The station is on the former Southern main line between Exeter and via . It is currently operated by Great Western Railway (GWR). History Bere Ferrers in 1964 The Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway opened the station on 2 June 1890 with its main line from to Devonport, which gave the London and South Western Railway a route into Plymouth that was independent of the Great Western Railway. The station was originally called Beer Ferris after the local Beer family who owned several nearby villages. However, in 1897, the railway authorities of the time decided that this name promoted an unrefined image of the village due to the association with beer, and therefore changed the name to Bere Ferrers. The original spelling can still be seen on the sign on the signal box in the heritage centre. The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1936 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Southern Region from 1954 to 1959, and two coaches from 1960 to 1964. Through services from Lydford were withdrawn on 6 May 1968 and the line reduced to a single track on 7 September 1970. = 1917 accident = The station was the scene of a fatal railway accident on 24 September 1917. Ten soldiers from New Zealand were being transported from Plymouth to Salisbury following their arrival in Britain. At Bere Ferrers station they alighted from their troop train for a brief rest (on the wrong side of the train, between the tracks) and, being unaccustomed to British railways, were struck and killed by an oncoming express. The men are buried in a Plymouth war cemetery, and a plaque was unveiled in 2001 in their memory in the village centre. Services Bere Ferrers is served by GWR trains on the Tamar Valley Line from to . Connections with main line services can be made at Plymouth, although a small number of Tamar Valley services continue beyond Plymouth. Heritage Centre The sidings alongside the station form the Tamar Belle Heritage Centre. This includes some old carriages which are used as a restaurant and as camping coaches. The LSWR signal box was erected here in 1989/90 but was formerly at Pinhoe railway station on the outskirts of Exeter. Community railway The railway from Plymouth to Gunnislake is designated as a community railway and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \\"Tamar Valley Line\\" name. The Olde Plough Inn takes part in the Tamar Valley Line rail ale trail, which is designed to promote the use of the line.

After going through insolvency in 2008, the first team was forcibly relegated to the fifth-tier NRW-Liga. Promotion to fourth division Regionalliga West was accomplished in 2012, but the club continued to struggle while going back and forth between fourth and fifth league play. In 2017, the club had to file for insolvency for a second time. The club‚Äôs home ground is the Leimbachstadion, an arena that can host up to 18,500 people.  History  The early years = The club was founded in 1899 as the football department of a gymnastics club called Turnverein Jahn von 1879 Siegen, being one of the first clubs in Western Germany to offer organized football to its members. In 1923, it merged with Sportverein 07 Siegen to become an independent football club called Sportfreunde Siegen von 1899. The 1920s also marked the club's first ascension to the national level, competing in the Western German championship after claiming the crown in the district league four times in a row. Despite these results, the team did not qualify for the first division when German football was re-organized in the Third Reich. After World War II, the club initially could not match its pre-war successes until it won the German amateur championship in 1955 with a stunning 5‚Äì0 win over 05 Bad Homburg. Two years later, Sportfreunde captain Herbert Sch√§fer was called up by national coach Sepp Herberger to play for the German national team. In 1954, Sch√§fer had been the last player being cut from the team which went on to win the World Cup. To this day, Herbert Sch√§fer still ranks as one of the best players to ever wear a Sportfreunde jersey. Six years after winning the German amateur championship, Sportfreunde Siegen made the jump to professional football in 1961. When the Bundesliga was introduced in 1963, the club settled in the Regionalliga, which was the second highest division at the time. League games against renowned clubs such as Bayer Leverkusen, Fortuna D√ºsseldorf or Borussia M√∂nchengladbach were common during these days. After some years of struggle, Sportfreunde Siegen fought its way back to professional football in 1972, claiming the West German amateur championship and promoting to the second-tier Regionalliga once again. Siegen remained on the professional stage for two more years before the introduction of the 2. Bundesliga forced the club to withdraw from this level in 1974. For the following twelve years, Sportfreunde Siegen continuously played in Germany's third division. After several ups and downs in the late 1980s and early '90s, the club made it back to third-tier Regionalliga in 1997, narrowly missing out on the promotion to the 2. Bundesliga by one game in 1999. In the same year, the team advanced to the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal, the German cup, before losing to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg in a highly contested match. = Recent history = Club logo until 2015 The first decade of the new millennium turned out to be the most eventful in the club's rich history. After a last-minute victory on the last match day of the 2004‚Äì05 campaign, the club was finally promoted to 2. Bundesliga. Local hero and future German international Patrick Helmes led the team with 21 goals. The following season saw the refurbishment of Leimbachstadion, the club's home ground since 1957, to its current capacity of 18,700 and quite decent results in the first half of the 2005‚Äì06 campaign in the 2. Bundesliga. German football heavyweight VfL Bochum was beaten 3‚Äì0, as was SC Freiburg. However, after a lacklustre performance in the second half of the season, the team was not able to avoid relegation. Two years later, Sportfreunde Siegen had to file for insolvency after failing to qualify for the newly established 3. Liga. The club managed to resume operations in fifth-division NRW-Liga. It returned to the Regionalliga West with the 2012‚Äì13 campaign and came in fifth in its first season back in semi-professional football, repeating this result in the following season. The team finished second-last in the Regionalliga in 2015 and was relegated from the league but bounced back immediately by winning the Oberliga Westfalen championship. Following another relegation they have been again playing in the Oberliga since 2017.  Management  The club is chaired by Roland Sch√∂ler. Dominik Dapprich serves as head coach.

It lies on the city boundary of Victorville and Adelanto. It is at elevation in Victor Valley north of the San Bernardino mountain range. It is located on old Route 66 near Interstate 15 between Victorville and Barstow. The ZIP code is 92368 and the community is inside area codes 442 and 760. Less than 1,000 residents live in the unincorporated area. Neighboring townships include Silver Lakes, Helendale, Adelanto and Victorville. History The Bank of Oro Grande Located along the Mojave River, the vicinity of Oro Grande was the location for Native American settlements hundreds of years. The river was also the part of a trade route from the Colorado River for tribes in the southwest with those on the coast of Southern California, what was called the Mohave Trail. Followed by Spanish padres and soldiers, and later American fur trappers and New Mexican traders the Mohave Trail became part of the Old Spanish Trail between New Mexico and California from 1830. After the Americans acquired California in the Mexican American War, Mormon pioneers developed a wagon road from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles on the western part of the Old Spanish Trail crossing the Mojave River here just below the Lower Narrows of the Mojave River. In 1859, Aaron G. Lane established the a ranch and store for travelers on the road at this crossing, that came to be called Lane's Crossing. This was the first settlement on the Mojave River. He sold out in 1865 and moved down river to establish a ranch at Bryman, and others took over his old ranch.Richard D. and Kathryn L. Thompson, Pioneer of the Mojave: The Life and Times of Aaron G. Lane, Desert Knolls Press, Apple Valley, California, October 1, 1995 In January, 1873, a strike found ore that ran $160 in gold and $18 in silver per ton at Silver Mountain east of Lane's new ranch, led to the organization of the Silver Mountain Mining District. In 1880, other strikes found $2,000 a ton in silver and $18,000 per ton in gold to the southwest led to the organization of the Red Mountain Gold and Silver Mining District and the construction of the mining town of Oro Grande almost 2 miles below Lane's old crossing east of the river. It was named after the first mine found, the Oro Grande Mine. The first houses were built and a post office established called Halleck in January 1881. A stamp mill for these mines was installed on the river, and later used for those of Calico. From 1887, limestone quarries opened and two kilns were produced lime for cement. From 1907, cement was made in Oro Grande. Marble was also mined.Emile Huguenin, Frederick James Hamilton Merrill, W.

It has a population of 13,243 inhabitants according to the . The city is located on a natural port of excellent quality, with an abrupt ravine and great depth (dredged up to in 2006, it is the last deepwater, Panamax- capable port on the Paran√°). The city is home to an industrial complex and a major commercial terminal for agricultural exports (cereals, vegetable oils, etc.), managing 50% of the Argentine exports of soybean. The industrial and agricultural development, secondary to the swift recovery from the Argentine economic crisis of the late 1990s, is however an important source of pollution. History The acknowledged founder of the town was Guillermo Kirk, a Scottish immigrant that came to Argentina in 1866 and became a farmer, working mainly in cereal crops. On 7 April 1879 Kirk bought a few portions of land on the shore of the Paran√° River, for the purpose of laying down a village and devote the rest of the land to agriculture. In 1888 Kirk sent a letter to the provincial governor proposing this idea, calling the town Linda Vista (\\"Nice View\\") and attaching a plan. The government approved the necessary documents on 16 February 1889, deciding on the name Kirkton. In the end the town was not built in the proposed site, and Kirk returned to Scotland in 1898, after his Argentine wife died. Puerto General San Mart√≠n officially became a city in 1987. The current name is an homage to General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, leader of the Argentine War of Independence from Spain and Liberator of several other South American countries.

Madhubuti (born Don Luther Lee on February 23, 1942, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States) is an African-American author, educator, and poet, as well as a publisher and operator of black-themed bookstore. Madhubuti is a much sought-after poet and lecturer, and has convened workshops and served as guest/keynote speaker at thousands of colleges, universities, libraries and community centers in the U.S. and abroad. The name Haki means \\"just\\" or \\"justice,\\" and Madhubuti means \\"precise, accurate and dependable,\\" both names deriving from the Swahili language. He changed his name in 1974. Biography Born Donald Luther Lee in Little Rock, Arkansas, Madhubuti adopted his current Swahili name after visiting Africa in the early 1970s. Madhubuti was raised in Detroit, Michigan, with his mother until the age of 16, when she died from a drug overdose. Madhubuti claims that his mother, Maxine, is the prime force behind his creativity and interest in the Black Arts. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1960 to 1963, Madhubuti received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. Haki Madhubuti became deeply interested in and influenced by the Black Arts and figures such as Richard Wright at an early age. He is a major contributor to the Black literary tradition, in particular through his early association with the Black Arts Movement beginning in the mid-1960s, and has had a lasting and major influence. Recognizing the lack of resources and institutions dedicated to black scholars, Madhubuti has become a leading proponent of independent Black institutions. He is the founder, publisher, and chairman of the board of Third World Press (established in 1967), which today is the largest independent black-owned press in the United States.Amy Alexander, \\"Tavis Smiley's Covenant\\", The Nation, September 18, 2006. In December 1967, Haki R. Madhubuti met with Carolyn Rodgers and Johari Amini in the basement of a South Side Chicago apartment to found Third World Press, an outlet for African- American literature. Forty years later in 2007, the company continued to thrive in a multimillion-dollar facility. Over the years, this press would publish works for Pulitzer Prize-winning author Gwendolyn Brooks, as well as Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Sterling Plumpp and Pearl Cleage. Heavily influenced by his creative predecessor Gwendolyn Brooks, Madhubuti's poetry is similar marked by a rhythmic, experimental style, frequently in the free verse form. Also like Brooks, Madhubuti's poetic bibliography is characterized by a shift from the personal to the political over the span of his career. He has dedicated a number of poems to her and is the founder and previously the director emeritus of the Gwendolyn Brooks Center for Black Literature and Creative Writing.Haki R. Madhubuti, \\"Gwendolyn Brooks\\", Poetry Foundation. Over the years, he has published 28 books (some under his former name, \\"Don L.

His subsequent books include Claiming Earth: Race, Rage, Rape, Redemption (1994), GroundWork: New and Selected Poems 1966‚Äì1996 (1996), and HeartLove: Wedding and Love Poems (1998). Madhubuti has also co-edited two volumes of literary works from Gallery 37: releasing The Spirit (1998), and Describe the Moment (2000). His poetry and essays were published in over 30 anthologies from 1997 to 2001. He also wrote Tough Notes: A Healing Call For Creating Exceptional Black Men (2002). Perhaps his most famous work, Black Men: Obsolete, Single, Dangerous?: The African American Family in Transition, a nonfiction book about African American social issues, was published in 1990 and has sold more than 1,000,000 copies. Besides co-founding a publishing company, Madhubuti is the co-founder of the Institute of Positive Education/New Concept Development Center (established in 1969), and co-founder of the Betty Shabazz International Charter School (established 1998) in Chicago, Illinois.

Most member countries do not treat citizens from other Commonwealth states any differently from foreign nationals, but some grant limited citizenship rights to resident Commonwealth citizens. In 16 member states, non-local Commonwealth citizens living in those countries are eligible to vote in elections. The notability of Commonwealth citizen status is mostly limited to the United Kingdom.  Background  Commonwealth citizenship was a creation that arose from the end of the British Empire. Before 1949, all citizens of the British Empire were British subjects and owed allegiance to the Crown.. Although the Dominions (Australia, Canada, Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa) created their own nationality laws following the First World War,. they mutually maintained British subjecthood as a common nationality with the United Kingdom and its colonies. However, divergence in Dominion legislation and growing assertions of independence from London culminated in the creation of Canadian citizenship in 1946 and its separation from British subject status.. Combined with the impending independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, nationality law reform was necessary at that point.. The British Nationality Act 1948 redefined British subject as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth citizen was also defined in this Act to have the same meaning.. This change in naming indicated a shift in the base theory of British nationality, that allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to hold British subject status.. The change was also necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries that wished to become republics rather than retain the monarch as head of state.. The common status of Commonwealth citizenship would instead be maintained voluntarily by the various members of the Commonwealth. At first, all Commonwealth citizens held the automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom.. This was first restricted by Parliament with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which imposed immigration controls on subjects originating from outside the British Islands.. The Immigration Act 1971 relaxed controls on patrials, those whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom,. and gave effective preferential treatment to Commonwealth citizens from white-majority countries.. Outside of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth citizens also initially retained in some member states eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. These privileges were removed on independence in most countries but retained in some. British subjects/Commonwealth citizens were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975,. Canada on the federal level until 1975 (not fully phased out in provinces until 2006), and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible).. By the 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent. Parliament updated nationality law to reflect the more modest geographical boundaries of the United Kingdom and its remaining territories.. The British Nationality Act 1981 redefined British subject to no longer also mean Commonwealth citizen.. That term now only refers to a limited group of people connected with Ireland and British India born before 1949.  Acquisition and loss  Countries whose citizens have Commonwealth citizenship. Zimbabwe is a former Commonwealth state whose citizens continue to have this status, and the Maldives is a recently rejoined member whose citizens have not yet been granted the status again. Commonwealth citizenship is acquired by virtue of being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. or country listed in Schedule 3 of the British Nationality Act 1981. This list closely follows the composition of the organisation, but is not always the same.. For example, the Maldives left the Commonwealth in 2016 before rejoining in 2020. The country was removed from Schedule 3 in 2017,. but legislation has not yet been updated to relist it. Similarly, although Zimbabwe has not been a part of the Commonwealth since 2003, Zimbabwean citizens retain Commonwealth citizenship because the country remains on Schedule 3. Most classes of British nationals other than British citizens are also considered Commonwealth citizens. British Overseas Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British subjects, and British Nationals (Overseas) all have this additional status. However, British protected persons and non-citizen nationals of other Commonwealth countries (such as Overseas Citizens of India) are not considered Commonwealth citizens. Acquisition and loss of Commonwealth citizenship is tied to the domestic nationality regulations of each member state; there is no separate process for obtaining this status. It is automatically lost if an individual is no longer a citizen or qualified national of a member state,. or if their country is removed from Schedule 3.  Rights and privileges  Commonwealth citizens have different entitlements in each Commonwealth country, which individually have separate legislation specifying what, if any, rights they are afforded.. The organization does not have a permissive system of free movement or labour. and in over half of the member states, Commonwealth citizens do not receive substantially different treatment than foreign nationals.. In 16 countries and all three Crown dependencies of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth citizens may register to vote after fulfilling residence requirements. In Australia, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands, they no longer have the right to register as electors, but voters who were already registered before that right was ended may continue to participate in elections. Commonwealth citizens are also eligible to serve in one or both houses of the national legislature in Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United Kingdom.. All Commonwealth citizens may receive consular assistance from British embassies and consulates in foreign non- Commonwealth nations where their home countries have not established diplomatic or consular posts. They are eligible to apply for British emergency passports, if their travel documents have been lost or stolen and permission has been given by their national governments. Additionally, Australia issues Documents of Identity in exceptional circumstances to resident Commonwealth citizens who are unable to obtain valid travel documents from their countries of origin and must travel urgently. When residing in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth citizens are generally exempt from registering with local police, may be employed in non-reserved Civil Service posts, and are eligible to enlist in the British Armed Forces. = Right to vote = The following jurisdictions allow citizens of other Commonwealth countries to vote: {     valign=top  * . ** ** **  } Access to voting in these countries is open to all resident foreign nationals and not exclusive to Commonwealth citizens:   References  Citations  Sources = Legislation   * *  Publications     * Category:British nationality law Category:Nationality law Category:Law of the United Kingdom Category:Citizenship ","title":"Commonwealth citizen"},{"id":"2731208","text":"Galanthus nivalis, the snowdrop or common snowdrop, is the best-known and most widespread of the 20 species in its genus, Galanthus. Snowdrops are among the first bulbs to bloom in spring and can form impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. They should not be confused with the snowflakes, in the genera Leucojum and Acis. Naming The generic name Galanthus, from the Greek gala (milk) and anthos (flower), was given to the genus by Carl Linnaeus in 1735. He described Galanthus nivalis in his ' published in 1753. The epithet means \\"of the snow\\", referring either to the snow-like flower or the plant's early flowering. The common name snowdrop first appeared in the 1633 edition of John Gerard's Great Herbal (in the first edition (1597) he described it as the \\"Timely flowring Bulbus violet\\"). The derivation of the name is uncertain, although it may have come from the German word Schneetropfen, which was a type of earring popular around that time. Other British traditional common names include \\"February fairmaids\\", \\"dingle- dangle\\", \\"Candlemas bells\\", \\"Mary's tapers\\" and, in parts of Yorkshire, \\"snow piercers\\" (like the French name ').

It is considered naturalised in Great Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and parts of North America (Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Ontario, Massachusetts, Alabama, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Washington state, New York state, Michigan, Utah, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Galanthus nivalisBiota of North America Program Although often thought of as a British native wild flower, or to have been brought to the British Isles by the Romans, it is now thought that it was probably introduced much later, perhaps around the early sixteenth century. Description Common snowdropuprightGalanthus nivalis grows to around 7‚Äì15 cm tall, flowering between January and April in the northern temperate zone (January‚ÄìMay in the wild). They are perennial, herbaceous plants which grow from bulbs. Each bulb generally produces two linear, or very narrowly lanceolate, greyish-green leaves and an erect, leafless scape (flowering stalk), which bears at the top a pair of bract-like spathe valves joined by a papery membrane. From between them emerges a solitary, pendulous, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender pedicel. The flower consists of six tepals, also referred to as segments. The outer three are larger and more convex than the inner ones. The inner flower segments are usually marked on their outer surface with a green or greenish-yellow V- or U-shaped mark (sometimes described as \\"bridge-shaped\\") over the small sinus (notch) at the tip of each tepal. The inner surface has a faint green mark covering all or most of it. Occasionally plants are found with green markings on the outer surface of the outer tepals. The six long, pointed anthers open by pores or short slits. The ovary is three-celled, ripening into a three-celled capsule. Each whitish seed has a small, fleshy tail (the elaiosome) containing substances attractive to ants which distribute the seeds. The leaves die back a few weeks after the flowers have faded. G. nivalis is a cross-pollinating plant, but sometimes self-pollination takes place. It is pollinated by bees. Cultivation and propagation See Galanthus: Propagation. Active substances Snowdrops contain an active substance called galantamine (or galanthamine) which can be helpful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, though it is not a cure. Snowdrops contain also an active lectin or agglutinin named GNA for Galanthus nivalis agglutinin. Potatoes have been genetically modified with the GNA gene. In 1998 √Årp√°d Pusztai said in an interview on a World in Action programme that his group had observed damage to the intestines and immune systems of rats fed the genetically modified potatoes. He also said \\"If I had the choice I would certainly not eat it\\", and that \\"I find it's very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs\\". These remarks started the so-called Pusztai affair. Cultivars Galanthus nivalis has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The common double snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Flore Pleno', had appeared by 1703, when it was illustrated in The Duchess of Beaufort's Book. It spread (and was spread) rapidly through northern Europe (by vegetative means, as it sets no seed). With 3‚Äì5 outer segments and 12‚Äì21 inner segments, which are often misshapen, the flowers may be less attractive to the eye of the purist than single-flowered or neater double cultivars, but they are good value in the garden as the bulbs spread rapidly and the large flowers show up well. There are numerous named cultivars of G. nivalis, single, semi-double, double and \\"poculiform\\" (meaning goblet or cup-shaped, this refers to flowers with inner segments that are almost the same shape and length as the outer ones). Apart from these traits they differ particularly in the size and markings of the flower and the period of flowering; other characteristics are less obvious to the untrained eye and are mainly of interest to \\"galanthophiles\\". =Some single-flowered cultivars= * Galanthus nivalis 'Anglesey Abbey' ‚Äì green-leaved (rather than the usual greyish-green) and vigorous, with some flowers poculiform, some semi- poculiform and others normal. This cultivar (discovered at Anglesey Abbey, Lode, Cambridgeshire, UK, the source of several good cultivars) was at first identified as belonging to G.lagodechianus, a rarely grown green-leafed species, or a hybrid between it and G. nivalis, but has now been shown to be an unusual variant of G. nivalis Galanthus nivalis 'Atkinsii', 18 cm high Galanthus nivalis 'Viridapice' * G. nivalis 'Atkinsii' ‚Äì Allen reported to the RHS 1891 Snowdrop Meeting: this is \\"second to none in size, form, quality and freedom of growth.\\" \\"James Atkins of Painswick received it from a friend, presumably in the 1860s ... He gave this snowdrop to Canon Ellacombe\\" of Bitton who widely distributed it. * G. nivalis 'Blonde Inge' ‚Äì mark on inner segments is yellow, sometimes rather bronzy or \\"tarnished\\"-looking, although the ovary is green (unlike most \\"yellow\\" snowdrops). Discovered near Cologne, Germany, in 1977 * G. nivalis Poculiformis Group ‚Äì inner segments are almost same length and shape as outer ones, usually unmarked and without a \\"sinus\\" (notch); includes such cultivars as 'Sandhill Gate' * G. nivalis Sandersii Group ‚Äì ovary and marks on inner segments are yellow instead of green; leaves and flower-stalks may also be slightly yellowish; includes those plants known as 'Flavescens', 'Lutescens' and 'Sandersii', and more recent cultivars such as 'Ray Cobb' and 'Savill Gold'. 'Sandersii' was the first to be named (as G. nivalis var. sandersii) in 1877; it was found near Belford, Northumberland; 'Flavescens', a taller, finer clone, was found in a cottage garden in Whittingham, Northumberland in 1889 (and named G. flavescens). Yellow-flowered snowdrops are relatively frequent in woodlands in Northumberland but seem to be decreasing, perhaps due to illegal collecting. They tend to be less vigorous than normal G. nivalis and may prove difficult to grow * G. nivalis Scharlockii Group ‚Äì \\"donkey's ears snowdrops\\" have an elongated, foliose spathe that is split down the centre, resembling upright ears. The Group is very variable in height. The original 'Scharlockii' was found in the Nahe valley, Germany, and named in 1868; it has green markings on its outer segments. Seedlings have been raised from it that have the split spathe but no green outer markings, or that have the markings but a normal spathe. Double- flowered seedlings have also arisen * G. nivalis 'Snow White's Gnome' ‚Äì at less than 5 cm tall in flower, this is possibly the world's smallest snowdrop cultivar. Found in the Czech Republic in 1990, it has relatively long, upright spathes, around half the height of the entire flowering shoot. The flowers are albino (with no markings at all), or almost so, with only two tiny dots per inner segment * G. nivalis 'Viridapice' ‚Äì variable in size and vigour (some larger plants have been shown to be triploid), the flowers have green-tipped outer segments; the spathe may be normal, or elongated and inflated or foliose; found in northern Holland by JMC Hoog of the famous Dutch bulb company; painted by EA Bowles in 1916 * G. nivalis 'Virescens' ‚Äì \\"the original green snowdrop\\" (dating from with large areas of pale green covering roughly two-thirds of the outer segments (nearest the ovary, not extending to the tips). Narrow flowers, with rather flattened outer segments, flaring outward at the tips. Late flowering, often into April * G. nivalis 'Warei' ‚Äì a very sturdy triploid, with green-tipped outer segments, similar to 'Viridapice' but larger, with enormous foliose spathes up to 11 cm long. Originated in 1886 among some bulbs of G. nivalis 'Scharlockii' =Some double-flowered cultivars= A double snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Flore Pleno'* G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Blewbury Tart' ‚Äì curious, untidy, upward- or outward-facing flowers with dark green markings in the centre; found in Blewbury, UK, in 1975 * G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Doncaster's Double Scharlock' ‚Äì a loose double, with three to six outers, strongly tipped with green, and a long, upright split spathe (the two parts of which sometimes cross over each other); named after plantswoman Amy Doncaster, who grew it as 'Scharlockii Flore Pleno', thinking that it must be the same as the double raised from seed of 'Scharlockii' by nurseryman James Allen early in the 20th century, but a contemporary drawing of the original plant shows it to have been less striking than this one * G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Flore Pleno' ‚Äì the most common double snowdrop, having three to five unmarked outer segments surrounding rosettes of numerous green-marked inner segments, usually of uneven length, giving a quite untidy appearance * G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Lady Elphinstone' ‚Äì a version of 'Flore Pleno' with yellow colouring inside the flowers instead of green; may revert to the normal 'Flore Pleno' or vary from year to year; found in Cheshire, UK, in the late 19th century * G. nivalis f. pleniflorus 'Walrus' ‚Äì a curious double, its outers resemble narrow, tubular, greenish \\"tusks\\" up to 2.5 cm long, the inners usually form a neat, widely splayed rosette; the long foliose spathe may sometimes split, as in 'Scharlockii'; selected at Maidwell, Northamptonshire in the 1960s * \\"Spiky doubles\\" ‚Äì occasionally found among normal \\"wild\\" G. nivalis are bulbs that produce upward-facing tufts of narrow, quill-like segments, looking like a white, off-white, greenish shuttlecock or shaving brush. 'Boyd's Double', the first of these to be documented (found prior to 1905), is still the darkest green in colour; others include 'Cockatoo', 'Ermine Spiky' and 'Irish Green' Snowdrop gardens In the UK and Ireland, many gardens open specially in February for visitors to admire the flowers. These displays may attract large numbers of sightseers. Some feature extensive displays of naturalised G. nivalis; others have more specialised collections of many species, forms and cultivars.

Although many types of products can be defective, the term \\"lemon\\" is mostly used to describe defective motor vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles. United States Lemon law protection arises under state law, with every U.S. state and the District of Columbia having its own lemon law. Although the exact criteria vary by state, new vehicle lemon laws require that an auto manufacturer repurchase a vehicle that has a significant defect that the manufacturer is unable to repair within a reasonable amount of time. Lemon laws consider the nature of the problem with the vehicle, the number of days that the vehicle is unavailable to the consumer for service of the same mechanical issue, and the number of repair attempts made. If repairs cannot be completed within the total number of days described in the state statute, the manufacturer becomes obligated to buy back the defective vehicle. Contrary to popular belief, the dealership has no obligation to buy back the vehicle, because the dealership does not warrant the vehicle, the manufacturer does. Lemon laws offer remedies that exceed the scope of a vehicle manufacturer's warranty. While a manufacturer's warranty might obligate a vehicle manufacturer to make a repair at no cost to the consumer, warranties do not include maximum time periods for the completion of repair, nor do they trigger buy-back provisions if the repair cannot be completed within such a time period. Some state lemon laws cover only certain classes of vehicles, such as vehicles purchased for individual use but not for business use, or vehicles under a certain gross weight. A small number of states additionally have more limited lemon laws that cover used vehicles. New York State is one state with a used car lemon law. Some states have lemon laws that apply to pet purchases. =Federal law= There are two types of warranties for product purchases, express warranties and implied warranties. Express warranties make specific promises about product repair, and are usually made in writing. An express warranty may be provided by the manufacturers in owner's manuals and other written sales or marketing materials. Implied warranties arise from a manufacturer's duty to meet certain minimum standards of quality whereby the product is fit for use for the purpose intended. An implied warranty arises from the sale itself, and need not be in writing. In each type the manufacturer assumes the liability and responsibility to correct the defect and, in the event that they cannot meet that duty, may be required to repurchase or replace the product. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act was enacted as a federal law in 1975, and protects citizens of all states, to ensure that manufacturers honor their warranties and to reduce the chance that a consumer will be misled about the nature and scope of a warranty when making a purchase. The Act extends to the purchase of consumer products, including motor vehicles and appliances. The Act also provides that the warranter may be obligated to pay the prevailing party's attorney in a successful lawsuit, as do most state lemon laws. A consumer may pursue relief under both a state lemon law and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The existence, scope and consequence of express and implied warranties can vary under state law, and warranties for the sale of goods will often be addressed by Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act will not protect the buyer of a product purchased without a warranty, such as a product purchased \\"as is\\" or \\"with all faults\\", but may protect a consumer who was misled into waiving the protection of a warranty. Australia Australia does not have a law similar to a lemon law, so consumers do not have legal protection beyond the vehicle warranty. Consumers have been known to take creative measures to try to convince vehicle manufacturers to buy back defective vehicles. The Queensland Parliament recently conducted an inquiry on the need for a consumer lemon law for new motor vehicles. A report of the findings of the inquiry was published in November, 2015. Canada The Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAMVAP) is the dispute resolution program for Canadians who have problems with the assembly of their vehicle or with how the manufacturer implements its new vehicle warranty. CAMVAP covers new and used, owned and leased vehicles that are from the current model year and up to an additional four model years. CAMVAP is free for consumers, and hearings are held in the consumer's home community. The process normally takes less than 70 days from start to finish. Most consumers are able to handle their own case without the assistance of lawyers. The manufacturers do not use lawyers. Their representatives usually are serving or retired district parts and services representatives. An inspection of the vehicle normally is part of an arbitration hearing and the arbitrator can order a technical inspection of the vehicle at the program's expense if doing so is required. CAMVAP arbitrators can order the manufacturer to buy back the vehicle; repair it at the manufacturer's expense; pay for repairs already completed; or pay out of pocket expenses for items such as towing, diagnostic testing, rental cars and accommodation related to the problem with the vehicle. The arbitrator can also determine that the manufacturer has no liability. CAMVAP is available in all Canadian provinces and territories. European Union In the EU, Directive (UE) 2019/771 Rules on contracts for the sale of goods between sellers and consumers will apply from first January 2022, to replace regulation 2017/2394 and directive 2009/22/CE and directive 1999/44/CE. France In France, the Garantie des vices cach√©s en droit fran√ßais protect the buyer against Latent defect, in relation with the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Singapore A similar \\"Lemon Law\\" was passed in Singapore's parliament on September 1, 2012, to strengthen consumer protection laws. Singapore's Lemon Law applies to all goods (including consumables and perishables) but it does not apply to services. Under the law, consumers can report a defective item within six months of delivery and it is the responsibility of the retailer to prove that the defect did not exist at the time of delivery. The consumer may have the option to request for repair or a replacement, and if that is not possible, ask for a reduction in price, or even a refund.

There are three characters: Ann, her former boyfriend Dave, and her lover Patrick. Ann and Patrick are contentedly sitting at home one night, listening to music and talking, when Dave breaks in. His violent temper is clear from the beginning: He punches Patrick on the nose, then refuses to leave, even as Ann threatens to call the police. It soon turns out that Ann used Dave's work trip to Cyprus to break up with him as she had long planned to do. Now a colleague from work--her new boyfriend, Patrick-- has moved in with her. Dave refuses to accept the situation and demands an explanation, bullying Ann, and being overly friendly with Patrick. Ann seems determined not to listen to him, particularly when the two men bond against her. Dave tells her she would be bored out of her mind by Patrick, and asks her to marry him. She refuses. Dave, however, is crafty and clever enough to succeed: he wins her back and moves back in at the end, succeeding in making both of them miserable. Background The play grew out of Hampton's translation of Ibsen's A Doll's House. He noted, however, that in the 1970s there were probably as many women trapped in unsatisfactory relationships with abusive men as in the 1870s, and that Ibsen's play was no longer provocative enough. Treats was an instant box office success at the Royal Court and in the West End. In March 2007, it was revived in London in an updated version, at the Garrick Theatre with a cast including Billie Piper, her real-life husband Laurence Fox, and Kris Marshall. In his review of the new production, Michael Billington thought the credibility of Ann being \\"forced to choose between an amiable wimp and a destructive neurotic\\" even less credible than he had in the era of Women's lib in 1976.

Glide planes are noted by a, b or c, depending on which axis the glide is along. If the axis is not defined, then the glide plane may be noted by g. When the glide plane is parallel to the screen, these planes may be indicated by a bent arrow in which the arrowhead indicates the direction of the glide. When the glide plane is perpendicular to the screen, these planes can be represented either by dashed lines when the glide is parallel to the plane of the screen or dotted lines when the glide is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. Additionally, a centered lattice can cause a glide plane to exist in two directions at the same time. This type of glide plane may be indicated by a bent arrow with an arrowhead on both sides when the glide plan is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed and double-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. There is also the n glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the d glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell . The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. The n glide plane may be indicated by diagonal arrow when it is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. A d glide plane may be indicated by a diagonal half-arrow if the glide plane is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line with arrows if the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. If a d glide plane is present in a crystal system, then that crystal must have a centered lattice. Formal treatment In geometry, a glide plane operation is a type of isometry of the Euclidean space: the combination of a reflection in a plane and a translation in that plane. Reversing the order of combining gives the same result. Depending on context, we may consider a reflection a special case, where the translation vector is the zero vector. The combination of a reflection in a plane and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel plane. However, a glide plane operation with a nonzero translation vector in the plane cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with any translation is a glide plane operation in the general sense, with as special case just a reflection. The glide plane operation in the strict sense and the pure reflection are two of the four kinds of indirect isometries in 3D. The isometry group generated by just a glide plane operation is an infinite cyclic group. Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide plane operation, so the even powers of the glide plane operation form a translation group. In the case of glide plane symmetry, the symmetry group of an object contains a glide plane operation, and hence the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing glide plane symmetry, the translation vector of any glide plane operation is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and translational symmetry.

Moomin Museum (Swedish: Muminmuseet, Finnish: Muumimuseo, formerly called Moominvalley) is situated in the city of Tampere, Finland. Shown at the Moomin Museum are illustrations by Tove Jansson (the creator of Moomins), 40 miniatures, tableaux about Moomin events and a small (2.5 metres high) Moomin House. There are about 2,000 exhibits on display. Also shown is the original Moominvalley multimedia. The Moomin Shop sells gift items and the Moomin Library offers Moomin books in many languages. History The blue five-storey miniature Moominhouse was built by Tuulikki Pietil√§, Pentti Eistola and Tove Jansson in the late 1970s. The original idea was to make it round, as Jansson always depicted it in her illustrations for the Moomin stories, but since it was to be displayed in a corner at the Bratislava biennale of illustrations in 1979, they decided to make it square instead. No blueprints were made, the house was built freely, floor by floor. It does not follow any particular architectural style but is influenced by many different styles. The ground floor was sketched by Tuulikki Pietil√§'s brother, architect Reima Pietil√§.Mirja Kivi: Mumindalen, figurerna som kom p√• museum, 2000: Schildts F√∂rlag Ab, page 84-85 Originally, a world tour was planned for the house after the 1979 biennale, but eventually it went on tour only in the Nordic countries in 1980-83. Then it was taken to Jansson's studio as it needed some repairs after the tour. It was displayed again at the Art Museum of Tampere in 1986 before gaining its permanent location at the new Moomin Museum, where it has been on display since 1987.Mirja Kivi: Mumindalen, figurerna som kom p√• museum, 2000: Schildts F√∂rlag Ab, page 86-88 Photos of the Moomin House serve as illustrations in An Unwanted Guest, the last of Jansson's four picture books about Moominvalley. Until the end of 2012, the Moomin Museum was in the basement of the Metso building of the city library. In December 2012, the museum moved into the Tampere Art Museum basement. During the move, a small collection of Tove Jansson's Moomin illustrations were on display in the Vapriikki Museum Centre. The fully renovated Moomin Valley opened on January 2, 2013. The Moomin statue outside the Metso building remained in place. In 2016, the museum moved into Tampere Hall and was renamed the Moomin Museum. The Moomin statue was also moved to its new place. The museum opened in June 2017.

She has two children. Biography Flood Beaubrun was educated at the Castries Comprehensive Secondary School and Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in St. Lucia and subsequently at the University of Hull where she obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LLB-Hons). She did post-graduate Law at the University of Westminster, leading to a degree of Utter Barrister, and was called to the Bar of England and Wales (1995) and the Bar of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (1995). She was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1997 (dead) to represent the Castries Central constituency beating the then sitting Prime Minister, and was subsequently re-elected in 2001. The election of Flood Beaubrun and Menissa Rambally in 1997 and 2001, according to Cynthia Barrow-Giles, \\"transformed the St Lucia lower House of parliament from a virtual 'all boys camp' to a more gender integrated elected parliament\\". Flood Beaubrun served as Minister of Health, Human Services, Family Affairs and Gender Relations in the SLP administration during the first term and during the second term as Minister of Home Affairs and Gender Relations. In her various capacities as a Minister from 1997 to 2004, Flood Beaubrun oversaw the construction of the first new correctional institution in St. Lucia for over 100 years, the complete upgrading and revamping to international standards of the main intake area of the islands primary medical institution, the establishment of the 1st women‚Äôs support center for abused women, the creation of the 1st Mother to Child HIV prevention of transmission program in St. Lucia, plus other programs. Under her focus and leadership she brought a completely new concentration on the appallingly ignored issue of mental health treatment and incarceration of the mentally challenged in St. Lucia. This focus and spotlighting subsequently led to the establishment of a new mental health institution in St. Lucia. Following the general election in December 2006 Sarah Flood Beaubrun was historically selected as St. Lucia's first female Speaker of the House of Assembly effective 9 January 2007. Flood Beaubrun in September 2008 was subsequently appointed Deputy Permanent Representative for St. Lucia at the United Nations in New York and was succeeded in the role of Speaker of the House of Assembly by another woman, Rosemary Husbands-Mathurin Flood Beaubrun has established a strong reputation in St. Lucia, the Caribbean and internationally as a persuasive defender of human rights and dignity. She has spoken in various Caribbean fora on these issues and their relation to good governance in the region. Flood Beaubrun again contested and won the Castries Central seat on the United Workers Party ticket in the 2016 general election. She was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly on 12 July 2016.

Cumming and Masson met at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and united after several solo projects to create the theatrical BBC sitcom, The High Life. The two leads were based heavily on their famous Scottish comedy alter-egos, Victor and Barry. The series followed the cabin crew at the fictional airline, Air Scotia, flying out of Prestwick Airport. The crew consisted of the camp, alcohol-loving, narcissistic and vindictive steward, Sebastian; his sex- obsessed colleague Steve; their up-tight, antagonistic chief stewardess, Shona Spurtle; and the eccentric pilot, Captain Hilary Duff. Sebastian and Steve longed to be promoted to long-haul flights to see exotic locations, instead of the current short-haul trips with their superior Shona, played by Siobhan Redmond, whom they described as 'Hitler in tights', 'Mussolini in Micromesh' and 'Goebbels in a Gossard'. The deranged pilot, Captain Duff, played by Patrick Ryecart, would need to be frequently reminded who he was, where the cockpit was and where he was flying to. The High Life was interspersed with surrealism, childish humour, sarcasm and theatrical song and dance numbers. It only ran for one series due to Cumming's increasingly successful film career in Hollywood; however during an interview, Masson claims that a second series was written, yet not acted upon. Despite its short run, it is remembered for Steve and Sebastian‚Äôs joint catchphrase: 'Oh deary me!' and for the opening sequence which featured the cast performing a dance routine to the title song. During an interview on BBC television, Cumming noted that he accidentally mimed a Hitler-style salute during the opening sequence, due to being in the musical Cabaret at the time. The series ran for six thirty-minute episodes. An initial pilot was broadcast in the Comic Asides anthology strand on BBC2 at 9pm on Sunday 9 January 1994. The series of six episodes were broadcast on Friday nights at 9.30pm between 6 January and 10 February 1995. The entire series (including the pilot) was released on VHS and DVD in 2002, and was re- released in May 2009. The complete series was re-run on BBC Four early in 2009 and BBC Scotland in 2019.

All processes have inherent statistical variability which can be evaluated by statistical methods. The process capability is a measurable property of a process to the specification, expressed as a process capability index (e.g., Cpk or Cpm) or as a process performance index (e.g., Ppk or Ppm). The output of this measurement is often illustrated by a histogram and calculations that predict how many parts will be produced out of specification (OOS). Two parts of process capability are: 1) measure the variability of the output of a process, and 2) compare that variability with a proposed specification or product tolerance. Measure the process The input of a process usually has at least one or more measurable characteristics that are used to specify outputs. These can be analyzed statistically; where the output data shows a normal distribution the process can be described by the process mean (average) and the standard deviation. A process needs to be established with appropriate process controls in place. A control chart analysis is used to determine whether the process is \\"in statistical control\\" If the process is not in statistical control then capability has no meaning. Therefore, the process capability involves only common cause variation and not special cause variation. A batch of data needs to be obtained from the measured output of the process. The more data that is included the more precise the result, however an estimate can be achieved with as few as 17 data points. This should include the normal variety of production conditions, materials, and people in the process. With a manufactured product, it is common to include at least three different production runs, including start-ups. The process mean (average) and standard deviation are calculated. With a normal distribution, the \\"tails\\" can extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations, but this interval should contain about 99.73% of production output. Therefore, for a normal distribution of data the process capability is often described as the relationship between six standard deviations and the required specification. Capability study The output of a process is expected to meet customer requirements, specifications, or engineering tolerances. Engineers can conduct a process capability study to determine the extent to which the process can meet these expectations. The ability of a process to meet specifications can be expressed as a single number using a process capability index or it can be assessed using control charts. Either case requires running the process to obtain enough measurable output so that engineering is confident that the process is stable and so that the process mean and variability can be reliably estimated. Statistical process control defines techniques to properly differentiate between stable processes, processes that are drifting (experiencing a long-term change in the mean of the output), and processes that are growing more variable. Process capability indices are only meaningful for processes that are stable (in a state of statistical control).

Portrayed by Ryan Thomas, the character first appeared on screen on 25 December 2000. It was announced in October 2015 that Thomas had quit the role of Jason, and the character departed on 29 June 2016. Jason is the son of Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and Tony Stewart (Alan Igbon; Terence Maynard), but he did not know his father for many years, his younger brother is Todd (Bruno Langley). Jason's storylines have mostly revolved around his relationships with various women including, Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan), Stella Price (Michelle Collins), Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) and Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley). His other storylines have included being attacked by his enemy Callum Logan (Sean Ward); grieving for his father, Tony, after he dies off-screen; and becoming a suspect in Callum's murder. He leaves Weatherfield after being manipulated to by his mother's new boyfriend, Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). Storylines Jason is the eldest son of Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and Tony Stewart (Alan Igbon/Terence Maynard). Jason does not know his father for many years, but they reunite in 2003. Upon his arrival, he is an aspiring runner - something which Eileen does not completely approve of. He works for a brief period in Sally Webster's (Sally Dynevor) electrical shop in 2001 until the failing business catches fire and is permanently closed down. He finds a traumatised Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) lying in the ginnel, following her rape in April 2001, while out jogging early one morning. Although Jason has had many romances, all of them were short-lived since he has phobia to commitment. He has had many flings with street residents, Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) and Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). He seemed to have settled down with Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt), even uncharacteristically promising to care for her when he thought she was pregnant. Jason is stunned to learn about Violet sharing a drunken kiss with his friend/employer, Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). He attempts to continue the relationship but is unable to forgive Violet and ends their relationship. During their separation, he starts dating Sarah and despite reconciling with Violet, he continues his affair with her. Eventually, Violet discovers the affair and dumps Jason. Separated from Violet again, Jason and Sarah continue their relationship, much to the dismay of their mothers. Their relationship struggles initially as Sarah feels insecure about his feelings for Violet and the fact he proposed to Sarah while still with Violet, leading to a showdown in which Sarah ends her relationship with Jason in the Rovers. After days of constant quarrels, Jason ultimately decides to get back with Sarah and after she refuses to speak to him, Jason breaks into her house and proposes. She accepts, although they suffer further disapproval from their mothers. They announce their engagement in the Rovers in Violet's presence, which Sarah wants to do to make a point. The wedding, though, is a disaster. Jason decides he cannot commit and flees through a toilet window at the venue, leaving Sarah heartbroken. After months of ignoring Jason, Sarah reunites with him. However, on Christmas Day 2006, Jason has a major surprise delivered to the front door in the shape of a baby - his little girl by a young woman called Emma (Stephanie Waring). It later turns out that baby Holly is the baby of Charlie Stubbs. Out of revenge for his family disowning him, David loosens the bolts on the scaffolding at the builder's yard on 22 October 2007, a week before Jason and Sarah's wedding. Later, David decides that it was a bad idea, however he gets to the builder's yard to see Jason leaning on the balcony. When Bill jumps on him as a joke, the two of them fall onto the street below, Bill on top of Jason. In the hospital, Jason is told that he might not walk again for some time. He is on crutches at his and Sarah's wedding. Sarah asks Jason to take her wedding dress to the cleaners but he accidentally leaves it in Roy's Rolls where David picks it up and puts it in a puddle before putting it in a bin bag with other bits and pieces that the Morton kids get from their neighbours. The Mortons' Guy Fawkes gets first prize and, as the dress burns, Sarah recognizes it as her wedding dress before Jason admits that he lost it. Sarah knows immediately that this is David's doing. Jason, Sarah and her daughter Bethany (Amy & Emily Walton) are set to leave for Milan on 30 December 2007, after Sarah gets a job from her uncle Stephen (Todd Boyce). Jason backs out when Sarah admits that she planted drugs in David's drawer at the salon, thereby ruining his chances of Stephen offering him the job in Milan. On New Year's Eve 2007, Jason and Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) kiss as the midnight bells chimes, and on 1 February 2008, they have sex. Jason regrets it afterwards and visits Sarah in Milan to tell her he had cheated on her with Becky. Instead of forgiving him, she attacks him, giving him a black eye. When he returns to the Street, Becky hits him too. Several months later, Jason and Becky have sex again and they become a couple. However, they argue when Jason wants a night in alone. In October 2008, Jason discovers that Sarah is considering coming home. He immediately phones her and she agrees to give him another chance. Meanwhile, he is preparing to move in with Becky but dumps her and flies to Italy. Becky later attacks him in the Rovers for his betrayal. Everything backfires for Jason when he subsequently discovers that Sarah has decided to reconcile with her Italian boyfriend, just as he is going to Milan to meet her. On 16 February 2009, Jason and Becky sleep together and reunite after revealing that he and Sarah are divorcing. To prove to Becky that he is serious this time, he proposes and she accepts. Unfortunately, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) also proposes to Becky and although she initially decides to marry Jason, she realises she can not go through with it and calls off the engagement. In June 2009, Jason sleeps with David's ex- girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). They start dating, however when Tina tells David the truth about her and Jason, he turns nasty and starts throwing bricks at Jason. Jason fights back and the pair have to be separated by the locals. Tina and Jason buy No. 12a Coronation Street and move in together in July 2009. Jason and Tina redecorate the flat and hold a house- warming party in September 2009 but in November, a loan shark named Rick Neelan fakes interest in buying the flat, when he is actually waiting for Tina's father, Joe (Reece Dinsdale), about the debt he owes him. Before Christmas 2009, Tina and Jason row after it is discovered that Jason is still married to Sarah. In retaliation, she shares a kiss with Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), his brother-in-law. They reconcile however, and in January 2010, when Joe and Gail go on their honeymoon, he asks Jason to look out for Tina, who is in danger from the loan sharks. On 12 February, Jason gives Tina a Valentine's Day present of his divorce papers to Sarah. Tina thinks that is her full Valentine's Day present and goes to get alcohol to celebrate. When she returns, Jason proposes to her after she has seen the ring and she accepts. However, following Joe's sudden death, Tina struggles with her grief and ends her engagement to Jason and he moves out of the flat, though he reclaims it. On 2 April 2010, Jason gets drunk in the Rovers after Tina calls off their engagement. He later returns to the builder's yard where he is told to go home. However, when he turns to leave, Jason falls down the stairs and is rendered unconscious. He is taken to the hospital where he appears to be fine, apart from losing the memory of him and Tina breaking up. Eileen, worried about what he'll do, visits Tina's house where she informs her of Jason's amnesia, but Tina doesn't believe her. Jason's memory soon returns. Upon finding out Tina is now dating Graeme Proctor, he is angry that Tina slept with Graeme while she was with him and locks her out of the flat. Then he teams up with David (who was Graeme's best friend) to humiliate Tina and Graeme further; first by David using Graeme's clothes to mop up water (Graeme had handcuffed David to the Platts' radiator, and David then pulled it off the wall.) David then cut the hoods off Graeme's hoodies and the peaks off his caps and Jason throws binbags of Tina's clothes on top of her from the house's windows, all in front of a crowd. Satisfied, David and Jason end their partnership but remain close friends. On 24 September 2010, Jason is recruited by a half-naked Rosie Webster to drive her in Kevin's car to Sheffield to pick up Sophie (Brooke Vincent) and her girlfriend Sian (Sacha Parkinson) after they ran away together. Immediately, there is chemistry between the pair; on 18 October, Rosie books Owen to come round and redecorate the kitchen after the oven catches fire whilst Sally and Kevin are away. On the 21st, whilst Jason is busy with the Websters' kitchen, and Rosie is looking for a cab to take her to an important modelling job, she mentions that it is 'underwear modelling', so Jason offers to be her driver. With Jason not knowing what a 'green screen' is and the male model going AWOL, Rosie volunteers Jason to step in, and the pair complete the photoshoot together; with Jason looking very pleased with himself when they get home, they sleep together. The next day, Jason thinks he has done something wrong as Rosie is evasive and not paying him for the work he did on the kitchen; she eventually pays him and he buys her a 'fake' version of the handbag that she wanted and the pair sleep together again and agree to start dating. When the Joinery bar exploded, bringing a tram off the viaduct which smashes into the Corner Shop and The Kabin, Jason helps to rescue people who are trapped, including going into No.13 (which is in flames) to find Simon Barlow (Alex Bain). He finds him in a closet upstairs and they both escape, assisted by the fire brigade. Upon escaping, he is thanked gratefully by the Barlow family and praised by the residents for his courage. With Jason and Rosie living together, they start the new year looking out for Sophie and Sian as they get kicked out of the Websters. When Graeme convinces Claire to run away after she admits to the police that she attacked Tracy Barlow, Jason helps her and her sons escape and drives her to the airport, on 14 January. On 17 January, Eileen's money troubles get a lot worse, and number 11 starts crumbling around her; she seeks help from an insurance firm but when Jason spots a man lurking at the back of the house, he thinks he is trying to spy on Rosie and punches him, only to discover that he is the insurance inspector, which of course, affects the result and Eileen can not claim a penny. On 4 February, after Rosie agrees to go to a \\"mother and baby\\" photo shoot, which \\"pays a fortune\\", they convince Kevin to let them have Jack for the day but disaster strikes when they accidentally bring home a baby girl. Jason spots this, and just as they are about to swap the babies back, Kevin walks in and demands the truth. Jason admits what happened and Kevin goes looking for his son. He finds Jack but warns Rosie to stay away, expressing his disappointment in her. Despite this, Jason is good friends with Kevin and supports him when he wins ¬£200,000 on a scratchcard. When Kevin is almost crushed to death at the garage when his new car ramp malfunctions, Jason joins Rosie and her family at the hospital. Kevin orders Jason to call the ramp manufacturers to find the fault and threaten legal action if necessary. When it's revealed that the ramp was damaged deliberately, Jason is shocked and disgusted that someone would try to kill Kevin. In June, Jason celebrates his 28th birthday and Becky hosts a party for him in the Rovers. However, she orders a stripper and the party turns to all- out mayhem when Chris Gray (Will Thorp) has a go at Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel). A fight breaks out and this leads to a whole pub brawl, with Jason caught in the middle, things sent flying, the brawl going onto the street and a chair smashing the window. Though Jason is shaken, he is fine. In November 2011, Rosie tells Jason that she is showing a potential buyer around their flat (which they are selling), but they are unaware that the mystery buyer is actually Rosie's ex-kidnapper, John Stape (Graeme Hawley), who has returned to kidnap Rosie as he blames her for his wife, Fiz, being imprisoned for his crimes. Rosie and Jason have a brief argument which leads to her storming off to show 'Mr Chips' around the flat. Meanwhile, Jason informs Kevin that Rosie never returned from the flat viewing and he is concerned. Jason and Kevin hear Rosie's screams and find her bound and gagged in the flat and Kevin chases after John, who then crashes his car and dies. Jason apologises to Rosie for abandoning her and says he'll never do it again. Rosie gets an offer for a show in London however she has to be single to enter the show. She realises she has to follow her career and breaks up with Jason. Jason rekindles his relationship with Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) however she later shares a kiss with her gay best friend Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou), who is actually dating Aiden. They later fail to resist temptation and sleep together. The pair dump their boyfriends, Aiden and Jason. Realising they are in love, they agree to give their relationship a go. In December 2012, Jason starts a relationship with Stella Price, after repairing a water leak in the Rovers Return, yet she rekindles her relationship with Karl Munro (John Michie). However, Jason is convinced that Karl is responsible for starting the fire at the Rovers Return which killed Sunita Alahan. He tells Sunita's husband Dev Alahan and he initially ignores him. But, as clues build up, he begins to believe him. Just after Karl and Stella's wedding takes place, Dev locks himself in the newly built Rovers Return and he confesses to killing Dev's wife Sunita. Meanwhile, Jason is at the police station reporting Karl for murder. In the pub, Dev begins to punch Karl and he retaliates by smashing him around the head with a bottle. Stella enters through the back of the pub and finds Dev on the floor surrounded by shattered glass. Karl refuses to let her call an ambulance and locks her in the basement. The police come to the pub and Karl is arrested. Dev recovers quickly. Impressed by his concern for her mother Stella, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) shares a kiss with Jason in September 2013, and they later begin a serious relationship. In 2014, Tony (Terence Maynard) turns up at the Eileen's house, wanting to rekindle his relationship with Jason. He begins a relationship with Eileen's friend, Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard), and she is angry to discover that Tony is giving Liz more attention than he is his own son. Tony, still not convinced that he is a good enough father, decides to purchase the builder's yard from Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston- Davies), who is desperately trying to pay off his ¬£80,000 debt. When a ¬£75,000 deal is reached, Tony signs the builder's yard over to Jason, to say sorry for not watching him grow up. He also buys the flat next door, which he rents to Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) and Steph Britton (Tisha Merry). Tony begins to work at the builder's yard with Jason, taking on an executive role. They later employ Jason's friend, Gary Windass (Mikey North) and Zeedan Nazir (Qasim Akhtar), as labourers. After Jason's brother, Todd, returns to Weatherfield, Tony employs him, as a secretary at the builder's yard, but he puts the company at risk, after ordering cheap materials to make a loft conversion for Jason's friend, Tyrone. Matters turn worse when Tyrone falls through the roof, breaks his ribs and sues 'Jason's Construction'. When Jason discovers what Todd has done and that Jason and Gary knew what he was up to, he fires all three of them, leaving only Zeedan working at the builder's yard and, unable to live in the same house as Todd, for what he has done, Jason moves into the flat above the kebab shop with Eva. After realising that what happened to him was not Jason's fault, Tyrone decides to accept Tony's ¬£5,000 compensation and forgives Jason. When Todd is disowned by Eileen, he moves into a run-down flat, but he later gets a job at Barlow's Buys, impressing Eileen, who realises that he is trying to make amends, but Jason is not convinced. Eileen agrees to lunch with Todd, at 'Nick's Bistro', but when Jason talks her out of it, Todd realises that he has been stood up and heads home. As Todd walks home, he is attacked by a gang of youths and ends up in hospital, where he discovers that his face will be scared for life. Eileen and Jason, believing that Todd truly wants to change, forgive him and he moves back in with Eileen. However, Todd vows revenge on the pair, for not turning up to lunch at the bistro, as he thinks that they are the reason that he was attacked. As time passes, Eva plans for her and Jason to buy a house, but after Jason reveals that he cannot afford it, Eva asks Tony to lend them the deposit, to which he agrees. When Tony and Eva attend an auction at a hotel, Todd lets on to Jason that they are having an affair, to which Jason goes to the hotel and punches Tony and calls Eva a 'dirty slag'. When Jason realises that he has made a mistake and that Tony and Eva were actually planning on buying a house, to surprise him, Eva dumps Jason, for not trusting her. Although he pleads for her forgiveness and even proposes to her, Eva decides to leave for France, in order to think things through, but Jason is devastated, after discovering from her sister, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), that Eva is now happily engaged to a French man. In August 2015, Jason stands up for Sarah against Callum Logan (Sean Ward), but the result of this leads to Jason getting beaten up by Callum and two of his goons. Jason is left in a critical condition as a result, having to receive vital surgery on a clot on his brain. He regains consciousness a week later and tells Tony and the Police he thinks he heard Callum's voice. Jason spends 2 more weeks in hospital. In September, he gets Callum's home address from David Platt and hides in his flat. However, Denton arrives and demands money from Callum, but Jason's phone rings, causing them to find him. Jason punches Callum after Tony arrives to take him home. Eva returns in September 2015 and rekindles with Jason, however she becomes upset when Jason throws her out for feeling sorry for him. In 2016 Jason found out that his father Tony had died of a heart attack. Jason blamed Liz McDonald for Tony's death, which he said that if it was not for Liz Tony would not have left and that Tony could have been saved. In May 2016, after being rejected by Eva, he took Callum's friend Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) home with him. In the coming weeks, Callum's body is found. He is initially a suspect but is ruled out when they believe it was Tony. Gemma then tells him she knows it's not his fault but he should watch his back as his dad did it and people will take revenge on him. His van is then torched and he believes it is one of Callum's friends but it is actually his mother's partner Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) who is pretending that it's them to scare him and take his business. Phelan tells him he should leave to which he agrees and lets him 'look after' the business unknown that he is actually conning him even though Todd has figured him out. Before going, he goes to say goodbye to Sarah in a mental hospital where she has been committed because of being paranoid over Callum (unbeknown to Jason, she witnessed his murder at the hands of her sister-in- law, Kylie) and being diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. He goes back home and says an emotional farewell to Todd, Eileen and Sean before going to Thailand. Casting Ryan Thomas has portrayed Jason since he was seventeen. In late 2000, it was announced that two younger boys were to join the cast of Coronation Street. Ryan Thomas and Bruno Langley were cast in the roles of brothers Jason and Todd Grimshaw, the 17- and 15-year-old sons of Streetcars controller Eileen. Jason was originally going to be called James. The family moved into Liz and Jim McDonald's old house on the street. Producers hoped Thomas and Langley would achieve the same heartthrob status as Adam Rickitt, who played Nick Tilsley for two years before leaving to pursue a pop career. \\"We thought it was time for some good looking boys,\\" said a spokeswoman. DevelopmentFamily= The Grimshaws are often portrayed as arguing rivals in their scenes. Jason and his brother Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) are portrayed as \\"bickering brothers\\". Jason is often caring to their mother, Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Thomas told a reporter from Soaplife that he and Langley were best friends off-screen. On 15 November 2013, it was announced that Terrance Maynard had been cast as Jason's father Tony Stewart. Tony had been seen in the programme in 2003 played by Alan Igbon. Producer Stuart Blackburn told the official website: \\"Tony's arrival is going to cause massive ructions for the Grimshaws. He is a man who can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and with a long history of lies and betrayal, this is a guy who has an awful lot of making up to do.\\" =Relationships= In late 2005, Jason began dating Sarah Platt portrayed by Tina O'Brien, they had an on off relationship and were due to marry in 2006. Speaking of the storyline Thomas said: \\"Jason was thinking about getting married in four years rather than four months. It was just a gesture, and that‚Äôs all he wanted it to be. He thought they would just get engaged and they didn‚Äôt have to get married for ages yet. It was more of a stepping stone for him. It has come round quickly for Jason, and he is sort of being pushed into it. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose Sarah so he is going along with it because he does actually love her.\\" Asked if Jason would settle down Thomas also said: \\"He's had a bit of a past and he's a bit of a Jack The Lad around Charlie but on this occasion, for once, he's actually showing some grown-up qualities and, when faced with the prospect of losing Sarah, he chose to bite the bullet. There's no grey area with Jason because there's not that much grey matter! Everything's in black and white. It's either marry Sarah and keep her or don't marry Sarah and lose her forever.\\" Speaking about if Jason will also be able to handle Bethany, Thomas said: \\"He certainly will ‚Äì he pulls her to one side during the ceremony and makes her a pledge. He realises he can't have Sarah without Beth ‚Äì they come as a package.\\" The storyline resulted in Jason leaving Sarah and also resulted in Sarah leaving the street for a new life abroad with Beth. leaving Jason alone and upset. Jason had a relationship with Sarah Platt played by Tina O'Brien (pictured).In 2009, Jason began dating David Platt's ex-girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Speaking of the storyline, Thomas said \\"I just thought it was really good for their storylines because I knew it'd bring the Platts and the Grimshaws back together in their usual warring ways. Who could forget the famous fight on the cobbles between Gail and Eileen? I think at some point that'll come again. There's always banter from one side of the Street to the other.\\" Asked what attracts Tina to Jason, Thomas replied: \\"I think it's because she's quite full-on with Jason. She made a big effort with him in the beginning, so he just played off that and spiced up his life a bit in the process. He wanted a bit more fun than just sitting there having a pint in The Rovers every day.\\" It all came a little out of the blue, did not it? \\"Yeah, Jason completely wasn't aware that Tina fancied him. She had to come onto him to make him realise, but as soon as he got the sign, he was in there! It doesn't take him long to get his pants off! I think Jason was playing with the situation a bit as well to see what he could get out of her. When he started getting the right signals, he just thought 'I might as well have a go'. They seem to be very happy at the moment.\\" In 2010, Jason began a relationship with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan). Teasing the storyline, Thomas said \\"It's going to be a very feisty, sexy relationship between the two characters.\\" Asked if the Jason and Rosie pairing could work, Thomas admitted that with Jason's track record anything could happen. In October 2010, Flanagan commented on the storyline: \\"\\"Trust the writers to give it to me! I didn't have time to worry about it - or hit the gym! Ryan and I are like brother and sister so the first kiss was weird, but once we got that out of the way it was fine. \\"It wasn't as passionate as it looked as Ryan was in agony from an infected tooth. But I'm glad Rosie has got a boyfriend - it shows she has a heart.\\". In December that year Jason rescues Simon Barlow from No.13 after it caught fire after the Joinery exploded. In February 2012, Thomas said he wants \\"fun\\" times for Jason after the departure of Rosie. In an interview with Lorraine about what could be next for Jason, Thomas commented: \\"I know the direction it's going. I'm not allowed to say too much about it, but I know that they're putting me with [different] people and I don't know what's going to happen there. But that should be exciting for him. I just want Jason to have a bit of fun. He's been tied to that relationship and he always seems to get into relationships too quickly.\\" Thomas also added that he will miss Flanagan following her departure from the series. He added: \\"In real life, she is the funniest person ever. We will [miss her], yeah. Obviously a lot of people come and go over the years, but when you work so closely with someone‚Ä¶ She's a massive character and she will be missed. They've kept the door wide open for Helen. People like to spread their wings, go out there and see what the real world is about, because we're a big bubble in that show. We wish Helen all the best.\\" In 2012, Jason began a relationship with ex- girlfriend Maria Connor played by Samia Ghadie, Thomas praised the plot: \\"She was one of the first girls he ever went out with. I think he's just done a big round circle and come back. It's been great, I've enjoyed working on it. They've got all the right qualities to last as a couple but you just do not know. Couples do not seem to last too long on Corrie and if they do, there's always things that get in the way of relationships in soaps, so we'll wait and see\\". Ghadie revealed that filming the scenes with Thomas was more awkward than romantic as she and Thomas are good friends and revealed that it was like kissing her brother. On 26 June 2013, it was reported that Jason would have a new romance. Asked who Jason's ideal woman would be, Thomas told the Sunday Mirror: \\"I'd pick Deirdre. I love Annie [Kirkbride] and we have a right good laugh. I think that would be quite funny. Or Liz McDonald. I'm really pleased Bev [Callard] is coming back. That would cause problems for Steve and I'd love that, to be sat there with his mum on the couch.\\" It was later revealed that Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) would be Jason's new love interest despite Jason recently being in a sexual relationship with Eva's mother Stella (Michelle Collins). It was revealed that Stella would be livid that her daughter is dating her ex, but eventually calms down as she already has enough to worry about as her killer partner Karl Munro (John Michie) has left the street in dramatic circumstances. Speaking of the romance, Tyldesley said to ITV: \\"She's never really entertained the thought of anything serious with Jason in the past, obviously especially because he used to be with her mum. But she just begins to see that he's a really genuine, nice sweet guy. \\"Whilst Jason and Eva are trying to help Stella out, there is a little bit of flirting that starts, and Sean kindly points out to Eva how fit Jason is! She continued: \\"We can expect, as always, a lot more drama for the Prices. Obviously Jason used to be with Stella, so when Stella finds out that there's a little bit of cavorting going on between him and her daughter, things might blow up a little bit. God knows what Gloria's going to say!\\" =Departure= On 7 October 2015, it was announced that Thomas would be leaving the soap at the end of his contract. In a statement, Thomas explained: \\"It has been a great privilege to be in Coronation Street for the past 15 years. The cast and crew are amongst the best in the business and to have had the chance to be a part of it for so long has been an amazing experience. The decision to leave was an extremely difficult one but I felt that now was the right time to spread my wings and try other roles. I'm just excited now to see what exit storyline the writers give Jason.\\" Producer Stuart Blackburn said: \\"Ryan has been an important part of Coronation Street for 15 years. We wish him every success when he moves on next year and we appreciate his desire to try new things.\\" He departed from the show on 29 June 2016. Reception Thomas was nominated for the \\"Sexiest Male\\" accolade at the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2014 British Soap Awards.

The group was formed in 1981 by university students Yuenyong Opakul (Aed) and Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon (Keo or Khiao) who met while studying at Map√∫a Institute of Technology in the Philippines. The word carabao means \\"buffalo\\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience. They are known for their Phleng phuea chiwit (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏•‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ï) or 'songs for life'. This kind of music came to prominence through the protest songs of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band Caravan. Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of Thai music, western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like Latin music and reggae, earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'. (in German) MTV Asia calls them \\"veteran\\". Carabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter Aed Carabao is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2. History overview Carabao has a long and complex history, with multiple lineups and several members who have left and rejoined the band numerous times. Leader/guitarist/vocalist Aed is the only member who has participated in all their albums and tours, although most of their lineups have featured bassist Ot and guitarist Lek. Prehistory Carabao was originally formed in the Philippines with three members, Aed, Keo, and a third member named Khai, all of whom sang and played guitar. They stopped playing together when Aed returned to Thailand. However, Aed continued to play music and write songs, contributing a song to the popular songs for the Thai Muslim life band \\"Hammer,\\" and playing as a backing member of the band \\"Hope.\\" After the experience of playing with other bands, he decided that he wanted to revive Carabao so that he could have his own band. He persuaded Keo to return and switch to bass. The early albums Carabao released their first album, Lung Khii Maw (‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡πâ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏≤ - \\"The Drunken Old Man\\"), in 1981, with Aed and Khiao backed by a member of \\"Hope\\", as the fledgling band lacked a drummer, lead guitarist or keyboardist. This album featured a simple, primitive folky sound, not drastically different from other Songs for Life bands from that era, although it did feature a noticeable rock influence, something that earlier Songs for Life bands like Caravan and Hammer had lacked. Some of the melodies were borrowed from Asian or Thai folk or rock songs, with the title track based on a Filipino folk melody. The album did not sell many copies, but Aed set about recruiting other members so that the band could effectively perform live. A major breakthrough came with the recruitment of guitarist/vocalist Preecha Chanapai (Lek). Lek had a distinctive, powerful Santana-like style, and Aed has said that this gave him more confidence in the band. At the time, Lek was playing in a band called \\"The President Band\\", and on the band's 2nd album members of that band backed Aed, Lek and Keo, the latter who had by then switched back to guitar. The bass parts were played by President Band bassist Anupong Prathompatama (Ot), who has since gone on to be one of Carabao's longest running members. The resulting album had noticeably more rock-oriented arrangements as compared to their debut, and also had a great deal of influence of American roots music styles. Carabao first came into the national spotlight with their third album, Waniphok (‡∏ß‡∏ì‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏Å - \\"The Wandering Minstrel\\"), the title song of which told the story of a blind street musician and became a major hit. The song featured the distinctive \\"Samcha\\" rhythm, a kind of mix of Northeastern Thai folk rhythms like Mo Lam and Luk Thung with Latin beats. Future Carabao albums would feature many songs done in this style. Aed has noted with pride that before Waniphok was released, discos in Thailand played only Western songs, but the catchy indigenous rhythms of the song managed to break down those barriers. While no other songs on the album featured songs done in this style, it featured a strong influence of traditional Thai melodies. Like the second album, Wanipok featured Aed, Khiao and Lek backed by members of the President Band, including Ot on bass. By their 4th album, they had also added a permanent drummer, Amnaat Luukjan (Pao). At the same time, Aed invited Ot to become the band's official bassist, but since The President Band had plans to go on a US tour, he was unavailable. In his place, the band added Phairat Phoemchalat (Rat) on bass. The album also featured contributions from woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan), as well as backing vocals from Thierry (Ri), both of whom would soon become an official members of the band as well. The album continued to feature the folkier sound of their early albums, but also showcased their growing eclecticism. Stardom Carabao's most popular album, Made In Thailand (‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏ô‡∏î‡πå), was released in 1984 and sold over four million copies. The title track became a hit in several neighboring countries as well. The album featured a remarkable variety of musical styles, mixing rock, folk, regional Thai styles like Luk Thung and Mo Lam, some reggae and Latin beats, and even some classical Thai music with the song \\"Refugee.\\" By this time, woodwind player Thanit Siiklindii (Ajaan) had become a permanent member of the band, and guitarist/vocalist Thierry Mekwattana had joined as well. Meanwhile, Keo's role changed again, becoming a backing vocalist and live multi-instrumentalist. Before touring for 'Made in Thailand,' Rat left and Ot rejoined the band, this time as an official member. The resulting 7 member band, consisting of Aed, Keo, Lek, Ot, Pao, Ajaan and Thierry, is regarded by many fans as their classic lineup. This lineup recorded several more hit albums in the 1980s, resulting in a powerful, eclectic and increasingly political body of work, with hit songs like \\"Welcome to Thailand,\\" \\"Khon Jon Phuyingyai\\" \\"Mae Sai\\" and \\"Thaplang\\". The latter song was written about the theft of a holy Thai lintel, the Phra Narai, that later appeared in an American museum, and became the subject of Thai protests in order to regain the lintel. The song's chorus translates as \\"Take back Michael Jackson, give us back the Phra Narai!\\" During this period, Carabao consolidated their position as Thailand's most popular musical group of all time. In terms of musical style, the band remained extremely eclectic, mixing a wide range of Thai and international styles. Fragmentation After the \\"Thaplang\\" album in 1988, the band began to disintegrate, as members left to start solo careers. First to go were Thierry, Ajan, and Pao, who briefly formed a spinoff band. Reduced to 4 members, on their 10th album, Ham Jot Khwai (\\"‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¢\\") the band returned to playing with backing musicians, this time members of the Thai band 'Tawan.' After recording and touring for the album, Khiao became the next member of the classic lineup to leave, and the band announced a breakup. However, soon Aed, Lek and Ot were back playing together with some new backing musicians, including Luechai Ngamsom (Duk) on keyboards, vocals and trumpet and Chuchat Nuduang (Ko) on drums. Originally, this band was not called \\"Carabao,\\" but rather just 'Aed, Lek, Ot,' going by the remaining classic lineup members' nicknames. However, Aed was soon persuaded to revive the Carabao name, and the band continued with the new lineup. With Keo (Khiao) gone, Aed was now technically the band's only original member, although Lek and Ot had also been playing with the band almost from the start. After their 12th album, Satja 10 Prakan, Carabao fans got another shock with the departure of Lek, who was replaced by Kajonsak Hutawatthana (Mee) on guitar. Although many of the band's fans were unhappy with the band's lineup changes, this version of the band released 3 albums in the early-mid 1990s, with a lower degree of commercial success than before, but still remaining one of Thailand's most dominant bands, and with hit singles like \\"Raeng Koi\\" 'Yai Samang' and \\"Luang Phaw Khun\\" still getting major airplay on Thailand's radio stations. The new lineup soon added a 6th live member, percussionalist/backing vocalist, Sayaaphoon Singthoong (Nong), who would later become an official member of the band. During this period of time, the classic lineup of the band occasionally reunited for live shows. Reunion In 1995, the \\"classic\\" lineup of the band decided to reunite to celebrate the band's 15th anniversary. They recorded a double album, Hak Huajai Yang Rak Khwai (\\"‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡πÉ‡∏à‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¢\\" - \\"If You Still Love Buffaloes\\"), which became the band's biggest hit in years, and re-established them as Thailand's biggest band. However, the reunion did not last, and the Aed-Ot- Duk-Mi-Ko-Nong lineup resumed activities, this time with some production help from Keo. For their 18th album, Amerikan Anthaphaan, Lek, Thierry and Keo rejoined the band again. While Keo's return to the band did not last, Lek and Thierry continued as Carabao members. The result was a new lineup that combined 4 members of the \\"classic\\" band (Aed, Lek, Thierry and Ot) with 4 later members (Duk, Ko, Mee, and Nong), along with a new recruit, percussionalist/flutist/drummer named Thepajon Phanthuphongthai (Uan). The 25th anniversary Since then, the band has recorded several more albums, with another recent upsurge in critical and commercial success. They have now released a total of 28 official studio albums (Vol. 1 - Vol. 28 / 1981 - 2013), with some special albums, numerous live albums and compilations bringing the total to more than 60. The lineup has also remained stable, although percussionalist Nong left the band due to illness after their 25th albums, and later died. Additionally, classic-era members Keo (Khiao) and Ajaan have occasionally appeared on their post-millennium albums and live shows, though they have not been official members for years. 30th anniversary celebration and beyond In 2011, there were a series of 30th anniversary concerts all around Thailand and beyond, the biggest being ‚ÄúVelodrome Returns.‚Äù The band played nearly 50 songs during this concert, including a twenty-minute medley of 17 sam cha favorites, with time for only one or two verses of each song.(‚ÄúVelodrome Returns.‚Äù 2011. of Carabao 30th Anniversary Concert, DVD. Warner Music. Available at eThaiCD.com.) A Carabao convention, the Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21‚Äì27, that same year. During the day, convention goers viewed displays of Carabao memorabilia, attended music workshops, sang karaoke, and bought Carabao merchandise from the vendors. Each evening of the Expo, for seven nights, there was a Carabao concert on a different theme. (There are easily 500 Carabao songs, not counting Aed Carabao's solo work). Some band members said they had to look up and relearn many of the songs on the playlist, as they had never played them outside a studio. Keo, Ajaan, and others from the classic lineup were back for both Expo and the big 30th Anniversary concert.(Carabao New Year Expo (7 Days, 7 Themes), was held December 21‚Äì27. Available on DVD at eThaiCD.com) A 30th Anniversary album of new songs was released titled ‚ÄúGamlang Jai‚Äù (‚ÄúStrength of Spirit‚Äù or ‚ÄúMoral Support‚Äù), with the theme that the fans and the band provide each other strength of spirit and moral support. This album also included a DVD with music videos of some songs. (‚ÄúGamlang Jai‚Äù (‡∏Å‡∏≥‡∏•‡∏±‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏à). 2011. Carabao 30th Anniversary Album, CD/DVD set. Available at eThaiCD.com) All previous Carabao albums were rereleased for the 30th anniversary. Since then, Carabao has released one more album, 'Sawadii Phrathet Thai' (Hello Thailand) and has continued to play live with their long-running 8 man lineup, abetted at times with other classic-era members. Film, TV series, and other developments A Thai AirAsia Airbus A320 in a livery celebrating the band's 30th anniversary, seen here at Khon Kaen Airport in October 2013. In 2013 produced a movie ‚ÄúYoung Bao‚Äù (‚ÄòBao being short for ‚ÄúCarabao‚Äù) purporting to tell the origins of the band. (This was actually the second movie to tell this story, the first being ‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏•‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û ‚ÄúSiang Playng Heeng Seripaap‚Äù meaning \\"Music of Freedom\\" released in 1985, in which the band members played themselves.) In ‚ÄúYoung Bao,‚Äù most of the actors who played the Carabao band members as young people were themselves famous musicians. For instance, Thierry was played by both his own son Jessie Mekwatanna (for the teenager) and by Hugo (for the young adult).(‚ÄúYoung Bao.‚Äù 2013. Movie. Produced by Grand Big Bang. Available on DVD from eThaiCD.com) In 2013, the band members were able to fulfill their dream of playing with Santana, one of their biggest musical influences. Whether this did or did not go as hoped (both bands played Santana songs with no discussion beforehand and Aed was too starstruck to sing more than a few words), it did lead to the band's Santana-inspired 28th Official Carabao Album (28th in the official series of studio albums, not counting compilations, live albums, and special albums such the collaboration with Parn). The 28th Carabao album ‚ÄúSawadee Prathet Thai‚Äù (‚ÄúHello Thailand‚Äù) released November 2013 contains a song called ‚ÄúSantana Carabao‚Äù that is a 50/50 blend of the Santana and Carabao signature sounds.

Carabao songs are famous for their vivid themes and story- telling, with some song subjects, such as the blind street musician of ‚ÄúWanipok‚Äù and or the kind-hearted soldier ‚ÄúBua Loi‚Äù achieving mythical status. So each episode of ‚ÄúCarabao The Series‚Äù takes a different Carabao song and turns it into a 40-minute drama. While the dramas may deviate from the plot of the original lyrics, they stick closely to the spirit of the song. Three of the band members, Aed, Lek, and Thierry, introduce each drama by briefly discussing the song for the week, followed by the drama itself, then each episode concludes with a cover of the song by a younger band.

This battle was unique as it was fought 12 days before the official start of 1971 war. The battle started after an Indian army 14 Punjab battalion supported by PT-76 tanks from the 45 Cavalry and Mukti Bahini moved in to capture the areas around Garibpur inside the Pakistani territory. The next day, the Pakistani infantry battalion launched a counter attack. Ultimately, the Indian side merged victorious in this battle. Background After months of internal tensions in East Pakistan (current day Bangladesh) and a clampdown on Bengali nationalists, many independence fighters had organised themselves into a guerilla army. Called the Mukti Bahini, these rebels were aided by India in their struggle. After initial success by Pakistani troops against the Mukti Bahini there had been some relative calm in the region and further Indian assistance was sought to turn the tide. India thus started to involve itself deeper into the conflict brewing in the east and stationed its troops near the border. The Boyra salient located inside the northwest part of East Pakistan consisting of Garibpur village was at an important crossroads for both nations. Its control was thus vital as it included a highway to Jessore from India. The battle On 21 November, the 14 Punjab Battalion supported by PT-76 tanks from 45 Cavalry and Mukti Bahini moved in to capture the areas around Garibpur inside the Pakistani territory. The move was supposed to be a surprise, but following a skirmish with patrol troops of both armies the previous day, Pakistan was alerted to this impending attack. Pakistan immediately retaliated with infantry sized battalion supported by 3rd Independent Armoured Squadron, equipped with M24 Chaffee light tanks. Retaining the Infantry and the Recoilless rifles in a defensive position, the Indian tanks were sent forward to ambush the oncoming Pakistani charge. In the next couple of hours, the Indian troops resisted the Pakistani attack who couldn't pinpoint the source of attacks due to poor visibility on account of fog. Undeterred, Pakistan tanks and infantry were thrown into an offensive against the Indian defensive positions. However, the attack was repulsed by the Indians and resulted in heavy casualties for both Pakistan and India. The Indian military had employed PT-76 tanks which were superior than M24 Chaffee tanks. 8 Chaffe tanks belonging to Pakistan army were destroyed and 3 were captured.The Battle of Garibpur: Veterans Recall The Prelude to 1971 War Indian troops and Mukti Bahini also suffered heavy casualties during the battle. An Indian Army tank led by Colonel TS Sidhu was destroyed by the enemy fire and he was severely injured. Major Daljit Singh Narang was also killed in this battle. He was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest military honour. =Battle of Boyra= Pakistan Army had called for help from the Pakistan Air Force which soon responded with attacks on Indian positions. At around 3:00 p.m. three F-86 Sabres of the PAF flew in to provide close air support and hit the Indian positions using machine guns and rocket fire. The Indian Air Force however was prepared for such an attack and was thrust to neutralise the threat from the skies. Flying in their Mig-21s the four pilots were soon engaged in a dog fight against their Pakistani counterparts. Two Sabres were shot down while another was damaged after a brief dog fight. The damaged F-86 Sabre managed to fly back home safely. Two of the pilots ejected safely but were captured by the Mukti Bahini and Indian troops and were taken to India as POWs. Aftermath The battle coming just weeks before the official start of the war had an unexpected turn of events. Victory in this and other battles like Battle of Hilli ensured that the Northern sector of East Pakistan was virtually in the hands of Mitro Bahini (an alliance of Indian Army and Mukti Bahini) before the war was declared. The morale of the Pakistanis dipped and following the mass defections of Bengalis, it was only a matter of time before they would face ultimate defeat.

They recount the life and adventures of Thowra, a magnificent pale brumby (Australian wild horse) stallion, and his descendants, and are set in the Snowy Mountains region of Australia. Characters Thowra: The Silver Brumby, Ghost Stallion. His cream coat, silvery mane and tail lead him to be hunted by man throughout his life. Bel Bel: Thowra's cream coloured mother (she looks like Thowra). She taught him all she knew of the high country and of the dangers of man. Yarraman: Thowra's handsome flaxen chestnut father. The greatest stallion of the High country mountains and king of the Cascade Brumbies. The Brolga: The rival grey stallion. After battling Yarraman as a young stallion, he defeats and kills him when he reaches his prime. In turn, when Thowra reaches maturity, he defeats The Brolga, leaving him alive, and becomes king of the Cascade brumbies. Boon Boon:The Brolga's daughter; joined Thowra's herd when she left her father's herd. She eventually became Thowra's mate. Golden: A palomino mare who, born with humans, is bought by the man pursuing Thowra. Thowra is intrigued by the stunning mare and shows her how to jump the fence of man. She lives with Thowra through the winter and into the summer. Through the winter Golden is carrying Thowra's foal. Although she lives in the wild, Golden lacked the confidence to give birth to Thowra's daughter without the help of man. Later, Thowra returns, bringing Golden and their foal, Kunama, to the Hidden Valley. Arrow: Thowra‚Äôs older half brother(sired also by Yarraman) He is described to have Yarraman‚Äôs flaxen chestnut colouring but his mother‚Äôs cruel attitude and pinched looking face. Storm : Thowra‚Äôs bay half brother, sired by Yarraman. Storm‚Äôs mother is Mirri Mirri : Storm‚Äôs mother, best friend to Bel Bel. She is described as a bay mare. Kunama : The first daughter of Thowra and Golden. It means snow. The Silver BrumbyBel Bel= An extremely wise, creamy mare, mother of Thowra and good friends with Mirri, Storm's mother. Bel Bel runs with the stallion Yarraman, and in some cases is entrusted to go ahead and guide. Bel Bel, like Thowra, is scared of people, although in her case because she had always been hunted for her unusual colouration. She showed her son Thowra the ways of the hunted life, passing all her wisdom to him, which in turn Thowra passed down to his mare, Boon Boon, his daughter, Kunama, and his grandson, Baringa. He also tried to pass it down to his son, Lightning, and one of his favorite mares, Golden. Bel Bel is often described as a 'lone wolf' and dies on her own on the Ramshead Range, after one final chase. Bel Bel was the lead mare of Yarraman's herd. She is described in The Silver Brumby's Daughter as an old creamy mare with dark points and great, wise eyes. This is a little puzzling, as at no other time are dark point mentioned. As such, she would be a buckskin or a dun. Thowra's colouration and progeny suggest that Bel Bel carried and passed on both dilute and dun genes to Thowra. * No.1 Unknown Foal * No.2 Unknown Foal * No.3 Unknown Foal * Thowra * No.5 Chestnut Foal =Thowra= Thowra is a creamy- silver stallion, son of the chestnut stallion Yarraman and the creamy mare Bel Bel. Being born in a storm, his dam named him after the Aboriginal word for 'wind' not only for the gale outside when he was born, but because she was worried he would have to be as fast as the wind to remain free from the tyranny of man. The majority of brumbies in the southern areas of Australia being black, bay, grey and yellow, the appearance of a cream horse causes quite a stir among wild herds and humans alike. Thowra is met with open hostility from other horses, stallions in particular, while the men of the mountains quickly become obsessed with trying to capture him for his rarity. To survive, Thowra is forced to become more cunning than both horse and man. Though he is mentioned in nearly every Silver Brumby book, Thowra is only a main character in The Silver Brumby (and Silver Brumby Whirlwind), where he wins Golden for his mate, defeats the powerful stallion The Brolga, wins Bon Bon as his mate, and becomes King of the Cascade Brumbies. However, there is always the ever-present threat of man, and at the end of the first novel, Thowra is forced to pull off a seemingly suicidal trick to stay free. There is some indication that he can shapeshift into a white hawk and a whirlwind. In the rest of the series, he is an ancestor of nearly all of the protagonists, and often helps them (and others) on their respective journeys. Colouring Due to the poetic license of the word ‚Äòsilver‚Äô used to describe Thowra and his offspring it has misled some fans into believing that they are a pale grey or white, despite the fact they are described as ‚Äòcream‚Äò or 'creamies' just as often. The reason why he is known as 'The Silver Brumby' is that during winter Thowra's cream coat is described as becoming much paler, and takes on an almost silver sheen. In combination with his silver mane and tail, Thowra's pale winter coat enables him to blend into the snowy landscape of his native mountains. Though there is often much debate over the actual colour of the horses starring in the Silver Brumby novels, Thowra is almost most certainly a very pale palomino, or \\"isabella.\\" The reference to him and his kin as being \\"creamies\\" as well as silver would help back this up. Isabella palominos can be extremely light and comparable to a true \\"cream\\" or off-white colour. In Australian horsemen's language, \\"creamy\\" is a word used to refer to a palomino of any of the mid to lighter shades of this dilution. The final clue is that a sire who is chestnut, combined with a palomino mother, is the perfect genetic recipe for palomino offspring since palomino is the presence of the cream gene over a chestnut base. Thowra would inherit the potential for chestnut from both his father and mother. And his mother would provide the one creme gene he would need to share her own colour. The fact that Yarraman is described as a light chestnut makes an \\"Isabella\\", (or pale palomino) foal even more likely. It could be argued that some of Thowra's own offspring with Golden (most certainly also a palomino) might be cremello (double-dilute creme and even more pale, with pink skin and blue eyes), but Thowra himself could only really be a palomino. Other genealogical evidence from the books suggests that Thowra and the other \\"creamies\\", including his dam Bel Bel, daughter Kunama, son Lightning, and grandson Baringa are also palominos, rather than cremello, which is the next most likely colouring. In 'The Silver Brumby', the special relationship between Thowra and his mother Bel Bel is due to their unusual shared colouring: Bel Bel's other foals by the chestnut stallion Yarraman are all chestnut. In the cartoon series and the movie released in the mid-1990s, the 'creamies' are represented as palominos, but earlier cover art shows the silver horses as greys (white) Original Cover Art. Despite the early representation of Thowra as a grey horse, there are several grey horses within the books, including Thowra's mate Boon Boon, and the grey stallion Cloud and his mate, which are considered as distinctly different in colour from the 'creamies'. The two mares which form the foundation for Baringa's herd in \\"Silver Brumby Kingdom\\", Dawn and Moon, are described as being a highly unusual colour which like the colour 'creamy' is distinguished from a grey horse, and is described simply as 'white'. These horses are likely to have been what is now called 'cremello' or possibly 'smoky cream', rather than 'dominant white', as they are both out of two grey parents (neither of their parents could, therefore, carry the dominant white gene). Their foals by the 'creamy' Baringa are described as 'creamies' ( a 50% likelihood of a mating between a palomino and a cremello horse). Though there are other ways for pure white foals to crop up, like a foal who is a grey, and 'greys out' early in life. Another possibility is maximum sabino or maximum tobiano. Thowra is described as siring only three foals which are creamy like himself, these being an unnamed creamy foal upon the grey mare Boon Boon (which may have greyed out over a few years), and the true creamies the filly Kunama and colt Lightning from the creamy mare Golden. Golden is described as being a 'creamy' like Thowra himself, yet is much more clearly identified as being a palomino by her name, indicating that she is probably a darker, more traditionally 'golden' coloured palomino, though clearly still identifiable as being the same colour as Thowra. In 'Silver Brumbies of the South', Thowra muses upon the fact that outside of these three foals, he had had no silver foals. Instead, 'he had got many creamies with dark points who rarely went free, for the men always hunted them, and he had got taffies, and some strangely handsome duns'. A 'creamy with dark points' would be a buckskin, whilst 'Taffy' is the Australian term for what is sometimes called 'chocolate silver', or a brown coat with pale silvery mane and tail. These foals might have inherited one copy of the cream dilution gene from their sire, and their base colour from their mothers but the unusual colours mentioned indicate that the 'silver' brumby carried other colour modifying genes in addition to the cream dilution gene, potentially including the silver dapple gene (which is dominant but is not expressed on chestnut-based coats and results in taffy), the bay gene, wild bay gene, seal brown gene (none of these three express on chestnut-based coats. They require at least one copy of the extension (black) gene to show) or the flaxen gene (a trait that is either recessive or polygenic which only expresses on chestnut-based coats. A flaxen palomino is indistinguishable from a non-flaxen palomino.) =Thowra's Herd= *Boon Boon (daughter of The Brolga; Thowra's love) *Golden *Kunama (but once fully grown, joined Tambo's Herd) *Koora *Cirrus *Yuri *Wingilla (born from Boon Boon) *unnamed black mare *2 unnamed grey mares (daughters of The Brolga) *unnamed chestnut daughter of Arrow *Arrow's black mare *creamy colt with dark points (firstborn of Boon Boon) *2 unnamed dun foals * Jillamatong 'Jilla' (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd) * Wanga (creamy with dark points, born in Thowra's Cascade Herd) * Yuri * Dilkara Many unnamed mares are also in his herd but are not mentioned in the story as they run separately with Storm's herd. =Silver Brumby's DaughterKunama= Thowra and Golden's daughter, Kunama, is a free-spirited and beautiful young filly, one of the first creamies begotten by Thowra. Her name means snow. As a two-year- old, she is shown to possess a depth of intuition that is not shared by Thowra, her sire. This is perhaps partially because mares, without the luxury of a stallion's great strength and with the responsibility of foals at foot, must possess even greater wisdom than even the stallions of their herds if they are to remain free and wild. Kunama, having been trained in bush craft by both Thowra and Boon Boon, is cautious and wary of men, but not even this caution is enough to keep her in Thowra's Hidden Valley when her interest is captured by a young, spirited black stallion with an unusual splash of white on his flank, named Tambo, who is the son of a chestnut racehorse and another racehorse 'Highland Lass.' In the wild excitement of running with another young horse, Kunama does not heed the warnings of the wiser bush animals, and runs in the mountains for far longer than she should, even returning to the Cascades with Tambo during the summer, despite it being 'a time a silver filly must remain hidden or fear capture.' Eventually, a boy and his father manage to capture the silver filly, with the intention of turning her into a stock horse, but Kunama's longing for her freedom only succeeds in turning her into what the stock men call a bad horse. Kunama is eventually given her freedom by the boy out of pity, and she makes her way back to the Hidden Valley, remaining there with Tambo. Kunama is full sister to Lighting and half-sister to Jillamatong and Wanga, both creamies but with dark freckles. She is dam to Baringa and an unnamed chestnut filly. =Silver Brumbies of the South-Silver Brumby KingdomBaringa= Nephew to Lightning and son of Kunama, Baringa is a true silver horse. Strong, swift and smart, he is truly Thowra's grandson. But when Thowra takes him to the southern lands he is only a yearling. When he adds the beautiful Dawn to his herd, life becomes even more dangerous. However, Baringa soon finds a secret canyon where he can keep his herd, and he learns how to fight just as well as his grandsire. Eventually, he becomes the Silver Stallion of Quambat Flat. Baringa's name means 'dawn' or 'light' in an Aboriginal language. Baringa's story is told in the books \\"Silver Brumbies of the South\\" and \\"Silver Brumby Kingdom.\\" Baringa is also known to have the most beautiful herd anyone has seen in the south. Baringa's Herd *Dawn: 'white and silver' filly *Moon: 'white and silver' filly *Yarolala: flaxen chestnut filly. Throwback to Yarraman. Daughter of Son Of Storm *Kalina: 'Cream and silver' colt. Baringa's first-born son. First foal of Dawn. Born during a great flood *An unnamed snow white filly foal by Moon *A blue roan filly, daughter of White-Face *A lazy pert round white mare who belonged to the black stallion previously, she thinks everything is a joke =Dawn= The first mare to join Baringa's herd, Lightning and Baringa first saw her dancing in a spiral of silver mist on Quambat Flat. Though Lightning tried many times to (unsuccessfully) win Dawn over, she decided to run with the more compassionate Baringa. In the events of Silver Brumby Kingdom, Dawn is separated from the herd by a terrible flood and Baringa goes to search for her, eventually finding her on a small island in the middle of a river. By this time she has borne Baringa's foal, whom they name Kalina. Of interest is the fact that, though Baringa already has a herd, it is heavily implied in Silver Brumby Kingdom that Dawn is the mare he loves most, even to the extent of leaving his herd to search for her. Dawn is Moon's half-sister, and the two seem to be great friends. =Moon= The second mare to join Baringa's herd; was called the 'hidden one'. She looks and has the same hoofprint as her half- sister Dawn. Moon originally followed The Ugly One. Her first foal was a snowy white filly. =Pert White Mare= One of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. She was originally owned by the black stallion, but when Thowra decided to steal her, she went along willingly, yet slowly. She is described as 'lazy' and 'round'. Often called \\"Pert\\" Thowra is embarrassed but enjoys her stubbornness and is often 'fun'. =Unnamed Blue Roan Mare= One of the mares Thowra brought for Baringa. When Thowra was looking for Baringa, she was the only one of her herd to tell him anything. =Kalina= Son of Dawn and Baringa, Kalina was born when Dawn was swept by the river onto a small island, and it took Baringa days to find her. Though Baringa originally wanted to name Kalina after the flood, Dawn believed that their foal shouldn't be called something so terrible, and they named him Kalina - \\"for the marvellous beauty of the frost on snow\\". He also sired Yuri's foal whilst they were searching for Thowra . =Koora= Thowra's mare whom he left to run with Baringa. Had a silver colt with pale roan ears, Dilkara. =Lightning= Son of Thowra and Golden and the full brother of Kunama. Lightning is one of the only three silver foals Thowra sires. After being hidden away in the Secret Valley for two years, he is taken south by Thowra, along with Baringa. Lightning is beautiful but arrogant and is said by Thowra to have been almost as difficult as Golden to train in the way of the bush. He is captivated by Dawn's beauty and constantly pursues her for his herd. However it appears that Goonda is the mare he loves the most. When the black stallion comes looking for his stolen mares and becomes captivated by Goonda, Lightning learnt one thing. He learnt that even the remembered beauty of Dawn meant nothing to him compared with his feeling for Goonda. Lightning finally concedes that he must not go after Baringa's mares when Baringa defeats the black stallion when he could not. Lightning's Herd *Goonda: Red roan filly *unnamed colt born to Goonda *2 unnamed grey mares *2 blue roan mares (Stolen from the black stallion and won by Baringa who gifts them to Lightning) *Yarolala: Chestnut flaxen filly (who later joins Baringa's herd) *3 unnamed roan mares (Stolen and taken back by the black) =Goonda= Goonda is a beautiful red(chestnut/sorrel) roan mare and the first mare to join Lightning's herd when they were both two years old. She is the daughter of Whiteface. Lightning won her after his first real fight against another grey colt. Her name means fire. She grows into a lovely mare with Thowra surprised at how beautiful she's become and the black stallion stopping in his tracks when he saw her. She adores Lightning and when she sees him fight for her as though possessed by the spirit of Thowra, knows that she will belong to Lightning forever. =Yarolala= A chestnut flaxen filly whose colouring is a throwback to the Yarraman line. She is a daughter of Son of Storm. Yarolala heeds Lightning's call with the intention of following Baringa but loses track of him as he melts into the bush before either she or Lightning realizes he's gone. She stays with Lightning's herd but spends most of her time wandering in search of Baringa who she considers to be 'the most beautiful horse in the mountains'. =Other books in the seriesMoon Filly(1968)= The colt Wurring is devoted to the beautiful orphan filly Ilinga. But as she grows older and even more lovely, other stallions will challenge Wurring for her, including a mean iron grey stallion. Will the pair be separated? =Ilinga= One of the two protagonists of Moon Filly, Illinga is a strangely beautiful mare who is desperately trying to find Wurring (and vice versa) despite the efforts of an evil iron-grey stallion. Colouring The description of Yuri's coat colour is strange since she is described as being both a dark chestnut, and as having a coat that \\"glows\\" at night by reflecting the moonlight. This calls to mind the metallic coats of Akhal-Teke's, though this unusual metallic or \\"satin\\" sheen can occur in any horse breed. Champagne horses are also noted for this unusual sheen, though the occurrence of the rather new champagne colour in brumbies seems highly unlikely. It is heavily suggested by Elyne Mitchell that the \\"moon horses\\" are a special breed that is very refined and beautiful beyond their colour alone. Was she inspired by the rare Akhal-Teke? Or perhaps by Arabians? (a known influence on wild brumbies along with their descendants the Thoroughbreds.) Only the author herself would truly know that. Yuri's sire Wurring also may carry this glowing metallic sheen since he is described as glowing like the sun itself. Another horse whose coat colour is under debate is Ilinga. Although for the most part described to be a very dark brown, she is later (as she matures) described to have silver hairs running through her hair. Those with a better knowledge of horse genetics argue that she is much more likely a silver dapple black, (a black base with the silver dilution gene which dilutes black pigment to a paler, almost cream colour at times) because she is described with 'the colour of moonlight running across her back,' and strands of silver in her hair. This would certainly tie in better to explain the connection with the moon because of the colour contrast, and throughout the novels the colour of the character has been significant. But since silver dapples are described in some of the brumby novels, it seems strange that the author would not describe them as such. Another possible fault in this theory is that she does not seem to have been born silver dapple black, but rather turned this colour as she matured. Silver dapple horses are often born a buff or cream colour and with their first shed reveal their adult coat. All this confusion over colour could simply be an over-analysis on the part of enthusiastic brumby book fans. Perhaps Elyne Mitchell herself, though clearly very knowledgeable about horses, was taking creative license in describing the colours of her horses, without giving any regard to how likely they were or the possible genetics.

However, the Constitutional Court banned the party in 1991, and Sargƒ±n and Yaƒücƒ± were banned from holding office in any other party. The case was taken up by the European Court of Human Rights, which found that the ban violated the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Before the Court officially banned the party, TBKP had held a legal congress (the first time-ever legal congress of communists in Turkey). In this congress, a resolution was adopted overwhelmingly calling on all its members to join a project to form a broader- based socialist party, the Socialist Unity Party (SBP), with other socialist groupings and individuals. In the following years, Socialist Unity Party itself turned into United Socialist Party with the participation of yet other leftist groups. And finally this party merged with the former Revolutionary Path (Devrimci Yol) cadres to form the Freedom and Solidarity Party (√ñDP).

Devoid of the usual \\"sweet science\\" cliches, the book roils with dark pessimism as the characters eke out a gritty existence. It is considered an underappreciated classic of early 1970s cinema. In their memoirs, producer Ray Stark and director John Huston both cited it as among their finest achievements. Gardner adapted his short story \\"Jesus Christ Has Returned to Earth and Appears Here Nightly\\" into the screenplay for the low-budget 1989 film Valentino Returns.

Jan Dirksz Both (between 1610 and 1618 - August 9, 1652) was a Dutch painter, draughtsman, and etcher, who made an important contribution to the development of Dutch Italianate landscape painting. Biography Both was born in Utrecht, and was the brother of Andries Both. According to Houbraken, the brothers first learned to paint from their father, who was a glass-painter or glazier there. Later Jan was a pupil of Abraham Bloemaert and still later the brothers traveled together to Rome via France. Jan & Andries Both biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Gerrit van Honthorst has also been suggested as a teacher. By 1638 Jan and his brother Andries were in Rome where Andries concentrated on genre works in the manner of Pieter van Laer, while Jan concentrated on landscapes in the manner of Claude Lorrain. In 1639 Jan collaborated with Herman van Swanevelt and Claude Lorrain on a project for the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. Certainly by 1646 Jan had returned to Utrecht, where he refined further his expansive, imaginary landscapes drenched with a Mediterranean golden light. In Landscape with Bandits Leading Prisoners (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) the sandy road makes a sweeping diagonal from the left. Touches of realism in the down-to- earth figures and detailed vegetation of the foreground contrast with the idyllic golden distance. Occasionally Both peoples his landscapes with religious or mythological figures as in Judgement of Paris (London, National Gallery) where the figures were painted by a fellow Utrecht artist, Cornelis van Poelenburch. Jan's brother Andries (c.1612‚Äì41), who specialised in peasant scenes, died in Venice as they were returning to Utrecht.

This class encompasses the latest generation of locomotives of the Deutsche Bahn. In the United States, the Bombardier ALP-46 is derived from the DB Class 101. The Bombardier Traxx shares a common heritage.  Background  regional train on the Nuremberg-Ingolstadt high-speed rail line Around 1990, it became apparent that the current electric locomotives serving the heavy and fast (speeds over ) Intercity services, the Class 103, were wearing out. Their annual mileage of up to , and the faster and heavier trains, for which these units had not been designed, meant increasing wear damage to the control units, traction motors, and bogie frames. In addition, as part of the Program DB 90, and to cut costs, the theory of \\"Drive to Deterioration\\" (Fahren auf Verschlei√ü) was employed, which increased the strain even further. Another class in similar service, the 60 units of the Class 120 three-phase locomotive, had also reached a stage where both their age and their design meant ever increasing technical problems. Finally, there were 89 locomotives of the former East German Class 112, capable of speeds up to , but these units were no longer up to date, and were going to require expenditures in terms of cost of upkeep similar to the existing other classes in this service. In addition, this class was something of a political step child, and the DB wished for a truly new design along the lines of the three-phase Class 120 locomotives. In the beginning of 1991, the DB first called for designs for new high-performance all-purpose locomotives, using the program name Class 121. Designs for an all-purpose three-phase locomotive with an output in excess of and top speeds of were offered, which turned out to be much too expensive for the DB. In addition, due to the separation of services into different areas of operation, suddenly an all-purpose locomotive was no longer required. In December 1991 a second, Europe-wide bidding process was initiated, allowing the bidding companies more room for their own ideas. Over 30 designs were offered, from below to over output, including powered head units (Triebkopf) and units with only one driver's cab (similar to the E464, in service today in Italy). The latter idea was not pursued by DB since it proved too inflexible in service trials, and the price difference turned out to be minimal. The non- German firms ≈†koda, Ansaldo and GEC-Alsthom were eliminated from the contest at an early stage, as the local construction methods and achievements of existing units did not find favour with the DB. On the other hand, German firms Siemens, AEG and Adtranz were able to shine with their modular locomotive designs which were customisable to the requirements of different customers and shared many common elements amongst each module. DB 101 017-2 Siemens and Krauss-Maffei already had a prototype of the EuroSprinter, class 127, in service, and AEG Schienenfahrzeugtechnik was able to very quickly present a working demonstration prototype of their concept 12X, the future 128001. ABB Henschel had no modern prototypes, but only a concept named Eco2000, and a technology demonstration based on two already 15-year-old rebuilt Class 120 locomotives. To develop the components for the Eco2001, ABB Henschel used two Class 120 prototype locomotives, 120 004 and 005, which had been converted by ABB in 1992, in order to test new technologies in service. 120 005 received new electric power converters based on GTO-Thyristors, as well as new on-board electronics. 120 004 additionally received flexi-float bogies adapted from ICE units with driving rods instead of pivot pins, disc brakes, and utilising a new biodegradable polyol-ester cooling agent for its main transformer. Both of these reconfigured locomotives covered large distances in regular IC service without disruption. To the surprise of many observers, in December 1994 DB signed a letter of intent with ABB Henschel which resulted in the order of 145 locomotives on 28 July 1995. The first class 101 locomotive was ceremonially presented on 1 July 1996. This unit, as was the case for the first three locomotives of this class, carried the orient red color scheme. ABB Henschel had by this time merged with AEG to become Adtranz, and some of the bodies were now being built at the Hennigsdorf factory, while others were built in Kassel. The bodies that were manufactured in Hennigsdorf were transported by flat bed trucks via the Autobahn to Kassel, where they were attached to the bogies built in Wroc≈Çaw in Poland, and assembly was finalized. On 19 February 1997, the first class 101 locomotive was officially put into service. Body Design 101 116 in Nuremberg, 20 August 2005 A Class 101 coupled to a coach The class 101 locomotives initially stand out due to an unusually large slope at the front and back. The body had to be both as aerodynamic as possible, and at the same time be as cost- effective as possible. For these reasons the designers passed on a front with multiple curved areas. Further tapering of the front was also rejected, as this would have meant increasing the distance between locomotive and coaches, in cases where the two were separate. This would have negated the advantage of a more pointed front, due to the air turbulence created in the space between the vehicles. In order to build support structures for the undercarriage, massive C-sections were welded together with steel plate of various strength in Hennigsdorf and in the Adtranz plant in Wroc≈Çaw. The buffers at either side of the front are designed to withstand pressures up to , while the front part under the top windows can handle pressure up . The front of the driver's cabs are made from thick steel plate. The front window panes can be utilised on either side of the locomotive, and are simply glued into the body without window frame. The roof of the driver's cab is part of the body, not the roof. The four doors on the sides lead directly into the driver's cabs and are made of light alloy. The side windows in the driver's cab in the class 101 featured swiveled windows, in order to avoid a window well, which often proved to be susceptible to corrosion (the windows in class 145 and 152 were continued to be counter-sunk). All windows and doors are completely pressurized by means of a special sealant section. The body side panels are 3 mm thick, and are carried by columnar sections, in between which parts of the cabling channels are laid. The side panels encompass the area from the back end of the driver's cabs up to the beginning of the sloped roof section, which is part of the removable roof sections. They end toward the top in a hollow section, which then takes on the roof sections. The side panels are connected together by two welded wicket/belt made up of steel plate. The roof is made of aluminum and is made up of three separate sections. The fan grills and roof slope area belong to the roof sections, and can be removed as part of the roof, making the entire width of the body available for work on the machinery inside. The roof sections are resting on the side panels, their connecting belts, and the fixed roofs of the driver's cabs, and a floating seal is built into the sections. The roof sections are completely flat for aerodynamic reasons, with the exception of the pantographs, the signal horns, and the antenna for radio communication. Since everything on the roof is mounted just a little under the top edge of the roof of the driver's cab, almost nothing catches any wind‚Äîeven a lowered pantograph is difficult to detect. In comparison to other German locomotives, the pantographs are mounted \\"the wrong way around\\"‚Äîthe hinges are pointing inwards. This is also for aerodynamic reasons‚Äîsince the pantograph rocker needs to be located above the center of the bogies, the pantographs would have protruded into the raised roof of the driver's cab. A special feature in class 101 units are the bogie side frame covers. They are mounted alongside the frame and cover the area down to the wheel bearings.  Bogies/trucks  Adtranz and Henschel aimed to develop bogies for the class 101 that would allow for the maximum possible latitude for future evolution. Therefore, the bogies were designed for top speeds of and are derived directly from the ICE design, even though the locomotives of class 101 were only capable of maximum speeds of . In addition, the bogies were designed to be able to support the wheel set of other gauges. It is also possible to install a radially adjustable axle, such as is in service in class 460 of the Swiss Federal Railways, but the DB elected to go without this option. Notwithstanding that the class 101 bogies are redeveloped from bogies on ICE trains, there are significant differences in their operation. The bogies of class 101 units make a compact impression, while the bogies on the ICE trains do not seem quite as compressed. The reason for this is that the bogies for the class 101 locomotives needed to be designed for both high speed stability and good performance in tight curves. This necessitated the use of a shorter wheelbase and large wheels. The bogies in the ICE trains did not need to take into account some of the tight curves that the class 101 trains need to handle. Specifically, the wheelbase was reduced from for the ICE to for the class 101 units. Using these compact bogies resulted in such a significant decrease in the relative movement between body and bogies, and it became possible to run the connecting cables to the motor outside of the ventilation ducts. This simplified the construction and resulted in a longer life cycle. The bogies consist of the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The transfer of pulling and braking power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via pivot pin to the bogie. The pivot pins are mounted with a slight slant to enable the formation of a right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about to the pivot pin, so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced. The hollow axles, made from a chrome-molybdenum alloy, carry the massive wheels and the wheel set bearings at each end. The wheels are the typical German size, , with a minimum of after wear. The axles are mounted via hollow shafts into the gearbox casing, which, together with the traction motor, are designated the \\"integrated common drive train\\", or IGA. Both the manufacturer and the DB were thereby hoping for greatly reduced maintenance costs, with its outstanding (and in 120 004 proven) oil leak tightness, which is also to the benefit of greater environmental protection. The power transmission to the axle and shaft takes place via a universal joint (also known as a Hooke's joint or Cardan joint) with rubber elements. The two wheels of each bogie are attached with six very large bolts, which are visible from the platform.  Brake system and traction motors  On the hollow shafts there are two ventilated disc brakes, for which there is enough room due to the missing cross beam and pivot pin, as mentioned above. The disc brakes are separate and are ventilated from the inside. They can be serviced or replaced from below, without needing to take out the entire axle. During regular braking, primarily the regenerative brake is used, and the traction motor serves as the generator. The cooperation between disc brakes and regenerative brakes is controlled by a dedicated brake control computer. Each wheel has its own brake cylinder, and each wheel set also features an additional brake cylinder for the spring brake, which operates as the hand brake/parking brake and can secure locomotive at up to 4 percent incline. The traction motors, which are designed to be without housing, can reach top speeds of at a maximum of 3,810 revolutions per minute; the gear ratio of 3.95 prevents revolutions over 4,000/min. Maximum output is ; the torque moves at . The traction motor blowers are controlled by built-in sensors, and are powered by an electrical auxiliary inverter. The cooling air is transported in a closed air duct, which keeps the engine room clean. This cooling air flows into the traction motor via flexible bellows, moves through the \\"integrated common drive train\\", and is exhausted via openings in the gear box. A maximum of of air are conveyed by each blower, of which is conveyed into the engine room. Each traction motor weighs , and the entire bogie weighs in at about . The entire traction drive is mounted on an assisting beam in the center of the bogie, and attached to the outer sides via two pendulums. It is possible to mount in the center, since the bogies do not have pivot pins; the bogie is propped up above the frame by eight flexicoil springs. The resulting freedom of movement in all directions is limited by hydraulic buffers and rubber elements. By utilising this flexicoil suspension, many components, which either wore out or had to be expensively maintained, were eliminated.  Compressed air system  The compressed air system in the class 101 is similar to the system found in other locomotives. Via air intake in the engine room, air is sucked through a filter, and is compressed by a screw-type compressor to a maximum of . The compressor is controlled by a pressure control device and automatically turns on at , then shuts off at . The compressed air is then conducted through an air conditioning unit and is stored in two main air reservoirs. The entire system is protected against excess pressure by two safety valves, which kick in at pressure. The compressor is also individually monitored, and shuts off at oil temperatures above . In cases where there is not enough air available at locomotive start-up, even though the system features an automatically operated shut-off valve at locomotive shut-down, it is possible to supply air to the pantographs and main switch with a battery- powered auxiliary compressor, up to a pressure of . The compressed air system supplies the following components: * brakes * sand distributor * flange oilers * wind screen washer system * train whistles ; Sand distribution system To increase the transfer of train and brake power from the wheels to the rails, the locomotive can disperse sand onto the rails. The sand is stored in eight containers, one per wheel, on the undercarriage. When activated by the driver, compressed air is sent through the sand metering system, and sand is blown through downspouts to the front of the forward wheels in the direction of travel. At temperatures lower than , this system is heated, and the sand is regularly mixed inside the containers. ; Flange oilers In order to conserve the wheel flange, a biodegradable fat/oil is automatically sprayed via compressed air into the channel between wheel flange and wheel surface of the front wheel, based on the current speed. ; Train whistles On the roof of the each driver's cab are two whistles, which produce warning sounds of 370 and 660 Hz. These whistles are activated via a pressure valve located on the floor of the cab near the driver's feet, or via pneumatic pushbuttons located around the driver's cab.  Pantographs  The two pantographs of type DSA 350 SEK (recognizable as half-pantographs, as opposed to the diamond-shaped full pantographs) were originally developed by Dornier, and built in Berlin- Hennigsdorf. Today, the firm Stemman-Technik GmbH in Sch√ºttdorf are manufacturing and distributing these units. They weigh . The pantographs are screw-mounted to the roof at three points. Pantograph 1 is connected directly through the roof to the main control switch in the engine room; pantograph 2 is connected via a cable splice running along the side wall of the engine room to the main switch. The contact shoes are outfitted with a monitoring system in case of contact shoe breakage. Inside of the contact shoe, which is made of graphite, runs an air channel, which is overpressurised. In case of breakage, the air escapes, causing the pantograph to automatically retract, preventing possible damage to the overhead contact wire. The pantographs are raised using compressed air, which is provided at 5 bar () to the lifting cylinder. Raising the pantograph takes 5 seconds, while retraction takes 4 seconds. The contact shoe pushes against the contact wire with adjustable pressure of between . The driver controls the pantograph via a push button on the driver's desk (Up, Down, and Down + Sanding for emergency cases are the settings). The choice of which pantograph to use can be left up to the locomotive by the driver, which would automatically use the back pantograph in the direction of travel, or, in double heading, where two locomotives are coupled, it would be the front pantograph on the front locomotive, and the back pantograph on the back locomotive. Otherwise the driver, using a switch located on the battery control table in driver's cab 1, may raise one or the other, or both together. This is primarily an advantage during shunting/switching operation, where otherwise the change from one driver's cab to the other would mean the automatic switching from one pantograph to the other. In cases where the pantograph is being switched, the unit that was in the down position is lifted first, and once it is successfully pushed up against the contact wire, the pantograph that was in service is lowered. The compressed air for the lifting and lowering of the pantograph, as well as for the contact shoe monitoring system, are supplied via two teflon-coated hoses on the roof, which have to withstand the 15,000 volts of contact wire voltage.  Transformer  In contrast to locomotives of other classes, the transformer in class 101 is hung underneath the floor of the engine room on the frame, which enabled a very clean and uncluttered configuration of the engine room. This also caused the design of the transformer to be quite different from previous locomotives. The tank is constructed of light weight steel, but needed to be rugged enough to withstand a minor derailment or other accident; hence, some areas were reinforced with stronger welded sections. The transformer features seven electric coils: * 4 coils for the supply of the power converters with 1,514 volts and 1.6 MVA * 2 coils for the supply of the trainlines (which supplies power to all carriages for heating and cooling and other power needs) and disturbance current filters with 1,000 volts and 600 kVA * 1 coil for the supply of the three auxiliary inverters with 315 volts and 180 kVA * 1 coil for the supply of the battery charger, driver's cab heater and air conditioner, and pressure protection, with 203 volts and 20 kVA The transformer is cooled by a cooling agent made of a polyol-ester mix, which is recirculated by two independent canned motor pumps; these pumps make the occurrence of leaks almost impossible. Each pump can be sealed off separately, and can therefore be easily replaced. In cases where one pump fails, the cooling agent remains in the transformer tank; the transformer is capable of providing power at 65% of full capacity with just one pump in operation.  Software and other control systems  Driver's cab on a DB class 101 The class 101 units feature the automatic drive and brake control system (AFB, or Automatische Fahr- und Bremssteuerung), which assists the driver and enables the best possible acceleration and braking under all possible conditions. The AFB can also keep the locomotive at a constant speed. Class 101 also was outfitted with the Superschlupfregelung (\\"super slip control\\"), which controls the maximum number of rotations of the wheels per minute, and can automatically limit the rotations in order to avoid damage to the wheel surface or switch on the sand. This enables the maximization of the functional grip between wheel and rail. This system requires very precise information on the current speed, which resulted in the installation of a radar system into the floor of the locomotive, which sends the required speed data to the computer system. It turned out that the radar was unnecessary, and that this control system functions well without the data provided by the radar. The locomotives also feature the ABB-developed computerized 16-bit control system MICAS S. The control, monitoring, and diagnosis of the vehicle is done by a bus system. This type of system meant a large reduction in the amount of wiring, especially as compared to the class 120; much of the wiring is accommodated in the side walls of the body. The central control unit (ZSG), which is at the core of the system, is present twice for redundancy. All data that is collected by the various on-board systems is sent to the ZSG for processing, and all commands that affect the vehicle are originated by the ZSG. The ZSG consists of 4 processors, which monitor the train controls and safety systems, including the dead man's system. The safety system also includes the PZB 90, which enforces the adherence to signals and other regulations (i.e. approach to a stop signal at high speed, violations of prescribed speed) and may stop the train via emergency braking if necessary. Yet another safety system is the LZB 80, which keeps the train in constant contact with a central control point, where all trains on a line are monitored for location and speed. In the locomotives 101 140 to 144 the European Train Control System (ETCS) is being tested, which serves similar functions are just described, but is meant to do so on a Europe-wide basis. Also included in the control systems is the electronic time table EBuLa, which assists in the tracking of scheduled times, speeds, temporary speed restrictions, and other irregularities on the line which is installed on every train of the DB AG. The diagnostic system DAVID was also further developed from the ICE version in class 101. This system enables the monitoring and diagnosis of failures, and delivers possible solutions in real time to the driver and the maintenance depot. In addition, maintenance times are shortened, since the maintenance area can prepare for issues already identified by querying the system at any time, as opposed to just at certain points in the network, as is the case for the ICE version of this system.  Deployment  A Class 101 hauling an InterCity train at speed. The original plan called for the class 101 to be based in one of the main intercity traffic hubs in Germany, namely Frankfurt. The locomotive changes made necessary there by its terminus-type station would allow for the ideal alignment of running schedules and maintenance work of these locomotives. It then turned out that, due to the ever-increasing number of ICE trains with control cars arriving in Frankfurt, the DB decision to only run push-pull-type trains into Frankfurt station, and the necessary high investment to create a new high-tech train depot at the station, this plan was reevaluated. At the same time, spare capacity was created at the well-regarded ICE depot in Hamburg-Eidelstedt, since the depot there was built to hold 14-center-carriage ICE trains, and only 12 center carriages were being used. This spare capacity would now be used for the maintenance of the class 101 units. During the first years in this depot, the manufacturer Adtranz, in order to fulfill their warranty obligations, housed a team of 15 employees in Hamburg-Eidelstedt. In 2002 there were still two Adtranz representatives present. Basing the class 101 locomotives in Hamburg still seemed more cost- efficient to the DB than the construction of a new depot somewhere else, even though it meant the hiring of new drivers in Hamburg for the sometimes complicated, but necessary shunting/switching work. The base at a relative \\"outpost\\" in the far north of Germany also created problems with the service scheduling of the units. Every 100,000 km, the class 101 locomotives are sent to Hamburg for their periodic maintenance check (Frist), where minor technical issues are addressed. This depot also features an underfloor lathe for the reprofiling of the tyres. The locomotives were sent to the main railway workshop (Ausbesserungswerk, or AW) in Nuremberg for major maintenance during the first years; because of capacity issues at this AW, they sometimes were sent to the manufacturer in Kassel instead. Currently, the AW in Dessau is responsible for the major maintenance work on class 101 units.

These blimps were powered by two Pratt & Whitney Wasp nine-cylinder radial air- cooled engines, each mounted on twin-strut outriggers, one per side of the control car that hung under the envelope. Before and during World War II, 134 K-class blimps were built, configured for patrol and anti-submarine warfare operations and were extensively used in the Navy‚Äôs anti-submarine efforts in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean areas. Development A color photo of an unknown K blimp The K-class blimp was a product of the austere times of the American depression. In 1937, K-2 was ordered from Goodyear as part of a contract that also bought the L-1, (Goodyear‚Äôs standard advertising and passenger blimp). K-2 was the production prototype for future K-class airship purchases. K-2 flew for the first time at Akron, Ohio on December 6, 1938 and was delivered to the Navy at NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey on December 16. The envelope capacity of the K-2‚Äî404,000 ft¬≥ (11,440 m¬≥)‚Äîwas the largest for any USN blimp up to that time. K-2 was flown extensively as a prototype, and continued to operate testing new equipment, techniques, and performing whatever tasks were needed, including combat patrols in World War II. On October 24, 1940, the Navy awarded a contract to Goodyear for six airships (K-3 through K-8) that were assigned the designation Goodyear ZNP-K. These blimps were designed for patrol and escort duties and were delivered to the Navy in late 1941 and early 1942. K-3 through K-8 had only minor modifications to K-2s design, the only major change was in engines from Pratt & Whitney R-1340-16s to Wright R-975-28s. The Wright engine/propeller combination proved excessively noisy and was replaced in later K-ships with slightly modified Pratt & Whitney engines. The K-3 cost $325,000.Crestview, Florida, \\"U. S. Navy Gets World's Largest Blimp\\", Okaloosa News-Journal, Friday 31 October 1941, Volume 27, Number 42, page 3. A series of orders for more K-class blimps followed. Twenty-one additional blimps (K-9 through K-30) were ordered on 14 October 1942. On 9 January 1943, 21 more blimps (K-31 through K-50) were ordered. The envelope size of K-9 through K-13 was increased to 416,000 ft¬≥ (11,780 m¬≥) and those delivered thereafter used an envelope of 425,000 ft¬≥ (12,035 m¬≥). The final contract for the K-class blimp were awarded in mid-1943 for 89 airships. Four blimps from this order were later canceled. The remaining deliveries were assigned numbers K-51 through K-136. But, the number K-136 was not assigned to a specific airship as the control car assigned for K-136 was used to replace the car for K-113. The original car for K-113 was destroyed in a fire. The US Navy's experiences with K-ships in tropical regions showed a need for a blimp with greater volume than the K-class to offset the loss of lift due to high ambient temperatures. Goodyear addressed these concerns with a follow-on design, the M-class blimp, which was 50% larger. Variants After World War II a number of K-class blimps were modified with more advanced electronics, radar, sonar systems and larger envelopes. These modified blimps were designated: ;ZNP-K :The original designation of the K-class blimps. Individual blimps were identified by a sequential suffix number, e.g. ZNP-K-2, ZNPK-8 etc. In everyday use only the K and numerical suffixes were used. Batches of blimps were built with sometimes major differences, but the designations remained in the ZNP-K range, until the later versions, listed below, emerged. ;ZPK :Revised designation of the ZNP-K series. ;ZP2K :A larger envelope with the volume increased to , sensors and other improvements re-designated ZSG-2. ;ZP3K :A larger envelope with the volume increased to , with systems and controls even more advanced than the ZP2Ks, re-designated ZSG-3. ;ZP4K :Delivered in 1953, retaining the envelope volume and length of , re-designated ZSG-4 in 1954. Operational history The K-ships were used for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Mediterranean Sea. All equipment was carried in a forty foot long control car. The installed communications and instrumentation equipment allowed night flying. The blimps were equipped with the ASG radar, that had a detection range of , sonobuoys, and magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment. The K-ships carried four depth bombs, two in a bomb bay and two externally, and were equipped with a machine gun in the forward part of the control car. An aircrew of 10 normally operated the K-ships, consisting of a command pilot, two co-pilots, a navigator/pilot, airship rigger, an ordnanceman, two mechanics, and two radiomen. On 1 June 1944, two K-class blimps of United States Navy (USN) Airship Patrol Squadron 14 (ZP-14) completed the first transatlantic crossing by non-rigid airships. K-123 and K-130 left South Weymouth, MA on 28 May 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to Lajes Field on Terceira Island in the Azores. The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to Craw Field in Port Lyautey (Kenitra), French Morocco. The first pair of K-ships were followed by K-109 & K-134 and K-112 & K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June 1944, respectively. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and B-24s) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Straits of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left Weeksville NAS in North Carolina and flew a southern transatlantic route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey where they arrived on 1 May 1945 as replacements for Blimp Squadron ZP-14.Kline, R. C. and Kubarych, S. J., Blimpron 14 Overseas, 1944, Naval Historical Center, Navy Yard, Washington, D. C. The ability of the K-ships to hover and operate at low altitudes and slow speeds resulted in detection of numerous enemy submarines as well as assisting in search and rescue missions. The K-ships had an endurance capability of over 24 hours which was an important factor in the employment of ASW tactics. The mooring system for the K-ship was a high triangular mooring mast that was capable of being towed by a tractor. For advance bases where moving the mooring mast was not needed, a conventional stick mast was used. A large ground crew was needed to land the blimps and moor them to the mast. During the war, one K-ship‚ÄîK-74‚Äîwas lost to enemy action when it was shot down by in the Straits of Florida on 18 July 1943. The crew was picked up eight hours later, except for one man who was attacked by a shark and drowned just before being rescued.Vaeth, J.

The K ship was named Puritan and was the largest ever Goodyear blimp, acquired from the Navy primarily to experiment with various illuminated running copy advertising signs attached to the side of the envelope.

The Navy wanted to know if the blimp could be among the aircraft to deliver its planned Lulu (W-34) nuclear depth charge.Hansen, Chuck, The Swords of Armageddon, 1995, Chuckelea Publications, Sunnyvale, California, Volume VII, page 456 Airship designations During the life of the K-class airship, the U.S. Navy used three different designation systems. From 1922 through World War II, the Navy used a four character designator. The K-class blimps were designated ZNP-K where the \\"Z\\" signified lighter-than-air; \\"N\\" denoted non-rigid; \\"P\\" denoted a patrol mission; and \\"K\\" denoted the type or class of airship. In April 1947, the General Board of the U.S. Navy modified the designation system for airships. The second character of the designator was dropped as the Board dropped the code for rigid airships so that the \\"N\\" for non-rigid was no longer needed. The designation for the K-class blimps then became ZPK. In April 1954, the designation system for lighter-than-air airships was further modified so that it conformed to the designation system for heavier-than-air aircraft. By this time the ZPK blimps had been retired from service and only the later version K-Class blimps were in service. Under the 1954 system the ZP2K blimp became the ZSG-2, the ZP3K became the ZSG-3, the ZP4K became the ZSG-4, and the ZP5K became the ZS2G-1. In new designation system, the \\"Z\\" signified lighter-than-air; the \\"S\\" was the type denoting an anti-submarine warfare mission; the numeral (i.e., \\"2\\") was the model; and the \\"G\\" was for Goodyear, the manufacturer's letter in the Navy's designation system. The final numeral denoted the series of the vehicle within the type/model. The US Navy ordered a new type of airship in 1951 for the Korean War. The new air ship was designated ZP4K (later called ZSG-4), which had a different design than WW2 K-type. The first ZP4K was delivered in June 1954. A total of 15 were built. In 1955 an update version a called the ZP5K (later called ZSSG-1) was delivered, a total of 15 were built. The ZP5K has an inverted ‚ÄúY‚Äù tail.globalsecurity.org Airshiphistory.navy.mil, XV.

It organizes the melodies in a number of different tonal spaces called dastgah. The traditional music of Iran is based on the radif, which is a collection of old melodies that have been handed down by the masters to the students through the generations. Over time, each master's own interpretation has shaped and added new melodies to this collection, which may bear the master's name. The preservation of these melodies greatly depended on each successive generation's memory and mastery, since the interpretive origin of this music was expressed only through the oral tradition. To learn and absorb the essence of the radif, many years of repetition and practice are required. A master of the radif must internalize it so completely to be able to perform any part of it at any given time. The radif contains several different dastgahs which are distinguished from each other by their relationship of note intervals and the form of the movement of the melodies within them. A dastgah portrays a specific sonic space. A dastgah may contain approximately from 10 to 30 (melodies). The principal of the dastgah specify the different scales within that dastgah. The note, upon which the is based and often is the center of the , is called the shahed. The shahed moves when we modulate between principal , and this movement creates a new sonic space. Rhythm in these melodies takes three different forms: symmetric, asymmetric (lang), and free form. The rhythm is greatly influenced by the rhythm and meter of the Persian poetry. The instrumental and vocal radif are different from the rhythmical point of view; however, their melodic structures are the same. The radifs for tar are one of the most famous radifs associated, with many old melodies collected that include 20-40 in each dastgah. The radifs of Mirza Hossein-Qoli and Mirza Abdollah are the oldest radifs which are still in use for many students who wish to carry on learning Persian music. It is very famous as it consisted of many melodies collected from that time and before. Many of the melodies were changed by Mirza Gholi and some kept same to the composer's desire, but the evidence is small to suggest melodies were changed or not, but due to Radif being passed down through oral tradition (not in notation) we cannot state whether melodies were changed as we cannot compare notations or audios, but due to the mutations in music through oral transfer it is obvious. One of the most notable Tar players and repertoire of Mirza Hossien Gholi's radif was Ostad Ali Akbar Shahnazi, who was the son of Mirza Hossien Gholi and was the first Tar player to record the long radif memorized by heart. His work is still used by many Masters and are now some directions which are followed by many Tar players. Of course, beginner-intermediate students will not be able to follow his works on audio due to the level which it was performed at, so not much will be understood, but a Tar Master can expect to use it and re-focus on what was forgotten in his teachings at lesson with students. This can minimize mutations and keep the radif in line. The radif of Mirza Abdollah was published in notation by Jean During in 1970s based on Nour Ali Boroumand who recorded the radif by heart. On the other hand, the radif of Mirza Hossein-Qoli was first published in notation by Dariush Pirniakan in 2001. Though the radif is not popular with many young students it still is the constitute and basis of Persian music. It can be related to Classical music of western music that is not much popular, but forms the basis of Western Music.

The title derives from the classical Roman literary genre \\"menippean satire\\" which included a mixture of prose and verse. The work was written during the Etats G√©n√©raux which were convened by Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne (leader of the Catholic League) in Paris (on February 10, 1593) in the hopes of electing himself to the French throne (replacing the pretender to the throne, the future Henry IV of France). The work was conceived by Pierre le Roy (canon of Rouen and chaplain to the cardinal of Bourbon) during discussions with friends (\\"fran√ßais en politique et gallicans en religion\\" or \\"French in politics and Gallicans in religion\\") in Paris at the home of Jacques Gillot (canon of the Sainte-Chapelle). The work was written by Nicolas Rapin, Jean Passerat and Florent Chrestien, and edited/revised by Pierre Pithou. The philosophy of the group around Pithou and Rapin and the Satire M√©nipp√©e is that of the \\"Politiques\\", moderate Catholics who privileged peace, conceived of a distinction between the State and Religion, and sought political accommodation with the Huguenots. By the end of the civil wars, the \\"politiques\\" were the favored target of attack of the Catholic League. The work includes several remarkable passages, including a description of a procession and all the forces of the League, the public orations of the Duke of Mayenne, of the legate of the Pope, and of the cardinals Pelv√© (attributed to Chrestien) and Aubray (attributed to Pithou). The writers paint the miseries of the nation and the blindness of their detractors, and they encourage an alliance of the people and the monarchy to save the nation. Notably, Diderot's Encyclop√©die praises the work for its \\"singularity\\" and notes its usefulness to Henry IV.

This spider spins a moderately large (can be about 20 cm long in diameter) and very tightly coiled web. The spiders themselves are small and can be found to be anywhere from 4.2 mm to 10.8 mm long (McCravy and Hessler 215-217). Its venom is not medically significant to humans, making it completely harmless. The M gracilis is unique in appearance due to its large spiky abdomen and black and white bodies. Certain spiders of this species can also display a yellow color on the sides of their bodies (Vanderhoff et al. 470). These spiders can be seen most active during the end of the summer and beginning of fall. The M. gracilis is diurnal and are rarely ever seen active at night (Magalhaes and Santos 14).  Habitat/Webs  M. gracilis can be found in Northern Argentina as well as Eastern and Northern parts of North America. These spiders tend to wander and rarely ever remain in the same web site for more than week. On average, they spend about 6‚Äì7 days on each web site. They are neotropical forest spiders and can be found more easily in hardwood forests that contain Oak and Hickory trees. They tend to like moisture; they are more easily found in woodland forests that are near a lagoon, pond, or other small bodies of water. One study even mentioned that these spiders were found in an area that tends to flood during their mating season (Bukowski and Christenson 308) When constructing webs, the inner orbs of their webs are changed every night; however, they may keep the outer layer of the web the same for multiple days. Physical characteristics The central portion of a web of a Micrathena gracilis Females are 8‚Äì10 mm long. They exhibit a bulbous abdomen with spines. Males exhibit a fair amount of sexual dimorphism. They tend to be a fraction of the size of the females. Also, they have fewer spines, a flatter abdomen, and a slightly lighter tone. Although males can produce silk, they mostly use it in the mating ritual. Spined micrathena view from underneath Life cycle Micrathena gracilis hatches in the spring, the image of an adult. After the summer's growth, the female lays eggs in a sack. These remain relatively dormant through the winter months. The general life span is one year in length.

Leybourne is adjacent to Larkfield and West Malling. Historically, the area was extensively quarried, leaving a number of flooded gravel pits. These have recently been developed into Leybourne Lakes Country Park, and a housing development. Several of the houses on the development feature in the Channel 4 TV Series Cape Wrath. Nearby New Hythe was also home (until 2004) of Meridian's newsroom and studio for the South East.  History of the church  Despite its small size, Leybourne Church has a long history. The church was built in Saxon times but the church building was changed greatly in 1874. The Leybourne history started when the ancestor of the Leybourne family came over with William the Conqueror from France. He was granted land by William I in Yorkshire and lived there with his family for a long time. His descendant, Sir Philip Libourne, decided to live in a village in Kent called Lillieburn. The names mixed to call the place Leybourne. He built Leybourne Castle and was the first baron of Leybourne; his new name was Sir Philip Baron de Leybourne. Two people who were quite important were barons of Leybourne. The first, the baron of Leybourne, Sir Roger de Leybourne great grandson of Philip, was good friends with Prince Edward (later to become Edward I). In 1270 he set off with Edward on a crusade to the Holy Land. On the way he was ill so was sent back; in France on the way to Leybourne he died. His heart was sent back to Leybourne and put in the left-hand side box of the niche; the one on the right is empty. Niche on the north side of the north aile, Leybourne Church, Kent The second is Sir William Baron de Leybourne, son of Sir Roger, who was the first Englishman to have the title admiral. On 25 October 1286 King Edward I and Queen Eleanor of Castille visited William at Leybourne Castle. They left two crowns as gifts, which hang above the wooden plaque about Sir William, which was unveiled in 1956 by Richard Talbot.Church of Ss. Peter & Paul, Leybourne In the church tower there used to be three bells, but now there is only one. It is because the tower collapsed in 1580; they then only restored two bells. Then in Friday 10 June 1966 a bolt of lightning hit the tower and it caught fire, then they decided only to have one bell. The tower was Norman, but in 1874, architect Sir Arthur Blomfeld encased it in an extra layer of wall. The Domesday Book says about Leybourne: > \\"Adam holds Leybourne of the bishop.

Amenities Leybourne has a primary school, pre Norman-conquest church, 13th-century castle (dating back to Norman times), hairdressers, shop, newsagent and general store, village hall, pub/restaurant (The Old Rectory) and a Brewers Fayre restaurant and motel. Leybourne and the neighbouring town of West Malling elect three councillors to Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council. It also has its own Parish Council. There are junior football teams aging from Under 6's to Under 18's and also a cricket club for adults and children on the school premises: Leybourne St Peter and St Paul Church of England Primary school (Voluntary aided). Nearby Leybourne Lakes Country Park offer fishing, scenic walking and cycle paths plus water sports such as windsurfing and scuba diving. Bypass In mid-2005 work was started on the Leybourne bypass. The bypass was opened late in October 2006, with the aim of reducing traffic coming off the motorway and through Leybourne along Castle Way. The need for the bypass is primarily because of vastly increased traffic resulting from the development of nearby Kings Hill. Leybourne Woods Leybourne Woods is a small area of wood & heathland set between the communities of Leybourne and West Malling in Kent. Used by local residents for dog walking, leisure walks, running, mountain bike & horse riding the woods also conceal an amazing amount of wildlife. A Facebook page @Leybournewoodswildlife has recently been set up for local residents to share photos and experiences of local wildlife in the surrounding area, it is then the hope that this will raise awareness of the woodland and encourage more local residents to use it and help to maintain the wildlife habitats that are already in place there and educate future generations.

The Court held the practice was constitutional using the reasoning established in McGowan v. Maryland. The Court maintained that the national motto has no purpose in a coercive power to aid religion - neither on the face of the legislation nor in its operative effect (its practical impact on society). The Court also cited the Supreme Court of the United States' decision of Walz v.

Persian music consists of a number of principal musical modal systems or ; in spite of 50 or more extant , theorists generally refer to a set of twelve principal ones. A is a melody type that a performer uses as the basis of an improvised piece.  Summary  Each consists of seven basic notes, plus several variable notes used for ornamentation and modulation. Each is a certain modal variety subject to a course of development () that is determined by the pre- established order of sequences, and revolves around 365 central nuclear melodies known as (each of these melodies being a ), which musicians come to know through experience and absorption. This process of centonization is personal, and it is a tradition of great subtlety and depth. The full collection of in all is referred to as the radif. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September - 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, radifs were officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.The Radif of Iranian music: Inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, UNESCO.Noruz and Iranian radifs registered on UNESCO list, Tehran Times, 1 October 2009, .Persian music, Nowruz make it into UN heritage list, Press TV, 1 October 2009, .Nowruz became international, in Persian, BBC Persian, Wednesday, 30 September 2009, . The system has been a major influence in the maqam system in the Arabic music, both of which are deeply rooted in the Sassanid Persia's melodies, which entered into the Islamic world following the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The system of twelve and has remained nearly the same as it was codified by the music masters of the nineteenth century, in particular M√ÆrzƒÅ AbdollƒÅh FarƒÅhƒÅni (1843‚Äì1918). No new or large has been devised since that codification. When in the modern times an ƒÅvƒÅz or a has been developed, it has almost always been through borrowings from the extant and , rather than through unqualified invention. From this remarkable stability one may infer that the system must have achieved \\"canonical\\" status in Iran.  Terminology  The term has often been compared to the musical mode in Western musicology, but this is inaccurate. A is usually the name of the initial mode of a piece, which the music returns to‚Äîand moreover, a identifies a group of modes grouped according to tradition. In short, a is both the collective title of a grouping of modes and the initial mode of each group. According to musicians themselves, the etymology of the term is associated with \\"the position () of the hand () [on the neck of the instrument]\\". The Persian term can be translated as \\"system\\", and is then \\"first and foremost a collection of discrete and heterogeneous elements organized into a hierarchy that is entirely coherent though nevertheless flexible.\\" In conventional classifications of Persian music, Ab≈´  øA·π≠ƒÅ, Da≈°tƒ´, Af≈°ƒÅrƒ´, and BayƒÅt-e Tork are considered sub-classes of ≈†ur . Likewise, BayƒÅt-e EsfahƒÅn is a sub-class of HomƒÅyun, reducing the number of principal to a total of seven. A sub-class in the conventional system is referred to as . = Distinguished pitches = Koron (quarter flat) sign. A is more than a set of notes, and one component of the additional structure making up each is which pitches are singled out for various musical functions. Examples include: * Finalis, so named because it usually functions as the goal or destination tone that melodic cadences end on when they have a conclusory feel. This is also sometimes referred to as \\"tonic\\" but some authors avoid that usage because \\"tonic\\" is associated with Western tonality. * ƒÄqƒÅz, meaning \\"beginning\\", the pitch on which an improvisation in a usually begins. In some it is different from the finalis while in others it is the same pitch. * Ist (\\"stop\\"), a pitch other than the finalis which often serves as the ending note for phrases other than final cadences. * ≈†ƒÅhed (\\"witness\\"), a particularly prominent pitch. * Moteqayyer (\\"changeable\\"), a variable note ‚Äì one that consistently appears as two distinct pitches, which can be used alternately in different contexts or at the performer's discretion.

Gameplay  Eureka! is a text adventure set in European history. It consists of five parts, each of which has to be loaded and played separately. The first four parts can be played in any order, but the fifth part can only be played after all the other parts have been completed. The parts are: # Prehistoric Europe: Set in a valley somewhere in the Jurassic period. You have to escape from the valley and avoid hungry dinosaurs. # Ancient Rome: Set in ancient Rome somewhere around the 1st or 2nd century BC. You have to escape from slavery and win a horse race at the Circus Maximus. # Arthurian Britain: Set in medieval Britain during King Arthur's time. You have to foil the evil Mordred's plans. # Wartime Germany: Set in Germany during World War II. You have to escape a prisoner of war camp back to your own country. # Modern Caribbean: Set in the Caribbean in the 1980s. You finally confront your nemesis in his island-based stronghold and have to stop him from conquering the world. At the start of Modern Caribbean, the game asks questions from each of the first four parts. You have to answer every question correctly to start the fifth part of the game. The plots in Eureka! are somewhat clich√©d and the parser is very simplistic, usually limited to one verb and one object per command. Some rooms in the game have pictures representing them and sometime small animations. Unusually for text adventures, Eureka! maintains RPG-style hit points for your character. These hit points are lowered when your character is injured or raised when he gets something to eat. If the hit points reach 0, your character dies. Another feature of the game, was the rooms that had a time limit, which meant the player had to act quickly to complete a task or to quickly exit the area. The main text adventure was also accompanied by \\"arcade game\\" versions of the five parts. These were very simple affairs, where your character ran around a Pac- Man-style maze avoiding enemies. Apart from the maze layout and the graphics, all five parts were pretty much identical. At the start of Arthurian Britain the wind blows a theme from Franz Liszt's Les Pr√©ludes.

CTLA4 is constitutively expressed in regulatory T cells but only upregulated in conventional T cells after activation ‚Äì a phenomenon which is particularly notable in cancers. It acts as an \\"off\\" switch when bound to CD80 or CD86 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The CTLA-4 protein is encoded by the Ctla4 gene in mice and the CTLA4 gene in humans.  History  CTLA-4 was first identified in 1991 as a second receptor for the T cell costimulation ligand B7 (Bashyam, 2007). In November 1995, the labs of Tak Wah Mak and Arlene H. Sharpe independently published their findings on the discovery of the function of CTLA-4 as a negative regulator of T-cell activation, by knocking out the gene in mice. Previous studies from several labs had used methods which could not definitively define the function of CTLA-4, and were contradictory.  Function  CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed by activated T cells and transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells. CTLA4 is homologous to the T-cell co-stimulatory protein, CD28, and both molecules bind to CD80 and CD86, also called B7-1 and B7-2 respectively, on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 binds CD80 and CD86 with greater affinity and avidity than CD28 thus enabling it to outcompete CD28 for its ligands. CTLA4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells, whereas CD28 transmits a stimulatory signal. CTLA4 is also found in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and contributes to their inhibitory function. T cell activation through the T cell receptor and CD28 leads to increased expression of CTLA-4. The mechanism by which CTLA-4 acts in T cells remains somewhat controversial. Biochemical evidence suggested that CTLA-4 recruits a phosphatase to the T cell receptor (TCR), thus attenuating the signal. This work remains unconfirmed in the literature since its first publication. More recent work has suggested that CTLA-4 may function in vivo by capturing and removing B7-1 and B7-2 from the membranes of antigen-presenting cells, thus making these unavailable for triggering of CD28. In addition to that, it has been found that dendritic cell (DC) - Treg interaction causes sequestration of Fascin-1, an actin-bundling protein essential for immunological synapse formation and skews Fascin-1‚Äìdependent actin polarization in antigen presenting DCs toward the Treg cell adhesion zone. Although it is reversible upon T regulatory cell disengagement, this sequestration of essential cytoskeletal components causes a lethargic state of DCs, leading to reduced T cell priming. This suggests Treg-mediated immune suppression is a multi-step process. In addition to CTLA-4 CD80/CD86 interaction, fascin-dependent polarization of the cytoskeleton towards DC-Treg immune synapse may play a pivotal role. CTLA-4 may also function via modulation of cell motility and/or signaling through PI3 kinase Early multiphoton microscopy studies observing T-cell motility in intact lymph nodes appeared to give evidence for the so-called ‚Äòreverse-stop signaling model‚Äô. In this model CTLA-4 reverses the TCR-induced ‚Äòstop signal‚Äô needed for firm contact between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). However, those studies compared CTLA-4 positive cells, which are predominantly regulatory cells and are at least partially activated, with CTLA-4 negative naive T cells. The disparity of these cells in multiple regards may explain some of these results. Other groups who have analyzed the effect of antibodies to CTLA-4 in vivo have concluded little or no effect upon motility in the context of anergic T-cells. Antibodies to CTLA-4 may exert additional effects when used in vivo, by binding and thereby depleting regulatory T cells.  Structure  The protein contains an extracellular V domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Alternate splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. The membrane-bound isoform functions as a homodimer interconnected by a disulfide bond, while the soluble isoform functions as a monomer. The intracellular domain is similar to that of CD28, in that it has no intrinsic catalytic activity and contains one YVKM motif able to bind PI3K, PP2A and SHP-2 and one proline-rich motif able to bind SH3 containing proteins. The first role of CTLA-4 in inhibiting T cell responses seem to be directly via SHP-2 and PP2A dephosphorylation of TCR-proximal signalling proteins such as CD3 and LAT. CTLA-4 can also affect signalling indirectly via competing with CD28 for CD80/86 binding. CTLA-4 can also bind PI3K, although the importance and results of this interaction are uncertain. Clinical significance Variants in this gene have been associated with Type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid-associated orbitopathy, primary biliary cirrhosis and other autoimmune diseases. Polymorphisms of the CTLA-4 gene are associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease and multiple sclerosis, though this association is often weak. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the splice variant sCTLA-4 is found to be aberrantly produced and found in the serum of patients with active SLE. =Germline haploinsufficiency= Germline haploinsufficiency of CTLA4 leads to CTLA4 deficiency or CHAI disease (CTLA4 haploinsufficiency with autoimmune infiltration), a rare genetic disorder of the immune system. This may cause a dysregulation of the immune system and may result in lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and may slightly increase one‚Äôs risk of lymphoma. CTLA4 mutations have first been described by a collaboration between the groups of Dr. Gulbu Uzel, Dr. Steven Holland, and Dr. Michael Lenardo from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Thomas Fleisher from the NIH Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health, and their collaborators in 2014. In the same year a collaboration between the groups of Dr. Bodo Grimbacher, Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi, Dr. Lucy Walker and Dr. David Sansom and their collaborators described a similar phenotype. CTLA4 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means a person only needs one abnormal gene from one parent. The one normal copy is not enough to compensate for the one abnormal copy. Dominant inheritance means most families with CTLA4 mutations have affected relatives in each generation on the side of the family with the mutation. Clinical and laboratory manifestations Symptomatic patients with CTLA4 mutations are characterized by an immune dysregulation syndrome including extensive T cell infiltration in a number of organs, including the gut, lungs, bone marrow, central nervous system, and kidneys. Most patients have diarrhea or enteropathy. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are also common, as is autoimmunity. The organs affected by autoimmunity vary but include thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, thyroiditis, type I diabetes, psoriasis, and arthritis. Respiratory infections are also common. Importantly, the clinical presentations and disease courses are variable with some individuals severely affected, whereas others show little manifestation of disease. This ‚Äúvariable expressivity,‚Äù even within the same family, can be striking and may be explained by differences in lifestyle, exposure to pathogens, treatment efficacy, or other genetic modifiers. This condition is described to have incomplete penetrance of disease. Penetrance is said to be incomplete when some individuals fail to express the trait and seem completely asymptomatic, even though they carry the allele. The penetrance is estimated to be about 60%. The clinical symptoms are caused by abnormalities of the immune system. Most patients develop reduced levels of at least one immunoglobulin isotype, and have low CTLA4 protein expression in T regulatory cells, hyperactivation of effector T cells, low switched memory B cells, and progressive loss of circulating B cells. Treatment Once a diagnosis is made, the treatment is based on an individual‚Äôs clinical condition and may include standard management for autoimmunity and immunoglobulin deficiencies. A recent study treated a Korean CHAI disease patient with CTLA4 mimetic, CTLA4-Ig (e.g.. abatacept) and was able to control immune activity and improve patient symptoms. Regular administration of abatacept improved the patient‚Äôs severe anemia and diarrhea (3L/day) and brought 3-year-long hospitalization to an end. =Agonists to reduce immune activity= The comparatively higher binding affinity of CTLA4 than CD28 has made it a potential therapy for autoimmune diseases. Fusion proteins of CTLA4 and antibodies (CTLA4-Ig) have been used in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis. The fusion protein CTLA4-Ig is commercially available as Orencia (abatacept). A second generation form of CTLA4-Ig known as belatacept was recently approved by the FDA based on favorable results from the randomized Phase III BENEFIT (Belatacept Evaluation of Nephroprotection and Efficacy as First Line Immunosuppression Trial) study. It was approved for renal transplantation in patients that are sensitized to Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV). =Antagonists to increase immune activity= Conversely, there is increasing interest in the possible therapeutic benefits of blocking CTLA4 (using antagonistic antibodies against CTLA such as ipilimumab (FDA approved for melanoma in 2011) as a means of inhibiting immune system tolerance to tumours and thereby providing a potentially useful immunotherapy strategy for patients with cancer. This therapy was the first approved immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Another (not yet approved) is tremelimumab. The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo \\"for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation\\".

The station is on the Reading to Taunton line south west of London Paddington and the Bristol to Weymouth line south of Bristol Temple Meads. The two routes share tracks between Westbury and Castle Cary stations and are both operated by Great Western Railway, which also manages the station. Description View from the West with the main line in the left foreground, and the Weymouth branch on the right The station has three platforms. The main station facilities are located on the London bound platform 1, as well as the main station building and ticket office which is staffed until the afternoon. Toilet facilities are available on the concourse too. In front of the building is a car park for 100 cars, a bus stop and a taxi rank. Platform 2 serves west bound services to Taunton, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance, whilst the shorter platform 3 can only be used by trains on the Bristol to Weymouth line. Immediately to the west of the station the Weymouth line diverges from the London to Penzance Line. Castle Cary station is the closest station to the site of the Glastonbury Festival, which is held near Pilton about 8 miles away. During the period of the festival additional trains are provided, and special buses are run from the station to the festival site. The station also serves events at the Royal Bath and West Showground, though these are not provided with extra trains. It is also the nearest mainline station to the city of Wells. The station was awarded the Small Station of the Year award in the National Rail Awards 2007. History Platform one buildings Castle Cary station was originally on the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, a railway that linked the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Chippenham with Weymouth. The line was authorised in 1845, was acquired by the GWR in 1850, reached Castle Cary on 1 September 1856, and was completed throughout in 1857. For the remainder of the 19th century, the GWR's principal route from London Paddington station to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance was an indirect one via Bristol Temple Meads (the so-called Great Way Round). However, in 1895 the GWR directors announced that new lines were to be constructed to enable trains to reach Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance in a shorter time. The first stages involved improvements to the Berks and Hants Extension Railway and the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Line which reduced the distance from London to Castle Cary by and provided double track throughout. This was followed by the construction of the Langport and Castle Cary Railway, which was opened from Castle Cary to the existing Bristol to Exeter line at Cogload Junction in 1906. This transformed Castle Cary from a station on a secondary north to south line, to one on a main east to west route. The route resulting from these improvements and extensions forms the current London to Penzance line. Services Class 165 unit arrives in with a Gloucester to Weymouth service The service on the London to Penzance line runs approximately every two hours, with 8 trains in each direction, although not all trains run as far as Penzance. The service on the Bristol to Weymouth line runs on a similar frequency, again with 8 trains in each direction. From 13 December 2015 South West Trains commenced operating a direct service from to and via and .

It was the Monday programme in the Watch with Mother cycle. Initially introduced by Patricia Driscoll, the programme encouraged children to make things; Driscoll's catch phrase was \\"Do you think you could do this? ‚Äì I am sure you could if you tried\\". She left the programme in 1957 to play the part of Maid Marian in the ITV series The Adventures of Robin Hood. Patricia Driscoll's episodes were repeated until 1963 and was replaced by a new series of episodes with Vera McKechnie. The programme ran until December 1965 and replaced in the Monday slot by Camberwick Green in January 1966.BBC Genome ‚Äì Picture Book The show's opening theme tune was Badinerie, the final movement of Johann Sebastian Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor. Each Monday, Driscoll or McKechnie would open the Picture Book at a relevant page. Sometimes it would be shown to the camera at a distance, making the pages' content often brief and obscure. Alternatively, the presenter would simply tell the children what the next item would be, sometimes with a still photograph as a continuity link. It was something different every week. The 1963 series featured Sausage, a puppet dachshund who could speak a few words and generally shared the presentation with Vera McKechnie. The 1987 VHS release by BBC Video featured an episode including Sausage the puppet dog, the Adventures of the Jolly Jack Tars (a group of sailors), making paper lanterns, growing mustard and cress, and a regular cartoon of a little girl called Bizzy Lizzy, who had a magic flower. The 'Bizzy Lizzy' inserts for Picture Book were narrated by Maria Bird, who also narrated Andy Pandy, The Woodentops and The Flowerpot Men. A further episode was included on a Watch with Mother 2 video released in 1989. The main feature involved the creation of hills and a valley using a sand tray, an item featured regularly in the programme. Both episodes were taken from the 1963 series, presented by Vera McKechnie.

The three OVA episodes are based on the first chapters of Volume 1 of the manga. It was also made into an adult video game for the NEC PC-9801 in 1992. The story takes place in a world modeled after (and evidently parodying) that of a generic role-playing video game. The title character is a catgirl slave named Pink, who belongs to a \\"hero\\" named Santa. They are accompanied by an axe- wielding barbarian warrior named Bobo and a female elf mage named (depending on translation) either Pias or Pierce. The series depicts their adventures, and sexual escapades, as they travel around the world embarking on various quests. The feel of the story is distinctly humorous: for example, it is revealed that Pink is a human woman who was transformed into a catgirl after donning the \\"Cursed Panties of Torajima.\\" Much of the humor is broad and goofy in nature, but is also good-natured in its portrayal of the main characters. The adventures/quests are not overwhelmingly imaginative in nature, with Pink frequently serving as a damsel in distress while the barbarian, hero and mage act out their roles true to the dynamics of role-playing games. As is typical of hentai, many of the damsel-in-distress scenes have a distinct sexual bondage element, as Pink is almost always bound nude and frequently sexually molested in various ways by her captors. The plotting and characterization are not simply devices to string the sex scenes together, but actually build a coherent story. Plot summary Episode 1: It begins with Pink being used as a lure to keep a lusty monster named Monster Mage Viken off guard in a cave. The group's mission is to destroy Viken and collect the cursed Sword of Triton that he guards. After they succeed, the group goes to the town of Tajif where Pink wants to shop and get some new clothes. The shopkeeper is angered by a \\"cat-slut\\" coming in his store and yells at her to get out. Pink runs back to the inn, crying from the shopkeeper's rude behavior. Santa follows her and comforts her (amongst other things) before they rest. That night, Santa goes out to hunt something to make Pink some clothing. Much to his dismay, the first thing he encounters turns out to be a helltiger. Bobo appears and helps him kill it, demonstrating he is always there for him. He gives Pink a dress made from the helltiger's fur the next morning, demonstrating how much he cares for her. As they leave the inn, the party is surrounded by Tajif's guards, and taken before the queen. There, they are accused for being responsible for some girls who have gone missing recently, as Santa and Bobo were both seen outside the night before. They state their innocence and agree to embark on a quest to rescue the missing girls. A new mission begins, as the party vows to rescue the missing girls, not knowing something very dangerous is going to be in their way. Luckily they find the girls, but also encounter the villain behind the kidnapping, a Slave Witch. Santa and the party fight hard to defeat her, but the Slave Witch has something up her sleeve‚Äîa doll that regenerates her energy. Pink manages to grab the doll before it began to recharge, and Santa kills the Slave Witch by using his sword on a large red orb, which happens to be its heart. The party is victorious and they rescue the captured girls. Santa hoped to receive his \\"suitable reward\\" by making love to the queen only to get smashed in the head by an angry Pink willing to keep Santa in line. Episode 2: Santa and the gang use Pink as bait to defeat a kusarimame, a green monster that looks like a pile of goopy slime. With Pierce's fire spell, the monster is destroyed and Santa gets a mid-level magic pearl worth a lot of Gorts. Pink pulls the cart from the forest where they fought the monster to the nearest town, where she slides down a hill and ends up ramming them all into a tree. In the process, Santa's purse (which holds the pearl) was lost. Upon arrival at the town of Gatashi, they decide to treat themselves to a fancy expensive dinner, except for Pink, who was fed cat food. When it comes time for the check, of course, Santa finds his wallet that held the Gorts and the pearl was gone. Pink is left as collateral and he goes to find some quick way to earn money. They then collect the \\"honey\\" of a Honeymoon Fairy (by dildo-ing the little fairy with a shroom), which is enough to buy Pink back. When they return to the shop, however, the owner, thinking they had skipped town, has already gone and sold Pink! She is going to be sacrificed to the evil Water Goddess Yuarisla of a nearby town. Yuarisla usually enters her sacrifices and takes their life, but she decides to \\"play\\" with Pink before devouring her. Just as she finishes, though, Santa arrives in the nick of time to fight Yuarisla in both mortal and giant crab form. It is a tough battle but Bobo and Santa finally deliver the final blows to destroy Yuarisla and her gargoyles and successfully rescues Pink. When Pink commented that Santa came to save her, he replied he only saved Pink so he wouldn't pay for sex when he can get if from Pink for free. Pink, infuriated with the remark, smashed Santa hard in the head. Episode 3: While walking through a forest, Santa and the others encounter a demon girl named Sina being raped by a rapewing, a giant bat-like monster. With Pierce \\"powering up\\" for a powerful spell with Bobo's help, they defeat the rapewing and Sina tells the crew that her family and friends are being held captive in a nearby cave filled with treasure. The adventure from that point on is a cross between a Dungeons & Dragons-style dungeon crawl and a Scooby-Doo-like haunted house. Santa ties a leash on Pink so she can lead the way (and get attacked first by any monsters). However, it was Santa that walks right into the first trap, taking Pink with him. Pierce & Bobo are attacked by Slave Knights, demonic armored warriors each with an innocent young girl at their core. Bobo & Pierce had no alternative but to kill the girls to end their suffering for being used as the cores for the Slave Knights. Meanwhile, Santa & Pink are captured and molested, respectively, by Nymphomania, The Slave Queen, a naga-esque female. Santa was held over a pit of snakes dangling from a rope. When Pink caught the rope, Nymphomania used a Dildo Cobra to dispose of Pink. Pierce & Bobo came to the rescue at the last second before Pink lost consciousness and Santa began to fall. Seeing Pink severely wounded, Santa became enraged uses a special Sword Dancer technique to obliterate the cowering Nymphomania. After Pink recovered, Santa & Co. rescue the kidnapped girls and find the treasure, but the dungeon collapses and the treasure was buried underneath. After returning Sina to her family, the adventurers wander off. Pink managed to save a jeweled necklace from the treasure horde before the dungeon was destroyed, which Santa chased after her so he can sell the necklace for a profit. Manga Dragon Pink's manga version presented some characters and events that were not animated then for the OVA. For example, it explained how Pink became a catgirl by putting on a cursed pair of panties the party finds in a chest after defeating a monster in typical run-of-the-mill RPG fashion. The anime however, seems to leave this information out and state she always was simply a lower- class cat girl. After volume 2, Bobo and Pierce retire and have a baby, while Santa and Pink suddenly disappear and meet new companions in their quest: the mysterious priest Maze and the cursed princess Delta Pubic III, who can change herself from a young girl to an attractive, naked and powerful woman while she is covered in blood. Surprisingly, the manga version eventually changes from a humor RPG hentai parody to a darker from the first volumes to the last. In \\"Dragon Pink: The Secret Power\\", Santa, Pink, Delta and Maze were travelling along and rescue a young girl named Anne and her little brother Maruchi from a Yin Monster. The party arrive at Anne and Maruchi's home town of Shioka, where the annual Knight's Festival takes place. Anne has developed a crush on Santa, which made Pink jealous. She is also a martial artist who can use a whip. The gang hears of a heralded hero known as Master Labia, who governs Shioka with a watchful eye and a cunning mind. In the shadows are demonic succubi sisters known as Gold and Silver, who seem to be focused on Pink. After Santa and his companions enter Labia's mansion, complete with a giant arena, Maze and Delta separate and run into one of Labia's servants who attacked them. After spitting blood on them, it triggers Delta's transformation. Without hesitation, the servant surrenders without incident. Returning to town, Anne gets separated from Santa and friends and found herself abducted by Silver. She brings Anne to Gold and the two of them torture her, and then inserts a Yin Fish into her body. When Maze and Delta formally meet Master Labia, they learn that he's a soulmancer, and his true form is of an angel. They also learn that the reason for creating the Knight's Festival is to lure Santa out in the hopes that Pink would be there, so that Pink would be the grand prize of the Festival. This was part of Labia's master plan to also lure out the Yin Monsters hiding in the shadows. At the Knight's Festival, Pink sits beside Master Labia as Gold and Silver watch from the safety of the rafters. Santa and Anne fight their way to the Grand Finals and face off against each other. Gold and Silver use this opportunity to activate the Yin Fish within Anne and mutating her into a sea creature known as the Slave Eel. Anne's conscience is still intact as she sees the horrible destruction caused by the Slave Eel. Labia's army was cut down by the Slave Eel while the monks try to contain and destroy the Yin Fish. Santa and his friends try to save Anne while she's still conscious, but Delta tells Santa that once someone is possessed by a Yin Monster, the only way is to kill the possessee. Labia tells Pink why all the Yin Monsters are after her, because she has a latent ability to purify them. Labia managed to wound the sisters and keep them at bay. Pink stood before the mutated Anne as she can only watch in horror as the Slave Eel impales Pink straight through her body. Whatever happens after that is unknown. Additional information *The character's names are rather obvious puns: Santa, being anything but a saint; \\"Pierce the Elf\\" lending itself to a waggish joke; Bobo being a Japanese term for wild and unruly hair (particularly pubic hair); and Pink can be taken as a reference to female genitalia. In the first manga volume, Itoyoko explained through a mini-comic how difficult it was to choose a name for the main character and how she was named Pink after a suggestion of his editor. *The demon girl Sina in episode three bears a striking resemblance to the main character Mink from Dragon Half. As it can be seen in the manga, Itoyoko, the author of the Dragon Pink manga, says \\"Thank you\\" to Dragon Half's author Ry≈´suke Mita for \\"lending\\" him the Mink character for that scene. *Music throughout the three episodes is borrowed from, and reused in, a variety of other Pink Pineapple releases. *In the first chapter of the manga and the OVA, it can be seen how a guy (Itoyoko himself) customized the party of his team like, for example, first Final Fantasy style. *The first pages of the fourth and last volume of the manga showed a guy inserting a supposed Dragon Pink game into a Super Famicom and loading a \\"saved game\\". * Pink herself has appeared as a cameo in other of Itoyoko's manga: \\"Shikan Byoutou\\" features Pink (as a normal human) as a homeless girl hired by a young and eccentric doctor as his live-in maid and reluctant test subject for some sex-based experiments. It's worth mentioning that even if her new \\"master\\" (and his huge butler) use her as a toy, Pink still stays there by her own will. \\"Alice in Slaveland\\" introduces Pink as a grinning, aggressive, leotard-clad version of Cheshire Cat. She kidnaps Alice and takes her for a sex party at the Mad Hatter's place, but after forcing the nubile Alice to drink a love potion, Pink and her gang discovers too late that they are no match for Alice's lust. (The aftermatch shows a stumbling Alice picking up her clothes and leaving, while the Mad Hatter and his friend the Rabbit are reduced to dried up husks. Pink lays naked on the ground, KO'ed and with a foaming mouth.) *Other series of Itoyoko included \\"Let's Kurumi\\" and \\"Dynamite Milk\\". *In the opening of episodes 2 and 3, the Japanese translation had Santa listed as \\"hero\\", Bobo was listed as \\"soldier\\" and Pierce was listed as \\"witch\\". Pink's outfits ranged from \\"bride\\", \\"priest\\" and \\"martial artist\\" before seeing her in a skimpy costume and deciding to make her \\"cat-slave\\". *Pink's stats are LV 1 VP 1, Santa's stats are LV 1 VP 15, Bobo's stats are LV 1 VP 20, and Pierce's stats are LV 1 XR 15. *Santa breaks the fourth wall explaining his party's missions to Sina in episode 3.

The reviewer calls it a pleasant show which provides plenty of good hentai sequences as well as some fun fantasy adventure moments.Mania review by Chris Beveridge October 12, 2002 *Homemade Mech gives it an 8/10 saying that the hentai has some charm to it.Homemade Mech review for Dragon Pink 28th Apr 2004  References External links * Category:1992 video games Category:1994 anime OVAs Category:Hentai anime and manga Category:Kitty Media Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:NEC PC-9801-only games Category:Pink Pineapple Category:Seinen manga ","title":"Dragon Pink"},{"id":"2731727","text":"Vulgar is a 2000 American exploitation film written and directed by Bryan Johnson and produced by Monica Hampton for Kevin Smith's View Askew Productions. It features multiple actors from the View Askewniverse. The film is the tale of the character Vulgar, a clown who appeared in the original View Askew Productions logo. Though not a Kevin Smith film, it stars several actors that were cast in other View Askew Productions, such as Brian O'Halloran as the lead character, Smith himself as a gay TV executive, Ethan Suplee as one of the antagonists, Jason Mewes as a car wash employee, and director Bryan Johnson in a supporting role as Syd. In 2016, Johnson announced plans to create a sequel to Vulgar. Plot Will Carlson is a 20-something loser who lives in a duplex house in a rundown neighborhood in New Jersey, where he ekes out a living as a birthday party clown in order to pay the rent for his abusive mother's nursing home and the rent on his rundown house. Despite the difficulties of the job, clowning is Will's one escape from the realities of his miserable existence: Will genuinely likes kids, and takes great joy from making them happy on their birthdays. Struggling to make ends meet, but not wanting to give up his dream job, Will comes up with the idea to be a \\"bachelor party clown.\\" Will's idea is that men throwing bachelor parties can hire him as well as a stripper; Will enters the room prior to the \\"real\\" entertainment, wearing clown makeup and lingerie, tricking the bachelor into thinking that there was a mix-up and a gay clown stripper has been sent in lieu of a female one. Will invents the persona of Vulgar the Clown (after his friend Syd tells him that the entire idea is \\"vulgar\\") and solicits himself in the want-ads. Before long, he is hired to appear at a bachelor party being held at a nearby motel. When Will arrives for the party -- wearing stockings, garters, clown makeup, and a trench-coat -- he is attacked and brutally beaten by a middle-aged man, Ed, and his sons Gino and Frankie. The three men then proceed to gang rape Will, taking turns videotaping the attack. The trio hold Will hostage in the motel room for an indeterminate amount of time, during which they subject him to a series of violent and humiliating sexual assaults. They also break a bottle over his head and drug him. A tearful Will goes home and spends the remainder of the night and part of the next morning crying while he washes himself clean in the bathtub. Will spends a considerable amount of time after the attack in a crippling depression, which nearly costs him his home. Eventually, Will fulfills a promise to appear as a clown at one of his past clients' children's party. When he gets to the party, Will discovers a hostage crisis is occurring; the father of one of the children, in the middle of divorce proceedings, has kidnapped his own daughter and is threatening to kill her. In a near-suicidal reaction, Will sneaks past the police barricade, breaks into the house, and subdues the father. News reporters capture some of the event on film, and before long the story makes national headlines. Will becomes known as \\"the hero clown;\\" the attention and outpouring of support breaks him out of his depression, and he is eventually given his own syndicated children's television show. The media coverage attracts the attention of Ed and his sons (who are still raping young men). They threaten Will with a copy of the tape of his being raped (edited to look like amateur porn) and begin to extort him. When Will tries to pay the men off, they attack him in a bathroom stall. Will finally strikes an agreement with the men wherein he will come to a motel room and \\"perform\\" for them, allowing himself to be taken advantage of again, and they will give him all of the copies of the tape; secretly, Will plans to ambush and murder them with the help of Syd. When the time comes, the gun jams and Will finds himself unable to kill his tormentors. Just as Ed and his sons move in to rape and murder Will, Ed's son Frankie accidentally shoots himself in the face. Then, a shootout ensues with a vagrant lowlife at the hotel, who robs Syd and then plots to do the same to the others. Both the man and Ed's other son (Gino) shoot each other to death. Ed panics, and Will chases him through the motel parking lot to a nearby deserted playground. As Will approaches him with gun- in-hand, Ed has a massive heart attack and dies. Will takes off as he hears police sirens coming. His conscience clear, Will retrieves the tape and goes on to live happily ever after, hosting his television show.

Latin Percussion, also known as LP, is a brand of percussion instruments, specializing in ethnic instruments and Latin percussion engineered and manufactured to withstand the rigors of use in a drum kit, orchestral percussion section, and similar applications. This re- engineering often involves not only greater and consistent durability, but also changes to the sound to enable the instrument to be played at a suitable volume without losing the distinctive \\"feel\\" of its sound. History LP was founded in New York City in 1964 by Martin Cohen, following his difficulty in obtaining instruments for his own use, partly because of restrictions then in place on imports of Cuban goods following the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Unable to buy congas, bongos and similar instruments of the quality he saw other performers using, he manufactured his own. After much trial and error he produced acceptable results, and found a ready market for such instruments. As the company expanded, it added imported lines to its catalog, and also became an exporter. Product line LP pioneered the use of many ethnic-based instruments for wider musical uses, and continues to be a leading innovator in this area. They are particularly known for their revolutionary plastic jam blocks, standard wood blocks, durable granite blocks which is a modern version of the age old temple blocks, claves, , congas, bongos, udu drums, tambourines, maracas, one shot shakers, vibraslaps, Afuche , g√ºiros, g√ºiras and agogo bells, and their cowbells and jam tambs which is a modified tambourine used in drum kits. Some of their discontinued china cymbals are now highly sought after. Their Drumset division, CP or Cosmic Percussion, and Ascend saw success in the 1980s and 90s producing mostly entry level instruments, and some intermediate to professional grade instruments in Taiwan.

The organisation states its aim as 'increasing enjoyment of and participation in science and technology-based subjects in Scottish schools' and operates mainly at Standard Grade level. It operates a travelling roadshow which visits schools in Scotland and the north of England, and organises special events such as at the Edinburgh International Science Festival. Its mode of operation as a travelling roadshow enables SCI-FUN to provide a science centre experience to pupils in remote areas of Scotland, such as the Highlands and Islands. SCI-FUN Roadshow The SCI-FUN Roadshow tours secondary schools around Scotland offering a combination of presentations and hands-on exhibits encompassing scientific subjects in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, maths, engineering and technology. The Roadshow is presented to S1 and S2 pupils (11-14 years old) with assistance from senior pupils studying sciences at Higher or Advanced Higher level. The 2010/11 Roadshow includes presentations focusing on the senses and research, along with a talk encouraging pupils to consider the study of science subjects at Standard Grade. Current research at the University of Edinburgh is also covered in collaboration with FUSION; information on research in stem cells, the Large Hadron Collider, the Highland midge and Carbon Capture and Storage technology is currently included. In previous years, talks have discussed Climate change, the chemistry of the stars and survival. There are around forty-five hands-on exhibits included in the Roadshow to allow pupils to have a go at a number of scientific experiments in a short time. SCI-FUN Primer SCI-FUN Primer states its aims as 'explaining to upper primary school children that science is something that is all around them' and is aimed at primary school pupils P6 and P7 (age 9-12). SCI-FUN Primer is based on the hands-on part of the main SCI-FUN Roadshow programme, with activities scaled down so it fits within a classroom environment. This may be hosted by an associated secondary school. SCI-FUN at Science FestivalsEdinburgh International Science Festival= SCI-FUN have a presence at the Edinburgh International Science Festival which is held every year in Edinburgh over the Easter holidays. Elements of the SCI-FUN Roadshow are incorporated into the Science Festival programme, including exhibits and presentations. In 2011, as previous years, SCI-FUN was at Adam House on Chambers Street. They also presented their Senses show for the general public. =Hebridean Science Festival 2011= SCI-FUN took part in the Hebridean Science Festival in 2011. The festival is run by ESTEEM (Engineering, Science, Technology, Employability, Enterprise, Mathematics), which is based in Stornaway and aims to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists and mathematicians from the Western Isles. SCI-FUN ran their usual Roadshow for Hebridean schools, as well as hosting an evening session and a drop-in session for the general public. Other guests at the Hebridean Science Festival include the Astronomer Royal for Scotland Professor John C Brown, Johnny Ball, the University of St Andrews, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Mr Boom and the Stornoway Astronomical Society. =Other Science Festivals= SCI-FUN has previous attended other Science Festivals around Scotland, including in Shetland and Orkney, and plan to attend more. FUSION FUSION (Focusing on University Science Interpretation and Outreach Needs) is the sister group of SCI-FUN that collaborates with research groups within the University to find ways to promote their science to a wider audience. FUSION projects also lead to new topical science materials and exhibits, some of which have already been incorporated within the SCI-FUN Roadshow. =CCS Interactive= A major project of FUSION has been to produce the CCS Interactive (Carbon Capture and Storage Interactive) exhibit, with funding from the EPSRC. The CCS Interactive is a working model of Carbon Capture and Storage and has been developed alongside the Schools of Engineering and GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh. The CCS Interactive can be used to demonstrate the process of Carbon Capture and Storage to school and public audiences. The CCS Interactive consists of a model of a fossil fuel burning power station with CO2 being introduced into the system using a gas cylinder. There are two carbon capture columns, filled with high surface area zeolites which CO2 adsorbs to. Directions of gas flow and CO2 content of gas emissions are indicated using LEDs, and water vapour is used to simulate the gas emissions from the power station. History of SCI-FUN SCI-FUN started out as FUNdamental Physics in the early 1990s. This was a small scale, volunteer-run show focusing on talks about the physical sciences. This was expanded and in 1999 became SCI-FUN in its current form, incorporating the hands-on exhibits about all the sciences and touring the whole of Scotland. A pilot project involved the hiring of equipment from the National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust in New Zealand. The Roadshow has evolved over time, increasing collaboration with researchers at the University of Edinburgh and responding to changes in the school curriculum. Previous SCI-FUN ProjectsPP4SS= Since 2004, Alan Walker from the Department of Physics at the University of Edinburgh has led the PP4SS (Particle Physics for Scottish Schools) project, funded by the PPARC. This is a workshop activity aimed at senior secondary school pupils which has been used at school visits, University functions, the Edinburgh International Science Festival and at Scottish Parliament events. The PP4SS team visited CERN as part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, along with Professor Peter Higgs who theorised the existence of the Higgs boson. =LERU= In 2005 and 2006, SCI-FUN organised and ran the University of Edinburgh's part of the Europe-wide LERU Kids' University programme. This programme aimed to allow secondary school pupils to experience the University environment at an early stage. =Work experience placements= Previously, SCI-FUN has taken on S5 and S6 pupils for work experience placements. One week work experience places were offered to pupils to either travel out to schools with the Roadshow, or to work in the office developing exhibits or shows. In the past, pupils have also been offered a chance to apply for a bursary from the Nuffield Foundation for a six-week placement to work on exhibits for PP4SS.

His musical research is based on electronic sounds that he mixes with ethnic instruments, classical orchestras, and vocals. Career After a classical training in piano, Rousseau tried multiple instruments (including bass guitar, drums, electric guitar, and percussions) and finally chose the keyboards. After completing his studies in electronics, he was hired by the Defense Nationale in 1978 to work on the final tests of the neutronic head, the detonator for the French atomic bomb. After two years of this work, he quit. In 1980, he met Francis Mandin, a young electronic music fan, who convinced him to become a partner in Music Land, a music store in Paris and a laboratory for future electronic instruments. In 1981, after working on the finalization of the first polyphonic sequencer (MDB Polysequencer), he met Jean Michel Jarre, who was looking for a musical programmer capable of manipulating this instrument for his China Tour, that would be seen by 60,000 people. Rousseau was able to reproduce on stage all the sequences that Jarre had taken months to record without having to use playback tapes. This experience marked a turn in his career. Returning to Paris, he continued to participate in the recording of the live album Concerts en Chine. Later that year, Rousseau met Greek musician Vangelis, who was recording The Friends of Mr Cairo at Studio Davout in Paris, and became friends with Jean-Philippe Rykiel. The following year, Rousseau was called back to London by Vangelis for the recording of the music score of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. He was responsible for programming all keyboards except the Yamaha CS-80. This was the start of a complementary work relationship that was to last over twenty years. Returning to Paris in 1984, he collaborated on Jean-Michel Jarre's Zoolook album, programming the Fairlight CMI sequences and playing other keyboards. The result was not immediately liked by Dreyfus Records. In 1987, not wanting to be involved in Jarre's Revolutions album, Rousseau created French recording Studio Mega, in association with Thierry Rogen. During the next four years, he recorded with many leading French artists of the time, including Myl√®ne Farmer, Jean-Louis Murat, Louis Bertignac, Indochine, and Kassav. In 1990, Jean Michel Jarre used Rousseau again to rewrite all the intros and sequences of the music for La D√©fense Concert. On stage, Rousseau's job was to synchronize the sequences and to reproduce live all the special effects characteristic of Jarre's music. This concert made it into the Guinness World Records as having the largest concert audience (2,500,000 people). The year after, Vangelis moved to Paris and recorded the album The City at Studio Mega, which took more than six months. Rousseau then followed the Greek composer to Holland for Eureka, the European community project initiated by Fran√ßois Mitterrand on the theme of Industry and Transport. This concert took place on the Rotterdam docks and was transmitted by satellite to many European countries. In 1992, Vangelis convinced Rousseau to leave Studio Mega in order to create Astron Studio in Neuilly. They consecutively recorded the music scores of La Peste by Luis Puenzo, Lunes de Fiel by Roman Polanski, and 1492: Conquest of Paradise by Ridley Scott. After Vangelis moved back to Greece, Rousseau traveled back and forth to Athens for the production of the shows Antigone (1993), La Nuit des Po√®tes (1994), and Tribute to El Greco (1995). Rousseau released another solo album, M√ñ, in 1994, which was inspired by Asian music and would open the way to ethno-lounge music. He continued on his solo career, releasing Spirit in the Woods (1995), dedicated to trees, then Abyss (1996), a concept that Rousseau refers to as \\"non music,\\" an experience realised with neurologists specialised in musicotherapy. In 1997, he released Woods, an electro-wood fusion with voices from forest people and tribal rhythms. In 1997, Rousseau rejoined Vangelis in Athens for the opening ceremony of the world championship of athletics. Meanwhile, Rousseau composed the soundtracks for 40 ethnozoological documentary films and released in 1999 the collection of five albums Terres de L√©gendes. Vangelis' project Mythodea initiated in 1993, was finally completed in 2001. Rousseau coordinated the electro-orchestral show starring Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle and performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra, directed by Blake Neely. This music was chosen by NASA for the 2001 mission \\"Mars Odyssey.\\" In 2002, Rousseau released Travels a musical Travelog, and in 2003, Recall an exclusive release by Nature et D√©couvertes. 2004 was marked by Oliver Stone's Alexander in which Vangelis composed the soundtrack and Rousseau participated as editor. This project lasted over a year. In 2005, Rousseau signed with Milan-Universal and came out with a new album, Tears. Since 2008, Frederick has worked as Head of Industrial Relations for IRCAM, the French music institute. In March 2017, he released the album Edge of Silence which contains a tribute to Vangelis, MR V. This was rapidly followed in May by the ambient album I.S.S. (Intimate Sound Scapes), also on the Spinnup label.

It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco, particularly the Haight-Ashbury district, during these years. San Francisco is a westward- looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'.Stanley, Bob 2013 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop. London: Faber and Faber. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \\"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\\"Vulliamy, Ed \\"Love and Haight\\". The Guardian / The Observer. 20 May 2007. Retrieved from Web October 1, 2013 The Bay-Area-based jazz critic and columnist Ralph J. Gleason had established the first journal (Jazz Information) devoted to jazz, in 1939. Gleason was open to new pathways. He admired San Francisco's new music scene in the mid-1960s, and wanted to draw attention to it. According to an announcer for a TV show that Gleason hosted: \\"In his syndicated newspaper column, Mr. Gleason has been the foremost interpreter of the sounds coming out of what he calls 'the Liverpool of the United States.' Mr. Gleason believes the San Francisco rock groups are making a serious contribution to musical history.\\" The first serious journal of rock music, Crawdaddy, had been founded in the eastern U.S. in 1966 by Paul Williams. However, Ralph Gleason, shortly after the Monterey Pop Festival, became one of the founders of what would become the nation's dominant rock-scene fan journal, Rolling Stone.  Characteristics  Jefferson Airplane's original personnelThe new sound, which melded many musical influences, was perhaps heralded in the live performances of the Jefferson Airplane (from 1965 on), who put out an LP record earlier than nearly all the other new bands (August 1966). According to writer Douglas Brinkley, celebrated author Hunter S. Thompson, one of the Bay Area cultural- scene boosters, was a big early fan of the group: \\"Thompson extolled the sonic energy of the Jefferson Airplane as it pulsed around the California locales that nursed the psychedelic era...\\"Brinkley, Douglas 1999 \\"Introduction\\" in Hunter S. Thompson's Hell's Angels, The Modern Library edition, New York: Random House. p. xi. The bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the \\"Beat Generation\\" style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting. Acoustic music had had an avid following far and wide, but it was \\"a fading world of traditional folk and Brechtian art songs.\\" O'Brien, Karen. 2001. Joni Mitchell: Shadows and Light. London: Virgin Books, pp.77-78 The entire tone of the new subculture was different. According to biography author Robert Greenfield, \\"Jon McIntire [manager of the Grateful Dead from the late sixties to the mid-eighties] points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of joy. The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold.\\" The Beats tended to be cagey, keeping their lives discreet (save for the few who published, in literary bursts, about their perceptions, enthusiasms, and activities); in a word, they generally ‚Äúkept cool.‚Äù The young hippies were far more numerous, less wary, and had scarcely any inclination to keep their lifestyles concealed. The new music was loud and community- connected: bands sometimes presented free concerts in Golden Gate Park and \\"happenings\\" at the city's several psychedelic clubs and ballrooms. The many bands that formed signalled a shift from one subculture to the next. Monterey, California is about 120 road miles south of San Francisco. At the June 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, Bay Area groups (Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Big Brother and The Holding Company) performed from the same stage as established and fast-rising musical groups and well-known individual artists from the U.S., the UK, and even India. Soon after, Ralph J. Gleason and Jann Wenner, based in San Francisco, established Rolling Stone magazine (first issue's date: November 1967). The Grateful Dead in December 1970 Each San Francisco band had its characteristic sound, but enough commonalities existed that there was a regional identity. By 1967, fresh and adventurous improvisation during live performance (which many heard as being epitomized by the Grateful Dead and by the \\"cross-talk\\" guitar work of Moby Grape) was one characteristic of the San Francisco sound. A louder, more prominent role for the electric bass‚Äîtypically with a melodic or semi-melodic approach, and using a plush, pervasive tone‚Äîwas another feature.Melhuish, Martin & Hall, Mark (1999) Wired for Sound: A Guitar Odyssey. Kingston, Ontario: Quarry Press. This questing bass quality has been wryly characterized as a \\"roving\\" (rather than the conventional \\"stay-at-home\\") style. In jazz it had been exuberantly pioneered by numerous musicians‚Äîand such bassists as Charles Mingus, Scott LaFaro, and Steve Swallow had taken it into very exploratory places. A musician who was a leading example of this, Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane (and the offshoot Hot Tuna) pioneered the approach, perhaps best represented on the album Bless Its Pointed Little Head. Phil Lesh, bassist with the Grateful Dead, furthered this sound. Lesh had developed his style on the foundation of having studied classical, brass-band, jazz, and modernist music on the violin and later the trumpet. Exploration of chordal progressions previously uncommon in rock & roll, and a freer and more powerful use of all instruments (drums and other percussion, electric guitars, keyboards, as well as the bass) went along with this \\"psychedelic-era\\" music. Brasses and reeds, such as trumpets and saxophones were rarely used, unlike in contemporary R&B; and soul bands and some of the white bands from the U.S. East Coast (e.g., Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago). Sly & the Family Stone, a San Francisco- based group that got its start in the late 1960s, was an exception, being a racially integrated hippie band with a hefty influence from soul music, hence making use of brass instrumentation. \\"Rock & roll\\" was the point of departure for the new music. But well known stars of rock & roll \\"were being called fifties primitives\\" by this time.Schickel, Richard (2011) Conversations with Scorsese New York: Alfred A. Knopf, pg. 78. This was the period when \\"rock\\" was differentiating itself from rock & roll, partly due to the upshot of the British Invasion.n.a. 2010 \\"Rock and Roll\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Among these British acts, according to music journalist Chris Smith, writing in his book on the most influential albums in American popular music, the Beatles inspired the emergence of the San Francisco psychedelic scene following their incorporation of folk rock on the 1965 album Rubber Soul, which reflected the reciprocal influences shared between the group and Bob Dylan. San Francisco historian Charles Perry recalled that in Haight-Ashbury, \\"You could party hop all night and hear nothing but Rubber Soul\\", and that \\"More than ever the Beatles were the soundtrack of the Haight-Ashbury, Berkeley and the whole circuit.\\" In San Francisco, musical influences came in from not only London, Liverpool and Manchester, but also included the bi-coastal American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, the Chicago electric blues scene, the soul music scenes in Detroit, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, jazz styles of various eras and regions. A number of key San Francisco rock musicians of the era cited John Coltrane and his circle of leading-edge jazz musicians as important influences. Members of Jefferson Airplane performing in June 1967 The journalist Ed Vulliamy wrote: \\"The Summer of Love had an empress, and her name was Janis Joplin.\\"Vulliamy, Ed \\"Love and Haight\\". The Guardian / The Observer. 20 May 2007. Retrieved from Web October 1, 2013 Women, in a few cases, enjoyed an equal status with men as stars in the San Francisco rock scene‚Äîbut these few instances signaled a shift that has continued in the U.S. music scene. Both Grace Slick (singing with Jefferson Airplane) and Joplin (singing initially with Big Brother & the Holding Company) gained a substantial following locally and, before long, across the country. Another woman singer (and songwriter), Stevie Nicks, as a child had recurrently moved in the U.S. with her family. Coming of age in the San Francisco Bay Area, she gained her first performing experience there in the '60s with Lindsey Buckingham's rock band. Eventually both Nicks and Buckingham achieved international exposure and acclaim once their California talents were absorbed into the established British rock band Fleetwood Mac in 1975. Venues Performances of an international super group like the Beatles were hosted in a huge venue like the Cow Palace. At first, the local Bay Area bands played in smaller ones. The early band venues, while the new SF scene was emerging from folk and folk-rock beginnings, were often places like the Matrix nightclub. As audiences grew, and audience dancing became customary, performances moved into venues with more floor space, such as the Longshoreman's Hall, the Fillmore Auditorium, the Avalon Ballroom, Winterland, and the Carousel Ballroom (which was later renamed Fillmore West). Outdoor performances, often organized by the band members themselves and their friends, also played their part. Because San Francisco had an especially vibrant and attractive countercultural scene in the latter half of the 1960s, musicians from elsewhere (along with the famous hip multitude) came there. Some stayed and became part of the scene. Examples include the Sir Douglas Quintet, whose music took on more of the character of the San Francisco sound, while yet retaining some of its original Texas flavor, Mother Earth, fronted by female lead singer Tracy Nelson, who relocated to the Bay Area from Nashville, and the Electric Flag, bringing Chicago blues to the Bay Area care of former Paul Butterfield Blues Band guitarist Mike Bloomfield. Steve Miller (who formed the Steve Miller Band) was from Wisconsin, by way of Chicago and New York City while bandmate Boz Scaggs originally called Texas home. AM and FM radio The San Francisco bands' music was everything that AM-radio pop music wasn't. Their performances contrasted with the \\"standard three-minute track\\" that had become a clich√© of the pop-music industry, due to the requirements of AM radio, to the sound capacity of the 45 RPM record, and to the limited potentials of many pop songs and song treatments. It is true that many of the San Francisco bands did record \\"three-minute\\" tracks when they desired pop-music station airplay for a song. But in live performance, the bands would often share their improvisatory zest by playing a given song or sequence for as long as five or six minutes, and occasionally for as long as half an hour. In early 1967, Tom Donahue‚Äìa veteran disc jockey, rock concert producer, songwriter, and music-act manager‚Äìwas inspired to revive a moribund radio station, KMPX, and inaugurate the first FM-radio rock station, in San Francisco, in order to showcase this type of music. Donahue was uniquely qualified, being savvy and enthusiastic about jazz, R&B;, Soul, and ethnic music, besides the then-current rock music.Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh 1967 Interview, Youtube An important departure in this new era of \\"album oriented radio\\" (AOR) was that show hosts felt free to play lengthy tracks or two or more tracks at a stretch from a good record album.

It is located in a residential area uphill from the town centre and is by far the smaller of the town's two stations.  History  The station opened in 1894. Originally built with an island platform in a cutting, the Up platform was taken out of use in 1968 although the station building remained in use for another few years. Until the 1960s, the station was served by a local shuttle service between Craigendoran and in addition to main line trains to Fort William and Mallaig. Latterly operated by a Wickham diesel railbus, it fell victim to the Beeching Axe in 1964.\\"The 'Wee Arrochar'\\" Helensburgh Heritage Trust website; Retrieved 27 April 2016 right  Location  It is located on the West Highland Line, north west of and is served by services to and /.

Signalling  The original (1894) signal box at Helensburgh Upper was replaced on 21 December 1941. That signal box closed on 21 July 1968, when the crossing loop was removed. On 27 March 1988, Helensburgh Upper became the southern extremity of the Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling on the West Highland Line. A two-aspect colour light signal installed at the east end of the platform controls entry into the signal box (since superseded by Yoker IECC) Track Circuit Block signalling area.

The MTL uses template programming, which considerably reduces the code length. All matrices and vectors are available in all classical numerical formats: \`float\`, \`double\`, \`complex\` or \`complex\`. Furthermore, generic programming allows the usage of arbitrary types as long as they provide the necessary operations. For instance one can use arbitrary integer formats (e.g. \`unsigned short\`), types for interval arithmetic (e.g. boost::interval) from the Boost C++ Libraries, quaternions (e.g. boost::quaternion), types of higher precision (e.g. GNU Multi-Precision Library) and appropriate user-defined types. The MTL supports several implementations of dense matrices and sparse matrices. MTL2 has been developed by Jeremy Siek and Andrew Lumsdaine.J.G. Siek and A. Lumsdaine: The Matrix Template Library: A Generic Programming Approach to High Performance Numerical Linear Algebra. ISCOPE 1998. The latest version, MTL4, is developed by Peter Gottschling and Andrew Lumsdaine. It contains most of MTL2's functionality and adds new optimization techniques as meta-tuning, e.g. loop unrolling of dynamically sized containers can be specified in the function call. Platform-independent performance scalability is reached by recursive data structures and algorithms.P. Gottschling, D.S. Wise, and M.D. Adams: Representation-transparent matrix algorithms with scalable performance. ICS '07: Proc. 21st intern. conf. on Supercomputing, pp. 116--125, ACM Press, New York, 2007. Generic applications can be written in a natural notation, e.g. \`v += A*q - w;\`, while the library dispatches to the appropriate algorithms: matrix vector products vs. matrix products vs. vector scalar products etcetera. The goal is to encapsulate performance issues inside the library and provide scientists an intuitive interface. MTL4 is used in different finite element and finite volume packages, e.g. the FEniCS Project.Dolfin web page within the FEniCS project.

Its population in the 2011 census was 1,690. History The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was in the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Prior to 1974 the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District. An electoral ward with the same name exists. The ward starts at Kewstoke on the Bristol Channel then moves inland to Puxton. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 3,380. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super- Mare county constituency. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020. Geography Being in places only 6 metres above sea level, the settlements of Kewstoke and Sand Bay are, and have been historically, susceptible to flooding. Following several incidents of flooding a sea defence of combined dune system (sand was imported from the estuary to form this) and concrete walls are now in place along much of Sand Road. Whilst the sea defences have proved very effective for the last two decades, concerns about the long-term stability of the dunes, in particular, remain. In the Severn Estuary Shoreline Management Plan, 2000, commissioned by the Severn Estuary Coastal Group and carried out by Gifford Associated Consultants, the importance of sea defence maintenance was highlighted. The report stated that leaving the defences unmaintained would increase the risk of a severe flood to the low-lying residential area of Kewstoke and an extensive area of agricultural land that are currently defended. The authors went on to discuss the importance in the shorter and longer term of ensuring that the current defence line is kept and said that monitoring and research of the coastal processes on the foreshore is recommended. The Sand Bay Management Committee is keeping a close eye on the conditions of both the salt marsh and the sand dunes. Landmarks Monk's Steps (also known as St Kew's Steps) are an ancient set of stone steps leading from St Paul's church up through the woods on Monk's Hill. Although the origins of the steps are unknown, the presence of man in the adjacent woodland on Worlebury Hill can be traced back to the Iron Age. Sport There is a local football team, Kewstoke JFC. The local primary school is Kewstoke Primary school, for children aged 4‚Äì11; there used to be a pre-school at the village hall but it stopped because of a lack of children. Religious sites The local parish church, St Paul's, dates from the 12th century with the tower being built in 1395. The tower is in two stages, with rendered, diagonal buttresses with setbacks which rise through parapet as corner pinnacles. A polygonal stair turret at the south east corner rises to a pyramidal cap. The first stage has two 2-light perpendicular west window under a plain drip mould, and similar but smaller window with carved stops to the south. The second stage has one 2-light perpendicular window under a drip mould with carved stops on each side; all louvres except the west which is blank. A quatrefoil pierced parapet has gargoyles at the corner. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. In 1849 a reliquary was found in St Paul's Church that was believed to have come originally from the priory and to contain the blood of Thomas Becket. It is believed that it was moved to St Paul's for safe keeping at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Near the village, at the base of a promontory called Middle Hope (which extends out into the sea as Sand Point), is Woodspring Priory, which is Grade I listed. The priory was founded in 1210 by William de Courtenay, grandson of Reginald Fitz Urse (one of the knights who murdered Thomas Becket), perhaps to atone for the past action of his grandfather.

She was the first editor-in-chief of the women's fashion magazine, Harper's Bazaar. At the age of eighteen, Booth left the family home for New York City and learned the trade of a vest-maker. She devoted her evenings to study and writing. Booth contributed tales and sketches to various newspapers and magazines but was not paid for them. She began to do reporting and book-reviewing for educational and literary journals, still without any pay in money, but happy at being occasionally paid in books. She said, \\"It is my college, and I must learn my business before I can demand pay.\\" As time went on, she received more and more literary assignments. She widened her circle of friends to those who were beginning to appreciate her abilities. In 1859, she agreed to write a history of New York, but even then, she was unable to support herself wholly, although she had given up vest-making and was writing twelve hours a day. When she was thirty years old, she accepted the position of amanuensis to Dr. J. Marion Sims, and this was the first work of the kind for which she received steady payment. She was now able to do without her father's assistance, and live on her resources in New York, though very plainly. In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, she procured the advance sheets, in the French language, of Ag√©nor de Gasparin's Uprising of a Great People. By working twenty hours a day, she translated the whole book in less than a week, and it was published in a fortnight. The book created a sensation among Northerners, and she received letters of thanks for it from U.S. Senator Charles Sumner and President Abraham Lincoln. But again, she received little compensation for her work. While the war lasted, she translated many French books into English, calculated to rouse patriotic feeling, and was, at one time, summoned to Washington, D.C. to write for the statesmen, receiving only her board at a hotel. She was able at this time to arrange for her father the position of clerk in the New York Custom House. At the end of the civil war, Booth had proved herself so fit as a writer that Messrs. Harper offered her the editorship of Harper's Bazaarheadquartered in New York City a position in which she served from its beginning in 1867 until her death. She was at first diffident as to her abilities, but finally accepted the responsibility, and it was principally due to her that the magazine became so popular. While keeping its character of a home paper, it steadily increased in influence and circulation, and Booth's success was achieved with that of the paper she edited. She is said to have received a larger salary than any woman in the United States at the time. She died, after a short illness, on March 5, 1889. Early life and education Mary Louise Booth was born in Millville, in present-day Yaphank, New York, April 19, 1831. Her parents were William Chatfield Booth and Nancy Monswell. Booth's mother was of French descent, the granddaughter of a refugee from the French Revolution. Booth's father was descended from an early settler, John Booth, who came to the United States in 1649, a kinsman of English politician Sir George Booth. In 1652, John Booth purchased Shelter Island from the Native Americans, for of calico. For at least 200 years, the family stayed close by. William Chatfield Booth, for some years, provided night-watchmen for several large business houses in New York. Along with Mary Louise, another daughter and two sons comprised the remainder of his family, the younger of the sons being Colonel Charles A. Booth, who later spent twenty years in the army. Mary Louise Booth was characterized as a precocious child, so much so that, on being asked, she once confessed she had no more recollection of learning to read either French or English than of learning to talk. As soon as she could walk, her mother said, Booth was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. Before she was five years old, she had finished reading the Bible. She also read Plutarch at a young age, and at age seven, had mastered Racine in the original language, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father. From that time onward, she was an indefatigable reader, devoted to books rather than play. Her father had a considerable library. Before her eleventh birthday, she had acquainted herself with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and similar writers. At this point, Booth was sent away to school. Her parents took all possible pains with her education, and her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no special pleasure in mathematics. At school, Booth learned less than she did by herself. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French, having come across a French primer. She became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones and continued to study in this way. Later, she acquired German in the same manner. Being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them but made herself so proficient in them in later years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French, reading them aloud in English. When Booth was about thirteen years of age, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York, and there her father organized the first public school that was established in that city. Mary helped her father teach at school. He could never quite bring himself to believe that she was capable of her own financial support, and always insisted upon giving her generous gifts. In 1845 and 1846, she taught in her father's school in Williamsburg, New York, but gave up that pursuit on account of her health, and devoted herself to literature. As Booth grew older, her determination to make literature her profession became very strong. As she was the oldest of four children, her father did not feel that it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when she was eighteen years old, Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York as she could not depend entirely upon her father. Early career A friend who was a vest- maker offered to teach Booth the trade, and this enabled her to carry out her plan of going to New York. She took a small room in the city and went home only for Sundays, as the communication between Williamsburg and New York was very slow in those days, and the journey could not be made in less than three hours. Two rooms were always kept ready for her in her parents' house. But her family felt so little sympathy in her literary work that she rarely mentioned it at home. History of the City of New York 1859 by Mary Louise Booth Booth wrote tales and sketches for newspapers and magazines. She translated from the French The Marble-Worker's Manual (New York, 1856) and The Clock and Watch Maker's Manual. She translated Joseph M√©ry's Andr√© Ch√©nier and Edmond Fran√ßois Valentin About's The King of the Mountains for Emerson's Magazine, which also published Booth's original articles. She next translated Victor Cousin's Secret History of the French Court: or, Life and Times of Madame de Chevreuse (1859). That same year, the first edition of her History of the City of New York appeared, which was the result of great research. It was her prized possession. Next, she assisted Orlando Williams Wight in making a series of translations of the French classics, and she also translated About's Germaine (Boston, 1860). A friend had suggested to Booth that no complete history of New York City had ever been written and that it might be well to prepare such a one for the use of schools. She began the undertaking, and, after some years finished a draft which, on the request of a publisher, became the basis of a more important work upon the same subject. During her work, Booth had full access to libraries and archives. Washington Irving sent her a letter of cordial encouragement, and D. T. Valentine, Henry B. Dawson, William John Davis, Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, and numerous others provided her with documents and assistance. \\"My Dear Miss Booth,\\" wrote historian Benson John Lossing, \\"the citizens of New York owe you a debt of gratitude for this popular story of the life of the great metropolis, containing so many important facts in its history, and included in one volume accessible to all. I congratulate you on the completeness of the task and the admirable manner in which it has been performed.\\" Booth's history of New York City appeared in one large volume. It was so well-received that the publisher proposed Booth should go abroad and write popular histories of the great European capitals, London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. Though the future appeared bright for the young writer, the approach of the civil war and other circumstances prevented her travel. Civil War era Shortly after the publication of the first edition of this work, the civil war broke out. Booth had always been an anti-slavery partisan and a sympathizer with movements for what she considered progress. Booth was enlisted on the side of the Union and longed to do something to help the cause. However, she did not feel qualified to act as a nurse in military hospitals. After she received an advance copy of Count Ag√©nor de Gasparin's Un Grand Peuple Qui Se Releve (\\"Uprising of a Great People\\"), she at once saw her opportunity in how she could be of assistance. She took the work to Charles Scribner, proposing he should publish it. He stated that he would gladly do so if the translation were ready, but that the war would be over before the book was out; but if it could be ready in a week, he would publish it. Booth went home and went to work, receiving the proof-sheets at night and returning them with a fresh copy in the morning. Within a week, the translation was finished, and in a fortnight, the book was published. Nothing else published during the war made such a sensation as this volume. The newspapers of the day were full of reviews and notices, eulogistic and otherwise, according to the party represented. \\"It is worth a whole phalanx in the cause of human freedom,\\" wrote Senator Sumner. The publication of the translation put Booth into communication with Gasparin and his wife, who begged her to visit them in Switzerland. A second edition of the history was published in 1867, and a third edition, revised, appeared in 1880. A large paper edition of the work was taken by well-known book-collectors, extended and illustrated by them with supplementary prints, portraits, and autographs. One copy, enlarged to folio and extended to nine volumes by several thousand maps, letters, and other illustrations, was owned in the city of New York. Another was owned by Booth, enriched by more than two thousand illustrations on inserted leaves. In rapid succession appeared Booth's translations of Gasparin's America before Europe (New York, 1861), √âdouard Ren√© de Laboulaye's Paris in America (New York, 1865), and Augustin Cochin's Results of Emancipation and Results of Slavery (Boston, 1862). For this work, she received praise and encouragement from President Lincoln, Senator Sumner, and other statesmen. During the entire war, she maintained a correspondence with Cochin, Gasparin, Laboulaye, Henri Martin, Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert, and other European sympathizers with the Union. At that time, she also translated the Countess de Gasparin's Vesper, Camille, and Human Sorrows, and Count Gasparin's Happiness. Documents forwarded to her by French friends of the Union were translated and published in pamphlets, issued by the Union League Club, or printed in the New York journals. Booth translated Martin's History of France. The two volumes treating of The Age of Louis XIV were issued in 1864, and two others, the last of the seventeen volumes of the original work, in 1866 under the title of The Decline of the French Monarchy. It was intended to follow these with the other volumes from the beginning, but, although she translated two others, the enterprise was abandoned, and no more were printed. Her translation of Martin's abridgment of his History of France appeared in 1880. She also translated Laboulaye's Fairy Book, Jean Mac√©'s Fairy Tales, and Blaise Pascal's Lettres provinciales (Provincial Letters). She received hundreds of appreciative letters from statesmen ‚Äî Henry Winter Davis, Senator James Rood Doolittle, Galusha A. Grow, Dr. Francis Lieber, Dr. Bell, the president of the Sanitary Commission, and a host of others, among them Cassius M. Clay, and Attorney-General James Speed. Her translations ran to nearly forty volumes. She had thought of adding to this number, at the request of James Thomas Fields, an abridgment of George Sand's voluminous Histoire de ma vie; circumstances, however, prevented the completion of the work. Harper's Bazaar Messrs. Harper Harper's Bazaar (1868) Harper's Bazaar (1883) In the year 1867, Booth undertook another enterprise in assuming the management of Harper's Bazaar, a weekly journal devoted to the pleasure and improvement of the home. For a long time, she had good relations with the Harpers, the four brothers who founded the magazine which bears their name, and who conducted its business. Under her editorial management, it was very successful, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand. While she had assistants in every department, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps. The influence of such a paper within American homes was highly regarded. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly sixteen years and helped to shape the domestic life of a generation. Personal life She lived in New York City, in the neighborhood of Central Park, in a house which Booth owned, with her longtime companion, Mrs. Anne W. Wright, a friendship that was begun in childhood. Their house was well-adapted to entertaining. There were always guests, and in the salon, every Saturday night, there was an assemblage of authors, singers, players, musicians, statesmen, travelers, publishers, and journalists. Booth died in New York after a short illness on March 5, 1889.

The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. About The facility opened on February 20, 1884, and, like other such schools, its mission was to educate and teach Christianity and European- American culture to Native American children for assimilation. The village of Genoa was selected because the Federal Government already owned the former Pawnee Reservation property there; however, existing buildings at the site were unsuitable and in poor repair. The Pawnee had been removed to Indian Territory in 1879. Like many buildings designed for Indian school campuses, the main building was a simple three-story structure with a hipped roof and a small triangular pediment above the center entrance. The pairs of tall windows and the strong horizontal lines across the front created a balanced composition. The building extended at length from its front facade.

It was the first regular sports programme to be transmitted by television. The programme was presented by Howard Marshall, who was a well known BBC radio presenter, and transmitted once per month. Each edition would endure for twenty minutes and featured Marshall reviewing notable sporting events that had occurred during the past month and interviewing sportsmen and women. Film clips from relevant sporting events would also be shown. The first episode was shown on 30 April 1937, and the series continued until the suspension of the BBC Television Service for the duration of World War II during September 1939. The programme was not reinstated upon the resumption of the service during 1946. As the editions were all transmitted live from the BBC's Alexandra Palace studios, and the BBC did not have any professional method of recording broadcasts at the time, nothing survives of the series in the archives, except for some still photographs.

There is one podium/desk on the trading floor for each of the exchange's three thousand or so stocks. The New York stock exchange trading floor in September 1963, before the introduction of electronic readouts and computer screens Open outcry \\"pit\\" at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1993 CBOT \\"The Pit\\" in 1908 Open outcry is a method of communication between professionals on a stock exchange or futures exchange typically on a trading floor. It involves shouting and the use of hand signals to transfer information primarily about buy and sell orders. floor trading hand signals The part of the trading floor where this takes place is called a pit. In an open outcry auction, bids and offers must be made out in the open market, giving all participants a chance to compete for the order with the best price. New bids or offers would be made if better than previous pricing for efficient price discovery. Exchanges also value positions marked to these public market prices on a daily basis. In contrast, over-the-counter markets are where bids and offers are negotiated privately between principals. Since the development of the stock exchange in the 17th century in Amsterdam, open outcry was the main method used to communicate among traders. This started changing in the latter half of the 20th century, first through the use of telephone trading, and then starting in the 1980s with electronic trading systems. , a few exchanges still had floor trading using open outcry. The supporters of electronic trading claim that they are faster, cheaper, more efficient for users, and less prone to manipulation by market makers and broker/dealers. However, many traders still advocate for the open outcry system on the basis that the physical contact allows traders to speculate as to a buyer/seller's motives or intentions and adjust their positions accordingly. As of 2010, most stocks and futures contracts were no longer traded using open outcry due to the lower cost of the aforementioned technological advances. As of 2017, open outcry in the United States was very limited, such as in a much more stream-lined form at the Chicago Board of Trade owned by the CME Group. History Since the 1980s, the open outcry systems have been being replaced by electronic trading systems (such as CATS and Globex). Floor trading is the meeting of traders or stockbrokers at a specific venue referred to as a trading floor or pit to buy and sell financial instruments using open outcry method to communicate with each other. These venues are typically stock exchanges or futures exchanges and transactions are executed by members of such an exchange using specific language or hand signals. During the 1980s and 1990s, phone and electronic trading replaced physical floor trading in most exchanges around the world., As of 2007, few exchanges still have floor trading. One example is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which still executes a small percentage of its trades on the floor. That means that the traders actually form a group around the post on the floor of the market for the specialist, someone that works for one of the NYSE member firms and handles the stock. As in an auction, there are shouts from those that want to sell and those that want to buy. The specialist facilitates in the match and centralizing the trades. On 24 January 2007, the NYSE went from being strictly an auction market to a hybrid market that encompassed both the auction method and an electronic trading method that immediately makes the trade electronically. A small group of extremely high-priced stocks isn't on this trading system and is still auctioned on the trading floor. Even though over 82 percent of the trades take place electronically, the action on the floor of the stock exchange still has its place. While electronic trading is faster and provides for anonymity, there is more opportunity to improve the price of a share if it goes to the floor. Investors maintain the right to select the method they want to use. The London Metal Exchange is the last open outcry exchange in Europe. It utilises short periods of face-to-face \\"ring trading\\" for price discovery, with further trades taking place electronically. =Conversion to electronic trading= * The London Stock Exchange moved to electronic trading in 1986. * The Borsa Italiana, Italy's stock market, located in Milan, moved to electronic trading in 1994. * The Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, embraced electronic trading in 1995 by introducing the BSE Online Trading (BOLT) System on 14 March 1995. * The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) adopted electronic trading on 7 June 1996. * The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) adopted electronic trading (The Automated Trading System (ATS)) in 1997. * The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) adopted electronic trading in 1997. * The Korea Exchange (KRX) adopted electronic trading in 1997. * International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) moved to electronic trading in 2005. * Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) moved to electronic trading in 2008. * New York Stock Exchange, 2006-2007, under John ThainTechnology squeezes out real, live traders, Adam Shell, USA Today, 2007 7 11 * New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), 2006. Since the 1980s, Nymex had a virtual monopoly on 'open market' oil futures trading, but the electronically based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) began trading oil contracts that were extremely similar to Nymex's in the early 2000s and Nymex began to lose market share almost immediately. The pit-traders at Nymex had been resisting the electronic move for decades, but the executives believed the exchange had to move to the electronic format, or it would cease to exist as a viable business. The executives introduced CME's Globex system into Nymex in 2006.The Asylum, Leah McGrath Goodman, 2011, Harper Collins In 2016, NYMEX ceased all open outcry trading, leaving only open outcry at its sister exchange the Chicago Board of Trade. Hand signals Floor hand signals are used to communicate buy and sell information in an open outcry trading environment. The system is used at futures exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Traders usually flash the signals quickly across a room to make a sale or a purchase. Signals that occur with palms facing out and hands away from the body are an indication the gesturer wishes to sell. When traders face their palms in and hold their hands up, they are gesturing to buy. Numbers one through five are gestured on one hand, and six through ten are gestured in the same way only held sideways at a 90-degree angle (index finger out sideways is six, two fingers is seven, and so on). Numbers gestured from the forehead are blocks of ten, and blocks of hundreds and thousands can also be displayed. The signals can otherwise be used to indicate months, specific trade or option combinations, or additional market information. These rules may vary among exchanges or even among floors within the same exchange; however, the purpose of the gestures remains the same.

Storylines Ray Langton was born at Number 2 Gas Street. Throughout his childhood, he was in trouble with the police most of the time. An ex-borstal boy, Ray built up a reputation as a troublemaker. He first appeared in the Street in 1966 but was sent away by Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) after he threatened Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss). Nevertheless, Ray returned two years later and Len gave him a job at his building firm and invited him to move into his bachelor pad at No.9. Ray hoped to start his own business but settled for a partnership with Len and Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield). Ray's younger sister, Janice (Paula Wilcox), visited briefly in 1969. Ray was a womaniser and was involved with many women while living in the Street, including Sandra Butler (Patricia Fuller), Audrey Fleming (Gillian McCann), Vicki Bright (Clare Sutcliffe) and Sue Silcock (Angela Scoular). In 1975, he married the yard's secretary, Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride), and they moved into No.5; their daughter, Tracy (Christabel Finch), was born in 1977. His roving eye led him into an affair with waitress Janice Stubbs (Angela Bruce). Deirdre found out so he ended the affair and made plans to move to the Netherlands for a new life and wanted Deirdre and Tracy to come with him. She initially agreed but changed her mind at the last minute so Ray left the street alone. Ray kept in touch and sent Tracy presents, but this dwindled over the years. Eventually, he contacted Deirdre, asking for a divorce as his new partner was pregnant with his child. Ray divorced his second wife sometime around 2000. When he discovered he had stomach cancer in 2005, he returned to Weatherfield to look for Tracy so he could make amends, arriving on Ken and Deirdre's wedding day and hit baby Amy Barlow (Rebecca Pike)'s pram. He met Deirdre, Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Ken Barlow (William Roache) at the hospital and realised that Amy was his granddaughter and Tracy was her mother. Ray told them that he had terminal stomach cancer and that he had divorced his Dutch wife a few years before. He stayed with Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) and Tracy softened towards Ray. He attended Ken and Deirdre's wedding and wished the couple well. During the reception in the Rovers Return, Ray had died of his illness, much to Tracy's distress. In 2017, Tracy tells Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard), Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) and Amy about Ray. She tells them that Ken was more of a father to her than her birth father. Development Ray Langton's departure in 1978 came due to Neville Buswell quitting acting and later leaving to work in Las Vegas. However, he returned in 2005 for a brief stint, 27 years since he portrayed the character. Neville Buswell is the fourth cast member to have the longest break in Coronation Street, which is a 27-year absence from 1978 to 2005. As of 2011, Philip Lowrie, who played Dennis Tanner, has the record for the longest break between TV appearances in the same show, having been absent for 43 years. Other appearances * Ray made a brief cameo appearance in Viva Las Vegas!, a VHS spin-off written by Russell T. Davies and released in 1998, as Buswell was living in Las Vegas at the time. In the storyline Ray is working as a barman and unexpectedly meets Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), who is holidaying there. When Vera brings him up to date on some of the things that have happened in Weatherfield since his departure, Ray assumes she must be joking and responds by telling her he's now married to a man and is hiding from his evil twin.

She was born on screen during the episode broadcast on 9 February 2004. To date, the character has been portrayed by eight child actors; Holly Bowyer, Rebecca Pike, Louisa Morris, Rachel and Sarah Corker, Madison Hampson, Amber Chadwick and Elle Mulvaney, making her the most recast character in Coronation Street. Although Amy's surname has stayed Barlow, Chadwick was credited as Amy McDonald for three episodes from 2009 to 2010. Amy is the daughter of Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), granddaughter of Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), Ray Langton (Neville Buswell), Ken Barlow (William Roache), Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) and the cousin of Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) and Adam Barlow (Iain De Caestecker; Sam Robertson). Amy's storylines have included: her mother's selling her to Roy Cropper (David Neilson), who was presumed to be the father of Amy, and his wife, Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh); her becoming lactose intolerant and purposefully making herself ill so that her parents would be nice to each other; her losing her great-grandmother Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and grandmother Deirdre; and her being stuck in Victoria Court flats when a fire was accidentally started by Tracy and falling pregnant at the age of 14 by gang leader Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) and having a secret abortion without telling her parents. Storylines In August 2003, after a one-night stand with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) falls pregnant. However, Tracy drugs the much older Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and pretends that she has had sex with him, leading him to believe he is the father. Tracy offers to sell her baby to Roy and his wife, Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), and they accept. Roy marries Tracy to ensure he would be named the baby's carer. Tracy gives birth to a daughter in February 2004 and she is called Patience by Roy and Hayley. Tracy later changes her mind and demands her daughter back during Steve's wedding, admitting that he is the father. Roy and Hayley hand her back and Tracy renames her Amy. Steve's wife, Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones), resents Amy's presence, even causing a fight at her christening. In December 2004, Karen later steals Tracy's car, unaware Amy is in the back. She burns the car, making Tracy believe that Amy is still in it when she is actually safe. In January 2007, Tracy murders Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) and is subsequently imprisoned. Amy moves in with Steve and his mother Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) at The Rovers Return Inn. As a toddler, Amy is almost knocked down by Harry Mason (Jack Ellis) while she is meant to be looked after by Darryl Morton (Jonathan Dixon). In August 2009, Steve marries Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), who cares for Amy as if she was her daughter. In May 2010, when Amy is bullied about Tracy, Becky tells her about Tracy being in prison and they later visit her. Tracy's grandmother Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) dies in the same month. Becky looks after a confused and upset six-year-old Amy and she ties a picture to a balloon for Blanche. Tracy attends Blanche's funeral and is reunited with Amy, who is initially frightened of her. On Christmas Day 2010, Amy is upset further when Tracy attacks Becky. Tracy is freed and visits Amy, who tells her about Steve and Becky buying Max Turner (Harry McDermott). Amy moves in with Tracy at the Barlow house. In early 2011, Amy goes to Blackpool with Steve and Tracy. When she becomes fed up with them arguing, she runs off. Amy is eventually found and the family spend the night in Blackpool, after Steve's car is towed away. Amy is diagnosed with a dairy allergy after she ends up in hospital. Amy deliberately starts making herself ill, so Steve will come and look after her with Tracy. Tracy and Steve are mortified when Amy admits she has been drinking milk on purpose in a bid for more attention. In the summer of 2011, Steve leaves Amy with Tracy's adoptive nephew James Cunningham (James Roache), when he has a work problem to deal with. James asks Amy to go upstairs, but she overhears his conversation with a surveyor. James threatens to put Tracy in prison if Amy tells anyone. A few days later, Amy tells Tracy and James insists she is making the story up. Tracy and Amy then leave for London for a few weeks. On their return in August 2011, Tracy announces she is pregnant and she and Steve start a proper relationship. Amy is excited to have two new siblings and Steve and Tracy back together. In December 2011, Amy acts in the local nativity play and she asks to visit Becky, following a fire at her flat on Christmas Day 2011. In January 2012, Amy is a bridesmaid at Tracy and Steve's wedding, but Steve and Tracy split up shortly afterwards. Steve divides the house in two, with Amy living upstairs with Tracy. When Steve cuts the electricity, Tracy asks her parents Ken (William Roache) and Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) to look after Amy. Steve later removes the partition and moves out, leaving Amy and Tracy to live with Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and her son, Craig Tinker (Colson Smith). Lesley Kershaw (Judy Holt) takes Amy to the park. Steve catches up with them and brings Amy home to a worried Tracy. In June 2012, Amy notices her pocket money has gone missing from her piggy bank, but Tracy does not believe her. It later transpires that Amy's adoptive cousin Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) stole it along with Aadi Alahan's (Zennon Ditchett) game console. Tracy and Amy are left homeless when Steve decides to sell number 13, but they eventually move in with Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) and Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden).

Ken and Deirdre accuse Tracy of neglect and Amy goes to live with Steve, Michelle and Michelle's adoptive son Ryan Connor (Sol Heras) in their small 2 bedroom flat and Amy has to sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge. However, when Stella Price (Michelle Collins) puts The Rovers up for sale, Steve buys it back from her and Ryan goes to live in Ibiza. Liz returns as landlady of The Rovers and she also lives there. Amy stays with Ken, Deirdre and Tracy twice a week, but Tracy usually stays at Rob's flat for the rest of the time. By the time Amy turns 10, it is clear that she has inherited troublemaking traits from her mother. This starts when Amy taunts Simon when his father, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), is sent to prison for the murder of Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Whilst being looked after by Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) and her girlfriend, Maddie Heath (Amy James- Kelly), Amy becomes jealous of the amount of attention that Simon is getting. After Maddie berates Amy for bullying Simon, Amy sneaks off to see Tracy and lies that Maddie has threatened to hit her. A week later, Simon and Amy are once again looked after by Maddie and Sophie and again, Amy is jealous of the attention that Maddie shows to Simon. When they stop at The Kabin to get some sweets, Amy deliberately lets Deirdre's dog, Eccles, off her lead, knowing that the dog going missing would greatly upset Simon. Later, Sophie and Maddie find the dog and return her home to a relieved Deirdre and Simon.

The Barlows begin searching for the dog and a couple of days later, Ken spots Sophie and Maddie taking her for a walk. Ken brings the dog home and Tracy again insists that the dog has to go. Ken tries to get Amy to tell the truth about her injury and she eventually reveals that she lied about the dog biting her. Maddie praises Amy for telling the truth, telling her that she was very brave. In May 2015, Amy, along with Carla Connor (Alison King), becomes trapped in a fire in the Victoria Court flats after it was accidentally started by Tracy.

In March 2017, Tracy and Amy believe Ken does not love them as much compared to the Barlow family. Amy smashes a violin from a skip, pretending it is hers, and gets the money from Ken for a replacement, but she later calls someone and leaves the money for the violin at the house. When Ken is found unconscious at the bottom of the stairs (see Who Attacked Ken?), the police believe he was pushed and the family are all suspects and Amy secretly has been in contact with Ken's grandson, Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson), who was supposedly in Canada. In April 2017, when Adam suspects Tracy attacked Ken, he tries to get information from Amy, but she refuses to say anything against Tracy and Amy phones the police, telling them that Adam's alibi was false.

When Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and his boyfriend Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) become guardians of Billy's goddaughter, Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman), Tracy brings Amy to meet Summer. Amy and Summer do not interact and in Billy and Todd's absence, they argue and Amy accuses Summer of hitting her.

In September 2017, Amy and Asha put blue paint on the window wipers of Roy's car, angering Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), who make Amy and Asha put on a Boney M tribute act for their punishment. Wanting to be friends with Amy and Asha, Summer uses shaving foam to draw an inappropriate image on a teacher's car, but is caught, which results in Billy and Todd being called in. Simon attempts to force Summer to smoke cigarettes he found, but Summer takes them for herself and smokes them when she is emotional. Summer is found unconscious by Simon and Amy and is taken to hospital, where it turns out she smoked spice and Billy and Todd make amends. Peter and his partner, Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor), find out from Simon, Amy, Aadi and Asha that Simon had the cigarette. Amy is not happy when Steve and Tracy get back together. After lying about her whereabouts, Steve and Tracy turn up at one of Amy's friends party, where Amy is caught kissing a boy. Amy helps Summer to look for Billy, but are put in danger when a homeless man tricks them into knowing his whereabouts, but Peter gets them away. By the age of 14 years old, Amy discovers she is pregnant and when she tells her parents, Steve reacts negatively and accuses Aadi and Simon of impregnating her. Tracy demands Amy to reveal the identity of her baby's father, but Amy claims she does not know who he is as she had met him at a Christmas party and that it was her first time having sex. Amy considers having an abortion but changes her mind shortly after talking to teenage mother Faye Windass (Ellie Leach). Amy then later meets with Simon's enemy Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) to discuss their one night stand and her pregnancy, revealing him to be the father. Upon realising Amy is underage, Tyler rejects Amy and threatens her to have an abortion. Tracy and Steve later learn the truth of the paternity and tells Amy that they have decided to adopt her baby and raise it as their own child. When Tyler firmly tells Amy that he doesn't want to be a father and overwhelmed with Tracy and Steve's excitement of adopting the baby, Amy secretly has an abortion with Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) by her side at the clinic. Tracy learns of Amy's secret and admits to the realisation that she has neglected Amy's emotional feelings over the baby. Casting Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike shared the role of newborn Amy Barlow in February 2004 for a month until Bowyer left. Pike continued in the role until July 2005 when she was replaced with Louisa Morris. Morris departed two months later and the role was briefly taken over by twins Rachel and Sarah Corker for two episodes in September. Amy was once again recast later that month with Madison Hampson. Hampson quit Coronation Street in early 2006. Amber Chadwick was cast as Amy Barlow when Hampson departed with Chadwick first appearing onscreen in March 2006. Chadwick played the role until 2010 when the decision was made to recast Amy to tie in with the return of her onscreen mother Tracy. The casting of seven- year-old Elle Mulvaney was announced in March 2010. A spokeswoman said \\"Amy has some big storylines coming up so we decided to recast an older child who could play younger. This is common practice. For example, Alex Bain is two years older than Simon is on screen.\\" Mulvaney first appeared onscreen in May 2010. DevelopmentEarly development= In April 2011, Tracy was accused of poisoning Amy: when Amy came down with a mysterious illness, Becky blamed Tracy. A source said \\"Becky loves Amy and can't bear to see her suffering. She also can't bear seeing Steve and Tracy together. She is jealous and she quickly realises that Tracy is feeding off the attention Steve is giving them both. Becky can handle herself but Tracy is a dangerous enemy to make,\\" the insider added. \\"If Steve believes Tracy over Becky, it could signal the end of their marriage.\\" In May 2011, Amy was diagnosed as being Lactose intolerant and Tracy found out that Amy had been drinking milk to make herself ill in order to make her parents nicer. Kate Ford said of Amy's actions \\"[Tracy] catches Amy taking milk from the fridge. Amy drops the milk and locks herself in the front room and Tracy calls Steve round to coax her out. Amy tells them she's been making herself ill because then Steve comes round and her parents are nicer to each other...both she and Steve feel very guilty. They haven't behaved well and at times have forgotten that there's a child involved.\\" In November 2015, it was announced that Simon would lash out at Amy at Christmas as part of Simon's domestic abuse plot, where he has been attacking his stepmother, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). A source said that \\"The Barlows are going to be central to Coronation Street in the run up to Christmas. The close-knit family will be put under extreme strain and viewers will be left wondering if they can get through the turmoil.\\" =Teenage pregnancy= Coronation Street producer Iain MacLeod said there are ‚Äúgreat things coming up at Christmas\\" for \\"the unlikely character\\" Amy; speculation arose Amy could kill Tracy due to recent storylines and Amy's \\"menacing nature in the past.\\" In November 2018, it was reported that Amy would fall pregnant in a \\"dramatic\\" and \\"scandal[ous]\\" storyline that leaves Tracy and Steve in \\"turmoil\\" as they \\"hit the roof\\" and \\"lose their rag\\"; Amy's life will also be turned \\"upside down\\" as she seeks support from Liz. Duncan Lindsay from Metro said Amy's storylines \\"don't come much more major than this\\" as well as believing Mulvaney \\"will be at the centre of some highly dramatic scenes.\\" Lindsay also added that similarities will be drawn between Amy's teenage pregnancy and that of Sarah Platt's (Tina O'Brien) from 2000. Reception During the May 2015 episodes, which saw a fire started by Tracy at the Victoria Court flats, Amy was one of the characters trapped in the fire. Duncan Lindsay for the Metro said of Amy's performance in these episodes \\"The performances from Corrie acting titans such as Kate Ford [Tracy], Alison King [Carla] and Jane Danson [Leanne] always add to the drama, and young Elle Mulvaney, who plays Amy, is surely now a contender for next year's Young Performance prize at the British Soap Awards.\\" For her portrayal as Amy, Mulvaney has been longlisted 3 times in 2010, 2011 and 2012 at the Inside Soap Awards for Best Young Actor. Mulvaney won the Best Young Actor award at The British Soap Awards 2017. In August 2017, Mulvaney was longlisted for Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap Awards. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.

She was played by Lynne Carol from the show's inception in 1960, from the second episode until the character's death in 1964. Creation The character of Martha was conceived early on, when Tony Warren realised that the character he devised Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) would need some drinking companions. His experiences of the real-world Ena's and their cronies greatly informed the character; Warren said of it, \\"Whenever you got tough old viragoes like Ena, they always had henchmen. They generally had a talkative one that could be shouted down, and then there was always a silent one who nodded but was a bit rebellious\\".Minnie Caldwell Remembered - A Tribute to Margot Bryant The former character outline turned into Martha Longhurst, and the latter Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant). =Casting= Martha was present in the second of the two dry runs made in November 1960, where she was played by fellow Welsh-born actress Doris Hare. During final casting for the show proper, casting director Margaret Morris offered Hare the larger part of Ena Sharples, but Hare, a noted theatre actress had to turn it down as she had commitments with the Royal Shakespeare Company.The Coronation Street Story (Boxtree Limited, 1995) Lynne Carol had been a child performer since the age of three and went on to have a long career in theatre, radio and television. Though Martha was said to be the second-oldest character in the programme, 46-year-old Carol was given the part of the 64-year-old Martha. Her relative youth compared with her co-stars was obscured by the character's wardrobe, with Martha normally wearing a hairnet, beret, spectacles, and an old mackintosh, all of which were provided by Carol who bought them second- hand in a jumble sale. =Development= Martha and Minnie were initially supporting characters, with their storylines revolving around Ena Sharples. Over time, they got stories of their own, notably Martha's attempts to affect a relationship with her old school friend Ted Ashley (Jerold Wells). The three were most often seen in the Rovers snug, where they reminisced and shared the latest gossip over glasses of milk stout. Most of these scenes weren't connected to any storylines, but proved very popular with viewers. Carol stated in an interview, \\"The scriptwriters used to say that. 'We don't need to think about scenes for you, you three, we can say anything, and as soon as they see those three chairs round the table that's it, and you can make it funny without meaning to, just by being ordinary.'\\" \\".Minnie Caldwell Remembered - A Tribute to Margot Bryant About the popularity of Martha in particular, Carol once told Weekend: \\"There are an awful lot of Marthas in the world. Some viewers used to tell me to mind my own business but most people could see that Martha was really a pathetic old dear.\\"The Coronation Street Story (Boxtree Limited, 1995) Storylines By the 1960s, Martha had retired and was drawing her pension. Money was tight, but she made it last without having to work to supplement it. In December, when Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) collapsed due to stress and had a spell in hospital, Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) asked Martha to temporarily take over Ena's caretaker duties at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. Martha accepted but only lasted a few days as Ena's suspicious nature led her to walk out of hospital and return to her vestry, senile decay or not. Dismissing Martha from her post, Ena caught her friend using her feather duster and accused her of rooting through her things. Martha protested her innocence, and the pair spent a few weeks not speaking to each other until they agreed to forgive and forget. In March 1963, Martha was taken on by Jack (Arthur Leslie) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as the new Rovers Return Inn cleaner, and she also worked in the same capacity at Laurie Fraser's (Stanley Meadows) Viaduct Sporting Club the following year. Although she pushed herself hard, Martha was pleased to be able to put some money away. In the summer of 1963, Martha saw a doctor and was put on pills which she took three times a day - a fact she kept private even from her family and friends. With health issues and money stashed away, Martha was of a mind to break from her mundane routine. The catalyst was the return of Ted Ashley (Jerold Wells), a former classmate at Bessie Street who had long since emigrated to Australia and made a good life for himself as a farmer and shopkeeper. Ted was back in Weatherfield to look up old friends and visit his cousin Clara - who also happened to be Martha's next-door neighbour. Setting her cap at Ted, who was now a widower, Martha asked Clara to invite him over to hers for tea. Ena's suspicions were aroused when Martha bought a tin of best salmon from the corner shop and invited both her and Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) to tea, even though it wasn't a Sunday. Ted did turn up, but he barely remembered the ladies from his school days and got his memories of them hopelessly confused. Martha clung to Ted throughout his stay, and the man was too gentlemanly to put her off. When Martha told him that she had never been out of Lancashire, Ted suggested that she go to London to stay with his sister Alice as she missed the north. Martha took this as an invitation to go along with him when he left Weatherfield, and she immediately made travel arrangements - much to the surprise of Ted, who had no romantic interest in Martha. Martha went to London expecting a proposal from Ted, but none came and instead she spent her time sightseeing on her own. Back in Weatherfield, a humiliated Martha hid away from her friends, although Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) spotted her going into her house and told everyone that she was back. Ena and Minnie confronted her and she sheepishly admitted that Ted had shown no affection for her whatsoever. =Death= Martha had enjoyed London itself and the excursion had whetted her appetite for travel. When invited to go on holiday in Spain with her daughter Lily Haddon (Stephanie Bidmead) and family, Martha bought her first passport and proudly showed it off to anyone who showed the slightest interest. It was during a singsong at a party in the Rovers thrown by Frank Barlow to celebrate his selling his shop that Martha became ill and retreated to her usual chair in the empty snug. Unnoticed by anyone else, Martha had a sudden heart attack which killed her almost instantly. She was eventually spotted by Myra Booth (Susan Jameson), who thought that she had fallen asleep. When Jack Walker failed to revive her, he alerted Annie and Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). While Jack called for a doctor, the revellers stopped singing and looked towards the snug one by one. Ena, on the harmonium, was the last to notice. Failing to find a pulse, Len declared Martha dead. Martha was laid out in the vestry bedroom prior to being buried in the family plot with her husband, Percy. Her insurance policies only came to ¬£22, 4s and 9d; not enough for a funeral, so Lily and her husband Wilf (Henry Livings) had to pay the rest. Helping Lily clear out the house, Ena and Minnie happened upon the record Martha had made in Blackpool in 1934. Although unable to identify the man in the recording, they were pleased to know that their friend had once had some fun in her life. =Legacy= The 1964 episode of her death was not the last time Martha Longhurst featured in a Coronation Street storyline. Over ten years after her death, Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) reported hearing a voice like Martha's in the snug. Ena also claimed that she had seen Martha's ghost in the snug on several occasions. The residents later used a ouija board to try and call Martha from beyond the grave; the storyline concluded with Martha's glasses being found in the snug, in the exact position they were when they toppled off her face as she suffered her heart attack. Martha was referenced again almost forty years later, on 2 September 2011, when Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) joked that a mysterious voice Roy Cropper (David Neilson) could hear was \\"Martha Longhurst's ghost\\". DepartureBackground= In 1964, 29-year-old ex-journalist Tim Aspinall replaced Margaret Morris as Coronation Street's producer. January that year had seen Coronation Street beaten to first place in the ratings by a regular episode of another TV programme for the first time since November 1961 (the sitcom Steptoe and Son on BBC One). Although ratings were actually up on the same month in 1963, Aspinall felt that Coronation Street needed a shake-up. =Axing= Carol was one of several unsuspecting cast members informed by Margaret Morris that they had been fired. Nearly half the cast were axed, although some of them were granted a reprieve by H.V. Kershaw when he returned as producer in September after working on Granada's The Villains. Carol was the first to depart, with Martha suffering a fatal stroke in the Rovers snug in Tim Aspinall's inaugural episode as producer, broadcast on 13 May 1964. Due to the nature of the character's exit, and her popularity with the cast and viewers, Carol's colleagues fought her sacking, with Violet Carson threatening to resign. She was talked round by Carol. When rehearsing the death scene, Peter Adamson refused to deliver the line \\"she's dead\\", and during recording he hesitated before saying it so that his words could be cut, with the order likely to come from Cecil Bernstein, one of Granada's chairmen who was the programme's strongest advocate within senior management. However, no such order was given. After her sacking was announced by the press on 7 April, Carol spoke to a reporter, where she was resigned to her fate: \\"They've been three wonderful years, and I am sorry to be leaving so many good friends behind me.\\" Martha was the first character to have an on-screen burial. The graveside scenes were shot on location at Manchester General Cemetery in Harphurey on Tuesday 12 May. The episode featuring Martha's death was shown with silent end credits played over a shot of Martha's glasses, passport and sherry glass on the snug table she was sitting at when she died. Carol played Martha one further time; her voice was heard in the following episode, when Ena and Minnie played an old recording of Martha's in which she and an unknown man called Philip proclaimed their love for each other. The same episode featured Stephanie Bidmead as Lily Haddon, Martha's daughter who previously had been spoken of frequently but never seen. Impact The killing of Martha has since been heavily criticised, with H.V. Kershaw describing it as one of the worst decisions in Coronation Street history. Kershaw: \\"No doubt Tim Aspinall felt that by such action he would bring the programme a great deal of publicity and in this he certainly succeeded. However I do feel - and this is only a personal opinion - that he broke the rule of conservation. By killing an established character he doubtlessly gave us a few episodes of high drama and created a talking-point in the factories and laundrettes which boosted our viewing figures for a period, but when the dust settled we were simply left with a Coronation Street without Martha Longhurst. The trio had been reduced to a rather sad duet and there is little doubt that by that one action many future stories were denied us.\\"The Street Where I Live (Granada Publishing Limited, 1981) Subsequent producers have lamented the loss of Martha, with Bill Podmore referring to it as \\"the Street's greatest mistake\\". After the death of actress Margot Bryant in 1988, Podmore appeared with Carol on a BBC Open Air programme where they discussed the possibility of Carol returning to the programme as Martha's twin sister, who had been living in Australia, although the idea went no further.Coronation Street: The Inside Story (Macdonald & co, 1990) References Longhurst, Martha Longhurst, Martha Longhurst, Martha Longhurst, Martha ","title":"Martha Longhurst"},{"id":"2731977","text":"The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, Public Law 106-390, also called DMA2K, is U.S. federal legislation passed in 2000 that amended provisions of the United States Code related to disaster relief.

Their ancestral lands are in the forests of Jun√≠n, Pasco, Hu√°nuco and part of Ucayali in Peru.  Population Ash√°ninka men in house, Acre, 2010 The Ash√°ninka are estimated between 25,000 and 45,000, although others give 88,000 to almost 100,000. Only a few hundred of these live on the Brazilian side of the border. The Ashaninka communities are scattered throughout the central rainforests of Peru in the Provinces of Junin, Pasco, Huanuco and a part of Ucayali, and the state of Acre. Subsistence The Ash√°ninka are mostly dependent on subsistence agriculture. They use the slash-and-burn method to clear lands and to plant yucca roots, sweet potato, corn, bananas, rice, coffee, cacao and sugar cane in biodiversity-friendly techniques. They live from hunting and fishing, primarily using bows and arrows or spears, as well as from collecting fruit and vegetables in the jungle. History Ash√°ninka man with woven palm crown The Ash√°ninka were known by the Incas as Anti or Campa. The Antis, who gave their name to the Inca province of Antisuyu, were notorious for their fierce independence, and their warlike skills in successfully protecting their land and culture against intrusion from outsiders. Ashan√≠nka tribal societies have faced overwhelming obstacles in disputes over territory and culture against the immigrating Spanish culture and neighboring tribal societies .Biodiversity is the establishment of the Ashan√≠nka way of life, so they treat this biodiversity hotspot as their 'natural capital.'In AD 1542 the European settlers pushed to overtake the natural resources .In June 2010, however, the Brazilian and Peruvian governments signed an energy agreement that allows Brazilian companies to build a series of large dams in the Brazilian, Peruvian, and Bolivian Amazon.\\" The problem with the 2,000-megawatt Pakitzapango Dam is that it has a permanent location that is proposed to be located in the heart of Peru's Ene valley could displace as many as 10,000 Ashan√≠nka. These encroaching problems have not only extremely changed the generational culture of the Ashan√≠nka tribal societies, but has also changed landscape of what we call modern-day Peru. Traditional dress The Ash√°ninka traditional dress, commonly known as a kushma , is a robe made from cotton that is collected, spun, dyed and woven by women on looms. Typically the robes are dyed either brown or a bright royal blue. The shoulders of the garments are ornamented with seeds. A full length robe can take up to three months to complete. left Traditionally, women wear their hair long, and over the shoulder, While typically men wear their hair short or in \\"bowl\\" cuts below the ear. Around their necks they wear a large variety of necklaces and bracelets made with seeds, the teeth of tapir, peccary and monkeys, and brightly colored feathers. Ash√°ninka boys with face paint, Acre, 2010 Traditionally the Ash√°ninka men, women and children paint their faces in a variety of designs using the bright red crushed seeds of Achiote (Bixa orellana) (annatto) fruits. For ceremonial purposes, the men also wear woven circles of palm leaves decorated with feathers on their heads, and the women wear a woven cotton head dress. Threats The Ash√°ninka are known historically to be fiercely independent, and were noted for their \\"bravery and independence\\" by the Spanish conquistadors. They resisted with some success missionary endeavors by Roman Catholic missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, especially near the Cerro de la Sal (Salt Mountain) in the central part of the Amazon basin in Peru. During the rubber boom (1839‚Äì1913), the Ash√°ninka were enslaved by rubber tappers and an estimated 80% of the Ash√°ninka population was killed. For over a century, there has been encroachment onto Ash√°ninka land from rubber tappers, loggers, Maoist guerrillas, drug traffickers, colonisers, and oil companies. Malaria is on the rise in Ash√°ninka communities. Current threats (either directly or indirectly) are from oil companies, drug traffickers, colonists, illegal lumberers, illegal roads, and diseases brought by outsiders.

On that date it was redesignated Twenty-Fifth Air Force and aligned as a numbered air force (NAF) of the Air Combat Command.McCullough, Amy, \\"ISR Agency Becomes 25th Air Force\\", Air Force Magazine: Journal of the Air Force Association, November 2014, Volume 97 No. 11, p. 22 Its primary mission was to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) products, applications, capabilities and resources, to include cyber and geospatial forces and expertise. Additionally, it was the service cryptologic component (SCC) responsible to the National Security Agency and Central Security Service for Air Force cryptographic activities. Originally called the United States Air Force Security Service, the Air Force ISR Agency was activated on 20 October 1948, at Arlington Hall, Washington, D.C., with a mission of cryptology and communications security. AFISRA was last commanded by Major General John Shanahan. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant was Chief Master Sergeant Arleen Heath. Both continued in their positions upon the creation of 25 AF. Overview The agency organizes, trains, equips, presents, and deploys assigned forces and capabilities to conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for combatant commanders and the nation. It also implements and oversees the execution of Air Force policies intended to expand ISR capabilities. The agency's 17,000 people serve at about 65 locations worldwide. On 14 July 2014, the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force announced that the Air Force ISR Agency would be reorganized into the Twenty-Fifth Air Force (25 AF), a numbered air force assigned to Air Combat Command, on 1 October 2014.

The service was headquartered at Arlington Hall, a former girls' school and the headquarters of the United States Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS) cryptography effort during World War II. The USAFSS was tasked with the cryptology and communications security missions of the newly formed United States Air Force. The USAFSS moved to Brooks Air Force Base, in San Antonio, Texas, in April 1949, and then to \\"Security Hill\\" at nearby Kelly Air Force Base in August 1953. During the Korean War, the USAFSS personnel provided United Nations Command units with intelligence on the movements of major Korean People's Army forces from Manchuria to Wonsan. USAFSS personnel received Korean Language training at Yale University, and flew on the Douglas C-47 Skytrain to relay communications to allied ground forces on the Korean Peninsula. During the early days of the Cold War, USAFSS crews flew missions on several aircraft converted for intelligence missions, including the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Lockheed C-130A-II Combat Talon, and the Strategic Air Command's Boeing RB-50 Superfortress and Boeing RC-135. The USAFSS established communications stations in Germany, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Scotland, and later installed AN/FLR-9 \\"Elephant Cage\\" radar sites in Alaska, England, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, and Turkey. The USAFSS became involved in the Vietnam War when the Pacific Air Forces asked it to establish an Air Force Special Security Office at Tan Son Nhut Airport near Saigon in 1961. By the following year, a USAFSS squadron and three subordinate detachments were operating in Vietnam and Thailand, and USAFSS personnel supported College Eye threat warning operations. USAFSS crews also flew on Douglas EC-47 Skytrain missions to search for aircrew shot down in North Vietnam and additional SAC RC-135s deployed to Kadena Air Base, Japan. =Electronic Security Command= On 1 August 1979, the Air Force redesignated the USAFSS as the Electronic Security Command (ESC), reflecting the organization's additional mission of improving the Air Force's use of electronic warfare technology in combat. In 1985, the Air Force tasked ESC with computer security, in addition to its intelligence and electronic warfare missions. ESC provided intelligence support to the United States invasion of Panama in 1989 and were among the first U.S. military personnel to arrive in Saudi Arabia for the Gulf War. During that conflict, ESC personnel operated at three different locations in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. =Air Force Intelligence Command= On 1 October 1991, the Air Force redesignated ESC as the Air Force Intelligence Command (AFIC) and consolidated Air Force intelligence functions and resources into a single command. AFIC merged ESC with the Air Force Foreign Technology Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, the Air Special Activities Center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and elements of the Air Force Intelligence Agency, Washington D.C. With the combined missions, AFIC was tasked with intelligence, security, electronic combat, foreign technology, and treaty monitoring. =Air Intelligence Agency= The organization was redesignated again when it became the Air Intelligence Agency on 1 October 1993. During the 1990s, AIA personnel deployed to support NATO operations during the Bosnian War and Kosovo War, and as part of Operations Southern Watch and Northern Watch in Southwest Asia. In February 2001, the Air Force assigned AIA to Air Combat Command, where it provided support to combat operations in the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. =Air Force ISR Agency= In August 2006, General T. Michael Moseley, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, directed that the Air Force intelligence efforts stress intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. AIA was eventually redesignated the Air Force ISR Agency (AFISRA) on 8 June 2007. The organization change included transforming AFISRA into a field operating agency and reassigning it from Air Combat Command to Headquarters Air Force. With the change, AFISRA reported to the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Beginning in 2009, AFISRA personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to support MC-12 aircraft as part of Project LIBERTY. =25th Air Force= In July 2014 the Air Force announced that the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency was being realigned from Headquarters Air Force as a Field Operating Agency to become part of a new operational numbered air force under Air Combat Command. AFISRA became 25th Air Force on 29 September 2014 at a ceremony held at JBSA- Lackland. Chairman of the Senate Armed Forces committee John McCain would later call this move \\"a shell game\\" designed to comply with a DoD requirement to cut excess staff, without actually cutting any positions or saving any money at all. =Lineage= * Established as United States Air Force Security Service on 20 October 1948 : Organized as a major command on 26 October 1948 : Redesignated: Electronic Security Command on 1 August 1979 : Redesignated: Air Force Intelligence Command on 1 October 1991 : Redesignated: Air Intelligence Agency on 1 October 1993 : Redesignated: Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency on 8 June 2007 : Redesignated: Twenty-Fifth Air Force on 29 September 2014 =Assignments= * United States Air Force, 26 October 1948 * Air Combat Command, 1 February 2001 * United States Air Force, 8 June 2007 * Air Combat Command, 29 September 2014 =Components=Wings * 6900th Security Wing, Landsberg AB, Germany, 1 August 1954 ‚Äì UnknownAbstract, Oral History Interview with Lt.

The island is part of the Maatsuyker Islands Group, and comprises part of the Southwest National Park and the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site. The Maatsuyker Island Lighthouse, the southernmost Australian lighthouse, is located on the southern tip of the island.Brothers, Nigel; Pemberton, David; Pryor, Helen; & Halley, Vanessa. (2001). Tasmania‚Äôs Offshore Islands: seabirds and other natural features. Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery: Hobart. The island is part of the Maatsuyker Island Group Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding site for seabirds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Maatsuyker Island Group. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 09/08/2011. Maatsuyker Island is currently inhabited by volunteers, swapped out every 6 months, the improvements on it are being maintained by the Tasmanian Government and volunteer organisations interested in preserving the history of the island and the lighthouse. Flora and fauna The vegetation is dominated by the woody shrub Leptospermum scoparium, or tea tree, which covers most parts of the island, reaching a canopy height of 6 m in sheltered places. Recorded breeding seabird and wader species are the little penguin (700 pairs), short-tailed shearwater (800,000 pairs), sooty shearwater, fairy prion (5000 pairs), common diving-petrel (10,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrel, Pacific gull, silver gull and sooty oystercatcher. The swamp antechinus has been recorded. The island is a haul- out site for the Australian fur seal and a breeding site for the New Zealand fur seal. It is visited by southern elephant seals, which occasionally breed there. Reptiles recorded include the metallic skink, three-lined skink and Tasmanian tree skink. Traffic Access to the island has traditionally been by boat, but today helicopters have almost totally taken over this role. Climate Because the island is so far south and is influenced by circumpolar weather systems, average temperatures are significantly colder than most of Australia. Maatsuyker Island temperatures are around all year with days being cooler and milder. Wind is usually constant. Due to the high vegetation in patches on the top of the island, it is possible to shelter on the \\"jeep trail\\" that runs from the lighthouse to the landing. Several vehicles have been used here over the years, including Suzuki Sierras in the 1980s. Weather observations have been recorded continuously from the island since 1891.

There are both solid-body and hollow body electro-acoustic models available. True electric harps have a solid body versus a hollow body electro- acoustic harp, which can be played either acoustically or electronically. A true electric solid-body harp cannot be played acoustically since it has no hollow soundbox, and must be amplified when played.  Early models  Alan Stivell writes in his book Telenn, la harpe bretonne of his first dreams of electric harps going back to the late 1950s. He designed and had made a solid body (after different electric-acoustic harps) electric harp at the turn of the 1970s‚Äì80s, about the same time as Rudiger Oppermann. Alan Stivell later (early 80s) had a meeting with Joel Garnier who decided to create a model. Alan Stivell went on independently to design and have different single models been made with Leo Goas-Straajer (before the Camac‚ÄìAlan Stivell last experiment). The first such commercially manufactured instrument was made by Camac, also helped later by the request of jazz-pop harpist Deborah Henson- Conant. The result looked like a light framed Celtic-style harp, but each string had a crystal (Piezo) pickup at its base. They can be plugged into various amplification systems, and players are able to use effects pedals similarly to electric guitar players. Another part of Henson-Conant's request was that she should be able to move around the stage with the harp, and thus the smaller electric harps usually include a system to strap the harp to one's body.  Function  Solid-body electric harps are usually lever harps, though solid body pedal harps have also been built. Since the cost of a pedal harp is so high, it is more economical for a harpist to purchase an electro-acoustic model of pedal harp, as it can also be played without amplification. An electro-acoustic harp looks nearly identical to a regular acoustic harp, whether lever or pedal. It has piezo pickups at the base of each string, and some also contain a separate microphone inside the soundbox, enabling the harpist to mix the signals from both kinds of pickups to produce special effects. Often such harps include an onboard preamplifier. One of the most famous electro-acoustic pedal harp models is Camac's \\"Big Blue\\", finished in a striking electric blue colour.

It was implemented in 1952NASA - The Flight of STS-1: Computer for the MIT WHIRLWIND by J. Halcombe Laning and Neal Zierler. It is preceded by the UNIVAC A-2, IBM Speedcoding and a number of systems that were proposed but never implemented. Description The system accepted formulas in a more or less algebraic notation. It respected the standard rules for operator precedence, allowed nested parentheses, and used superscripts to indicate exponents. It was among the first programming systems to allow symbolic variable names and allocate storage automatically. The system also automated the following tasks: floating point computation, linkage to subroutines for the basic functions of analysis (sine, etc.) and printing, and arrays and indexing. The system accepted input on punched tape produced by a Friden Flexowriter. The character set in use at the Whirlwind installation included \\"upper-case\\" (superscript) digits and a hyphen, which were used to indicate array indices, function codes, and (integer) exponents. Like other programming notations of its time, the system accepted only single- letter variable names and multiplication was indicated by juxtaposition of operands. A raised dot was available to indicate multiplication explicitly (the character was created by filing off the lower half of a colon!) The system also included support for solution of linear differential equations via the Runge‚ÄìKutta method. The system was described in an 18-page typewritten manual written for people familiar with mathematics but perhaps unfamiliar with computers. It contains almost nothing in the way of an introduction to computer hardware. Sample program The following example, taken from page 11 of the system's manual, evaluates \\\\cos x for x = 0, 0.1, ..., 1 using the Taylor series expansion. The implementation is not terribly efficient, and the system already includes \\\\cos x in its subroutine library, but the example serves to give a flavor of the system's syntax. Note that division in the system is evaluated after multiplication: 1 x = 0, z = 1 - x2/2 + x4/2¬∑3¬∑4 - x6/2¬∑3¬∑4¬∑5¬∑6 \\\\+ x8/2¬∑3¬∑4¬∑5¬∑6¬∑7¬∑8 - x10/2¬∑3¬∑4¬∑5¬∑6¬∑7¬∑8¬∑9¬∑10, PRINT x, z. e = x - 1.05, CP 1, STOP Applications Few applications were written for the system. One documented application, authored by Laning and Zierler themselves, involved a problem in aeronautics. The problem required seven systems of differential equations to express, and had been given to the Whirlwind because it was too large for MIT's Differential Analyzer to handle. The authors, exploiting the Runge-Kutta feature of their programming system, produced a 97-statement program in two and half hours. The program ran successfully the first time. Influence on FORTRAN Some sources have said that the Laning and Zierler system was the inspiration for FORTRAN. John Backus himself admitted to having contributed to this misconception: > The effect of the Laning and Zierler system on the development of FORTRAN is > a question which has been muddled by many misstatements on my part. For many > years I believed that we had gotten the idea for using algebraic notation in > FORTRAN from seeing a demonstration of the Laning and Zierler system at MIT. > (Backus) After reviewing documentation from the time, Backus learned that the FORTRAN project was \\"well underway\\" when he and his team got a chance to see Laning and Zierler's work: > [W]e were already considering algebraic input considerably more > sophisticated than that of Laning and Zierler's system when we first heard > of their pioneering work ... [I]t is difficult to know what, if any, new > ideas we got from seeing the demonstration of their system.

Rosenberg also examines the influence of Conan Doyle's writings on other works, especially James Joyce's Ulysses. The book argues for a surprising relationship between the Sherlock Holmes stories and Nietzsche, Oscar Wilde, Dionysus, Christ, Catullus, John Bunyan, Robert Browning, Boccaccio, Napoleon, Racine, Frankenstein, Flaubert, George Sand, Socrates, Poe, General Charles George Gordon, Melville, Joyce's Ulysses, T. S. Eliot, and many others. The title comes from lines in William Congreve's The Double Dealer (1694). ::No mask like open truth to cover lies, ::As to go naked is the best disguise. It alludes to Rosenberg's premise that Conan Doyle left clues throughout his works, revealing his innermost hidden thoughts. Rosenberg's book was received with disdain by Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and scholars in the 1970s. It is recognized as the first book of literary criticism about Doyle to appear in print; many other more respected works have followed.

The hotel and courthouse building are registered as California Historical Landmark #663, and located in present-day Calaveras County, California. History George L√©ger, a Frenchman who came during the California Gold Rush, opened his Hotel de France in 1851, as a wood-framed tent. Next door was the Calaveras County Courthouse, as Mokulemne Hill was the county seat at the time. When the county seat was moved to San Andreas in 1866, L√©ger bought the court building and incorporated into his hotel. One reason was that it was made of stone and thus had survived two fires that had ravaged the town previously. After restoration following another fire in 1874, the hotel became known as the Hotel L√©ger, and it has been in operation ever since. The bar, which features a stained-glass back bar with the date 1851 in it, reportedly came around Cape Horn and has been in continuous use. The former courthouse building was also the location of the county jail, and remnants of the jail cells can still be seen in the building's cellar. In popular culture The hotel was refurbished by local volunteers in September 2012 for an episode of Travel Channel's Hotel Impossible series. The episode featuring the hotel aired on January 7, 2013. It was also featured on an episode of Ghost Adventures on June 16, 2018.

(ADB) It is designed to represent combat between vessels of various factions in the Star Fleet Universe, such as the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. The Star Fleet Universe is based upon a licence to use properties in the fictional Star Trek universe as it stood in 1979. Thus it includes the original series and the animated series as well as fan contributions but diverges from then and does not include anything from the movies or any subsequent television series. Much of the combat in Federation Commander is said to take place around the time of the fictional \\"General War\\", a large scale conflict in the Milky Way that involved prolonged conflict between a multitude of star-faring cultures. Federation Commander is largely based on Star Fleet Battles (SFB), and carries over many of its basic rules and game dynamics. It was designed to be a game which would be similar to Star Fleet Battles, but which would provide more ease of learning and playability. It provides a balance between tactical nuance and ease of playability, in order to provide a game which is more accessible for newer gamers, or those with limited time constraints. Some Star Fleet Battles rules were omitted from the game, in order to make gameplay more streamlined, and to eliminate some processes which some players found overly complex. Another motive was to make game rules and dynamics more understandable for new players.  Game rules and dynamics  Combat takes place as two or more players each control one or more starships represented by counters that move across a hexagonally gridded map that may include astronomical features such as stars, planets and asteroids. Players captain their ships by allocating energy to movement and a few specialised systems at the start of each turn. The turn is divided into eight sub-steps called impulses in which movement takes place and additional energy is used to activate weapons, reinforce shields and use other shipboard systems such as transporters. Depending on the capabilities of a ship it is given a particular points value. This value is used to balance game play ensuring that one side does not have an overwhelming advantage over another and can be used to calculate victory points to determine a winner by totalling the value of destroyed or disabled vessels. Scenarios exist that allow variation in the specific winning condition, such as rescuing crew from a crippled ship, gaining sensor information from a planet, escorting a freighter or surviving for a specified number of turns in the face of unbeatable odds. Information about each starship (or base or space monster) is fully contained on ship diagrams (one on each side of a single ship card). Colour-coded boxes over the ship's silhouette represent its weapons, shields, number of shuttlecraft, available warp and impulse power etc. Each starship has one diagram in a more detailed Squadron scale - the kind of scale seen in Star Fleet Battles - and another, more simplified one in Fleet scale - a similar scale to the Cadet scale seen in SFB. (Examples of ship cards in PDF format may be found here.) Ship cards are laminated with plastic so that they may be written upon with erasable markers and reused, obviating the need to photocopy multiple copies of ship information. Both scales use the same rule system, allowing gamers to play a fast-paced duel or starbase assault in Fleet scale, or a more detailed cruiser clash or squadron battle in the aptly titled Squadron scale. A list of questions and answers concerning Federation Commander - and its differences from Star Fleet Battles - is available here. The game uses much of the same mechanisms as Star Fleet Battles, such as power allocation, multiple systems, and ship maneuvering. However, it gets rid of some processes which some found burdensome, such as atmospheric maneuvering, and Marine guards defending aboard ships. Power allocation is handled differently, in that power does not have to be fully allocated at the start of each turn. Players can make new decisions during a turn by using a \\"pay-as-you-go\\" power allocation system, which creates a more realistic feeling of actually commanding a ship.  Game materials  Products for Federation Commander are broken up into a few distinct categories. There are boxed sets that provide everything needed to play including dice and dry-erase pens. \\"Attack\\" products (so named as the product title usually ends with the word \\"attack\\") that supplement the main sets with new ships, scenarios and specialized map board sections. \\"Boosters\\" that provide additional non-random ship cards, mostly duplicates of cards in the boxed or attack product with generally one or two new ship cards per booster pack. = Introductory materials = Federation Commander First Missions includes introductory rules for Federation Commander: Klingon Border, as well as ship diagrams for a Federation CA and a Klingon D7. It is freely available at this link (in PDF format). Federation Commander: Academy is intended as an introductory mission, placed as an intermediate product between the First Missions PDF and the two 'border' supplements. It includes the rulebook from Klingon Border, and details for four starships (The Federation CA, Klingon D7, Gorn BC and Romulan KE) and a map. It is possible to use any of the other FC products with Academy as it has a full rulebook, but the idea is to buy Federation Commander: Graduation, the companion product that provides everything from Klingon Border that isn't in Academy (1\\" counters, mounted mapboards, 14 ship cards). = Boxed sets = Klingon Border is the original set released for Federation Commander It is a complete game that contains a 60-page rulebook, reference play sheets, map boards, several ship cards and two sizes of counters (there are no functional differences in the size, one being larger to include a larger colour illustration of the vessel). It focuses on the Federation and the Klingons as well as including a few Kzinti and Tholian vessels. Vessels include the Federation's United Star Fleet (including the fabled Constitution-class starship portrayed in Star Trek: The Original Series) and the Klingon Empire's Deep Space Fleet (including the famed D7 class battlecruisers, seen serving the Klingon and Romulan Empires in the Original Series) Two ship classes from the Kzinti Hegemony, the Tholian Holdfast's famed Patrol Corvette - the vessel from \\"The Tholian Web\\", an Orion pirate raider vessel, as well as a number of freighter craft, base stations, starbases and a space monster - the feared Planet Killer - are also included. Federation Commander: Romulan Border is a complete set like Klingon Border though with an emphasis on different races. Romulan Border includes ship cards for the Federation and the Romulans with some Gorn ship cards. To lower costs to consumers who already own Klingon Border a version called Romulan Space that eliminates the duplicated materials (the box, map boards and dice and has just the ship and scenario sections of the Romulan Border rulebook) is available. =Expansion sets and booster packs= As the two main boxed sets have all the rules, including some specific rules for empires not seen in that particular set, any of the other supplementary materials of interest can be used. The various Attack products include rules for any new factions included in that set. \\"Attack\\" products * Federation Commander: Klingon Attack is a direct expansion to Klingon Border with 16 additional starships for the races from FC:KB, as well as new scenarios and two new map panels featuring planets. * Federation Commander: Romulan Attack is a direct expansion to Romulan Border with further Romulan, Gorn and Federation ships and two map panels featuring asteroids. * Federation Commander: Tholian Attack concentrates on the Tholians, and introduces the Seltorians to FC with rules for new weapons and the Tholian Web. The two map panels include pre-set web patterns. * Federation Commander: Battleships Attack contains half as many ship cards as normal, but they are double-sized to fit the extra-large ships on them. Also included are the usual counters, scenarios and two new asteroid map panels (different from those in Romulan Attack). * Federation Commander: Orion Attack returned to near the standard product format with 15 ships and a monster as well as counters for ships which appeared in several earlier products like the Briefing #1 and Booster Zero but contains no new map features. The pack concentrated on the operations and opponents of the Orion Pirates, a faction which have been seen since the original Klingon Border. Orion ships are unique in possessing a stealth coating making them harder to hit and in being able to be customised with weapons belonging to any other race (with a few exceptions). * Federation Commander: Distant Kingdoms is similar in format to the \\"Attack\\" products, but introduces several empires 'distant' from the Federation: the Lyran Star Empire and other Lyran factions, Hydran Kingdom, and WYN Star Cluster. Hydran rules allow for the launching of fighter ships, called Stingers, from the larger Hydran ships. Due to the small number of resources on a fighter compared to a capital ship multiple Hydran fighters can be represented on one ship card. * Federation Commander: Hydran Attack expanded the empires (particularly the Hydrans) added by Distant Kingdoms by adding 15 ships, belonging to those new empires (the Lyran Star Empire, Hydran Kingdom, and WYN Star Cluster) as well as including a new monster and ships for some of the older, more well known empires. * Federation Commander: War and Peace introduces the ISC (Inter-Stellar Concordium) who set themselves up as peacekeepers after the \\"General War\\" that racked the other empires; the Vudar, previously a servitor race to the Klingons; the Andromedan Invaders, invaders from the Andromedan galaxy. The Andromedans have the unique property of not using shields for defense but rather energy absorbers prevent damage until they absorb more energy than they can use or dissipate. Due to the additional special rules involved, the Tholian, Hydran and Andromedan empires are considered more difficult for beginners to play. Booster packs Each Border or Attack product contains counters for more ships that are included as ship cards. Federation Commander Booster Packs are small selections of ship cards (6-8) which are associated with a main product. There are three booster packs for each Border or Attack set. The distribution of the cards is fixed. Owning any main Border or Attack set plus all three associated boosters mean a player will have exactly the same number and type of ship cards as the counters in the main set. Boosters typically contain only one or two new ship cards with the remaining cards being duplicates of those in the main product. Currently (February 2011) there are 30 Booster Packs associated with the various main products, as well as Line of Battle, a nearly full-sized product with additional double-sized cards from Battleships Attack, and Booster 91 which includes some iconic ships designed by Franz Joseph (the man who wrote the book upon which the Star Fleet Universe is substantially based). Other products Federation Commander Briefing #1 is a collection of scenarios and ships, many of which had been published places like Captain's Log but had not been in a 'regular' FC product before. Federation Commander Briefing #2 focuses on adding ships from the 'middle years', as the game terms the period of the television series, alongside scenarios from the same period. New scenarios and a selection of ship cards are available from the publisher's website. A series of related miniature box sets are scheduled for release alongside each title release. Due for release alongside Klingon Border was a Federation and a Klingon fleet set, as well as a set containing the other warships, freighters and bases seen in FC:KB. A similar set of box sets, with matching ships for Klingon Attack, Booster Zero, Romulan Border, Romulan Attack and Tholian Attack have also been released. =Future releases= Planned future releases include: Federation Commander: Borders of Madness will include several ships in both starship scales from Star Fleet Battles which will not be included in the main Federation Commander releases, such as the Galactic survey cruisers, scout vessels, commando starships, space control ships (dreadnoughts serving as home vessels for fighter craft and fast patrol craft), and the fabled fighters and carriers. Also, many rules which have been excluded from the main Federation Commander modules will be included for those who wish to use them. In contrast to the step-by-step release schedule for various races in the main line FC sets, each race seen in SFB which will have a representation in Borders of Madness will be included in the first module. As this game is intended for an audience already familiar with SFB, this release will be primarily available from ADB's mail order site. There is no current hard 'plan' on what will be done, or when the product will be worked on, much less released. Some other titles have been reserved for future development, but have not yet been assigned to specific races or scenarios. They are: * Federation Commander: Deep Space * Federation Commander: Next Frontier * Federation Commander: Gorn Attack Online version Federation Commander On-Line is a subscription service which is part of the SFB On-Line service that allows players to play Federation Commander across the Internet.

Career Hammer Damage was founded in 1978, by Mike Hammer and Dave Zagar (a.k.a. Donny Damage) after their split from the Rubber City Rebels. The original line-up included George Cabaniss on guitar, Scott Winkler on bass, Damage on guitar and Hammer on drums. The Hammer Damage Band started out in 1978 and quickly built a strong following in the Akron-Kent music scene. They also enjoyed some modest success in Cleveland, Columbus, Kent and Youngstown. Some of the band's highlights included opening for the B-52's and Public Image Ltd. at the Cleveland Agora, and several shows in New York with the Dead Boys. The band released a couple of singles and appeared on a compilation albums of Ohio bands. After some extended trips to New York and Los Angeles, and several line-up changes, the band finally fizzled out around 1984. Hammer Damage contributed a song, \\"Noise Pollution\\" to the Bowling Balls From Hell II LP on Clone Records. Hammer Damage were one of the three bands profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary, If You're Not Dead, Play, along with Chi-Pig and Unit 5.

It includes both fictional tropical cyclones, and real ones used as the basis for a fictional work, and has proven to be of enough interest for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\\"NOAA\\") to maintain a webpage on the topic. Purpose in fiction and literature Although many forms of natural disaster appear in fiction and literature, tropical cyclones serve a number of useful literary functions because they are both extraordinarily powerful and, to those who have some experience with them, their occurrence can be portended several days in advance. The NOAA page notes that: The strength of the tropical cyclone has made it a device by which authors explain the upending of characters' lives, and even transformations of the personalities of those who live through such an event. Their somewhat hazy predictability also makes them a useful MacGuffin, an impetus for characters to set to action. In some instances, the storm provides cover for characters to engage in covert behavior. Early history of tropical cyclones in literature One of the earliest uses of a tropical cyclone as a plot device occurs in a William Shakespeare play, The Tempest, first performed in 1611 or 1612. There, a storm (raised by the sorcerer Prospero) blows key characters to the island to which Prospero had been exiled many years before. The theme is said to have been inspired by Shakespeare's knowledge of a real-life hurricane which had caused the shipwreck of the Sea Venture in 1609 on the islands of Bermuda, while sailing toward Virginia. Edgar Allan Poe, in his 1841 story, \\"A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m\\", has the main character describe how \\"the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens\\" forced the boat manned by himself and his brothers into a gigantic whirlpool.Wikisource: A Descent into the Maelstr√∂m. The trauma of surviving the storm and the whirlpool (and seeing the death of his brothers) is asserted to have a profound effect on the character, causing his hair to turn white. However, since the story is asserted to occur off the coast of Norway, it is unlikely that the event described could have fallen within the formal definition of a hurricane, as such storms form almost exclusively in the Maritime Tropical air masses of tropical regions of the globe. Joseph Conrad, in his acclaimed 1903 book Typhoon, uses a tropical cyclone as a more direct element of the story, centering the plot on a ship captain's stubborn insistence on going into the heart of such a storm. Fictional tropical cyclonesWorks predominantly focused on the occurrence of a fictional tropical cyclone=Books and plays *(Unnamed): A High Wind in Jamaica (U.S. title: The Innocent Voyage). In this 1929 novel by Richard Hughes, horrific incidents are described from a child's point of view, beginning with the destruction of the family's house by a hurricane. \\"If Emily had known this was a Hurricane, she would doubtless have been far more impressed, for the word was full of romantic terrors....\\" *(Unnamed): In Hazard, a 1938 novel by Richard Hughes. A single-screw turbine cargo steamer encounters a hurricane off the coast of Cuba. Reviewers compared it to Joseph Conrad's Typhoon, admired the weather descriptions, complained of \\"puppet-like\\" characters. *(Unnamed): The Mystery of the Double Double Cross A 1982 novel by Mary Blount Christian prominently features a hurricane hitting Galveston, TX. *Tropical Storm Barney: The name of an artificially enhanced tropical storm that strikes Barbados with winds in excess of in opening of the novel, Category 7: The Biggest Storm in History. The authors describe the storms sudden intensification as \\"...bloated menacing clouds exploding over the open ocean with the unholy force of a mid-air detonation.\\" This description is the books leitmotif for a manipulated storm. *Hurricane Claude: A team of scientists try to use an EMP burst to destroy a Category Two hurricane following a track similar to that of the Long Island Express. Preceded by Hurricane Barbara. *Hurricane Faith: Category Five Cape Verde hurricane which hits New York City with full force, causing a storm surge that topples the Statue of Liberty and inflicts severe damage on the rest of the city.

Reference is also made in the novel to Hurricane Ione as proof of the difficulties of forecasting a hurricanes course. Preceded by Hurricane Laura. *Maria: The name of the storm in George R. Stewart's bestselling 1941 novel, Storm. Although not, strictly speaking, a hurricane, the storm is highly notable for receiving a woman's name, the first widely known example of such personification. In the novel, a character referred to only as \\"the Junior Meteorologist\\" gives storms women's names as a private mental game. Stewart said that he was inspired by reading that \\"a certain meteorologist had even felt storms to be so personal that he had given them names.\\" Stewart's book in turn inspired Lerner and Loewe's song \\"They Call the Wind Maria.\\" It is widely thought to have influenced U.S. Navy meteorologists, who gave female names to Pacific tropical storms during World War II. *Hurricane Omega: The name of a Category Five hurricane threatening the east coast of the United States that is deflected by moving the jet stream. *Hurricane Simone: The name of an artificially created storm that threatens to hit New York City with a strength of above Category Five in the novel, Category 7: The Biggest Storm in History.

According to the 2001 census of Nepal, 17% of the tribe follow the Kirant religion and adopt the Mundhum (Kiranti) culture. The Kiranti-K√µinchs number 55,752. The term ‚ÄòK√µinchs‚Äô is also the name of the mother tongue. Other terms like Mukhiya or Mukhia are exonyms of the tribe. Sunuwar have their distinct language, religion, culture and social customs. They inhabit the eastern hills of Nepal and Himalayan. They are concentrated along the Molung Khola, Likhu Khola and Khimti Khola (‚ÄòKhola‚Äô Indo-Aryan Nepali etymon ‚Äòrivulet‚Äô) regions. By administrative division, they dwell in Okhaldhunga, Ramechhap and Dolakha districts of Nepal, politically known as Wallo (‚ÄòNear/Hither‚Äô), Kirant (in the past and also in use among the Kirantis at present) after the fall of the Kirant dynasty (ruling for about 1903 years and 8 months) at the ancient Nepal valley. Wallo Kirant in the past was their Kipat or communal land.  Lifestyle  Most Sunuwar practice agriculture (approximately 55%). They do so throughout the eastern hills of present-day Nepal and India. Crop cultivation and cattle farming (rice, millet, wheat, soybean, potato, and corn) are the main agricultural works. Sunuwar people also took part in the Second World War and were known as Gorkhali fighters, as well as honest. Some Sunuwar still join the Nepal Army, Indian Army, Singapore Police Force and British Army.  Traditional cultures  Lunar month Sunuwar are very rich in culture and traditions. They have hundreds of traditional feasts and festivals with complex rituals and rules. Every traditional feast or festival has its own objectives, characteristics, and system of celebration. Some festivals, such as Chandi Dance in Baisakh Purnima, Sakela (Shyadar-Pidar), Gil puja (Gil-Pidar), and Meserani puja (Meserani-Pidar), are considered more important than others.

Tihar is analogous to the Indian festival of Diwali, the festival of lights, but with some significant differences. Like with Diwali, Tihar is marked by lighting diyas inside and outside the home but unlike the Indian festival, the five days of Tihar include celebration and worship of the four creatures associated with the Hindu god of death Yama, with the final day reserved for people themselves. According to the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with Kaag (crow) Tihar on Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha (the 13th day of the waning moon) and ends with Bhai (brother) Tika on Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year. In the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls sometime between October and November every year. In the year 2020, Tihar begins on 13 November 2020 and ends on 16 November 2020. Nepal's various communities celebrate Tihar in different ways. The festival is popularly known as Swanti among the Newars and as Deepawali among Madhesis. Khas-Arya Nepalis and Nepalis in the Terai plains make patterns on the floors of living rooms or courtyards using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower petals, called Rangoli, as a sacred welcoming area for the gods and goddesses, particularly Lakshmi. Firecrackers are often set off during the festival, although the Nepal government has placed a ban on the use of firecrackers in recent years citing increasing cases of injury. Children also go from house to house, singing songs and asking for gifts in the form of money and foodstuff. Gambling in the form of cards, kauda (a game of cowrie shells), or langur burja (known as jhandi munda in India) are popular pastimes during the festival. Tihar is the second biggest Nepali festival after Dashain, and is usually allocated a three-day- long national holiday. The festival is novel in that it shows reverence to not just the gods, but also to animals such as crows, cows, and dogs that have long lived alongside humans. Kaag Tihar (Day 1) The first day of Tihar is called Kaag (crow) Tihar. Crows and ravens, believed to be the messengers of the death god Yama, are worshiped with offerings of grains, seeds, and sweets placed on the roofs or out on the streets. The cawing of crows and ravens is associated with sadness and grief in Hinduism as these birds are believed to carry messages from Yama. By feeding the crows, devotees hope to appease them and ward off death and grief for the coming year Kukur Tihar (Day 2) 163x163px The second day is called Kukur (dog) Tihar, also called Khicha Puja by the Newars. On this day, all dogs, whether pets or strays, are offered treats and worshipped by placing a tika on their forehead and garlands of marigolds around their necks. This day marks the special relationship between humans and dogs, where dogs are thanked and celebrated for their loyalty, service and companionship. Dogs occupy a special place in Hinduism, not just as loyal companions but also as messengers of Yama and incarnations of the god Bhairava. In the Hindu epic The Mahabharata, the five Pandavas are followed by a dog as they ascend to Svarga, the abode of the gods. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, watches as his four brothers and wife all fall along the way until it is only the dog that loyally follows him. At the gates of Svarga, Yudhishthira refuses to enter without the dog, who reveals himself to be the god Yama. Thus, the ancient bond between man and dog is established in the Mahabharata. As mentioned in the Mahabharata, Bhairava, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva, had a dog as a vahana (vehicle). Yama, the god of death, is believed to own two guard dogs ‚Äì each with four eyes. The dogs are said to watch over the gates of Naraka, the Hindu concept of Hell. Owing to this belief, this day is also observed as Naraka Chaturdashi. Kukur Tihar has since acquired widespread popularity on the internet and in 2016, was even adopted by a Mexican animal rights group for a similar celebration in Mexico City. Gai Tihar and Lakshmi Puja (Day 3) marigolds being prepared for the decoration. Houses, offices and commercial complexes are decorated with garlands in the morning of Laxmi Puja.166x166px Goddess 233x233px The morning of the third day is called Gai (cow) Tihar. The cow is an especially important animal in Hinduism and is considered sacred. The cow is the vahana of the goddess of wealth Lakshmi and is thus also associated with prosperity. Hindus revere the cow as a particularly docile animal that gives a lot more than it takes. The cow produces milk, cheese, ghee, urine and dung. While the first three can be eaten, the urine is believed to have beneficial effects and the dung is burned as fuel or used as fertilizer. Thus, on the third day of Tihar, Nepali Hindus people show their gratitude to the cow by feeding them treats and worshipping them with tikas and garlands. The third day is also considered the most important day of the Tihar festival. Lakshmi, the patron goddess of the festival, is welcomed into homes that have been cleaned and the doorways and windows decorated with garlands made out of marigolds. Diyas are put up all around the home, especially in doorways and windowsills, while electric lights are draped over houses in the belief that the goddess will not visit dark homes. A special puja is offered to Lakshmi in the evening, wishing for wealth, prosperity and good health. In the evening, young girls go around the neighborhood, singing and dancing in a tradition called bhailo. They are offered small amounts of money and food as rewards for the entertainment they provide. Fireworks are also common on this particular day. Cow dung during Gobardhan PujƒÅ Govardhan Puja and Mha Puja (Day 4) Applying the Tika The fourth day of Tihar is called Govardhan Puja, where the ox is worshipped and celebrated. The ox is seen as an analogue to the cow in Hinduism, as the ox provides manual labor, especially important for an agricultural country like Nepal. Vaishnav Hindus also perform Govardhan Puja, which is worship towards the holy Govardhan mountain. A pile of cow dung is taken as representative of the mountain and worshiped. The fourth day of Tihar also generally coincides with the first day of the Nepal Sambat calendar and thus, is the celebratory Mha Puja for the Newa community, Mha Puja is a unique tradition where the self and the soul within is worshipped. Bhai Tika (Day 5) The fifth and last day of Tihar is called Bhai Tika or Kija Puja in Nepal Bhasa. On this final day, which is celebrated with much fanfare across the country, brothers and sisters mark their special bond by worshipping each other. Legend goes that the when the goddess Yamuna's brother fell mortally ill, Yama the god of death came to take his soul. Yamuna pleaded with the death god to wait until she had finished her final puja for her brother. She then embarked on a long elaborate ceremony that grew to include Yama. Yamuna then asked Yama to not take away her brother until the tika on his forehead had faded, the water she had sprinkled on him had dried and the marigold garlands she had put around his neck had wilted. Thus, on the fifth day of Tihar, sisters create a protective barrier of holy water and blessed oil around their brothers, circumambulating them several times. A special garland made out of the makhmali flower (Gomphrena globosa) is placed around the brother's neck as this flower is known for its long life. The tika placed on the forehead of the brother is also unique in that it consists of seven different colors. The tika is also placed on the sister's forehead by the brother. The ceremony is performed regardless of whether the brother is older or younger than the sister and first or second cousins are also eligible for the ceremony. At the end, the brother touch the feet of their sisters with their forehead, signifying love, respect and devotion. The brothers receive a variety of cooked food such as sel roti, fruits and packaged food while the sisters receive cash or other gifts such as clothing. In addition to these, Newars make colourful Ashtamangala mandalas and recite chants and procedures in accordance with Tantric rituals.

For a long period, they were perceived as flagships of the DB rolling stock.  Development  In the decades following World War II, the Deutsche Bundesbahn focused on purchasing a large number of standardised electric locomotives. The goal was to promote the electrification program and to replace older types of electric locomotives. A maximum speed of was deemed sufficient. With growing economic prosperity, competition with other means of transportation, especially automobiles, was increasing. During the 1950s, plans were made to enhance pre-war Class E 19 locomotives to have a top speed of , but the technical layout was out-dated and the braking system was deemed inefficient. The plans were revised to demand a top speed of , combined with a Co‚Ä≤Co‚Ä≤ wheel arrangement to limit the axle load to 18 tons. Elements of the new class, such as high speed bogies, were tested with existing Class E 10 units.  Prototypes  E03 001 during a locomotive parade at the DB Museum, Koblenz, May 2006 Four prototypes were finished in 1965. They were introduced to the public at the Internationale Verkehrsausstellung (international transport fair) in Munich in June 1965 as Class E 03 (Class 103.0 after the introduction of the new numbering system). During exhibition runs to Augsburg they reached 200 km/h on a regular basis. The experience gained on these occasions indicated that the installed power of (continuous ‚Äî one hour) was insufficient. In addition to stronger motors the transformer was also reinforced for serial production.  Serial Type  The first serial type Class 103.1 was put into service 27. May 1970. DB planned to introduce a new Intercity system with fast first class connections between major cities in autumn of 1971, so the specification sheet demanded Class 103.1 to be capable of pulling a train at . With a total number of 145 units Class 103.1 became the backbone of German Trans Europ Express and InterCity lines. Starting with 103 216, the locomotive body was extended by in order to provide more space in the driver's cab. In addition to the usual Sifa and PZB, Class 103 was also equipped with the LZB as an additional train safety system for speed in excess of . The so-called Automatische Fahr- und Bremssteuerung (AFB) (automatic speed and brake control) automatically kept the train's speed constant at any chosen speed.  Service  With inauguration of the new InterCity system only few lines' construction was enhanced for a top speed of , and the necessary government approvals for speeds higher than was also missing. Therefore, Class 103 in the first years did not reach its top speed in regular service. An accident furthermore delayed the introduction of regular top speed services, as on 21 July 1971 the AFB on 103 106 was suspected to be responsible for accelerating the train out of control, resulting in a derailment with 23 dead and 121 injured. In 1979, a second class was added to the InterCity system, which became widely popular. By that time the top speed of was permitted on lines with the necessary features, and the technical problems had been overcome. Now the major challenge for Class 103 was to pull the heavy trains at these high speeds. Until 1987 (introduction of class 120), Class 103 had a near monopoly for high speed trains in Germany. By the early 1990s, the intensive utilisation resulted in an increasing number of defects. This tendency was intensified by the fact that DB significantly cut back on maintenance. With the first InterCityExpress commencing service in 1991, Class 103 was no longer DB's flagship. Considering wear and tear, DB decided to replace these locomotives with the new Class 101, which entered service in 1996. In the following years, Class 103 was relegated to lesser duties, but the locomotive had not been designed for frequent stops, so wear increased at an even quicker pace. After a brief comeback in 1998, when all InterCityExpress units were temporarily taken out of service after the Eschede train disaster, the remaining Class 103 units were retired from regular service by 2003. However, on 19 March 2013, these preserved Class 103 locomotives returned to daily services from Munich, wearing their original Inter City livery.

Dolpo ( ) is a high-altitude culturally Tibetan region in the upper part of the Dolpa District of western Nepal, bordered in the north by China.. Part of the region lies in Shey Phoksundo National Park. The sparse, agro- pastoral population, known as Dolpo in standard Tibetan and Dhol-wa in the local dialect, is connected to the rest of Nepal via Jufal airport, which can be reached in three days by horse. There are no precise population numbers for the region, with estimates including less than 5,000 and 18,000 The Dolpo are generally adherents of Bon, a religion whose origins predate Buddhism but whose modern form is officially accepted as a fifth school of Tibetan Buddhism. The remote region has preserved its Tibetan culture in relatively pure form, making it attractive to Westerners. Dolpa was the location for the 1999 Oscar-nominated film Himalaya and more recently for the German documentary Dolpo Tulku. In spite of the near inaccessibility of the region and tourism restrictions for the more remote parts, Dolpa is a popular destination for trekking tourism. Geography Dolpo is geologically part of the sedimentary Tibetan-Tethys zone. It is surrounded by Himalayan mountain chains including the Dhaulagiri (). These cloud barriers cause a semi-arid climate, with reported annual precipitations of less than . Chorten with barley fields; Tarap Valley in the southern part of Dolpa. The region is historically divided into four valleys: Tsharka (\\"good growing-place\\"), Tarap (\\"auspicious excellent\\"), Panzang (\\"abode of monks\\"), and Nangkhong (\\"innermost place\\"). They constitute four of the seven village development committees (VDCs) that were created in 1975. The valleys south of the watershed drain into the Bheri River. The VDCs in this area are (roughly from east to west): * Chharka (Tsharka Valley) * Mukot * Dho (Tarap Valley) * Phoksundo. The northern valleys between the watershed and Tibet drain westward by the Langu River, a tributary of the Karnali River via the Mugu Karnali. The VDCs in this area are: * Tinje (Panzang Valley) * Saldang (Nangkhong Valley) * Bhijer.Map of Nepal ‚Äì Dolpa District. Dolpo can be roughly divided into four valleys, each of which is represented since 1975 by a village development committee (VDC): Dho (Tarap Valley), Saldang (Nankhong Valley, the most populous), Tinje (Panzang Valley), and Chharka (Tsharka Valley). There are also smaller VDCs at Bhijer, Mukot and Phoksundo.Discover Dolpa Region - Great Himalayan Trail . Agriculture is possible at heights of (villages of Shimen Panzang Valley and Chharka, respectively) but often requires irrigation. Apart from barley, crops include buckwheat, millet, mustard, wheat, potatoes, radishes, and spinach. Similar to transhumance in the Alps, the population migrates between villages and high-lying () summer pastures, in a lifestyle referred to as samadrok (roughly \\"farming nomads\\"). Dolpo makes up the greatest part of the area of the Dolpa District, but the district's population is concentrated in the lower southern parts, where also most of the VDCs are located. Trade Local products are not sufficient to guarantee survival. The Dolpo traditionally trade salt from Tibet to the lower parts of Nepal, where they maintain netsang (literally \\"nesting place\\") relationships, first described by Kenneth M. Bauer. According to Bauer, each family in Dolpo has netsang partners in most villages of Dolpo District, a network that facilitates travel as well as trade. In return for salt, the netsang provide grain and shelter. The netsang partners trade with each other on preferential terms, based on fictitious family relations that may last for several generations. Recent changes such as the easy availability of salt from other regions and the closed border with Tibet have put the netsang system under pressure. History Dolpo appears in historical records since c. 8th century. In the time from the 6th century to the 8th century the Tibetan Yarlung dynasty conquered most Tibetan-speaking territories. This seems to have caused a southward migration towards Dolpo and the peripheral areas along the upper Kali Gandaki River (Lo and Serib). In 842, Tibet fell apart, and Dolpa fell under the kingdom of Purang. Purang and Dolpa became temporarily part of the kingdom of Guge in the 10th century, but soon became separate again when King sKyid lde Nyi ma mgon divided Guge among his three sons. During the reign of the Ya-rtse king A-sog-lde around 1253 both Dolpo and Serib were lost to the ruler of Gungthang, mGon po lde. The latter then reunited both the Dolpo and Serib and classified them among one of three provinces of mNga' ris. It is also known from historical documents that Mongolian troops reached Dolpo to conquer this province when they conquered many parts of Tibet and finally handed over the power to the ruler of the Sakya period. In the 14th century Dolpo fell under its eastern neighbor the Kingdom of Lo, which controlled the trans-Himalayan trade route through the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The Dolpo had to pay tax and travel to Lo Monthang to provide manual labor. For some time between the 15th century (1440?) and the 16th century, Dolpo was temporarily independent and ruled by a king from the Ra nag dynasty. In 1769, the Gorkhas conquered Kathmandu and established the Kingdom of Nepal, which would soon reach more or less the country's modern extent. In 1789, Nepal swallowed the Lo kingdom and with it Dolpo. The kingdom's attempt to wrest nominal suzerainty over Tibet from China ended in a massive Chinese intervention that left Nepal paying tribute to China. The region in film The 1999 French-Nepalese movie Himalaya, which gives insight into the local customs, was the first Nepalese film to be nominated for an Oscar award and also a huge success in Nepal itself, drawing the country's attention to the region. Kenneth M. Bauer notes that the film's authenticity was in large part artificial, as dialogues mixed the standard Tibetan of the professional actors with the villagers' local dialects and all external influences in the region (such as clothes, Maoists and tourists) were hidden. He also describes the impact which the film had on the region as an employer. The 2009 documentary Dolpo Tulku accompanies Sherap Sangpo (born 1981 in the Tarap Valley) on his journey from India back to his home region and his first steps as a Buddhist spiritual leader of the Dolpa. At the age of ten, he had pilgrimaged to India and after meeting the Dalai Lama had decided to become a monk. In Ka-Nying Monastery in Kathmandu he was soon recognized as the reincarnation of Lama Nyinchung and sent to Namdroling Monastery in Karnataka. After 16 years in southern India his education was finished, and in 2008 he returned to his home region to take over the responsibilities of his predecessor as a Buddhist spiritual leader of the Dolpa and in particular the monasteries in Dho-Tarap, Namgung and Saldang.dolpa tulku ‚Äì film website.

Before the Puja, the puja materials should be washed and kept clean and ready in the puja place. You can select a place for the puja, depending on the number of people you are going to call. The puja should be done facing east or west. A carpeted area covered with a clean, washed cloth like a bed sheet, can be used; unless there is going to be the Havan (Homam) ceremony, in which case a fire-resistant floor is preferred.

Metrication in Canada began in 1970 and ceased in 1985. While Canada has converted to the metric system for many purposes, there is still significant use of non-metric units and standards in many sectors of the Canadian economy and everyday life today. This is mainly due to historical ties with the United Kingdom, the traditional use of the imperial system of measurement in Canada, proximity to the United States, and strong public opposition to metrication during the transition period.Canadians rebel against metric systemA Canadian compromise between metric and imperial Before conversion Until the 1970s, Canada traditionally used the Imperial measurement system, labelled as \\"Canadian units of measurement\\" under Schedule II of the Weights and Measures Act (R.S., 1985, c. W-6). These units have the same name and, with the exception of capacity measures such as the gallon, the same values as US customary units. For example, before metrication in Canada, gasoline was sold by the imperial gallon (about 4.55 litres). In cross-border transactions, it was often unclear whether values quoted in gallons, etc. were referring to the US values (3.79 litres) or the imperial values of these units. The fact that a higher price was being charged did not always resolve the matter. Conversion process The Liberal federal government of Pierre Trudeau first began implementing metrication in Canada in 1970 with a government agency dedicated to implementing the project, the Metric Commission, being established in 1971. By the mid-1970s, metric product labelling was introduced. In 1972, the provinces agreed to make all road signs metric by 1977. During the Labour Day weekend in 1977, every speed limit sign in the country was changed from mph to km/h. From the same time every new car sold had to have a speedometer that showed speed in km/h and distance in km. The distances on road signs were changed to kilometres during the next few months. Gasoline pumps changed from imperial gallons to litres in 1979.https://usma.org/metrication-in-other- countries#canadahttps://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/06/archives/metric-road-signs- due-in-canada-today-some-confusion-is-likely.html There was some resistance to metrication, especially as the sectors of the economy where the federal Weights and Measures Act required metric to be used grew in number. The metrication of gasoline and diesel fuel sales in 1979 prompted 37 Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament to open a \\"freedom to measure\\" gas station in Carleton Place, Ontario, selling gas in both imperial gallons and litres. The city of Peterborough, Ontario, was a noted hotbed of opposition to metrication, having been one of the government's three test centres for the metrication process. Bill Domm, a Member of Parliament representing the riding of Peterborough, was one of the country's most outspoken opponents of metrication. During this period, a few government employees lost their jobs for their opposition to metrication. Neil Fraser, an official with Revenue Canada who publicly opposed mandatory metric conversion, was dismissed for \\"conduct unacceptable for a public servant\\". =Changeover= A long-ago metricated speed-limit sign in Bolton, Ontario, with the old \\"25 mph\\" value now showing through the 40 km/h limit Since 1976, the law requires that all prepackaged food products must declare their mass or their volume in metric units, though Canadian imperial units are still legally permitted on packaging.Food Labelling for Industry Milk has been thoroughly metric since 1980. In April 1975, Fahrenheit temperatures were replaced by Celsius. In September 1975, rainfall was first measured in millimetres and snow in centimetres. Since April 1976, wind speed, visibility, and barometric pressure have been in metric units, with the pressure in kilopascals instead of the hectopascals (millibars) used in most of the rest of the world. In September 1977, every speed-limit sign in the country was changed from miles per hour to kilometres per hour. =Metrication stalled= The election of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in 1984 resulted in the abolition of the Metric Commission on March 31, 1985. This ended the process of affirmative metrication in Canada, and some regulations requiring metric measurements either have been repealed or are no longer enforced. Training on metric conversion was not universal. Poor metrication training was a contributing factor to Air Canada Flight 143, the so-called Gimli Glider, running out of fuel mid-flight on July 23, 1983. Notwithstanding the end of officially sanctioned metrication in Canada, most laws, regulations, and official forms exclusively use metric measurements. However, imperial measures still have legal definitions in Canada and can be used alongside metric units. Net quantity declarations on prepackaged products sold to consumers may be stated in metric units. Common usage todayDaily usage= Canadians typically discuss the weather in degrees Celsius, purchase gasoline in litres, observe speed limits set in kilometres per hour (km/h), and read road signs and maps displaying distances in kilometres. Cars have metric speedometers and odometers, although most speedometers include smaller figures in miles per hour (mph). Fuel efficiency for new vehicles is published by Natural Resources Canada in litres per 100 kilometres, (not kilometres per litre as a direct equivalent of miles per gallon) and miles per (imperial) gallon.https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/transportation/cars-light- trucks/buying/7483 Window stickers in dealer showrooms often include \\"miles per gallon\\" conversions. The railways of Canada such as the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific as well as commuter rail services, continue to measure their trackage in miles and speed limits in miles per hour (although urban railways including subways and light rail have adopted kilometres and kilometres per hour)https://web.archive.org/web/20120825070252/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/rules- tce31-98.htm. Canadian railcars show weight figures in both imperial and metric. Canadian railways also maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length and height in feet and captivity in tons. Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. The use of the metric and imperial systems varies according to generations. Newborns are measured in metric at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Although Canadian driver's licences give height in centimetres, many Canadians also use imperial units to indicate height and weight. Most kitchen appliances in Canada are labelled with both degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, and metric cooking measures are widely available; but Fahrenheit is often used for cooking, as are imperial cooking measurements, due to the import of kitchen appliances and recipes from the United States. Canadians also occasionally use imperial temperatures outside of the kitchen, such as when measuring the water temperature in a pool. Stationery and photographic prints are also sold in sizes based on inches and the most popular paper sizes, letter and legal, are sized in imperial units, though many agendas and notebooks are sold in ISO 216 sizes. Canadian football games continue to be played on fields measured in yards (with a gridiron layout with a length of 100.6 metres, or 110 yards, from one goal line to the other); golfers also expect courses to be measured in yards. =Experience= The use of metric or imperial measurements varies by age and region. Canadians who have received only metric instruction in school (from the early 1970s) are more familiar with metric measurements. Quebec has implemented metrication more fully. The use of imperial units is more common in rural areas than in the rest of the country, where opposition to metrication was strongest, rather than in urban areas. Canadians are exposed to both metric and imperial units, and it is not unusual for there to be references to both metres and feet, square metres and acres, or grams and ounces in the same conversation. =Temperature= Despite the exclusive use of degrees Celsius in weather reports, some Canadians still use Fahrenheit. Most outdoor thermometers display temperatures in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. Additionally, outdoor signs usually display Celsius with occasional references to Fahrenheit. Inside newer buildings, digital and analog thermostats display temperature settings in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Environment Canada still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units.Environment Canada weather in imperial units and Environment Canada weather in metric units =Products and retail= Many food and retail products are sold according to metric units, though this is not always the case. The price of a piece of meat, for example a steak, is typically advertised per pound, but the price printed on the package is per kilogram; the latter is calculated. The prices of fruits and vegetables are usually advertised in pounds, although the price per kilogram is also displayed, usually in smaller type. More expensive items such as deli, meats, and fish are often advertised per 100 grams. Many, but not all, products are sold in imperial sizes, but labelled in metric units. An example of this is butter, which is sold in a 454 gram package (and labelled as such), even though it represents one pound (and in many cases is also labelled with the imperial unit). This is known as \\"soft metric\\" (as opposed to a \\"hard metric\\" system, where packages and measures are generally sold in \\"round numbers\\"; in a hard metric system, butter might come in a 500 g package). Mandatory nutrition facts labelling (the Nutrition Facts Table) uses metric units for several basic nutrients, although serving sizes can be described in any form of unit (can, cup, quantity, etc.). In restaurants, wine is usually served by the litre, or bottle, but a wine glass is measured in ounces. A 750-millilitre bottle of hard liquor is referred to as a \\"twenty- sixer\\" or \\"two-six\\", referring to its volume in imperial fluid ounces, rounded down from 26.4. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing . Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. As in most metric jurisdictions, television sets and computer screens, bicycle frames, and car wheel diameters are usually described in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, tapping, self drilling screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from diameter up to . =Commercial usage= Supermarkets will often advertise foods such as meats and produce \\"per pound\\", and small businesses are exempt from having metric scales and legally sell by the pound. While most supermarket scales display both metric and imperial units,Legal for Trade - Canada products advertised by the pound in a supermarket flyer are invariably sold to the customer (at the point of sale) based on a price \\"per 100 grams\\" or \\"per kilogram\\". Construction materials, including construction lumber and drywall, continue to be sold in imperial measurements; retrofitting metric-sized (designed for 400 mm centres) wallboard on old spaced studs is difficult. In English-speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly (but not exclusively) constructed using imperial units and advertised accordingly, while in French-speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both metric and imperial units as equivalents.Canada: Metric System However, the zoning by-laws and building codes that govern construction are in metric, although most building codes will also contain imperial equivalents. In addition, rural areas in Western Canada (Canadian Prairies) were mapped and segmented using the Dominion Land Survey. This based most rural roads on a mile measurement which when viewed from the air has the appearance of a checkerboard or grid.Google Maps view of southwestern Manitoba, near Brandon Because of this standard now etched into the landscape, it is still common to refer to distance in miles, since counting the number of mile roads is easy. In contrast, in much of southern Ontario the basic survey grid was based on a mile-and-a-quarter (1.25 mi), which corresponds almost exactly to a 2 kilometre grid and which makes miles no more natural than kilometres. 1.25 mi is equal to 100 chains (or 10 furlongs) and it was that sized grid that was used in the original surveys and thus would have been more familiar.The Importance of Title Searches Land Titles vs. Land Registry Free trade with the United States has resulted in continued exposure to the US system. Since the United States is Canada's largest trading partner and vice versa, Canadian exporters and importers must be accustomed to dealing in US customary units as well as metric. =Agriculture= Canada uses an Avery or imperial bushel (36.369 litres) when selling oats, wheat, and other grains. When dealing with the US oat markets though, special attention must be paid to the definition of bushel weight because US uses a Winchester bushel (35.239 litres).Marketing Oats in Canada In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. =Health care= In the health care system, metric units are often given precedence, although actual metric units may still be different than the United States (for example, for measurements of blood cholesterol, the units are millimole per litre, whereas they are milligram per decilitre in the United States). Most physicians chart patient height and weight in imperial units, and while most growth charts display both systems of measurement, the majority of hospitals officially document such parameters in metric.Is My Child Growing Well? Dieticians still use kilocalories, and doctors use millimetres of mercury. While these units are metric derivatives, they are not metric units. =Engineering= Because most fasteners, machine parts, pumps, piping, and all building materials are sold in imperial or US customary units, many mechanical and civil engineers in Canada mainly use imperial units for these items. Overall building dimensions for new construction are usually in SI units. . Many chemical, nuclear and electrical engineers and engineering physicists employ metric units. Unlike in the United States, Canadian engineers are not always educated in both systems but those who are not become keenly aware of the differences between the imperial, metric and US customary systems once they enter the workforce. =Trades= Trades associated with machine work, such as machinists, automotive, and heavy duty technicians, frequently use both metric and imperial. Machines made in Canada often incorporate parts from other countries and thus the finished product may have both metric and imperial parts. Farm and industrial equipment manufactured in Canada will most often use inch system fasteners and structural steel, but fluid capacities are always listed in metric. Building trades such as plumbing and carpentry often use imperial units. Rough timber, drywall, plywood, fasteners, pipes, and tubing are all sold in imperial units. Nails in hardware stores are measured in inches but sold in metric weight packages. Electricians in every country use metric units such as volts and amperes, but motors and engines are still quoted in horsepower. Electric car motors are rated in kilowatts. However, Canada uses, among other things, the US American wire gauge standard instead of the square millimetre (mm2) used in the IEC 60228 standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission. Conduit sizes are in inch diameters, although some manufacturers include the metric size printed on the conduits (for example, , , ). =Firearms= Imperial units remain in common use in firearms and ammunition on the international market. Cartridges may have either commercial or military descriptions. In the former, the manufacturer will choose a name for proprietary reasons, perhaps to associate the name with a brand or designer, or otherwise distinguish it from comparable cartridges. Typical terms include bullet or bore diameter, cartridge length or capacity, a proper name or company. Designs are registered with Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) or Commission internationale permanente pour l'√©preuve des armes √† feu portatives (CIP) for standardization. Canadian industry follows both conventions, but there is no appetite in the Canadian firearms industry or hobby to pursue metrification simply for the sake of conformity when the trade is global. Military designations use technical nomenclature to avoid confusion or misrouting of supplies. There are several examples of similar names and similar design dimensions. For example, the civilian cartridge .303 Savage was introduced by the Savage Arms Company in 1894, but is incompatible with the .303 British used throughout the Commonwealth. The .308 Winchester cartridge derived from the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge in the 1950s, with slight variations in production but not in external dimensions. All four examples are common small arms cartridges in Canada. Imperial measures are often encountered in the description of cartridges, even when the cartridge is of a relatively recent product introduction (e.g. .204 Ruger, .17 HMR, where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). Ammunition which is classified in metric already is still kept metric (e.g. 9 mm, 7.62 mm). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of grains for both metric and imperial cartridges. The popular .30-30 Winchester is a .30 calibre bullet originally loaded with 30 grains of smokeless gunpowder. =Print= Canada uses the inch-based paper standard e.g. the US Letter (8.5 inches √ó 11 inches), rather than the metric-based A4 paper size (210 mm √ó 297 mm) used throughout most of the world. The government, however, uses a combination of ISO paper sizes, and CAN 2-9.60M \\"Paper Sizes for Correspondence\\" specifies P1 through P6 paper sizes, which are the US paper sizes rounded to the nearest 5 mm.\\"Canadian standard CAN 2-9.60M paper sizes\\" =Air transportation= Luggage restrictions and limits at Canadian airports are in metric values with soft imperial conversion values.Carry-On Baggage Runway lengths are given in feet and speed in knots1.8.

Fuel is nowadays measured in metric units. The Gimli Glider incident in July 1983 is a famous case of a kilogram‚Äìpound mistake, in which the miscalculation of the amount of fuel in an Air Canada airplane with a malfunctioning fuel gauge caused the plane to run out of fuel mid-flight. Education regarding the imperial system In 2005, the Ontario government announced changes to the secondary- school mathematics curriculum that would allow imperial units to be taught along with metric units. This marked a departure from previous governments' efforts to make sure that the curriculum used only the metric system. This was done in light of the refusal or reluctance of much of the private sector to metricate; thus students had been leaving school unprepared for the units used in the workplace. Many other provinces and territories also include the imperial system of measurements as part of their educational curriculum.

Although centuries old tradition, modern science has established the fact that child's digestive system is capable of processing solid food when they are approximately six months old which is why Pasni is held for when a baby turns six months old but it can vary between daughters and sons. This ceremony is held at five months for daughters, and six months for sons. An auspicious date and time is chosen by an astrologer, usually a Hindu, and all the closest relatives are invited to witness and to celebrate. The rice is the first and easily digestible solid food a baby eats. This custom varies with the variation of religion, caste and also place. Gurung, Magar serve kheer (rice pudding) which is rice cooked with milk and sugar similarly Brahmin, Kshatris also do same. Whereas myriads of dishes are prepared and served in Newar. The main rice dish is served in one giant (often woven) plate of leaves. The remaining dishes, typically 84, are served around the main dish. Baby is dressed in saffron silk cloth (although modern families will often put a diaper (nappy) on, to minimize accidents.) The baby is held by baby‚Äôs mother while the entire family feed her or him the first taste of rice. It is the mother's right to feed the child first. This is because symbolically, after breastfeeding the child, she is asking the gods to bless the child who is now entering the world of other regular food. Musicians playing traditional music can be invited to start the function at the given auspicious time. After the baby has eaten, she or he will undergo another extensive puja (worship ceremony) often led by a priest and accompanied by chanting from ancient scriptures. For the rest of the day, the baby is dressed in a special outfit, usually made of red velvet and embroidered with silver and golden thread. The child is offered with gifts, money by close relatives, and gold and silver ornaments by grandparents. These ornaments include heavy silver anklets (kalli) carved with dragon at both the ends to keep the bad omens away from baby. These ornaments can be handed on as heirlooms. In some Newari communities, it is also common for sons to have upper lobe of the right ear pierced with gold ornaments with different beads. Pasni ceremonies have become extensively lavish these days, with large parties of not just close relatives, but also colleagues and friends being invited for the event. The guests, numbering in their hundreds, partake in a wedding-style banquet under tents, which are often catered by commercial catering agencies. They also bring gifts for the child, a new custom that has become more popular with the commercial rise of clothes, toys and other gift items targeted towards children. Simpler ceremonies are also performed in temples dedicated to female tantric deities, with only a few relatives in attendance. The ceremony varies from family to family as they incorporate their own long-standing family traditions.

Synopsis  Plot = In 1989, Ernesto Cruz, a deep-cover DEA agent, leads a troop of DEA agents against a militia in a jungle to take some information on Papa Muerte. After the attack, Ernesto is thrown from a plane and killed: his C.O. Colonel Trust believes it's a drug overdose. Ernesto's son Tommy, a high-ranking DEA agent, goes to Mexico and finds Marco, who is his primary contact with Morales Cartel. Tommy destroys a Virgillo gang convoy and their gas station but is seriously wounded by a grenade explosion. With no alternative, Tommy calls his younger brother Ramiro, an imprisoned criminal, to take the job. Ramiro saves Marco from a group of Virgillos who want to kill him because he was winning too much in the game of poker and Marco refers him to Cesar Morales, a local gang boss who had bragged of knowing Ernesto's murderer. Morales sends Ramiro to steal the Virgillo's prized car, only to blow it up. Afterwards, Ramiro is enlisted the task of recovering three stolen trucks that will be used for Morales's trafficking deal. Ramiro successfully steals the trucks, as well as blowing up the Virgillos' ship. Morales's chauffeur Angel overhears Ramiro talking to Tommy, and finds out his identity. Ramiro then accompanies the trucks through Virgillo country, enabling the trucks to pass through: he hides in one of the trucks and follows them to Morales' meat factory. Ramiro opens the gate for the DEA agents, but Morales, aware of his plan, ambushes them: Ramiro narrowly escapes with the help of Angel, who is revealed to be a Mexican undercover police officer. Ramiro infiltrates a meeting of the Virgillos in which he finds out that Morales was just a puppet with someone pulling the strings. Ramiro engages and dispatches Morales' henchmen, finally killing Morales, obtaining a letter from Morales' safe. He finds out that the letter was sent to Morales by a man named PM (probably Papa Muerte). The letter said that PM's DEA informant The Eagle had forewarned him of the DEA ambush. PM had supplied Morales' men with weapons and artillery through Elvez Autos. Ramiro infiltrates Elvez Autos and finds a bunch of papers depicting coffins and enough ammunition for a small army: he infiltrates Elvez's Villa through the sea and finds bodies of DEA agent Pierson and the other agents in coffins. Interrogating Elvez, Ramiro learns that Papa Muerte had ordered him to supply Cesar Morales with guns to get rid of the DEA agents; General Montanez was to deliver the payment and had done so. Ramiro kills Elvez and escapes the villa with the police and the military in pursuit. Ramiro then goes to the jungle to Montanez's military base, extracting information about Papa Muerte and the DEA spy. Ram engages and kills Montanez, escaping the jungle. Trust finds out that Papa Muerte had planned to sneak into the DEA and steal the contraband cocaine which the DEA had seized, leaving a bomb to cover their tracks. Ramiro waits at Angel's apartment for extraction, only to find Papa Muerte's henchmen trying to kill him: meanwhile, Agent Johnson reveals himself as the Eagle and induces Tommy and Trust with a lethal drug overdose, although Tommy is able to patch Ramiro in to hear that Johnson had kidnapped Angel and killed their father. Ramiro returns to the DEA, fighting through Muerte's henchmen to save Tommy and Trust with an antidote while Johnson escapes on an armored train with Angel. Using a locomotive to carry the bomb away, Ramiro pursues and boards Johnson's train. Johnson, separating the coaches from the engine, battles Ramiro until Trust sends air support to destroy a canyon bridge ahead: Ramiro rescues Angel, and they jump over the broken rail on a dirtbike as the train falls into the canyon, dragging a trapped Johnson to his doom.  Gameplay  A screenshot of the game featuring the shot dodge ability Total Overdose is a third-person shooter open world action/adventure game. Players assume control of Ramiro, Tommy and Ernesto. The most playable character in the game is Ramiro, while Tommy and Ernesto can be played only in the two beginning missions. The game parodies Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy. Throughout the game, players can run and dive and have the ability to use weapons including shotguns, rifles, handguns and rocket launchers. While outside the missions the player can explore the open world of the game, but some regions will be available only during certain missions. The game features cheap and special cars. The special cars include \\"Conquistador\\", Orange Dirtbike, Purple and Flame Pickup, Tow Truck, DEA and Military SUVs. Players have the ability to shot dodge, during which the player dives in any direction with a slow motion effect. This move gives players more accuracy in shooting enemies in combat. Loco moves are special attacks which players can pick up by scoring large numbers of points and combo kills. These moves can be used for eliminating heavy and a group of enemies. Players can perform seven different kinds of loco moves: Golden Gun, Tornado, El Toro, El Mariachi, Sombrero of Death, Explosive Pi√±ata and Mad Wrestler/Mysterioso.  Reception  Total Overdose received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.  Cancelled sequel  A sequel was originally planned named Total Overdose 2: Tequila Gunrise. It would have featured the entire map of Mexico, but it was cancelled after Eidos Interactive pulled out of it.

Spartina grass can be seen at the north of the beach. Sand Point is in the background and South Wales in the far distance across the water. Sand Bay is a strip of coast in North Somerset bordered to the south by Worlebury Hill and to the north by Middle Hope and Sand Point. It lies north of the seaside resort of Weston-super-Mare, and across the Bristol Channel from South Wales. It is adjacent to the village of Kewstoke. Coastal details The north end of Sand Bay has become overgrown with spartina grass since the 1950s. This hardy grass was planted to support the banks of a tributary to the Bristol Channel further upstream than Sand Bay. Over the last 20 years the grass has rapidly taken over the north end of the beach and is now beginning to grow in isolated areas of the south end. The grass also began to grow on the beach at Weston-super-Mare, but was removed by the local council. In the 1980s part of the beach at Sand Bay was raised to prevent flooding by pumping sand from the Bristol Channel up onto the beach. The beach now has two levels, one at the original height near the sea and one bordering the adjacent road at the higher level. The upper beach level has now become covered in grass in many areas (not with the spartina grass - which is found at sea level).  Sea water quality  The beach is often littered with tidal-borne material that washes up from the Bristol Channel, and‚Äîlike all other beaches in North Somerset‚Äîit has never received a European Blue Flag. However, since 2005 and 2006 DEFRA has rated the water quality as good. The Marine Conservation Society has 'adopted' the beach and since 1999 has carried out four surveys of the beach annually. A 2004 survey reported that the beach had three times the national average quantity of sewage-related debris, with particularly high numbers of cotton bud sticks.  Holiday destination  A Pontins holiday camp was opened in Sand Bay in 1947, remaining with the company until 1999. During its peak of popularity it had 300 chalets spread over . After Pontins, the site was owned by the Holybush Hotel group under the name of Sand Bay Holiday Village. With cabaret, tea dances, comedy and music, it remains a popular destination. In 2008, The company has rebranded to Martyn Leisure Breaks and is now known as Sand Bay Leisure Resort. In 2013, Martyn Leisure Breaks entered administration and closed the park. In 2014, it was announced that the site would re-open for the 2014 as a Pontins resort once again, now under the ownership of Britannia Hotels. There are several static caravan parks in the Sand Bay / Kewstoke area. Although mainly a holiday destination Sand Bay does also have housing and a population of people who live in the village. Sand Bay has a Bar/Fish and Chip shop, Tea Rooms and a Snack bar with Public Toilets and two Car Parks. First West of England route 1 operates between Sand Bay and Weston-Super-Mare town centre, using open-top buses weather permitting, all year round.

The conversion of measurements‚Äîmetrication‚Äîcommenced subsequently in 1971, under the direction of the Metric Conversion Board and actively proceeded until the Board was disbanded in 1981. Before 1970, Australia mostly used the imperial system for measurement, which the Australian colonies had inherited from the United Kingdom. Between 1970 and 1988, imperial units were withdrawn from general legal use and replaced with SI metric units, facilitated through legislation and government agencies. SI units are now the sole legal units of measurement in Australia. Australia's largely successful transition to the metric system contrasts with the ongoing opposition to metrication in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. History Although there was debate in Australia's first Parliament after federation to consider adopting the metric system, metric units first became legal for use in Australia in 1947 when Australia signed the Metre Convention (or Convention du M√®tre). However, Imperial \\"Weights and Measures\\" were most commonly used until the Commonwealth government began the metric changeover in the 1970s. In 1960, SI units were adopted as a worldwide system of measurement by international agreement at the General Conference on Weights and Measures. The metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin,The kelvin was known as the degree Kelvin at the time. candela and mole were defined as base units in this system and units formed from combinations of these base units were known as \\"derived units\\". SI units were subsequently adopted as the basis for Australia's measurement standards, whereby they were defined as Australia's legal units of measurement. In 1968, a Select Committee of the Australian Senate chaired by Keigh Laught examined metric \\"Weights and Measures\\" and came to the unanimous conclusion that it was both practical and desirable for Australia to change to the metric system. Some of their considerations included the \\"inherent advantages of the metric system\\" that meant that weighing and measuring was facilitated, \\"often with substantial increases in efficiency\\". Educationally, the reform would \\"simplify and unify the teaching of mathematics and science, reduce errors, save teaching time and give a better understanding of basic physical principles\\". In 1968, more than 75% of Australia's exports went to metric countries, and at that time it was noted that all countries (except the United States) were metric or were converting to the metric system. It was also noted that because of Australia's large migrant programme, more than 10 per cent of people over 16 years of age had used the metric system before coming to Australia. They also noted that school pupils were widely familiar with the metric system because it had been taught in the schools for many years. By 1968, metrication was already well under way in Australian industry. The pharmaceutical industry had metricated in 1965, and much of the chemical and electronics industries worked in metric units, as there were no \\"Imperial\\" units for the latter. One of the country's major automobile manufacturers had already declared its intention to metricate before the Government announced its decision to change to the metric system. \\"The change itself provided a unique opportunity to rationalise and modernise industrial practices and bring Australia's technical standard specifications into accord with those adopted internationally\\". On 12 June 1970, the Australian Metric Conversion Act passed by the Australian Parliament was given assent. This Act created the Metric Conversion Board to facilitate the conversion of measurements from imperial to metric. A timeline of major developments in this conversion process is as follows: * 1971 ‚Äì the Australian wool industry converted to the metric system. * 1972 ‚Äì Horse racing converted in August and air temperatures were converted in September. * 1973 ‚Äì all primary schools were teaching the metric system alone: many had been teaching both imperial and metric for some years. All secondary schools were now using the metric system. * 1974 ‚Äì large scale conversion across industries, including packaged grains, dairy products, eggs, building, timber, paper, printing, meteorological services, postal services, communications, road transport, travel, textiles, gas, electricity, surveying, sport, water supply, mining, metallurgy, chemicals, petroleum and automotive services. Most beverages, aside from spirits, also converted to metric units by the end of the year. The conversion of road signs took place in July. There was a publicity campaign to prepare the public.Metric conversion ad‚Äî1974 YouTube. * 1976 ‚Äì the building and construction industry completed its change to metric measurements (within two years) by January. * 1977 ‚Äì all packaged goods were labelled in metric units, and the air transport, food, energy, machine tool, electronic, electrical engineering and appliance manufacturing industries converted to metric. * 1987 ‚Äì the real estate industry, the last major industry holdout, converted to metric. * 1988 ‚Äì with Western Australia finally making the change, metrication was completed, and the metric system became the only system of legal measurements in Australia. = Metric Conversion Board = Opposition to metrication was not widespread. The Metric Conversion Board did not proceed with education programmes as polling revealed that most people were learning units and their application independently of each other, rendering efforts to teach the systematic nature of the metric system unnecessary and possibly increasing the amount of opposition. The Board was dissolved in 1981, but the conversion to the metric system was not completed until 1988. The Board spent A$5.955 million during its 11 years of operation, and the federal government distributed $10 million to the states to support their conversion process. Between 1984 and 1988, the conversion was the responsibility of the National Standards Commission, later renamed the National Measurement Institute in 1988. The cost of metrication for the private sector was not determined but the Prices Justification Tribunal reported that metrication was not used to justify price increases. =Metrication of horse racing= An early change was the metrication of horse racing. This was facilitated because the furlong (one eighth of a mile) is close to 200 m. Therefore, the Melbourne Cup was changed from to , a reduction of or about 0.58%. The first metric Melbourne Cup was raced in November 1972. =Metrication of weather reporting and forecasts= When the Australian Bureau of Meteorology was enlisted to introduce the metric system for weather reporting and forecasts, its public relations officer, Godfrey Wiseman, coined a series of jingles to educate the public, using the terms \\"frosty fives\\", \\"tingling tens\\", \\"temperate twenties\\", \\"thirsty thirties\\" and \\"fiery forties\\" to describe human sensation to temperatures in degrees Celsius. This was very successful because the public soon became aware of the significance of the descriptions. At the culmination of this campaign, weather reports and forecasts in both Imperial and metric measures were provided for one month only. After that, purely metric measurements were used for temperature, wind speed, rainfall, air pressure and other meteorological phenomena. =Metrication of the road signs= An important and very visible sign of metric conversion in Australia was the change in road signs and the accompanying traffic regulations; \\"M-day\\" for this change was 1 July 1974. Because of careful planning, almost every road sign in Australia was converted within a month. This was achieved by installing covered metric signs alongside the imperial signs before the change and then removing the imperial sign and uncovering the metric sign during the month of conversion. While road signs could not all be changed at the same time, there was little chance of confusion as to what any speed limit sign meant during this short change-over period. This was because the previous (MPH) signs had the signage in black on white and were rectangular, in the same style as current US speed limit signs, while the (km/h) signs which replaced them had the number indicating the speed limit inside a red circle, as is done in Europe. Road distance signs were also converted during this period. To avoid confusion as to whether the distance indicated was in miles or kilometres new major distance signs had affixed to them a temporary yellow plate showing the symbol km. (On the many new kilometre signs on minor roads, a yellow plate which showed the corresponding number of miles was affixed under the now permanent kilometre distance indication.) These temporary plates were removed after about one year. Except for bridge-clearance and flood-depth signs, dual marking was avoided. Though people opposed to metrication expressed concern that ignorance of the meaning of metric speeds would lead to slaughter on the roads, this did not happen, as most drivers under the age of 25 had been taught metric units at school and through them, their parents were familiar with metric speeds, if not metric units as a whole. It was believed that public education would be the most effective way of ensuring public safety. A Panel for Publicity on Road Travel, made up of the various motoring organisations, regulatory authorities and the media, planned a campaign to publicise the change. The resulting publicity campaign cost $200,000 and the Australian Government Department of Transport paid for it. The Board also produced 2.5 million copies of a pamphlet, \\"Motoring Goes Metric\\". This was distributed through post offices, police stations and motor registry offices. \\"For about a year before the change, motor car manufacturers fitted dual speedometers to their vehicles and, after 1974, all new cars were fitted with metric-only speedometers. Several kinds of speedometer conversion kits were available. \\"As a result of all these changes, conversion on the roads occurred without incident.\\" =Building and construction= The building industry was the first major industry grouping in Australia to complete its change to metric. This was achieved within two years by January 1976 for all new buildings other than those for which design had commenced well before metrication began. The resulting savings for builders and their sub-contractors has been estimated at about 10% a year of gross turnover.http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/CostOfNonMetrication.pdf Sub Answer 3. 1 In this the industry was grateful to the SAA (now Standards Australia) for the early production of the Standard AS 1155-1974 \\"Metric Units for Use in the Construction Industry\\", which specified the use of millimetres as the small unit for the metrication upgrade. In the adoption of the millimetre as the \\"small\\" unit of length for metrication (instead of the centimetre) the Metric Conversion Board leaned heavily on experience in the UK and within the ISO, where this decision had already been taken.ISO 2848 This was formally stated as follows: \\"The metric units for linear measurement in building and construction will be the metre (m) and the millimetre (mm), with the kilometre (km) being used where required. This will apply to all sectors of the industry, and the centimetre (cm) shall not be used. ‚Ä¶ the centimetre should not be used in any calculation and it should never be written down\\".(Standards Association of Australia \\"Metric Handbook, Metric Conversion in Building and Construction\\" 1972) The logic of using the millimetre in this context was that the metric system had been so designed that there would exist a multiple or submultiple for every use. Decimal fractions would not have to be used. Since the tolerances on building components and building practice would rarely be less than one millimetre, the millimetre became the sub-unit most appropriate to this industry. Although for the most part they are ignored in everyday life, it was not possible for education in the logical construction of the metric system to ignore the metric prefixes deci, centi, hecto and deka, since the derivation of the litre is dependent upon the knowledge that it derives from the volume of a cubic decimetre, i.e. 1000 cubic centimetres. However, in Australia, the prefix \\"centi\\" has been limited to use with the metre (mainly by the general public not associated with the building industry, unlike in Europe, where the centilitre may often be encountered. Extent Metrication is mostly complete. Road signs solely use metric measurements, as do the speedometers and odometers in motor vehicles produced after 1974, but there was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles to have their speedometers and odometers converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles, and privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, do not need to be so converted. The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre, but vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch. Fruits and vegetables are advertised, sold and weighed by the kilogram, groceries are packed and labelled in metric measures. Schooling is wholly metric. Newspaper reports are mostly in metric terms. In some cases old imperial standards were replaced with rounded metric values, as with horse racing or the size of beer glasses (rounded to the nearest 5 mL). The pre-metric names of beer glass sizes, including the pint, have been retained (although in South Australia the \\"pint\\" of beer is not an imperial pint, as it is elsewhere in Australia).ABC News, 'Getting to the bottom of the pint: the bitter problem of Adelaide's beer glasses', 8 September 2017, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-08/curious-adelaide-south- australia-beer-glass-sizes/8874960, accessed 20 May 2019 Dressed timber is often sold in lengths such as 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 3.0 and 3.6 metres, each multiples of 300 mm, thereby approximating foot length increments,http://www.bunnings.com.au/our-range/building- hardware/timber/dressed-timber while pipes and conduits may be specified as having diameters of 12, 19, 25 and 32 etc. mm (based on \\"soft\\" conversions\\" of , , 1 and in). In some cases goods manufactured to pre-metric standards are available, such as some bolts, nuts, screws and pipe threads and there are some instances where pre-metric measures may still be used: * Mass is referred to in kilograms,http://www.jennycraig.com.au/pressrelease.aspx?id=1655 and baby nappy sizes are specified in kilograms only. While some parents may still convert their baby's hospital-stated birth mass to pounds and ounces, the practice of using pre-metric units has become far less common.An example where some birth masses are given in pounds and ounces. *Height is measured and given in centimetres. In informal contexts a person's height is still sometimes stated in feet and inches.At least one Australian internet dating service uses metric units for height with the imperial measurement alongside. * Domestic and commercial real estate is advertised in square metres or hectares. Although crop yields are described in tonnes per hectare, rural land areas are sometimes still advertised in acres. * Weather reports are always in metric terms but some specialised surf reports give wave heights in feet. While Imperial units of measurements may sometimes be specified instead of SI units (usually, where the product originates from or is intended for an American market) apart from area measurements, the use of any measurement except in SI units is not \\"legal for trade\\" under current Australian legislation.https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015C00010 Schedule 6- Permissible units of measurement Examples where non-SI units are (sometimes) specified are: * Aviation, as in many other metric countries, specifies horizontal distances in nautical miles and horizontal speed in knots, but horizontal distance for visibility or clearance from clouds is in kilometres or metres, as are runway dimensions. (The pressure and temperature are also given in SI units, in hectopascals and degrees Celsius respectively). Height or altitude is always specified in feet, as this is vital for safety‚Äîas long as one remaining country in the world does not change to metric measurements. (The error in approximating 1000 feet as 300 metres is 4.8 m/16.75 feet. This may be somewhat insignificant at low altitudes. However, the cumulative effect of this error by 30,000 feet (9.15 km) becomes quite significant (144 m/472 feet) The measurement and vertical speed (rate of climb or descent) is given in feet per minute‚Äîfor much the same reasons height is given in feet. *The altitude for sky diving is routinely given in feet, which follows from the above existing Aviation \\"conventions\\". (However, Scuba diving uses metric measures) * Australia uses metric paper sizes for office use and home printing. (A4 = 210 √ó 297 mm) However, the term dots per inch (dpi) is still used when printing images. The photo printing industry usually uses imperial sizes for photo dimensions (e.g. 4 √ó 6-inch rather than 10 √ó 15 cm). * Historical writing and presentations may include pre-metric units to reflect the context of the era represented. * Vehicle tyres (as in the rest of the world) mark the rim diameter in inches and the width in millimetres. A car tyre marked '165/70R13' has a width of 165 mm, an aspect ratio (profile) of 70% and a 13-inch rim diameter. Tyre pressures may be given in both kilopascals and \\"pounds per square inch\\". * TV screens and LCD monitors may be described in inches instead of or as well as centimetres, e.g., a Plasma screen may be advertised as 42 inches (106 centimetres), and a computer monitor screen may be advertised in inches. *Advertising billboards are measured by feet‚Äîbecause of the still pervading influence of USA practices on such activities. *The illicit drug trade in Australia still often uses imperial measurements, particularly when dealing with smaller amounts closer to end user levels e.g. \\"8-ball\\" an 8th of an ounce or 3.5 g; cannabis is often traded in ounces (\\"oz\\") and pounds (\\"p\\") *Firearm barrel length are almost always referred by in inches, ammunition is also still measured in grain and ounces as well as grams. The cultural transmission of British and American English in Australia has also been noted to be a cause for residual use of Imperial units of measure.

The series was officially launched in 1999, with the models 2.0 GSI, and choices of gasoline, diesel or LPG power, followed by the limited edition SE 2.7 V6, in 2001. Sales began in South Korea in April 1999, and the vehicle arrived to Europe in March 2000. The premiere for the United Kingdom was at the London Motorfair, in October 1999. Overview Hyundai Trajet (rear) 2007 Hyundai Trajet 2007 Hyundai Trajet (rear) The models of the Trajet have three rows of seats. A variety of seating configurations allows for extra luggage space, and the seats can be removed to accommodate larger items. The front seats can rotate through 180 degrees to face the passengers at the back when the car is stationary, and the back seats can also be turned into tables, making a virtual office space, or picnic area. Hyundai stated that Hyundai Starex is not the Trajet's successor, because the Grand Starex is not a minivan. The Kia based Entourage is the closest thing to direct successor, but it is only available in limited number of markets. The Trajet competed in the same market segment as the Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna. Standard equipment for the 2.0 GSI and 2.0 CRTD GSI (diesel version) included driver, passenger and side airbags, ABS with EBD, power steering, seat belt pre tensioners, front and rear air conditioning, electric front and rear windows, stereo RDS radio/CD unit, double folding second and third row seats (the second and third row seats are removable), and sliding outer seats on second row. The price range for the Trajet, for the market in the United Kingdom, started at ¬£15,495 for the manual 2.0 GSI, rising to ¬£18,345 for the 2.0 CRTD SE Automatic. With around ¬£2,400 worth of extra equipment, for only ¬£1,000 more than the cost of the 2.0 GSI, however, the Trajet SE came with its own DVD player, privacy glass, SmartNav satellite navigation, and reversing sensors as standard. It was available with gasoline or diesel engines, and manual or automatic transmissions, with prices starting at ¬£16,495. With the launch of the SE 2.7 V6, all previous models, of the Trajet, were upgraded. The gasoline 2.0 GSI benefited from the engine CVVT, which was previously seen in the Coupe, increasing power from 133 to 139 bhp (99 to 104 kW), while CO2 emissions fell from 223 g/km to 208 g/km. Fuel consumption was also improved ‚Äî the combined figure (average consumption on town and highway driving) rose from 30.4 mpg to 32.5 mpg, imperial gallons (9.3 to 8.7 L/100 km). All Trajets from this point forward featured a third three point seat belt in the rear, which meant all passengers had the protection of a full seat belt. Additionally, the car came with a full five year unlimited mileage warranty, which was transferable between owners. Production ended in the beginning of 2008.

Most of government, industry and commerce use metric units, but imperial units are officially used to specify journey distances, vehicle speeds and the sizes of returnable milk containers, beer and cider glasses (though fresh milk is often still sold in multiples of pints, with the metric equivalent also marked). Imperial units are also often used to describe body measurements and vehicle fuel economy. In schools metric units are taught and used as the norm. Imperial units that remain in common usage in the UK are also taught. Adopting the metric system was discussed in Parliament as early as 1818 and some industries and even some government agencies had metricated, or were in the process of metricating by the mid-1960s. A formal government policy to support metrication was agreed by 1965. This policy, initiated in response to requests from industry, was to support voluntary metrication, with costs picked up where they fell. In 1969 the government created the Metrication Board as a quango to promote and coordinate metrication. In 1978, after some carpet retailers reverted to pricing by the square yard rather than the square metre, government policy shifted, and they started issuing orders making metrication mandatory in certain sectors. In 1980 government policy shifted again to prefer voluntary metrication, and the Metrication Board was abolished. By the time the Metrication Board was wound up, all the economic sectors that fell within its remit except road signage and parts of the retail trade sector had metricated. The treaty of accession to the European Economic Community (EEC), which the United Kingdom joined in 1973, obliged the United Kingdom to incorporate into domestic law all EEC directives, including the use of a prescribed SI-based set of units for many purposes within five years. By 1980 most pre-packaged goods were sold using the prescribed units. Mandatory use of prescribed units for retail sales took effect in 1995 for packaged goods and in 2000 for goods sold loose by weight. The use of \\"supplementary indications\\" or alternative units (generally the traditional imperial units formerly used) was originally to have been permitted for only a limited period. That period being extended a number of times due to public resistance, until in 2009 the requirement to ultimately cease use of traditional units alongside metric units was finally removed. British scientists, philosophers and engineers have been at the forefront of the development of metrication ‚Äì in 1861 a committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS), including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and Joule among its members, defined various electrical units in terms of metric rather than imperial units, and in the 1870s Johnson, Matthey & Co manufactured the international prototype metre and kilogram. HistoryBefore 1799= When James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne in 1603, England and Scotland had different systems of measure. Superficially the English and the Scots units of measure were similar ‚Äì many had the same names ‚Äì but there were differences in their sizes: in particular the Scots pint and gallon were more than twice the size of their English counterparts. In 1707, under the Act of Union, the Parliaments of England and Scotland were merged and the English units of measurement became the standard for the whole new Kingdom of Great Britain. The practical effect of this was that both systems were used in Scotland, and the Scottish measures remained in common use until the Weights and Measures Act 1824 outlawed them.Scottish Weights and Measures at scan.org.uk. Retrieved 7 April 2012 Gunter's chain ‚Äì one of Britain's earliest decimal-based measuring devices, each link being 0.001 furlongs, greatly simplified the measurement of land area This period marked the Age of Enlightenment, when people started using the power of reason to reform society and advance knowledge. Britons played their role in the realm of measurement, laying down practical and philosophical foundations for a decimal system of measurement which were ultimately to provide the building blocks of the metric system. One of the earliest decimal measuring devices, developed in 1620 by the English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter, introduced two new units of measure ‚Äì the chain and the link ‚Äì and a new measuring device: Gunter's chain. Gunter's chain was one chain (one tenth of a furlong) in length and consisted of 100 links, making each link 0.001 furlongs. The decimal nature of these units and of the device made it easy to calculate the area of a rectangle of land in acres and decimal fractions of an acre.. Having difficulties in communicating with German scientists, the Scottish inventor James Watt, in 1783, called for the creation of a global decimal measurement system. A letter of invitation, in 1790, from the French National Assembly to the British Parliament to help create such a system using the length of a pendulum as the base unit of length received the support of the British Parliament, championed by John Riggs Miller, but when the French overthrew their monarchy and decided to use the meridional definition of the metre as their base unit, Britain withdrew support. The French continued alone and created the foundations of what is now called the Syst√®me International d'Unit√©s and is the measurement system for most of the world. =1799‚Äì1962= In 1799, the French created, and started to use, a new system with the metre and the kilogram as the units of length and mass. As use of this new system, originally called the \\"Decimal System\\", spread through Europe, there were some calls in the United Kingdom for decimalisation. The issue of decimalisation of measurement was intertwined in the United Kingdom with decimalisation of currency. The idea was first discussed by a Royal Commission that reported in 1818, and again in Parliament by Sir John Wrottesley in 1824. Another Royal Commission was set up 1838 by Chancellor of the Exchequer Thomas Spring Rice and it reported in 1841 that decimal coinage was required first. A third commission in 1853 advocated decimal coinage in the form ¬£1 : 10 florins : 100 cents: 1000 mils. The first florins (one tenth of a pound sterling) were struck in 1849 as silver coins weighing 11.3 grams (defined as troy ounce) and having a diameter of . Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, in 1851. Judges in the exhibition were hampered by the variety of units of measure in use. An early supporter of the Decimal Association was the mathematician Augustus de Morgan whose articles supporting the metric system had been published in the Penny Cyclopeadia (1833) and The Companion to the Almanac (1841). A few days later Wrottesley met with Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, but was unable to win him over to the idea. The inherent problems associated with handling multiple currencies and systems of units encountered in the Great Exhibition of 1851 triggered calls for a standardisation of units across Europe with the metric system being suggested as the natural choice. In 1854, de Morgan was influential in setting up the \\"Decimal Association\\" to lobby for decimalisation of both measurement and coinage. In 1862, the Select committee on Weights and Measures favoured the introduction of decimalisation to accompany the introduction of metric weights and measures. A further Royal Commission \\"on the question of the introduction of metric system of weights and measures\\" also reported in 1869. In 1863, a bill which would have mandated the use of the metric system throughout the British Empire, and which had passed its first and second readings in the House of Commons, was rejected at its Commons Committee stage as impractical, and so did not pass into law. The following year, after pressure from the astronomers George Airy and Sir John Herschel, the bill was watered down to merely legalise the use of the metric system in contracts. It was presented and passed as a Private Member's Bill. Ambiguous wording in the 1864 Act meant that traders who possessed metric weights and measures were still liable to arrest under the Weights and Measures Act 1835 5¬∞ & 6¬∞ William IV. Cap. 63. While the politicians were discussing whether or not to adopt the metric system, British scientists were in the forefront in developing the system. In 1845, a paper by James Prescott Joule proved the equivalence of mechanical and thermal energy, a concept that is vital to the metric system ‚Äì in SI, power is measured in watts and energy in joules regardless of whether it is mechanical, electrical or thermal. Joule's Heat Apparatus, 1845 In 1861, a committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and Joule among its members was tasked with investigating the \\"Standards of Electrical Resistance\\". In their first report (1862), they laid the ground rules for their work ‚Äì the metric system was to be used and measures of electrical energy must have the same units as measures of mechanical energy. In the second report (1863), they introduced the concept of a coherent system of units whereby units of length, mass and time were identified as \\"fundamental units\\" (now known as base units). All other units of measure could be derived (hence derived units) from these base units. In 1873, another committee of the BAAS that also counted Maxwell and Thomson among its members and was tasked with \\"the Selection and Nomenclature of Dynamical and Electrical Units\\". They recommended the CGS (centimetre-gram-second) system of units. The committee also recommended the names \\"dyne\\" and \\"erg\\" for the CGS units of force and energy. The CGS system became the basis for scientific work for the next seventy years. In 1875, a British delegation was one of twenty national delegations to a convention in Paris that resulted in seventeen of the nations signing the Metre Convention on 20 May 1875, and the establishment of three bodies, the CGPM, CIPM and BIPM, that were charged with overseeing weights and measures on behalf of the international community. The United Kingdom was one of the countries that declined to sign the convention. In 1882 the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co secured an agreement with the French government to supply 30 standard metres and 40 standard kilograms. Two years later the United Kingdom signed the treaty and the following year it was found that the standard yard which had been in use since 1855 had been shrinking at the rate of one part per million every twenty years. In 1889, one of the standard metres and one of the standard kilograms that had been cast by Johnson, Matthey & Co were selected at random as the reference standard and the other standards, having been cross-correlated with each other, were distributed to the signatory nations of the treaty. In 1896, Parliament passed the Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act, legalising metric units for all purposes but not making them compulsory. The situation was clarified in 1897 following another Select Committee which also recommended that metrication become compulsory by 1899. In 1902, an Empire conference decided that metrication should be compulsory across the British Empire. In 1904, scientist Lord Kelvin led a campaign for metrication and collected 8 million signatures of British subjects. On the opposition side, 1904 saw the establishment of the British Weights and Measures Association for \\"the purpose of defending and, where practicable, improving the present system of weights and measures\\". At this time 45% of British exports were to metricated countries. Parliament voted to set up a Select Committee on the matter. This Select Committee reported in 1907 and a bill was drafted proposing compulsory metrication by 1910, including decimalisation of coinage. The matter was dropped in the face of wars and depression, and would not be again raised until the White Paper of 1951, the result of the Hodgson Committee Report of 1949 which unanimously recommended compulsory metrication and currency decimalisation within ten years. The report said \\"The real problem facing Great Britain is not whether to adhere either to the Imperial or to the metric system, but whether to maintain two legal systems or to abolish the Imperial.\\" The report also recommended that any change should be implemented in concert with the Commonwealth (former Empire) and the US, that the United Kingdom adopt a decimal currency and that the United Kingdom and United States harmonise their respective definitions of the yard using the metre as a reference. The Hodgson Report was originally rejected by British industry, but in 1959 the United Kingdom and United States redefined their respective yards to be 0.9144 m exactly. 1962 onwards Metrication logo of the Board of Trade Soft metrication: British electric plug designed to BS 1363. The blade width, originally inch as per is now 6.35 mm as per The British Standards Institution (BSI) chose to stimulate metrication discussion in May 1962 by issuing a short statement on the subject. The introduction of the metric system was a topic at the Fifth Commonwealth Standards Conference that was held in Sydney in October 1962. Also in October 1963, the BSI, based on the results of inquiries by its committees, stated that their view was that changes in the field of measurement were inevitable. They also stated that they thought these changes should be channelled towards the metric system becoming the primary weights and measures system for the UK as soon as possible. In 1965, the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system, though some sectors emphasised the need for a voluntary system of adoption. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. There would be minimal legislation as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell. Work on adapting specifications started almost as soon as the government first gave its approval in 1965. The BSI took the lead in coordinating the efforts of industry, and where appropriate working with the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), CEE, CEN and CENELEC while the Royal Society liaised with professional societies, schools and the like. Initially the BSI targeted 1200 basic standards which were converted to metric units by 1970. Most of the remaining 4000 standards were converted in the ensuing five years. There were three principal ways in which metrication was implemented: *Hard metrication which resulted in new products based on round metric quantities ‚Äì for example A4 paper replaced both foolscap and quarto paper and in rugby union 5, 10 and 22 metre lines replaced the 5, 10 and 25 yard lines respectively. In many cases the new British Standards were based on existing foreign or international standards, for example ISO 216 (based on the German DIN standard DIN 476) which defined the \\"A series\\" of paper. *Soft metrication where existing standards were rewritten using metric units, but the underlying products remained unchanged: one typical example is that the standard rail gauge was changed from to 1435 mm, a reduction of 0.1 mm, but well within the allowable tolerance of 5 mm. This approach was used where any radical changes would have been impractical. *Revision of measurement techniques were introduced in cases where the concepts behind the existing standard or practice were found to be archaic. One such revision was to define the strength of alcoholic drink as a percentage alcohol by volume rather than, in the case of whisky, in \\"degrees proof\\" (described by Lord Brown as being \\"based on a test that involves the burning of a given quantity of gunpowder\\"). =The Metrication Board= Metric Britain logo, Metrication Board In July 1968, following the publication of a report from the Standing Joint Committee on Metrication, the government announced that an advisory metrication board would be set up as soon as possible, to oversee the metrication process, with a target completion date of the end of 1975. The report favoured the board being made up of part-time members drawn from commerce and industry, with government, education and consumer interests also being represented. In December 1968 the government announced the set up of the Metrication Board to coordinate the metrication programme, with Lord Ritchie-Calder being appointed as chairman. By this time much of the groundwork, especially rewriting of many British Standards using metric units, had been done and many of the industries that stood to benefit from metrication had already metricated, or had a metrication programme in progress. =Policy review= The general election of 18 June 1970 resulted in a change of government and four months later, on 27 October 1970, following an anti-metrication motion being tabled calling on the new government not to continue with the previous government's metrication commitments, the government announced that a White Paper would be produced to examine the cost, savings, advantages and disadvantages of a change to the metric system. During the debate when the announcement was made, Conservative MPs complained that metrication was being introduced by stealth. The White Paper was published in February 1972, and it set out the case for metrication and refuted the charge of metrication by stealth as metric units had been lawful for most purposes since 1897. It also reported that metrication would be necessary for the UK to join the European Common Market and that as British industry was exporting to all parts of the world they would benefit. It also reiterated the previous government's policy that metrication should be voluntary and hoped metrication would be mostly complete within ten years. The expectation was also expressed that with both the imperial and metric systems coexisting for many years, that consumers would gradually become familiar and comfortable with the metric system. =Progress= Shortly after the publication of the White Paper, the Minister of Transport announced postponement of the metrication of speed limits, which had been scheduled for 1973. The rest of the metrication programme continued, with the following completion dates: *1970 Electric Cable Makers Confederation, British Aerospace Companies Limited drawing and documentation, London Metal Exchange, flat glass *1971 Paper and board, National Coal Board designs, pharmaceuticals *1972 Paint industry, steel industry, building regulations *1974 Textile and wool transactions, leading clothing manufacturers adopt dual units *1975 Retail trade in fabrics and floor coverings, post office tariffs, medical practice *1976 Bulk sales of petroleum, agriculture and horticulture *1977 Livestock auctions *1978 Solid fuel retailing, cheese wholesaling, bread, London Commodity Market Yet the target of completion by 1975 \\"in concert with the Commonwealth\\" was not achieved; Australia, New Zealand and South Africa all completed their metrication processes by 1980. = Education = In England and Wales, unlike Scotland, education was controlled at county council level rather than at national level. In 1967 the Department for Education alerted all local education authorities to the need to adapt to the metric system. In 1968 all bodies that had an interest in the examination system were invited to contribute to the discussion of both metrication and decimalisation in education. In science subjects, this meant a conversion from the cgs system to SI, in geography from the imperial system to SI while in mathematics it meant discarding the teaching of mixed unit arithmetic, a topic that took up a significant part of the time allocated in primary schools to arithmetic/mathematics and 7% of total time allocated to all subjects. Old- fashioned schoolroom at The Ragged School Museum, with pre-decimal-currency conversions on the blackboard In Scotland, virtually all examinations set from 1973 onwards have used SI, especially those connected with science and engineering. In England, each examination board had its own timetable ‚Äì the Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations, for example, announced a change to SI in 1968, with examinations in science and mathematics using SI by 1972, Geography in 1973 and Home Economics and various craft subjects being converted by the end of 1976. Pupils were hampered by a revolution in teaching methods that was taking place at the same time and a lack of coordination at the national level. According to a report in 1982, children were taught the relationship between decimal counting, decimal money and metric measurements, with time being the only quantity whose units were manipulated in a mixed-unit manner. The year 1988 saw the introduction, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of the National Curriculum, in which SI is the principal system of measurement and calculation. Following devolution, there are now separate but similar curricula for state schools in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. They provide for pupils to be taught to measure, calculate and solve problems using the metric system, but also to be cognisant of the Imperial measurements still in common use and their approximate metric equivalents. Scotland has always had a separate education system Curriculum for Excellence and there the units of measurement taught in education are the SI or metric system. =Wholesale, retail and consumer industries= The retail industry proved difficult for the Metrication Board. The sector saw little benefit in metrication ‚Äì competition was fierce and margins low. The opinions of the trade organisations with which the Metrication Board could negotiate were fragmented. Many sectors of the industry did agree to a programme coordinated by the Metrication Board, with metrication of pre-packaged goods being introduced on a commodity by commodity basis. In 1977 when a carpet retailing chain reneged on an industry-wide agreement to use metric units (carpeting at ¬£8.36 per square yard being much more appealing to the customer than carpeting at ¬£10.00 per square metre), it became necessary for the first time to use legislation to enforce metrication rather than to rely on a voluntary adoption of the system. Much of the retail industry was metricated during 1977 and 1978 by means of statutory orders. By the beginning of 1980, 95% of the \\"basic shopping basket\\" of foods were sold in metric quantities, with only a few products not being sold in prescribed metric quantities. The final report of the Metrication Board catalogues dried vegetables, dried fruit, flour and flour products, oat products, cocoa and chocolate powder, margarine, instant coffee, pasta, biscuits, bread, sugar, corn flakes, salt, white fats, dripping and shredded suet as being sold by prescribed metric quantities while no agreement had been reached with the industry regarding jam, marmalade, honey, jelly preserves, syrup, cereal grain and starches. When the Metrication Board was abolished in 1980, agreement had been reached with the EEC regarding the use of certain imperial measures until the end of 1989, a date that was subsequently extended to 1999. By this date most pre-packaged goods were sold in metric quantities with loose goods and goods weighed in front of the customer continuing to be sold in imperial quantities. In 1999, when the British Government allowed the derogation for the use of imperial units to lapse, all goods (apart from beer, cider and milk in returnable containers) had to be priced in metric units. The changeover to selling of petrol by the litre rather than by the gallon took place after the Board was wound up. It was prompted by a technical shortcoming of petrol pump design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be switchable between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above ¬£1.999 per unit of fuel. Once the price of petrol rose above ¬£1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps. In the United Kingdom, draught beer and cider are the only goods that may not be sold in metric units. Since 2011, the legal measures for these are pint (189 ml), pint (284 ml), pint (379 ml), and subsequent multiples of the half-pint. Other alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises are sold by metric measure, as the , and gill measures for spirits (whisky, gin, rum and vodka) were replaced by 25 ml and 35 ml measures on 1 January 1995, and wine can only be sold in 125 ml, 175 ml or 250 ml glasses; prior to 1995, the size of wine glasses was unregulated. =Other sectors= Grid square TF. The map shows The Wash and adjoining areas. The grid square itself has sides of 100 km; the smaller squares shown on the map each have sides of 10 km. Before the Hodgson Committee, the metrication process was already in operation. One example was the Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency for Great Britain, which initiated the Retriangulation of Great Britain in 1936, using metric measures. See pages 270‚Äì272 A metric National Grid was used as the basis for maps published by the Ordnance Survey from World War II onwards; War Office maps had had a metric grid since 1920. The Ordnance Survey decided on full metrication in 1964. The one inch to the mile (1:63,360) range of maps started being replaced with the 1:50000 range in 1969. The metrication of Admiralty Charts began in 1967 as part of a modernisation programme. , road and street maps with primary scales in miles per inch are being marketed under the A-Z brand. Another example was the Met Office, which began publishing temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit in 1962, and stopped using Fahrenheit in their official reports in 1970. Many other sectors metricated their operations in the late 1960s or early 1970s. This was not visible to the general public, though the financial pages of newspapers displayed metric prices, e.g. in the principal London commodity markets (the London Metal Exchange, and the various agricultural markets, but not the oil industry). The actual units of measure are catalogued in the historic data reports and other daughter pages. =Costs= The basis of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme, with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs of and savings from metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined, and studies have tended to focus on specific programmes. As the programme was voluntary, industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach. In many cases this meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units as part of an ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry: all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations still measure in cubic feet. A 1970s study by the United Kingdom chemical industry estimated costs at ¬£6m over seven years, or 0.25% of expected capital investment over the change period. Other estimates ranged from 0.04% of a large company's turnover spread over seven years to 2% of a small company's turnover for a single year. Many companies reported recouping their costs within a year as a result of improved production. Some 90% of United Kingdom exports go to metric countries (as only the United States, Liberia, Myanmar have not adopted the International System of UnitsThe CIA world factbook), and there are costs to business of maintaining two production lines (one for exports to the US in US customary units, and the other for domestic sales and exports to the rest of the world in metric). These costs have been estimated at 3% of annual turnover by the Institute of Production Engineers, and at ¬£1.1 billion (1980) per annum by the CBI. Regardless of United Kingdom metrication, goods produced in the United Kingdom for export to the United States would have still been labelled in non-metric units to comply with the US Fair Packaging and Labelling Act. In 1978 the cost of converting road signs from miles to kilometres in the United Kingdom was estimated to be between ¬£7.5 million and ¬£8.5 million (1978 prices). A 2005 report pointed to the metrication of the United Kingdom's two million road signs as the major cost of completing the United Kingdom's metrication programme. The Department for Transport (DfT) costed the replacement of all of the United Kingdom's road signs in a short period of time at between ¬£565 million and ¬£644 million. In 2008‚Äì09, before the outcome of the consultations that led to the EU directive 2009/3/EC was known, the DfT had a contingency of ¬£746 million for the metrication of roads signs.  Regulatory aspects  Adoption of European legislation = A public safety notice with distance quoted in metres. Historically, weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom only applied to trade, but when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community, it had to align its legislation with EEC directives that were in place. These directives included EEC directive 71/354/EEC which related to weights and measures and which required the United Kingdom to formally define in law a number of units of measure, hitherto formally undefined in law, including those for electric current (ampere), electric potential difference (volt), temperature (degree Celsius and kelvin), pressure (pascal), energy (joule) and power (watt).NHS hospital trolley Due to public opposition to metrication (a 1979 survey indicated that, of people who knew about the programme, 46% opposed it and 31% supported it), the programme stalled. In the late 1970s, the UK government asked the EEC to postpone the deadlines for the introduction of metric units. The result was the repeal of directive 71/354/EEC and the introduction of directive 80/181/EEC. This new directive contained a derogation allowing the continued use in the UK, until the end of 1989 (subsequently extended to 1995), of many imperial units then in use for trade. The directive should have been transposed into United Kingdom law by 30 June 1981, but this was not done until the Weights and Measures Act 1985, which also removed from the statute book many imperial units that had fallen into disuse as a result of the completed elements of the metrication programme. At the end of 1988, the derogation was extended generally until the end of 1994, and until the end of 1999 for the sale of loose goods. This amendment was transposed into United Kingdom law by the Units of Measurement Regulations 1994. At the same time, regulations were passed prescribing metric quantities by which the remaining pre-packaged retail commodities not yet defined in metric terms could be sold. From the beginning of 1995, pre-packed coffee, coffee mixtures and coffee bags had to be sold in the prescribed quantities of , , , , , , , , , , or a multiple of or of ; and honey, jam and marmalade other than diabetic jam or marmalade, jelly preserves and molasses, syrup and treacle in quantities of , , , , , or a multiple of . The number of units of measure to which derogations applied was reduced with effect from 1 October 1995 and reduced further with effect from 1 January 2000. A direct result of the changes that were effective from 1 January 2000 was the requirement that most loose goods sold by weight, volume or length (for example, potatoes or tomatoes that were sold loose, or cheese or meat that was cut or weighed in front of the customer) must be priced and measured using metric units. The use of the acre as the primary unit for land registration was officially replaced by the hectare on 1 January 2010, under an EU ruling. The acre is still used as a supplementary unit alongside the hectare for land registration. Since 1 January 2010, the remaining non-metric units, allowed by United Kingdom law without supplementary indicators for economic, public health, public safety or administrative use, are limited to: * the mile, yard, foot and inch for road traffic signs, distance and speed measurement, * the imperial pint for the dispensing of draught beer and cider, and for the sale of milk in returnable containers, * the troy ounce for transaction in precious metals. Goods and services sold by a description, as opposed to a price per unit quantity, are not covered by weights and measures legislation; thus, a fence panel sold as \\"6 foot by 6 foot\\" is legal, as is a 6 x 4 inch photograph frame, but a pole sold as \\"50 pence per linear foot\\", with no accompanying metric price, would be illegal. =Supplementary indicators= In response to the specific requirements of the United Kingdom and of Ireland, both of which were in the process of converting to the metric system, Directive 80/181/EEC incorporated a provision that any unit of measure could be followed by a \\"supplementary indicator\\", provided that the supplementary indicator was not the dominant unit and that it was \\"... expressed in characters no larger than those of the corresponding indication ...\\". Initially this provision was to have expired in 1989, but it was extended first to 1999 and then to 2009. During the 2007 consultations on the revision of the directive, strong representations were made to retain this provision, as its removal would impede trade with the United States. When the directive was revised in 2009, the \\"sunset clause\\" was removed from the text. The EU directive gives no guidance as to what units may or may not be used as supplementary indicators, but British legislation has restricted the units that may be used in this way for purposes of trade to specified imperial units only. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom it is still common to see imperial packaging sizes marked with metric units. For example, most jars of jam, packs of sausages and tins of golden syrup are marked 454 g. There are no restrictions on the units that consumers can use when asking for goods, and the use of supplementary indicators and dual-measure weighing scales (provided these have been calibrated in metric) means that a consumer can see an imperial price, request an imperial quantity and be supplied with the imperial quantity, provided that the seller legally weighs out and sells the metric equivalent. =Scope of the EU Directive= In its initial form, the scope of directive 80/181/EEC was restricted to \\"economic, public health, public safety and administrative\\" purposes only. An outcome of the 2007 consultations was a proposal by the EU Commission to extend the scope of the directive to include \\"consumer protection\\" and \\"environmental issues\\". This was implemented by removing the phrase limiting the scope of the directive, thereby extending it to all matters that come under the ambit of the Internal Market Chapter of the EU Treaty. The directive specifically excluded units of measurement used in international treaties relating to rail traffic, aviation and shipping such as expressing aircraft altitude in feet. The United Kingdom's legislation of 2009 that implemented these changes made no reference to the extension of the directive's scope. =Weighing machines= A Class II laboratory scale (accuracy 1 part in 22,000) with a calibrator's and CE stickers fixed to its side. During the 1990s, a series of statutory instruments relating to weighing devices and to the sale of pre-packaged goods were issued to ensure that United Kingdom law on metrology was harmonised with that of its EEC partners. In line with EEC practice, the meaning of weights displayed on pre-packaged goods was changed in 1980 to show the average weight of each item in the batch rather than the guaranteed minimum weight of each individual item. The EU Measuring Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/22/EU) which intends to create a common market for measuring instruments across the countries of the EU came into force on 30 October 2006 with a ten-year transition period. The EU non-automatic weighing instrument directive (directive 2009/23/EC), which came into force in 2009 and was superseded by directive 2014/31/EU, codified existing regulations regarding the harmonisation of non-automatic weighing devices used for trade, medical purposes or in the preparation of evidence to be heard in court. The directive identified four classes of weighing device ranging from Class I (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 50,000) to class IIII (sic) (having a minimum accuracy of 1 part in 100). Devices that fall within the scope of the directive are required to be recalibrated at regular intervals and to have an output showing SI units, except for those used for weighing precious metals or stones. Secondary indications may be shown, provided that they cannot be mistaken for primary indications. The impact of this directive in the United Kingdom is that most traders cannot legally use weighing devices calibrated in units other than SI units. In 2000, after the deadline for the cessation of selling loose produce by imperial units had passed, some traders continued to sell produce from their market stalls using imperial-only scales. They were variously prosecuted for using unlawful scales, giving short measure and failing to display unit price per kilogram. Five traders, who became known as the Metric Martyrs, appealed unsuccessfully to the High Court, were refused appeal to the House of Lords, and appealed unsuccessfully to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). A LACORS report published in March 2010 highlighting widescale use of inappropriate scales in hospitals, sometimes of domestic quality, recommended that on safety grounds NHS hospitals should use Class III (or better) metric-only scales. A Department of Health alert was subsequently sent to all NHS trusts endorsing these recommendations. Assessment of the British metrication programme After the UK government's White Paper on metrication was published in February 1972, the journal New Scientist reported the lack of urgency in the minister's handling of the issue and described how the government refused to use its purchasing power to advance the metrication process. It quoted one (unnamed) metricationalist as saying \\"[The White Paper] is not firming things up at all. It will turn us into a dual country\\". Studies of the British metrication programme included two by US government agencies: NASA in October 1976 and the National Bureau of Standards in April 1979. Both reports noted that the British metrication programme lacked leadership from government. This manifested itself in many ways including: #The failure to appoint the Metrication Board at the start of the metrication programme meant that industry had to take the lead in a programme that affected everybody and did not have the machinery to implement metrication in, especially, the retail sector. #The failure of government to provide funding ‚Äì much of the initial work was funded by industry itself. #The failure to provide a \\"champion\\" for metrication ‚Äì such a role fell outside the remit of the Metrication Board. #The belief that the programme could be accomplished purely by voluntary means ‚Äì both reports highlighted the need for appropriate legislation to keep the programme on track. These sentiments were echoed in the final report of the Metrication Board. The involvement of the European Commission led metrication to be linked in public debate with Euroscepticism, and traditionally Eurosceptic parts of the British press often exaggerated or invented the extent of enforced metrication. Example stories include the Daily Star, which on 17 January 2001 claimed that beer would soon have to be sold by the litre in pubs, something not demanded in any EU directive. Reaction to the UK Metric Association report A Very British Mess (2004), the executive summary of which was published in Science in Parliament, was mixed: the Daily Telegraph suggested that the UKMA's assertion of hostility or indifference by the British public to the metric system was due to the lack of cultural empathy rather than it being \\"foreign or European\\", while the Economist said that retreat [to the imperial system] was impossible and the current impasse costly. An Ipsos MORI telephone survey conducted in September 2007 for The Sun newspaper, entitled \\"Northern Rock, Metric Measurements And The EU Constitutional Treaty\\" found significant opposition to metrication in response to the question, \\"How strongly would you support and oppose Britain switching to use entirely metric measurements, rather than continuing to use traditional units?\\": The greatest variation in opinion was between tabloid and broadsheet readers rather than by age, social class or voting intention. Current usage In its final report [1980], the Metrication Board wrote \\"Today metric units are used in many important areas of British life ‚Äì including education; agriculture; construction; industrial materials; much of manufacturing; the wholesaling of petrol, milk, cheese and textiles; fatstock markets and many port fish auctions, nearly all the principal prepacked foods; posts and telecommunications: most freight and customs tariffs; all new and revised Ordnance Survey maps; and athletics. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, Britain is far from being wholly metric.\\" The report major identified areas that had not yet been metricated as being the retail petrol trade [metricated in 1984], retail sale of loose goods [metricated in 2000] and roads signs [not metricated]. The report did not address issues related to the media such as news reports and advertising. =Retail industry= As from 1 January 2000, loose goods and goods sold from bulk had to be priced using metric units. The use of imperial units is optional. In compliance, these tomatoes are priced at ¬£2.65/kg and ¬£1.20/lb The regulations that came into force on 1 January 2000 regarding the sale of loose goods effectively made it mandatory to use metric units in the retail industry for most products, though supplementary indicators using certain imperial units were still permitted under UK law. Various price-marking orders prescribed the sizes in which products could be marketed. Some of these restrictions, such as wine being sold in 750 ml bottles, were derived from EU directives, while others, such as the production of bread in 400 g or 800 g loaves, were applicable to the UK only. The principle of the Internal Market, backed up by a judgment of the European Court of Justice, required that any product that was legally produced anywhere in the European Union could, in most cases, be sold anywhere in the EU. Thus a 500 g packet of rye bread, legally manufactured in Germany, could be sold in the United Kingdom even though it was not lawful under British law for a British baker to produce an identical 500 g packet of bread. A consultation by the EU aimed at bypassing this impasse was launched in 2004. The outcome was Directive 2007/45/EC, which deregulated prescribed packaging of most products, leaving only wines and liqueurs subject to prescribed EU-wide pre-packaging legislation. While this effectively undid much of the work done by the Metrication Board by deregulating prescribed sizing for over 40 products, the law relating to labelling of products has remained unchanged. =Government organisations= The civil service is bound by law to follow EU directives relating to public administration. Government disseminators of information include the Office for National Statistics and the Ordnance Survey office. Both of these, being government departments, use metric units in their work. =Road and rail transport= An example of a dual-unit road sign. Imperial units are mandatory on this class of sign; metric units are also mandatory on new signs after March 2015. Standards pertaining to transport infrastructure were metricated using soft conversions, as part of the general metrication of the engineering industry ‚Äì the standard railway track gauges fixed at 4 ft 8¬Ω in in 1845 was redefined as 1.435 m ‚Äì a decrease of 0.1 mm but well within the engineering tolerances. Motorway marker posts used by road maintenance teams and emergency services demarcate locations in multiples of 100 m. Standards relating to the design and building of new road and rail vehicles have been metric since the engineering changeover in the 1970s. Imperial units have been retained for both road and railway signage except on new railways such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, and the Tyne and Wear Metro and London Tramlink which along with all other modern British tram systems also operate in metric. The Cambrian Line has also changed to metric units with the change to ERMTS signalling. London Underground has converted to using metric units for distances but not for speeds. Apart from the sale of petrol, which was metricated in the 1980s, motorists have seen little metrication. Speedometers and mandatory information on car advertisements such as fuel consumption are given in both metric and imperial units. The 1994 TSRGD permitted the use of metric units alongside imperial units for width and height warning signs and dual metric/imperial signs became mandatory from March 2015. Distances and speed restrictions are shown only in imperial units. Public opinion2013 public survey of understanding and use= The UK Metric Association (UKMA) commissioned YouGov to carry out a survey to investigate \\"public understanding and use of metric and imperial units and of public support for completing the metric changeover\\". The UKMA executive summary of results of the September and November 2013 survey, published in 2014, presents the following points as the key results: * Half of respondents were opposed to completing metrication, with a quarter supportive and a fifth indifferent or non-committal. * Younger generations were more supportive than the older but 36% of the 18-24 age group were opposed (with 33% supportive and 22% indifferent or non-committal). * Where there are specific practical reasons for using metric units, the majority of the population prefer to use them. * Where parental, peer and media pressures are strongly in favour of imperial units, all age groups continue to use imperial - including for personal weighing (89% of the over 60s and 64% of the 18-24s). * There was a definite association between age and acceptance/use of metric units but there was still either a majority or a large minority of younger people who habitually use imperial rather than metric units for various everyday functions. * Despite opposition to metrication it was not likely to affect voting intentions in the next general election (when asked to choose four issues out of 17 as the most important when deciding how to vote only 1% selected converting from imperial to metric measurements). The sample size was 1,978 adults in September and 1,878 in November. The results were weighted and are said by YouGov to be representative of all GB adults (aged 18+). Advocacy groups A number of advocacy groups exist to promote either the metric or the imperial system. The groups include: *Active Resistance to Metrication, founded by Eurosceptic politician Tony Bennett, is best known for its direct action campaign against metric signs. * The British Weights and Measures Association campaigns for the retention of imperial measurements in the United Kingdom. * The UK Metric Association campaigns for the complete replacement of the imperial measurement system with the metric system in the United Kingdom.

It was written in 1986 and dedicated to the conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who gave the first performance in West Berlin with the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra on September 4, 1986. It takes the two words of its title from a poem by Francisco Tanzer. Stimmen... Verstummen... is primarily organized around two themes. The first is that of a major triad, occurring as D-major in the first, third, and fifth movements and as a G-major triad in the tenth and twelfth movements. The second theme, that of \\"effort and ruin\\", occurs in the second, fourth, and sixth movement. Movements I, III, V, and VII become progressively shorter according to the proportions of the Fibonacci sequence. The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This \\"conductor solo\\" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.

Nicknamed \\"the Hip Harpist\\", she is known for her flamboyant stage presence and her innovation with electric harps. Career Deborah Henson-Conant describes her music as \\"cross-genre: jazz- pop-comedy-folk-blues-flamenco-celtic\\". Deborah performs one-person shows in theaters, concert halls and festivals; and she does original music and theatre shows with symphony orchestras. Her performances mix music with theatrical and story elements. She orchestrates all her own music when she plays with symphony and often engages symphonic musicians in unexpected ways. She states that her career objectives include a desire to reevaluate misconceptions and underestimations of the harp instrument, of the stage medium, and of the self. The soundtrack of her 2006 DVD Invention & Alchemy, received a Grammy nomination, and the video version began broadcast on American public television in 2007. Her performance series Inviting Invention (2006) presents a series of \\"performance explorations\\" that includes both musical and non- musical guests collaborating onstage with Henson-Conant.

Rufford is also a civil parish, which includes the neighbouring village of Holmeswood, and in 2011 had a population of 2,049. History Rufford's name derives from the Old English r≈´h and ford, the rough ford. It was a crossing place over the River Douglas. Rufford was recorded as Ruchford in 1212, Rufford in 1285, Roughford in 1318, Rughford in 1332 and Roghforth in 1411. Part of the manor was granted by Richard Bussel, baron of Penwortham to Richard Fitton in the reign of Henry I. In 1278 his descendant and heiress Dame Maude Fitton married Sir William Hesketh. Sir William's grandson married the daughter of Edmund Fitton, who owned the other moiety of the manor which then descended with the Heskeths. In 1339 Sir William Hesketh was granted a charter for a weekly market and annual fair. He fought at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346, and was knight of the shire in 1360. In the late 15th century the Heskeths built Rufford Hall. It was altered in 1661 and redeveloped in the 1820s. The family built Rufford New Hall in 1760 and enlarged it around 1798‚Äì99 when the family left the old hall for the new. Governance Rufford was a chapelry in the parish of Croston from which it was separated by act of parliament and became a parish in 1793. It was part of the Leyland hundred and after 1837 became part of the Ormskirk Poor Law Union which built a workhouse and took responsibility for the poor in that area. Rufford is a ward in the borough of West Lancashire, and elects one member to the council. It also has a parish council that meets in the village hall. On Lancashire County Council, Rufford is combined with Burscough and Scarisbrick for the West Lancashire West ward. Geography Rufford is 5¬Ω miles north east of Ormskirk and covers 2,996 acres of mostly flat land which rises slightly towards Holmeswood in the north. The soil is loam over sand and much of the land is used for arable farming or pasture. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the railway between Liverpool and Preston pass through the township and the River Douglas separates it from Croston. Mere Sands Wood Nature Reserve, managed by the Wildlife Trust for Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside is a situated to the northwest. In medieval times this area was on the edge of Martin Mere and was drained by the Heskeths. Sand from this area was used for glass-making and extraction companies quarried the site between 1974 and 1982 after which it was restored as a nature reserve. The reserve is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, (SSSI), because of its geological features and a Lancashire Biological Heritage Site. PopulationEconomy The village is largely rural with little or no industry. The farmland is grade one agricultural land. In the early 20th century the village was described as \\"one of the prettiest in South Lancashire\\" and was a destination for day trips from neighbouring towns. Tourism began in Victorian times and today visitors are attracted by the National Trust property Rufford Old Hall, Mere Sands nature reserve and the marinas on the canal. There are tea shops and cafes in the village, a public house, the Hesketh Arms, and a hotel and restaurant, the Rufford Arms on the outskirts of the village. Transport Rufford lies on the A59 road linking it with Southport, Ormskirk, Preston and Liverpool. The nearest motorway is the M6 at Parbold. The Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway constructed its line through the village between 1847 and 1849, and Rufford railway station opened on 2 April 1849. The Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village to the east of Rufford Old Hall and there are two marinas, Fettlers Wharf and St Mary's which provide moorings. St Mary's Marina has a dry dock for repairs. Landmarks Rufford's two halls lie within a conservation area. Rufford Old Hall has belonged to the National Trust since 1936. It was home to the Hesketh family for over four hundred years until Rufford New Hall in Rufford Park was built. New Hall was bought by Lancashire County Council in 1920 and in 1926 it became a pulmonary hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis. Another landmark is the parish church built in 1869. The red brick Church of St Mary the Virgin, built in the Gothic style with a steeple, is a Grade II Listed building. The three-storey Hesketh Arms was probably built in the late 18th century of scored stucco on brick with low-pitched slate roof. The inn is painted white with stone quoins. The old inn is a Grade II listed building. The Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes on the east side. Religion A chapel was founded before 1346 when Sir Robert Hesketh was licensed to found a chantry. The chapel was rebuilt in 1735. It was a plain brick building with a bell cupola. A gallery and an organ were installed in 1829. The chapel was replaced in 1869 by the present church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, built of red brick and stone in the Gothic style. There is a Wesleyan Methodist church on Brick Kiln Lane, which was founded before 1893.

In 1989, the London School of Economics Students' Union elected Silcott as Honorary President, as a protest against miscarriages of justice. Silcott served 18 years imprisonment for the murder of boxer and nightclub bouncer Tony Smith, for which he was on bail when Blakelock was killed.

Silcott had also served a six-month prison sentence for assault in a nightclub prior to his conviction for the murder of Smith. In 2005, the police recruited Silcott to run a youth centre on the Broadwater Farm Estate, in a bid to reduce youth crime in the area. In March 2007, he was found guilty of theft from shops for a second time since his release from prison. After his initial arrest he was held in police cells for two days for failing to reveal his real address.

Aurum can, at times, be very predictable. Other times it can be very erratic. Observations have led to the theory that Aurum's activity is linked to the meadow behind the geyser. When the meadow is wet, activity is regular with 3 to 4 hours between eruptions. When the meadow dries in late summer and early fall, the interval becomes less predictable ranging from 4 to 7 hours. Aurum also participates in the weekly Geyser Hill wave. It decreases and increases its interval at regular times during a week. Eruptions last about 90 seconds and range in height from to . An eruption is usually preceded by bubbling in two small vents nearby. On rare occasions, an eruption will be followed by a second smaller eruption 5 to 10 minutes after the primary eruption.

According to Justin, Clearchus reached an agreement with Mithridates of Cius to betray the city to him on the condition that Clearchus would hold the city for Mithridates as governor. But, Clearchus then came to the conclusion that he could make himself master of the city without the aid of Mithridates. So he not only broke his agreement with the Mithridates, but also captured him and compelled him to pay a large sum for his release. Having deserted the side of the oligarchs, Clearchus put himself forward as the man of the people, and in around 365 BC obtained from the city's population the command of a body of mercenaries, and, having got rid of the oligarchs by murder and banishment, raised himself to the tyranny. He was said to have used his power as badly and with as much cruelty as he had gained it and, as a sign of his arrogance, assumed publicly the attributes of Zeus, and gave the name of Keraunos (i.e. \\"thunderer\\") to one of his sons. Thanks to his behaviour towards those he ruled over, Clearchus lived in constant fear of assassination, against which he guarded in the strictest way. But, in spite of his precautions, he was murdered by Chion and Leon in 353 BC, after a reign of twelve years. He was said to have been a pupil of both Plato and Isocrates, the latter of whom asserted that, while he was with him, he was one of the gentlest and most benevolent of men.In addition to Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, see the list of classical testimonia following.

Sumner-class destroyer, was named for Lieutenant Commander William Hank. Hank was launched 21 May 1944 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. William Edwin Hank, widow of Lieutenant Commander Hank; and commissioned on 28 August 1944, G. M. Chambers in command. Service historyWorld War II= After completing her Caribbean shakedown on 18 October, Hank joined , , and at New York and then sailed for the Pacific reaching Pearl Harbor on 6 December via the Panama Canal and San Francisco. Hank reported to Ulithi on 28 December and sortied 2 days later as part of the screen for Task Force 38, a fast carrier force under Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.. The primary mission of the carriers was to conduct air strikes against strategic Japanese positions along the China coast and on Formosa and Luzon to distract enemy attention and to divert Japanese ships from the landings at Lingayen Gulf which were to begin on 9 January 1945. The day after the invasion was launched, Task Force 38 moved into the South China Sea to conduct a series of devastating raids on targets along the China Coast and in Indochina. After launching one final raid against Okinawa, the carriers and escorts, Hank included, returned to Ulithi on 26 January 1945. Joining Task Force 58, a reorganized fast carrier strike force under the command of Admiral Marc Mitscher, Hank sortied on 10 February. Carrier planes launched massive raids against airfields, aircraft factories, and shipping in the Tokyo area 16 and 17 February in paralyzing diversionary strikes prior to the invasion of Iwo Jima, on 19 February. These raids, launched less than from Tokyo Bay itself, were the first carrier air strikes to hit Japan proper since the Doolittle raid of 1942. Among the ships which Hank helped screen in the 116 unit task force were battle veterans such as heavy cruiser , aircraft carriers , , , , , Yorktown, , and , and battleships , , , and . Deploying to the Iwo Jima area the afternoon of 18 February, Hank remained there to provide support for the invasion which began the following day, and she operated off the bitterly contested island until returning to Ulithi on 4 March. As the Pacific war moved into its climactic phases, Hank steamed from Ulithi on 14 March, with Task Force 58 for further strikes against the Japanese home islands. Closing to within of their targets, the carriers launched massive strikes against airfields on Kyushu and ships in the Inland Sea 18‚Äì19 March. Although under heavy air opposition from time to time, the carrier planes claimed a total of 528 Japanese aircraft destroyed. After participating in the bombardment of enemy shore positions‚Äîincluding radio facilities, a weather station, and an airfield on Minami Daito Shima on 27‚Äì28 March, Hank headed for Okinawa. Her task force furnished support for landings made on that heavily fortified island on 1 April, and Hank spent a busy week screening the carriers and stopping kamikazes with highly effective antiaircraft fire. The destroyer then reported to a lonely radar picket station, where on the afternoon of 11 April she narrowly averted disaster by her effective gunfire. As a kamikaze came in low off the port bow, heading directly for the bridge, Hanks accurate antiaircraft fire deflected it slightly, but the Zero came in close enough to kill three sailors before crashing into the sea and exploding close aboard. After repairs at Ulithi, Hank again joined Task Force 58 on 1 May to resume screening and radar picket duties off Okinawa. June was spent at San Pedro Bay, Philippines, undergoing replenishment and training, and on 1 July the carriers redesignated Task Force 38 and operating under Vice Admiral McCain in Admiral Halsey's 3rd Fleet sortied to launch further strikes against the home islands. Hank spent most of this period on hazardous and lonely radar picket duty, steaming from the main body of ships to provide early warning of enemy air attacks. On the night of 18 July, she joined Destroyer Squadron 62 and Cruiser Division 18 for an antishipping sweep across the entrance to Tokyo Bay. As she patrolled her radar picket station on 9 August, Hank and found themselves in the midst of five kamikazes. One of the aircraft came so close to Hank that it drenched both ship and personnel forward with gasoline before the veteran ships destroyed it and the other four attackers. Borie had been hit in the after bridge structure and suffered 48 dead and 66 wounded, while Hank had to report 1 man missing in action and 5 wounded. Hostilities ceased on 15 August 1945, and Hank steamed proudly into Tokyo Bay 10 September to participate in the occupation. She continued operations around Japan and Pearl Harbor through 30 December, when she sailed for Charleston, S.C., via Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the Panama Canal. =Korean War= The veteran ship operated primarily out of New Orleans for reserve training cruises and good will visits to Caribbean and Central American ports until sailing on 6 September 1949 for the Mediterranean. During her 5 months with the 6th Fleet, Hank participated in amphibious operations and visited Gibraltar, Malta, France, Sicily, Italy, and Algeria. Returning to Norfolk on 26 January 1950, Hank engaged in training operations and a cruise to the Caribbean until sailing for the Far East and the Korean War on 6 September. She arrived Yokosuka, Japan, 1 month later and joined the United Nations Blockade and Escort Force off the Korean coast. Her movements centered mainly around Wonsan Harbor, then under siege, with frequent interruptions for blockade patrol and bombardment missions. Hank supported the evacuation of Wonsan in early December and then moved up to Hungnam to help provide the curtain of fire which covered the evacuation of Allied troops. In January and February 1951, Hank supported the 8th Army as it moved to recapture and consolidate Seoul and Inchon. Screening, blockade patrol, and shore bombardment constituted the destroyer's duties along the Korean coast until she sailed for the United States, reaching Norfolk on 9 June via SanDiego, the Panama Canal, and Guantanamo. =Post-war= After a yard overhaul at Norfolk, Hank resumed the peacetime training operations, Caribbean exercises, and annual deployments to the Mediterranean that kept the fleet ready to serve America well at any moment on the seas. In the fall of 1956, in the Suez Crisis, as warfare flared over the nationalization of the Suez Canal, Hank was there. In 1960, the destroyer with the Navy began to reach into space. She participated in training for Project Mercury, America's first man-in-space effort, off the Virginia capes, and she was designated one of the recovery ships when Astronaut Lieutenant Commander Scott Carpenter made his orbital flight 24 May 1962. Hank operated with on blockade and surveillance duty during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, remaining in the tension-filled Caribbean for nearly a month. She was designated a Naval Reserve Training Ship in October 1963 and proceeded to her new home port, Philadelphia. After undergoing repairs at Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Chester Pennsylvania, in 1964 Hank began reserve training cruises along the East Coast from Fort. Lauderdale, Florida, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, continuing into 1972. =Argentine naval service= Hank was decommissioned and sold to Argentina on 1 July 1972, and renamed ARA Segu√≠ (D-25). She participated in the Falklands War, taking part in the initial invasion of the Falklands in April 1982. Later, her Exocet missiles were removed, and remounted on an improvised coastal launch platform, from which they were used to hit HMS Glamorgan off Stanley at 06:37 on Saturday 12 June 1982. Segui was scrapped in 1983. Awards Hank received four battle stars for World War II, and four for Korean service. Reunions Men who served on the USS Hank hold a reunion in cities across the United States each year. Often spouses and families join them. Cities where reunions have been held are Buffalo, Charleston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and will be in St. Louis in Sept 2013.

Before his annihilation, Kendall's work in the Defense Department had grown unsatisfying for him, and so he instead devoted his time and efforts to the expansion of the ever growing cyberspace. In his latest project, he had created a way of designing a person's ego into the net, with such a cybernetic ego incorporating personality and intelligence in addition to tactile senses, using his own as a prototype. His attempt at doing so was a success, though Kendall never got a chance to reveal his findings to the world, as he was killed shortly after, awaking to see his family die at the hands of his murderers. Soon afterwards, Kendall's mind came to life again in the form of a cyberspace program. Throughout the game, the player controls Alex Kendall's cyberspace program of himself, seeking revenge of his family, and his own mortal self. The phrase \\"Revenge is best served on the Net\\" is shown in the opening titles before game play commences. Soundtrack The soundtrack for ShadowWraith is widely considered among the greatest video game soundtracks of all time and was composed by Steven Allen, Andrew Schlesinger, Volker Tripp, and Thomas Chenhall, with the songs being stored in MOD format. It consisted of the following song titles in alleged order of game play: #Extend #Into the Shadow #Haunt #Night #Cyberride #Fall #Wraith #Marshins #Dance of Zax #Overlord #World #Ryu #Stardust (Memories) #Oblivion #Silntrac (Silent Racer) #Elysium #Molecule (Molecule's Revenge) #DENSETSU #Pulse #Off Line Pulse #Dance Factory #Internal Impactor #Evergladez #Space #Xenon Reception Inside Mac Games complimented the game on its detailed physics model and music, among other things, and commented that ShadowWraith was better than the other games in its genre, though there were slight difficulties with switching weapons during gameplay and slower performance on 68030-based Macs.

It is located on the / in the Marolles/Marollen district of Brussels. Built between 1866 and 1883 by the celebrated architect Joseph Poelaert in the eclectic style, the building is reputed to be the largest constructed in the 19th century and is a notable landmark of Brussels. The total cost of the construction, land and furnishings was somewhere in the region of 45 million Belgian francs. This site is served by Louise/Louiza metro station (on lines 2 and 6 of the Brussels metro), and tram lines 92 and 94. From the lower part of town, it is also possible to take a lift called Ascenseur (Lift) des Marolles to access it. HistoryInception and construction= The current Palace of Justice is located on the Galgenberg hill, between Brussels' upper and lower town, where in the Middle Ages convicted criminals were hanged. A first courthouse had been erected on the site of a former Jesuit church, on Palace Square (today Justice Square), between / (today /) and /. Built between 1818 and 1823 by the architect Fran√ßois Verly, this neoclassical structure had quickly deteriorated, and the question of building a new and larger courthouse arose as early as 1837. It was initially planned to rebuild it in the same place, but this project, the cost of which was estimated at 3 million Belgian francs, quickly aborted. The idea of building it in the Leopold Quarter was no more successful. In 1846‚Äì47, another reconstruction project was also buried. Joseph Poelart, the architect of the Palace of Justice In 1860, during the reign of King Leopold I, a Royal decree announced the construction of the new Palace of Justice, and an international architectural contest was organised for its design. After several failed proposals, the then-Minister of Justice Victor Tesch appointed Joseph Poelaert to draw plans of the building in 1861. The first stone was laid on 31 October 1866, and the building was inaugurated on 15 October 1883, four years after Poelaert's death. As for the old courthouse, it was demolished in 1892. alt= For the Palace of Justice's construction, a section of the Marolles/Marollen neighbourhood was demolished, while most of the park belonging to the House of Merode was also expropriated. The 75 landlords belonging to the nobility and the high bourgeoisie,AVB, Liste des expropriations, publi√©e dans Poelaert et son temps, p.271: Plan du g√©om√®tre Van Keerbergen indiquant les propri√©t√©s n√©cessaires √† l'√©rection du Palais de Justice de Poelaert, 9 f√©vrier 1863 (A.V.B., T.P., 26.242). many of whom lived in their homes, received large indemnities, while the other more modest inhabitants, about a hundred, were also forced to move by the Belgian government, though they were compensated with houses in the Tillens-Roosendael garden city () in the Quartier du Chat in the Uccle municipality.Louis Qui√©vreux, Bruxelles, notre capitale: histoire, folklore, arch√©ologie, 1951, p. 257: \\"Ceux qui lui donn√®rent ce sobriquet, ce furent les expuls√©s de la ¬´partie¬ª des Marolles d√©molie afin que puisse √™tre √©rig√© le colosse de la place Louise. La rue des Sabots, celle de l‚ÄôArtifice et d‚Äôautres encore √©tant condamn√©es, on transplanta leurs habitants dans un quartier riant et campagnard; celui du Chat, √† Uccle, √† la limite de Forest. Poelaert himself resided in the Marolles, only a few hundred metres from the building, on /, in a house adjoining his vast offices and workshops and communicating with them.Poelaert et son temps, Bruxelles, (catalogue exposition), 1980, p. 166: \\"Il habitait une maison rue des Minimes, voisine de ses bureaux et qui communiquait avec ceux-ci\\"Le Patrimoine monumental de la Belgique, Bruxelles, 1C, Pentagone, N-Z, Brussels, edition Pierre Mardaga, 1994, p. 466: Boulevard de Waterloo. n¬∞ 12-13 \\"Deux maisons bourgeoises jumel√©es de quatre niveaux.\\"....\\"Le n¬∞ 13 √©tait l'habitation personnelle de l'architecte Joseph Poelaert, au moins durant la construction du Palais de Justice et jusqu'√† son d√©c√®s en 1879. L'actuelle fa√ßade d'allure Second Empire, datant des ann√©es 1860, lui est peut-√™tre m√™me attribuable\\". It is thus unlikely he saw himself as ruining the neighbourhood. Nonetheless, many angry citizens personally blamed Poelaert for the forced relocations, and the expression schieven architect (meaning \\"shameful architect\\") became one of the most serious insults in the dialect of the Marolles. Although the construction took place during the reign of King Leopold II, he showed little interest in the building, and it is not considered part of his extensive architectural programme in Brussels or his legacy as the \\"Builder-King\\". =Damage and renovation= At the end of the Second World War, on the eve of the liberation of Brussels, the retreating German forces started a fire in the Palace of Justice in order to destroy it, as well as the legal records it contained. As a result, the cupola collapsed and part of the building was heavily damaged. In 1947, the restoration work was entrusted to the architect-engineer Albert Storrer. By 1948, most of the building was repaired, and the cupola was rebuilt higher than the original, whose somewhat flat shape had been criticised. Renovations on the building have been in progress since 2003. These renovations pertain to the repair and strengthening of the roof structure and the walls, as well as putting a new layer on the gilded cupola. Progress is slow, and in 2013, it was reported that the decade-old scaffolding was so rusted and unsafe that the scaffolding itself was in need of renovation. Dimensions Brussels' Palace of Justice was, at the time of its construction, the largest building in the world, and remains today one of the largest courthouses. The edifice is currently , and has a total built ground surface of , bigger than St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The high dome weighs 24,000 tonnes. The building has 8 courtyards with a surface of , 27 large court rooms and 245 smaller court rooms and other rooms. Situated on a hill, there is a level difference of 20 meters between the upper and lower town, which results in multiple entrances to the building at different levels. The building includes huge interior statues of Demosthenes and Lycurgus by the sculptor Pierre Armand Cattier, and figures of the Roman jurists Cicero and Ulpian by Antoine-F√©lix Bour√©. The central portico, high, is surmounted by a bust of the ancient Greek Titaness Themis, personification of divine law and order, by Joseph Ducaju. Moreover, the impressive main hall or salle des pas perdus (literally meaning \\"room of the lost steps\\") is around including the first floor gallery, and is long and wide. A compass rose with sixteen rays indicates the centre of the room.

Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production in Nazi Germany, stated in his book Inside the Third Reich that he had been dispatched to Brussels in 1940 to study the building. Although lacking the dome and being much smaller, the Justice Palace in Lima, Peru; which houses the Supreme Court of Peru, is based upon Brussels' Palace of Justice.

Food miles are one factor used when testing the environmental impact of food, such as the carbon footprint of the food. The concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. It was conceived by Professor Tim Langhttp://www.city.ac.uk/communityandhealth/phpcfp/foodpolicy/index.html. He explains its history in this article Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)‚Äô, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97 at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) AllianceThe SAFE Alliance merged with the National Food Alliance in 1999 to become Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming http://www.sustainweb.org/. Professor Tim Lang chaired Sustain from 1999 to 2005. and first appeared in print in a report ‚ÄúThe Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport‚Äù, researched and written by Angela Paxton.Paxton, A (1994). The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport. SAFE Alliance, London, UK. http://www.sustainweb.org/publications/?id=191Iles, A. (2005). Learning in sustainable agriculture: Food miles and missing objects. Environmental Values, 14, 163-83 Some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the globalization of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket. These make a small part of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO2 are in production phases. Several studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport. These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'. In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions.(Garnett 2011, Food Policy) Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information. The concept of \\"food miles\\" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.John Hendrickson, \\"Energy use in the U.S. Food System: A summary of existing research and analysis.\\" Sustainable Farming (Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec), vol. 7, no. 4. Fall 1997. Overview The concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including local food. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, City University, London) who says: \\"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations.\\"Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)‚Äô, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97 The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961.Erik Millstone and Tim Lang, The Atlas of Food, Earthscan, London, 1963, p. 60. Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a DEFRA report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment, entitled The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development, included findings that \\"the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over ¬£9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion.\\"Smith, A. et al. (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development: Final report. DEFRA, London. See https://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/foodmiles/default.asp The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation, unless it is produced by local farms. The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.\\"Food, the carbon story\\", The Carbon Trust, 15 March 2012. Retrieved on 20 January 2015. Food miles in business A recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at Cornell University and supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets. It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets. Calculating food miles With processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number ‚Äì although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable ‚Äì or not ‚Äì a food product is. Wal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food travelled before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.Jane Black, \\"What‚Äôs in a Number: How the Press Got the Idea That Food Travels 1,500 Miles from Farm to Plate,\\" Slate, September 17, 2008, www.slate.com/ id/ 2200202. More recently, iOS and Android apps are appearing which allow consumers to get various information (nutritional information, ...) and track the origin of products they buy and sometimes also get additional information such as the distance the product has travelled from its production location to the consumer (i.e. OpenLabel, Glow, Open Food Facts, ...).Mobile barcode scanning apps empower consumers to shop with confidence These apps may rely on barcode scanning.Interview: OriginTrail, an app that tells you where your food is from Also, smartphones can simply scan the QR code, after which a link in the browser opens up showing the production location of the product (i.e. Farm to Fork project, ...).How consumers can track products at the touch of a smartphone button Criticism Fair trade = According to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple \\"food miles\\" measurements.Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map. IIED/Oxfam.Chi, 2009, p. 9. There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development. Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.MacGregor, J.; Vorley, B (2006) Fair Miles? Weighing environmental and social impacts of fresh produce exports from Sub-Saharan Africa to the UK. Fresh Insights no.9. International Institute for Environment and Development/ Natural Resources Institute, London, UK, 18 pp. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutPutId=173492 However, exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people. Unless the product has a Fairtrade certification label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers.C. Dolan, J. Humphrey, and C. Harris-Pascal, \\"Value Chains and Upgrading: The Impact of U.K. Retailers on the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Industry in Africa,\\" Institute of Development Studies Working Paper 96, University of Sussex, 1988. Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous. Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption, so local people can go hungry.Action Aid is one of many organisations drawing attention to this problem and campaigning to improve this situation - http://www.actionaid.org.uk = Energy used in production as well as transport = Researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production. A recent Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) case study indicated that tomatoes grown in Spain and transported to the United Kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy than heated greenhouses in the United Kingdom. According to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040, entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by economies of scale. Research from the Justus Liebig University Giessen show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of energy use per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production.Schlich E, Fleissner U: The Ecology of Scale. Assessment of Regional Energy Turnover and Comparison with Global Food. Int J LCA 10 (3) 219-223:2005.Schlich E: Energy Economics and the Ecology of Scale in the Food Business. In: Caldwell PG and Taylor EV (editors): New Research on Energy Economics. Nova Science Publishers Hauppauge NY:2008. A 2006 research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at Lincoln University, New Zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in Europe and New Zealand, taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers.Saunders, C; Barber, A; Taylor, G, Food Miles ‚Äì Comparative Energy/Emissions Performance of New Zealand‚Äôs Agriculture Industry (2006). Research Report No. 285. Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit, Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand. The report states, \\"New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK. For example New Zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant emissions) and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates. In the case of dairy and sheep meat production NZ is by far more energy efficient, even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat. In the case of apples, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK.\\" Other researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments ‚Äúin favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.‚Äù'Food miles' minor element of carbon footprint, http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=40471. See also a range of publications by Professor Edwards-Jones and a team of researchers at Bangor University, http://www.bangor.ac.uk/senrgy/staff/edwards.php.en Studies by Dr. Christopher Weber et al. of the total carbon footprint of food production in the U.S. have shown transportation to be of minor importance, compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production, and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment. = Livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases = Farm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.To see details of the United Nations research into meat and the environment, visit: http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html.

Exploring the livestock sector‚Äôs contribution to the UK‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions and assessing what less greenhouse gas intensive systems of production and consumption might look like Working paper produced a part of the work of the Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey https://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/TGlivestock_env_sci_pol_paper.pdf That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals. Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. Deforestation eliminates carbon sinks, accelerating the process of climate change. Cultivation, including the use of synthetic fertilisers, releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels, as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil. Meanwhile, it's increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK's consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption. According to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon University, of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet, even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet.Food miles are less important to environment than food choices, study concludes, Jane Liaw, special to Mongabay, June 2, 2008 They also concluded that \\"Shifting less than one day per week‚Äôs worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.\\" In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles. = \\"Local\\" food miles = A commonly ignored element is the last mile. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5 kg of meat over by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in bulk transport, or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or to buy that meat. Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices.Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2009. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. Food Policy, 34 (2), pp. 150-155. Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated. For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the last mile by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport. Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2011. Food miles: time for a re-think? British Food Journal, 113 (7), pp. 919-934. = Lifecycle analysis, rather than food miles = Lifecycle analysis, a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in resource depletion, air pollution and water pollution and waste generation/municipal solid waste.Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map. IIED/Oxfam. http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=15516IIED ‚Äì p16 A number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture.Examples include http://www.carbontrustcertification.com/ and www.cffcarboncalculator.org.uk Some are more robust than others but, at the moment, there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough, independent and reliable, and which ones are just marketing hype. Even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption. However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development, namely environmental, social and economic.World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, (1987).

Latterly it was also known as the Rheindahlen Military Complex, part of Rheindahlen Garrison. It was named after the local village of Rheindahlen, part of the city borough of M√∂nchengladbach. History In 1952, work began on the British Forces Maintenance Area West of the Rhine. Part of the project included the construction of a joint British Army and Royal Air Force headquarters for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in Rheindahlen. Colonel Henry Grattan was Chief Engineer of the construction project. HQ BAOR moved from Bad Oeynhausen to Rheindahlen in October 1954, centralising headquarters functions previously located across several towns in Northern Germany. It was originally the HQ of the Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2ATAF), British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG). Some 12,000 military personnel moved to the \\"town within a town\\" in a few weeks. By the early 1970s the facilities in the complex included a NAAFI superstore and a smaller NAAFI store (Buschof NAAFI), German shops, a petrol station (normally BP), a travel agent (Milatravel), two German banks (Commerzbank and Sparkasse), two post offices, dress shop (a Malcolm Club shop), YWCA Bookshop, libraries and cafes. There were separate full British Army (RAMC) and RAF Medical & Dental Centres, five British primary schools (St Georges, St Andrews, St Patricks, St Davids & St Christophers) and a Belgian school. There was one secondary school (initially Queens upper & lower until the senior school moved to Hostert Waldniel, later returning to JHQ and recombining as Windsor School. JHQ was first bombed by the Provisional IRA in 1973. The car bomb was planted in the Globe cinema car park and timed to go off as the film ended. In the event the film ended early and the car park was largely empty when the bomb exploded. No one was injured, but a couple of cars were damaged.

Thirty-one people were injured on 23 March 1987 after a car bomb exploded near the visitors officers' mess at the top of Queens Avenue. The Provisional IRA later stated it had carried out the bombing. During the 1990s and 2000s, JHQ housed the Headquarters United Kingdom Support Command (Germany), later Headquarters British Forces Germany, which was the administrative HQ of the British Army in Europe. It was also home to the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), which relocated to Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire in 2010. There was an Army Garrison HQ on Collingwood Road to administer the Army element and an RAF HQ (RAF Rheindahlen) on Queens Avenue to administer the RAF element. HQ British Forces Germany moved to Bielefeld in July 2013. The Rheindahlen military complex was handed back to German federal authorities on 13 December 2013. In July 2015 some Arab investors submitted proposals to convert the site to a leisure park. In September 2015 the main gas, electricity and water services were reconnected from the main Hardt-Rheindahlen road along Queens Avenue to the West boiler house to facilitate temporary use of the site as a refugee reception centre. In November 2015 the site was still a ghost town with civilian security guards and in April 2016 it was revealed that the refugees would be accommodated in the billets area around the parade ground off Beresford Road.

Founded in 1994 by children's rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi, it provides a certification program that allows companies that pass inspection to attach a logo certifying that their product is made without child labour. It is an example of a product-oriented multistakeholder governance group. Nina Smith, Executive Director of GoodWeave International explains: \\"I got involved in the movement to end child slavery because of a boy named Iqbal Masih. Iqbal was a carpet slave at the age of four and escaped servitude at 10. (...) Upon his return to Pakistan, Iqbal‚Äôs life was tragically cut short: he was murdered for his activism. His death helped to inspire the birth of GoodWeave (then RugMark). I read Iqbal‚Äôs story in a Vanity Fair feature after his death and realized the work that needed to be done in his memory\\". Media outlets worldwide have given detailed coverage to Rugmark (now known as GoodWeave). For example, The PBS NewsHour reported, \\"GoodWeave offers a labeling system that guarantees that no child labor was used in making the rugs.\\" According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the organization \\"has helped drastically reform the hand-knotted carpet industry in India, Nepal and Pakistan\\" The Guardian said, \\"GoodWeave's model centres on extensive monitoring and auditing at every stage of the supply chain,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded, \\"Rugmark is not just a symbol of quality. Its appearance on imported hand-knotted rugs is intended as a signal to consumers that child labor was not used in the production process.\\" Channel 4 News in Belfast observed, \\"Rugmark is the best scheme for ensuring that carpets are slave free\\" Responding to concern about violation of children‚Äôs rights during the 1980s, human rights organizations in Europe and India, along with UNICEF- India and the Indo-German Export Promotion Council, a German government agency, developed the program to provide assurance to consumers that the oriental carpets they were purchasing were made by adults rather than exploited children, and to provide for the long term educational and rehabilitation of children found working illegally on looms. The program was formally launched in India in the fall of 1994 and expanded into Nepal in 1996. Thereafter, negotiations with programs in Germany, Nepal, India, and the U.S. resulted in the formal creation of Rugmark International. An international constitution was adopted in May 1998. Rugmark International re- branded the certification program and introduced the GoodWeave label in 2009. The organization was also re-branded to GoodWeave International. Today the international network comprises producing country offices in India, Nepal and Afghanistan; and consumer country programs in the US, UK, and Germany. GoodWeave International is responsible for licensing throughout Europe and North America.

This model, with full-time gold farmers working long hours in cybercafes, was outsourced to China and initially served demand from Korean players. Gold farming in China was experiencing swift growth c. 2004. Cheap labor from inland provinces had washed into more cosmopolitan cities, and these real-life farmers were promptly pressed into service farming gold. In 2011, The Guardian reported that prisoners in some Chinese re-education camps were forced to engage in gold farming for the benefit of prison authorities. Academic studies of gold farming have revealed that the social networks of gold farmers are similar to those of drug dealers. Similar to gold farming, people may be hired to level up in-game avatars by harvesting experience points.

These ill effects can occur whether or not such practices are sanctioned by the game operator. Citing such concerns, Activision Blizzard shut down their real-money transaction system for Diablo III in 2014. During the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, Venezuelans became gold-farmers and could be seen playing online video games such as RuneScape to sell in-game currency or characters for real currency. In many cases, these gamers made more money than salaried workers in Venezuela even though they were earning just a few dollars per day. So many Venezuelans began this practice that it increased inflation with multiple game currencies.

It is the administrative seat of G≈Çubczyce County and Gmina G≈Çubczyce. Geography G≈Çubczyce is situated on the G≈Çubczyce Plateau (; a part of the Silesian Lowlands) on the Psina (Cina) river, a left tributary of the Oder. The town centre is located approximately south of Opole and just northwest of Ostrava. HistoryMiddle Ages= The settlement named Glubcici was first mentioned in an 1107 deed. At the time, it was a small village, dominated by a large wooden castle. It stood on the right bank of the Psina River, which according to an 1137 peace treaty between the dukes Sobƒõslav I of Bohemia and Boles≈Çaw III of Poland formed the border between the Moravian lands (then ruled by the Bohemian dukes) and the Polish province of Silesia. The exact date of the city foundation is unknown, but it is traceable back to 1224, when the town called Lubschicz held toll rights obtained from the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar I. Church of the Nativity of Virgin Mary However, in 1241 the town was devastated during the Mongol invasion. During the city's rebuilding, the left bank of the Psina was also settled, and in 1270 city rights were confirmed by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. During this time, a wall was built around the city, complete with watchtowers and a moat. A large parish church was also constructed in the town, which had been assigned by King Ottokar II to the Order of Saint John in 1259. After his defeat in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, the town privileges were acknowledged by King Rudolf I of Germany. Ottokar's widow Kunigunda of Halych had a hospital erected, run by the Knights Hospitaller who established a commandry here. In 1298, the town received expanded rights from King Wenceslaus II. The privileges granted to the citizens were to serve as an example for other towns in the years that followed. From about 1269, Hlubƒçice was part of the Moravian Duchy of Troppau (Opava), ruled by a cadet branch of the Bohemian P≈ôemyslid dynasty since Nicholas I, a natural son of King Ottokar II, had received the lands from the hands of his father. Upon the death of Nicholas' son Duke Nicholas II and the division of Troppau between his heirs, in 1377, the town became the residence of Nicholas III who ruled as a Duke of G≈Çubczyce. The town remained the seat of the Troppau branch of the P≈ôemyslids until the last Duke John II entered a Franciscan cloister in 1482. Upon his death three years later, his duchy was seized as a reverted fief by King Matthias Corvinus and transferred to the control of the Duchy of Krnov (J√§gerndorf, Karni√≥w) and the city finally lost its status as a residence. =Modern Era= While the Krnov principality was acquired by the Hohenzollern margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1523, the Protestant Reformation reached the town. George had married Beatrice de Frangepan, the widow of Matthias Corvinus' son John; he and his son George Frederick tried to exert Hohenzollern influence in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown which from 1526 onwards were ruled by the Catholic House of Habsburg. In 1558, a Lutheran church and school were built in G≈Çubczyce. In response to this, Franciscans and Jews were expelled from the city. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was completely destroyed, most devastatingly by Swedish forces in 1645. After the Silesian Wars, the city came under the rule of Prussia in 1743. Leobsch√ºtz was incorporated into the Province of Silesia by 1815 and became the administrative seat of a Landkreis (district). In 1781, the town's population stood at only, 2,637. In order to accommodate the city's expansion, parts of the city's wall were torn down. The population stood at 4,565 in 1825, and 9,546 in 1870. After World War I and the creation of the Republic of Poland, the Silesian plebiscite was held in Upper Silesia. The percentage of 99.5% of Leobsch√ºtz citizens voted for Germany. The Silesian Uprisings did not directly affect the city, which had almost exclusively German-speaking inhabitants. Former Leobsch√ºtz Synagoge, destroyed in 1938, with still existing parish church in the background After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the town hosted schools and training grounds for both the SS and the SA paramilitary forces, becoming the honorary centre of the Nazi Party in the Prussian Province of Upper Silesia. The town's synagogue was burned down in 1938, the same year as Kristallnacht. After the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, on 18 March 1945, Red Army troops began a siege of the city, which was resisted by the 18th SS Panzergrenadier Division (Tank grenadiers) and the 371st Wehrmacht division. The siege ended on March 24, and the Soviet forces occupied the town. Approximately 40 percent of the town was destroyed in the siege or by Red Army troopers plundering in the first weeks of the occupation. After the Soviet occupation, the name of the town was changed to G≈Çubczyce, its current name. The town was transferred, like most of Silesia, to the re- established Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement. The remaining German population was expelled and replaced by Polish refugees transferred from the Kresy in the former Polish eastern territories. Claims to the G≈Çubczyce territory were raised by the Czechoslovak Republic, which even sent troops to the area in June 1945. The border dispute around G≈Çubczyce was eventually settled in 1958 with the Czechoslovak-Polish border agreement.Bahlcke, Joachim: Schlesien und die Schlesier, 2006. , p. 187. The town became the seat of a Polish county, or powiat, in 1946. G≈Çubczyce lost that distinction in 1975, but regained it in 1999. Economy G≈Çubczyce town budget income's sources as of 2015 The town of G≈Çubczyce's economy is based around the agricultural sector and food production. Formerly, during the Polish People's Republic, the industry of fibre production developed in the settlement (\\"Unia\\", \\"Piast\\" manufacturers). In modern days, the fibre manufacturing industry is near non-existent. Other industries located in G≈Çubczyce including heating machinery production (\\"Galmet\\" and \\"Electromet\\").

In organometallic chemistry, a \\"constrained geometry complex\\" (CGC) is a kind of catalyst used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene.Klosin, J.; Fontaine, P. P.; Figueroa, R., \\"Development of Group Iv Molecular Catalysts for High Temperature Ethylene-Œë-Olefin Copolymerization Reactions\\", Accounts of Chemical Research 2015, 48, 2004-2016. The catalyst was one of the first major departures from metallocene-based catalysts and ushered in much innovation in the development of new plastics. Structure CGC complexes feature a pi-bonded moiety (e.g. cyclopentadienyl) linked to one of the other ligands on the same metal centre in such a way that the angle at this metal between the centroid of the pi-system and the additional ligand is smaller than in comparable unbridged complexes. More specifically, the term CGC was used for ansa-bridged cyclopentadienyl amido complexes, although the definition goes far beyond this class of compounds. The term CGC is frequently used in connection with other more or less related ligand systems that may or may not be isolobal and/or isoelectronic with the ansa-bridged cyclopentadienyl amido ligand system. Furthermore, the term is frequently used for related complexes with long ansa-bridges that induce no strain. Ansa- bridged cyclopentadienyl amido complexes are known for the Group 3, 4, 5, 6 and some Group 8 metals, with the Group 4 congeners being the most studied ones. Applications Like Group 4 metallocenes, suitable Group 4 CGCs may be activated for the polymerisation of ethylene and alpha-olefins by reaction with co-catalysts, e.g. methylaluminoxane (MAO), tris(pentafluorophenyl)boranes, and trityl borates. The catalytic systems based on CGCs, however, display incorporation of alpha-olefin comonomers to a greater extend than comparable metallocene based systems. This superiority of CGCs in copolymerisation reactions is ascribed to (i) a high accessibility of the reactive centre and (ii) a low tendency of the bulk polymer chain to undergo chain transfer reactions. CGC derived polymers are currently marketed by The Dow Chemical Company as part of their INSITE technology.Chum, P. S., W. J. Kruper, and M. J. Guest \\"Materials properties derived from INSITE metallocene catalysts.\\" Advanced Materials 12.23 (2000): 1759-1767. Beyond the use of CGCs for polymerisation reactions, a number of other transformations catalysed by CGCs (both of Group 3 and 4 metals) have been reported from academic laboratories. These include the application of CGCs as catalysts for hydrogenation of imines, hydroboration of alkenes, carboalumination of alkenes, hydrosilylation of alkenes, hydroamination/cyclisation of alpha ,omega-aminoalkenes and dimerisation of terminal alkynes. History The first CGC was reported by Shapiro and Bercaw for a scandium complex.Shapiro, P. J.; Bunel, E.; Schaefer, W. P.; Bercaw, J.

In a Boolean-valued model, the truth values of propositions are not limited to \\"true\\" and \\"false\\", but instead take values in some fixed complete Boolean algebra. Boolean-valued models were introduced by Dana Scott, Robert M. Solovay, and Petr Vopƒõnka in the 1960s in order to help understand Paul Cohen's method of forcing. They are also related to Heyting algebra semantics in intuitionistic logic. Definition Fix a complete Boolean algebra BB here is assumed to be nondegenerate; that is, 0 and 1 must be distinct elements of B. Authors writing on Boolean-valued models typically take this requirement to be part of the definition of \\"Boolean algebra\\", but authors writing on Boolean algebras in general often do not. and a first-order language L; the signature of L will consist of a collection of constant symbols, function symbols, and relation symbols. A Boolean-valued model for the language L consists of a universe M, which is a set of elements (or names), together with interpretations for the symbols. Specifically, the model must assign to each constant symbol of L an element of M, and to each n-ary function symbol f of L and each n-tuple <a0,...,an-1> of elements of M, the model must assign an element of M to the term f(a0,...,an-1). Interpretation of the atomic formulas of L is more complicated. To each pair a and b of elements of M, the model must assign a truth value a = b to the expression a = b; this truth value is taken from the Boolean algebra B. Similarly, for each n-ary relation symbol R of L and each n-tuple <a0,...,an-1> of elements of M, the model must assign an element of B to be the truth value R(a0,...,an-1). Interpretation of other formulas and sentences The truth values of the atomic formulas can be used to reconstruct the truth values of more complicated formulas, using the structure of the Boolean algebra. For propositional connectives, this is easy; one simply applies the corresponding Boolean operators to the truth values of the subformulae. For example, if œÜ(x) and œà(y,z) are formulas with one and two free variables, respectively, and if a, b, c are elements of the model's universe to be substituted for x, y, and z, then the truth value of : \\\\phi(a)\\\\land\\\\psi(b,c) is simply : \\\\\\\\phi(a)\\\\land\\\\psi(b,c)\\\\=\\\\\\\\phi(a)\\\\\\\\ \\\\land\\\\ \\\\\\\\psi(b,c)\\\\ The completeness of the Boolean algebra is required to define truth values for quantified formulas. If œÜ(x) is a formula with free variable x (and possibly other free variables that are suppressed), then : \\\\\\\\exists x\\\\phi(x)\\\\=\\\\bigvee_{a\\\\in M}\\\\\\\\phi(a)\\\\, where the right-hand side is to be understood as the supremum in B of the set of all truth values œÜ(a) as a ranges over M. The truth value of a formula is sometimes referred to as its probability. However, these are not probabilities in the ordinary sense, because they are not real numbers, but rather elements of the complete Boolean algebra B. Boolean-valued models of set theory Given a complete Boolean algebra B there is a Boolean-valued model denoted by VB, which is the Boolean- valued analogue of the von Neumann universe V. (Strictly speaking, VB is a proper class, so we need to reinterpret what it means to be a model appropriately.) Informally, the elements of VB are \\"Boolean-valued sets\\". Given an ordinary set A, every set either is or is not a member; but given a Boolean-valued set, every set has a certain, fixed \\"probability\\" of being a member of A. Again, the \\"probability\\" is an element of B, not a real number. The concept of Boolean-valued sets resembles, but is not the same as, the notion of a fuzzy set. The (\\"probabilistic\\") elements of the Boolean-valued set, in turn, are also Boolean-valued sets, whose elements are also Boolean- valued sets, and so on. In order to obtain a non-circular definition of Boolean-valued set, they are defined inductively in a hierarchy similar to the cumulative hierarchy. For each ordinal Œ± of V, the set VBŒ± is defined as follows. * VB0 is the empty set. *VBŒ±+1 is the set of all functions from VBŒ± to B. (Such a function represents a \\"probabilistic\\" subset of VBŒ±; if f is such a function, then for any x ‚àà VBŒ±, the value f(x) is the probability that x is in the set.) * If Œ± is a limit ordinal, VBŒ± is the union of VBŒ≤ for Œ≤ < Œ±. The class VB is defined to be the union of all sets VBŒ±. It is also possible to relativize this entire construction to some transitive model M of ZF (or sometimes a fragment thereof). The Boolean-valued model MB is obtained by applying the above construction inside M. The restriction to transitive models is not serious, as the Mostowski collapsing theorem implies that every \\"reasonable\\" (well-founded, extensional) model is isomorphic to a transitive one. (If the model M is not transitive things get messier, as M's interpretation of what it means to be a \\"function\\" or an \\"ordinal\\" may differ from the \\"external\\" interpretation.) Once the elements of VB have been defined as above, it is necessary to define B-valued relations of equality and membership on VB. Here a B-valued relation on VB is a function from VB √ó VB to B. To avoid confusion with the usual equality and membership, these are denoted by x = y and x ‚àà y for x and y in VB. They are defined as follows: :x ‚àà y is defined to be ‚àët‚ààDom(y) x = t ‚àß y(t) (\\"x is in y if it is equal to something in y\\"). :x = y is defined to be x ‚äÜ y ‚àß  y‚äÜ x (\\"x equals y if x and y are both subsets of each other\\"), where :x ‚äÜ y is defined to be ‚àèt‚ààDom(x) x(t) ‚áí t ‚àà y (\\"x is a subset of y if all elements of x are in y\\") The symbols ‚àë and ‚àè denote the least upper bound and greatest lower bound operations, respectively, in the complete Boolean algebra B. At first sight the definitions above appear to be circular:  ‚àà  depends on  = , which depends on  ‚äÜ , which depends on  ‚àà . However, a close examination shows that the definition of  ‚àà  only depends on  ‚àà  for elements of smaller rank, so  ‚àà  and  =  are well defined functions from VB√óVB to B. It can be shown that the B-valued relations  ‚àà  and  =  on VB make VB into a Boolean-valued model of set theory. Each sentence of first-order set theory with no free variables has a truth value in B; it must be shown that the axioms for equality and all the axioms of ZF set theory (written without free variables) have truth value 1 (the largest element of B). This proof is straightforward, but it is long because there are many different axioms that need to be checked. Relationship to forcing Set theorists use a technique called forcing to obtain independence results and to construct models of set theory for other purposes. The method was originally developed by Paul Cohen but has been greatly extended since then. In one form, forcing \\"adds to the universe\\" a generic subset of a poset, the poset being designed to impose interesting properties on the newly added object. The wrinkle is that (for interesting posets) it can be proved that there simply is no such generic subset of the poset. There are three usual ways of dealing with this: * syntactic forcing A forcing relation p\\\\Vdash\\\\phi is defined between elements p of the poset and formulas œÜ of the forcing language. This relation is defined syntactically and has no semantics; that is, no model is ever produced. Rather, starting with the assumption that ZFC (or some other axiomatization of set theory) proves the independent statement, one shows that ZFC must also be able to prove a contradiction. However, the forcing is \\"over V\\"; that is, it is not necessary to start with a countable transitive model. See Kunen (1980) for an exposition of this method. * countable transitive models One starts with a countable transitive model M of as much of set theory as is needed for the desired purpose, and that contains the poset. Then there do exist filters on the poset that are generic over M; that is, that meet all dense open subsets of the poset that happen also to be elements of M. * fictional generic objects Commonly, set theorists will simply pretend that the poset has a subset that is generic over all of V. This generic object, in nontrivial cases, cannot be an element of V, and therefore \\"does not really exist\\". (Of course, it is a point of philosophical contention whether any sets \\"really exist\\", but that is outside the scope of the current discussion.) Perhaps surprisingly, with a little practice this method is useful and reliable, but it can be philosophically unsatisfying. =Boolean-valued models and syntactic forcing= Boolean-valued models can be used to give semantics to syntactic forcing; the price paid is that the semantics is not 2-valued (\\"true or false\\"), but assigns truth values from some complete Boolean algebra. Given a forcing poset P, there is a corresponding complete Boolean algebra B, often obtained as the collection of regular open subsets of P, where the topology on P is defined by declaring all lower sets open (and all upper sets closed). (Other approaches to constructing B are discussed below.) Now the order on B (after removing the zero element) can replace P for forcing purposes, and the forcing relation can be interpreted semantically by saying that, for p an element of B and œÜ a formula of the forcing language, :p\\\\Vdash\\\\phi\\\\iff p\\\\leq\\\\phi where œÜ is the truth value of œÜ in VB. This approach succeeds in assigning a semantics to forcing over V without resorting to fictional generic objects. The disadvantages are that the semantics is not 2-valued, and that the combinatorics of B are often more complicated than those of the underlying poset P. =Boolean-valued models and generic objects over countable transitive models= One interpretation of forcing starts with a countable transitive model M of ZF set theory, a partially ordered set P, and a \\"generic\\" subset G of P, and constructs a new model of ZF set theory from these objects. (The conditions that the model be countable and transitive simplify some technical problems, but are not essential.) Cohen's construction can be carried out using Boolean-valued models as follows. * Construct a complete Boolean algebra B as the complete Boolean algebra \\"generated by\\" the poset P. * Construct an ultrafilter U on B (or equivalently a homomorphism from B to the Boolean algebra {true, false}) from the generic subset G of P. * Use the homomorphism from B to {true, false} to turn the Boolean-valued model MB of the section above into an ordinary model of ZF. We now explain these steps in more detail. For any poset P there is a complete Boolean algebra B and a map e from P to B+ (the non-zero elements of B) such that the image is dense, e(p)‚â§e(q) whenever p‚â§q, and e(p)e(q)=0 whenever p and q are incompatible. This Boolean algebra is unique up to isomorphism. It can be constructed as the algebra of regular open sets in the topological space of P (with underlying set P, and a base given by the sets Up of elements q with q‚â§p). The map from the poset P to the complete Boolean algebra B is not injective in general. The map is injective if and only if P has the following property: if every r‚â§p is compatible with q, then p‚â§q. The ultrafilter U on B is defined to be the set of elements b of B that are greater than some element of (the image of) G. Given an ultrafilter U on a Boolean algebra, we get a homomorphism to {true, false} by mapping U to true and its complement to false. Conversely, given such a homomorphism, the inverse image of true is an ultrafilter, so ultrafilters are essentially the same as homomorphisms to {true, false}. (Algebraists might prefer to use maximal ideals instead of ultrafilters: the complement of an ultrafilter is a maximal ideal, and conversely the complement of a maximal ideal is an ultrafilter.) If g is a homomorphism from a Boolean algebra B to a Boolean algebra C and MB is any B-valued model of ZF (or of any other theory for that matter) we can turn MB into a C -valued model by applying the homomorphism g to the value of all formulas. In particular if C is {true, false} we get a {true, false}-valued model. This is almost the same as an ordinary model: in fact we get an ordinary model on the set of equivalence classes under  =  of a {true, false}-valued model. So we get an ordinary model of ZF set theory by starting from M, a Boolean algebra B, and an ultrafilter U on B. (The model of ZF constructed like this is not transitive. In practice one applies the Mostowski collapsing theorem to turn this into a transitive model.) We have seen that forcing can be done using Boolean-valued models, by constructing a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean- valued models are essentially equivalent. NotesReferences * Bell, J. L.

It featured a unique compressor arrangement, starting with a low- compression impeller in the intake, followed by a \\"diagonal\\" stage similar to a centrifugal compressor, and then a three-stage axial compressor. Many of the German jet-powered aircraft designs at the end of the war were designed to use the HeS 011, but the HeS 011 engine was not ready for production before the war ended in Europe and only small numbers of prototypes were produced. Design and development Starting in 1936, Junkers started a jet engine development project under the direction of Wagner and M√ºller, who worked on axial compressor designs. By 1940 they had progressed to the point of having a semi-working prototype, which could not run under its own power and required an external supply of compressed air. Meanwhile, Hans Mauch, in charge of engine development at the RLM, decided that all engine development should take place at existing engine companies. In keeping with this new policy, he forced Junkers to divest itself of their internal engine teams. M√ºller and half of the existing Junkers team decamped and were happily accepted by Ernst Heinkel, who had started German jet development when he set up a lab for Hans von Ohain in 1937. The two teams worked on their designs in parallel for some time, von Ohain's as the HeS 8 (or 109-001), and the Junkers team as the HeS 30 (109-006). Heinkel's efforts were later re-organized at Hirth Motoren. Helmut Schelp, who had taken over from Mauch, felt that the BMW 003 and Junkers Jumo 004 would reach production at about the same power levels long before either of the Heinkel projects would be ready, and cancelled both of them. He outlined a new development plan with three engine classes; the 003 and 004 were \\"Class 1\\" engines of under 1000 kg thrust suitable for small fighters, but only really useful in twin-engine designs. Schelp was much more interested developing a \\"Class II\\" engine of 1000‚Äì2000 kg, larger designs able to power a full-sized fighter design with a single engine. Schelp was also interested in seeing one of his own pet projects, the diagonal compressor, adopted. Schelp had earlier convinced Heinkel to put some effort into another pet project of his, a twin-compressor single-turbine turboprop, but had given up on this and instead offered Heinkel his new concept as a consolation prize. A Riedel two- stroke APU motor, which was installed atop the 011's intake passage for starting the turbojet In some ways, the HeS 011 can be considered a combination of the two teams' designs, a three-stage axial compressor from M√ºller's team, combined with a single-stage centrifugal compressor from von Ohain's, the two driven by a single two-stage turbine. The engine operated at somewhat higher thrust levels, about , as opposed to about thrust for the 003 and 004 respectively. The 011 shared two features with the Jumo 004, with an engine-mounted Riedel two-stroke engine functioning as an APU to get the central shaft turning during engine startup, but mounted above the intake orifice within a Heinkel-crafted prefabricated sheet-metal intake passage instead of inside the intake diverter as the 004 had done, and also had a variable geometry exhaust nozzle, with a restrictive body of differing aerodynamic shape to the 004's Zwiebel (onion) unit, that likewise traveled fore and aft in the nozzle to vary the thrust. Plans were also made for a turboprop version, the HeS 021, but the workload at Heinkel was so high that this project was later given to Daimler-Benz to complete. Prototypes were available in 1944, and tested using a Heinkel He 111 bomber, mounting the engine on the external hardpoints under the fuselage. Over the next year, practically all German aircraft designers based their projects on the 011, very much as had been done only a year or two previously with projected piston-engined designs, such as those of the twin-engined Bomber B program, widely based on the equally experimental Junkers Jumo 222 twenty-four cylinder powerplant. Advanced high-output (>1,500 kW) aviation piston engines and more advanced turbojets proved to be something the German aviation engine industry would have considerable challenges developing into combat-reliable engines throughout the war years. As a result, and like the nearly three hundred experimental examples built of the complex Jumo 222 piston engine, the HeS 011 turbojet never entered production, with only 19 prototypes built in total. One of these was mounted in the Messerschmitt Me P.1101 that was taken to the United States, forming the basis of the Bell X-5. In all, only nineteen HeS 011s were completed.Christopher, p. 74 Two museum-preserved examples survive in the United States: one at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, and one at the EAA Aviation Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

The stadium is the home ground of C√°diz CF. The stadium was originally inaugurated 3 September 1955. It has since then been completely rebuilt twice. With a capacity of 20,724 seats, it is the 24th-largest stadium in Spain and the 5th- largest in Andalusia. History The stadium was inaugurated 3 September 1955. A month earlier on 6 August the national flag was raised at the stadium in the presence of Jos√© Le√≥n de Carranza (mayor of the city), Cazalla Morales (responsible for the work), the architects in charge (Mu√±oz Monasterio and Fern√°ndez Pujol) and the president and the vice president of C√°diz CF (Juan Ram√≥n Cilleruelo Montero and Rafael Garc√≠a Serrano). With a total of 15,000 spectators, the stadium built with an oval shape included a 400-metre athletics track between the pitch and the stands. The inaugural match was played against FC Barcelona, that ended in a loss of 0‚Äì4. With two goals from Villaverde, then Luis Su√°rez then a final goal from Kubala. The first rebuilding of the stadium took place in 1984, over the course of 4 months the main stand was demolished and rebuilt and the other stands were redesigned, at the same time the athletics track was removed and the pitch was moved closer to the stands. The rebuilt stadium included a roof over the main stand. The stadium capacity after the first rebuilding was 23,000. On 8 February 2002, the mayor of the city, Te√≥fila Mart√≠nez, presented the first real project for the New Carranza. One of its key points was the enlargement of the commercial areas in the stadium, which total surface was estimated at 5,000 square meter. The second rebuilding of the stadium took place between 2003 and 2012 when all four stands were demolished and rebuilt starting with the south stand (Fondo Sur) and the east stand (Preferente) between 2003 and 2005. Then the north stand (Fondo Norte) was rebuilt between 2006 and 2008. The last stand to be rebuilt was the main stand (Tribuna) which is the largest one with 8,281 seats and thus far the only one with a roof, the construction took place between 2009 and 2012. The new stadium with a total capacity of 20,724 spectators has a total built up area of 94,938 square metres, it includes 31,555 m of underground parking for around 900 cars under the four stands, commercial areas located throughout the stadium totaling 23,349 m, and 28,714 m are used for a hotel located in the main stand. The total cost of the rebuilding was ‚Ç¨68 million, all paid for with public funds. The Spain national football team for the first time played an official match on the Ram√≥n de Carranza against Malta in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying on 15 November 2019. The game ended in 7:0 Spain victory. Access Ram√≥n de Carranza is easily accessible by public transport. By train * The stadium has a nearby train station (estaci√≥n de Estadio) where all commuter trains on the C√°diz-Jerez line stops, some regional trains on the C√°diz-Seville line also stops at the stadium station.

Owned by Merrimack Valley Communications, the station existed from October 1969 to June 1970. History The station first signed on the air November 6, 1969, after several delays. WXPO operated from two studio facilities: its offices and master production facilities were located on Dutton Street in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts; however, its transmitter and \\"main\\" studio was located on Governor Dinsmore Road in Windham, New Hampshire to comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations requiring that a station's transmitter be located within 15 miles of the city of license. The original vision for the station was to air business news programming, known as \\"Info-50\\" during the daytime hours, and a general entertainment format ‚Äì including sports ‚Äì during the late afternoon and evening hours. Its afternoon program, Treehouse 50, gained a cult following among Boston-area college students, as it featured slapstick comedy and the Warner Bros. Cartoons that had been released to television stations at that time. The station also attempted to do live remotes with some mixed success. In addition, WXPO was infamous for a New Year's Eve show that, according to some who watched, had started to become particularly strange by 1:00 a.m. WXPO also attempted a news operation; in addition to the financial news programming, it was the first station to provide news updates every hour (a precursor to the 24 Hour News Source format used by many stations around the United States in the 1990s and ten years before CNN launched as the first all- news cable channel), and was the first New England television station to air a primetime newscast at 10 p.m. (WKBG-TV ‚Äì channel 56, now WLVI ‚Äì also attempted such a newscast during this time, but would not launch theirs for another two months). WXPO did not have any news film and relied solely on slides of photographs provided by the Associated Press for visuals. The station's signal coverage in many parts of Greater Boston was spotty at best. The Lowell studio was located less than 1,000 feet from the WLLH transmitter, making high- quality production impossible during the day due to RF interference with the cameras. Advertisers were scared off when the Lowell Sun blacklisted anyone who advertised on the station. Bills went unpaid for several months. In January 1970, in the wake of the failure of negotiations to bring in new investors and ameliorate channel 50's financial difficulties, WXPO cut its broadcast day from 12 hours to 6 and dropped several local and syndicated shows. 90 percent of WXPO's staff was removed from the payroll, although many continued with the station, believing it could pull through. However, the spring of that year saw the closure of the Lowell studio, and bankruptcy proceedings claimed the station. It either went off the air in May, or in June when the power company pulled the plug at the Windham studios during a Maverick rerun, taking WXPO off the air. Merrimack Valley Communications offered the WXPO-TV facility and permit for sale, including with ads in Broadcasting magazine; at the end of December 1971, it filed with the Federal Communications Commission to sell majority control to Vendelco, Inc. The FCC approved the transfer to Vendelco in August 1972. On July 17, 1973, channel 50 returned to the air with a test transmission, with plans to return the station to the air later that year, possibly as New Hampshire's CBS affiliate. Those plans were never realized, and the WXPO-TV construction permit was deleted by the FCC on November 25, 1974. The channel would remain silent until September 1983, when WNDS (now WWJE-DT) began operations.

Ritchie Patterson is the Director of CLASSE. The Wilson Synchrotron Lab, which houses both the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and CHESS, is named after Robert R. Wilson, known for his work as a group leader in the Manhattan Project, for being the first director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and for contributing to the design of CESR. LEPP The Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics (LEPP) is a high-energy physics laboratory studying fundamental particles and their interactions. In operation below the athletic fields on campus is the 768 meter Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). CESR is an electron-positron collider operating at a center-of-mass energy in the range of 3.5-12 GeV. Completed in 1979, CESR stores beams accelerated by the Cornell Synchrotron. Adding to a long history of significant developments, such as superconducting radio frequency cavities and pretzel orbits, the accelerator group is now developing an entirely new type of superconducting linear accelerator called the Energy Recovery Linear accelerator (ERL). The group is also involved in the design of damping rings, tracking simulations, RF cavities, and accelerator operation for the International Linear Collider (ILC). Cornell University has the largest graduate program in accelerator physics in the US. CHESS The Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) is a high- intensity, high-energy X-ray light source. The lab provides synchrotron radiation facilities for multidisciplinary scientific research, with a particular focus on protein crystallographic studies under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). CHESS was built between 1978 and 1980 as a synchrotron x-ray facility tied to the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) High-Energy Physics program (sometimes referred to, and better known as, particle physics), which produces an electron energy of 5.5 GeV. The original laboratory, CHESS West, included three instrumented beamlines [with] six independent experimental stations. The CHESS East laboratory was constructed during 1988‚Äì1989, adding two beam lines and four instrumented experimental stations. CHESS East contains a biohazard level BL3 facility (built with funds from the NIH). Construction began in 1999 for an addition to the facility called the \\"G-line\\" to provide a new beam line and three additional experimental stations.

In the mid-1930s, the Goodyear Aircraft Company built a family of small non-rigid airships that the company used for advertising the Goodyear name. In 1937 the United States Navy awarded a contract for two different airships, K class blimp designated K-2 and a smaller blimp based upon Goodyear's smaller commercial model airship used for advertising and passenger carrying. The smaller blimp was designated by the Navy as L-1 The L-1 was delivered in April 1938 and operated from the Navy's lighter-than-air facility at Lakehurst, New Jersey. In the meantime, the Navy ordered two more L-Class blimps, the L-2 and L-3, on September 25, 1940. These were delivered in 1941. L-2 was lost in a nighttime mid-air collision with the G-1 on June 8, 1942. When the United States entered World War II, the Navy took over the operation of Goodyear's five commercial blimps. These were the Resolute, Enterprise, Reliance, Rainbow, and Ranger. These airships were given the designations L-4 through L-8 even though their characteristics and performance varied among them. The next four L-Class airships were built in the assembly and repair shops at NAS Moffett Field. These blimps, L-9 through L-12 were completed by April 1943. The last lot of L-Class airships were ordered from Goodyear under a contract of February 24, 1943. This was a lot of ten airships designated L-13 through L-22. All the blimps were delivered by the end of 1943. As training airships these blimps operated mainly from the two major lighter-than-air bases, Lakehurst and Moffett Field. While too small for any extensive operational use, they were used on some coastal patrols.

Organization  The Hanns Seidel Foundation comprises four major departments: =Academy for Politics and Current Affairs= The Academy for Politics and Current Affairs is organizing conferences, international symposia and workshops which bring together distinguished German and international experts to examine the problems and consequences of political developments. =Institute for Adult Civic Education= The Training Institute offers seminars for political training based on the values of Christianity. With each democracy being required to rely on the active participation of democratically minded citizens, we seek to encourage participants to show such a significant commitment and give them the necessary skills. All in all, some 52,000 participants attended the 1,351 seminars (2008). =Scholarship Organization= The aim of the programs for German scholars is to support junior academics with the right personal and academic qualifications who are willing to cooperate constructively and with dedication in forming our liberal state under the rule of law. There are a large number of applicants from which the Scholarship Organization tries to select those students which outstanding achievements, social political dedication and personal qualities. =Institute for International Contact and Co-operation= Beginning with the first development aid project in Togo in 1977, the Institute for International Contact and Co-operation has steadily expanded its geographical and conceptual framework. Project work in Africa still constitutes one of the main focal points today. In the Hanns Seidel Foundation‚Äôs concept of development policy, strengthening underlying social factors is regarded as just as important as promoting social political structures. This means improving, strengthening and utilizing human capacities, taking into account the social, political, cultural and economic conditions of the country in question. Promoting a sense of democratic community while preserving traditions which deserve to be preserved are among the principles of the Hanns Seidel Foundation‚Äôs development co-operation. All projects are designed in such a way that the countries or partner organizations can take them over themselves in the course of time.

The rules that govern what to do when this happens are laid out in the relevant codes of nomenclature. In botanical names In botanical nomenclature, an orthographical variant (abbreviated orth. var.) is a variant spelling of the same name.

Since the set of valid first-order formulas is recursively enumerable but not recursive, there exists no general algorithm to solve this problem. Therefore, the Davis‚ÄìPutnam algorithm only terminates on valid formulas. Today, the term \\"Davis‚ÄìPutnam algorithm\\" is often used synonymously with the resolution-based propositional decision procedure that is actually only one of the steps of the original algorithm. Overview Davis-Putnam procedure on example propositional ground instances. Top to bottom, Left: Starting from the formula (a \\\\lor b \\\\lor c) \\\\land (b \\\\lor \\\\lnot c \\\\lor \\\\lnot f) \\\\land (\\\\lnot b \\\\lor e), the algorithm resolves on b, and then on c. Since no further resolution is possible, the algorithm stops; since the empty clause couldn't be derived, the result is \\"satisfiable\\". Right: Resolving the given formula on b, then on a, then on c yields the empty clause; hence the algorithm returns \\"unsatisfiable\\". The procedure is based on Herbrand's theorem, which implies that an unsatisfiable formula has an unsatisfiable ground instance, and on the fact that a formula is valid if and only if its negation is unsatisfiable. Taken together, these facts imply that to prove the validity of œÜ it is enough to prove that a ground instance of ¬¨œÜ is unsatisfiable. If œÜ is not valid, then the search for an unsatisfiable ground instance will not terminate. The procedure roughly consists of these three parts: * put the formula in prenex form and eliminate quantifiers * generate all propositional ground instances, one by one * check if each instance is satisfiable The last part is probably the most innovative one, and works as follows (cf. picture): * for every variable in the formula ** for every clause c containing the variable and every clause n containing the negation of the variable *** resolve c and n and add the resolvent to the formula ** remove all original clauses containing the variable or its negation At each step, the intermediate formula generated is equisatisfiable, but possibly not equivalent, to the original formula. The resolution step leads to a worst-case exponential blow-up in the size of the formula. The Davis‚ÄìPutnam‚ÄìLogemann‚ÄìLoveland algorithm is a 1962 refinement of the propositional satisfiability step of the Davis‚ÄìPutnam procedure which requires only a linear amount of memory in the worst case. It still forms the basis for today's (as of 2015) most efficient complete SAT solvers.

He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Early years Petitti attended Rumson-Fair Haven High School, where he was a three-year starter as a two-way tackle. He was a two-time All-Division, All-Shore, All-County selection and was twice named to the All-New Jersey Group I team. He recorded 90 tackles during his final two seasons. He also practiced basketball. College career Petitti accepted a football scholarship from the University of Pittsburgh, where he became a four-year starter at left tackle. As a redshirt freshman, he started 12 games at left tackle. As a sophomore, he started 13 games. As a junior in 2003, he earned first-team All-Big East and All-Eastern College Athletic Conference honors. He was named the coaching staff's Co-Lineman of the Game for the Ball State contest and Co-Blocker of the Game against Syracuse. For the season he recorded 87 knockdowns with eight touchdown- resulting blocks and allowed 7.5 of the team's 43 quarterback sacks. In 2004, he missed the game against Temple University because of a concussion, ending a streak of 42 consecutive starts. He was a second-team All-American selection by The Sporting News and College Football News, third-team from The NFL Draft Report and Associated Press. He was a unanimous first-team All-Big East selection by the coaches. Petitti was also a three-time All-Big East pick, becoming the first school offensive lineman to achieve this recognition since Ruben Brown was a three-time selection from 1992 to 1994. He finished his college career after playing and starting in 49 games, missing just a single contest due to injury. Professional careerDallas Cowboys= Petitti was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (209 overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft, after dropping because of an injury-plagued senior season. He won the starting right tackle job over Jacob Rogers and Torrin Tucker. He made his first NFL start at offensive tackle in the season opener, making him the third rookie in franchise history to achieve that feat. By doing so, he became only the second rookie after Dave Widell in 1988, to start an opener at offensive tackle in franchise history. That year, he and Larry Allen were the only two offensive players for the Cowboys to play every offensive snap, although he struggled in the last month of the season. Because of his significant playing time as a rookie, Pettiti earned $271,287 in performance pay, doubling his signing bonus and minimum base salary. In 2006, the signing of Jason Fabini, combined with the play of Marc Colombo and rookie Pat McQuistan, made him expendable and led to his release on September 2, 2006. =New Orleans Saints= On September 4, 2006, Petitti ‚Äî along with Cowboys teammate Terrance Copper ‚Äî was claimed off waivers by the New Orleans Saints, reuniting him with new head coach and former Cowboys offensive coordinator Sean Payton. He was a backup behind Jon Stinchcomb and was declared inactive until the season finale against the Carolina Panthers. He was declared inactive in both playoff contests. He was waived on August 31, 2007. =St. Louis Rams= On October 24, 2007, he was signed by the St. Louis Rams to a two-year, $1.1 million contract, to fill the roster spot vacated the release of Claude Terrell, after he was released for allegedly assaulted his wife. He played in five games, with one start and also recovered one fumble. On July 23, 2008, he was waived/injured by the Rams, after tearing his Achilles tendon during the offseason conditioning program. =Florida Tuskers= Petitti was selected by the Florida Tuskers in the UFL Premiere Season Draft. He signed with the team on August 25, 2009. =Carolina Panthers= On December 15, 2009, he was signed by the Carolina Panthers to replace an injured Jeff Otah. He appeared in 5 games as a backup. He was re-signed on March 15, 2010, released on September 4 and signed once more on December 1. He wasn't re- signed after the season.

He had a few guitar instructors when he was little, and was told by one of them that he would have a hard time playing because \\"his fingers were too small\\". Grijalva, being the determined musician that he was, would practice until his fingers hurt.  Influences  Tracy gives credit to Eddie Van Halen (Van Halen) and Donny Simmons (Yankee Rose, Stormer) for influencing his playing, especially referring to Simmons as 'his idol'.  Career  He would later play in a variety of bands, including with future member of Great White, Jack Russell. He also put together the bands Love/Hate with singer Jizzy Pearl, and Swift Kick. He would play at almost any club he could find to get his publicity out. He also played with vocalist Rudy Torres and drummer Audie Desbrow (Great White) in Riff Raff, a very popular band around southern California in the early days of hard rock and heavy metal. Tracy then joined Dio. In his six years with the band, Tracy G was featured on two studio albums, (Strange Highways and Angry Machines), and one live album (Inferno: Last in Live). He left the band in 1999 when he was asked to play rhythm guitar while Craig Goldy took lead. Dio decided to bring back Goldy, who had played with him on the Dream Evil album.

In 1456, Vlad ≈¢epe≈ü defeated his rival Vladislav Dan at T√¢rg»ôor at the edge of Codrii VlƒÉsiei. This was also the place where Vlad defeated the Ottoman army that came to depose him. It is also thought that Vlad was assassinated there following a plot of the boyars. The forests were later a hideout for highwaymen, haiducs and other outlaws. Between 1692 and 1700, a paved road which linked the centre of Bucharest to the Mogo≈üoaia Palace of Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu was built through the forest. Named Podul Mogo»ôoaiei, it was made of oak wood. Most roads in the Balkans at that time became muddy in the spring and autumn, and the wood prevented this. Consequently, the road was one of the most important construction works of the area and a source of pride to Bucharesters. In 1842 the road was paved with cobblestone. It was later upgraded to asphalt. The road was renamed \\"Calea Victoriei\\" after the Romanian victory in the Independence War of 1877-78. Most of the forest was intact until the 19th century, when commerce involving cereals and wood began to develop in Wallachia and the forest was razed for the land to be used in agriculture. Of the old forests only a few small areas remain, mostly north of Bucharest, in localities such as Snagov, Pustnicul, Cernica, Romane≈üti and Comana. The surface of forests is currently just about. 35 000 ha. BƒÉneasa Forest, situated in the north of Bucharest, is in danger to be transformed in a park. The slicing of forest estates as a result of restitution of forestland to the pre-World War II owners creates major difficulties in the management of forests from the area, which imposes new rules in the unitary management of forests as well.(webpage has a translation button) References *BƒÉdicioiu, Alexandra. \\"Codrii VlƒÉsiei se √Æntorc\\".

It had an undergraduate enrollment of 4,824 in 2019.https://www.se.edu/about/ The University offers an array of baccalaureate-level programs that prepare students for a changing society. In addition, selected graduate level programs are provided to serve the needs of the region. History alt= On March 6, 1909, the Second Oklahoma State Legislature approved an act designating Durant as the location for a normal school to serve the following 12-county region: Atoka, Bryan, Carter, Choctaw, Latimer, LeFlore, Love, Marshall, McCurtain, McIntosh, Pittsburg, and Pushmataha. Southeastern Oklahoma State University first opened its doors to students on June 14, 1909, as Southeastern State Normal School. The early program of instruction consisted of four years of high school and the freshman and sophomore college years. The first sessions of the school were held in temporary quarters pending completion of Morrison Hall in January, 1911, long known as the Administration Building. The original purpose of Southeastern was the education of teachers for the public schools of Oklahoma. The two-year graduates were awarded life teaching certificates. In 1921, the institution became a four-year college and was renamed Southeastern State Teachers College. Construction on the college's library, now the Henry G. Bennett Memorial Library, was completed in 1928. The primary function remained that of teacher education and the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Education and Bachelor of Science in Education were authorized. The purpose of the college was expanded in 1939. Courses leading to two newly authorized non-education degrees - Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science - were added. At this time, the college was renamed Southeastern State College. In 1954, the curriculum was enlarged by the addition of a graduate program leading to the Master of Teaching degree. In 1969, the name of the degree was changed to Master of Education. alt= On May 27, 1968, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education designated Southeastern as an Area Community College. While retaining previous functions, the college moved in the direction of providing greater post-secondary educational opportunities by expanding its curriculum to include new programs in areas such as business, technology, aviation, and conservation. In 1971, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education requested that the state supported institutions of higher education review and evaluate their functions as members of the State System of Higher Education. Upon completion of the review, a comprehensive ‚ÄúPlan for the Seventies‚Äù was prepared by each institution and submitted to the Regents. On June 1, 1972, Southeastern submitted its plan to the Regents which was, subsequently, approved on March 29, 1973. The Master of Education degree was changed to the Master of Behavioral Studies and, subsequently, the University was approved to offer a graduate program in business which culminated in the degree of Master of Administrative Studies. Four options of the Master of Behavioral Studies degree were renamed Master of Education in August, 1979. The Master of Administrative Studies degree was revised and renamed Master of Business Administration in August, 1996. On August 15, 1974, the name of Southeastern State College was changed to Southeastern Oklahoma State University by an act of the Oklahoma State Legislature. Since 1974, Southeastern, through institutional reorganizations, has continued to diversify, so that, presently, there are three academic schools: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education and Behavioral Science. alt= Southeastern has a zero tolerance policy regarding student conduct. Punishments occur for violations of campus regulations including punishments of alleged violations which cannot be appealed, as per the guidelines set by the Regional University System of Oklahoma. Controversy occurred after football player Justin Pitrucha was suspended following felony charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within 2,000 feet of a school. However, instead of upholding the policy, Pitrucha was fully reinstated after the charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor. After the long 20-year tenure of President Leon Hibbs, Dr. Larry Williams served ten years as Southeastern's president. Dr. Glen D. Johnson served Southeastern for 9 years then in 2007 assumed the duties of Chancellor of the Oklahoma State System for Higher Education. Dr. Jesse Snowden succeeded Johnson as interim president. Dr. Michael Turner was selected as SE president in 2008 and inaugurated in January 2009. He announced his resignation June 2009, and Regents named Dr. Larry Minks as interim then permanent president. Minks served as president through June 30, 2014, and Sean Burrage began duties as the 20th president on July 1, 2014. =Presidents= # Marcus E.

Newsom April 2020 ‚Äì Present  Gender discrimination lawsuit  In April 2011, Dr. Rachel Tudor, an Assistant Professor of English, Humanities and Literature was denied tenure despite having been recommended for promotion and tenure twice in the prior two years by the Faculty Tenure and Promotion Committee, based on the university's criteria of teaching, scholarship and service. The committee, whose positive recommendations for tenure routinely approved by the Administration was overruled by the vice president of academic affairs Dr. Douglas McMillan, who had previously inquired with the university's Human Resources Department whether Dr. Tudor could be terminated because her lifestyle \\"offends his Baptist beliefs.\\" Justifying the tenure denial, McMillan has claimed that Tudor was unqualified, despite the original Tenure and Promotion Committee's findings, those of the Faculty Appeals Committee, and a resolution by the Faculty Senate in support of Tudor's application. Dr. Tudor has not worked at SE since May 2011, and has brought her case to the Oklahoma Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Department of Education, and the EEOC. On September 5, 2012, the EEOC issued a \\"Determination\\" that states Southeastern Oklahoma State University terminated Dr. Tudor's employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The EEOC specifically cited sex discrimination, religious discrimination, and retaliation. Although Dr. Tudor welcomed the EEOC's conciliation offers, Southeastern rejected the EEOC's best efforts. The EEOC forwarded the case to the Department of Justice for consideration. On March 30, 2015, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the university. The EEOC settled its suit with the university in August 2017. On November 20, 2017, a jury rendered a verdict of $1.165 million in favor of Dr. Tudor, finding that the university denied her tenure and the opportunity to reapply for tenure because of her gender, although it did not find the university created a hostile work environment.  NAACP protests  SE generated media attention in 2013 when the NAACP and Reverends Marshall Hatch and Ira Acree of the National Action Network spoke on behalf of five African-American college football students attending Southeastern, one of whom was from Chicago, regarding an incident which occurred on April 2, 2013. According to Durant Police, several people reported masked men came to their residences and demanded money and cell phones. The students were suspended and scholarships revoked. All five were charged in June 2013 with felony conspiracy to engage in a pattern of criminal offenses plus misdemeanor charges of wearing a mask, hood or covering for the purposes of coercion, intimidation or harassment, and four counts of assault and battery. During a preliminary hearing on October 16, 2013 all five men entered no-contest pleas to misdemeanor charges. The felony charges against them were dismissed as part of a plea agreement and each was given three-year deferred sentences on the misdemeanor charges and also sentenced to 90 days in jail. Arlene Barnum of the NAACP contested their suspensions from SE under grounds based on the denial of the right to an attorney during disciplinary proceedings. Five members of the NAACP protested on the SE campus in May 2013 outside graduation ceremonies. Academics Southeastern offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degree in a variety of disciplines. Southeastern offers over 60 undergraduate degree plans. The school also offers 15 different graduate programs, with options for all face to face classes, all online classes, or a mix of the two. The top five most popular majors for new students in the Fall of 2018 in order were Biology, Aviation, Occupational Safety and Health, Elementary Education, and General Business.https://www.se.edu/academic-affairs/wp- content/uploads/sites/15/2019/04/SE-Quick-Facts-Fall-2018.pdf The Safety department at Southeastern is ranked four out of five stars in a national ranking.American School Search.

In 1932 he gave the first North American performance of Maurice Ravel's Concerto in G under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky, the same day as Sylvan Levin did with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Early years Sanrom√°'s father, Jos√© Mar√≠a, was born in Barcelona, Spain, and studied at a Jesuit seminary but did not take his final orders to become a priest. After graduation from college, he became a political gadfly writing for a newspaper about the Spanish plebiscite. They recommended he take a hasty retreat to Puerto Rico with all expenses paid by the Spanish government. He settled in the town of Carolina, and later in the town of Fajardo. He sent for his girlfriend, Mar√≠a Torra de la Riba, but in 1894 women were not allowed to travel unmarried. They were married by proxy before she traveled to be with him. They had two sons, Juan Bautista born in Trujillo Alto in 1899 and Jes√∫s Mar√≠a born in Carolina in 1902. Jos√© Mar√≠a earned a living in Fajardo by publishing a newspaper and teaching. Jes√∫s Mar√≠a began playing his father's piano. Jos√©, realizing his son was talented, said, \\"If you are going to play the piano, then you shall go to school to study.\\" He enrolled him at a music school located in the town of Fajardo to take piano lessons. In 1913, at the age of 11, Sanrom√° made his debut in the Fajardo Municipal Theater.SANROMA, JESUS MARIA (1902 - 1984)  Sanrom√° debuts In January 1916, Sanrom√° debuted at the Puerto Rican Ateneo in San Juan, the island's capital. Unknown to him, Jos√© de Diego was amongst the public in the audience. So impressed was de Diego with Sanrom√° that he persuaded the government to give Sanrom√° a grant of 600 dolares. The grant was to be used to further his musical education in the United States. Sanrom√° enrolled in the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and studied piano with David Sequeira. He graduated in 1920 and was awarded the Mason and Hamlin Prize. Shortly after his graduation he earned the position of official pianist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, becoming the first person ever to receive such an honor. He continued studies with Polish pianist Antoinette Szumowska-Adamowska at NEC from 1920 to 1927, and later took additional classes with Alfred Cortot in Paris (June‚ÄìJuly 1927) and with Artur Schnabel in Berlin (September‚ÄìOctober 1927). Boston Symphony Orchestra Sanrom√° worked with various composers, such as Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev, but it was the future conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra (a subsection of the Boston Symphony Orchestra), Arthur Fiedler, with whom he was to develop an artistic relationship that was to last for many years. In 1932 he gave the first North American performance of Maurice Ravel's Concerto in G under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky, the same day as Sylvan Levin did with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was the soloist in the first complete recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, with Fiedler and the Boston Pops for RCA Victor in July 1935. They also made the first recording of Edward MacDowell's Second Concerto (1934).Jeremy Nicholas. Booklet notes to Hyperion CDA67165. Sanrom√° resigned as official pianist for the BSO after 20 years of service. During his amazing career Sanrom√° collaborated and recorded with composers such as Paul Hindemith, Walter Piston, Ernst Toch, Heitor Villa- Lobos, Hector Campos Parsi, Vladimir Dukelsky, Edward Burlingame Hill, John Carpenter, Juan Jos√© Castro, Ernst Bloch, Carlos Chavez, Igor Stravinsky, Pablo Casals and Leonard Bernstein.Music of Puerto Rico Sanrom√° Concerts In 1952, he returned to Puerto Rico and was named musical consultant of the Department of Music of the University of Puerto Rico. Sanrom√° presented a series of \\"Sanrom√° Concerts\\" until 1975. In 1956, he was named member of the organizing committee of the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico. He was also an active participant in the Pablo Casals Festivals. Sanrom√° recorded over 38 albums for RCA Victor and Columbia, besides his 13 albums devoted to 154 danzas by Juan Morel Campos. Jes√∫s Maria Sanrom√° Sanrom√° traveled and performed throughout the world. Amongst the 21 countries in which he performed were Germany, France, Austria, Spain, England, the United States, Canada, Venezuela and the rest of Latin America. Later years Among the many awards and recognitions bestowed upon Sanrom√° were Doctor Honoris Causa degrees from the New England Conservatory of Music, University of Puerto Rico, University of Miami, St. Peter's College and Boston College. Pope Paul VI named him a Knight of the Order of Saint Sylvester. Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Sanrom√° died on October 12, 1984 in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the age of 82. He was buried in the Porta Coeli Cemetery in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.

Before this, she had made many movies in her native Japan, especially Toho Studio's monster movies, such as Dagora, the Space Monster (1964) and Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964), both of which were also released under various other titles. In Ghidorah, she played a mystical princess, who could predict the future and was also a prophetess. When production of You Only Live Twice began, Wakabayashi was slated to play the role of Kissy Suzuki whilst her co-star Mie Hama played Suki, one of Tiger Tanaka's top agents. When learning English proved to be a major hurdle to Hama, the women switched roles, with Hama now playing the smaller part of Kissy and Wakabayashi playing the larger part of Suki. At her suggestion, the character of Suki was renamed Aki. They had acted together in King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (1965). In 1971 she made an appearance in an episode of Shirley's World. Wakabayashi made only one more film (and a guest TV appearance) before disappearing from both the big and small screen.

Zimbra was initially developed by LiquidSys, which changed their name to Zimbra, Inc. on 26 July 2005. The Zimbra Collaboration Suite was first released in 2005. The company was subsequently purchased by Yahoo! on September 17, 2007, and later sold to VMware on January 12, 2010. In July 2013, it was sold by VMware to Telligent Systems which changed its name to Zimbra, Inc. in September 2013. It was then acquired by Synacor on 18 August 2015. According to former Zimbra President and CTO Scott Dietzen, the name for Zimbra is derived from the song \\"I Zimbra\\" by Talking Heads.  Edition  The software consists of both client and server components, and at one time also offered a desktop email client, called Zimbra Desktop. Two versions of Zimbra are available: an open-source version, and a commercially supported version (\\"Network Edition\\") with closed-source components such as a proprietary Messaging Application Programming Interface connector to Outlook for calendar and contact synchronisation. The now discontinued Zimbra Desktop was a full- featured free desktop email client. Development was discontinued under VMware's stewardship in 2013 but was restarted in February 2014, but was ended again by 2019. The web client featured an HTML5 offline mode starting with version 8.5. The Zimbra Web Client is a full-featured collaboration suite that supports email and group calendars. At one time it featured document-sharing using an Ajax web interface that enabled tool tips, drag-and-drop items, and right-click menus in the UI. Today it has document sharing, chat, and videoconferencing. Also included are advanced searching capabilities and date relations, online document authoring, \\"Zimlet\\" mashups, and a full administration UI. It is written using the Zimbra Ajax Toolkit. The Zimbra Server uses several open source projects (see the section, Included open source projects). It exposes a SOAP application programming interface to all its functionality and is also an IMAP and POP3 server. The server runs on many Linux distributions. It also can be run on a Windows Server, using a virtual machine and using container technology. It supports CalDAV, CardDAV and SMTP for messaging, LDAP for directory services, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD). Zimbra uses Postfix for its MTA functionality. It includes technology from ClamAV, SpamAssassin and DSPAM for anti-malware features and S/MIME for email signing and encryption. OS X Server support was dropped with version ZCS 7.0. Zimbra can synchronize mail, contacts, and calendar items with open- source mail clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Evolution and also with proprietary clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Apple Mail, either through proprietary connectors or using the ActiveSync protocol, both available exclusively in the commercially supported version. Zimbra also provides native two-way sync to many mobile devices.  Software license  The closed source variant Network edition is distributed under the Zimbra Network Edition EULA.

Darby is best remembered for scoring an unexpected late goal that deprived Kerry of a 5-in-a-row in the 1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. In 2005, it was voted the third greatest moment in GAA history. Playing career During his footballing career, Darby won Leinster Senior Football Championship titles with Offaly in 1972, 1973 and 1982, playing in various forward positions. He won his second All-Ireland medal in 1972 when Offaly defeated Kerry in the final. He had been an unused substitute in the 1971 final v Galway, Offaly's first-ever win. He was dropped from the county panel after the 1976 season. Darby was recalled to the Offaly team for the 1982 Leinster final, playing full-forward against Dublin. He pulled a hamstring in that match and missed the All-Ireland semi-final against Galway. His replacement Johnny Mooney played well in that match so Darby was left on the bench for the final. The 1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was a repeat of the previous year's encounter and was also significant in that a win for Kerry would give them an unprecedented fifth All-Ireland Final victory in a row. Kerry were winning by two points with two minutes to go when Darby ‚Äî who had arrived on the field of play as a substitute, with instructions to stay forward and try for a goal ‚Äî got behind his marker Tommy Doyle, caught a \\"high, lobbing, dropping ball\\", and scored one of the most famous goals of all time. It was his only kick of the match. Kerry fumbled the counterattack which allowed Offaly to win by one single point with a score of 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì17. In 2005, Darby's goal against Kerry was voted third in a poll to find the Top 20 GAA Moments. The expression \\"to do a S√©amus Darby\\" has been used in other fields. Darby's last match for Offaly was the Leinster semi- final against Dublin in 1984. He played club football for Rhode till 1986. He later played for Edenderry in 1989, and for Borrisokane in County Tipperary in 1991. Later life The 1982 All-Ireland and Darby's part in it received renewed attention in 2010 when the Kilkenny hurlers were aiming to complete their own five-in-a-row, also never realised. Darby was interviewed for the documentary Players of the Faithful. This aired in 2018 when Dublin's footballers had just won their fourth consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and would be bidding for their fifth in 2019. An episode of Laochra Gael dedicated to his life first aired on TG4 in 2019.

It is down the line from . History The London and Southampton Railway (L&SR;) was authorised on 25 July 1834. It was built and opened in stages, and the second section, that between (then known as Woking Common) and , was opened on 24 September 1838; there was only one intermediate station on this section, at Farnborough. On 4 June 1839, the L&SR; was renamed the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Brookwood Cemetery Railway - commemorative track Funeral trains from London to Woking Cemetery first ran in 1849. The opening of Brookwood Cemetery (and the associated London Necropolis railway station close to London Waterloo) led to an increase in the funeral traffic. A branch line left from the main line station to serve two stations within the cemetery, Brookwood Cemetery North and Brookwood Cemetery South. In June 1863, the LSWR agreed to provide a station on the main line, to serve both the adjacent cemetery and Brookwood village; this opened on 1 June 1864. A branch line to the north of the line at Brookwood was opened on 14 July 1890. It served Bisley Camp of the National Rifle Association. The station was reconstructed in 1903, with a new down platform, long, being built to the south of the original. It was connected to the up platform by a new subway, the footbridge being removed. This made room for the double-track main line to be quadrupled; the new tracks through the station ( between Brookwood East and Pirbright Junction) being brought into use on 15 November 1903. New pneumatic signalling between Woking and Basingstoke was provided between 1904 and 1907; the stretch between Farnborough and Woking was brought into use during June‚ÄìJuly 1907, and included a new signal box at Brookwood, having 35 working levers. This box, like the previous Brookwood East manual signalbox, was on the down side of the line. Operation of the Bisley branch was transferred to the War Office on 1 March 1917, but was returned to the LSWR on 8 August 1918. View towards London Waterloo in May 2006 The cemetery branch line (and stations) have now closed, but the main line station remains and is now a popular commuter station on the South Western Main Line between London Waterloo and Basingstoke, served by South Western Railway. The exit to the cemetery remains. Victorian postbox on the platform at Brookwood Station Services Trains run seven days a week. The typical Monday-Saturday off- peak service is: *4 trains per hour to London Waterloo. *2 trains per hour to Basingstoke. *2 trains per hour to Alton. On Sundays this becomes: *2 trains per hour to London Waterloo (joining at Woking). *1 train per hour to Basingstoke. *1 train per hour to Alton.

The aquarium is also home to the Entergy Giant Screen Theater, previously the Entergy IMAX theater, and exhibits for sea otters and African penguins  Katrina damage and aftermath  In 2005, the facilities were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Though the structure survived the initial hurricane and was on high ground above the subsequent flooding of most of the city, electricity outages continued and the backup power generators were unable to fully operate the sophisticated life support systems needed to keep the animals alive. Aquarium staffers were forced to evacuate the facility only to return four days later to discover that most of the 10,000 fish did not survive. The aquarium reopened on May 26, 2006. Since Hurricane Katrina, more species have been in the Caribbean and jellyfish exhibits, and there has been a large revamp to the Gulf of Mexico tank simulating ocean life below an oil rig platform.

Tissot indicatrix on Goode homolosine projection, 15¬∞ graticule. The Goode homolosine projection (or interrupted Goode homolosine projection) is a pseudocylindrical, equal-area, composite map projection used for world maps. Normally it is presented with multiple interruptions. Its equal-area property makes it useful for presenting spatial distribution of phenomena. Development The projection was developed in 1923 by John Paul Goode to provide an alternative to the Mercator projection for portraying global areal relationships. Goode offered variations of the interruption scheme for emphasizing the world‚Äôs land and the world‚Äôs oceans. Some variants include extensions that repeat regions in two different lobes of the interrupted map in order to show Greenland or eastern Russia undivided. The homolosine evolved from Goode‚Äôs 1916 experiments in interrupting the Mollweide projection. Because the Mollweide is sometimes called the \\"homolographic projection\\", Goode fused the two names \\"homolographic\\" and \\"sinusoidal\\" to create the name \\"homolosine\\". Common in the 1960s, the Goode homolosine projection is often called an \\"orange-peel map\\" because of its resemblance to the flattened rind of a hand-peeled orange. In its most common form, the map interrupts the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the entire east/west meridian of the map. Details Up to latitudes 40¬∞44‚Ä≤11.8‚Ä≥N/S, the map is projected according to the sinusoidal projection‚Äôs transformation. The higher latitudes are the top sections of a Mollweide projection, grafted to the sinusoidal midsection where the scale of the two projections matches. This grafting results in a kink in the meridians along the parallel of the graft. The projection‚Äôs equal-area property follows from the fact that its source projections are themselves both equal-area.

It was founded on November 27, 1919, on Thanksgiving Day, at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, now known as Oklahoma State University, in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Kappa Kappa Psi primarily operates as a recognition society providing service, leadership opportunities, and social programming for band members. Tau Beta Sigma, National Honorary Band Sorority, has been recognized as a sister organization since 1947, and the two organizations share National Headquarters in Stillwater Station, a converted historical Santa Fe rail depot that was purchased by the fraternity and sorority in 1991. Since 1919, more than 66,000 men and women have been initiated into Kappa Kappa Psi, with nearly 6,000 collegiate members active today. Members of Kappa Kappa Psi include President Bill Clinton; chancellor and eleventh president of Indiana University, Herman B Wells; composers John Williams and John Philip Sousa; conductor William Revelli; and jazz pianist and bandleader Count Basie.  History  Founding and expansion = William Scroggs, 1922 William A. Scroggs, a student at Oklahoma A&M; College, sought to establish an organization that would \\"bind [dear] friendship together indefinitely\\" and unite members across colleges and universities. After some initial planning, he consulted band president A. Frank Martin and Bohumil Makovsky, director of bands at Oklahoma A&M;, both of whom agreed to help with the creation of the fraternity. From Makovsky's band, 10 members were selected as the first members of Kappa Kappa Psi: William Alexander Scroggs, Andrew Franklin Martin, Raymond David Shannon, Clyde DeWitt Haston, Clayton Everett Soule, Carl Anderson Stevens, William Houston Coppedge, Dick Hurst, George Asher Hendrickson, and Iron Hawthorne Nelson. The founders accepted chemistry professor Hilton Ira Jones' suggestion to name the fraternity \\"Kappa Kappa Psi.\\" It was organized on November 27, 1919, and Scroggs was unanimously elected to serve as the President. Legal organization was completed on March 5, 1920, when the fraternity received its charter from the state of Oklahoma. The formal organization of the fraternity was celebrated on either March 23 or 25, 1920, with the initiation of the first membership class and a banquet. The uncertainty comes from an error in the article that makes it unclear whether the initiation and banquet took place on Tuesday the 23rd or on Thursday the 25th. Alpha chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi, 1920 The fraternity grew rapidly in its first years. Within ten years, there were 27 chapters spanning from the University of Washington in the west to Duke University in the east. Only 14 were installed during the Great Depression, while World War II put a further damper on fraternal activities. At the 1939 National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, plans were set into action to make Kappa Kappa Psi an international fraternity. Invitations were sent to colleges and universities in Canada and South America, but no chapters were ever installed at those institutions. = World War II = Before World War II, most college bands were military-style and exclusively male. When the war began, most band members left to serve in the armed forces, which greatly strained the fraternity‚Äîto the point that 90 percent of chapters were forced to suspend activities. The Grand Council granted those chapters that were forced to suspend their activities \\"war furlough\\" so that instead of treating the chapter as inactive, their service would be honored. War furlough enabled a chapter to seal its records and keep its materials in safekeeping for the duration of the war. Petitions for war furlough required the signatures of all active members, the director of bands or other faculty member who was an honorary member of the fraternity, as well as the signature of the college or university president. Only five chapters remained active during the war: the Alpha chapter at Oklahoma A&M; College, Alpha Beta at Butler University, Alpha Iota at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Alpha Omicron at Texas Technological College, and Alpha Pi at the University of Tulsa. With so many members serving overseas, including members of the Grand Council, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were canceled. Because of the number of men serving in the military, many band programs opened up to women during this time. At Texas Tech, a local sorority for women in the band was established as Tau Beta Sigma. The women of Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to be chartered as an auxiliary chapter of the fraternity, which was supported by founder A. Frank Martin, who was serving as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin wrote to fellow founder, William Scroggs, \\"If we do not meet this new situation and give recognition to the girls who are coming into the bands or make it possible to give aid or assistance to the many universities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and girls, we will be playing second fiddle within the next five years to some band fraternity that will grant membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have died.\\" The fraternity was unable to decide whether or not to accept Tau Beta Sigma's petition due to the severely reduced number of members and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national conventions. Ultimately, Tau Beta Sigma decided not to become an auxiliary chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and chartered as a national organization on March 26, 1946. They were officially recognized and accepted as a sister organization of the fraternity at the first national convention following the war in 1947. = Post-war expansion = After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi began an ambitious expansion program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which were led by a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful‚Äîin the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 by the end of 1957. May 1957 saw the first chapters at historically black universities: On May 19, at Langston University, Kappa Kappa Psi chartered its 97th chapter, Delta Alpha, on the campus of Langston University. On May 22, the 96th chapter, Gamma Omega, was established at Texas Southern University. On September 1, 1967, the 11 districts were consolidated into nine. These districts would again be consolidated in 1987, to six districts with regional names: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, North Central, Midwest, and Western. =Effect of Title IX= On June 23, 1972, Title IX was enacted and had tremendous repercussions for the women's rights movement. Title IX prevented organizations from excluding members based on sex. Although social fraternities were exempt from the law, Kappa Kappa Psi, as a recognition society, fell under its purview. Rutgers University's board of trustees decided that Rutgers should serve as a model for the rest of the United States in Title IX implementation and mandated that all organizations on campus become coeducational or face disciplinary actions. The men of the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi regarded this issue as minor given the ongoing Vietnam War. With dwindling numbers, Alpha Phi looked to the new women members of the Rutgers band as potential members. The national constitution of Kappa Kappa Psi prohibited women from holding membership, so the Alpha Phi chapter explored the possibility of establishing a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. This was unrealistic, as the undergraduate college for women prohibited the formation of or membership in any sorority. On October 8, 1972, the men of Alpha Phi voted to admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to administer any degree of ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, he learned that the first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi. At the national convention of 1973, the issues presented by Title IX were discussed by the Grand Chapter. The jurisdiction committee considered several options that would bring the fraternity into compliance, but were not receptive of the general idea. At the insistence of committee chair Richard Adler, from the Nu chapter at the University of Michigan, the jurisdiction committee presented the Grand Chapter with an amendment \\"without prejudice\\"‚Äîthat is, without recommendation for or against the amendment‚Äîthat would strike the section of the constitution that read, \\"All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex.\\" The committee simultaneously recommended that the delegation take no action to change the constitution or consider a merger with Tau Beta Sigma. The amendment was defeated, and a separate amendment was proposed and approved that changed the wording to say, \\"All active, alumni, inactive, and life members of the Fraternity be of the male sex.\\" This amendment was approved, allowing the fraternity to initiate women as honorary members. During the 1973‚Äì1975 biennium, pressure was put on Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of an equal number of members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger‚ÄîKappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing. The first women to join the fraternity were sisters of the Sigma chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at Arizona State University, who merged with the Beta Omicron chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi after a unanimous vote of both organizations. These women were Patricia A. Childress, Lydia L. Lennon, Leslie A. Anderson, Mary L. Duffala, Mary M. Ketterer, Kristina M. Zipsnis, Clara M. Bertilson, and Toni Ryon, who were initiated into Beta Omicron on August 26, 1977. On August 27, Lea F. Fuller was initiated. The first woman to participate in the formal probationary membership process and become a member of Kappa Kappa Psi was Darragh Hill Young, who was initiated into the Beta Tau chapter at Wichita State University on September 1, 1977. =Early 21st century= Beginning with the installation of the Kappa Pi chapter at Claflin University on February 24, 2001, 57 new chapters have been installed in the 21st century. In 2006, Kappa Kappa Psi celebrated its inaugural National Month of Musicianship during the month of November, the month in which the fraternity was founded. The annual month-long event is intended to promote music and university bands. Local chapters celebrate the National Month of Musicianship in various ways, such as creating lab bands for student conductors, organizing reading bands, and hosting master classes. Also in 2008, Kappa Kappa Psi joined other Greek organizations in sponsoring hazingprevention.org, a national anti-hazing organization. Dr. Malinda Matney, past National President and former member of the Kappa Kappa Psi Board of Trustees, has served on the hazingprevention.org Board of Directors since 2009. On December 1, 2011, following the death of Florida A&M; University drum major Robert Champion, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity. In January 2012, the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity. After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations, the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the fraternity. Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled. Furthermore, the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017. Members who joined the fraternity after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any fraternity events due to the shutdown of the chapter. No criminal charges were filed due to the delay in reporting and investigation.  Programs  National scope = National Intercollegiate Band  First National Intercollegiate Band, 1947 In 1922, plans were made to hold the first national intercollegiate band contest. A brief dispatch in the 1922 Baton explained, \\"Sometime within the next two years the Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternity will hold a National Intercollegiate Band Contest. This enterprise will be the first of its kind ever attempted. As Music is becoming the foremost Art in America, our Fraternity aims to assist in so spreading the good work.\\" Nothing came of these early plans, however, and the idea of a national intercollegiate band was not revisited until the 1940s. Beginning in 1933, the first intercollegiate band was established, with musicians from the University of Colorado (home of the Alpha Iota chapter), the University of Denver (Alpha Lambda), Colorado State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (Kappa), Colorado State College of Education (Alpha Theta), the Colorado School of Mines (Xi), and the University of Utah participating. In 1934, the University of Utah left the intercollegiate band and the University of Wyoming (Alpha Nu) took its place. The concerts held by this intercollegiate band were sponsored by the local chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and many members of the fraternity were involved with the ensemble, including F. Lee Bowling, who served as the band's manager. F. Lee Bowling was elected Grand President of the fraternity in 1941 and presented a plan to hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The plan was endorsed by the delegation to be executed at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed and gave a concert on the evening of Friday, March 7, 1947. Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions‚Äîmembership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required. In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma sponsored the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which traveled to the French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, and in front of the Prince's Palace of Monaco.\\"National Intercollegiate Marching Band French Riviera-Principality of Monaco Working Itinerary #4\\" (DOC). Email attachment in After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks. The success of the National Intercollegiate Band led to districts creating their own bands. One such group was the Atlantic Coast Intercollegiate Band, formed in 1958 at the convention of Districts X and XI. The Atlantic Coast band comprised around one hundred musicians and was conducted by Paul V. Yoder. The convention was hosted by the Beta Chi chapter at the University of Virginia, and the convention and concert were co-sponsored by the Universities of Rutgers, Maryland, and Pittsburgh. In 2009, the North Central District organized the first North Central District Intercollegiate Band. The North Central District Intercollegiate Band is the only currently functioning district intercollegiate band and has performed at every North Central District convention since its inaugural.  Commissioning Program  Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have commissioned a new work for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun to add to the wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's An American Elegy, commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the Columbine High School massacre.  Stillwater Station  The Stillwater Santa Fe Depot is a historic building originally built in March 1900. In 1915, a brick depot was added. The depot was used as a passenger rail station until 1953.National Register of Historic Places, Stillwater Santa Fe Depot, Stillwater, Payne County, Oklahoma, National Register #80004293. The depot was purchased at auction by five Stillwater residents, including three Alpha chapter alumni, in November 1991. Stillwater Station replaced Oklahoma State University's Seretean Center for the Performing Arts as the National Headquarters of the two organizations. The fraternity and sorority share office space, a conference room, and storage space in the converted station, which also hosts the organizations' archives. The brick path leading to the building's entrance has become a \\"Walk of Fame\\" with engraved bricks purchased by individuals or chapters. In 2006, Kappa Kappa Psi purchased a retired Detroit, Toledo and Ironton caboose to provide additional space for the fraternity's history and archives program. After it was purchased, the caboose was placed on newly laid tracks outside the headquarters and wired for electricity, phone, and internet. The caboose is intended to host archives, artifacts, and chapter histories, as well as displays of historical items. = Local programs and activities = The mission statement and five purposes of Kappa Kappa Psi shape the activities of local chapters. Chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi provide service and support to the bands at its hosting institutions, from major projects like undertaking major renovations of rehearsal spaces used by the institution's bands to relatively minor support such as providing apples and water to athletic bands or cleaning practice rooms. Some chapters also include general community service in their activities, such as sponsoring blood drives and other activities. The fifth purpose of the fraternity charges chapters and members is to \\"provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band work,\\" and chapters fulfill this charge through social programming such as hosting receptions after band concerts, sponsoring dances and socials for band members or their campus community in general, or by hosting concerts and providing food. Some chapters, especially southern chapters, also take part in step shows.  Jewelry and symbols  Membership pins = Crown Pearl Badge Membership Recognition Pin The Crown Pearl Badge is considered the \\"official means of identifying oneself with the Fraternity.\\" The fraternity badge is in the shape of an ancient Venetian harp, with a musical staff of gold lines on black enamel in the center of the badge, with the Greek letters \\"Kappa Kappa Psi\\" in gold across the staff. Five pearls adorn the bar across the top of the badge, and ten gems are set in the harp's semicircle. In the upper left corner, the Greek letters \\"Alpha Epsilon Alpha\\" appear in gold on black enamel. A golden baton penetrates the badge diagonally from right to left. Unlike other Greek organizations, however, purchase of the badge is optional for members of Kappa Kappa Psi. Many brothers instead wear the recognition pin, which is a gold lapel pin in the shape of the fraternity's coat of arms. Prospective Membership Pin Membership Candidates may wear a lapel pin that has a musical staff and bass clef of silver on a background of blue enamel. The notes A, E, and A are placed on the staff in silver.\\" This is the only piece of regalia that Membership Candidates are allowed to wear‚Äîall other jewelry is restricted to initiated members, and even the coat of arms and letters (usually worn in the form of embroidered or ironed-on blocked letters) are restricted unless there is a clear indication that the wearer is a Membership Candidate or colony member. = Flag = alt=Fraternity Flag of Kappa Kappa Psi. The Fraternity Flag was created by G. R. Schaag, a member of the Eta Sigma chapter at the University of Central Florida. The idea of a national flag was raised with the History and Traditions committee by Schaag at the 1987 national convention, but the committee ultimately decided not to take the idea to the national delegation. Schaag quickly drafted a motion to consider a national flag, which was presented by the chapter's delegate and passed. In 1989, Schaag presented a design for a flag, which won the committee's recommendation over other submissions and was accepted by the national chapter. Cited in The upper half of the flag consists of a white field with the Greek letters \\"Kappa Kappa Psi\\" inscribed in an arc. On the lower half, three alternating stars of white, blue, and white appear on a blue field, with the top point of the lower white star extending into the white field above it. = Other symbols = Red carnation The Fraternity Hymn was written by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. when he was a prospective member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, \\"We know that you play [piano] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there and come up with a hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn.\\" Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words‚Äîfor example, \\"Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below\\" became \\"K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below.\\" The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.  Membership  A member of a college or university band who has completed one term in such a band may be offered membership in the fraternity. First-term freshmen may only join if an exception is made by that chapter's sponsor or director of bands. There were almost 6,000 members active across the country in 2011, and more than 66,000 have joined the organization since 1919. A member of Kappa Kappa Psi may not be initiated as an active member of Tau Beta Sigma and vice versa‚Äîif a member of Kappa Kappa Psi transfers to a school with a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma and no Kappa Kappa Psi, he or she may instead join the sorority chapter as an \\"associate member\\" after going through a short orientation process acclimating the member to the sorority. Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi are not restricted from joining Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia or Sigma Alpha Iota, except by the gender restrictions or other eligibility requirements of either organization. Joint statements between Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia have affirmed this since at least 1973, and have been reaffirmed as recently as 2005, when the organizations released a joint statement saying, \\"there are equally important roles for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Alpha Iota, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma to fulfill on any campus where our chapters mutually exist, now or in the future. Each organization possesses a distinct mission and, as a result, fulfills a unique and vital role in the musical environment of a college campus.\\" Indeed, founder Raymond Shannon went on to join Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia after starting Kappa Kappa Psi. = Chapters and districts = District map of Kappa Kappa Psi By 2011 there were 210 active chapters out of 314 chapters chartered since 1919, and 7 colonies. Colonies are probationary chapters at universities that have not historically had a chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi or whose chapter has gone inactive. Chapters and colonies of Kappa Kappa Psi are organized into seven districts, six of which are named for the geographical region of the United States that they represent. These are the North Central, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western Districts. Although an International District is provided for, it has no chapters. = National conventions = Every two years in odd-numbered years, Kappa Kappa Psi holds a national convention. The first such convention was held in 1922 in Stillwater, and only three conventions since then have not been held: 1931, and the 1943 and 1945 conventions which were canceled due to World War II. The assembly of chapters in these conventions is called the National Chapter, which is the governing body of the fraternity and has the power to elect members of the National Council and Board of Trustees. The location of the National Convention rotates among the districts. = National Presidents of Kappa Kappa Psi = A. Frank Martin, first Grand President, 1920 * A. Frank Martin, 1919‚Äì1922 * Scott P.

They are designed to meet the requirements unique to each department. The maneuverability of these vehicles on crowded sidewalks and their ability to navigate narrow, crowded driveways offer advantages over cars, although a bicycle's top speed is lower. Bicycle patrols are more common in temperate urban areas where limited coverage areas are available. The use of bicycles instead of cars can make police officers more easily approachable, especially in low-crime areas. Bicycles can also be issued to police officers to enhance the mobility and range of foot patrols. Bicycles are also effective crime- fighting tools when used in densely populated urban areas. The bikes are nearly silent in operation and many criminals do not realize that an approaching person on a bike is actually a police officer. Furthermore, if the criminal attempts to flee on foot, the riding police officer has a speed advantage while able to quickly dismount if necessary. In the average hour, a patrol car would have 3.3 contacts with the public, while bicycle patrols had 7.3 contacts with the public. The average number of people in contact with the police per hour was 10.5 for motor patrols and 22.8 for bicycle patrols. This information tells us simply that the activity level of police officers on bicycles is higher than that of the officers in cars. History Bicycle- mounted NYPD officer in the 1890s Police officers began bicycling late in the 19th century, with the first department adopting boneshakers in 1869 in Illinois. British officers began using tricycles by the 1880s, around the same time Boston, MA was patrolled by penny-farthings. Newark, NJ had established a bicycle squad in 1888. With the advent of the safety bicycle and the bike boom of the 1890s, police bicycles came into widespread use in North American cities. Bicycles began to see greater adoption by rural departments around the same time. The Kent police purchased 20 bicycles in 1896, and there were 129 rural police bicycle patrols were operating by 1904 . Some countries retained the police bicycle while others replaced them with motor vehicles. In the 21st century there has been renewed interest in police bicycles, since they provide greater accessibility to bicycle and pedestrian zones and allow access when roads are congested. Bicycle characteristics British police officers on custom Smith & Wesson bicycles The bicycles are custom designed for law enforcement use. Many manufacturers of bicycles offer police models, including Haro, Volcanic, Trek, Cannondale, Fuji, Safariland-Kona, Force, and KHS. Other companies offer police, fire and EMS specific models. Many are equipped with a rear rack and bag to hold equipment. Police bicycles' pedals are almost always flat pedals, sometimes outfitted with toe clips/straps, to allow for normal shoes to be worn (versus cycling-specific shoes that clip into \\"clipless\\" pedals), allowing officers to chase on foot if necessary. They are equipped with front and rear lighting systems, with a water bottle battery. The lights can be LED, or halogen, or sometimes Xenon strobes. A headlight(s) are on the front, along with red or blue flashing lights. In the UK emergency service bicycles were allowed blue flashing lights from 21 October 2005. A red light is often attached to the rear of the bike. Tires are usually semi-slick designs with smooth centers for street riding and mild tread or knobs on the outer edges to provide some traction if the bikes are ridden off a paved surface. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has investigated the potential health effects of prolonged bicycling in police bicycle patrol units, including the possibility that some bicycle saddles exert excessive pressure on the urogenital area of cyclists, restricting blood flow to the genitals. NIOSH recommends that riders use a no- nose bicycle seat for workplace bicycling. In contrast, cycling expert Grant Petersen asserts that most modern saddles are designed to avoid excessive pressure on the urogenital area and that noseless saddles result in diminished bicycle handling capabilities. Hoover Dam Police Officer on bike patrol. Specialized training for modern bicycle officers is provided by companies and professional organizations. American Bike Patrol Services is one of the first training organizations serving law enforcement in conjunction with Californias academies training programs since 1991. The Law Enforcement Bicycling Association (LEBA) was founded by members of the first police mountain bike patrol in the U.S. and began training colleagues from across North America in the early 1990s. With roots in John Forester's Effective Cycling and the League of American Bicyclists, the International Police Mountain Bike Association provides training courses for officers and hosts an annual professional conference called Police On Bikes. Common training topics include nutrition, clothing and protective equipment, bike maintenance and repair, prevention of accidents and common injuries, slow speed balance and handling, technical maneuvers, night operations, bike and patrol equipment, firearms training, patrol tactics, and unit-level formations and crowd control techniques.

He pitched all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball from 1985‚Äì89. He is one of the players dealt by the New York Mets to the Montreal Expos for Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter. CareerNew York Mets= Youmans was born in Tampa, Florida, and was a childhood friend and Hillsborough High School teammate of former Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden before moving with his family to Fontana, California. He was drafted by the Mets in the second round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft, one round after the club selected Gooden. He and Gooden were teammates on the Kingsport Mets in 1982. With the South Atlantic League's Columbia Mets in 1983, Youmans went 12-3 with a 3.42 earned run average. After splitting the 1984 season between the Lynchburg and Jackson Mets, Youmans was traded on December 10, to the Montreal Expos along with Hubie Brooks, Mike Fitzgerald and Herm Winningham for future Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter. =Montreal Expos= Youmans made his major league debut in the middle of the following season, starting on July 1, 1985, against the St. Louis Cardinals. For the season, Youmans went 4-3 with a team best 2.45 ERA. One of those wins came on the second to last day of the season against Ron Darling and the New York Mets in front of 45,404 at Shea Stadium. On June 18, 1986, Youmans bested Gooden the first time the two faced off against each other, holding the Mets to only one earned run in 5.1 innings, and drawing a walk in his first at bat against Gooden. However, they would face off again on August 1, and this time Gooden would emerge victorious. In the hard-throwing right-hander's first full season as a member of the rotation full-time, Youmans threw five double-digit strikeout games and finishing third in the National League with 202 strikeouts. He also led the league with 118 bases on balls, however, limiting his effectiveness and contributing to a 13-12 win-loss record. Youmans' 1987 season was plagued with injuries, as he visited the disabled list three times. However, he still managed to make 23 starts for the Expos, and went 4-1 with a 1.13 ERA and three shutouts in the month of July to earn National League Pitcher of the Month honors. Drug rehab After the 1987 season, Youmans checked into an alcohol rehabilitation center under speculation that he had been forced to do so by Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Youmans was 3-6 with a 3.21 ERA when his 1988 season was cut short on June 25 by an indefinite suspension for \\"failing to comply with his drug-testing program.\\" On August 10, the suspension was reduced to sixty days, and the following day, Youmans admitted during a news conference to having used cocaine. =Philadelphia Phillies= On December 6, 1988, Youmans was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies with Jeff Parrett for Kevin Gross. His 1989 season was marked by injuries, as he was on the disabled list for most of May and pitched his last game on June 24, ending the season with a 1-5 record and 5.70 ERA. He had arthroscopic shoulder surgery on August 22, and never pitched at the major league level again. =Comeback attempts= Youmans pitched for the independent Sullivan Mountain Lions and Newburgh Night Hawks of the Northeast League in 1995, and became a coach for the Catskill Cougars the following season. He became interim manager of the club during the 1997 season when Edgar Perez was fired as manager on August 4. He again attempted a comeback in 2003 at age 39 with the Canadian Baseball League's Saskatoon Legends, but only pitched five games before the league folded. In 2008 and 2009, Youmans was the pitching coach for the Joliet Jackhammers of the Northern League.

They may be custom designed to meet the requirements unique of a particular use. A police motorcycle is often called a \\"motor\\" by police officers in the United States. Similarly, motorcycle units are known as \\"motor units\\" and motorcycle officers are known as motor officers. The maneuverability of the motorcycle on crowded streets offer advantages not provided by larger, more traditional police vehicles. The motorcycle's relatively small size allows it to get to accident scenes more quickly when incidents such as traffic collisions slow down access by four-wheel vehicles. Police motorcycles are also used in police funerals, VIP motorcades, and other special events.  History  Muskegon, Michigan police in 1920 Police officers have used motorcycles--primarily for the enforcement of traffic laws and as escort vehicles--since the early 20th century. Chief August Vollmer of the Berkeley Police Department is credited with organizing the first official police motorcycle patrol in the United States in 1911. However, several police forces around the country reported using motorcycles as patrol vehicles earlier. Harley-Davidson credits Detroit, Michigan as being the first purchaser of police motorcycles in 1908. The police department in Evanston, Illinois also purchased a belt-driven motorcycle for its first motorcycle police officer in 1908, and the Portland, Oregon Police Bureau had a police officer who used his personal motorcycle to patrol the city as early as 1909. The role of the motorcycle as inexpensive public transportation evolved in the 1930s, and their use by police and the armed forces also grew, providing a stable production market for the more utilitarian machines, especially as Europe rearmed after World War I.  Motorcycles used  BSA motorcycles in the mid 20th century police departments in the United States typically use purpose-built motorcycles marketed by Harley-Davidson, Kawasaki, or BMW Motorrad. Kawasaki police motorcycles, which were built for the US market in Lincoln, Nebraska, ceased production in September 2005. However, the Kawasaki Concours 14 is being modified and marketed for police use in some markets. In Germany, BMW Motorrad is the largest provider of motorcycles for authority use. In the United Kingdom, the most common police motorcycles are the BMW R1200RT-P and the Yamaha FJR1300. UK police forces have withdrawn the Honda ST1300 Pan-European since the death of an officer was blamed on the machine. Some police forces also use scooters within towns for parking enforcement, or special-purpose machines such as unmarked (covert), or off-road motorcycles. Fleet of British police motorcycles Of the British manufacturers themselves, Triumph motorcycles, built at Meriden, were used by many British (including the Metropolitan Police) and Commonwealth police forces until 1983 when the factory closed. From the late 1940s, Triumph was also, for a time, the choice of the Parisian police, a fact promoted in a factory-produced movie, It's A Triumph !. The police version of the 650cc 6T Triumph Thunderbird was nicknamed the SAINT, an acronym of \\"Stops Anything In No Time\\". By the mid-1970s, with industrial problems and closures affecting their spares supply and service, Triumphs and other British marques were increasingly replaced by the smoother BMW R80 (and to a more limited extent, Norton Interpols) than by then-current Triumph police bikes.A Million Miles Ago by Neale Shilton (Haynes Foulis 1982) In an attempt to win back orders from BMW, Meriden marketed Triumph Bonneville and Tiger models of 750cc size with anti-vibration mountings as well as electric starting but these still only achieved limited sales success. In 1981, the UK newspaper, Motor Cycle News, reported Derbyshire's Chief Constable comparing these Triumphs very unfavorably to BMW, in particular, its anti-vibration engine mounts. Supported by an article in rival publication, Motor Cycle Weekly,Currie, Bob Bonnie Beats The Rap ! Motor Cycle Weekly 6 Feb 1982 this criticism was strongly refuted by the factory and Derbyshire eventually accepted evaluation of police versions of the new Triumph T140W TSS in anti-vibration mounts.Rosamond, John Save The Triumph Bonneville ! The Inside Story of the Meriden Workers' Co-Op (Veloce 2009) Norton's Commando Interpol and later Wankel rotary engine Interpol 2 motorcycle were used by some British forces until that firm's collapse in the early 1990s. Other marques such as BSA were used by some forces although only the Velocette LE 'noddy-bike' model proved as popular with the police as the Triumphs. Hong Kong Police Traffic Unit motorcycle In 2008, BMW claimed to be the largest seller of motorcycles for authority use, as more than 100,000 BMW motorcycles were in official use in over 150 countries on five continents. In 2007, BMW sold 4,284 police motorcycles worldwide. BMW produces factory built police-specific models such as the R1200RT-P and R900RT-P. More than 225 U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the California Highway Patrol, have BMW authority motorcycles in their fleets of patrol vehicles. The new BMW bikes outperformed the aging Harley-Davidson fleet. Harley-Davidson has maintained a long relationship with police departments and law-enforcement agencies in some countries. For the 2009 model year, Harley-Davidson offers the Harley-Davidson FLHTP Electra Glide, the FLHP Road King, the XL883 Sportster and the new XB12XP Buell Ulysses Police motorcycle. The FLHTP Electra Glide and the FLHP Road King are also offered as Fire/Rescue motorcycles. The LAPD drew nationwide attention in June 2014 when they added the Zero Motorcycles MMX stealth electric motorcycle to its fleet. The motorcycle was praised over the traditional bulky Harley-Davidson and BMW bikes for its stealth, low operational costs, immediate tactical advantage, and green environmental impact.

He played in parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1951 and 1954, and later served in the organization for almost four decades. Yochim batted and threw left-handed. Yochim was born and died in New Orleans, Louisiana. Highly touted by the Pittsburgh Pirates during his career, he was a screwball specialist and had a good curve as well, but a sore arm limited him to pitch in only 28.1 innings. He pitched in two games in 1951 and ten in 1954, ending his major league career with a 1-2 record and a 7.62 ERA in 12 games (three as a starter). His professional career highlight came on December 8, 1955, when he became the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League for the Leones del Caracas club. Helped by catcher Earl Battey, Yochim accomplished the feat in the Caracas 3‚Äì0 victory over the Navegantes del Magallanes. Ram√≥n Monzant was credited with the loss. Besides, he also played in the league for Vargas, Gavilanes and Magallanes, compiling a 29-20 record and a 3.57 ERA in 86 games from 1952 through 1956, while pitching for Caracas in the 1953 Caribbean Series.Venezuelan Professional Baseball League batting and pitching statistics Following his playing career, Yochim rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 1966 to become a member of their baseball operations department. He served as an area scout, national crosschecker and major-league scout for the Pirates before moving into the front office in 1994. Yochim also worked as a senior adviser for player personnel from 1994 through 2004, when he decided not to return for another season. He was the older brother of former MLB pitcher and minor league manager and coach Ray Yochim ( 1922-2002).

HistoryEarly (1995‚Äì1997)= During the early to mid-1990s, Saul Freeman had been the instrument-playing half of the London pop duo Thieves (alongside singer David McAlmont). By the time of their second single, \\"Unworthy\\", Thieves were gaining a considerable amount of critical attention and had begun recording a debut album for the Virgin Records imprint Hut Recordings. However, Freeman and McAlmont fell out seriously towards the end of the album sessions. Consequently, Thieves split up, with the album eventually being released in 1994 under McAlmont's name (although Freeman was fully credited for his songwriting and instrumental work). While recovering from the Thieves debacle, Freeman immersed himself in club culture and increased his interest in dance music. In 1995, he and his publishers (Chrysalis Music) put a classified advertisement in Melody Maker in order to find a vocalist for a new project. The advertisement was answered by Nicola Hitchcock, an established musician, singer-songwriter, who had already released a solo album (A Bowl of Chalk) on F-Beat Records a few years previously. Inspired by the developing trip-hop music scene (spearheaded by Massive Attack and Portishead) she began looking for a producer/musician to form a collaborative project. Naming themselves Mandalay, the duo began to write and circulate demo tapes, displaying emergent songs which blended Hitchcock's emotional honesty and melodic sensibilities with Freeman's textured arrangements (which featured elements of trip-hop, dance smoothness and post-punk avant-garde textures). =Empathy and \\"Beautiful\\" (1997‚Äì1999)= Mandalay made their debut on a compilation with an early version of their song \\"This Life\\". They were courted by various major labels on the strength of their first demos, but opted instead to sign to David Steele‚Äôs independent label Organic Records in 1996. Their first single release, \\"Flowers Bloom\\" gained the Single of the Week award in Melody Maker, immediately strengthening their position and leading to a full recording deal with the recently established V2 Music. While Freeman had produced the early recordings, the V2 deal paired Mandalay with producer Guy Sigsworth (ex-Bj√∂rk, Seal, Acacia) for the recording of their debut album. The first Mandalay release on V2 was a re- recorded single version of \\"This Life\\", released in 1997. This was followed in 1998 by a re-recorded \\"Flowers Bloom\\", which trailed the release of the debut album Empathy (featuring appearances by Sigsworth, former Japan and Rain Tree Crow member Steve Jansen, double bassist Danny Thompson and trumpet player Jon Hassell). The album came to the attention of Madonna, who became a big fan and declared Mandalay to be one of her favorite bands. She chose \\"This Life\\" to be featured on the soundtrack for her film, The Next Best Thing, and the track would also appear on the soundtrack to the British film This Year's Love. Many other Mandalay songs have been featured on TV series' including La Femme Nikita, Six Feet Under, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and CSI: Miami. The third single from Empathy - \\"Beautiful\\" - appeared on a number of chillout albums of the time including Cafe del Mar (Vol 6) and Hed Kandi's Serve Chilled. As a result, Mandalay were invited to headline at the Caf√© del Mar 20th anniversary celebrations in Ibiza in 2000. A sunset remix of \\"Beautiful\\" was recorded and mixed by Lenny Ibizarre, the leading chillout DJ/musician on the island. The song went on to be used in a major advertising campaign by Estee Lauder and was chosen for the title track of German film The Polar Bear. In 2003 \\"Beautiful\\" was covered by Sarah Brightman on her hit album Harem. =Instinct and Solace (2000-2001)= Mandalay's second album Instinct was released in 2000 and co-produced with Andy Bradfield (Everything but the Girl, Future Sound of London, Bj√∂rk) and Yoad Nevo (Jem). MK from The Guardian states, \\"Instinct draws inspiration from jazz and classical music to create resolutely elegant, affecting pop .... lush and expansive, Instinct's musical world is perfectly realised.\\" The first single from this album, \\"Deep Love\\", was remixed by Nitin Sawhney - Mandalay went on to support Sawhney on his UK/London dates. Performances at Ibiza's chillout festivals followed including \\"Las Dallias\\" and \\"Dreamdaze\\" culminating in a headline performance at The Big Chill festival in the UK. In order to consolidate their position in the United States (where they were known mostly by hearsay and association), Mandalay released an America-only compilation album called Solace in 2001 which is also considered to be their debut album for the US. This comprised a mix of tracks from Empathy and Instinct (both previously unavailable in the US) and was packaged with an 11 track remix album with contributions from Wagon Christ, Alex Reece and Charlie May. Solace sold more than 44,000 copies in the US, and the band made a brief tour to promote it. =Split and current projects (2002-present)= Although the band was on the brink of an American breakthrough, Mandalay ended in 2002 when Hitchcock and Freeman parted ways shortly after the release of Solace, due to irreconcilable personal and professional differences. Hitchcock went on to release her album Passive Aggressive in 2005 which includes collaborations with artists Ryuichi Sakamoto, Hector Zazou and Chris Brann. She is currently working on a new solo album. Freeman went on to compose music for a number of short films, the full- length art movie Far from China by director C.S. Leigh and a number of UK and US TV programmes including the award-winning documentary series Testing God. In 2013, Freeman started releasing music again after a long period of creative silence.

He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball from to . Williams began his major league career with the Cincinnati Reds before spending the majority of his playing days with the St. Louis Browns, and ended his career playing for the Boston Red Sox. He batted left- handed and threw right-handed. In , Williams became the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. Professional baseball career Williams began his professional baseball career in at the age of 23, playing for the Regina Red Sox of the Western Canada League. In , he played for the Edmonton Eskimos before moving to the Spokane Indians in . After posting a .340 batting average in 79 games for the Indians, he made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on July 14, 1915. He hit for a .242 average in 71 games for the Reds during the peak of the dead-ball era when only 6 players in the league hit above the .300 mark. He played in only 10 games for the Reds in 1916, spending most of the season with Spokane and with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. Williams hit 24 home runs along with a .313 batting average for Portland in before being purchased by the St. Louis Browns. Williams was drafted into the United States Army in April 1918, and appeared in only two games for the Browns that season. He returned to the Browns in 1919 and hit .300 with 6 home runs in 65 games. In , Major League Baseball outlawed specialty pitches such as the spitball and experienced a subsequent jump in the league batting averages as well as home runs. In Williams' first full season as a regular player in 1920, he posted a .307 batting average along with 10 home runs and 72 runs batted in. He continued to improve in 1921 with a .347 batting average with 24 home runs, 117 runs batted in and a career-high .429 on-base percentage. Williams had the best season of his career in 1922, leading the American League with 39 home runs and 155 runs batted in, as the Browns finished the season one game behind the pennant-winning New York Yankees. 32 of his 39 home runs were hit at home in Sportsman's Park. On August 7, 1922, during a game against the Washington Senators, he became the first player in American League history to hit two home runs in one inning. His 39 home runs topped Babe Ruth, who had led the league the previous four seasons, although Ruth had been suspended well into the 1922 season by Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for violating a curb on barnstorming. Williams was one of only two players to break Babe Ruth's twelve-year string in which he led the American League in home runs (the other being Bob Meusel). Also in 1922, Williams also became the first player in major league history to have 30 home runs and 30-plus stolen bases in the same season; a feat which would not be achieved again until Willie Mays accomplished it with the New York Giants in . In August 1923, the Washington Senators came into possession of one of Williams' bats and discovered that it had been bored out and plugged with a lighter wood. The bat was turned over to National League umpire George Hildebrand for investigation and the Senators protested all the victories by the Browns in which Williams had used the bat. Williams explained that he had ordered the bat specially made, but when he received it, he found it to be too heavy, so he plugged it with a lighter wood. He was cited in the 1924 Reach Guide for using a corked bat, although major league baseball hadn't ruled plugged bats illegal at the time. He finished the 1923 season with a career- high .357 batting average along with 29 home runs and 91 runs batted in and ended the season 15th in Most Valuable Player Award balloting. In November 1924, it was rumored that the Yankees were trying to trade for Williams, which would have teamed him with Ruth to make one of the most powerful home run combinations in baseball. However, St. Louis manager George Sisler's insistence on the Yankees trading Waite Hoyt for Williams was too high a price for Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert. Williams had another productive season in 1925, hitting .331 with 25 home runs and 105 runs batted in, and led the league with a .613 slugging percentage. Williams continued to hit well for the remainder of his career with St. Louis until December 15, 1927, when he was purchased by the Boston Red Sox for $10,000. He played two more seasons for the Red Sox, hitting for a .345 average in 1929 at the age of 39. Williams returned to the minor leagues in to play two more seasons for the Portland Beavers before retiring in at the age of 41. Career statistics In a fourteen-year major league career, Williams played in 1,397 games, accumulating 1,552 hits in 4,862 at bats for a .319 career batting average along with 196 home runs, 916 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .393. Of his 196 home runs, 142 came at his home park. He retired with a .958 fielding percentage. As baseball evolved out of the dead-ball era, Williams finished in the top four in the American League in home runs in seven consecutive seasons (1921‚Äì1927). He posted ten seasons with a batting average above .300, and three seasons in which he scored more than 100 runs. As of , Williams' .319 career batting average ranked 53rd all-time in major league history. His .924 career on-base plus slugging percentage and his .530 career slugging percentage, ranked 45th and 48th respectively all-time among major league players. Williams holds the St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles single season record for runs batted in with 155 in . He is the St. Louis Browns' all-time leader in on-base percentage (.403), slugging percentage (.558) and OPS (.961). In the 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Williams as the 50th greatest left fielder of all-time. Post-baseball Williams returned to Grants Pass and worked as a police officer before becoming owner and operator of the Owl Club, a restaurant and billiard parlor on G Street.Grants Pass Daily Courier, Downtown Tidbits, September 11, 2008Josephine County Historical Society, Looking Back: Ken Williams, Young at Heart magazine, February 2012, page 10 See also * List of Major League Baseball career batting average leaders * List of Major League Baseball career on-base percentage leaders * List of Major League Baseball career slugging percentage leaders * List of Major League Baseball career OPS leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders ReferencesExternal links * Category:1890 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:American League home run champions Category:American League RBI champions Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Edmonton Eskimos (baseball) players Category:Spokane Indians players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Baseball players from Oregon Category:Sportspeople from Grants Pass, Oregon ","title":"Ken Williams (baseball)"},{"id":"2732678","text":"Charles Bird (born 9 September 1949)In his semi-autobiography This Is Charlie Bird, he states he has two birth certificates, one saying he was born 4 September 1949, the other 9 September 1949.

On June 1, 1954, he was traded by the Baltimore Orioles to the Cleveland Indians for Bob Chakales. When he was traded he was hitting only .202 with one home run after 29 games. He immediately became the starting first baseman for the Indians replacing Bill Glynn (baseball) who held down the position the previous year.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wertzvi01.shtml In the 1954 World Series, Wertz hit a long fly ball that Willie Mays caught, known as \\"The Catch\\". It went over to dead center of the Polo Grounds in New York, and a sportswriter said, \\"It would have been a home run in any other park, including Yellowstone.\\"http://www.bigvisionfoundation.org/wertz After he retired from playing, Wertz kept a photo of ‚ÄúThe Catch‚Äù in his office at his beer distribution company and explained he had no negative feelings about being remembered for hitting a deep fly out. \\"I'm very proud that I'm associated with it,\\" Wertz told UPI in 1979. \\"I look at it this way: If that ball Willie caught had been a home run or a triple, how many people would've remembered me? Not many. This way, everybody who meets me for the first time always identifies me with Willie's catch, and that makes me feel good.\\" http://www.bigvisionfoundation.org/wertz Vic Wertz Field at the Berks County Youth Recreation Facility in Pennsylvania is named in his honor. The field was dedicated on April 19, 2013.http://www.bigvisionfoundation.org/wertz Personal life Wertz was a World War II veteran. During and after his baseball career, Wertz worked in the Detroit area beer distribution business . When he retired to Mount Clemens, Michigan, he formed \\"Wertz Warriors\\", a group of sportsmen who raised funds for the Special Olympics Winter Games. He was the founder of an 800-mile snowmobile endurance ride, run annually in Michigan starting in 1982 to benefit the Special Olympics. Wertz died during heart surgery at Detroit's Harper Hospital on the morning of July 7, 1983. Surgeons were performing a coronary bypass and replacing a valve in his heart after he had suffered a heart attack the previous day. He is buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

He played for the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies in the National League and for the Baltimore Orioles of the American League. He was elected to the National League All-Star team twice (1948 and 1949). Early career Waitkus, the son of Lithuanian immigrants, grew up in Boston and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Boston College. He began his professional career in 1938 playing for the Worumbo Indians, a semi- professional team sponsored by Worumbo Woolen Mill in Lisbon Falls, Maine. As a rookie, he was known as \\"the natural,\\" which gave the title to the book loosely based on his life. He saw some of the bloodier fighting of World War II with the U.S. Army in the Philippines, and was awarded four Bronze Stars. Upon his return to baseball he quickly became a star for the Chicago Cubs. He also became a popular media figure, as he was well-educated and was fluent in Lithuanian, Polish, German, and French. Following the 1948 season, the Cubs traded Waitkus with Hank Borowy to the Philadelphia Phillies for Monk Dubiel and Dutch Leonard. Shooting Just a few years into the start of what seemed a very promising career, Ruth Ann Steinhagen, an obsessed fan, shot Waitkus at Chicago's Edgewater Beach Hotel on June 14, 1949, in one of the earliest recognized cases of criminal stalking. Steinhagen had become infatuated with him when he was a Cub, but seeing him every day in-season may have kept her obsession in check. Once he was traded to the Phillies, Steinhagen's obsession grew to dangerous proportions. She checked into the hotel using the alias of a former high school classmate of his and left a note at the desk, asking him to come to her hotel room on an urgent matter. When he arrived in her room, she shot him with a .22 caliber rifle, the bullet barely missing his heart. She immediately called the desk to report the shooting and was found cradling his head in her lap. Waitkus was taken to the Illinois Masonic Hospital,Associated Press, ‚ÄúEddie Waitkus, Major League Player, Shot,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 15 June 1949, Volume LV, Number 247, page 1. where he nearly died several times on the operating table before the bullet was successfully removed. Steinhagen never stood trial but instead was briefly confined to a mental institution. Return to action After being shot in Chicago, Waitkus did not play again in the 1949 season, in which he compiled a .306 batting average with 27 RBI and 41 runs scored in 54 games played. However Waitkus did return in uniform, although not to action, on August 19, 1949 for \\"Eddie Waitkus Night\\" at Shibe Park, at which he was feted by the Phillies and showered with gifts. Waitkus returned to play in the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies season as the leadoff hitter for the Whiz Kids team that won the 1950 National League pennant. Waitkus led the team in scoring with 102 runs.https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1950.shtml Waitkus made his only post-season appearance in the 1950 World Series. After the 1950 season, Waitkus was named the Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year. Later life Prior to the 1954 season, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Waitkus from the Philadelphia Phillies for $40,000 (). Released by the Orioles in 1955, he returned to the PhilliesPhillies sign Eddie Waitkus for the remainder of the season. After the 1955 baseball season was complete, the Phillies released Waitkus.Phillies release Waitkus, Lowrey; Sell Bob Kuzava Waitkus taught at Ted Williams' baseball camp before dying of esophageal cancer at age 53.Munich tragedy has happened before The Natural Author Bernard Malamud may have woven the basic elements of the Waitkus story ‚Äî including that some called Waitkus \\"The Natural\\" because of his natural swing ‚Äî and other baseball legends (notably that of Joe Jackson) into The Natural. The book was published in 1952 and was made into a Hollywood film starring Robert Redford and Glenn Close released in 1984. However, it is unclear if Malamud was solely inspired by the shooting of Waitkus, or if he instead or also had borrowed from the life of Cubs shortstop Billy Jurges, who was shot by his ex-girlfriend in 1932 at the Chicago hotel in which they lived.

Charles sought to secure the large arsenal held in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. He first approached the town in late April 1642, but was rebuffed by the town's Parliamentarian governor, Sir John Hotham. Charles retreated to York, but in July he received news that Hotham might be willing to hand over the town if the Royalists approached with a large enough force that Hotham could surrender with his honour intact. Charles marched towards the town with an army of 4,000 men. In the meantime, Hull had been reinforced by sea, and Parliament had sent Sir John Meldrum to command the town's garrison, as they were concerned about Hotham's loyalty. Hotham once again rejected the King's demands to enter the town, and a largely ineffective siege was established by the Royalists, commanded by the Earl of Lindsey as the King had returned to York. Meldrum led a series of successful sallies from the town, and after a particularly effective one on 27 July, which destroyed a Royalist magazine to the west of the town, Lindsey lifted the siege and withdrew the King's forces to York. Background In 1642, disagreements between the English Parliament and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing for over half a century. At the beginning of January that year, King Charles unsuccessfully attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament (MPs) who were opposing him. Having failed, and realising that Parliament had more support in London than he did, Charles fled the capital, and both sides began preparing for war. =Hull= In the 17th century, Kingston upon Hull, or Hull, was the second largest town in Yorkshire; with a population of 7,000, only the northern capital of York was bigger. Access to the North Sea meant it was the primary export point for manufactured goods produced in Northern England; while its position at the confluence of the Hull and Humber rivers also made it the centre of an inland trade route.Hull's Maritime History. In his military history of Yorkshire, David Cooke called it \\"a very important town\\", while the Victoria County History described it as \\"strategically important\\". Its arms magazine in Lowgate was the second largest in England after the Tower of London; in 1642, it contained 120 artillery pieces, 7,000 barrels of powder, and weapons for 16,000 to 20,000 men. The town's position made it naturally very defensible. It had been fortified in the fourteenth century, and these defences were enhanced over time. By the 1630s, Hull was completely enclosed by walls; on the west bank of the River Hull, on which the town itself sat, medieval walls fronted by a ditch and interspersed with 25 towers were located on all but the river-side of the town. On the east bank, a curtain wall featuring three blockhouses had been erected during the reign of Henry VIII (). In preparation for the Bishops' Wars, further improvements were made to the defences: the ditch was cleaned out, and an additional ditch dug. Between the two ditches batteries were installed near the gates, and breastworks connected them to create a new outer perimeter. Drawbridges were installed at both Beverley Gate and North Gate, and the town was supplied with additional artillery. Sluice gates were also placed on the two rivers to enable the garrison to flood low- lying land surrounding the town. The historian Andrew Hopper described Hull as being \\"arguably the strongest fortress town in England.\\" Unlike most of Yorkshire, which had a mix of MPs favouring Parliament or the King, Hull and the surrounding East Riding of Yorkshire had returned exclusively Parliament- favouring members. The area was also religiously opposed to the King, having a strong Puritan population. Within Hull itself, MPs were typically chosen for their willingness to stand-up for the town, rather than any underlying political or religious beliefs, as the town's corporation was interested in maintaining its own interests in the town without external influence. =Sir John Hotham= Sir John Hotham Sir John Hotham fought in the Palatinate campaign of the Thirty Years' War in the early part of the seventeenth century, before later being returned as a member of Parliament for Beverley in the East Riding. He was a favourite of Thomas Wentworth, who appointed him as governor of Hull in 1628. Hotham opposed both the King and Wentworth during the Bishops' Wars, and was replaced as governor in 1639. The following year he withheld reinforcements from Wentworth, for which he was stripped of more of his positions. Hotham was renowned for being easily offended, and was described by Sir Hugh Cholmeley as often letting his emotions overcome his better judgement. He felt slighted by the loss of his commissions, and turned into a political opponent of the King in Parliament, where he became one of the most vocal members. Prelude Due to the large arsenal in Hull, both sides were eager to gain control of the city. On 11 January, Charles appointed the Earl of Newcastle as the governor of Hull and commanded him to take and hold the town for the Royalist cause. Around the same time, Hotham was given the same position and orders by Parliament. Newcastle arrived at Hull on 15 January with letters from the King offering pardons to the townspeople and ordering them to allow him access to the magazine. Wary of the reception he might receive, he initially attempted to gain entry under the pseudonym of \\"Sir John Savage\\", but was recognised and forced to reveal his true identity. Lacking military might or local influence, Newcastle was unable to gain entry, and sent a message to the King saying \\"the town will not admit me by any means, so I am very flat and out of countenance here.\\" Hotham's son, Captain John Hotham, an MP for Scarborough, arrived outside Hull three days later, backed by around 300 of his father's militia. Captain Hotham was also refused entry to the town, but after threatening to report them to Parliament, he spread rumours that local Catholics and the Spanish were planning to attack the town, and was finally allowed entry under emergency terms. Despite the manoeuvrings between the King and Parliament, there remained an illusion that the two sides were still governing the country together. This illusion ended when Charles moved north, fearing that he would be captured if he remained in the south of England. He arrived in York, roughly north-west of Hull, on 18 March. Around the same time, Sir John Hotham arrived in Hull to assume governorship of the town, and was given orders from Parliament \\"not to admit any forces into Hull without orders from both houses of Parliament.\\" The garrison was increased to roughly 1,000 soldiers, but despite this Parliament was wary about the close proximity of the King's forces, and ordered that the town's magazine should be transported to London. =King Charles demands entry= A 19th-century painting, depicting King Charles I demanding entrance to Hull. Eager to capture the magazine before it could be moved to London, Charles rode towards Hull himself. He sent a small retinue ahead, consisting of his eight-year-old son‚Äîthe Duke of York (later King James II of England)‚Äîand his nephew‚Äîthe deposed Elector Palatine Charles Louis‚Äîalong with some members of the nobility and fifty men. The group were admitted into the town on 22 April, and hosted by the town's mayor and aldermen. Charles Louis told the mayor that they planned to meet the King on his way to the town the next day. Accordingly, on the next morning, Sir Lewis Dyve arrived at the gates, and announced that King Charles intended to dine in the town that day. Hotham held a meeting with the town's leaders and they resolved not to allow Charles to enter Hull, and duly secured the town gates and lifted the drawbridges. Charles approached Beverley Gate on the morning of 23 April, accompanied by many local nobles, the Earl of Montrose, the Earl of Lindsey, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and a large army from the local trained bands. The King's heralds announced his arrival, and then demanded that he be allowed entry to the town and the magazine, on the basis that it was property of the Crown. Hotham stood on top of the low wall next to the gate, and announced that despite his loyalty to the King, he could not allow the King and his army to enter the town without breaking the trust placed in him by Parliament. Doing so, he explained, would label him \\"the odious name of villain and faith- breaker.\\" He offered to allow the King entry with a small escort of twelve men, but when the King demanded thirty, Hotham demurred, worried that it could rouse Royalist sympathisers in the town. The two sides continued to dispute matters until the early evening, during which time Hotham agreed to provide food for the King, which he had lowered from the town walls. Frustrated, the King declared Hotham a traitor and suggested that he should be thrown from the walls by the townspeople, but the declaration had no effect, and the Royalists withdrew to Beverley. Parliament responded to the King's charge of treason by stating that Hotham had only been following their orders, and that the King had breached Parliamentary privilege by branding Hotham a traitor. This declaration from Parliament brought Hotham to national attention; as was typical during the civil war, Parliament celebrated its victory over the King by publishing propaganda. A speech made by Hotham on 23 May, in which he justified his actions in defying Charles, was published in pamphlet form, and for a time those that favoured Parliament were known as 'Hothamites'. In response, a picture was published suggesting that Hotham felt he was superior to the King: Parliament ordered the picture to be ceremonially burned. Hotham was worried about the prospect of unrest and rebellion within Hull. At the end of April, Parliament announced that should he be killed his son would replace him as governor. To try and prevent desertions, he spread rumours that the King had ordered any soldiers caught outside the city walls to be killed. By the end of May, in response to demands from Hotham that others \\"share in his dangers and responsibilities\\", Parliament sent Sir William Airmyn, Sir William Strickland, John Alured, Michael Warton, Henry Darley and Peregrine Pelham to Hull with Captain Hotham. During May, Parliament had also transported the majority of the weapons from Hull on four boats; around three-quarters of what had been housed in the town arrived in London on 30 May. Siege After rebuffing the King in April, Hotham had to put down several plots from within Hull to betray the town. In his account of the Civil War, the Earl of Clarendon suggested that Hotham was meanwhile planning to hand the town over to the King himself. Lord Digby had been captured by a Parliamentarian ship, but pretended to be a Frenchman who did not speak English. He was taken to Hull, where he met with Hotham and admitted his true identity. Digby tried to persuade Hotham to surrender Hull to the King. The two agreed that if the King approached the town with a sufficient force, then Hotham could make a show of resisting, before honourably surrendering the town. Digby travelled to York, still disguised as a Frenchman, and informed Charles of the plan. Sir John Meldrum was sent by Parliament to both assist Hotham, and ensure his loyalty.On 3 July, Charles marched from York with 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. On arrival, rather than admitting the King as agreed, Hotham held fast against the King's demands to enter. Hull defences had been further improved, and the poorly trained and equipped army the King had brought was insufficient to storm the town. Charles had contemplated trying to blockade Hull, but had been told by Thomas Glemham, a former governor, that the town was so low-lying that surface water was easily accessible, and Parliament's control of the navy meant that it could be easily replenished by sea. Parliament sent further reinforcements (recorded as between 500 and 1,500) which arrived by sea on 10 July, led by Sir John Meldrum. In addition to supplementing the garrison, Meldrum had been sent by Parliament to command the garrison, as they were growing suspicious of Hotham's loyalty. To make the town more defensible, Hotham ordered the sluice gates be opened, and that the banks of the Humber should be breached to allow the high spring tide to flood the land around the town. He also had buildings beyond the town walls destroyed to remove any cover the King's army could use during an attack; this included the Carthusian hospital building to the north, and the village of Myton to the west. Though Parliament controlled the navy, the Royalists did manage to send one ship up the river Humber as far as Keyingham, east of Hull, where they offloaded eight artillery guns which they then transported across land to establish a battery on the eastern side of the town. Forts were also established in Paull, Hessle and on the southern bank of the Humber, in order to fire at ships using the river. The siege of Hull is variously described as commencing from either 10 July or 15 July, and a sally made by Meldrum is often attributed as the \\"first blood\\" of the First English Civil War. According to John Rushworth, Meldrum attacked the King's forces with 500 men. The Royalist cavalry were not backed up by their infantry, and in the face of the attack retreated towards Beverley. Meldrum's force made chase, killing two and capturing thirty. At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required. Charles, having been frustrated in his efforts to capture the town, withdrew from Hull, leaving the Earl of Lindsey in command of his forces. Another sortie by Meldrum on 27 July attacked the Royalist arsenal in Anlaby, to the west of Hull, capturing fifteen cannons and a mortar. After this loss, the Royalists lifted the siege and retreated to York. Aftermath Less than four weeks after retreating from Hull, on 22 August 1642, Charles I raised his royal standard at Nottingham. He declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the formal start of the First English Civil War. Securing Hull and its arsenal ensured the Parliamentarian army began the war better equipped than their opponents, and is viewed by historian IE Ryder as \\"one of the pivotal actions\\" for the first year of the conflict. In September 1642, Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax signed a non-aggression pact with local Royalists in an attempt to maintain peace in Yorkshire. Hotham disagreed with the move, and after making strong declarations against the pact, he broke it by attacking Selby and Cawood Castle in early October, after which the Royalists retaliated by attacking Fairfax's headquarters in Bradford. Hotham's doubts about defying the King remained: fuelled by his disagreements with Fairfax, Hotham tried to negotiation a defection with the Earl of Newcastle. Captain Hotham was arrested for disloyalty by Oliver Cromwell in June 1643 but managed to escape. Concerned that both father and son were going to defect, Parliament ordered Matthew Boynton to take control of Hull, which he did on 29 June. Hotham escaped to Beverley, where he was captured and taken to London. Both Hothams were sent to the Tower of London as prisoners, tried and sentenced to death. Despite reprieves and a vote in the House of Commons, they were executed at the end of January 1645. During 1642, the Parliamentarians had the upper hand in the East Riding of Yorkshire, but they suffered territorial losses early the following year, and by June they only held a few towns in the area, including Hull. In August, a Royalist army of 16,000 men commanded by the Earl of Newcastle captured Beverley, forcing Sir Thomas Fairfax, the son of Lord Fairfax, to retreat to Hull. The town was besieged for the second time in the war between 2 September and 12 October. Newcastle bombarded Hull from a series of siege forts armed with eighteen artillery guns. Although the town suffered heavy damage from the attacks, it was once again able to be replenished by sea, and in early October Parliamentarian sallies damaged or captured some of the siege forts. Along with a Royalist defeat at the Battle of Winceby, this led Newcastle to lift the siege and retreat to York.

After his playing career ended, Morgan made a successful career in broadcasting, both as a commentator and presenter and also as a programme- maker and BBC executive. Rugby career Morgan, born in Trebanog in the Rhondda valley, was from a mining family and joined Cardiff Rugby Club straight from Tonyrefail Grammar School in 1949, playing at fly-half. Blessed with natural balance and strength, together with an astute line-kicking ability and searing acceleration, he quickly made an impact. He also played club rugby in Ireland for Bective Rangers in the 1955‚Äì56 season, with the club being dubbed the \\"Morgan Rangers\\" as a result. He won his first cap for Wales against Ireland in 1951, playing opposite his own hero Jack Kyle. He was part of the Grand Slam-winning Welsh side of 1952. The following year he inspired both Cardiff and Wales to historic victories over the touring All Blacks. In 1956, following his success on the 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa, he was made captain of Wales. During that tour, in which the Test series was drawn 2‚Äì2, Morgan distinguished himself for his marshalling of a talented Lions backline that included Jeff Butterfield and Arthur Smith in the centre, with Cecil Pedlow and Tony O'Reilly on the wings. Morgan's try in the first Test at Ellis Park, in front of a then world-record crowd of 100,000, helped secure a sensational 23‚Äì22 victory at the end of a match that some still consider the most exciting ever played. The Springboks levelled the series in the second Test. Then, with Lions skipper Robin Thompson injured ahead of the third Test in Pretoria, Morgan was made captain and duly inspired his team and controlled the game to ensure a 9‚Äì6 win that meant the series could not be lost. The South African newspapers dubbed him \\"Morgan the Magnificent\\"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/voices-of-sport-cliff-morgan-the- bbc-presenter-who-produced-a-magical-piece-of-commentary-for-rugbys-greatest- ever-try-230211330.html and the level to which his influence was thought key was reflected in the frenzy of coverage his injured ankle received as the fourth Test came around. Although he played, he was not fully fit and the Lions could not prevent the Springboks squaring the series. But his reputation was already made and the memory of that tour - still known in South Africa as \\"the Cliff Morgan tour\\" - proved long-lived. His last game of first-class rugby was for the Barbarians on 28 May 1958 at the RFUEA Ground, Nairobi, versus East Africa. Broadcasting and television career Following his retirement from the game in 1958 he found a new career in broadcasting. Although he will forever be remembered for his celebrated commentary on the 1973 Barbarians rugby match against the touring All Blacks at Cardiff (particularly the commentary of \\"that try, that golden try\\") his broadcasting career was far more wide-ranging and influential than that single event would suggest. During his playing days he had already been spotted by the BBC in Wales as a natural talker and communicator, and in 1960, at the invitation of the BBC's Head of Welsh Programmes, Hywel Davies, he joined BBC Wales as Sports Organiser in Cardiff. His exceptional ability as a programme-maker and story-teller briefly took him outside the familiar world of BBC Sport in the mid-1960s, when he spent two years as editor of ITV's current affairs programme This Week. Returning to the BBC he then produced and edited established TV sports programmes such as Grandstand and Sportsnight With Coleman, and, from 1970, was himself one of the original team captains (opposite Henry Cooper) on the long-running TV quiz A Question of Sport. In radio he found a natural outlet for his love of music, presenting for a time the BBC Radio 2 series These You Have Loved. Off-air, his enduring influence in the world of sport and beyond helped him rise to join the ranks of leading BBC executives. In 1974 he became Head of BBC Radio Sport and Outside Broadcasts, and from 1976 to 1987 he was Head of BBC Television Sport and Outside Broadcasts, supervising coverage of major events including football World Cups, Commonwealth and Olympic Games, Royal weddings and other national ceremonial occasions, notably the funeral of Mountbatten in 1979 and the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981. After his retirement from his executive post in BBC Television in 1987 he returned to radio, where his warm, mellifluous voice, together with his natural conversational style and his wide range of contacts in sport and entertainment, greatly benefited BBC Radio 4 series such as Sport on Four (1987‚Äì1998), My Heroes (1987‚Äì90) and Down The River. In 1988 he was a subject of ITV's This Is Your Life. He contributed to numerous publications about rugby and lent his voice to many popular rugby videos. Among his books, he edited Rugby The Great Ones (1970), wrote perceptive short profiles to accompany John Ireland's illustrations for the anthology Rugby Characters (1990), and in 1996 produced his autobiography, Cliff Morgan: Beyond the Fields of Play (with Geoffrey Nicholson). Morgan survived a life-threatening stroke in 1972 at the age of 42. He had been commentating on a Rugby match for BFBS in Germany. He spent 3 weeks in RAF Hospital Wegberg and spoke very highly of his treatment there. Cliff Morgan: The Autobiography - Beyond the Fields of Play He made a full recovery. In retirement, he was afflicted with cancer of the vocal chords and the removal of his larynx, resulting in limited ability to speak. Morgan died at his home in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, on 29 August 2013 at the age of 83. Awards When the International Rugby Hall of Fame was created in 1997, Morgan was among the inaugural inductees, alongside his Lions contemporary Tony O'Reilly and Welsh rugby legends Gareth Edwards, Barry John and JPR Williams. In 2009, he was inducted along with O'Reilly into the IRB Hall of Fame, an honour Edwards had received two years earlier. For his contributions to broadcasting, he was honoured with an OBE and a CVO.

Generally speaking, the curriculum drives the use of technology and not vice versa. Technology integration is defined as the use of technology to enhance and support the educational environment. Technology integration in the classroom can also support classroom instruction by creating opportunities for students to complete assignments on the computer rather than with normal pencil and paper. In a larger sense, technology integration can also refer to the use of an integration platform and APIs in the management of a school, to integrate disparate SaaS (Software As A Service) applications, databases, and programs used by an educational institution so that their data can be shared in real- time across all systems on campus, thus supporting students' education by improving data quality and access for faculty and staff. > \\"Curriculum integration with the use of technology involves the infusion of > technology as a tool to enhance the learning in a content area or > multidisciplinary setting... Effective integration of technology is achieved > when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain > information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and > present it professionally to an authentic audience. The technology should > become an integral part of how the classroom functions‚Äîas accessible as all > other classroom tools. The focus in each lesson or unit is the curriculum > outcome, not the technology.\\" Integrating technology with standard curriculum can not only give students a sense of power, but also allows for more advanced learning among broad topics. However, these technologies require infrastructure, continual maintenance and repair ‚Äì one determining element, among many, in how these technologies can be used for curricula purposes and whether or not they will be successful. Examples of the infrastructure required to operate and support technology integration in schools include at the basic level electricity, Internet service providers, routers, modems, and personnel to maintain the network, beyond the initial cost of the hardware and software. Standard education curriculum with an integration of technology can provide tools for advanced learning among a broad range of topics. Integration of information and communication technology is often closely monitored and evaluated due to the current climate of accountability, outcome-based education, and standardization in assessment. Technology integration can in some instances be problematic. A high ratio of students to technological device has been shown to impede or slow learning and task completion. In some, instances dyadic peer interaction centered on integrated technology has proven to develop a more cooperative sense of social relations. Success or failure of technology integration is largely dependent on factors beyond the technology. The availability of appropriate software for the technology being integrated is also problematic in terms of software accessibility to students and educators. Another issue identified with technology integration is the lack of long-range planning for these tools within the educative districts they are being used. Technology is contributes to global development and diversity in classrooms while helping to develop upon the fundamental building blocks needed for students to achieve more complex ideas. In order for technology to make an impact within the educational system, teachers and students must access to technology in a contextual matter that is culturally relevant, responsive and meaningful to their educational practice and that promotes quality teaching and active student learning. History The term 'educational technology' was used during the post World War II era in the United States for the integration of implements such as film strips, slide projectors, language laboratories, audio tapes, and television. Presently, the computers, tablets, and mobile devices integrated into classroom settings for educational purposes are most often referred to as 'current' educational technologies. It is important to note that educational technologies continually change, and once referred to slate chalkboards used by students in early schoolhouses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The phrase 'educational technology', a composite meaning of technology + education, is used to refer to the most advanced technologies that are available for both teaching and learning in a particular era. In 1994 federal legislation for both the Educate America Act and the Improving America's School's Act (IASA) authorized funds for state and federal educational technology planning. One of the principal goals listed in the Educate America Act is to promote the research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities and high levels of educational achievement for all students (Public Law 103-227). In 1996 the Telecommunications Act provided a systematic change necessary to ensure equitable educational opportunities of bringing new technology into the education sector. The Telecomm Act requires affordable access and service to advanced telecom services for public schools and libraries. Many of the computers, tablets, and mobile devices currently used in classrooms operate through Internet connectivity; particularly those that are application based such as tablets. Schools in high-cost areas and disadvantaged schools were to receive higher discounts in telecom services such as Internet, cable, satellite television, and the management component. A chart of \\"Technology Penetration in U.S. Public Schools\\" report states 98% percent of schools reported having computers in the 1995‚Äì1996 school year, with 64% Internet access, and 38% working via networked systems. The ratio of students to computers in the United States in 1984 stood at 15 students per 1 computer, it now stands at an average all-time low of 10 students to computer. From the 1980s on into the 2000s, the most substantial issue to examine in educational technology was school access to technologies according to the 1997 Policy Information Report for Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools. These technologies included computers, multimedia computers, the Internet, networks, cable TV, and satellite technology amongst other technology-based resources. More recently ubiquitous computing devices, such as computers and tablets, are being used as networked collaborative technologies in the classroom. Computers, tablets and mobile devices may be used in educational settings within groups, between people and for collaborative tasks. These devices provide teachers and students access to the World Wide Web in addition to a variety of software applications. Technology education standards National Educational Technology Standards (NETS) served as a roadmap since 1998 for improved teaching and learning by educators. As stated above, these standards are used by teachers, students, and administrators to measure competency and set higher goals to be skillful. The Partnership for 21st Century Skills is a national organization that advocates for 21st century readiness for every student. Their most recent Technology Plan was released in 2010, \\"Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by Technology\\". This plan outlines a vision \\"to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners that mirror students' daily lives and the reality of their futures. In contrast to traditional classroom instruction, this requires that students be put at the center and encouraged to take control of their own learning by providing flexibility on several dimensions.\\" Although tools have changed dramatically since the beginnings of educational technology, this vision of using technology for empowered, self-directed learning has remained consistent. Pedagogy The integration of electronic devices into classrooms has been cited as a possible solution to bridge access for students, to close achievement gaps, that are subject to the digital divide, based on social class, economic inequality, or gender where and a potential user does not have enough cultural capital required to have access to information and communication technologies. Several motivations or arguments have been cited for integrating high-tech hardware and software into school, such as (1) making schools more efficient and productive than they currently are, (2) if this goal is achieved, teaching and learning will be transformed into an engaging and active process connected to real life, and (3) is to prepare the current generation of young people for the future workplace. The computer has access to graphics and other functions students can use to express their creativity. Technology integration does not always have to do with the computer. It can be the use of the overhead projector, student response clickers, etc. Enhancing how the student learns is very important in technology integration. Technology will always help students to learn and explore more. = Paradigms = Most research in technology integration has been criticized for being atheoretical and ad hoc driven more by the affordances of the technology rather than the demands of pedagogy and subject matter. Armstrong (2012) argued that multimedia transmission turns to limit the learning into simple content, because it is difficult to deliver complicated content through multimedia. One approach that attempts to address this concern is a framework aimed at describing the nature of teacher knowledge for successful technology integration. The technological pedagogical content knowledge or TPACK framework has recently received some positive attention. Another model that has been used to analyze tech integration is the SAMR framework, developed by Ruben Puentedura. This model attempts to measure the level of tech integration with 4 the levels that go from Enhancement to Transformation: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition. = Constructivism = Constructivism is a crucial component of technology integration. It is a learning theory that describes the process of students constructing their own knowledge through collaboration and inquiry-based learning. According to this theory, students learn more deeply and retain information longer when they have a say in what and how they will learn. Inquiry-based learning, thus, is researching a question that is personally relevant and purposeful because of its direct correlation to the one investigating the knowledge. As stated by Jean Piaget, constructivist learning is based on four stages of cognitive development. In these stages, children must take an active role in their own learning and produce meaningful works in order to develop a clear understanding. These works are a reflection of the knowledge that has been achieved through active self-guided learning. Students are active leaders in their learning and the learning is student-led rather than teacher‚Äìdirected. Many teachers use a constructivist approach in their classrooms assuming one or more of the following roles: facilitator, collaborator, curriculum developer, team member, community builder, educational leader, or information producer. =Counter argument to computers in the classroom= Is technology in the classroom needed, or does it hinder students' social development? We've all seen a table of teenagers on their phones, all texting, not really socializing or talking to each other. How do they develop social and communication skills? Neil Postman (1993) concludes: > The role of the school is to help students learn how to ignore and discard > information so that they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives; to > help students cultivate a sense of social responsibility; to help students > think critically, historically, and humanely; to help students understand > the ways in which technology shapes their consciousness; to help students > learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the needs of the > group. I could go on for another three pages in this vein without any > reference to how machinery can give students access to information. Instead, > let me summarize in two ways what I mean. First, I'll cite a remark made > repeatedly by my friend Alan Kay, who is sometimes called \\"the father of the > personal computer.\\" Alan likes to remind us that any problems the schools > cannot solve without machines, they cannot solve with them. Second, and with > this I shall come to a close: If a nuclear holocaust should occur some place > in the world, it will not happen because of insufficient information; if > children are starving in Somalia, it's not because of insufficient > information; if crime terrorizes our cities, marriages are breaking up, > mental disorders are increasing, and children are being abused, none of this > happens because of a lack of information. These things happen because we > lack something else. It is the \\"something else\\" that is now the business of > schools.Postman, N. (1993). Of Luddites, learning, and life. Technos > Quarterly, 2(4) ToolsInteractive whiteboards= Interactive whiteboards are used in many schools as replacements for standard whiteboards and provide a way to allow students to interact with material on the computer. In addition, some interactive whiteboards software allow teachers to record their instruction. *3D virtual environments are also used with interactive whiteboards as a way for students to interact with 3D virtual learning objects employing kinetics and haptic touch the classroom. An example of the use of this technique is the open-source project Edusim. *Research has been carried out to track the worldwide Interactive Whiteboard market by Decision Tree Consulting (DTC), a worldwide research company. According to the results, interactive Whiteboards continue to be the biggest technology revolution in classrooms, across the world there are over 1.2 million boards installed, over 5 million classrooms are forecast to have Interactive Whiteboards installed by 2011, Americas are the biggest region closely followed by EMEA, and Mexico's Enciclomedia project to equip 145,000 classrooms is worth $1.8 billion and is the largest education technology project in the world. *Interactive whiteboards can accommodate different learning styles, such as visual, tactile, and audio. Interactive Whiteboards are another way that technology is expanding in schools. By assisting the teacher to helping students more kinestically as well as finding different ways to process there information throughout the entire classroom. =Student response systems= Student response systems consist of handheld remote control units, or response pads, which are operated by individual students. An infrared or radio frequency receiver attached to the teacher's computer collects the data submitted by students. The CPS (Classroom Performance System), once set, allows the teacher to pose a question to students in several formats. Students then use the response pad to send their answer to the infrared sensor. Data collected from these systems is available to the teacher in real time and can be presented to the students in a graph form on an LCD projector. The teacher can also access a variety of reports to collect and analyze student data. These systems have been used in higher education science courses since the 1970s and have become popular in K-12 classrooms beginning in the early 21st century. Audience response systems (ARS) can help teachers analyze, and act upon student feedback more efficiently. For example, with polleverywhere.com, students text in answers via mobile devices to warm-up or quiz questions. The class can quickly view collective responses to the multiple-choice questions electronically, allowing the teacher to differentiate instruction and learn where students need help most. Combining ARS with peer learning via collaborative discussions has also been proven to be particularly effective. When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually, then discuss it with their neighbors, and then vote again on the same or a conceptually similar question, the percentage of correct student responses usually increases, even in groups where no student had given the correct answer previously. Among other tools that have been noted as being effective as a way of technology integration are podcasts, digital cameras, smart phones, tablets, digital media, and blogs.Other examples of technology integration include translation memories and smart computerized translation programs that are among the newest integrations that are changing the field of linguistics. Mobile learning Mobile learning is defined as \\"learning across multiple contexts, through social and content interactions, using personal electronic devices\\". A mobile device is essentially any device that is portable and has internet access and includes tablets, smart phones, cell phones, e-book readers, and MP3 players. As mobile devices become increasingly common personal devices of K-12 students, some educators seek to utilize downloadable applications and interactive games to help facilitate learning. This practice can be controversial because many parents and educators are concerned that students would be off-task because teachers cannot monitor their activity. This is currently being troubleshooted by forms of mobile learning that require a log-in, acting as a way to track engagement of students. =Benefits= According to findings from four meta analyses, blending technology with face-to-face teacher time generally produces better outcomes than face-to-face or online learning alone. Research is currently limited on the specific features of technology integration that improve learning. Meanwhile, the marketplace of learning technologies continues to grow and vary widely in content, quality, implementation, and context of use. Research shows that adding technology to K-12 environments, alone, does not necessarily improve learning. What matters most to implementing mobile learning is how students and teachers use technology to develop knowledge and skills and that requires training. Successful technology integration for learning goes hand in hand with changes in teacher training, curricula, and assessment practices. An example of teacher professional development is profiled in Edutopia's Schools That Work series on eMints, a program that offers teachers 200 hours of coaching and training in technology integration over a two-year span. In these workshops teachers are trained in practices such as using interactive whiteboards and the latest web tools to facilitate active learning. In a 2010 publication of Learning Point Associates, statistics showed that students of teachers who had participated in eMints had significantly higher standardized test scores than those attained by their peers. It can keep students focused for longer periods of time. The use of computers to look up information/ data is a tremendous time saver, especially when used to access a comprehensive resource like the Internet to conduct research. This time-saving aspect can keep students focused on a project much longer than they would with books and paper resources, and it helps them develop better learning through exploration and research. Project-based activities Definition: Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge. Project Based Activities is a method of teaching where the students gain knowledge and skills by involving themselves for the more period of time to research and respond to the engaging and complex questions, problems, or challenges. the students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging. The students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging, real, curriculum based and frequently relating to more than one branch of knowledge. Therefore, a well designed project based learning activity is one which addresses different student learning styles and which does not assume that all students can demonstrate their knowledge in a single standard way. Elements The project based learning activities involves four basic elements. # An extended time frame. # Collaboration. # Inquiry, investigation and research. # The construction of an artifact or performance of a consequential task. Examples of activitiesCyberHunt= The term \\"hunt\\" refers to finding or searching for something. \\"CyberHunt\\" means an online activity which learners use the internet as tool to find answers to the question's based upon the topics which are assigned by someone else. Hence learners also can design the CyberHunt on some specific topics. a CyberHunt, or internet scavenger hunt, is a project- based activity which helps students gain experience in exploring and browsing the internet. A CyberHunt may ask students to interact with the site (e.g.: play a game or watch a video), record short answers to teacher questions, as well as read and write about a topic in depth. There are basically two types of CyberHunt: *A simple task, in which the teacher develops a series of questions and gives the students a hypertext link to the URL that will give them the answer. *A more complex task, intended for increasing and improving student internet search skills. Teachers ask questions for students to answer using a search engine. =WebQuests= It is an inquiry oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by the learners which are drawn out by the internet/web. It is designed to use learner 'time well', to focus on using information rather than on looking for it and to support the learners to think at the level of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. It is the wonderful way of capturing student's imagination and allowing them to explore in a guided, meaningful manner. It allow the students to explore issues and find their own answers. There are six building blocks of webQuests: # The introduction ‚Äì capturing the student's interest. # The task-describing the activities end product. #The resources-web sites, students will use to complete the task. # The evaluation-measuring the result of the activity. # The conclusion-summing up of the activity. WebQuests are student-centered, web-based curricular units that are interactive and use Internet resources. The purpose of a webQuest is to use information on the web to support the instruction taught in the classroom. A webQuest consists of an introduction, a task (or final project that students complete at the end of the webQuest), processes (or instructional activities), web-based resources, evaluation of learning, reflection about learning, and a conclusion. = WISE = The Web- based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) provides a platform for creating inquiry science projects for middle school and high school students using evidence and resources from the Web. Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, WISE has been developed at the University of California, Berkeley from 1996 until the present. WISE inquiry projects include diverse elements such as online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools, as well as links to relevant web resources. It is the research-focused, open-source inquiry- based learning management system that includes the student- learning environment project authoring environment, grading tool, and tool and user/ course/ content management tools. = Virtual field trip = A virtual field trip is a website that allows the students to experience places, ideas, or objects beyond the constraints of the classroom. A virtual field trip is a great way to allow the students to explore and experience new information. This format is especially helpful and beneficial in allowing schools to keep the cost down. Virtual field trips may also be more practical for children in the younger grades, due to the fact that there is not a demand for chaperones and supervision. Although, a virtual field trip does not allow the children to have the hands on experiences and the social interactions that can and do take place on an actual field trip. An educator should incorporate the use of hands on material to further their understanding of the material that is presented and experienced in a virtual field trip.It is a guided exploration through the www that organizes a collection of pre- screened, its thematically based web pages into a structure online learning experience = ePortfolio = An ePortfolio is a collection of student work that exhibits the student's achievements in one or more areas over time. Components in a typical student ePortfolio might contain creative writings, paintings, photography, math explorations, music, and videos. And it is a collection of work developed across varied contexts over time. The portfolio can advance learning by providing students and/or faculty with a way to organize, archive and display pieces of work.

He was the chairman of Charlton Athletic on several occasions since the 1990s up until November 2019. Murray founded Avesco plc, the specialist services provider to the entertainment & sports industry in 1984, and was Chairman/owner of it for over 30 years. In 1988 he received, on behalf of the company, the Emmy Award for services to the television industry. A subsidiary of Avesco, which grew into a major giant- screen display company, was hired for the London, Beijing, and Rio Olympics Opening & Closing ceremonies. It also covered music festivals. The company grew to 700 employees world-wide and in late 2016, was sold to NEP, the global television broadcast provider. Murray joined the board of Charlton Athletic F.C. in the early 1990s and is credited with being one of the key people in helping the club move back to The Valley in December 1992. He became chairman of the board at Charlton in 1995. During the first twelve years of Murray's tenure they saw two promotions to the Premier League and seven seasons in the top flight, it being the club's most successful period. Their fortunes on the pitch declined after Alan Curbishley's departure from Charlton in 2006, suffering relegation from the Premier League in 2007. Over a period of several years Charlton were linked with a series of takeovers. These were actively encouraged by Murray as a means of solving Charlton's increasing financial problems. In December 2010 it was announced that the club had been sold to Charlton Athletic Holdings Ltd, a Swiss-registered company owned by Michael Slater and Tony Jimenez; Michael Slater immediately replaced Murray as chairman, and Murray remained a director of Charlton Athletic. He was appointed as non-executive chairman of Charlton in January 2014, following Roland Duch√¢telet's takeover of the club having resigned his Chairmanship, and became a non-executive Director. Murray's wife died in 2003. He has two children.

They are recognizably different from other soaps because they are translucent. The clarity is due to the alignment of the soap molecules, which can be induced through the addition of alcohol and sugar. This is usually done for homemade glycerin soaps that are not remeltable. The process for making glycerin soaps was well known as of 1857 in the Western world. In modern industrial soap-making, the glycerin is usually separated from the soap to be resold and used in a wide variety of areas such as for personal care products, pharmaceuticals, chemical intermediates, and food processing. Production Glycerin soap is made by melting and continuously heating soap that has been partially dissolved in a high percentage alcohol solution until the mixture reaches a clear, jelly-like consistency. The alcohol is added to a slow cooked hot-processed soap and then simmered with a sugar solution until the soap is clear or translucent, and then the simmered soap is chilled in a freezer. With home- and hand-made soaps that still contain glycerin left over from saponification, the grating, melting and cooking can proceed without the addition of anything into the mixture, though sugar or more glycerin is sometimes added. Glycerin soap can also be produced without remelting soap through directly cooking raw home-made soap. Modern clear glycerin soaps bases are produced by combining various glycerol and polyols with soap and other surfactants in a manner similar to traditional glycerin soap making methods. These modern clear soaps have the benefit of being easily re-meltable and are often sold in bulk to customers for melt-and-pour soap crafting.

It marked a radical departure from the band's first full-length, As the Flower Withers. Martin Powell's violin playing had become fully integrated into the band's sound, whilst vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe mixed death metal growls and grunts with the spoken word and an often plaintive singing voice. The first (\\"Sear Me MCMXCIII\\") and final (\\"Black God\\") tracks dispensed with guitars, bass and drums altogether, while the album was also far slower and longer than its predecessor. For these reasons, Turn Loose the Swans is often considered to be important in the development of the death-doom sound My Dying Bride helped pioneer and also foreshadows the gothic metal elements that would dominate their subsequent albums. Though far from straightforward, Aaron Stainthorpe's lyrics were much less complex than those employed on As the Flower Withers. He abstained from the use of non-English phrases, and explicitly addressed themes such as anti-Christianity and lovelorn longing. \\"Black God\\" took its lyrics from the last eight lines of a poem called \\"Ah! The Shepherd's Mournful Fate\\" by the 18th-century Scottish poet William Hamilton. The artwork for the release was designed and created by Aaron Stainthorpe and Andrew Craighan. Song information * \\"Sear Me MCMXCIII\\" was the second in a trilogy of songs to bear the title, preceded by the doom-metal orientated \\"Sear Me\\" in 1992 and followed by \\"Sear Me III\\" in 1999, which is similar in style to the original, being a full band composition. The version on this album however, features only the vocals of Aaron Stainthorpe and the keyboards and violin of Martin Powell. It also features different lyrics to the other two versions. * A video was made for \\"The Songless Bird\\" which features slow motion footage of the band running through wilderness, at this stage becoming something of a tradition. The video can be found on \\"For Darkest Eyes\\". * A remix of \\"The Crown Of Sympathy\\" was featured on the band's third single, \\"I Am the Bloody Earth\\". This version of the song featured more echoing effects, a shorter outro and a heavy emphasis on Rick Miah's drum sound. * The 2003 reissue of the album featured as bonus tracks; \\"Le Cerf Malade\\", an instrumental from \\"The Thrash Of Naked Limbs\\", \\"Transcending (Into The Exquisite)\\", a remix of songs from this album taken from the later EP \\"I Am the Bloody Earth\\", and a live performance of \\"Your Shameful Heaven\\" from the bonus CD of \\"The Angel and the Dark River\\". * Live versions of songs from this album can be found on \\"For Darkest Eyes\\" (all songs except \\"Black God\\") and \\"The Voice of the Wretched\\" (Turn Loose The Swans, The Snow In My Hand and Your River).

The church promptly sued for libel, adding Queen to the dozens of British publications that it had already sued.Church of Scientology of California v. Queen Magazine Ltd., High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, 1970-C-No. 5751. Undeterred, Cooper expanded her article into a full-length book, The Scandal of Scientology (subtitled \\"A chilling examination of the nature, beliefs and practices of the \\"now religion'\\"). It was published by Tower Publications, Inc. of New York in the summer of 1971. The church responded by suing her in December 1971, demanding $300,000 for \\"untrue, libelous and defamatory statements about the Church.\\"Church of Scientology of California vs. Paulette Cooper, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court, Docket No. C18558 1972‚Äì1976: Operations Daniel and Dynamite Cooper was seen as a high- priority target by the church's Guardian's Office, which acted as a combination of intelligence agency, legal office and public relations bureau for the church. As early as February 29, 1972, the church's third most senior official, Jane Kember, sent a directive to Terry Milner, the Deputy Guardian for Intelligence United States (DGIUS), instructing him to collect information about Paulette Cooper so that she could be \\"handled.\\"United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum; pp. 23-25 In response, Milner ordered his subordinates to \\"attack her in as many ways as possible\\" and undertake \\"wide-scale exposure of PC's sex life\\", a plan which was named Operation Daniel.DG Info US, \\"Re: Intell US Weekly Report W/E 25 Sept & 5 Oct 72\\", 10 October 1972 Cooper counter-sued on March 30, 1972, demanding $15.4 million in damages for the ongoing harassment.Paulette Cooper vs. Church of Scientology of New York, et al., Supreme Court of State of New York, County of New York, Index No. 6732/72 However, the church stepped up the harassment, for instance painting her name and phone number on street walls so that she would receive obscene phone calls, and subscribing her to pornographic mailing lists. She also received anonymous death threats and her neighbors received letters claiming that she had a venereal disease. The second of the two forged bomb threats In December 1972, the church launched a new attack called Operation Dynamite, an attempt to frame Copper for supposedly making bomb threats against the Church of Scientology. That month, a woman ostensibly soliciting funds for United Farm Workers stole a quantity of stationery from Cooper's apartment. A few days later, the New York Church of Scientology \\"received\\" two anonymous bomb threats. The following May, Cooper was indicted for making the bomb threats and arraigned for a federal grand jury. The threats had been written on her stationery, which was marked with her fingerprints. The charges were eventually dropped in 1975 with the filing of a nolle prosequi order by the local US Attorney's office, but it was not until the fall of 1977 that the FBI discovered that the bomb threats had been staged by the Guardian's Office. A contemporary memorandum sent between two Guardian's Office staff noted on a list of jobs successfully accomplished: \\"Conspired to entrap Mrs. Lovely into being arrested for a felony which she did not commit. She was arraigned for the crime.\\" The church sued Cooper again in 1975 in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia in 1976.Church of Scientology and Paulette Cooper (Spinster), High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, No. 1975-C-No. 8345Church of Scientology of Detroit, Michigan, vs. Paulette Cooper and John Does and Mary Rowes, persons to be ascertained, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, No. 75-70203The Church of the New Faith, Inc. and Miss Paulette Cooper and Tower Publications, Inc., No. 4297 of 1976. The church itself imported Cooper's books into foreign countries for the express purpose of suing her in jurisdictions where the libel laws were stricter than in the United States. 1976: Operation Freakout Part of the planning document for Operation Freakout, April 1976 In the spring of 1976, the Guardian Office leadership decided to initiate an operation with the aim \\"To get P.C. incarcerated in a mental institution or jail, or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks.\\" The planning document, dated April 1, 1976, declared the aim to be \\"[t]o remove PC from her position of power so that she cannot attack the C of S .\\" In its initial form Operation Freakout consisted of three different plans (or \\"channels\\", as the Guardian's Office termed them), tailored to implicate her by her Jewish descent: # First, a woman was to imitate Paulette Cooper's voice and make telephone threats to Arab consulates in New York City. # Second, a threatening letter was to be mailed to an Arab consulate in such a fashion that it would appear to have been done by Paulette Cooper. # Third, a Scientologist volunteer was to impersonate Paulette Cooper at a laundromat and threaten the current president Gerald Ford and then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. A second Scientologist would thereafter inform the FBI of the threat. Two additional plans were added to Operation Freakout on April 13, 1976. The fourth plan called for Scientologist agents to gather information from Cooper so that the success of the first three plans could be assessed. The fifth plan was for a Scientologist to warn an Arab consulate by telephone that Paulette Cooper had been talking about bombing it. A sixth and final plan was added subsequently. It was effectively a re-run of the 1972 plot, requiring Scientologists to obtain Paulette Cooper's fingerprints on a blank piece of paper, type a threatening letter to Kissinger on that paper, and mail it. Guardian's Office staff member Bruce Raymond noted in an internal memo: \\"This additional channel should really have put her away. Worked with all the other channels. The F.B.I. already think she did the bomb threats on the C of S .\\" On March 31, 1976, Jane Kember telexed Henning Heldt, the Deputy Guardian U.S., to update him on the situation: > PC is still resisting paying the money but the judgement stands in PT ... > Have her lawyer contacted and also arrange for PC to get the data that we > can slap the writs on her. If you want legal docs, from here on we will > provide. Then if she still declines to come we slap the writs on her before > she reaches CW as we don't want to be seen being brutal to such a pathetic > victim from a concentration camp. Exposure and aftermath United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 1979 Ultimately, Operation Freakout was never put into effect. On June 11, 1976, two Scientology agents‚ÄîMichael Meisner and Gerald Bennett Wolfe‚Äîwere caught in the act of attempted burglary at a courthouse in Washington, D.C. as part of the Guardian's Office's ongoing Operation Snow White - a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The Guardian's Office was preoccupied for the next year with attempts to hush up the scandal, even going to the lengths of kidnapping Meisner and holding him incommunicado to prevent him from testifying. The church sought to bring a quick end to the dispute with Cooper in December 1976 when it proposed to settle with her, on condition that she was not to republish or comment on The Scandal of Scientology and agree to assign the book's copyright to the Church of Scientology of California. On July 8, 1977, however, the FBI raided Scientology offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., seizing over 48,000 documents. They revealed the extent to which the Church had committed \\"criminal campaigns of vilification, burglaries and thefts ... against private and public individuals and organizations\\", as the U.S. Government prosecutor put it. The documents were later released to the public, enabling Cooper and the world at large to learn about the details of Operation Freakout. Sometime during late 1977, according to an affidavit given by Margery Wakefield, a secret meeting was held at the Guardian's Office where two murders were planned. The first of which was of a young man who had defected from Scientology and had been recaptured, and the second was an assassination of Cooper in which they were planning to shoot her dead. It is unknown whether or not these plans were attempted. Although in the end nobody was indicted for the harassment of Cooper, the wider campaign of criminal activity was successfully prosecuted by the United States Government. Mary Sue Hubbard, Jane Kember, Henning Heldt, Morris Budlong, Duke Snider, Dick Weigand, Greg Willardson, Mitchell Hermann and Cindy Raymond were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of theft, burglary, conspiracy, and other crimes. With the exception of Kember and Budlong, the defendants agreed to uncontested stipulation of the evidence.United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard, et al. , Sentencing Memorandum, Criminal Case No. 78-401 (1979), pp. 56-59. Kember and Budlong were convicted separately after being extradited from the United Kingdom. All of the defendants were imprisoned, serving up to four years in jail. Coincidentally, they were tried, convicted and sentenced in the same courthouse that their agents had been caught robbing. The Church of Scientology filed at least 19 lawsuits against Cooper throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which Cooper considered part of \\"a typical Scientology dirty-tricks campaign\\" and which Cooper's attorney Michael Flynn said was motivated by L. Ron Hubbard's declaration that the purpose of a lawsuit was to \\"harass and discourage\\". Cooper discontinued her legal actions against Scientology in 1985 after receiving an out-of-court settlement.

The prison is the largest federal correctional institution in Canada with a population of approximately 625 housed in five units. History Construction of Warkworth Institution started on March 26, 1965 on of land that had been purchased by the Department of Justice. In 1967, the institution began operation entirely with staff and no inmate population. In September 1967, ten blocks were opened and the first six inmates arrived from Joyceville Institution. The official opening took place on October 14, 1967. At the end of the 1968 fiscal year, the facility housed 92 inmates. In 1971, the Living Unit concept was introduced. The Warkworth prison, opened in 1967, lies just inside the Brighton border and is a major financial contributor to the municipality. The federal prison does not technically pay property taxes, but the government gives the amount in a grant to the municipality. The Warkworth Institution gives Brighton $602,000 each year, which is almost 16 per cent of the municipality's budget. The jail also gives Northumberland County a grant of $168,500. A riot broke out at approximately 9:00pm on July 21, 2009, during which prisoners took control of the prison infirmary. Subsequently, one inmate died of a drug overdose in his cell. Inmates broke the cement that acts as bars across the outside windows of the cells. By doing this inmates were able to get out of their cells. This can be seen when walking to the gym on 9 block (unit 1) there are different style cement bars. Warkworth is a sister institution to Springhill, NS; Cowansville, PQ; and Drumheller, AB.

They are native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Americas, from the southernmost United States (Florida, Texas: day-blooming cestrum, C. diurnum) south to the B√≠o-B√≠o Region in central Chile (green cestrum, C. parqui). They are colloquially known as cestrums or jessamines (from \\"jasmine\\", due to their fragrant flowers). They are shrubs growing to tall. Most are evergreen; a few are deciduous. All parts of the plants are toxic, causing severe gastroenteritis if eaten. Uses and ecology Several species are grown as ornamental plants for their strongly scented flowers. Numerous cultivars have been produced for garden use, of which ‚ÄòNewellii‚Äô has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. (confirmed 2017). Some are invasive species. Especially notorious is green cestrum (C. parqui) in Australia, where it can cause serious losses to livestock which eat the leaves (particularly of drying broken branches) unaware of their toxicity.North West Weeds (2003): Green cestrum . Version of 2003-APR-15. Retrieved 2007-NOV-14. C. laevigatum is employed by wajacas (shamans) of the Krah√¥ tribe in Brazil. It is used \\"to see far\\", i.e. to aid in divination. Like the other hallucinogenic plants consumed by them, Cra√≥s wajacas consider it a potent entheogen, not to be taken by the uninitiated. Cestrum species are used as food by the caterpillars of several Lepidoptera species. These include the glasswing (Greta oto), the Antillean clearwing (Greta diaphanus) and Manduca afflicta, which possibly feeds only on day- blooming cestrum. It is either known or suspected that such Lepidoptera are able to sequester the toxins from the plant, making them noxious to many predators. Cestrum species are reported as piscicidal.

The Coachmen was Moore's first band; their live performances were his first times performing in N.Y.C. clubs in an artistic milieu. They played at CBGB, Max's Kansas City, Tier 3, A's (curated by Arleen Schloss), The Botany Talk House, The 80's, S.N.A.F.U., and loft parties thrown by Jenny Holzer. Their penultimate performance was at Giorgio Gomelsky's N.Y.C. loft. It was there that Thurston Moore met Kim Gordon. Some simpatico bands The Coachmen were billed with were The Green Scene, Paul McMahon's A Band, Phoebe Legere's Monad, Harry Toledo, and the Fluks, a band that included guitarist Lee Ranaldo who would wind up in Sonic Youth with Moore.

The 1996 re-release contains one bonus track \\"The Sexuality of Bereavement\\" and a bonus CD titled Live at the Dynamo. The Live CD was recorded during their appearance at the Dynamo Festival in 1995. Aaron Stainthorpe's lyrics continued in the vein of Turn Loose the Swans (focusing on religious symbolism and relationship problems), whilst non-English phrases were omitted once more. Stainthorpe has said in many interviews that \\"Two Winters Only\\" is his favourite My Dying Bride song. Five of the album's six tracks appear on the band's VHS and DVD For Darkest Eyes. Production For the first time in the band‚Äôs history, guitar player Andrew Craighan was the sole composer of a My Dying Bride record, which was considered ‚Äústrange‚Äù to the guitarist. Many song ideas for The Angel and the Dark River were completed during the recording of the album at Academy Studios. Craighan cites \\"The Cry of Mankind\\" as an example: \\"we had the vocals, we had that guitar line [Calvin Robertshaw's repetitive arpeggio background guitar], we had the drums and the bass. The other guitar line, the heavier guitar line, was non-existent.\\" Musical style The Angel and the Dark River was arguably the release that saw the band travel furthest from their death metal origins. Aaron Stainthorpe dispensed with his death grunt entirely, and Martin Powell's violin and keyboard playing now seemed to be the basis around which the rest of the arrangement was built. Apart from the final track of the original release (\\"Your Shameful Heaven\\"), the tempo was unremittingly slow. Themes This water-charged inspiration comes from their home, the north of England.

Harris himself made the invitation, phoning Andrew Craighan to tell him that he thought The Angel and the Dark River was \\"a killer album\\".

This is derived from the theorem that there is no greatest cardinal number. In informal terms, the paradox is that the collection of all possible \\"infinite sizes\\" is not only infinite, but so infinitely large that its own infinite size cannot be any of the infinite sizes in the collection. The difficulty is handled in axiomatic set theory by declaring that this collection is not a set but a proper class; in von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory it follows from this and the axiom of limitation of size that this proper class must be in bijection with the class of all sets. Thus, not only are there infinitely many infinities, but this infinity is larger than any of the infinities it enumerates. This paradox is named for Georg Cantor, who is often credited with first identifying it in 1899 (or between 1895 and 1897). Like a number of \\"paradoxes\\" it is not actually contradictory but merely indicative of a mistaken intuition, in this case about the nature of infinity and the notion of a set. Put another way, it is paradoxical within the confines of na√Øve set theory and therefore demonstrates that a careless axiomatization of this theory is inconsistent. Statements and proofs In order to state the paradox it is necessary to understand that the cardinal numbers admit an ordering, so that one can speak about one being greater or less than another. Then Cantor's paradox is: :Theorem: There is no greatest cardinal number. This fact is a direct consequence of Cantor's theorem on the cardinality of the power set of a set. :Proof: Assume the contrary, and let C be the largest cardinal number. Then (in the von Neumann formulation of cardinality) C is a set and therefore has a power set 2C which, by Cantor's theorem, has cardinality strictly larger than C. Demonstrating a cardinality (namely that of 2C) larger than C, which was assumed to be the greatest cardinal number, falsifies the definition of C. This contradiction establishes that such a cardinal cannot exist. Another consequence of Cantor's theorem is that the cardinal numbers constitute a proper class. That is, they cannot all be collected together as elements of a single set. Here is a somewhat more general result. :Theorem: If S is any set then S cannot contain elements of all cardinalities. In fact, there is a strict upper bound on the cardinalities of the elements of S. :Proof: Let S be a set, and let T be the union of the elements of S. Then every element of S is a subset of T, and hence is of cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of T. Cantor's theorem then implies that every element of S is of cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of 2T. Discussion and consequences Since the cardinal numbers are well-ordered by indexing with the ordinal numbers (see Cardinal number, formal definition), this also establishes that there is no greatest ordinal number; conversely, the latter statement implies Cantor's paradox. By applying this indexing to the Burali-Forti paradox we obtain another proof that the cardinal numbers are a proper class rather than a set, and (at least in ZFC or in von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory) it follows from this that there is a bijection between the class of cardinals and the class of all sets. Since every set is a subset of this latter class, and every cardinality is the cardinality of a set (by definition!) this intuitively means that the \\"cardinality\\" of the collection of cardinals is greater than the cardinality of any set: it is more infinite than any true infinity. This is the paradoxical nature of Cantor's \\"paradox\\". Historical notes While Cantor is usually credited with first identifying this property of cardinal sets, some mathematicians award this distinction to Bertrand Russell, who defined a similar theorem in 1899 or 1901.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 12 December 1989. Zoe was involved in many major storylines during her time on the show, including the deaths of her father Frank (Norman Bowler) and brother Chris (Peter Amory), the betrayal and departure of her stepmother Kim (Claire King), coming out as gay and a battle with schizophrenia. Zoe became the first lesbian character in a British soap opera when she came out in 1993. She departed on 22 September 2005. Storylines Zoe's family move to Beckindale, while she is at university studying to be a veterinary surgeon. Following her graduation, Zoe also moves to the village and finds employment at a surgery in Hotten. Zoe helps deliver Elsa Feldmann's (Naomi Lewis) baby and she becomes involved in a protest march for animal rights. Zoe leaves the village when she gets a job as a flying vet in New Zealand. She returns the following year and helps Frank with his drinking problem, which he developed during the breakdown of his marriage to Kim. Zoe has a one-night stand with Elsa's brother, Michael (Matthew Vaughan) and a fling with Archie Brooks (Tony Pitts). Zoe eventually tells Archie that she is gay. Zoe meets interior designer Emma Nightingale (Rachel Ambler) and they begin a relationship. Zoe is almost raped by Ken Adlington (Douglas McFerran), but she fights him off and Emma tries to convince her to tell the police. Zoe refuses and Ken denies the attack happened. Frank gets revenge for Zoe by publicly humiliating Ken. Emma and Zoe decide to have a blessing. Emma's ex-girlfriend, Susie Wilde (Louise Heaney), turns up in the village and Zoe falls for her. Shortly after the blessing ceremony, Zoe leaves Emma for Susie. Zoe and Susie's relationship ends when Susie has an affair with another woman. Zoe sets up a veterinary practice with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). She is devastated when she discovers Frank has died. She begins dating Sophie Wright (Jane Cameron), the nanny for Frank and Kim's son James Tate (Sam Silson). They break up when Zoe wants to start a family but Sophie does not. Zoe initially resists the married Becky Cairns' (Sarah Neville) advances but later has a fling with her. She later develops a crush on truck driver, Frankie Smith (Madeleine Bowyer). Chris is kidnapped by Liam Hammond (Mark Powley), who reveals he is Frank's illegitimate child. Zoe rescues her brother and shoots Liam dead. Chris and Zoe try to cover up the crime and a jury reaches a verdict of lawful killing. Zoe then gets together with Frankie. Zoe is not happy when Chris moves Charity Dingle into Home Farm and gives her a job as his assistant. However, Charity and Zoe begin an affair, but when Zoe starts exhibiting obsessive behaviour towards Charity, it ends. Zoe starts blackmailing Charity, who confesses the affair to Chris. He chooses Charity over Zoe and she becomes depressed. Zoe then begins talking to her deceased father and she sets fire to the church. During one of her early schizophrenic episodes she ends up having sex with Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) but has no memory of the event. Zoe is sectioned and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She also discovers she is pregnant, with no idea how it happened, and she considers having an abortion. After seeing the baby during a scan, Zoe changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption instead. Zoe later chooses to keep her baby and she gives birth to a daughter named Jean (Megan Pearson). Zoe returns to work at the veterinary surgery in the village and she hires Chloe Atkinson (Amy Nuttall) to be Jean's nanny. When Zoe notices Jean is crying more often, she takes her to the hospital and is told that Jean has a couple of broken ribs. Syd Woolfe (Nathan Gladwell) eventually confesses that Jean's injuries occurred when he and Chloe took their eyes off her when they were together. Zoe immediately fires Chloe. Scott realises that he is Jean's father and when Zoe finds out she becomes convinced that he raped her. Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) tells Zoe that she had in fact had sex with him before being diagnosed and Zoe accepts that she willingly had sex with Scott, albeit with no recollection of the incident. Chris commits suicide and frames Charity for murder. Charity becomes aware that Zoe knows the truth and tries to seduce her. However, this does not change Zoe's mind and she testifies that Charity killed Chris. Charity is found guilty and sent to prison. She later gives birth to Zoe's nephew, Noah (Alfie Mortimer). Zoe, in her time of loneliness and feeling like her daughter should have a mother and father in her life has a very brief relationship with Scott, she tries to be romantic with him, but since she is obviously not attracted to him, she has an affair with Rachel Whatmore (Zoe Lambert). Charity agrees to give Zoe custody of Noah for the evidence that Chris committed suicide. Zoe tries to adopt Noah, but she is refused permission. Noah is later returned to his mother. Zoe continues to run Home Farm and the businesses Chris left her, aided by estate manager Callum Rennie (Andrew Whipp) and nanny Effie Harrison (Phillipa Peak). Zoe plans to emigrate to New Zealand with Jean and Joseph. Zoe takes revenge on Scott after she learns he was going to betray her and lets him think that they are going to reunite and when he proposes, she turns him down. Stating she would, rather \\"put needles in her eyes\\". Scott then attacks Zoe and attempts to rape her. Initially trying to defend herself, Zoe injects him with ketamine. However, when Scott falls unconscious, she injects him again and is later arrested for attempted murder. Effie reveals her feelings for Zoe and shortly before she is due to stand trial, Zoe plans to run away with her and the children. At the airport, Sadie King (Patsy Kensit) appears and blackmails Zoe into returning home and selling Home Farm to her at a reduced price. When Zoe returns home, Effie pleads with her to understand, but Zoe punches her. She stands trial for attempted murder and is freed when Paddy reveals that Scott was angry on the night of the attack and had threatened him. Zoe packs up Home Farm and plans to leave with Callum, who refuses to stay behind with the Kings. Zoe and Callum break a gas pipe and set a timer to go off just as Tom (Ken Farrington), Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Max King (Charlie Kemp) arrive. Callum stops the car and he and Zoe watch the house explode before driving away. When James (now Alexander Lincoln) returned in 2019, he and Paddy talked about vets and his reason he wanted to be a vet was down to Zoe's days as a vet. Casting Two years after graduating from the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and having only done theatre and commercial work, Bracknell was cast in the role of Zoe. She made her first on screen appearance on 12 December 1989.Parkin 2002, p.134. In March 2005, Bracknell announced she was to take a nine-month break from Emmerdale. A reporter for the BBC said she would leave in the autumn following a dramatic storyline involving Zoe. Bracknell said \\"I am looking forward to spending some time with my family and having the opportunity to pursue other projects. I will also be finishing my teaching diploma in yoga which is something I am passionate about.\\" Series producer Kath Beedles said she wished Bracknell all the best and looked forward to welcoming her back in the future. Beedles added that Bracknell had made \\"a huge contribution to Emmerdale's ongoing success.\\" Despite initial reports that it would be a temporary break, Bracknell never returned to Emmerdale. DevelopmentCharacterisation= Zoe arrived in the village a month after her father, Frank (Norman Bowler), stepmother Kim (Claire King) and brother Chris (Peter Amory) moved into Home Farm.Hayward 1997, p.80. Chris and Zoe's mother, Jean, died of cancer. Originally studying to be a veterinary surgeon, Zoe later started a veterinary practice in Emmerdale. In his 2002 book, 30 Years of Emmerdale, Lance Parkin noted that Zoe stuck up for what she believed in and was committed to animal rights and welfare. Parkin described Zoe as \\"charitable and reasonable compared with the other Tates\\". He said while Zoe had a romantic streak, she also had a dark side, which often saw her become moody and angry. Bracknell said of her character in 2005: \\"She was very unpredictable which I liked. She wasn't a victim but she had lots of problems to deal with and at the same time she could be very Tate-like, ruthless and sometimes violent.\\" =Sexuality= In early 1993, Zoe decided that she wanted more from her friendship with Archie Brooks (Tony Pitts), and the two later began a relationship. Zoe struggled to deal with the physical aspect of their relationship and she realised that she was a lesbian. Inside Soap's Richard Arnold commented that apart from a one-night stand with Michael Feldmann (Matthew Vaughan) and an older man, Patrick, who she once brought home for Christmas, Zoe did not have much experience with men and the mystery behind that had finally been revealed. Bracknell explained that Zoe was not aware of her sexuality when she decided to have sex with Archie and said \\"Zoe wanted to sleep with Archie to put her fears to rest but she didn't do it to prove anything. She didn't count out the possibility that it could all work out with him.\\" Bracknell added that Archie would be gutted by the news, but Zoe would want to remain his friend. Bracknell thought Zoe's sexuality would be \\"a big hurdle to cross\\" with her family, especially with Frank who Zoe was very close to. Arnold reported that Zoe's bad luck with men was one reason why the show's producers felt the storyline could work for the character. He added that lesbianism had not been tackled before in a British soap. Of how the storyline unfolds, Bracknell explained \\"Zoe is quite feminine and not the obvious media stereotype of a lesbian, but the writers aren't taking any sort of moral stance. This is something that Zoe discovers gradually and it will be dealt with constructively, emotionally and positively.\\" =Schizophrenia= Zoe was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2002. According to Bracknell, this was the Emmerdale storyline she was most proud of portraying, \\"[b]ecause it dealt with a particular area of mental health and we did it over a relatively long period of time - about ten months - so there was a lot of research involved and the story was ongoing and changing. We had to get the nuts and bolts right and also it wasn't just about how it affected her [Zoe] but also the effect on her family.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Zoe, Bracknell received a nomination for Most Popular Actress at the 8th National Television Awards in 2002. The character's last episode was an hour-long special that aired on 22 September 2005 and was watched by 8.58 million viewers. (No permanent link available. Search for relevant dates.) In 2006, Zoe's departure from the show was named Best Exit by The British Soap Awards. Emmerdale received praise for the way it handled Zoe's sexuality. The Daily Mirror noted in 2002 that despite being a \\"schizophrenic lesbian vet\\", \\"Zoe Tate is actually a fairly credible character,\\" and that \\"[a]fter 10 years, she has served her time as the only serious lesbian in soap.\\" In the 2006 book The Way We Are Now: Gay and Lesbian Lives in the 21st Century, Jane Czyzselska wrote that lesbian characters in British television tended to be \\"issuized\\", but singled out Emmerdale as one of the few exceptions, \\"where vet Zoe Tate is subject to the crazy ideas of the script writers as much as the next heterosexual character.\\" Sarah and Lee from AfterEllen said in 2010: \\"Actress Leah Bracknell left Emmerdale in 2005 and many waved a fond farewell to the longest running and possibly the best representation of a lesbian ever to grace British soap land. Emmerdale is still the only soap to allow its lesbian resident to exist without having to wear a sign around her neck that constantly reinforced her sexuality. Sometimes she was just having a drink, or working or visiting her brother. No other British soap opera has managed this since.\\" The Sunday Mail's Steve Hendry described Zoe as the \\"wealthy, lesbian vet [...] who brought more misery to the Dales than an outbreak of foot and mouth.\\" ReferencesBook references= * * External links *Zoe Tate at MTV3 Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1989 Category:Fictional lesbians Category:Fictional characters with schizophrenia Category:Fictional veterinarians Category:Female villains Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional characters with psychiatric disorders Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional fratricides Category:LGBT villains Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Zoe Tate"},{"id":"2732928","text":"Dorchester Town Football Club are a semi-professional football club, based in Dorchester, Dorset, England. They currently play in the . The club is affiliated to the Dorset County Football Association and is a FA chartered Standard club. They play at the Avenue Stadium, on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. They were founder members of the Conference South in 2004, which was the highest standard they have ever reached, but were relegated after ten years in 2014. History Founded in 1880, Dorchester Town were Dorset Senior Cup finalists in 1888 and 1890 before joining the Dorset League in 1896. Despite being founder members of the league, the club had little success before winning the championship in 1937/38 with a 2‚Äì0 victory at Sherborne on 25 April 1938. The club joined the Western League in 1947, winning promotion from Division Two in 1950, and going on to take the league championship in 1954/55. The fifties proved to be a successful decade for the Magpies, winning the Dorset Senior Cup for the first time, and having a number of good runs in the FA Cup facing the likes of Norwich City, Queens Park Rangers, Port Vale and Plymouth Argyle. In 1954, Dorchester reached the 2nd Round before eventually losing out to York City in front of 5,500 fans at the old Avenue ground, in a season where York went on to reach the semi-finals. Following four more victories in the Dorset Senior Cup, the club entered the Southern League (Division One South) in 1972. They first tasted success in this division when they finished runners-up to Margate in 1977/78, going unbeaten in the final 16 matches of the season, with manager David Best utilising his links with old club AFC Bournemouth to attract former first-teamers such as John O'Rourke, Jack Howarth and Harry Redknapp to the Avenue. The formation of the Alliance League (now the Football Conference) unfortunately meant the Magpies ended up back in the reformed Southern Division a year later, but the club celebrated its centenary by winning the Southern Division in 1979/80 by a one-point margin over Aylesbury. Stuart Bell succeeded David Best as manager during the season, and the Magpies went unbeaten in the last 14 games to clinch the title. A young Trevor Senior impressed alongside ever-present top scorer Paul Thorne, whilst Graham Roberts joined neighbours Weymouth early in the campaign for ¬£6,000 before going on to star for Tottenham Hotspur and England. Senior stayed with Dorchester for a further two seasons, before signing for Portsmouth during the 1981/82 season for ¬£35,000, going on to play for Watford, Middlesbrough and Reading, where he broke the Berkshire club's all-time goalscoring record. Before leaving the Magpies, Senior helped the club reach the 2nd Round of the FA Cup again before losing out to AFC Bournemouth in a replay at Dean Court in front of a crowd of 8,700. A goal four minutes from the end of extra time was enough to end Dorchester's dreams of a place in the third round ‚Äì a feat they have still yet to achieve. Relegated at the end of the 1983/84 season following a severe financial crisis, the club only just avoided dropping out of the league altogether the following year. However, a remarkable turnaround followed, and Dorchester returned to the Premier Division as champions at the end of the 1986/87 season, taking the title following a goalless draw at runners-up Ashford on the final day of the season. The return to the top southern division has been a rollercoaster of emotions for Dorchester fans. Having been a mid-table team for a number of years, a brush with relegation came at the start of the nineties, and Stuart Morgan was introduced as manager in 1993. In his first full season, Morgan took the club to sixth in the league, followed by the sale of Darren Garner to Rotherham United for ¬£30,000 during the summer. The following seasons were a mixture of highs-and-lows, flirting with relegation on a number of occasions, facing Oxford United in the 1st Round of the FA Cup, reaching the last 16 of the FA Trophy for only the second time, and finishing fourth in the Premier Division in 1997/98. Unfortunately in the following seasons, the Magpies were unable to rekindle the same form, and following a number of close-shaves at the wrong end of the table, the club were relegated to the Eastern Division at the end of the 2000/01 season, despite a strong FA Cup run culminating in a 3‚Äì1 First Round defeat at Wigan Athletic's 25,000 all-seater JJB Stadium. Under the guidance of manager Mark Morris, Dorchester's young squad regained their Premier Division status within two years, defeating King's Lynn on the final day of the 2002/03 season to take the Eastern Division title ahead of Eastbourne Borough, having won 16 of their last 17 matches and scoring 114 goals in their 42 league games. A season earlier the Magpies had picked up the Southern League Cup for the first time, again defeating King's Lynn in a 4‚Äì0 aggregate victory in the final. The first season back in the Premier Division was a difficult one but the club succeeded to reach the end-of-season play-offs, where two fine victories over Bath City and Tiverton Town saw Dorchester become a Conference club for the first time in the newly formed Conference South division. A season later the Magpies almost saw further play-off glory, but missed out on another promotion opportunity on the final day of the season, going down 7‚Äì3 at Bognor Regis Town. A mid-table finish the following year ended with the resignation of Mark Morris ‚Äì arguably the club's most successful manager in recent history ‚Äì with Mick Jenkins taking charge of the first team. His reign, however, was short- lived. Despite the club's tenth success in the Dorset Senior Cup, the team narrowly avoided relegation by finishing 17th in the league, and Jenkins was sacked just a month later in the wake of Eddie Mitchell taking over the ownership of the club. Mitchell's arrival at the helm saw former Dorchester midfielder Shaun Brooks installed as Director of Football, and the club announced it would be making the step up to full-time football ready for the 2007/08 season. In September 2014, kitman Alex Legge, aged 38, died suddenly. Community ownership The club is democratically run by its supporters. The club has converted the pitch to 3g opening the start of the 2018/2019 season it now hosts Yeovil Town W.F.C. home games community football and youth training is held regularly on the pitch Colours and badge The club have a long tradition of playing in black and white striped shirts with black shorts and socks at home. For the 2005‚Äì06 season, to celebrate the club's 125th anniversary the home club sported a black and white quartered shirt, similar to the original strip the club was founded in. The away kit is currently sky blue, with previous kits being red, yellow or white. The club's current badge is circular, with the words 'Dorchester Town F.C.' and 'The Magpies' on a white outer rim, in black text. The central area contains two magpies on a brown branch in front of a sky blue background. Above them is a design based upon the town's Coat of arms, a purple circle containing a castle, upon which is a shield. Stadium Dorchester Town play their home games at the Avenue Stadium, Weymouth Avenue, Dorchester, Dorset, DT1 2RY. The Avenue Stadiumis located near to a branch of Tesco on the outskirts of Dorchester. Opened in 1990, it consists of one main stand, which is all-seated, and three small banks of terracing, which are all-standing. A railway line runs along the back of the stadium. Whilst the capacity of the stadium is 5,229, Dorchester tend to attract crowds of around 500‚Äì600, although, during the 1990s, the club regularly achieved 900‚Äì1000 strong attendances. The record attendance at the Avenue Stadium came in the 1999 season, in front of a crowd of 4,159.History of Avenue Stadium Official Dorchester Town FC Website At the start of the 2011/12 season, a sponsorship deal was announced with Greene King IPA, with the stadium being rebranded 'The Greene King IPA Community Stadium'. A recent F.A. Cup game against Plymouth Argyle attracted 3,196 fans to the Avenue. Dorchester beat their League neighbours 1‚Äì0 in a match which was televised live by ESPN in the UK and Fox Network in the USA.

Biography Born in Lahore, Ramprakash Mehra was the President of Board of Control for Cricket in India in 1975/76 and 1976/77, joint secretary between 1960/61 and 1962/63 and Vice President from 1963/64 to 1974/75. He was the head of the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association for nearly fifteen years. Mehra represented Northern India in Ranji Trophy between 1934/35 and 1951/52 and Delhi in 1953/54. His only hundred in the competition was a 209* scored against Maharashtra in the 1940/41 semifinal, despite which his side totalled only 442 and ended up on the losing side. He was in the reserves for the Bombay Pentangular match between Hindus and Europeans in 1943/44. Coming in for Dattu Phadkar at the last moment, he hit 116 notout. He toured England with the Rajputana club in 1938 and stayed back after the tour. Mehra did his B.A. from the Government College University, Lahore and played for the university team for four years from 1935/36. In the last of those years, he played for Indian Universities against the Lord Tennyson's team. He was a right-handed batsman.

The Hierarchy uses their power to control the Avatar, a singular being who is able to amass all of the psionic power of the Ovanan people and wield that power as a weapon called The Collective. To cement their control over Ovanan and the Avatar, the Hierarchy also uses the Avatar to act as an angelic religious figure who stands in judgment of Ovanan children. The Avatar chooses who lives and dies, supposedly for religious purposes. In actuality, he selectively kills anyone who may mature into a threat to the Hierarchy's power base. Sometimes these undesirables are allowed to live as an Ovanan underclass, who are called Variants. An Ovanan man, Aeren, who was raised in the Avatar's household, was secretly allowed to live, despite having an undesirable and dangerous ability: he is a Disruptor, the opposite of the Avatar. While the Avatar gathers and magnifies psionic energy, a Disruptor disrupts energy. This ability can be used in many ways: to stop a heart, cause electrical disruptions in machinery, or to open any lock. Aeren was secretly involved with the Avatar Etan and his young heir Seren. However, after the suspicious death of the Etan, Aeren escaped to Earth, where he married a human woman and fathered five children, of which two survived: Liana and Jason, 15 and 17, who are born with powers they don't understand and can't control. Incarcerated in a mental hospital where they are the subjects of study, Jason becomes suspicious of the Institute's motives, and urges Liana to run away. During their escape, they become separated. Liana encounters a group of humans and an Ovanan man, and his companion, D'mer, also Rieken's lover, who hails from another planet called Kimar, which is under Hierarchy rule. Liana learns that she is an Avatar, and has the powers of the Ovanan godhead. However, her powers interfere with the ability of the Avatar, who currently sits on the Ovanan throne, to control the Collective, and if she is not eliminated, Ovanan is vulnerable as the Avatar is their greatest weapon. Rieken and D'mer go on a quest to find more humans who will help them save Liana, and to prevent Ovanan from exercising power over Earth. In addition to drawing in several humans, they discover a beautiful Ovanan exile named Bast, who was once one of the Avatar's acolytes. Also, they encounter magical beings from Arthurian myth. The implication is that myth and legend is a kind of Earth Collective, a manifestation of human will that has taken a different form than the psionic energy of Ovanan. Jason, meanwhile, is captured by the Hierarchy and tortured by the beautiful but evil Sere. Believing him to be dead, his captors dispose of his body, but he is actually in a drug-induced coma. He is rescued by the Resistance, which is working with Rieken to try to stage a coup and overthrow the Hierarchy. Unknown to Jason and his companions, Rieken is really Seren, the Avatar in disguise, who has quietly been working behind the scenes to try to overthrow the shackles of the oppressive Hierarchy. With Liana on one side, and Jason on another, the two groups rush to a confrontation. CharactersHunter Liana Scott= A fifteen-year-old girl who is born with the power of the Avatar. She has red hair and yellow eyes, and a very small frame. Having been incarcerated in a mental hospital most of her life, she has social skill problems, and is seemingly childlike and innocent, but clever. While her first name is Hunter, she is always referred to as Liana. =Jason Scott= Seventeen years old, Jason is born with the power of a disruptor. For most of his life, he did not realize he had this power, an ability which makes him a dangerous weapon. He has blond hair and blue eyes, and is of medium height. Jason is protective of his sister, and has anger management issues. =Rieken/Seren= Seren is the young Avatar of Ovanan. He has white hair, pale bluish eyes, and is androgynous. He is about seventy years old, which is young for an Ovanan. As a boy, he accidentally absorbed the personality of Rieken, the leader of the Ovanan Resistance. Rieken died, and now Seren uses the personality, and an enhancer to change his appearance, to fight with the Resistance as Rieken. =D'mer ad D'aniri= D'mer is an enslaved hostage of a minor royal family from the planet Kimar. He is a member of the Avatar's household. He has psionic abilities, pyrokinetics and the ability to fly. He has reddish hair, black eyes, is considered quite handsome, and has a sarcastic sense of humor. He and the Avatar are lovers. =Kovar= The Avatar's Shield, a psionic ward. Once the prince of House Teramis, the military race of Ovanan, Kovar gave up his throne out of religious devotion to the Avatar. He is extremely tall and strong, has pale skin, grey eyes, and black hair. =Bast= Once an acolyte of the House of the Avatar, Bast is a beautiful exile who possesses the power to change her shape. It is implied, but never stated, that she is the inspiration for the Egyptian cat goddess. She has black hair and green eyes. =Antonio Minetti= A human policeman who finds Liana in an alley, and falsely believes he has to rescue her from a gang. He agrees to aid Rieken in his fight against the Hierarchy. =Brent Donewitz= A teenaged boy, Hawaiian and Jewish, who is the first to encounter Liana after she escapes the Institute. =Niniri= The leader of the Hierarchy. Deceptively beautiful and calm, she is extremely manipulative. Publication history Work from A Distant Soil was originally published in several fanzines, and was scouted by The Donning Company's Starblaze Graphics editions before being contracted by WaRP Graphics. Doran left after nine issues due to an acrimonious dispute with WaRP, which was falsely accused of attempting to claim copyright and trademark on her work.\\"The Battle for A Distant Soil,\\" The Comics Journal #108 (May 1986), pp. 7‚Äì12.\\"Doran/WaRP Dispute Now Settled,\\" The Comics Journal #110 (August 1986), p. 17.\\"Donning Sues WaRP,\\" The Comics Journal #123 (July 1988), p. 8‚Äì9. The WaRP version of the story has never been reprinted, despite its unusual all-pencil style, although in one collected volume of the new series Doran reprinted the short Distant Soil story \\"R & R\\" that appeared in a WaRP anthology. After leaving WaRP, Doran discarded all 300 pages of work and redid the series from scratch, initially for Starblaze Graphics, the company which first approached Doran for publication rights when she was in high school. Colleen Doran and twelve other creators, including science fiction artist David Cherry and New Age author Mary Summer Rain, sued Donning for copyright violation and fraud.Summer Rain V.

Doran wrote that, once again, she retained all rights to her series, and received a non-disclosed settlement.

The ending of the Cold War necessitated some minor revision to political references in early chapters. She fleshed out earlier scenes and added new ones, as well as a backstory series Seasons of Spring, the story of A Distant Soil's protagonists as children. Doran was a core member of the fledgling self-publishing movement with Cerebus creator Dave Sim, Bone creator Jeff Smith, and Strangers in Paradise creator Terry Moore. They toured the US and Canada under the Spirits of Independence banner, pushing for greater recognition and rights for self publishers.: Colleen Doran ¬ª Remembering the Self Publishing Movement, Jeff Smith Boneville Website In 1996, Doran continued the series at Image Comics, where it is now in multiple printings as a series of trade paperbacks.

It has sold, collectively, more than 700,000 copies.: Colleen Doran ¬ª A Distant Soil website A Distant Soil spawned trading cards, fanzines, pinup books, limited editions, prints and posters, a fan club, and its creator has appeared in numerous documentaries and interviews. It was also optioned for film and television, with interest from Energy Entertainment and David Uslan. The series was on hiatus from 2006 to 2013, after its printer lost the archives of the photographic negatives of the graphic novels.

The museum, which opened in 1939, is located in a former 1920s villa, \\"Villa Philbrook\\", the home of Oklahoma oil pioneer Waite Phillips and his wife Genevieve. Showcasing nine collections of art from all over the world, and spanning various artistic media and styles, the cornerstone collection focuses on Native American art featuring basketry, pottery, paintings and jewelry. History Philbrook Museum of Art Rotunda The Philbrook Art Museum, under the guidance of its first director, Eugene Kingman, opened its doors to the public on October 25, 1939 with a permanent art collection made up of works from the Tulsa Art Association and Villa Philbrook. In 1940, studio art classes were initiated and a touring program for school children the following year that resulted in the addition of a Children's Museum in 1949. A new museum wing was built in 1969 in response to an increased demand for studio art classes, but the use of this space has since changed. The art museum underwent difficult financial times in the 1980s and a renaissance in the 1990s. The name changed from the Philbrook Art Center to The Philbrook Museum of Art in 1987 when it was first accredited. In 2009, after a two-year process, Philbrook was reaccredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), one of 286 art museums and 775 museums overall out of the estimated 17,500 museums in the United States. Santa Fe Room In 1990, the museum was expanded by the addition of the Kravis Wing that included space for a special exhibition gallery, public entry rotunda, museum school, library, a restaurant area that seats up to 100 people, an expanded museum shop and event space. The Williams Conference Center seats 75 to 80 people and the Patti Johnson Wilson Hall, an auditorium performance hall, seats up to 236 people.Philbrook Museum of Art, Green Country, Oklahoma (accessed May 6, 2010). On June 14, 2013, Philbrook opened Philbrook Downtown, a satellite facility in Tulsa's Brady Arts District. With dedicated to modern, contemporary, and Native American art, works on view included pieces by notable 20th-century artists, including Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Clyfford Still, and Georgia O'Keeffe. The upper level of the facility featured the Eugene B. Adkins Collection and the Adkins Study Center. In 2020, the satellite location closed to make way for the Bob Dylan Center. The museum's permanent collection encompasses European, American, Native American, Modern and Contemporary Art and Design, African, Asian and Antiquities. The collection has grown steadily with gifts of American Indian pottery and basketry from Clark Field beginning in 1942 and the Roberta Campbell Lawson collection in 1947. While the American and European collection received a boost from Laura Rutherford Clubb who donated paintings in 1947, and further donations from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1961 of Italian Renaissance paintings and sculptures. The Asian, African, and antiquities collections were enhanced by generous gifts from George H. Taber, Pete and Velma Gillert and Lawrence and Herbert Gussman in the succeeding three decades. Today the collection includes works from Giovanni Bellini, William- Adolphe Bouguereau, William Merritt Chase, Leonardo Drew, Arturo Herrera, Charles Loloma, Maria Martinez, Thomas Moran, Pablo Picasso, Fritz Scholder, Tanzio da Varallo, Rachel Whiteread, Kehinde Wiley, and Andrew Wyeth. The Eugene B.

BuildingVilla Philbrook= Philbrook Museum of Art GalleryVilla Philbrook main facadeGarden view of the villa The original structure of the museum is an Italian Renaissance villa that was the former home of Oklahoma oil pioneer Waite Phillips and his wife Genevieve. Phillips commissioned prominent Kansas City architect Edward Buehler Delk to design the mansion in 1926; construction began the same year by the John Long Company of Kansas City and was completed the following year. Named \\"Villa Philbrook,\\" the three-story mansion was constructed of steel and a reinforced concrete framework that resulted in minimal remodeling being required to transform the villa into an art museum. The exterior of the house is stucco that includes ground white marble in the mixture causing it to glitter. The corners are quoined with Kasota limestone, quarried in Minnesota, that resemble Italian travertine. This stonework also decorates the doors and windows. In the rear of the house, a loggia showcasing five arches with Corinthian columns, highlights a terrace overlooking the formal gardens. The roof features wide eaves and is covered with oversized Italianate tiles. The interior of the mansion featured 72 rooms decorated with travertine and marble fireplaces and fountains, floors of teak, walnut and oak and ornate ceilings reminiscent of Italian villas. The main rooms of the house were found on the ground floor. The mansion is centered by the entrance hall, framed by a double staircase, that flows directly into the receiving hall. The hall is separated by a slightly raised cross-corridor with a groin vaulted ceiling painted with Italian Renaissance designs, further defined by twisted Corinthian columns and ironwork. The main features of the receiving hall are the beams and pierced screenwork that appear to be wood, but are actually painted plaster. Also, a two-manual Aeolian pipe organ can be found behind a large tapestry. Flanking the entrance and receiving halls and accessed by the cross-corridor are the dining room and library to the left and the living and music rooms to the right. The dining and living rooms feature heavily carved coffered ceilings, and the wood paneled library is centered by a globe light fixture that reproduces a map from the time of Leonardo da Vinci. The airy music room is highlighted by a wall mural with bobbed-hair flappers in Grecian garb that illustrates four musical tempos: scherzo, andante, rondo and allegro. In the wing to the right of the main block of the house was a sunroom and to the left was the service wing that included the kitchen and servants quarters. On the second floor was the Phillip's private quarters containing four family bedrooms, each with a bathroom, dressing room and sleeping porch, and two guest rooms. A staircase located between the receiving hall and dining room accessed the lower floor leading to the Southwestern rooms and to the porte- coch√®re. In 1938, the Phillips donated Villa Philbrook and its surrounding gardens to the city of Tulsa, in hopes that the estate would be used for art and cultural purposes.Young, Thomas E., \\"Philbrook Museum of Art ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 6, 2010) While the principal rooms on the first floor were left virtually untouched, the rest of the space has been remodeled for its use as a public institution.Formal gardens Gardens The museum is situated on 25 acres (93,000 m¬≤) of formal and informal gardens. Originally designed by Hare & Hare, the expansive grounds contain elaborate gardens inspired by Villa Lante, an Italian country estate north of Rome designed by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola in 1566. The formal gardens, with its rills and diagonal walks linking the mansion to the rustic pool below, graced with a classical tempietto, are part of the original design and construction. To the south of the property the gardens extending to the summerhouse were conceived later and completed in 2004. They feature native Oklahoma plants and a refurbished creek. The bronze sculpture by Barry Flanagan, Thinker on a Rock, is located in this section. Management , the museum has a staff of 60 and an operating budget of nearly $6 million. During the tenure of director Randall Suffolk between 2007 and 2015, the museum reorganized its curatorial and educational departments to emphasize more family-friendly programming, leading to a 63 percent increase in attendance. Suffolk also sharply increased the museum‚Äôs operating budget and added 2,800 new works to its permanent collection.Randy Kennedy (July 29, 2015), Atlanta‚Äôs High Museum Names New Director: Randall Suffolk New York Times. Suffolk left in 2015 to lead the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. In 2016, Scott Stulen left his role as a curator at the Indianapolis Museum of Art to become the new Philbrook Executive Director.

Labial jets up to high at a sharp angle, another vent bursts up to high, and a related spring splashes high. Following the eruption, Labial continues to have bursts that spray water from the hole, and these rarely lead to a brief but full-force second or even third eruption! Labial Geyser has two satellite geysers (Labial's Satellite Geyser) that react to Labial eruptions but have been seen to act independently as well. Their intervals are not predictable. Full eruptions are 12 to 15 minutes in duration, with the eastern vent dominating. The eastern vent reaches , while the western vent reaches . Minor eruptions, usually originating from the eastern vent, are less than one minute in duration and less energetic than full eruptions.

Compton was launched on 17 September 1944 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. L. Compton; and commissioned on 4 November 1944, Commander R. O. Strange in command. Service history Compton cleared Norfolk 17 February 1945 for training at Pearl Harbor between 16 March and 5 April, when she sailed to escort ships to Kwajalein and Eniwetok. Sailing on to Ulithi, she cleared for Okinawa on 20 April. As the operations there continued, Compton offered gunfire support to forces ashore and served in the antisubmarine and antiaircraft screens protecting shipping off the island. On 12 May she covered the occupation of nearby Tori Shima, and while returning to her station off Okinawa was attacked by a lone Japanese plane which she splashed. After repairs at Leyte from 17 May to 16 June 1945, Compton returned to Okinawa for continued operations until 4 July, when she sailed to escort a convoy to Guam, returning to Leyte Gulf on 10 July. For the remainder of the month, she screened ships training in the Gulf, then returned to Okinawa, where she lay at anchor in Buckner Bay until 25 August. =1945-1968= Sent then to carry mail to the 3rd Fleet at sea, Compton entered Sagami Wan on 28 August 1945. On 25 August 1945 Compton got underway to deliver operational orders and intelligence material to ships of the 3rd Fleet operating off the entrance to Tokyo Bay. Two days later while passing mail to the battleship , she collided with the starboard side of Idaho, damaging several of her frames and plates and suffering small punctures to her side. She entered Sagami Wan to await the destroyer tender . The tender arrived but before repairs could be begin both ships were ordered into Tokyo Bay. On 29 August 1945 Compton entered Tokyo Bay and became the only fifth fleet ship to enter Tokyo Bay prior to the formal surrender. For the next six months, she served on patrol in the western Pacific, and acted as planeguard while air organizations were redistributed throughout the Far East. She cleared Yokosuka on 21 February 1946 for San Pedro, California, arriving on 15 March. Two weeks later she sailed to join the Atlantic Fleet, raising Portland, Maine on 16 April. After overhaul, she operated along the northeast coast and in the Caribbean until 3 February 1947, when she sailed for her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean. Compton returned to her home port, Newport, Rhode Island on 14 August 1947. Along with east coast operations, Compton cruised the Caribbean on intensive training and midshipmen cruises in the years that followed, as well as serving as schoolship and training members of the Navy Reserve. During her 1948-49 deployment to the Mediterranean, she had duty with the United Nations Palestine Patrol. She returned to the Mediterranean in 1951, and in the late summer of 1952 cruised in European waters in NATO \\"Operation Mainbrace.\\" Assignment to duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean came once more in 1953 and 1955, and in the spring of 1956, Compton exercised off Bermuda with ships of the British Home Fleet in NATO operation \\"New Broom V.\\" During the summer of 1953, Compton was the flagship of Destroyer Squadron 8, and along with two cruisers, spent six weeks touring the Caribbean on a midshipman cruise carrying contract (reserve) midshipmen from universities around the country. The fleet of ten ships sailed from Norfolk and called at Coca Sola, Panama, Port of Spain, Trinidad, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and back to Norfolk. Compton was serving at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf in the fall of 1956 when the Suez Crisis erupted, and stood by to evacuate American civilians in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas should that become necessary. With the Suez Canal closed, Compton made her homeward passage by way of Mombasa, Durban, the Cape of Good Hope, Simonstown, Recife, and Trinidad, returning to Newport on 8 January 1957. That fall, she again cruised off the British Isles in a series of NATO operations. From November 1957 to April 1958, she again served in the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, and that summer cruised to Rotterdam and Bergen with midshipmen on board for training. From that time into 1960, her operations were coastwise and in the Caribbean, as she aided research and development projects, including major meteorological research and gave service to the Fleet Sonar School at Key West. In August 1960 Compton again sailed to the Mediterranean for duty in the 6th Fleet. : [1960-1968] 1968-1972 During 1968-9, Compton served in the 1st Naval District (headquartered at Boston, Massachusetts) as a Naval Reserve training ship. She provided Naval Reserve enlistees in their first year of service at the ranks of seaman, seaman apprentice, and seaman recruit with a two-week training cruise. The reserve cruises supplemented the \\"boot camp\\" training which was conducted at Great Lakes, Great Lakes, Illinois. The ships routine for the cruises was to leave Boston, rendezvous with another destroyer and a submarine off the New England coast, perform anti-submarine warfare exercises, and proceed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, for a brief \\"liberty\\", where the Canadian Navy would host sailors from Compton in its enlisted club. During these cruises, enlistees were given the opportunity to experience shipboard life, including firing the weapon systems such as Hedgehog (weapon)Hedgehog, depth charges, and guns. : [1969-1972] Decommissioning Compton was decommissioned on 17 September 1972. She was stricken from the Navy List on 27 September 1972. Brazilian Navy service Compton was transferred to Brazil on 27 September 1972. She served in the Brazilian Navy under the name Mato Grosso. Mato Grosso was stricken in July 1990 and scrapped. Honors and awards Compton received one battle star for World War II service.

Etymology The word \\"L√°ny\\" in Czech means \\"fields\\" or \\"tracts (of land)\\". History Until 1918, the village was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Schlan (Slan√Ω) district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften (district office) in Bohemia.

There is also a sports car museum and Museum of T. G. Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia. Both President Masaryk and his wife are buried in the local cemetery. =L√°ny Castle= The castle of L√°ny was first mentioned in 1392. It changed owners many times and underwent a major reconstruction in 1902‚Äì1903. In 1921, it was purchased by the Czechoslovak state and designated as an official summer presidential residence. Slovene architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik was commissioned to make improvements both to the castle and the adjacent park. T. G. Masaryk, the first President, liked the castle and was allowed to stay there after his abdication in 1935 until his death in 1937.

William Clyde Hitchcock (July 31, 1916 ‚Äì April 9, 2006) was an American professional baseball infielder, coach, manager and scout. In Major League Baseball (MLB), he was primarily a third baseman, second baseman and shortstop who appeared in 703 games over nine years with five American League teams. After 18 years as a coach, manager (of the Baltimore Orioles and Atlanta Braves), and scout he became an executive in Minor League Baseball, serving as president of the Double-A Southern League from 1971‚Äì80. His older brother, Jimmy Hitchcock, played briefly for the 1938 Boston Braves. Playing career Born in Inverness, Alabama and a graduate of Auburn University, Hitchcock played all four infield positions during a nine- year American League active career. The right-handed batter and thrower stood tall and weighed . He broke in with the Detroit Tigers, spent three years in the Army Air Force in the Pacific during World War II, and resumed his Major League career from 1946 to 1953. Overall, he batted .243 with 547 hits and five home runs in 703 games with the Tigers, Washington Senators, Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Browns, and Philadelphia Athletics. Managerial career Between Triple-A managing assignments in 1954 and 1961, Hitchcock served a six-year (1955‚Äì60) term as the Tigers' third base coach. He also became a footnote to one of the most bizarre personnel transactions in baseball annals. On August 3, 1960, the Tigers and Cleveland Indians traded their managers, Jimmy Dykes for Joe Gordon. Hitchcock served as Detroit's interim skipper for one game while Gordon was en route from his Cleveland assignment, and the Tigers defeated the New York Yankees, 12‚Äì2, on August 3 at Yankee Stadium.Retrosheet In , Hitchcock was named the full-time manager of the Baltimore Orioles. But in his two seasons at the helm, the ballclub barely broke the .500 mark (163‚Äì161). Hitchcock was dismissed on September 29 after the final game of the 1963 campaign in which the fourth-place Orioles finished games behind the Yankees,\\"Orioles Fire Bill Hitchcock as Manager\\" Associated Press, Sunday, September 29, 1963 and moved into Baltimore's minor league department as field coordinator. Then he became a scout for the Braves, whose general manager at the time was former Tiger player and executive John McHale. Hitchcock began the season as a coach for the Atlanta Braves under Bobby Bragan during the club's first season in Atlanta. But when the Braves won only 52 of their first 111 games, Bragan was fired on August 9 and Hitchcock took over. The Braves won 33 of their last 51 games to finish fifth in the National League, and Hitchcock was invited back for , but he was fired September 28 of that year with the team in seventh place and three games remaining on the schedule.Braves fire Bill Hitchcock as manager His career managing record was 274 wins, 261 losses (.514). Hitchcock then scouted for McHale and the Montreal Expos in 1968‚Äì71 before taking over as president of the Southern League. Southern League presidency Hitchcock became president of the Southern League in August 1971. During his presidency, the league added new teams, expanded its playoffs, and introduced split-season play. Other improvements included stadium refurbishments and efforts to make the league more family-friendly. Attendance figures rose dramatically during his tenure, from 333,500 in 1971 to over 1.7 million in 1980. The Southern League championship trophy is named after Hitchcock, and in 1980 he was presented with the King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. He stepped down from the presidency in 1980. College athletics In addition to his baseball resume, Hitchcock also made a name for himself in college football and golf. As an All-Conference tailback, he led Auburn to its first bowl game (a 7-7 tie against Villanova on January 1, 1937). Later in life, he established the Billy Hitchcock Golf Tournament at his alma mater. In recognition of his contribution to the school, Auburn renamed its renovated baseball stadium \\"Hitchcock Field\\" in 2003. Also in that year, Baseball America named it the best college baseball facility in the country.

In his career, Gardner also came in the top 10 in hit by pitches twice (1956 and 1957), with a career-high of 8 in 1957 (fifth in the league). He wound up as a utility infielder with 1961 Yankees, winning the 1961 World Series with them against the Cincinnati Reds. In his one and only at bat of the post- season, he lined out to shortstop in the ninth inning of Game 2. The Yankees lost the game 6‚Äì2. Gardner ended his career with two years on the Red Sox, picking up 70 hits with them in 283 at bats. Nicknamed \\"Shotgun\\" for his rifle arm,Ellis, Jim, This Shotgun Protects the Birds, Baseball Digest, June 1958, pp. 25‚Äì29 Gardner led American League second basemen in fielding percentage in 1957 (.987), including 55 consecutive errorless games, and finished with a .976 fielding mark all-time. In all or parts of ten seasons, Gardner batted .237 with 41 home runs and 271 RBIs in 1034 games played. He picked up 841 hits, with 159 doubles and 18 triples in 3544 career at bats. He finished with 19 career steals. As a manager and coach After finishing his career with the Red Sox, Gardner stayed in the Boston organization for eight more seasons as a minor league coach and manager (1964; 1967‚Äì71) and Major League third- base coach (1965‚Äì66). He then managed in the Kansas City Royals farm system from 1972 to 1976, coached at first base for the Montreal Expos in 1977‚Äì78, and was a skipper in the Montreal farm system in 1979‚Äì80. Gardner rejoined the Twins as a third-base coach for the 1981 season. He was promoted to manager on May 23, 1981, replacing Johnny Goryl, and served until June 21, 1985, never leading Minnesota to the playoffs and avoiding a losing record only once (1984, at 81‚Äì81). Gardner incorporated young players such as Kent Hrbek, Kirby Puckett, Frank Viola and Tim Laudner into the Twin lineup, beginning the foundation of the club's two World Series clubs to come. After a 268‚Äì353 record with Minnesota, Gardner received a second chance to manage with the 1987 Royals. Gardner initially signed as the Royals' 1987 third-base coach, but terminally ill Royals manager Dick Howser, diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor during the summer of 1986, was forced to retire during spring training, and Gardner was promoted to fill the vacancy. He was fired on August 28 of that year after going 62‚Äì64, and John Wathan took over. His career record as a manager was 330‚Äì417, a .442 winning percentage. Family Gardner's son, Billy Jr., a former minor league infielder, is a manager in the Washington Nationals' organization, named to helm the 2020 Harrisburg Senators. Gardner Jr. was the Nationals' minor league coordinator in 2018 and 2019; previously, from 2014 to 2017, he was the skipper of the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League, the Nationals' Triple-A affiliate.

He has earned the nickname Polle Pap, a name he inherited from a childhood job as a milkman in his hometown of Heist-op-den-Berg, where he was born. Paul started out with a small band called Purple Bus. From 1974 until 1980, he played keyboards for a British-Belgian band called Octopus. After Octopus broke up, Paul then went solo under the name P.P. Michiels. Under that name, he became famous in his home country for a single titled \\"Females,\\" which notoriously became popular because it was accompanied by a seducing music video. In 1986, Paul teamed up with Belgian singer Jan Leyers to form the group The Soul Sisters. They released three very popular singles: \\"You Get to Me,\\" \\"Talk About It\\" and \\"Like a Mountain.\\" In 1988, they changed their name to Soulsister and hit it big time with the soulful, Motown-sounding song \\"The Way to Your Heart\\" on their first album, It Takes Two. The band changed their name again in 1990, this time to Leyers, Michiels, and SoulSister, and released Heat. They released two more studio albums and a live album, and released a \\"Very Best Of\\" compilation in 1997 following their split. After splitting away, Paul returned to his solo career. In 1998, he released The Inner Child, which included the hit \\"One Day at a Time.\\" In 2001, Paul released a personal compilation titled Forever Young, which included the title song by Alphaville (which Paul sang for the 2000 Belgian movie Team Spirit) as well as pieces by Eddie Cochran, Jacques Dutronc, Donovan, Dionne Warwick, The Wallace Collection, Easybeats, Eddie Floyd, and other artists from Europe and North America. Paul refrained from releasing another album too soon, but stayed on tour with the \\"Big M's,\\" the name of his band. In 2006, he released a third solo album, Magic in the House. The album featured the singles \\"If I Live, If I Breathe\\" and \\"The Light,\\" the latter being released as both a standard and instrumental piece.

He is the developer of a customer satisfaction model (now known as the Kano model) whose simple ranking scheme distinguishes between essential and differentiating attributes related to concepts of customer quality. He is a professor emeritus of the Tokyo University of Science. He was Visiting Professor at the University of Rome III during the academic year 2010-2011. Contributions to quality In the late 1970s and early 1980s Kano and his colleagues laid the foundation for a new approach to modeling customer satisfaction. Kano challenged the conventional beliefs that improving each attribute of a company's product or service will lead to increased customer satisfaction. Kano believed that not all attributes of product or service performance are equal in the eyes of the customer, and that some attributes create higher levels of customer loyalty than others. One of his well-known books is the Guide to TQM in Service Industries. Academic achievements, awards and honors Noriaki Kano completed his undergraduate, masters, and doctoral degrees in the engineering school of the University of Tokyo. He retired from the Tokyo University of Science (TUS) after 35 years in research and education, as a lecturer and associate professor at the University of Electro-Communications and a full professor and head of the Department of Management Science at TUS. He was the 1997 recipient of the Deming Prize for Individuals, administered by the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE). In 1997 he also received the Deming Lecturer Award of the American Statistical Association; his paper for the annual Deming Lecture was titled \\"Business Strategies for the 21st Century and Attractive Quality Creation.\\" Kano is the only honorary member of three societies i.e. International Academy for Quality (IAQ), American Society for Quality (ASQ) and Japan Society for Quality Control (JSQC). He was the recipient of two ASQ Medals of Distinction: the E. Jack Lancaster Medal for 2002 and the E. L. Grant Medal for 2007. Kano is a recipient of the Georges Borel Award for international contribution by the European Organization for Quality (EOQ). Kano is the Honorary Chairperson of Asian Network for Quality (ANQ).

Introduced at the 1965 Tokyo Motor Show, the S800 would replace the successful Honda S600 as the company's image car and would compete with the Austin-Healey Sprite, MG Midget, Triumph Spitfire and Fiat 850 Spider. History Like the S600, it was available as either a coupe or roadster and continued the advanced technology of its predecessors. The 791 cc straight-4 engine produced 70 hp (52 kW) at 8000 rpm, thus making this Honda's first 100 mph (160 km/h) automobile, but still allowing for 35 mpg (6.7 L/100 km). In April 1967 the car was described as the fastest production 1-litre car in the world thanks to its high revving engine (up to 10,000 rpm) and the manufacturer's history of manufacturing powerful relatively low capacity motor-cycle engines. Honda S800 RSC Racecar. Honda S800 display at Honda Collection Hall in Motegi Early examples continued to use the chain drive and independent suspension in the rear. 752 roadsters and 242 coup√©s were then produced. After that Honda switched to a conventional drive-shaft, live axle rear end with four radius rods and a Panhard rod.Buckley, Martin.The Illustrated Book of Classic Cars. Anness Publishing Ltd, 1997, 2003, p. 146-7. 604 roadsters and 69 coupes were built with this setup before disc brakes replaced the front drums. In 1967, the S800 became available in Britain. By this time the model had the more conventional drive layout as stated above, with predictable handling and a firm ride. It was also cheaper than the Mini Cooper and Triumph Spitfire, in Britain. In February 1968, the S800M (aka S800MK2) was introduced with flush mounted interior door handles, side marker lights outside, dual-circuit brakes, lean burn carburetion under the bonnet and safety glass. These changes were made for the American market, but the car was never exported there officially. Production ended in May 1970 with 11,536 S800s produced. Honda did not manufacture another S roadster for nearly thirty years until the release of the S2000 for the 2000 model year.

The Happy Goodmans achieved significant popularity in the 1960s. In 1968, they won the first Grammy Award to be awarded for a gospel album by a gospel group. History The Happy Goodman Family began to be known for their singing around 1950. During the 1940s and 1950s, there were various combinations of all eight brothers and sisters, always including Howard. Sam served in the U.S. Air Force while Bobby worked as a truck driver and played some rock and roll bands. Rusty served in the armed forces as well as singing with The Plainsmen Quartet afterwards. Howard's wife Vestal joined the group as well. After all the sisters married, Howard and Vestal became evangelists. Soon Sam joined again followed by Rusty in 1962 and Bobby on bass guitar not long afterwards. The fame of the Happy Goodmans grew considerably in the early 1960s. Appearances at the National Quartet Convention got them in front of promoters who in turn booked them across the country. In 1964, they were asked to become one of the flagship groups for a new Southern Gospel program called The Gospel Singing Jubilee along with The Florida Boys, Dixie Echoes, and The Couriers Quartet. This program soon became one of the most popular gospel music programs and would run for over twenty years. The Goodmans would soon become one of the most popular groups on the program, and would remain so for ten years till they left to start their own TV program, The Happy Goodman Family Hour. The Goodmans also had a short-lived program called Down Home with The Happy Goodman Family. The weekly TV exposure allowed The Happy Goodman Family to take the nation by storm. They quickly became America's favorite singing family. Their first full-length recording was I'm Too Near Home, initially released in 1963 and later re-released on Canaan/Word Records in 1965. The Goodmans had a long list of hit songs. Many of the songs they introduced to gospel music are now considered classics. Songs such as \\"I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now\\", \\"Who Am I?\\", \\"God Walks the Dark Hills\\", \\"Had It Not Been\\", \\"What a Beautiful Day\\", and many others will forever be part of gospel music and synonymous with the Happy Goodman Family. The Goodmans broke new ground in gospel music during the 1960s and 1970s by implementing a live band and creating their own unique sound. It was during these years that they developed their now classic \\"grab a note and hang on\\" endings. Sam's humorous emcee work, Howard's showmanship at the piano, Rusty's songwriting, and Vestal's hairdos, white handkerchiefs, and powerful singing voice all rose to a new prominence. Tenor Johnny Cook joined the group for a while in 1974 and Rusty's daughter Tanya was added in 1976. =Separate paths= Around 1980, creative differences about musical style caused a division in the family. The musical landscape of Christian music was expanding considerably at this time, and Howard and Vestal wanted to maintain their traditional sound. Rusty, Sam, and Tanya wanted to take the group in a more contemporary direction. Ultimately, Howard and Vestal decided to leave the group, after making what would become one of their best albums. Rusty, Sam, and Tanya carried on with Johnny Cook returning at tenor. Michael English joined them a couple of years later singing lead. Michael left The Goodmans, a short time after joining, to sing with The Singing Americans. =Reunion= The Goodmans Greatest Hits from 1985, with Sam, Vestal, Howard, and Rusty Aside from a one-time performance at the 1984 National Quartet Convention by Sam, Rusty, Howard, and Vestal, the Happy Goodmans did not sing together from 1984 to 1990. Shortly after the breakup, a compilation album, The Goodmans Greatest Hits made by Sam, Rusty, Vestal, and Howard was released in 1985, with the quartet pictured on the cover. It has more recently been re-mastered and re-released on Compact Disc. In 1990, news that Rusty had been diagnosed with cancer prompted the family to record a project together called \\"The Reunion\\". Although they initially planned to tour in support of the project, Rusty's health deteriorated rapidly. He died in November 1990. Sam followed his brother in death the next year. This album features the last song Rusty wrote, Standing in the Presence of the King, a fitting end to his songwriting career. =Howard and Vestal's Final Stand with Johnny Minick= In 1993, Howard and Vestal were joined on vocals by former Happy Goodman band member Johnny Minick. As a trio, they brought back the Happy Goodman name to the delight of fans. Several projects were released over the next five years and they were regular fixtures at Gaither Homecoming events. Their last project was appropriately titled \\"The Final Stand (2001)\\". In 2002, a biographical video titled More Than The Music...Life Story chronicled the history of the Happy Goodmans. It is preceded by O Happy Day, a biography written by Jamie Buckingham (1973). O Happy Day is an early telling of the Happy Goodman Family in stories recalled by Howard. Vestal wrote her autobiography titled \\"Vestal! Lord I Wouldn't Take Nothin' for My Journey Now\\"(1999) and released a number of solo projects before her death in 2003, including two \\"Vestal and Friends\\" CDs featuring duets with a diverse array of vocalists, including George Jones, Sandi Patty, Dolly Parton, Andra√© Crouch, Wynonna Judd, Bill and Gloria Gaither, Newsboys and the love of her life, Howard Goodman. In her final years, she also appeared regularly on Bill Gaither's Precious Memories television series. The group recorded 15 number-one singles and played over 3,500 shows. They were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.  Awards  In 1968, The Goodmans won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance for the 1967 album The Happy Gospel of the Happy Goodmans. It was the first Grammy awarded for a gospel album by a gospel group. The Goodmans also won the same award in 1978 (only then called Best Gospel Performance, Traditional) for Refreshing. In 1969, with the founding of the Gospel Music Association and the GMA's Dove Awards, the Goodmans were honored that year too. Vestal was the first Female Vocalist of the Year for the 1969 Dove Awards. The Goodmans were remembered year after year when it came time to nominate for awards.

The group, all siblings, consisted of guitarist Benny DeFranco (born 11 July 1953); keyboardist Marisa DeFranco (born 23 July 1954); guitarist Nino DeFranco (born 19 October 1955); drummer Merlina DeFranco (born 20 July 1957); and lead singer Tony DeFranco (born 31 August 1959). The group had a number of hits between 1973 and 1977, including \\"Abra-Ca-Dabra\\" and their biggest hit, \\"Heartbeat - It's a Lovebeat.\\" Either Tony DeFranco or the entire family made frequent appearances in the teen magazines of this period, such as Tiger Beat and Flip. By the late 1970s, the group had faded from the pop scene. Biography The five siblings who comprised the DeFranco Family were born to Italian immigrant parents and raised in Port Colborne and Welland, Ontario. Initially performing as the DeFranco Quintet, the group found success after a demo tape of their songs was heard by Sharon Lee, editor of teen magazine Tiger Beat. Impressed by what she heard, Lee arranged for Charles Laufer to fly the group to Los Angeles for an audition. Laufer signed the group to an exclusive deal with his company, Laufer Entertainment, financed a three-song demo, and helped them to secure a contract with 20th Century Records. The DeFranco Family recorded at United Western Recorders studios in Hollywood with accompaniment by Wrecking Crew veterans Hal Blaine on drums, Larry Carlton on guitar, and Max Bennett on bass. They appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand nine times. With their lighthearted approach to music, the DeFranco Family became a successful pop music act in the mid-1970s. They benefited from two major factors: the imposition of Canadian content regulations that encouraged Canadian radio stations to broadcast songs by artists from their home country, and the early 1970s popularity of two other family quintets often led by preteens, The Osmonds and The Jackson 5. The DeFranco Family's debut 1973 single, \\"Heartbeat - It's a Lovebeat,\\" featuring the lead vocals of then 13-year-old Tony DeFranco, reached number one on WLS for five straight weeks (and was number two there for the entire year 1973), number three in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the top slot on the Cashbox singles chart, as well as hitting number three in their native Canada on the RPM 100 national Top Singles chart, selling more than two million copies in the process. It was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A in November 1973. The song's writer, Purdue alumnus Michael T. Kennedy, was a long-time executive at Boeing/McDonnell Douglas. Their second single, \\"Abra-Ca-Dabra,\\" which reached the Top 40, was followed by their final hit, \\"Save the Last Dance for Me,\\" which reached number 18 on the charts in May 1974. Much of their success in 1973 came at the expense of the Osmonds, who (themselves making an attempt at proselytizing with their music that year) declined in popularity for that year, though they would slightly recover in 1974. The DeFranco Family's active career reached a roadblock after that point. Family quintets were beginning to fall out of favor in the mid-1970s as disco began ascending (the Osmonds similarly saw a drop in popularity at the same time, while the Jackson 5 quickly adapted to disco), which coincided with Tony's voice changing because of puberty. A rock version of their tune \\"Write Me a Letter\\" failed to generate much attention and reached no higher than the 104th slot on the charts. Although their earlier hits had been produced by Walt Meskell, the disappointing sales of \\"Write Me a Letter\\" prompted their record label, 20th Century Records, to dismiss Meskell involuntarily and team the group with Mike Curb, who had previously worked with The Osmonds. But the collaboration proved disastrous. When Curb attempted to recast the group as a cover band, they resisted and severed their relationship with their publisher and manager, Charles Laufer and Laufer Entertainment, and 20th Century Records. Unable to attract interest from another label, they continued to tour and perform in Las Vegas until they ceased performing in 1978. A reunion concert at Rhino Records' Retro Fest in August 1999 was followed by the DeFranco Family's final performance at B.B. King's Nightclub in Los Angeles in April 2000. The siblings took up residences in California within an hour's drive from each other and remain close. Although the DeFranco Family gave up its involvement in the music industry, Tony and Marisa continue to perform on occasion.

History During the 1880s, members of the Hague Party named Narcissus Geyser. In Greek mythology, Narcissus was renowned for his beauty. He was overly prideful, and disdained those who loved him. As divine punishment he fell in love with his own reflection in a pool, not realizing it was merely an image. He wasted away to death, being unable to leave that which he loved. Eruptions Narcissus Geyser has minor and major eruptions. Minor eruptions last 5 to 8 minutes and are high. Major eruptions last up to 15 minutes and are high. The interval between eruptions is and 6 hours. This geyser is the hardest to see in the Pink Cone Group as it is located furthest from the road and is partially screened by trees. Its cone is the same pink color as Pink and Pink Cone Geysers indicating that they may be tied together though they do not seem to interact.

The third way one gets an equity card is through the \\"Equity Membership Candidate Program\\" (EMC). In this program, actors are allowed to work in Equity productions as credit towards eventual membership. An actor is eligible for membership once he completes fifty weeks of work at theatres that are a part of the EMC program. Once a member, the actor is required to pay \\"yearly dues\\" of $118 plus \\"working dues\\" which are 2.25% of the gross earnings through an equity contract. =Member benefits and privileges= The first major benefit to having an Equity card, as an actor, is that many professional auditions are Equity-only calls. Non- members are allowed to attend, but with no guarantee of being seen. Equity members are allowed to attend these Equity-only calls without these restrictions. Contract benefits for members include minimum wages, work rules such as length of work day, health insurance, pension, and workers' compensation insurance. Once an individual is a member of Actor's Equity, they may not rehearse or perform in a non-equity production without written permission from Equity. The rule does not apply to children under the age of 14, who may temporarily withdraw membership in order to perform in a non- equity production such as a school play.

Shannon has been a Cardinals radio broadcaster since 1972. Shannon was raised in St. Louis, Missouri and was an integral part of some of the Cards‚Äô most successful seasons, during the 1960s. He was the proprietor of Mike Shannon's Steaks and Seafood restaurant, in downtown St. Louis, until its closing, on January 30, 2016. Shannon still operates two Mike Shannon's Grill locations, in Edwardsville, IL, and at the St. Louis Lambert International Airport, which is run by his grandson, Justin VanMatre.Mike Shannon's restaurant downtown to close Jan. 30 Early life Shannon was born and raised in south St. Louis at 7045 Winona Avenue. Mike was the second oldest of six children of Thomas A. Shannon and Elizabeth W. Richason Shannon. Shannon's father was a St. Louis police officer and after getting his law degree, worked in the Prosecuting Attorney's office before becoming the Prosecuting Attorney for the City of St. Louis in the early 1970s. Shannon attended grade school at Epiphany of Our Lord Catholic School, and graduated from Christian Brothers College High School in 1957. While at CBC Shannon was the Missouri High School Player of the Year in both football and basketball his senior year. He is the only athlete to win both awards in the same year. He attended the University of Missouri before leaving in 1958 to begin his professional baseball career after signing with Bing Devine, GM of the St. Louis Cardinals. Shannon has commented that if football players were paid better during his era, he probably would have stayed at Missouri and sought a professional football career. He believed himself to be a better football player. His former coach Frank Broyles commented that had he stayed in school, Shannon might have won the Heisman Trophy. Playing career Shannon began his big league career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1962. In 1964, he became the team's regular right fielder, shifting to third base (in order to make room for the newly acquired Roger Maris) in 1967. Shannon played in three World Series for the Cardinals. He hit a game-tying two-run homer off Whitey Ford in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series against the New York Yankees, which St. Louis won 9-5. One of his best years came in 1966, when he batted .288 in 137 games with 16 home runs and 64 RBI. He was named NL Player of the Month in July (.395, 7 HR, 23 RBI). He posted another excellent season in 1968, when he batted .266 in 156 games, with 15 home runs and 79 RBI; these numbers would in most seasons be considered average at best, but in the \\"Year of the Pitcher\\", such stats were enough to earn him seventh place in MVP voting, behind teammates Bob Gibson, Curt Flood, and Lou Brock, as well as Giants Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal, and Pete Rose of the Reds. In Game 3 of the 1967 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Shannon hit a key home run off Gary Bell. In Game 7 of the 1968 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Shannon's solo home run off Mickey Lolich was the Cardinals' only run off Lolich as the Tigers clinched. Shannon also hit the last home run in the original Busch Stadium (Sportsman's Park) in 1966 and the first one for the Cardinals in the second Busch Stadium (Busch Memorial Stadium). In 1970, he contracted nephritis, a kidney disease, which ended his playing career. Broadcasting career Shannon Cardinal Hall of Fame speech in 2014. James \\"Cool Papa\\" Bell in 1986. Shannon joined the Cardinals' promotional staff in 1971; a year later he moved to the team's radio booth. For almost three decades Shannon was paired with Hall of Fame announcer Jack Buck on AM 1120 KMOX and the Cardinals Radio Network. Following Buck's death in 2002, he was named the team's lead radio voice, teaming with Joel Meyers (2002), Wayne Hagin (2003‚Äì2005), and John Rooney (2006‚Äìpresent). In 2006, he moved to KTRS (550) which had won broadcasting rights for the Cardinals and ownership of the station. For the 2011 season KMOX regained the rights for Cardinals broadcasting and Shannon returned to his former employer. Shannon received a local Emmy Award for his work on Cardinal broadcasts in 1985, and was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. He was named Missouri Sportscaster of the Year in 2002 and 2003. On Friday nights after a Cardinals home game, Shannon traditionally hosts a sports chat show from the Cardinals' home radio booth. Shannon's signature home run call is \\"Here's a long one to left/center/right, get up baby, get up, get up...oh yeah!\\" During the 1980s, Shannon worked as a backup analyst (behind the main analysts, Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek) for NBC's Game of the Week telecasts (typically working with play-by-play man Jay Randolph). Counting his tenure in the minor leagues, Shannon has spent 61 years‚Äînearly his entire adult life‚Äîwith the Cardinals in some capacity. He has also called Cardinals games longer than anyone except Buck. On August 8, 2014 Shannon was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame. As of the 2016 season, Shannon only calls home games for the Cardinals.

The title began as a weekly pop music parody strip by Kev F Sutherland and Russ Carvell in the music paper Sounds, running from 1987 until Sounds final issue in 1991. When Sutherland got the chance to create a new humour magazine in September 1991 he revived the strip's name, with Carvell drawing the covers and lead movie parody strips. Edited by Sutherland, UT was one of many comics emulating the success of Viz; however it attempted to engage the quality end of the market, with a variety of strips by talented and established cartoonists, TV satires, and supposedly intelligent (for the genre) subject matter. However, in order to obtain financial backing, it required to be published by Sport Newspapers, who also publish the semi-pornographical tabloid Sunday Sport - as a result, UT featured a large number of pornographic adverts and Sport branding in some contrast to its content. A recurring theme throughout the comic was a fictionalised version of Sutherland battling with a stereotypical pornographer, a fat, balding lech constantly trying to add salacious content to the strips. UT was published from late 1991 to early 1993, and included two reprint specials. Its sister titles Gag, Kack and Bloody Hell ran for only a few more months. The name UT, chosen by Sutherland for the musical parody strip, came from the original first word of the tonic scale as taught to Victorian schoolchildren, i.e. \\"Ut-re-me-fa-so-la-te-do\\" which later became \\"Do-re-mi\\". UT Productions Ltd is the name of the company of which Sutherland is a director. Strips included: * Arthur Pilkington - a Conan the Barbarian lampoon involving accountants. Written and drawn by David Leach, the strip had first appeared in Gas magazine. * Blunderbirds - a satire of ThunderBirds * Fat Frank (of the Taxi Rank) - a taxi driver * Rainbro - Rainbow with Zippy as a foul-mouthed bully. * Special Agent Smegg - one of an interlocking set of strips involving the pupils in a public school in the 1960s through to modern times. Described as \\"a James Bond parody with knob gags.\\" * Thud and Bud - a pair of ineffectual nightclub bouncers Irwin Allen's TRAIN!- a spoof of disaster movies which incorporated satire on the state of Britain's railway network and poor excuses for late trains in its narrative.

Prior to the mid 18th century, most farmers in England rotated their crops across three or four strips of land- see Crop rotation, and ‚Äòrights of common‚Äô- see common land were claimed for grazing the unfenced land. The Inclosures Acts of the 19th century proposed the inclosure of Elmstone-Hardwicke in 1899. However, many fields remained unfenced until 1918, which villagers believe make it the last village in England to be inclosed. Following the Inclosure, many poor farmers lost their common grazing rights, so in Elmstone-Hardwicke, a plot was set aside as a recreation ground for grazing of their animals, and a further for allotments.British History Online (http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383&strquery;=elmstone- hardwicke) Accessed on 17/2/10 These fields still exist, and although none of the current residents graze or cultivate the land as individuals, the Parish Council leases the land to a local farmer, and the money is reinvested into the community.

It was created and written by Reg Watson and produced by Reg Grundy Productions. Synopsis Dangerous Women was loosely based on the 1979 Australian series Prisoner which had enjoyed success in syndication on many networks around the US from late 1979 to around mid 1982. With both series created by Reg Watson, Dangerous Women initially shared many similarities with its Australian counterpart, although this became far less apparent as the series continued. The characters in Dangerous Women were based on the original characters of Prisoner: The characters of Karen Travers and Lynne Warner from the latter became Maria Trent and Holly Warner in Dangerous Women and both of their opening storylines were based on those originally shown in Prisoner. Similarly, Rita Jones's personality was based on Bea Smith, Crystal Fox shared the characteristics of nymphomaniac Marilyn Mason, and Cissie Johnson was based on the character 'Mum' Brooks - Cissie's daughter rejected her just as Mum's daughter disowned her when she was released in Prisoner. Although many characters and storylines were clearly borrowed from Prisoner, the main character who tied the show together was Faith Cronin (Valerie Wildman), a mobster's wife. This character and storyline was unique and created especially for the new version of the series. Faith had been seriously disfigured by her mobster husband, and on leaving prison, she framed her ex-husband for murder after she staged her own death. Faith then had plastic surgery and created a new identity, becoming the confident and glamorous Patricia Meadows. She bought a lakefront inn, The Cedar Lake Inn, a destination she'd loved as a child and somewhere she'd always dreamed of living once she was released from prison - only to find her past catching up with her when one by one, her fellow former convicts converge on the Cedar Lake area as they are released from prison. As the series progressed, the prison angle was gradually phased out as all of the characters had been released. They eventually took refuge at the Inn and attempted to rebuild their lives together. CastAirings and cancelation Dangerous Women premiered August 7, 1991 and aired only one season. The show was syndicated on a limited basis ‚Äì WWOR-TV in New York City, WPWR-TV in Chicago and KCOP in Los Angeles were known to have carried the program. WDCA in Washington, D.C. carried the program but soon relegated it to a 2 AM time slot. In some markets, two one-hour episodes aired back to back every Wednesday night with encores on Saturday nights. It had reasonable ratings in New York, but it wasn't enough to keep the show going. It was pulled from syndication on January 1, 1992 after 52 episodes. Several weeks before the show was officially canceled, all six lead actresses appeared on The Richard Bey Show, a talk show that originated from WWOR. The cast also appeared on two episodes of NY At Night, a primetime talk show on WWOR starring entertainer Clint Holmes. These appearances were their last attempt to keep the show on the air. UK transmission  Shortly after its American cancellation, the show was broadcast on Central Television ‚Äì the ITV franchise for the United Kingdom's English Midlands. It aired on Sunday and Monday nights from March 1992 replacing Prisoner in the schedule (which had finished December the previous year). All 52 episodes aired. No other ITV regions broadcast the series. The show was also later aired twice by cable TV station Living, in a late-night time-slot and repeated weekdays.

It is the capital of both the Cabana District and the Province of Pallasca in the Ancash Region of northern Peru. Cabana was founded on January 2, 1857, although human habitation there likely predates arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors. The city is divided into four neighborhoods: *Huayumaca *Pacchamaca *San Jer√≥nimo *Trujillo Cabana is the birthplace of former President Alejandro Toledo. History Cabana was founded in 1711 with the name of \\"Caguana\\" which means \\"To repair\\" or \\"to contemplate\\" in the Cully Language (former language of this region)according to an old legend. When the Spanish conquerors arrived to Caguana, the name was mispronounced and started to say \\"Cabana\\" instead of Caguana. Cabana was officially created by the Provisional Regulations on February 12, 1821 and then comprised to the vast province of Conchucos. Cabana was elevated to the level of district on December 2, 1856 under the Presidency of Don Don Ram√≥n Castilla. Then in 1861 the province of Conchucos was divided into two provinces: Pallasca and Pomabamba, the first with its capital Corongo and the second with its capital Pomabamba. On October 30, 1901, Cabana was elevated by law in the Capital of the province of Pallasca, this Act also gave him the title of \\"Villa\\" and on November 18, 1914 obtained the rank of City under Law No. 2631, a proposal of Priest Teodoro Gonzales Melendez and identified by Congressman Don Fausto Valdeavellano. On January 26, 1943, by Act No. 9821 the Pallasca province was divided into two provinces: Pallasca with its capital Cabana and Corongo with its capital Corongo city. This law rules until today's days. Cabana is one of the 11 districts that conforms the province of Pallasca in the Ancash Region. It limits the north with the districts of Bolognesi and the Huandoval, the east and the south with the province of Corongo and the west with the district of Tauca. Traditions and Festivities Engraved stone from Cabana. Belongs to the Pashash culture, around 500 AD Cabana with its impressive blue sky, has a varied climate all year round, rich in flora and fauna and people are very hospitable. From this spot we invite you to know our customs and traditions. =Easter= Easter is celebrated in Cabana similar to the festivities in Ayacucho, Peru. Easter is celebrated for an entire week. Starting on Palm Sunday in which the Cabanistas recall the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem sitting on a donkey. On Holy Wednesday, the statues of Jesus and Maria are taken out in procession, recalling the famous encounter between these two religious characters. On Holy Thursday, after Mass, where the priest wash the feet to the brotherhood members of Holy Thursday, the statue of Jesus crucified is taken out in procession. Good Friday at 3 pm the cabanistas recall the death of Jesus and later in the night the image of Jesus in his coffin is taken out in procession. On Holy Saturday the image of Jesus alive is taken out in procession =Santiago Apostle Festivities= The festivities in honor of Santiago Apostle is celebrated in two weeks in July each year. Starting July 16 and ends on July 25, the Central day. The festivities in honor of the Santiago Apostle, are probably the most important festivities celebrated in Cabana. For two weeks hundreds of people come to Cabana from all over the world to be witness and enjoy the food, dances and all that Cabana offers to its visitors. During these festivities, people in Cabana don't have time to rest. There is music all day long that goes until 4 or 5 in the morning. Visitors can find food and beverages for free during this festivities. For two weeks people dance in honor of Santiago Apostle but on July 24 and July 25, people in Cabana attend mass and procession of Santiago Apostle for the streets of Cabana. This festivity is also celebrated in Chimbote, Lima and in different cities in the United States of America . Dances They represent past events as a tribute to the beliefs, desires and reflections of a people, we would say that dances update the story of a place and its inhabitants. In the Andean world dances are preserved from centuries old. Cabana pays tribute to the Patron Santiago Apostle with colorful dances, among them are: The Mojiganga, The Blanquillos and The Kiyayas; each of them with varied components between choreography, costumes, songs, music and interpretation. =The Mojiganga= Castilian word that means jocoso - funny, this stamp was introduced by the Spaniards, they represent the social situation of the people, shows characters from various social strata. The Mojiganga can be seen in two moments in the patronal festivities, which takes place every year in July, (1) very early in the mornings run on the main streets of the city inviting the general public to the \\"paseo de res\\" (la vaca) that will be delivered in the afternoon to one of the devotees (stewards) of the party And (2) in the afternoon when delivering the Paseo de res (la vaca) and dance to the beat of cash or Roncador. The characters that are depicted are: the patron and the patrona who are the people who have money and in place, the shepherd and shepherdess representing mestizos or rural people and the Vilches who is the intermediate character, expresses power domain on the cattle. The dresses of the patron and patrona are very luxurious. The man wears suits, wearing a hat and cane, the lady wears dress, veil, wallet and shoes stick. The shepperds wear an elegant dress, suitable for the party. The lady wears an embroidered skirt, blouse, ojotas and straw hat, and the pastor's cloths are dress trousers, shirt, wool poncho, pannier, straw hat and carries a whip in his hand. The Vilches wears a dress embroidered with fine gold or silver thread, a crown of feathers with colored mirrors and, in the back enjalma carries a reminder that is painted or corduroy cloth embroidered with threads of gold leaf and presents varied reasons, also brings in a neck mo√±era (decorative ribbon) around the waist and a painted or embroidered pechera subsequently placed the res (la vaca). All of them wear special masks. =The Blanquillos= Groups of warriors who were born in reaction against Spanish domination, like the \\"Huanca\\" and \\"shacshas.\\" The Blanquillo, toured many parts of Culture Conchucos, where the Spaniards were in place for killing them. These groups were warriors formed by townpeople Pasha, Spaniards and mestizos. They used to go early in the mornings fighting in main square of the city, that is why this dance shows the power struggle of those years. In those days, the \\"Pashas\\" spoke the \\"Cully\\" language and worshipped the god \\"Catequilla \\". We can see this stamp on July 24 and July 25 of each year. The Blanquillo dance through the main streets of the city to accompany the procession of Santiago Apostle. The group formed by 10 or 12 people, all wear elegant dresses made of corduroy fabric, yarn ornaments with gold leaf (Spanish-style), carry a face mask, a crown of feathers and colorful scarf colors . In his tour, the Blanquillo with a unique style, put his scarf in the shoulder of someone in the audience who can reward him with money, candy or soda. =The Kiyayas= Cully word that means \\"consecrated women\\".

BOLOGNESI NOTICIAS Archaeology The archaeological site of Pashash is located near Cabana. It gave its name to the Pashash culture (500-1000 AD). Many artifacts of this culture have been found in the area. Pashash culture is seen as a later development of Recuay culture. It developed in the northern Sierra de Ancash region. Its remains are also found in Chacas, a town located in the east-central region of Ancash, and in other places.

Introduction Abdolhossein Teymourtash (Sardar Moazam Khorasani), a distinguished and influential Iranian politician of the 20th century, was born in Bojnord, Khorasan, to a prominent family, and received his formal education in Tsarist Russia, at the exclusive Imperial Nikolaev Military Academy in Saint Petersburg. He spoke fluent Persian, French, Russian, and German. He also had a strong command of English and Turkish. Abdolhossein Teymourtash is considered one of the most significant personalities in modern Iranian political history. Given his significant role in the transition of power from the Qajar to Pahlavi dynasties, he is identified closely with the Pahlavi for which he served as the first Minister of Court from 1925 to 1933. Nonetheless, Teymourtash's rise to prominence on the Iranian political scene predated the rise of Reza Shah to the throne in 1925, and his elevation to the second most powerful political position in the early Pahlavi era was preceded by a number of significant political appointments. Apart from having been elected to serve as a Member of Parliament to the 2nd (1909‚Äì1911); 3rd (1914‚Äì1915); 4th (1921‚Äì1923); 5th (1924‚Äì1926); and 6th (1926‚Äì1928) Majles of Iran, Teymourtash served in the following capacities: Governor of Gilan (1919‚Äì1920); Minister of Justice (1922); Governor of Kerman (1923‚Äì1924); and Minister of Public Works (1924‚Äì1925). As one of the earliest historians to have extensively examined Teymourtash's life has noted, \\"possessing a pronounced western outlook on life, he is said to have been by far one of the most cultivated and educated Persians of his day‚Äù. As such, apart from his significant accomplishments as one of the masterminds of the early Pahlavi era where he devised a number of fundamental bureaucratic reforms and navigated his country's foreign relations, Teymourtash has been credited with playing a significant role in shaping the intellectual and cultural currents that transformed Iran in the first half of the 20th century. Early years Teymourtash as a young cadet Abdolhossein Khan Teymourtash was born into a prominent family in 1883. His father, Karimdad Khan Nardini (Moa‚Äôzes al Molk), was a major landowner with extensive landholdings in Khorasan, Iran's northern province neighbouring the then Imperial Russia's Central Asia (now Turkmenistan). To provide his son with the best educational opportunities available to affluent Iranians of the late 19th century, Teymourtash's father dispatched him at the age of 11 to Tsarist Russia to receive a formal education. After enrolling for a year of preparatory school in Eshghabad in Russia, Teymourtash was sent to Saint Petersburg to pursue further studies. He was enrolled as a cavalry cadet at the venerated Imperial Nikolaev Military Academy, a preserve of the sons of the Russian aristocracy. The curriculum of the school was predominated mainly by military and administrative studies, but also allowed Teymourtash to adopt a fluent command of Russian, French and German, as well as familiarity with English. Teymourtash's eleven-year stay in Russia also led him to develop a lifelong passion for Russian and French literature, leading him to be the first Iranian to translate into Persian the masterful Russian literary works of Lermontov and Turgenev upon his return to Iran. Return to Iran Teymourtash visiting Europe to inform European Capitals of ascendancy of a new Shah in Persia (1907) Teymourtash visiting Europe as member of Persian Delegation informing European Capitals of the ascendancy of a new Shah (1907) Given his extensive absence from Iran, one of the first tasks Teymourtash set for himself upon returning to his native Iran was to retire to the seclusion of his family estates with the task of improving his Persian. With the help of a tutor, he spent approximately the first six months following his return to Iran to perfecting his native linguistic skills and devouring Persian poetry and literary masterpieces. His discipline and foresight during the period would serve him well, leading him, in due course, to be described as Iran's most gifted orator in its modern parliamentary experience. Another fortuitous development during the early years of his return to Iran, was his marriage to Sorour ol Saltaneh, the niece of the regent, Azod al Molk, and a relative of the Governor of Khorasan, Nayer al Dowleh. To congratulate the new couple on their wedding, the reigning Qajar Shah of the period bestowed the title Sardar Moazzam Khorasani on the young groom. Teymourtash's first employment upon returning to Iran was with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he served as a minor bureaucrat while acting as a Russian translator. Shortly thereafter, Teymourtash's father's connections to the court proved decisive and the 24‚Äëyear‚Äëold was appointed a member of a newly constituted delegation mandated to visit several European capitals to herald the inauguration of a new Qajar King to the throne, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar.  Constitutional revolution  As Essad Bey, an early chronicler of Teymourtash's life was to note in the 1930s, \\"unlike other Iranians of aristocratic houses, young Teymourtash brought back from Europe more than just an affection for occidental garb and an inclination for Persian nightclubs. Because old Persia offered no future for a man of such military training as he had received in Saint Petersburg, he decided to dedicate himself to politics‚Äù. Just as the last year of Teymourtash's stay in St. Petersburg coincided with the uprisings and revolts that would culminate in the Russian Revolution of 1905, Iran was soon to find itself in the convulsive throes of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Despite his father's staunch royalist tendencies and his ties to the royal court, young Teymourtash became an active member of the constitutional society headed by Malik al-Mutakallimin in Khorasan. While the rank and file of this particular society consisted mainly of lesser tradesman and poorer people, and included amongst its active membership very few educated notables, Teymourtash demonstrated his progressive tendencies by developing a strong affinity for the constitutional ideals and thrust of this gathering and assumed a leading role in the group. Teymourtash's active involvement in constitutional gatherings led, in due course, to his appointment as Chief of Staff of the populist constitutionalist forces resisting the reigning Monarch's decision to storm the buildings of Parliament. The constitutionalists forces eventually took sanctuary in Parliament to demand constitutionally entrenched rights and safeguards. Throughout the period, Teymourtash remained directly involved by training members of the constitutionalist volunteer militia, and demonstrated much bravery when clashes took place with the better trained and more numerous royalist forces. Despite the staunch efforts of the constitutionalists, the royalist forces prevailed by storming Parliament and dissolving the National Assembly. Teymourtash 1920s.  Election to Parliament and early political life  The following year when nationwide elections were held for the second Majlis of Iran, Teymourtash was elected the youngest Member of Parliament at the age of 26 from Neishabour, in his native Province of Khorasan. In subsequent elections he was re-elected as a deputy to the 3rd (1914‚Äì1915), 4th (1921‚Äì1923), 5th (1924‚Äì1926) and 6th (1926‚Äì1928) National Assemblies. However, given the sporadic convening of the Iranian Parliament, Teymourtash accepted a number of political appointments during the long intervening stretches between the dissolution of each session of Parliament and the reconvening of the next. Although Iran remained a non-belligerent during World War I, it suffered more economic devastation than any other neutral country during the period. Nonetheless, in 1918, the new Soviet Government renounced all previous concessions granted by Iran to Tsarist Russia. Intent on capitalizing on the military withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, and the attendant decision by the Soviet authorities to diminish their political interference in its domestic affairs, Great Britain decided that the time was ripe to consolidate its de facto control of Iran. To accomplish such an objective, the British set out to prevail upon the Iranian Government that it should cede financial, military and diplomatic authority in return for much needed financial and military assistance. The British succeeded in their design by offering the then Iranian Prime Minister, and its Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs, sizeable bribes to ensure that they would acquiesce to the British demand to devise a virtual protectorate over Iran. It was agreed that neither the bribes nor the terms of the Agreement would be made public, and that the scheme would be portrayed as a necessity to forestall the chaos that had enveloped Iran in the aftermath of the devastating impact of the war. However, the secrecy shrouding the negotiation of the 1919 Agreement, and the failure to summon Parliament to ratify it prompted nationalist politicians to seize the opportunity to galvanize public opposition to the agreement. Recognizing the brewing controversy, the Government of Iran on advice of the British Government refrained from reconvening Parliament which it was assumed would refuse to ratify the Agreement. At this juncture, Teymourtash emerged as one of the main politicians to voice early opposition to the agreement by co- authoring a general proclamation signed by 41 members of parliament referred to as the ‚ÄúStatement of Truth‚Äù which denounced the Agreement of 1919. The proclamation proved effective in consolidating popular opposition against the Agreement, leading the British Government to eventually abandon the scheme altogether. Teymourtash served as the Governor of Gilan from 1919‚Äì1920. His Governorship of Gilan was to prove particularly noteworthy given the reality that his primary mandate was to counter secessionist forces in that province led by Mirza Kuchak Khan who received assistance from the new Bolshevik Government in the neighbouring Soviet Union. Teymourtash's term as Governor of Gilan was to prove short-lived, lasting less than a year, after which he was recalled to the capital without the balance of power between central government forces and those of the Soviet-backed insurgents having shifted in any particular direction. Some Iranian historians have accused Teymourtash of having used undue force in resisting the secessionists, but records that could corroborate such an account have not been presented. He may have been appointed civilian governor, but at the same time a Cossack officer, Starosselsky, had been appointed military governor with unfettered powers to quell the jangali successionist movement. In fact, Mirza Kuchak Khan's followers put on trial during Teymourtash's term were court martialed by a five-member tribunal consisting entirely of Cossack officers. A Soviet Republic of Gilan was declared in June 1920, after Teymourtash's return to Tehran, lasting until October 1921. Given Teymourtash's concern with protecting the territorial integrity of Iran from the secessionist troops led by Mirza Kuchak Khan, upon his recall to Tehran, along with Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee, he approached the British legation in the capital to solicit their support to resist the insurgents in the North. In return for British financial assistance, Teymourtash proposed an arrangement whereby he would assume personal command of troops to repel advances made by Mirza Kuchak Khan and his supporters. Although the British legation in Tehran seemed favourably impressed with the plan, officials in the British foreign office at Whitehall refused to approve the proposal due to financial considerations. On February 21, 1921, a group of Anglophile political activists led by Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee, the rising young journalist, succeeded in plotting a coup that toppled the Iranian Government, while vowing to preserve the Qajar monarchy. The military strongman commanding the Persian Cossack Brigade that descended on Tehran was to be Reza Khan. Reza Khan had successfully consolidated his hold over this cavalry unit when its Tsarist commanding officers departed Iran due to the revolutionary upheaval and the ensuing Civil War that engulfed their country. While the Coup lasted approximately 100 days, it proved to be the stepping stone allowing Reza Khan to consolidate his power and, in due course, to ascend to the throne several years later. Although, according to the British archives, Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee offered Teymourtash a cabinet portfolio, Teymourtash refused to join the former's government. In the aftermath of the coup a number of Iranian political notables, including Teymourtash, were imprisoned to forestall opposition. Teymourtash was not initially singled out as one of the members of Parliament to be incarcerated. The decision to have him arrested followed an exchange he had with one of the British diplomats in Tehran at an official function whereby he publicly accused the British Government of having masterminded the putsch led by Sayyad Zia and Reza Khan. After being briefly held in prison, Teymourtash was exiled to Qom where he was held until the coup collapsed several months later. Soon after being released, Teymourtash returned to Tehran and was appointed Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Hassan Pirnia (\\"Moshir al Dowleh\\"), with a mandate to initiate the process of modernizing the court system in Iran based on the French judicial model. However, the collapse of the Government shortly thereafter prevented Teymourtash from fundamentally restructuring the Iranian judicial system. Nonetheless, during his brief term as Minister of Justice, he succeeded in securing parliamentary approval to suspend the operation of certain courts and administrative bodies, and dismissed judges and magistrates deemed grossly incompetent. Moreover, given the necessity of expanding the purview of the secular judiciary, state courts were granted partial appellate jurisdiction over religious courts during Teymourtash's term as Minister of Justice. He resigned from Parliament for the balance of its term and served as Governor of Kerman for the following year and a half. With the advent of a new government, Teymourtash was once again summoned to join Cabinet as the Minister of Public Works. Among his most notable accomplishments in his capacity as Minister of Public works in 1924 made the far reaching decision to draft a detailed proposal to the Iranian Parliament in 1924 introducing a tax on tea and sugar to finance the construction of a Trans-Iranian Railway, a project which was ultimately completed twelve years later in 1937. The economic merits of such a financing scheme would allow Iran to complete the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway in 1937 by relying entirely on local capital. Another significant initiative introduced by Teymourtash during his tenure as the Minister of Public Works was the introduction of legislation annulling the French monopoly concession for excavating antiquities in Iran in a bid to usher in an open door policy whereby excavators from other countries could assist in unearthing Iranian national treasures and antiquities. As Murray, the American Minister to Tehran noted at the time, ‚ÄúMeanwhile the indefatigable Sardar Moazzam, Minister of Public Works, has introduced to the Medjliss his bill which proposes the abrogation of all Imperial firmans and concessions obtained thereby, which will of course include that held by the French‚Äù. Although the bill was originally conceived and drafted while Teymourtash served as Minister of Public Works, it finally secured passage through the Majles in 1927. During the 1920s, alongside his varied political engagements, Teymourtash also devoted considerable time to literary and cultural pursuits. Given his longstanding acquaintance with many of Iran's leading intellectuals and writers, he joined the editorial board of Daneshkadeh, a periodical established by Mohammad Taghi Bahar (\\"Malekol Sho'ara\\"), one of Iran's leading intellectual luminaries. As revealed by Saeed Naficy (or Nafisi), one of the other distinguished ^ \\"ŸæŸà€åÿß€å€å ŸÅÿ±ŸáŸÜ⁄Ø Ÿáÿ± ⁄©ÿ¥Ÿàÿ± €å ÿØÿ± \\"ÿ¢ÿ≤ÿßÿØ€å\\" ŸÜŸáŸÅÿ™Ÿá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™\\". Archived from the original on 2005-11-29. Retrieved 2006-03-31. members of the editorial board of Daneshkadeh, Teymourtash contributed extensively to this publication by drafting numerous articles, as well as translating various articles originating in European journals. However, the reality that these articles were penned under the pseudonym ‚ÄúS.M. Khorasani‚Äù, would unfortunately lead Teymourtash's literary talents to escape the attention of future Iranian academics. Teymourtash's abiding interest in literature would in fact lead him to advocate in favour of securing government funds to allow Allameh Ghazvinihttp://www.irib.ir/Occasions/allameh%20ghazvini/allameh.en.HTM to undertake an elaborate project to copy old Persian manuscripts available in European library collections. The funding permitted Allameh Ghazvini to spend many years visiting libraries in London, Paris, Leningrad, Berlin, and Cairo where he secured copies of rare manuscripts which he subsequently forwarded to Tehran to be utilized by Iranian scholars. In other instances, Teymourtash used his political influence to assist intellectuals and writers such as his interventions to ensure that the renowned historian Ahmad Kasravi would be spared harassment by the government apparatus while undertaking research, and his success in securing a seat for noted poet Mohammad Taghi Bahar to the 5th Majles from Bojnourd district which he had himself previously represented. Furthermore, he is known to have successfully interceded with Reza Shah on behalf of journalist Mirza Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi to ensure the latter would be spared harm should he return to Iran from Germany after he had authored articles critical of the Shah while residing abroad. Upon returning to Iran in 1932, Mirza Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi remained immune from government harassment for several years, although he was subsequently indicted in 1935 several years after Teymourtash's fall from grace. Teymourtash's voracious intellectual appetite led him to assemble one of the most extensive private library collections in Iran. No effort was spared in this endeavour, and Teymourtash was recognized as one of the country's most generous patrons of literary works and Persian calligraphy. Among the many works he commissioned, a notable example was the Testament of Ardashir into Persian. Indeed, the title page of the first edition published in Tehran in 1932 would read as follows: ‚ÄúThis unique and most important historical document is offered to his Imperial Majesty by His Excellency Mr. Teymourtash, the Minister of the Sublime Court‚Äù Even more significant was the prescient role Teymourtash assumed by establishing the Society for National Heritage in the early 1920s. In due course, this society was joined by some of Iran's leading personalities and assumed a critical role advocating in favour of archeological discoveries, the construction of mausoleums to honour Iran's past poets, and the establishment of museums and libraries in the decades that followed. The society spurred considerable interest by western orientalists to undertake archaeological excavations in Iran, and lay the foundation for the construction of a mausoleum to honour Ferdowsi in 1934 and of Hafez in 1938, to name a few of its more notable early achievements. Teymourtash believed that the \\"services of Firdawsi toward preserving Iranian nationality and creating national unity must be compared to the services of Cyrus the Great\\". As such during a visit to Paris in 1931, Teymourtash took time out of his busy schedule to visit Exposition coloniale, while in Moscow he arranged to view Lenin's Mausoleum. The Ernst Herzfeld Archives in fact reveal that Teymourtash made some final changes to the decorative designs adorning the Ferdowsi mausoleum. While the Society remained active for many decades that followed, there was never any mention that the initial creation of the Society was largely made possible by the personal efforts of Teymourtash. Apart from convening early meetings of the Society at his residence in the early 1920s, he spared no effort to solicit and engage the interest of Iran's leading political and educational elites, such as two of the earliest recruits, Isa Sadiq and Arbab Keikhosrow Shahrokh. Teymourtash holding the royal crown of the Pahlavi King Reza Khan. Appointed Minister of Court It was Teymourtash's appointment as Minister of Court in 1925 that proved invaluable in allowing him to demonstrate his prowess as a formidable administrator, and to establish his reputation as an indefatigable statesman intent on successfully laying the foundations of modern Iran. In this capacity, Teymourtash assumed the powers of a Grand Vizier in all but name, a position that allowed its occupant to dominate the affairs of state within previous Persian dynasties. The dominant position of Teymourtash, and the attendant privileges enjoyed by him, were described as follows in a cable drafted by Clive, the British diplomat in Tehran, to Whitehall in 1928: > \\"As Minister of the Court he has acquired the position of the Shah's most > intimate political adviser. His influence is ubiquitous, and his power > exceeds that of the Prime Minister. He attends all meetings of the Council > of Ministers, and one might compare his position with that of Reich > Chancellor, except that he has no direct responsibility.\\" Although the appointment of Teymourtash as Reza Shah's first Minister of Court proved an inspired selection, it came as a surprise to members of the political establishment in Tehran. The capital's chattering classes were surprised that Reza Shah had not opted for one of his Persian Cossack Brigade colleagues who had accompanied him on his many military campaigns or that he did not appoint another individual with whom he had shared a more intimate or lengthy acquaintance. However, it can be assumed that Reza Shah was favourably impressed by Teymourtash's legislative maneuvers during meetings of the constituent assembly that voted overwhelmingly in favour of the deposition of the Qajar dynasty. It was, after all, primarily the collaboration between Ali Akbar Davar and Teymourtash that had led to the drafting of the Inqiraz bill which was adopted by the Majlis by a vote of 80‚Äì5 on 31 October 1925 that paved the way for Reza Shah to assume the throne. Moreover, in the period following the Coup of 1921, Teymourtash had been instrumental in successfully navigating legislation through the Iranian parliament whereby it became possible for Reza Khan to assume full jurisdiction over Iran's defence apparatus in his capacity as Commander in Chief. Apart from appreciating Teymourtash's strong grasp of the parliamentary and legislative process, it is likely that the decision to appoint him as his first Minister of Court was animated by Reza Shah's keen interest in selecting an urbane individual familiar with diplomatic protocol who could impress foreign capitals, as well as an energetic and workaholic reformer capable of introducing discipline to the administration of government. Teymourtash in Official Court Uniform. Lacking any semblance of a formal education, the new Reza Shah maintained his firm grip over all matters pertaining to the army and internal security, while Teymourtash was left a free hand to devise blueprints for modernizing the country, orchestrating the political implementation of much needed bureaucratic reforms, and acting as the principal steward of its foreign relations. Such a division of responsibilities would bode well for Iran given the increased vigour which would characterise its diplomacy on a host of issues in the coming years. As an American diplomat familiar with the personalities of Reza Shah and Teymourtash was to note in 1933, after the latter was relieved of his duties by the former, \\"In contrast to his former right hand man, the Shah is untutored, irascible, ruthless, and totally lacking in cosmopolitanism or knowledge of the world.‚Äù As many contemporaries have corroborated, in 1926 Reza Shah informed members of his Cabinet that ‚ÄúTeymourtash's word is my word‚Äù, and for the first seven years of his reign, Teymourtash ‚Äúbecame virtually the Shah's alter ego‚Äù. While Teymourtash, in his capacity as Minister of Court was not officially a member of the Council of Ministers, his secure position at the pinnacle in effect led Prime Ministers to act as mere figureheads and the cabinet to assume a mostly decorative function. A review of the diplomatic correspondence emanating from Iran amply highlights the extent to which Teymourtash played a critical role in ensuring that the machinery of government ran smoothly. In 1926 Clive, the British diplomat, wrote to London about mental malaise evident in Reza Shah by stating ‚Äúhis energy appears for the moment to have deserted him; his faculties have been clouded by the fumes of opium, which have distorted his judgement and induced long spells of sullen and secretive lethargy punctuated by nightmare suspicions or by spasms of impulsive rage‚Äù. However, when Teymourtash returned from his diplomatic trip of several months abroad, Clive was to report back to London that Teimurtash was instrumental in jolting Reza Shah out of his lethargy. In his capacity as Minister of Court, Teymourtash took an active hand in devising the bureaucracy, and his unrivalled command over its parts made him the most powerful man in Iranian society. He thus skilfully dictated most of the policies and supervised their progress. A report prepared by the American representative in Tehran, Murray Hart, illustrates the breadth of Teymourtash's knowledge of the various aspects of the bureaucracy: > \\"After my first few meetings with him I began to suspect that his brilliancy > had the elements of madness. He impressed me as just too bright, this was > because the man's gifts were so extraordinary as to appear unnatural. > Whether it was foreign affairs, the construction of railways or highways, > reforms in post and telegraphs, educational administration or finance, he, > as a rule, could discuss those subjects more intelligently than the so- > called competent ministers. Besides, he devised formulas for the country's > economic rehabilitation, made treaties, supervised the complicated questions > regarding what to do with the tribes and told the War Minister much he did > not know about organizing a system of national defence. The Soviet > commercial treaty and the trade monopoly laws are unmistakable monuments to > his versatility.\\" Teymourtash was conferred the royal title of Jenab-i-Ashraf (His Highness) in September 1928. Teymourtash among deputies to the Eighth Majles.  Domestic affairs  During Teymourtash's term as Minister of Court, the court ministry became the nucleus of a modern centralized bureaucracy. By all accounts Teymourtash used his position at the pinnacle to full effect by working tirelessly to ensure that the machinery of government pursued an ambitious agenda. Among the principal functions of the new Minister of Court were to mediate the relations between Reza Shah and the cabinet and parliament, and to serve as an arbiter among government institutions with overlapping responsibilities. Most members of cabinet, including the Prime Minister, consisted of cautious and traditional administrators impervious to the need for rapid modernization or reform. The exceptions to this general rule were some of the younger, better educated and more competent members of Cabinet who displayed a more spirited inculcation, such as Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh Farman Farmaian III, who became the Minister of Finance, and Ali Akbar Davar who was appointed the Minister of Justice in the early Pahlavi period. Consequently, the three formed what was to be commonly referred to as the \\"governing triumvirate\\", which began to constitute itself in the immediate aftermath of Reza Shah's coronation. While the three provided much of the intellectual and ideological inspiration for reform, it was Teymourtash who played the leading role and acted as the principal architect of the various reforms instituted during the first seven years of Reza Shah's reign. The persistent foreign interventions of the previous decades that had brought Iran to the brink of social and economic chaos had led to the emergence of secular nationalists intent on securing the country's independence by steering clear of the previous pattern of endless compromise with foreign powers for short- term political gain. Given their aversion to Iran's centrifugal tendencies and their inclination to centralize governmental powers by creating an expanded bureaucracy, such nationalists were in favour of creating national institutions that would withstand provincial autonomous tendencies. After all, the Qajar dynasty's inability to provide a strong administrative and military apparatus had led the country to come apart at the seams with the growth of secessionist provincial movements in several provinces during the first two decades of the 20th century. The creation of a modernized central government, on the other hand, would establish the means to collect revenues and to introduce drastic reforms in the country. Another key element for such nationalists was to drastically undermine the prerogatives enjoyed by the Shia religious establishment which detracted from attempts at modernisation. Devising diverse development projects required the creation of a large bureaucracy capable of initiating and fostering ambitious industrialization and urbanization processes capable of significantly transforming Iranian society. As such, in the first five years of the Reza Shah period, Iran developed a network of railroads that connected ports to inland cities, thereby encouraging trade between rural and urban centers.http://www.memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ir0090) The functioning of such a burgeoning state apparatus would require the development of increased political support by promoting drastic and far-reaching economic reforms. As such, in 1926 a new School of Commerce was created, and the government assumed the lead in establishing a Chamber of Commerce. The government also proceeded to encourage the development of private industry by offering financial incentives such as government-sanctioned monopolies and low interest loans to prospective local factory owners. In 1928 another significant step towards establishing fiscal order was taken with the establishment of the National bank (\\"Bank-e Melli\\") which assumed functions previously reserved to the British Imperial Bank. Legal reforms to strengthen property rights and to create an atmosphere conducive to commercial investment were also gradually devised, and shortly thereafter a Bar Association (\\"Kanoon-e Vokala\\") was created in 1930. Establishing a modern educational system, as an indispensable instrument of social change, was therefore a primary objective of secular nationalist during this period. As such, one of the realms in which Teymourtash assumed a direct and principal role was in revamping Iran's educational system, and from 1925 to 1932 Education Ministers would share their authority with the powerful and influential Court Minister. By 1921, recognizing the need for creating a cadre of foreign educated professionals, the Iranian Government had sent sixty students to French military academies. With the advent of the Pahlavi era, the range of studies for government sponsored students sent abroad was extended in 1926 to encompass broader disciplines, most notably engineering. Furthermore, to adopt a more systematic approach, a bill was passed in 1928 establishing a fully state-funded program to finance the sending of 100 students a year to Europe. Other significant initiatives of the early Pahlavi era were attempts to secularize the educational system by providing funding for state schools to gradually dominate the provision of elementary education at the expense of the traditional religious schools referred to as maktabs. This was achieved by a 1927 decree which provided free education for those unable to afford tuition fees. In the following year, inspired by the French Lycee model, a uniform curriculum was established for high schools, and the Ministry of Education began publishing academic textbooks free of charge for all needy students and at cost for others. A concerted effort was also made to substantially increase the enrolment of females in schools. While a mere 120 girls had graduated from schools in 1926, by 1932 the number had increased substantially to 3713. Indeed, by 1930, Teymourtash's eldest daughter Iran who had recently graduated from the American Girls high school in Tehran founded an association of women with the intended goal of establishing a boarding school for destitute women. Also, during the same period Teymourtash's younger sister Badri Teymourtash was sent to Belgium and enrolled in dental studies, and upon her return was to be the first female dentist in the country. In fact by the 1960s, Dr. Badri Teymourtash, would assist in founding a school of dentistry at Mashhad University in Khorasan. The list of domestic institutes of secondary and higher education also increased substantially during this period, although such institutions were associated and funded by various ministries. In 1927 the Faculty of Political Science from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the School of law of the Ministry of Justice were merged to form an independent School of Law and Political Science. Moreover, the first step in creating a bona fide university occurred in 1929 when Teymourtash officially commissioned Isa Sadiq to draft plans for the foundation of a university, which would lead to the establishment of Tehran University several years later. Teymourtash assumed the intellectual leadership of Iranian reformists during this period, acting both as the principal initiator and executor of the many initiatives that followed. Among the shortcomings of the Iranian Parliament was that meaningful reform had been held hostage to the reality that the Majles lacked genuine political parties and the political dynamics within parliament centered around the agency of powerful men. Therefore, the Majles was composed of factions represented by ever shifting alignments and the temporary coalition of individuals created with respect to a particular issue, rather than individual members beholden to party discipline or a particular cohesive platform. Teymourtash circa 1930 To overcome factions that undermined efforts to advance reforms required by the country, Teymourtash established a fascist political party named Iran-e Now (\\"The New Iran\\") in an attempt to introduce discipline to Iran's chaotic Parliament. Such an effort received the approval of Reza Shah and was welcomed by deputies who recognized the need for a more systematic approach to the legislative process. However, soon after being established in 1927 the Iran-Now party encountered resistance from rival politicians who cultivated the support of mullahs and other reactionary elements to form a competing Zidd-i Ajnabiha (\\"Anti-foreign\\") party. Apart from directly attacking the Iran-Now Party's secular tendencies, the Zidd-i Ajnabiha group mobilized support by attacking the legal reforms being initiated by Ali Akbar Davar, and challenged the newly initiated conscription law. Rather than clamp down on such a challenge and the ensuing partisan bickering, Reza Shah is said to have surreptitiously supported and engaged in double dealing to support both of the competing groups. In a Machiavellian twist, Reza Shah dissolved the Iran-e Now in 1928 demonstrating that he preferred the tried-and-true and time honoured technique of relying on individuals who could be cajoled to support his whims, and demonstrating his deep suspicion even of institutions and collective bodies he himself had approved. Ironically, the failure to devise an organized political party, or to create durable institutions are generally considered to have been the greatest shortcomings of the Reza Shah period which would in turn lead to the demise of his rule in 1941. Another initiative of Teymourtash's that proved significant was his founding of the Iran social club, which was to have significant social implications. This social club, the first of its kind in Tehran, proved a popular convening point for the social elite and the young and upwardly mobile educated members of society that formed the backbone of a burgeoning bureaucracy. It proved an ideal gathering ground for networking opportunities for individuals vying to cultivate and emulate the latest western norms of proper etiquette and social behaviour. Given its avant garde pretensions, it is not surprising that it paved the way for gaining social acceptance for the official policy of unveiling, since ministers and members of parliament appeared at the club once a week with their unveiled wives in mixed gatherings several years before such a practise was displayed on a more popular and widespread basis in other settings. Teymourtash arriving in Moscow in 1926 for diplomatic negotiations Foreign affairs The primary foreign policy objective pursued by Iran during the early Pahlavi era was to loosen the economic grasp of foreign powers on Iran, and in particular to mitigate the influence of Britain and the Soviet Union. While a number of individuals were appointed as Iran's Foreign Ministers, their capacity to act as the architects of the country's foreign affairs was nominal. It was the energetic Teymourtash who became the principal steward and strategist who managed Iran's foreign relations during the first seven years of the Pahlavi dynasty, a task for which he was eminently suited. Teymourtash assumed the lead role in negotiating broadly on the widest range of treaties and commercial agreements, while Ministers ostensibly in charge of Iran's Foreign Ministry such as Mohammad Ali Foroughi and Mohammad Farzin were relegated mainly to administering official correspondence with foreign governments, and assumed roles akin to the Court Minister's clerk. Teymourtash upon being conferred France's highest civilian honour, the Legion d'honneur in Paris. Among the first acts performed by Teymourtash in the realm of foreign affairs shortly after he assumed the position of Minister of Court was travel to the Soviet Union in 1926 on a two-month visit. The lengthy discussions led to the adoption of a number of significant commercial agreements, a development deemed significant by ensuring Britain would be precluded from exercising its domineering economic position since the negotiation of the Perso-Russian Treaty of 1921, whereby the Soviet Government agreed to the removal of its troops from Iran. To this end, Teymourtash also attempted to assiduously foster improved economic ties with other industrialised countries, amongst them the United States and Germany. During this period, Iran also assumed a lead role in cultivating closer ties with its neighbours, Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan. All these countries were pursuing similar domestic modernization plans, and they collectively fostered increased cooperation and formed a loose alliance as a bloc, leading the Western powers to fear what they believed was the creation of an Asiatic Alliance. In the mid to late 1920s the Turkish and Iranian governments signed a number of frontier and security agreements. Furthermore, when King Amanullah of Afghanistan faced tribal unrest in 1930 which would ultimately lead to his removal from the throne, the Iranian government sent out several planeloads of officers of the Iranian Army to assist the Afghan King quell the revolt. Indeed, the diplomatic steps that were first taken in the 1920s, would eventually lead to the adoption of the non-aggression agreement known as the Treaty of Saadabad between the four countries in 1937. Another significant initiative spearheaded by Teymourtash was the concerted effort to eliminate the complex web of capitulation agreements Iran had granted various foreign countries during the Qajar dynasty. Such agreements conferred extraterritorial rights to the foreign residents of subject countries, and its origins in Iran could be traced back to the Russo-Iranian Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. Despite considerable opposition from the various foreign governments that had secured such privileges, Teymourtash personally conducted these negotiations on behalf of Iran, and succeeded in abrogating all such agreements by 1928. Teymourtash's success in these endeavours owed much to his ability to methodically secure agreements from the less obstinate country's first so as to gain greater leverage against the holdouts, and to even intimate that Iran was prepared to break diplomatic relations with recalcitrant states if need be. Teymourtash's success in revoking the capitulation treaties, and the failure of the Anglo- Iranian Agreement of 1919 earlier, led to intense diplomatic efforts by the British government to regularize relations between the two countries on a treaty basis. The ire of the British Government was raised, however, by Persian diplomatic claims to the oil rich regions of the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, Abu Musa and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf region. On the economic front, on the other hand, the Minister of Court's pressures to rescind the monopoly rights of the British-owned Imperial Bank of Persia to issue banknotes in Iran, the Iranian Trade Monopoly Law of 1928, and prohibitions whereby the British Government and APOC were no longer permitted to enter into direct agreements with their client tribes, as had been the case in the past, did little to satisfy British expectations. The cumulative impact of these demands on the British Government was well expressed by Sir Robert Clive, Britain's Minister to Tehran, who in 1931 noted in a report to the Foreign Office \\"There are indications, indeed that their present policy is to see how far they can push us in the way of concessions, and I feel we shall never re-establish our waning prestige or even be able to treat the Persian government on equal terms, until we are in a position to call a halt\\". Despite an enormous volume of correspondence and protracted negotiations underway between the two countries on the widest array of issues, on the Iranian side Teymourtash conducted the negotiations single-handedly ‚Äúwithout so much as a secretary to keep his papers in order‚Äù, according to one scholar. Resolution of all outstanding differences eluded a speedy resolution, however, since the British side progressed more tediously due to the need to consult many government departments. Teymourtash and Benito Mussolini. The most intractable challenge, however, proved to be Teymourtash's assiduous efforts to revise the terms whereby the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) retained near monopoly control over the oil industry in Iran as a result of the concession granted to William Knox D'Arcy in 1901 by the Qajar King of the period. \\"What Persians felt\\", Teymourtash would explain to his British counterparts in 1928, \\"was that an industry had been developed on their own soil in which they had no real share\\". Complicating matters further, and ensuring that such demands would in due course set Teymourtash on a collision course with the British Government was the reality that pursuant to a 1914 Act of the British Parliament, an initiative championed by Winston Churchill in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty, led the British Government to be granted a majority fifty-three percent ownership of the shares of APOC. The decision was adopted during World War I to ensure the British Government would gain a critical foothold in Iranian affairs so as to protect the flow of oil from Iran due to its critical importance to the operation of the Royal navy during the war effort. By the 1920s APOC's extensive installations and pipelines in Khuzestan and its refinery in Abadan meant that the company's operations in Iran had led to the creation of the greatest industrial complex in the Middle East. By this period, popular opposition to the D'Arcy oil concession and royalty terms whereby Iran only received 16 percent of net profits was widespread. Since industrial development and planning, as well as other fundamental reforms were predicated on oil revenues, the government's lack of control over the oil industry served to accentuate the Iranian Government's misgivings regarding the manner in which APOC conducted its affairs in Iran. Such a pervasive atmosphere of dissatisfaction seemed to suggest that a radical revision of the concession terms would be possible. Moreover, owing to the introduction of reforms that improved fiscal order in Iran, APOC's past practise of cutting off advances in oil royalties when its demands were not met had lost much of its sting. The attempt to revise the terms of the oil concession on a more favourable basis for Iran led to protracted negotiations that took place in Tehran, Lausanne, London and Paris between Teymourtash and the Chairman of APOC, First Baron, Sir John Cadman, 1st Baron Cadman, spanning the years from 1928 to 1932. The overarching argument for revisiting the terms of the D'Arcy Agreement on the Iranian side was that its national wealth was being squandered by a concession that was granted in 1901 by a previous non- constitutional government forced to agree to inequitable terms under duress. In order to buttress his position in talks with the British, Teymourtash retained the expertise of French and Swiss oil experts. Teymourtash demanded a revision of the terms whereby Iran would be granted 25% of APOC's total shares. To counter British objections, Teymourtash would state that \\"if this had been a new concession, the Persian Government would have insisted not on 25 percent but on a 50‚Äì50 basis.\\" Teymourtash also asked for a minimum guaranteed interest of 12.5% on dividends from the shares of the company, plus 2s per ton of oil produced. In addition, he specified that the company was to reduce the existing area of the concession. The intent behind reducing the area of the concession was to push APOC operations to the southwest of the country so as to make it possible for Iran to approach and lure non-British oil companies to develop oilfields on more generous terms in areas not part of APOC's area of concession. Apart from demanding a more equitable share of the profits of the Company, an issue that did not escape Teymourtash's attention was that the flow of transactions between APOC and its various subsidiaries deprived Iran of gaining an accurate and reliable appreciation of APOC's full profits. As such, he demanded that the company register itself in Tehran as well as London, and the exclusive rights of transportation of the oil be cancelled. In fact in the midst of the negotiations in 1930, the Iranian Majles approved a bill whereby APOC was required to pay a 4 percent tax on its prospective profits earned in Iran. In the face of British prevarification, Teymourtash decided to demonstrate Iranian misgivings by upping the ante. Apart from encouraging the press to draft editorials criticizing the terms of the D'Arcy concession, he arranged to dispatch a delegation consisting of Reza Shah, and other political notables and journalists to the close vicinity of the oilfields to inaugurate a newly constructed road, with instructions that they refrain from visiting the oil installation in an explicit show of protest. In 1931, Teymourtash who was travelling to Europe to enrol Crown Prince Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and his own children at European schools, decided to use the occasion to attempt to conclude the negotiations. The following passage from Sir John Cadman, 1st Baron Cadman confirms that Teymourtash worked feverishly and diligently to resolve all outstanding issues, and succeeded in securing an agreement in principle: > \\"He came to London, he wined and he dined and he spent day and night in > negotiating. Many interviews took place. He married his daughter, he put his > boy to school [Harrow], he met the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a > change took place in our government, and in the midst of all this maze of > activities we reached a tentative agreement on the principles to be included > in the new document, leaving certain figures and the lump sum to be settled > at a later date.\\" However, while Teymourtash likely believed that after four years of exhaustive and detailed discussions, he had succeeded in navigating the negotiations on the road to a conclusive end, the latest negotiations in London were to prove nothing more than a cul de sac. Matters came to a head in 1931, when the combined effects of overabundant oil supplies on the global markets and the economic destabilization of the Depression, led to fluctuations which drastically reduced annual payments accruing to Iran to a fifth of what it had received in the previous year. In that year, APOC informed the Iranian government that its royalties for the year would amount to a mere 366,782 pounds, while in the same period the company's income taxes paid to the British Government amounted to approximately 1,000,000. Furthermore, while the company's profits declined 36 percent for the year, the revenues paid to the Iranian government pursuant to the company's accounting practices, decreased by 76 percent. Such a precipitous drop in royalties appeared to confirm suspicions of bad faith, and Teymourtash indicated that the parties would have to revisit negotiations. However, Reza Shah was soon to assert his authority by dramatically inserting himself into the negotiations. The Monarch attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers in November 1932, and after publicly rebuking Teymourtash for his failure to secure an agreement, dictated a letter to cabinet cancelling the D'Arcy Agreement. The Iranian Government notified APOC that it would cease further negotiations and demanded cancellation of the D'Arcy concession. Rejecting the cancellation, the British government espoused the claim on behalf of APOC and brought the dispute before the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, asserting that it regarded itself \\"as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the Company's protection.\\" At this point, Hasan Taqizadeh, the new Iranian minister to have been entrusted the task of assuming responsibility for the oil dossier, was to intimate to the British that the cancellation was simply meant to expedite negotiations and that it would constitute political suicide for Iran to withdraw from negotiations. Teymourtash on State Visit to Belgium with wife  Imprisonment and death  Shortly thereafter, Teymourtash was dismissed from office by Reza Shah. Within weeks of his dismissal in 1933, Teymourtash was arrested, and although charges were not specified, it was rumoured that his fall related to his secretly setting up negotiations with the APOC. In his last letter addressed to his family from Qasr prison, he defensively wrote: > \\"according to the information I have received, in the eyes of His Majesty my > mistake seems to have been that I defended the Company and the English (the > irony of it all - It has been England's plot to ruin me and it is they who > have struck me down); I have refuted this concoction which was served up by > the English press; I have already written to Sardar As'ad telling him I > never signed anything with the company, that our last session with Sir John > Cadman, 1st Baron Cadman and the others had broken off\\". The principal reason for Teymourtash's dismissal very likely had to do with British machinations to ensure that the able Minister of Court was removed from heading Iranian negotiations on discussions relating to a revision of the terms of the D'Arcy concession. As such, the British made every effort to raise concerns with the suspicion-prone Reza Shah that the very survival of his dynasty rested on the shoulders of Teymourtash who would not hesitate to take matters into his own hands should the monarch die. To ensure that Reza Shah did not consider releasing Teymourtash even after he had fallen from favour, the British also took to persuading the British press to pen flattering stories whereby they attributed all the reforms that had taken place in Iran to him \\"down to, or up to, the Shah's social and hygiene education\\". It is generally agreed that Teymourtash proved a convenient scapegoat for the deteriorating relations between the British and Iranian governments After the dispute between the two countries was taken up at the Hague, the Czech Foreign Minister who was appointed mediator put the matter into abeyance to allow the contending parties to attempt to resolve the dispute. Reza Shah who had stood firm in demanding the abolition of the D'Arcy concession, suddenly acquiesced to British demands, much to the chagrin and disappointment of his Cabinet. A new agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was agreed to after Sir John Cadman visited Iran in April 1933 and was granted a private audience with the Shah. A new Agreement was ratified by Majles, on May 28, 1933, and received Royal assent the following day. The terms of the new agreement provided for a new sixty-year concession. The agreement reduced the area under APOC control to , required annual payments in lieu of Iranian income tax, as well as guaranteeing a minimum annual payment of 750,000 pounds to the Iranian government. These provisions while appearing favourable, are widely agreed to have represented a squandered opportunity for the Iranian government. It extended the life of the D'Arcy concession by an additional thirty-two years, negligently allowed APOC to select the best , the minimum guaranteed royalty was far too modest, and in a fit of carelessness the company's operations were exempted from import or customs duties. Finally, Iran surrendered its right to annul the agreement, and settled on a complex and tediously elaborate arbitration process to settle any disagreements that should arise. Despite the resolution of the Iranian dispute with APOC, Teymourtash remained incarcerated in prison, and charges of minor embezzlement were leveled against him. The increasingly arbitrary Pahlavi monarch had previously meted out similar fabricated charges against other leading politicians before, a course of action which would be repeatedly resorted to against others as well after Teymourtash had been removed. A court sentenced Teymourtash on spurious charges to five years of solitary confinement and a total fine of 10,712 pounds sterling and 585,920 rials on charges of embezzlement and graft. (Figures are in 1933 values) Teymourtash was confined in Qasr Prison in Tehran. His health rapidly declined and he died on October 3, 1933. Many say he was killed by the prison's physician Dr. Ahmad Ahmadi through lethal injection on orders of Reza. This physician killed political prisoners under the guise of medical examinations, to make it appear that the victim died naturally. At time of death, Teymourtash was 50 years old. Four years later in 1937, Teymourtash‚Äòs close friend, Ali Akbar Davar died under mysterious circumstances. Rumors spread that Davar committed suicide after he was severely reprimanded and threatened by Reza Pahlavi two days earlier in private. Some newspapers wrote that he had died of a heart attack. Many suggest that his death had been related to his proposed American bill to Majlis with which British strongly opposed. Davar was 70 years old when he died.  Family  After Teymourtash's death, his extensive landholdings and other properties and possessions were confiscated by the Iranian government, while his immediate family was kept under house arrest on one of its farflung family estates for an extended period of time. While it was not uncommon for Reza Shah to imprison or kill his previous associates and prominent politicians, most notably Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh Farman Farmaian III and Sardar Asad Bakhtiar, the decision to impose severe collective punishment on Teymourtash's family was unprecedented. Immediate members of the Teymourtash family forced to endure seven years of house arrest and exile would consist of his mother and younger sister Badri Teymourtash, his first wife Sorour ol-Saltaneh and her four children, Manouchehr, Iran, Amirhoushang and Mehrpour. His second wife, Tatiana and her two young daughters, Parichehr and Noushi were spared house arrest. Having either just returned to Iran on account of their father's arrest, and informed by relatives to suspend their studies to Iran from Europe, the children would have to suffer the alleged sins of their father. Teymourtash's younger sister, Badri, had recently completed her studies in Belgium and upon her return to Iran in the early 1930s was likely the first female dentist in the country. Manouchehr, Teymourtash's eldest son was attending the world-renowned and foremost French military academy at √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France before his return, Iran was attending preparatory college in England, Amirhoushang was enrolled at the exclusive Harrow School in England, while Mehrpour was attending the venerated Le Rosey boarding school in Switzerland along with the then Crown Prince, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

Paritchehr and Noushi, Teymourtash's children from second wife The Teymourtash family remained in the seclusion of exile and was forbidden from receiving visitors until 1941 when Reza Shah was forced to abdicate after allied forces entered Iran during the early years of World War II. As part of the General Amnesty that followed Mohammad Reza Shah's accession to the throne that year, members of the Teymourtash family were released from exile and some of their confiscated properties were returned. Much like other extensive landholders in Iran, the tracts of land returned to the Teymourtash family would subsequently be subjected to the land reform and re-distribution schemes as part of the White Revolution introduced in the 1960s. Nonetheless, the Teymourtash family regained much of its wealth and was considered among the most affluent Iranian families before the Iranian Revolution of 1979. One noteworthy business transaction involved the sale of large tracts from the Teymourtash estates in Khorasan to industrialist Mahmoud Khayami to allow him develop an industrial complex several years before the Revolution.http://www.persianvillage.com/gala/nlstory.cfm?ID=73&NLID;=393 Mehrpour Teymourtash, who had been Mohammad Reza Shah's closest friend and classmate both during the period in which the two attended grade school in Tehran and subsequently at Le Rosey, was killed in a car accident shortly after the Teymourtash family was released from house arrest and exile in 1941. Prior to his demise, Mehrpour inaugurated a relationship with a Russian- Iranian linguist and ethnographer, Shahrbanu Shokuofova in Gilan. Although the marriage was never annulled, weeks after Mehrpour's accident Shahrbanu gives birth to a son in Khesmakh. In her journal she claims to have abdicated to British Raj following the Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran. Manouchehr Teymourtash followed in his father's footsteps and was elected a member of the Majles of Iran for several terms from Khorasan province. His marriage to Mahin Banoo Afshar led to the birth of Manijeh, and his second marriage to Touran Mansur, the daughter of former Iranian Prime Minister Ali Mansur (\\"Mansur ol Molk\\") resulted in the birth of Karimdad. After the revolution Manouchehr resided in California with his third wife, Akhtar Masoud the grand daughter of Prince Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan. Manouchehr's sole grandchild is Nargues (Nicky) Adle. Amirhoushang Teymourtash, on the other hand, resisted the temptation to pursue a political career and for the most part pursued entrepreneurial interests. Ervand Abrahamian describes Amirhoushang Teymourtash as an \\"enterprising aristocrat\\", and despite initially experiencing the vicissitudes of economic fluctuations, he proved particularly successful in his subsequent endeavours. In Princess Ashraf Pahlavi's candid memoirs, entitled Faces in a Mirror, and released after the Revolution, the Shah's sister reveals, \\"I was attracted to Houshang's tall good looks, his flamboyant charm, the sophistication he had acquired during his years at school in England. I knew that in this fun-loving, life-loving man I had found my first love\\". Although, Amirhoushang and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's young twin sister developed an affinity shortly after the former was released from house arrest in 1941, in an effort to cope with the death of Mehrpour, a long-term relationship was not pursued. Houshang's marriage to Forough Moshiri resulted in three children, Elaheh (\\"Lolo\\") Teymourtash-Ehsassi, Kamran, and Tanaz (\\"Nana\\"). Houshang's grandchildren consist of Marjan Ehsassi-Horst, Ali Ehsassi, Roxane Teymourtash-Owensby, Abteen Teymourtash and Amita Teymourtash. Houshang's great grandchildren consist of Sophie and Cyrus Horst, Laya Owensby and Kian Owensby, Dylan and Darian Teymourtash. Iran Teymourtash earned a Ph. d in literature while residing in France, and pursued a career in journalism. As with her father, she was awarded France's highest civilian honour, the Legion d'honneur. Apart from her brief engagement to Hossein Ali Qaragozlu, the grandson of Regent Naser ol Molk, from 1931 to 1932, Iran opted to remain single for the remainder of her life. Ironically, the posthumous release in 1991 of the Confidential Diary of Asadollah Alam, the Shah's closest confidant, revealed that Mohammad Reza Pahlavi intimated to Alam that during his late teenage years he \\"was head over heels in love with Iran Teymourtash\\". More recently, a book chronicling the lives of Iran Teymourtash, Ashraf Pahlavi and Mariam Firouz, entitled These Three Women (\\"Een Se Zan\\") and authored by Masoud Behnoud was published to wide acclaim in Iran. It is believed to be one of the best selling books to have been published in Iran in recent memory. Paritchehr and Noushie, Teymourtash's youngest children from his second wife Tatiana, were fortunate to not be compelled to endure the hardship of house arrest after their father's removal from office. Nonetheless after having been raised in Iran, they moved to New York along with their mother in the early 1940s. Paritchehr has pursued a distinguished career in classical dance, while Noushie was employed at the United Nations for several decades. After a brief engagement with future Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur, Noushie wedded Vincenzo Berlingeri which resulted in the birth of Andre and Alexei. Paritchehr is the sole surviving child of Abdolhossein Teymourtash, and is considered the custodian of her father's legacy to Iranian history.  Legacy  Essad Bey described Teymourtash as \\"a kaleidoscope in which all the colours of the new Iran intermingled\\" in the 1930s. However, the task of critically assessing his role in modern Iranian history was made unduly difficult after his death by concerted efforts during the Pahlavi era to obliviate any reference to the contributions of personalities, other than that of Reza Shah, who assisted in laying the foundations of modern Iran. More belatedly, after the overthrow of the Pahlavi regime and the advent of the Islamic Republic, the contributions of secular reformists such as Teymourtash have also been overlooked for obvious reasons. However, in 2004, the Iranian Cultural Heritage Department announced that it was earmarking money to renovate the homes of several of Iran's renowned modern political personalities such as Mohammad Mossadegh, Mohammad Taghi Bahar (\\"Malekol Sho'ara Bahar\\"), and Teymourtash. Given the shortcomings of rigorous Iranian historiography during the Pahlavi and post-revolutionary period, a more critical assessment of the role of the likes of Teymourtash may be gleaned from the dispatches that were recorded by diplomats resident in Iran at the time of his death. In his report to London shortly after Teymourtash's death, the British Minister in Tehran, Mallet, noted \\" The man who had done more than all others to create modern Persia ... was left by his ungrateful master without even a bed to die upon\\". \\"oblivion has swallowed a mouthful\\", the senior American diplomat in Tehran reported in his dispatch, \\"Few men in history, I would say, have stamped their personalities so indelibly on the politics of any country\\". In the concluding paragraph the American diplomat noted, \\"Albeit he had enemies and ardent ones, I doubt that anyone could be found in Persia having any familiarity with the deeds and accomplishments of Teymourtache who would gainsay his right to a place in history as perhaps the most commanding intellect that has arisen in the country in two centuries\\". A new generation of Iranian academics, however, have initiated a process of re- examining in a more objective light the contributions of numerous personalities that were previously treated in the most cursory fashion in Iranian historiography. One of the personalities whose legacy is being rehabilitated as a part of this process is Abdolhossein Teymourtash. Typical of the novel approach has been one of Iran's most pre-eminent historians, Javad Sheikholeslami, who recently unearthed much archival material which sheds light on the vast contributions of Teymourtash in the widest array of endeavours. Sheikholeslam concludes that Teymourtash should rightly be considered the Amir Kabir of 20th-century Iran, both for his zealous pursuit of much needed and far-reaching national reforms, as well as his steadfast refusal to compromise Iran's national or economic interests in his dealings with foreign governments. Apart from his undeniable political contributions, it remain to add, that Teymourtash's intellectual conceptions had a profound influence on the social and cultural landscape of modern Iran.

Her credits include The Hitch- Hiker, an original radio play written for Orson Welles and adapted for a notable episode of The Twilight Zone television series. Lucille Fletcher also wrote Sorry, Wrong Number, one of the most celebrated plays in the history of American radio, which she adapted and expanded for the 1948 film noir classic of the same name. Married to composer Bernard Herrmann in 1939, she wrote the libretto for his opera Wuthering Heights, which he began in 1943 and completed in 1951, after their divorce. BiographyEarly life= Violet Lucille Fletcher was born March 28, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were Matthew Emerson Fletcher, a marine draftsman for the Standard Ship Company (a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey), and Violet (Anderson) Fletcher.Lucille Fletcher Wallop in Contemporary Authors Online. Gale. August 1, 2001. Retrieved June 18, 2012. After attending Public School 164 and the Maxwell Training School, Fletcher went to Bay Ridge High School and became president of the Arista honor society and editor of the school magazine. At age 17 she was declared the champion student orator at the regional competition of the National Oratorical Contest on the Constitution of the United States, sponsored by The New York Times at The Town Hall May 17, 1929. The only female finalist in the New York zone, Fletcher received an all- expenses paid trip to South America, a gold medal, a cash prize of $1,000 and an opportunity to compete for the national championship.\\"Girl Orator Wins in Regional Finals. Lucille Fletcher of Bay Ridge High School Defeats Seven Boys at Town Hall.\\" The New York Times, May 18, 1929 Fletcher placed third in the national competition May 25, 1929, judged by five justices of the United States Supreme Court, with an address titled, \\"The Constitution: A Guarantee of the Personal Liberty of the Individual.\\"\\"National Oratory Won By Kansas City Boy.\\" The Joplin Globe, May 26, 1929\\"Missouri Boy First in Oratory Contest.\\" The New York Times, May 26, 1929 Fletcher attended Vassar College, where she earned a bachelor of arts degree with honors in 1933. =Career= From 1934 to 1939, Lucille Fletcher worked as a music librarian, copyright clerk and publicity writer at CBS. There she met her future husband, composer Bernard Herrmann, who conducted the CBS orchestra. The couple dated for five years, but delayed marriage due to her parents' objections. They finally married on October 2, 1939. Fletcher's first success came when one of her magazine stories, \\"My Client Curley,\\" was adapted for radio by Norman Corwin. Broadcast on the Columbia Workshop March 7, 1940, it was later adapted for the 1944 Cary Grant film, Once Upon a Time.Bernstein, Adam, \\"Lucille Fletcher Dies; Radio Suspense Writer\\"; The Washington Post, September 4, 2000 Herrmann wrote the score for the November 17, 1941, radio debut of Fletcher's famous story, The Hitch-Hiker on The Orson Welles Show. Fletcher's greatest success, Sorry, Wrong Number, premiered on May 25, 1943, as an episode of the radio series Suspense. Agnes Moorehead created the role in the first performance and again in several later radio productions. It was broadcast nationwide seven times between 1943 and 1948. Fletcher's daughter Dorothy Herrmann told The New York Times that Fletcher got the idea for Sorry, Wrong Number when she was buying food for her sick child at a local grocery on Manhattan's East Side, and a well-dressed woman with an obnoxious manner refused to allow Fletcher to go ahead of her in line. Herrmann described the drama as an \\"act of revenge\\". Barbara Stanwyck starred in the 1948 film version of Sorry, Wrong Number and, in 1952, performed the original radio play over the airwaves. A 1959 version produced for the CBS radio series Suspense received a 1960 Edgar Award for Best Radio Drama. Two operas were based on the play, which Orson Welles called \\"the greatest single radio script ever written\\". Fletcher adapted the first part of the Emily Bront√´ novel Wuthering Heights into a libretto for Bernard Herrmann's opera of the same name, conceived in 1943. He completed the opera in June 1951, by which time they had divorced. Fletcher said the opera was \\"perhaps the closest to his talent and heart.\\" The work was never produced on stage during Herrmann's lifetime. Fletcher is interviewed in the 1992 documentary, Music for the Movies: Bernard Herrmann, which was nominated for an Academy Award. =Personal life= Lucille Fletcher and Bernard Herrmann had two daughters, Wendy and Dorothy. The couple divorced in 1948, over his affair with her cousin Kathy Lucille (Lucy) Anderson. Anderson and Herrmann were married the following year. Fletcher married Douglass Wallop, a writer, on January 6, 1949. They remained married until his death in 1985. Lucille Fletcher died on August 31, 2000, after suffering a stroke.

It is black with metallic shine in nuances individually varying from a more common blue to a rarer bronze. It is distinguished from P. vitellinae by the latter more commonly displaying bronze nuances. The larvae undergo three instar stages from hatching to pupation.  Ecology  The blue willow beetle is found on aspen and various willow (Salix) species in fens, carrs and on river banks, but also often in willow short rotation coppice in agricultural landscapes. It often aggregates on host plants. On Salix cinerea, it prefers and is more common on female than male trees despite higher egg predation exerted by Anthocoris nemorum on the former. It is univoltine in Sweden but can produce multiple generations per year in other parts of its distribution range. Proliferation of larvae and egg production varies with vegetation. It overwinters under lichens on trees and under tree bark. Predators of blue willow beetle eggs are the common flowerbug (Anthocoris nemorum) and Orthotylus marginalis, and the adult is a vessel for larval development for the parasitoid wasp Perilitus brevicollis and the Vespoid wasp \\"Symmorphus bifasciatus\\".  The blue willow leaf beetle as a pest  In Europe, the blue willow beetle is the most severe herbivore on Willows. For plantations of common osier (Salix viminalis), herbivory reducing biomass production by up to 40% has been estimated .

He is the co-founder and president of Rockstar Games and one of the creative driving forces behind the games in the Grand Theft Auto franchise, being producer since the third game. He is responsible for taking GTA into the 3D-environment era, creating realistic cities under fully 3D-engines and turning the series into huge profits during video gaming's sixth-generation era. Early life Sam Houser was born in London in 1971. He is the son of solicitor Walter Houser and actress Geraldine Moffat, and brother to Dan Houser. Sam drew inspiration from crime films at an early age because his mother was an actor in that genre of film. As a child, The Getaway was Sam's main source of inspiration to become an aspiring \\"bank robber\\". Arcade games like Elite and Mr. Do! were Sam's favourite games growing up. Elite was a \\"space mugger\\" game according to Sam, allowing him to explore his \\"bad boy\\" side at an early age. Career Sam became a video producer for BMG Interactive after he and his father had lunch with the executive producer of the music label, who claimed that Houser had some good ideas. After BMG partnered with a small CD ROM company, Sam transferred to the Interactive Publishing division of BMG in order to work closely with developing video games. Credited as executive producer, Houser is also the creator of several of the games in the Grand Theft Auto series with his brother Dan. On Grand Theft Auto III his responsibilities were, in his words, to be \\"militant on ensuring the game had a look, a sound, a story and a feel that worked.\\" His description of the series as a whole is that the three sixth-generation Grand Theft Auto games form a \\"trilogy, [featuring] our distorted look at the East Coast around the time of the millennium (Grand Theft Auto III), followed by our reinterpretation of '80s Miami (Vice City), and lastly, our look at early-'90s California (San Andreas).\\" Despite their status as creators of Grand Theft Auto, one of the most successful video game franchises of all-time, Houser and his brother Dan have shied away from the media spotlight, focusing instead on the Rockstar Games brand, rather than any one person getting the credit for the games' success. In 2009, both Sam and Dan Houser appeared in Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2009 list. Houser also produced Max Payne 3 and Grand Theft Auto V.

The population was 170,481 in the 1999 census, rising to 210,590 in 2015. The city is located on the Nura River (the Samarkand Reservoir), northwest of Karaganda. History The first groups of settlers to settle in the area were 40 families from Samara (see Stolypin reform), who settled on the left bank of the Nura River on 15 June 1905. The settlement they founded was named Zhaur (–ñ–∞—É—Ä), after a hill on the other side of the river. In 1909 the settlement was renamed Samarkandsky (–°–∞–º–∞—Ä–∫–∞–Ω–¥—Å–∫–∏–π, or Samarkand for short). The first school and the first hospital were built in 1911. In 1933 the Samarkandsky- Karaganda water conduit was built to facilitate the development of the Karaganda coal field. In 1939 a dam () was constructed across the Nura River, creating the Samarkand water reservoir, which would remain until 1961. Construction of the Karaganda State Regional Electric Power Station began in 1934, and the first turbine came online in 1942. In 1944, despite being still under construction, the Kazakh Steel Mill yielded its first steel, smelted in an open-hearth Siemens-Martin furnace. The Samarkand settlement was granted city status on 1 October 1945, and renamed Temirtau (\\"Iron Mountain\\" in Kazakh). From 1947 to 1949 Japanese prisoners-of-war were kept in a camp near the town. In 1950 the Karaganda Steel Mill was founded. To build it the Soviet Union announced a \\"Nationwide High-Intensive Construction Project\\", and many young \\"shock-worker brigades\\" were brought from all over the Soviet Union and ally countries, including many from Bulgaria. In 1959 there were a series of riots and insurrections among the workers, who were highly dissatisfied with the poor working and living conditions and the interruptions in the supply of water, food, goods, tools and other resources as a result of mistakes by the administration. 16 workers were killed in the clashes, and 27 wounded, with 70 arrested and convicted. 28 police were also wounded in the fighting.–í–ï–ë–ï–†, –ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞. –í–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –≤ –¢–µ–º–∏—Ä—Ç–∞—É –≤ 1959 –≥–æ–¥—É: –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ—á–µ–≤–∏–¥—Ü–∞ (in Russian). –†–∞–¥–∏–æ –ê–∑–∞—Ç—Ç—ã–∫, 21.08.2010–ë–û–†–ò–°–û–í, –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π. –ö–∞–∫ –ø–æ–¥–∞–≤–ª—è–ª–∏ –≤ 1959 –≥–æ–¥—É —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–µ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –¢–µ–º–∏—Ä—Ç–∞—É. –û—á–µ–≤–∏–¥—Ü—ã –≤—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—é—Ç (in Russian). –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–ê–∑–∏—è, KZ - –°—Ä–µ–¥–∞, 03.08.2005–ê–°–¢–ê–®–ò–ù, –ù–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∞ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á. –¢–µ–º–∏—Ä—Ç–∞—É-1959: –æ–ø—ã—Ç —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-–≤–æ–π—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫ (in Russian). –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–∞–π—Ç ¬´–û–¢–í–ê–ì–ê¬ª, 28.02.2013 In 1960, blast furnace No. 1 yielded its first cast iron.History of Karaganda Metallurgical Works In 1963 the Karaganda Polytechnical Institute (now Karaganda Metallurgical Institute) was founded as a Higher Technical Educational Institution attached to the Karaganda Steel Mill. During the 1970s a new sports complex was built, including a 50m swimming pool, a 15,000 capacity stadium, and an indoor ice-skating and hockey rink. In 1972 the \\"Metallurgists' Palace of Culture\\" was opened in the town, followed in 1978 by the \\"Vostok\\" recreational park, situated in the eastern part of the city and opened to the public. On 29 July 1978 a Warrior Monument with an Eternal Flame was dedicated to the soldiers from Temirtau who had been killed in World War II. In 1984 a new residential area was developed, named Zenica in honour of Temirtau's twin-town of that name in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 1993 a new Winter Garden was added to Vostok Park. In 1995 the Karaganda Steel Mill was transferred to Ispat International, renamed Ispat-KarMet and eventually became the current Mittal Steel Temirtau, controlled by the ArcelorMittal group. In January 2018, black snow fell in the city near the plant, and local citizens complained that the pollution was caused by emissions from the plant. A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said that the discoloration of the snow was caused by a lack of wind, which would otherwise blow the pollution away. Sports Metallurg Stadium Temirtau sent a bandy team to the Winter Sports Tournaments in Karaganda. The town is home to FC Bolat football club, which plays in the Kazakhstan First Division.

ABS are formed when either two polymers, one polymer and one kosmotropic salt, or two salts (one chaotropic salt and the other a kosmotropic salt) are mixed at appropriate concentrations or at a particular temperature. The two phases are mostly composed of water and non volatile components, thus eliminating volatile organic compounds. They have been used for many years in biotechnological applications as non-denaturing and benign separation media. Recently, it has been found that ATPS can be used for separations of metal ions like mercury and cobalt, carbon nanotubes, environmental remediation, metallurgical applications and as a reaction media. Introduction In 1896, Beijerinck first noted an 'incompatibility' in solutions of agar, a water- soluble polymer, with soluble starch or gelatine. Upon mixing, they separated into two immiscible phases. Subsequent investigation led to the determination of many other aqueous biphasic systems, of which the polyethylene glycol (PEG) - dextran system is the most extensively studied. Other systems that form aqueous biphases are: PEG - sodium carbonate or PEG and phosphates, citrates or sulfates. Aqueous biphasic systems are used during downstream processing mainly in biotechnological and chemical industries. The two phases It is a common observation that when oil and water are poured into the same container, they separate into two phases or layers, because they are immiscible. In general, aqueous (or water-based) solutions, being polar, are immiscible with non-polar organic solvents (chloroform, toluene, hexane etc.) and form a two- phase system. However, in an ABS, both immiscible components are water-based. The formation of the distinct phases is affected by the pH, temperature and ionic strength of the two components, and separation occurs when the amount of a polymer present exceeds a certain limiting concentration (which is determined by the above factors). =PEG‚Äìdextran system= The \\"upper phase\\" is formed by the more hydrophobic polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is of lower density than the \\"lower phase,\\" consisting of the more hydrophilic and denser dextran solution. Although PEG is inherently denser than water, it occupies the upper layer. This is believed to be due to its solvent 'ordering' properties, which excludes excess water, creating a low density water environment. The degree of polymerization of PEG also affects the phase separation and the partitioning of molecules during extraction. Advantages ABS is an excellent method to employ for the extraction of proteins/enzymes and other labile biomolecules from crude cell extracts or other mixtures. Most often, this technique is employed in enzyme technology during industrial or laboratory production of enzymes. * They provide mild conditions that do not harm or denature unstable/labile biomolecules * The interfacial stress (at the interface between the two layers) is far lower (400-fold less) than water- organic solvent systems used for solvent extraction, causing less damage to the molecule to be extracted * The polymer layer stabilizes the extracted protein molecules, favouring a higher concentration of the desired protein in one of the layers, resulting in an effective extraction * Specialised systems may be developed (by varying factors such as temperature, degree of polymerisation, presence of certain ions etc. ) to favour the enrichment of a specific compound, or class of compounds, into one of the two phases. They are sometimes used simultaneously with ion-exchange resins for better extraction * Separation of the phases and the partitioning of the compounds occurs rapidly. This allows the extraction of the desired molecule before endogenous proteases can degrade them. * These systems are amenable to scale-ups, from laboratory- sized set-ups to those that can handle the requirements of industrial production. They may be employed in continuous protein-extraction processes. Specificity may be further increased by tagging ligands specific to the desired enzyme, onto the polymer. This results in a preferential binding of the enzyme to the polymer, increasing the effectiveness of the extraction. One major disadvantage, however, is the cost of materials involved, namely high- purity dextrans employed for the purpose. However, other low-cost alternatives such as less refined dextrans, hydroxypropyl starch derivatives and high-salt solutions are also available. Thermodynamic Modeling Besides the experimental study, it is important to have a good thermodynamic model to describe and predict liquid-liquid equilibrium conditions in engineering and design. To obtain global and reliable parameters for thermodynamic models usually, phase equilibrium data is suitable for this purpose. As there are polymer, electrolyte and water in polymer/salt systems, all different types of interactions should be taken into account. Up to now, several models have been used such as NRTL, Chen-NRTL, Wilson, UNIQUAC, NRTL-NRF and UNIFAC-NRF. It has been shown that, in all cases, the mentioned models were successful in reproducing tie-line data of polymer/salt aqueous two-phase systems. In most of the previous works, excess Gibbs functions have been used for modeling.

The tradition entails the use of an eponymous hobby horse which is made from a horse's skull mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that appears throughout Great Britain. The custom was first recorded in 1800, with subsequent accounts of it being produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry through the medium of song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink. Although the custom was given various names, it was best known as the Mari Lwyd; the etymology of this term remains the subject of academic debate. The folklorist Iorwerth C. Peate believed that the term meant \\"Holy Mary\\" and thus was a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, while fellow folklorist E. C. Cawte thought it more likely that the term had originally meant \\"Grey Mare\\", thus referring to the heads' equine appearance. A number of earlier folklorists to examine the topic, such as Peate and Ellen Ettlinger, believed that the tradition had once been a pre-Christian religious rite, although scholarly support for this interpretation has declined amid a lack of supporting evidence. The absence of late medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the various British hooded animal traditions‚Äîamong them the Hoodening of Kent, the Broad of the Cotswolds, and the Old Ball, Old Tup, and Old Horse of northern England‚Äîhave led to suggestions that they derive from the regionalised popularisation of the sixteenth and seventeenth- century fashion for hobby horses among the social elite. Although the tradition declined in the early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, in the work of the painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins. Description A Mari Lwyd, during a celebration in 2006 The Mari Lwyd itself consists of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; to the back of the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd. The Mari Lwyd custom was performed during winter festivities, specifically around the dates of Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which the custom was performed varied between villages, and in a number of cases the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season. The custom used to begin at dusk and often lasted late into the night. The Mari Lwyd party consisted of four to seven men, who often had coloured ribbons and rosettes attached to their clothes and sometimes wore a broad sash around the waist. There was usually a smartly dressed \\"Leader\\" who carried a staff, stick, or whip, and sometimes other stock characters, such as the \\"Merryman\\" who played music, and Punch and Judy (both played by men) with blackened faces; often brightly dressed, Punch carried a long metal fire iron and Judy had a besom. The Mari Lwyd party would approach a house and sing a song in which they requested admittance. The inhabitants of the house would then offer excuses for why the team could not enter. The party would sing a second verse, and the debate between the two sides - known as the pwnco - would continue until the house's inhabitants ran out of ideas, at which time they were obliged to allow the party entry and to provide them with ale and food. An account from Nantgarw described such a performance, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a noise, with Punch tapping the ground to the rhythm of the music and rapping on the door with a poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house walls, and windows with a broom. The householders had to make Punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered the building, otherwise it was the local custom that before he left he would rake out the fire with his poker. In the case from Llangynwyd, however, there was no interplay between the householders and troupe, but rather the latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing the first verse of their song. Once inside, the entertainment continued with the Mari Lwyd running around neighing and snapping its jaws, creating havoc, frightening children (and perhaps even adults) while the Leader pretended to try to restrain it. The Merryman played music and entertained the householders. The folklorist Iorwerth Peate believed that in recorded examples from Glamorgan it was apparent that the Mari Lwyd custom had become \\"indistinguishable\\" from the practice of wassailing, although added that there were still some examples of wassailing that did not involve the Mari Lwyd. He added that links between Mari Lwyd and wassailing were also apparent from recorded examples in other part of Wales, thus opining that Mari Lwyd represented a variant of the wider wassailing custom that was found throughout Britain. Early developmentEtymology= At the Chepstow Mari Lwyd, 2014 Most recorded sources term this particular custom Mari Lwyd. Jones considered this to be a translation of \\"Blessed Mary\\", and thus a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, a key religious figure in the Catholic Church. Although translating it slightly differently, as \\"Holy Mary\\", Peate endorsed this viewpoint. Although some of his acquaintances later suggested that the use of Mari for Mary was unknown in Wales prior to the Protestant Reformation, he countered these criticisms with the observation that the term Mari was being used in reference to the Virgin in the mid-14th century Black Book of Carmarthen, thus attesting to its early usage in Welsh. He nevertheless accepted that during the medieval period the term might have been restricted largely to poets, given that there is no evidence of its usage among the common dialect in this period. Given that llwyd is the usual word for \\"grey\\" in the Welsh language and that Welsh speakers would have been exposed to the English word \\"mare\\", an alternative suggestion considered by Peate was that the term Mari Lwyd had originally meant \\"Grey Mare\\". This etymological explanation would have parallels with the name of a similar hooded horse tradition found in Ireland and the Isle of Man, which is known in Irish as the L√°ir Bh√°n and in Manx as the Laare Vane, in both cases meaning \\"White Mare\\". Initially believing that \\"there is much to be said for this suggestion\\", Peate later embraced it fully. Cawte similarly believed that \\"Grey Mare\\" was the most likely original meaning of the term, noting that the Mari Lwyd appeared to represent a horse and that similar hobby horse customs in neighbouring England, such as the hoodening tradition of East Kent, also made reference to horses with their name. Peate suggested that even if the term Mari Lwyd had originally referred to a \\"Grey Mare\\", it could still have come to be associated with Mary in popular folk culture following the Reformation, thus explaining why Mary is referred to in the lyrics of some surviving Welsh wassailing songs. A further suggestion is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then the result would be merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea is that there is no known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country. In other recorded instances, the Mary Lwyd custom is given different names, with it being recorded as y Wasail \\"The Wassail\\" in parts of Carmarthenshire. In the first half of the 19th century it was recorded in Pembrokeshire under the name of y March \\"The Horse\\" and y Gynfas-farch \\"The Canvas Horse\\". One account from West Glamorgan has the head termed the aderyn bee [bi?] y llwyd, meaning the \\"Grey Magpie\\", although this may be due to an error on the part of the recorder, who could have confused the horse's head for the aderyn pica llwyd, an artificial bird in a tree that was carried by wassailers in the same area. Note that in modern Welsh, the Mari Lwyd is referred to with definite article y, which subsequently causes a soft mutation of m to f (), rendering the form y Fari Lwyd. =Origins= Positing the custom to be \\"the survival of some ancient popular rite or ceremony\\", in 1888 David Jones suggested that its origins were Christian, and that it had once been part of the festivities of the Feast of the Ass, a commemoration of the flight into Egypt of Mary and Saint Joseph that was historically marked on 14 January. According to Jones' idea, the Mari Lwyd itself represented the donkey on which Mary rode during the story. Peate was of the opinion that the Mari Lwyd was \\"no doubt a survival of a pre-Christian tradition\\" that had once been spread across Britain and other parts of Europe, and which - having survived the Christianisation of Britain - had been renamed Mari Lwyd in reference to the Virgin Mary during the Middle Ages. He expressed the view that the original custom had been \\"horrific in origin and intention\\" and that from an early date it had been connected to wassailing. Cawte concurred that it was \\"reasonable to accept\\" that the Mari Lwyd head had become attached to an independent wassailing tradition, but said that the connection to the Virgin Mary was unnecessary. Pearce also suggested the possibility that in parts of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire the Mari Lwyd tradition came under the influence of mystery plays, thus explaining why later recorded examples from those counties contained characters known as \\"the Sergeant\\" and the \\"Merryman\\". A Mari Lwyd at the 2013 St. David's Day festivities in Los Angeles. The folklorist Trefor M. Owen also suggested that the Mari Lwyd was a practice \\"which probably had a religious (if pre-Christian) origin\\", adding that by the time it had been recorded, it had become \\"emptied of its religious content\\". Also embracing Peate's suggestion of ancient origins, Ellen Ettlinger believed that the Mari Lwyd represented a \\"death horse\\", as symbolised by the white cloth worn by its carrier, suggesting that it was originally employed in a pre-Christian ritual to mark the festival of Samhain. The folklorist Christina Hole suggested that this \\"ancient character\\" was once \\"a bringer of fertility\\". However, after 1970 the folkloric trend for interpreting such hobby horse traditions as pre-Christian survivals had ended, as scholars came to express greater caution about proposing origins for such customs. The Mari Lwyd was part of a wider \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that the folklorist E. C. Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. A related example is the hoodening custom of East Kent in southeastern England. In an area along the border between Derbyshire and Yorkshire, the Old Tup tradition featured groups knocking on doors around Christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat's head. Hole drew parallels between hoodening and the Christmas Bull tradition recorded in Dorset and Gloucestershire. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions‚Äîthe Padstow 'Obby 'Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse‚Äîwhich take place not at Christmas time but on May Day. Although the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \\"nation-wide craze\\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \\"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\\". Regional coverage Modern painting of the Mari Lwyd In mapping the distribution of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds of instances falling within that county. The custom stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account is also one of the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the custom with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas. Cawte opined that there was \\"no clear reason\\" for the distribution of the Mari Lwyd custom, which cut through various local cultural features. Those areas where it was found did not correlate with any distinction between English-speaking and Welsh-speaking areas in South Wales. He acknowledged however that there was a \\"reasonable correspondence\\" between the areas in which the Mari Lwyd was recorded and the areas which were used for mineral production in the 14th century. He therefore suggested the possibility that it might have been performed by coal and iron miners in western Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, and western Monmouthshire, and that from there it could have spread into those villages where goods were manufactured using those minerals. Recorded appearances18th and 19th centuries= The earliest published account of the Mari Lwyd appeared in 1800 in J. Evans' A Tour through Part of North Wales, in the year 1798, and at Other Times. Although the book itself focused on North Wales, the chapter in which the passage was included discussed the language and customs of Wales more generally. In this section, Evans related that: :A man on new year's day, dressing himself in blankets and other trappings, with a factitious head like a horse, and a party attending him, knocking for admittance, this obtained, he runs about the room with an uncommon frightful noise, which the company quit in real or pretended fright; they soon recover, and by reciting a verse of some cowydd, or, in default, paying a small gratuity, they gain admission. Evans returned to the custom in his 1804 work Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times. Here he provided a clearer discussion than before, making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured the local area from Christmas until after Twelfth Day, and that they were given food or money to leave the householders alone. The Mari Lwyd next appeared in an 1819 account from West Glamorgan, where the Mari Lwyd itself was termed an Aderyn Bee y llwyd (roughly \\"Grey Magpie\\") and was accompanied by \\"three or four partners in the profits of the expedition, who are by turns horse, groom, or attendants\\". It has been suggested that the Welsh Methodist revival contributed to the decline of both the Mari Lwyd and a number of other Welsh folk customs. In 1802, the harpist Edward Jones of Merionethshire published a book in which he lamented the destructive impact that Christian preachers were having on Welsh folk customs, which they were criticising as sinful. In his view, \\"the consequence is, Wales, which was formerly one of the merriest and happiest countries in the World, is now becoming one of the dullest\\". Reflecting such a view, in 1852 the Reverend William Roberts, a Baptist minister at Blaenau Gwent, condemned the Mari Lwyd and other related customs as \\"a mixture of old Pagan and Popish ceremonies... I wish of this folly, and all similar follies, that they find no place anywhere apart from the museum of the historian and antiquary.\\" Owen suggested that the custom's decline was also a result of changing social conditions in South Wales. He argued that the Mari Lwyd wassailing custom \\"gave an approved means of entering the houses of neighbours in a culture in which there were few public assemblies - at least in the heart of winter - in which the convivial spirit of the season could be released\\". Further, he suggested that the gifts of food, drink, and sometimes money \\"no doubt helped to further the feeling of community among country folk while at the same time manifesting it\\". He argued that the changing social conditions altered the ways that people in southern Wales celebrated Christmas, hence contributing to the folk custom's decline. =20th century revival= In a 1935 article on the subject of the Mari Lwyd, Peate stated that the tradition \\"is still met with; it is practised in the Cardiff district, Bridgend, Llangynwyd, Neath and other Glamorgan districts\\". He highlighted an example from Christmas Eve 1934, in which a Mari Lwyd was observed performing alongside at least twelve singers in a chemist's shop in the Mumbles, Swansea. Ettlinger subsequently expressed the view that \\"Dr. Peate deserves the sincerest gratitude of all folk-lore students for having so valiantly penetrated the mysteries surrounding the Mari Lwyd.\\" Footage of a pwnco on the steps of Chepstow Museum in 2014 The historian Ronald Hutton stated that the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In the middle of that century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmarthenshire. During the 1980s, further revived forms of the Mari Lwyd tradition emerged in Caerphilly, Llantrisant, and St Fagans, all of which are in the same borderland between Vale and mountains. Commenting on the example of Llantrisant, which was inaugurated in 1980, Mick Tems noted that the custom had \\"re-established herself so strongly that there are complaints if she misses any of her regular calls\\". He noted that in 1991 the Llantrisant Mari Lwyd was taken to Yn Chruinnaght, a Pan-Celtic festival on the Isle of Man, and that it had also been taken to the Lowender Peran festival at Perranporth in Cornwall. Hutton believed that the custom re-emerged in the borderlands between Vale and the mountains in part because people in Glamorgan sought to reaffirm their sense of cultural identity during the termination of their traditional industries, and partly because the Welsh Folk Museum was located in the area. More widely, he believed that the revival of the Mari Lwyd was in large part due to the \\"forces of local patriotism\\", noting that a similar situation had resulted in the resurrection of the hoodening tradition in East Kent. The town council of Aberystwyth organised \\"The World's Largest Mari Lwyd\\" for the Millennium celebrations in 2000. A mixture of the Mari Lwyd and Wassail customs occurs in the border town of Chepstow, South Wales, every January. A band of English Wassailers meet with the local Welsh Border Morris Side, The Widders, on the bridge in Chepstow. In culture The Mari Lwyd has prompted responses from the arts in Wales. The poet Vernon Watkins published his \\"Ballad of the Mari Lwyd\\" in 1941. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has written that this, \\"one of the outstanding poems of the century, draws together the folk-ritual of the New Year, the Christian Eucharist, the uneasy frontier between living and dead, so as to present a model of what poetry itself is ‚Äî frontier work between death and life, old year and new, bread and body.\\" The Mari Lwyd was utilised by the artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins in a series of drawings from around 2000 that focused on a metamorphosing horse/man as a nightmarish harbinger of his father's death. Catriona Urquhart wrote a sequence of poems titled The Mare's Tale which were published alongside Hicks-Jenkins' images in 2001. In her 1977 novel Silver on the Tree, the author Susan Cooper included an appearance from the Mari Lwyd.Cooper, Susan (1977). Silver on the Tree. London: Chatto and Windus. Related Welsh customs In 1919, H. W. Evans recorded the existence of a similar custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire circa 1840, during his mother's childhood. He stated that this custom entailed the use of what he termed a \\"Mari Lwyd\\", furthermore providing a drawing of it using his mother's recollections as a basis, although was unaware of how this costume had been used. According to Evans' description, this Mari Lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone, which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears, thus resembling an animal's snout. An individual could conceal themselves under the sheet and use a hay fork inserted into the hay to hold it up. A similar custom appears in an account from 1897, in which an entity known as the Bwca Llwyd (\\"Grey Bogy\\") was described; it involved an imitation horse's head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay, being carried about using a hay fork on All Hallow's Eve. Cawte also noted the example of other Welsh folk customs featuring the head of a horse, however he opined that these \\"so not seem to be closely related to the mari lwyd\\". A horse's head was prepared in a manner akin to the Mari Lwyd for a spring festival known as the mynwenta or pynwenta, which took place in Pembrokeshire circa 1820. As part of this festival, young men and women gathered at a mill for a night's entertainment. In the late nineteenth century, a tradition was recorded in North Wales that was known as \\"giving a skull\\", in which the skull of a horse or donkey was placed over the front door of a woman's house on May Day as a sign of contempt. In parts of Wales a horse's head - sometimes with horns attached - was featured as part of the charivari processions designed to shame those who were deemed to have behaved in an immoral manner.

It was originally designed by Austrian firm B√∂hler, and produced in Italy under license. The Cannone da 47/32 was used both as an infantry gun and an anti-tank gun; it was highly effective against light to medium armored tanks.  History  47/32 M35. AB 41 with 47/32. The Austrian firm of B√∂hler originally designed and manufactured the gun. In the 1930s Italy bought some of these guns from B√∂hler, and then began to produce the weapon under license, continuing its development. The Cannone da 47/32 M35 was the main armament in the M13/40 medium tank, the M14/41 medium tank, and experimentally on the AB 41 armored car (see photograph), and the 47/32 self- propelled gun. The 47/32 was built in two versions, the first with semi- pneumatic disk wheels, and the second (in 1939, from which the name 47/32 mod. 39) with improved barrel and suspension (in some series also light-alloy wheels with semi-pneumatic tires). To tow this piece, the Fiat-OCI 708 CM tractor and the L3 tankette were used, but these projects were soon abandoned as the gun was subjected to breaking at the axles spindles and shanks. Due to its shape, the 47/32 was commonly called \\"elefantino\\" (little elephant) by the troops. The 47/32 was primarily an anti-tank gun but was also used as a close support weapon. In 1940 it was nonetheless an adequate weapon: it had roughly the same degree of armor penetration of its contemporaries (like the British 2-pounder gun, the German PaK 36 and the Soviet 45 mm gun, outperformed the French 25 mm gun), and its HE shell was at least successful (while the 2-Pounder was limited to the anti-tank role). Its major drawbacks were the inadequacy of the gun to be towed by truck, and the lack of a gun shield. The failure of the Italian Army to produce and deploy a more powerful gun in numbers meant that by 1942 the 47/32 gun was still seeing frontline service despite being ineffective against the heavier tanks it had to face. For use in the M15/42 tank the 47/32 gun was redesigned with a longer L/40 barrel and an enlarged ammunition chamber. The larger amount of propellant combined with the longer barrel greatly increased the armour penetration capability of the 47/40 gun.

An internal node of a phylogenetic tree is described as a polytomy or multifurcation if (i) it is in a rooted tree and is linked to three or more child subtrees or (ii) it is in an unrooted tree and is attached to four or more branches. A tree that contains any multifurcations can be described as a multifurcating tree. Soft polytomies vs. hard polytomies Two types of polytomies are recognised, soft and hard polytomies.Purvis, A., and T. Garland, Jr. 1993. Polytomies in comparative analyses of continuous characters. Systematic Biology 42:569‚Äì575. Soft polytomies are the result of insufficient phylogenetic information: though the lineages diverged at different times ‚Äì meaning that some of them are closer relatives than others ‚Äì the available data does not allow recognition of this. Most polytomies are soft, meaning that they would be resolved into a typical tree of dichotomies if better data were available. In contrast, a hard polytomy represents a true divergence event of three or more lineages.  Applications  Interpretations for a polytomy depend on the individuals, that are represented in the phylogenetic tree. = Species Polytomies = If the lineages in the phylogenetic tree stand for species, a polytomy shows the simultaneous speciation of three or more species. In particular situations they may be common, for example when a species that has rapidly expanded its range or is highly panmictic undergoes peripatric speciation in different regions. An example is the Drosophila simulans species complex. Here, the ancestor seems to have colonized two islands at the same time but independently, yielding two equally old but divergently evolved daughter species = Molecular Polytomies = If a phylogenetic tree is reconstructed from DNA sequence data of a particular gene, a hard polytomy arises when three or more sampled genes trace their ancestry to a single gene in an ancestral organism. In contrast, a soft polytomy stems from branches on gene trees of finite temporal duration but for which no substitutions have occurred. Recognizing hard polytomies As DNA sequence evolution is usually much faster than evolution of complex phenotypic traits, it may be that genetic lineages diverge a short time apart from each other, while the actual organism has not changed if the whole ancestral population is considered. Since few if any individuals in a population are genetically alike in any one population ‚Äì especially if lineage sorting has not widely progressed ‚Äì it may be that hard polytomies are indeed rare or nonexistent if the entire genome of each individual organism is considered, but rather widespread on the population genetical level if entire species are considered as interbreeding populations (see also species concept). \\"Speciation or lineage divergence events occurring at the same time\\" refers to evolutionary time measured in generations, as this is the only means that novel traits (e.g. germline point mutations) can be passed on. In practical terms, the ability to distinguish between hard and soft polytomies is limited: if for example a kilobase of DNA sequences which mutate approximately 1% per million years is analysed, lineages diverging from the same ancestor within the same 100,000 years cannot be reliably distinguished as to which one diverged first. Founder effects and genetic drift may result in different rates of evolution. This can easily confound molecular clock algorithms to the point where hard polytomies become unrecognizable as such.

Stoke Orchard was formerly home to the Coal Research Establishment of the National Coal Board, which moved onto the site of a Ministry for Aircraft Production shadow factory run by the Gloster Aircraft Company adjacent to RAF Stoke Orchard. At one point the famous aviatrix Amy Johnson lived in the village. The CRE site has now been demolished, the site cleared and it has been developed by Bloor Homes having built 145 houses, a state-of-the-art community centre, a village Shop and a multi-use all-weather sports pitch. This development has effectively doubled the size of the village. Stoke Orchard is in the borough of Tewkesbury, the Cheltenham post town, and on the Coombe Hill, Cheltenham, telephone exchange. Stoke Orchard neighbours Elmstone-Hardwicke, Tredington and Bishop's Cleeve. Politically the village is twinned with neighbouring Tredington, as Stoke Orchard parish. The two villages are part of a large church parish with two other villages nearer to the River Severn. Stoke Orchard, in common with many villages in this part of Gloucestershire, has a sizeable church but no pubs. There is now a modern, eco-friendly community centre, with a community convenience shop attached called The Orchard Stores. The community centre is a fully self supporting building, which generates income through providing a great space for various classes, event days and parties, and recently won a national award from Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) for the most ecologically-friendly village hall in the country. The church has early wall paintings of the life of St James - revealed when the whitewash applied at the time of the English Reformation was removed, and it was a staging post on the route for pilgrims making their way to Santiago de Compostela. Tredington Primary School was built halfway between Stoke and Tredington in order to serve both communities. Stoke Orchard is aligned with nearby Tredington to form the Parish of Stoke Orchard. The Parish Council, composed of local community volunteers, meets once per month, and is aligned with Tewkesbury Borough Council. The parish of Stoke Orchard had a population of 435 according to the 2011 census.

He and his brother Charles, both members of the James‚ÄìYounger Gang under James‚Äôs leadership, went on to perform paid re√´nactments of the killing at publicity events. Ford would spend his later years operating multiple saloons and dance halls across the West. Ten years after James's assassination, Ford was himself the victim of a fatal shot to the neck by Edward Capehart O'Kelley in Creede, Colorado, passing away at only 30 years old. While initially buried in Creede, his remains were later exhumed and re√Ønterred in his hometown of Richmond, Missouri. Early years Robert Ford was born in 1862 in Ray County, Missouri to James Thomas and Mary Bruin Ford as the youngest of seven siblings. As a young man, Ford came to admire Jesse James for his Civil War record and criminal exploits, eventually getting to meet him in 1880 at the age of 18. Ford's brother Charles is believed to have taken part in the James-Younger gang's Blue Cut train robbery in Jackson County, west of Glendale, Missouri (renamed Selsa and now part of Independence), on September 7, 1881.  Joining the Gang  In November 1881, after the train robbery, James moved his family to St. Joseph, Missouri and intended to give up crime. The James gang had been greatly reduced in numbers by that time; some had fled the gang in fear of prosecution, and many of the original members were either dead or in prison after a botched bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota. After the train robbery, James‚Äôs brother Frank James had also decided to retire from crime and moved East, settling in Lynchburg, Virginia. By the spring of 1882, with his gang depleted by arrests, deaths and defections, James thought that he could trust only the Ford brothers. Charles had been out on raids with James before, but Bob was an eager new recruit. The Fords resided in St. Joseph with the James family, where Jesse went by the alias Thomas Howard. Hoping to keep the gang alive, James invited the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City Bank in Missouri, but the brothers had already decided not to participate; rather, they intended to collect the $10,000 bounty placed on James by Governor Thomas T. Crittenden. In January 1882, Bob Ford and gang member Dick Liddil had surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at their sister Martha Bolton's residence in Ray County. They were brought into a meeting with Crittenden, as they had been around James‚Äôs cousin Wood Hite the day Hite was murdered. Crittenden promised Ford a full pardon if he would kill James, who was by then the most wanted criminal in the USA. Crittenden had made capturing the James brothers his top priority; in his inaugural address he declared that no political motives could be allowed to keep them from justice. Barred by law from offering a sufficiently large reward, he had turned to the railroad and express corporations to put up a $5,000 bounty for the delivery of each of them and an additional $5,000 for the conviction of either of them. Living with the James‚ÄôS family, the Fords became part of the daily routine, and James‚Äôs wife cooked for them. They were nervous and bored, looking for opportunity, and feeling restless. The confession of Liddil to participating in Hite‚Äôs murder made the news, and pressure began to build around James. Killing Jesse James On April 3, 1882 Jesse James stepped up on a chair to dust a picture, and Robert Ford seized the opportunity and shot James in the back of the head. Jesse James' home in St. Joseph, Missouri, where Ford assassinated James in 1882 On April 3, 1882, after eating breakfast, the Fords and James went into the living room before travelling to Platte City. By reading the daily newspaper, James had just learned of gang member Liddil's confession for participating in Hite's murder and grew increasingly suspicious of the Fords for never reporting this matter to him. According to Robert Ford, it became clear to him that James had realized they were there to betray him. However, instead of scolding the Fords, James walked across the living room to lay his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantel, and stood on a chair in order to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon and shot James in the back of the head. After the killing, the Fords wired Crittenden to claim their reward. They surrendered themselves to legal authorities but were dismayed to be charged with first degree murder. In one day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging, but two hours later Crittenden granted them a full pardon.  Later Years  Public opinion turned against the Fords for betraying their gang leader, and Bob was seen as a coward and traitor for killing James. This sentiment clashed with the general public opinion at the time of James‚Äôs death that it had been time for James to be stopped by any means. For a period, Bob earned money by posing for photographs as \\"the man who killed Jesse James\\" in dime museums. He also appeared on stage with his brother Charles, reenacting the murder in a touring stage show. Charles, terminally ill with tuberculosis and addicted to morphine, committed suicide on May 4, 1884. Soon afterward, Bob Ford and Dick Liddil relocated to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they opened a saloon. According to legend, Ford had a shooting contest with Jose Chavez y Chavez, a comrade-in-arms of Billy the Kid's during the Lincoln County War. Ford lost the contest and left town. On December 26, 1889, Ford survived an assassination attempt in Kansas City, Kansas when an assailant tried to slit his throat. Within a few years, Ford settled in Colorado, where he opened a saloon-gambling house in Walsenberg. When silver was found in Creede, Ford closed his saloon and opened one there.Rocky Mountain News, March 7, 1892, p.2. Ford purchased a lot and on May 29, 1892 opened Ford's Exchange, said to have been a dance hall. Six days later, the entire business district, including Ford's Exchange, burned to the ground in a major fire. Ford opened a tent saloon until he could rebuild. Death Edward Capehart O'Kelley . Three days after the fire, on June 8, 1892, Edward O'Kelley entered Ford's tent saloon with a shotgun. According to witnesses, Ford's back was turned. O'Kelley said, \\"Hello, Bob.\\" As Ford turned to see who it was, O'Kelley fired both barrels, killing Ford instantly. O'Kelley hence became \\"the man who killed the man who killed Jesse James\\". O'Kelley's sentence was commuted because of a 7,000-signature petition in favor of his release and a medical condition, and he was released on October 3, 1902. O'Kelley was subsequently killed on January 13, 1904 while trying to shoot a policeman. Ford was buried in Creede. His remains were later moved and reinterred at Richmond Cemetery in his native Richmond in Ray County, Missouri; \\"The man who shot Jesse James\\" was inscribed on his grave marker. Cultural depictionsFilms= The James and Ford brothers were popular subjects of Western films in the 1940s and 1950s: *In Jesse James (1939), Ford is played by John Carradine. *In The Return of Frank James (1940), a highly fictionalized film about Frank James hunting down Bob and Charley Ford, John Carradine reprised his role. The film, directed by Fritz Lang, is a sequel to Jesse James, which also features the Fords. *In I Shot Jesse James (1949), directed by Samuel Fuller, Ford is portrayed by John Ireland. *In The Great Missouri Raid (1951), directed by Gordon Douglas, Ford is portrayed by Whit Bissell. *In The True Story of Jesse James (1957), Ford is portrayed by Carl Thayler. *In Hell's Crossroads (1957), Robert Vaughn plays Bob Ford. *In The Long Riders (1980), Nicholas and Christopher Guest play Bob and Charley Ford. *In the made-for-TV movie The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James (1986), Bob Ford was played by Darrell Wilks. The role of Jesse is played by Kris Kristofferson, Frank James is played by Johnny Cash. Willie Nelson and Jerry Lee Lewis also have roles in this film. *In Frank & Jesse (1995), Jim Flowers plays Bob Ford. *In The Plot to Kill: Jesse James (2006), and Jesse James: American Outlaw (2007) (both TV movies produced by The History Channel), Ford is portrayed by James Horton. *In The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), based on the historical novel by Ron Hansen, Ford is played by Casey Affleck, with Brad Pitt as Jesse James. Affleck was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. =Literature= *Ron Hansen's historical novel, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (1983), is based on deep research of the figures and their times. *In Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's novel Inferno (1976), Ford is depicted as being in Hell as a traitor. =Music= *The lyrics of the folk song \\"Jesse James\\" (first recorded in 1924 and later recorded by others, such as The Kingston Trio, Bruce Springsteen and The Pogues) refer to Ford as \\"Well it was Robert Ford/that dirty little coward/I wonder now how he feels/for he ate of Jesse's bread/and he slept in Jesse's bed/and he laid poor Jesse in his grave.\\" *In the Bob Dylan song \\"Outlaw Blues\\", Dylan alludes to Ford with the lines, \\"I ain't gonna hang no picture/Ain't gonna hang no picture frame/Well I might look like a Robert Ford/But I feel just like a Jesse James\\". *Elton John's song \\"I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)\\", from the Rock of the Westies (1975) album, refers to a betrayal in a romantic relationship that is metaphorically likened to Jesse James' assassin. *In Warren Zevon's song \\"Frank and Jesse James\\", Ford is noted in the lyrics, \\"Robert Ford, a gunman/In exchange for his parole/Took the life of James the outlaw/Which he snuck up on and stole\\". *In The Sugarhill Gang's song \\"Apache\\", Ford is referenced in the lyrics, \\"My tribe went down in the Hall of Fame/'Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James\\". *In song by Australian singer-songwriter Dave Graney, ‚ÄòRobert Ford On The Stage‚Äô, from Graney's 1989 Album, ‚ÄòMy Life On The Plains‚Äô (Dave Graney With The White Buffaloes). Graney's song is a potent evocation of Ford's tortured psychological state after he killed the notorious Jesse James. The song weaves a haunting narrative, mixing references to the closing moments of an imaginary Australian Rules Football match, and the bizarre stage-show created by Ford and his brother, which toured the countryside, enacting the infamous assassination. =Radio= *Sam Edwards portrayed Bob Ford in the CBS radio show Crime Classics episode, The Death of a Picture Hanger (July 20, 1953). =Television series= *Tyler MacDuff played Bob Ford in the episode \\"Jesse and Frank James\\" of Jim Davis's syndicated Stories of the Century. *Bobby Jordan played Ford in an episode of Dale Robertson's NBC series Tales of Wells Fargo. *Martin Landau portrayed Robert Ford in the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Lawman in the episode \\"The Outcast\\". *Charles Aidman guest starred in the episode \\"Bob Ford\\" in the first season of Shotgun Slade, starring Scott Brady. *Roy Jenson played Bob Ford in the Hondo episode \\"Hondo and the Judas\\". *In the NCIS episode \\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\", DiNozzo references Ford when Ducky opines that the person he autopsied being shot in the back was \\"a cowardly act\\". *The Little House on the Prairie episode \\"The Aftermath\\" depicted Ford as a student at Walnut Grove School. *Westworld featured a character named Robert Ford, played by Anthony Hopkins, who was the architect of the park, and the primary antagonist of the first season. *Timeless featured an alternate timeline where Garcia Flynn shoots and kills Robert and Charley Ford moments before they shoot Jesse James, played by Daniel Lissing. James then helps Flynn locate another member of the future lost in time, pursued by the real-life versions of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. ReferencesFurther reading * Ries, Judith.

Distribution and habitat The dwarf gourami is native to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. However, it has also been widely distributed outside of its native range. It inhabits slow-moving waters in rivulets, streams and lakes, occurring in areas with plentiful vegetation. Appearance and anatomy This species can reach a length of TL. Male dwarf gouramis in the wild have diagonal stripes of alternating blue and red colors; females are a silvery color. Besides the difference in color, the sex can be determined by the dorsal fin. The male's dorsal fin is pointed, while the female's is rounded or curved. They carry touch-sensitive cells on their thread-like pelvic fins. Dwarf gouramis sold in fish stores may also be solid colors (e.g., powder blue dwarf gourami or red flame variety) which are nothing but captive bred color morphs of the same species. In the aquarium A female dwarf gourami with two males in an aquarium Most dwarf gouramis live for about four to six years; with proper care, they can live longer. Dwarf gouramis are generally peaceful fish‚Äîunlike the much larger standard gourami, which can become aggressive. Dwarf gouramis do well in most community aquariums and are compatible with most fish, such as Platies, Mollies, Plecostomus, Ghost Catfish, Tetras, and other docile fish. They require a tank that can hold at least ten gallons. They are usually found swimming in the middle or top regions of the aquarium, because Gouramis are labyrinth fish and make use of their labyrinth organ if necessary. Dwarf gouramis do not do well with large, aggressive fish. Dwarf gouramis are so docile that they will allow themselves to be bullied to death rather than fight back. Males of other gourami species, as well as male Siamese fighting fish, may attack dwarf gouramis. When a tank contains a Dwarf gourami and faster swimming top swimmers like guppies, food should be dropped in a more spread out area so that the Dwarf gourami has a higher chance to snatch the food before the other fish since Dwarf gouramis are timid fish. Dwarf gouramis tolerate fairly high temperatures. Temperatures of are easily tolerated. Dwarf gouramis raised for aquarium trade in Singapore may carry dwarf gourami iridovirus. Recent research has shown that 22% of Singapore Trichogaster lalius carry this virus. =Nutrition= Female dwarf gourami feeding on commercial fish food A varied diet is very important to the dwarf gourami, which is an omnivore that prefers both algae-based foods and meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and brine shrimp, will provide these fish with proper nutrition. =Signs of Stress and/or Sickness= Usually when a Dwarf gourami is stressed or sick, then it will sulk around at the bottom of your tanks, and will refuse food as most other types of fish. Also the Dwarf gourami will not be as colorful as if it were healthy. =Breeding= The male builds a floating bubble nest in which the eggs are laid. Unlike other bubble nest builders, males will incorporate bits of plants, twigs, and other debris, which hold the nest together better. The water level should be reduced to during spawning, and the temperature should be approximately 28-. Vegetation is essential, as males build their bubble nest using plant material, which they bind together with bubbles. Nests are very elaborate and sturdy, reaching several inches across and an inch deep. Limnophila aquatica, Riccia fluitans, Ceratopteris thalictroides, and Vesicularia dubyana, are good choices for the breeding tank. Peat fiber may also be offered as building material. Once the nest has been built the male will begin courting the female, usually in the afternoon or evening. He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Dwarf gouramis have a fecundity of about 600 eggs.[1] Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest. The male will protect the eggs and fry. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch, and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free swimming and leave the nest. When the fry are two to three days old the male should also be removed or he may consume the young. After spawning the female should be moved to a different tank. The male will now take sole responsibility for the eggs, aggressively defending the nest and surrounding territory. When first hatched, the tiny fry should be fed infusoria, and later, brine shrimp and finely ground flakes. Freeze-dried tablets may also be fed to older fry. =Colour variations= Breeders have created different colour variations, principally varying proportions of red and blue colouring. The powder blue variant is almost entirely bright blue. The reddest variety (flame red) can be confused with the red variety of honey gouramis (Trichogaster chuna). One of the most common color morphs is the turquoise / neon blue, featuring stripes of dark red and bright blue.

Cabana is the capital of both the Cabana District and the Province of Pallasca. Cabana was founded on January 2, 1857, although human habitation there likely predates arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors. The city is divided into four neighborhoods: *Huayumaca *Pacchamaca *San Jer√≥nimo *Trujillo History Cabana was founded in 1711 with the name of \\"Caguana\\" which means \\"To repair\\" or \\"to contemplate\\" in the Cully Language (former language of this region)according to an old leyend. When the Spanish conquerors arrived to Caguana, the name was mispronounced and started to say \\"Cabana\\" instead of Caguana. Cabana was officially created by the Provisional Regulations on February 12, 1821 and then comprised to the vast province of Conchucos. Cabana was elevated to the level of district on December 2, 1856 under the Presidency of Don Don Ram√≥n Castilla. Then in 1861 the province of Conchucos was divided into two provinces: Pallasca and Pomabamba, the first with its capital Corongo and the second with its capital Pomabamba. On October 30, 1901, Cabana was elevated by law in the Capital of the province of Pallasca, this Act also gave him the title of \\"Villa\\" and on November 18, 1914 obtained the rank of City under Law No. 2631, a proposal of Priest Teodoro Gonzales Melendez and identified by Congressman Don Fausto Valdeavellano. On January 26, 1943, by Act No. 9821 the Pallasca province was divided into two provinces: Pallasca with its capital Cabana and Corongo with its capital Corongo city. This law rules until today's days. Cabana is one of the 11 districts that conforms the province of Pallasca in the Ancash Region. It limits the north with the districts of Bolognesi and the Huandoval, the east and the south with the province of Corongo and the west with the district of Tauca. Traditions and FestivitiesEaster= Easter is celebrated in Cabana similar to the festivities in Ayacucho, Peru. Easter is celebrated for an entire week. Starting on Palm Sunday in which the Cabanistas recall the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem sitting on a donkey. On Holy Wednesday, the statues of Jesus and Maria are taken out in procession, recalling the famous encounter between these two religious characters. On Holy Thursday, after Mass, where the priest wash the feet to the brotherhood members of Holy Thursday, the statue of Jesus crucified is taken out in procession. Good Friday at 3 pm the cabanistas recall the death of Jesus and later in the night the image of Jesus in his coffin is taken out in procession. On Holy Saturday the image of Jesus alive is taken out in procession =Santiago Apostle Festivities= The festivities in honor of Santiago Apostle is celebrated in two weeks in July each year. Starting July 16 and ends on July 25, the Central day. The festivities in honor of the Santiago Apostle, are probably the most important festivities celebrated in Cabana. For two weeks thousands of people come to Cabana from all over the world to be witness and enjoy the food, dances and all that Cabana offers to its visitors. During these festivities, people in Cabana don't have time to rest. There is music all day long that goes until 4 or 5 in the morning. Visitors can find food and beverages for free during this festivities. For two weeks people dance in honor of Santiago Apostle but on July 24 and July 25, people in Cabana attend mass and procession of Santiago Apostle for the streets of Cabana. This festivity is also celebrated in Chimbote, Lima and in different cities in the United States of America =The Anniversary= On October 30, Cabana celebrates its anniversary as the capital of the Province of Pallasca, Ancash, Peru. Different activities related to this celebration are performed. Dances They represent past events as a tribute to the beliefs, desires and reflections of a people, we would say that dances update the story of a place and its inhabitants. In the Andean world dances are preserved from centuries old. Cabana pays tribute to the Patron Santiago Apostle with colorful dances, among them are: The Mojiganga, The Blanquillos and The Kiyayas; each of them with varied components between choreography, costumes, songs, music and interpretation. =The Mojiganga= Castilian word that means jocoso - funny, this stamp was introduced by the Spaniards, they represent the social situation of the people, shows characters from various social strata. The Mojiganga can be seen in two moments in the patronal festivities, which takes place every year in July, (1) very early in the mornings run on the main streets of the city inviting the general public to the \\"paseo de res\\" (toretes) that will be delivered in the afternoon to one of the devotees (stewards) of the party And (2) in the afternoon when delivering the Paseo de res (toretes) and dance to the beat of cash or Roncador. The characters that are depicted are: the patron and the patrona who are the people who have money and in place, the shepherd and shepherdess representing mestizos or rural people and the Vilches who is the intermediate character, expresses power domain on the cattle. The dresses of the patron and patrona are very luxurious. The man wears suits, wearing a hat and cane, the lady wears dress, veil, wallet and shoes stick. The shepherds wear an elegant dress, suitable for the party. The lady wears an embroidered skirt, blouse, ojotas and straw hat, and the pastor's cloths are dress trousers, shirt, wool poncho, pannier, straw hat and carries a whip in his hand. The Vilches wears a dress embroidered with fine gold or silver thread, a crown of feathers with colored mirrors and, in the back enjalma carries a reminder that is painted or corduroy cloth embroidered with threads of gold leaf and presents varied reasons, also brings in a neck mo√±era (decorative ribbon) around the waist and a painted or embroidered pechera subsequently placed the res (toretes). All of them wear special masks. =The Blanquillos= Groups of warriors who were born in reaction against Spanish domination, like the \\"Huanca\\" and \\"shacshas.\\" The Blanquillo, toured many parts of Culture Conchucos, where the Spaniards were in place for killing them. These groups were warriors formed by townpeople Pasha, Spaniards and mestizos. They used to go early in the mornings fighting in main square of the city, that is why this dance shows the power struggle of those years. In those days, the \\"Pashas\\" spoke the \\"Cully\\" language and worshipped the god \\"Catequilla \\". We can see this stamp on July 24 and July 25 of each year. The Blanquillo dance through the main streets of the city to accompany the procession of Santiago Apostle. The group formed by 10 or 12 people, all wear elegant dresses made of corduroy fabric, yarn ornaments with gold leaf (Spanish-style), carry a face mask, a crown of feathers and colorful scarf colors . In his tour, the Blanquillo with a unique style, put his scarf in the shoulder of someone in the audience who can reward him with money, candy or soda. =The Kiyayas= Cully word that means \\"consecrated women\\". These group of ladies were designed to worship the \\"God Catequilla\\" and other gods (sun, moon, lightning and the rainbow). Always being around priests and the head of the high hierarchy of the Pashas. The Spaniards tried to exterminate this practice with its decrees and laws which were against cults, customs and languages. The KIYAYAS survived these abuses but as a stamp dance. s Like the \\"Blanquillo\\", the \\"kiyayas\\" are seen during the festivities in honor of the Santiago Apostle in July each year. Wearing a black skirt, with an opening from the side, decorated with threads of gold leaf and grecas of gold or silver, below the number fustanes wore white skirt decorated with special fabrics and reasons of culture Pasha, a white blouse with wide sleeves and bulky, In the head wearing a crown of showy flowers and tulle is covered with a bank, leather shoes are usually light. All of them wear silver jewelry. =Toro de Trapo= Dance manners paying tribute to the Virgin of Llactabamba. They accompany the \\"mamita\\" in the ascent to Cabana and return to his temple every year in November. The sire of this rag up on a wooden frames, lined with a white cloth and a black pa√±uelon in his spine is charged by a skilled volunteer who dances gleefully around of the Virgin statue.  Tourism  The District of Cabana counts on many archaeological vestiges, being the most excellent Strength of the Pashash, that could be the central bunker of defense and religious cult of the Conchucos Region; according to it affirms to the Lawyer Alexander Medina Alatrista: \\"Here it was the seat of √≠dolo Katequilla (Divinidad of the Conchucos and the Huamachucos)\\". In addition it also counts on the Ruins of Mashgonga.  Newspaper  Digital Journal BOLOGNESI NEWS with news and news of Cabana, Pallasca, Ancash.

It is one of the main types of humor in stand-up comedy. In an observational comedy act, the comedian \\"makes an observation about something from the backwaters of life, an everyday phenomenon that is rarely noticed or discussed.\\" The humor is based on the premise of \\"Have you ever noticed?\\" (or \\"Did you ever notice?\\"), which has become a comedy clich√©. \\"Observational humor usually takes the form of long monologs of personal narrative; the punchline is either hard to predict or never came.\\" Overview British comedians Richard Herring and Jo Caulfield wrote in an article that observational comedy \\"essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home.\\" Eddie Izzard noted that a comedian's observations \\"need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it\\" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act. Douglas Coupland writes, \\"Anybody can describe a pre-moistened towelette to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them.\\" He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a \\"lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units.\\" Observational comedy has been compared to sociology. History Although observational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s, one author suggests that it \\"has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature.\\" Comedians, however, have long been making observational comedy, though it may not have been called that before 1950. Will Rogers, who was similar to Mark Twain in that his comedic styles observed American plainsman and made fun of him, said, \\"I just watch the government, and report their activities.\\" Shelley Berman was one of the pioneers in the field. David Brenner's \\"brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups\\", like Jerry Seinfeld, who has been called \\"the master of observational comedy\\". Seinfeld's \\"brand of accessible, refined observational humor largely defined 1980s comedy.\\" A 1989 Los Angeles Times article wrote that Seinfeld is \\"clearly the standard of excellence in observational comedy\\", while Judd Apatow called Seinfeld \\"the greatest observational comedian who ever lived\\". George Carlin was a significant figure in observational comedy since the 1960s and influenced Seinfeld. The British observational comedy tradition began with the Irish comedian Dave Allen's performances in the early 1970s.

It's served unmixed in a tall glass. The modern drink originates from Sausalito, California in the early 1970s after an earlier one created in the 1930s in Phoenix, Arizona. The cocktail is named for its appearance when served‚Äîwith gradations of color resembling a sunrise. History The original tequila sunrise contained tequila, creme de cassis, lime juice, and soda water, and was served at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel where it was created by Gene Sulit in the 1930s or 1940s. The more popular modern version of the cocktail contains tequila, orange juice, and grenadine, and was created by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in the early 1970s while working as young bartenders at the Trident in Sausalito, California north of San Francisco. In 1972, at a private party at the Trident organized by Bill Graham to kick off the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour in America, Mick Jagger had one of the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking them. They later ordered them all across America, even dubbing the tour itself their \\"cocaine and tequila sunrise tour\\". At the time, the Trident was the largest outlet for tequila in the United States, and in 1973 Jose Cuervo picked up on the new drink as a marketing opportunity and put the recipe for the new drink on the back of their bottles of tequila, and promoted it in other ways. Later that same year, the Eagles recorded a song called \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" for their Desperado album as the drink was soaring in popularity. Preparation and serving The tequila sunrise is considered a long drink and is usually served in a collins or highball glass. The International Bartender Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail. The drink is mixed by pouring in Tequila, ice, then the juice and, lastly, syrup. The signature look of the drink depends on adding the syrup without mixing with the other ingredients. A spoon may be used to guide the syrup down the glass wall to the bottom of the glass with minimal mixing. =Variations= * Aperol sunrise ‚Äì substitute Aperol orange liqueur for grenadine * Tequila sunset ‚Äì substitute blackberry brandy, or dark rum, for grenadine * Caribbean sunrise ‚Äì use rum instead of tequila * Vodka (or Russian) sunrise ‚Äì use vodka instead of tequila * Southern sunrise ‚Äì use Southern Comfort instead of tequila * Astronaut sunrise ‚Äì use Tang instead of orange juice * Amaretto sunrise ‚Äì use Disaronno amaretto instead of tequila * Florida sunrise ‚Äì use equal measures of pineapple and orange juice * Red Sea sunrise ‚Äì non-alcoholic version that uses lemonade or Sprite instead of tequila * Enamorada sunrise ‚Äì substitute Campari for grenadine syrup * Colorado sunrise ‚Äì use Captain Morgan and Sunny Delight instead of tequila and orange juice * Goon sunrise ‚Äì use cask wine instead of tequila * Arizona Biltmore tequila sunrise ‚Äì Hornitos Plata tequila, creme de cassis, fresh lime juice, and club soda See also * List of cocktails Notes Category:Cocktails with tequila Category:Citrus cocktails Category:Three-ingredient cocktails Category:Sour cocktails Category:Sweet cocktails ","title":"Tequila sunrise (cocktail)"},{"id":"2733464","text":"Cleeve School is an academy school and Leadership Partner School aiming to provide \\"leadership with a moral purpose\\".

Set in the time of King Arthur, it is a family-oriented adventure show about an exiled prince who goes on a quest to become one of the Knights of the Round Table. He begins his quest after having a dream about Camelot and its idealistic New Order. This television series originally aired on The Family Channel for a total run of 65 episodes. Story summaryPremise= Like the original comic strip, the series begins with the fall of Thule, the fictional kingdom to which Prince Valiant is heir. Valiant, his parents, and a group of survivors from the castle are exiled by the ruthless conqueror Cynan to a hostile marsh across the sea. The young prince, deeply saddened by this defeat and vengeful towards Cynan, attempts to make the best of his new life but craves some greater purpose. He finds this purpose when he has a series of dreams about a kingdom called Camelot, King Arthur, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table. Valiant becomes enraptured with Camelot's New Order, which is founded on the ideas that might does not make right and that truth, justice, honor and friendship should be the guiding forces in people's dealings with each other. Against the wishes of his father, Valiant leaves the exiles' settlement in search of Camelot so that he may serve King Arthur as a Knight of the Round Table. During his quest, the prince meets two peasants who fall under the spell of his dream and join him. The first that he meets is Arn, a wandering peasant with great skills as a woodsman but who is ashamed of his class, illiteracy, and clumsiness. The second is Rowanne, the daughter of a blacksmith, who is feisty, unorthodox, and an expert with a bow and arrow. These three quickly become best friends and find Camelot together. But before they can become knights, they must undergo training, face off against various enemies, and do a bit more growing up. =Season one (26 episodes)= The first few episodes of the series deal with establishing Valiant's backstory and character, uniting him with Arn and Rowanne, and locating Camelot. Two main story arcs guide the rest of the season: 1) Valiant's training and emotional maturity; 2) Cynan's growing threat to Camelot. Through trial and error, Valiant learns the value of humility, patience, responsibility, and controlling his temper. This serves him well as he encounters various emissaries, both good and evil, connected to Cynan that indicate his ambition to invade Camelot. By the end of the season, Valiant has proven himself enough to be allowed to lead an army back to Thule and reclaim his homeland from Cynan's forces. He successfully does so with the help of Arn, Rowanne, Merlin, and his father King Williem. The season ends with Valiant bidding farewell to his parents and childhood home, returning to Camelot, and being knighted by King Arthur. There are also several stand-alone adventures that cause the trio of Valiant, Arn, and Rowanne to grow in fame throughout the kingdom. Several key storylines begin during the first season that would not be resolved until the following year. The most obvious is Arn and Rowanne's desire to be knighted ‚Äî their training and coming of age sagas continue throughout the second season. The love triangle amongst the trio (where Arn and Valiant both have feelings for Rowanne and Rowanne cares for both of them equally) is pushed to the background towards the end of the season and will resurface with new complications later on. Recurring villain Duncan Draconarius slowly undergoes a process of redemption that has yet to be completed. Another character, Denys, is briefly introduced yet will come into his own as a recurring character during the second season. Conflicts that are left to percolate until the second year include Camelot's hostilities with the Viking nation, the fallout from the massacre of the Viking peace delegation, the threat posed by a newly exiled Sir Mordred, and the beginnings of popular discontent towards Arthur's New Order. Also unknown are the final fates of the villains Robert (who is never heard from again), Cynan, Dylan, and Lord Maldon. =Season two (39 episodes)= Three main story arcs guide the overall course of the second season: 1) Valiant settling in as a knight and honing his leadership abilities; 2) Arn and Rowanne coming to terms with their insecurities as they continue to work towards knighthood; 3) the growing threat posed by the various factions of Mordred's New Dawn, a corruption of Arthur's New Order. Mordred and his partner Lord Maldon prey upon the public's prejudice against non-native Camelotians and fear of an imminent Viking invasion. The situation grows steadily worse over the course of the season as Mordred forms alliances with Camelot's enemies (including the Viking nation and the Misty Isles) and a traitor within Camelot takes steps to ensure its downfall. By this time, Arn and Rowanne have both earned their spots at the Round Table, while Valiant has risen in status to become one of the leading knights of Camelot. Towards the end of the series, King Arthur enacts a drastic plan to foil the New Dawn, a plan that goes awry due to Maldon and causes Arthur to be buried alive. Queen Guinevere then makes the surprise move of proclaiming Prince Valiant to be Arthur's chosen heir and the new King of Camelot. Camelot continues to lose ground against its enemies until a series of surprise events turn the tide of battle: the Vikings acquire information about Mordred that causes them to end their alliance; the general public revolts against the New Dawn's forces; Valiant defeats Mordred in combat and reclaims Excalibur; and Arthur returns alive and well. The series ends with King Arthur back on his throne and saluting the future of Camelot under the New Order as Valiant, Arn, and Rowanne stand by his side. Other notable storylines develop over the course of the season that influence the main plot arcs. One is the introduction of Princess Aleta and King Hugo of the Misty Isles ‚Äî these characters add new dimensions to the Valiant-Rowanne-Arn love triangle and the danger posed by Mordred's forces. The Northland storyline also complicates the love and war arcs while providing the catalyst for Arn and Rowanne to finally achieve knighthood. Duncan Draconarious is revisited in a few episodes that place him firmly on the side of Camelot. Several stories focus on Valiant's young squire Denys, including one that finalizes the fate of season one villains Cynan and Dylan. And of course, there are the stand- alone adventures that add to Valiant, Arn, and Rowanne's growing legend in Camelot. Some unresolved and underdeveloped plot threads are worth pointing out at this juncture. One is Valiant and Aleta's marriage, an important part of the comic strip that never transpired onscreen (the two characters end the series betrothed). Another is Rowanne's relationship with King Michael of Northland, which developed rather abruptly and lacked definite closure as the series geared up for its big finale. And the character of Lady Morgana, introduced in the first season with the potential to become a major antagonist, is forgotten about until the very end of the second season.

Themes *The New Order *Dawn/sunlight *Destiny *Maturity, coming of age *Friendship *Tolerance/prejudice *Trust/betrayal *Forgiveness/vengeance *Knighthood/The Round Table Connections to Arthurian lore and the comic strip The characters of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Merlin, Sir Gawain, Sir Mordred, Lady Morgana, and Sir Kay are all major characters with origins in Arthurian legend. Also pulled from traditional lore are Camelot, the Knights of the Round Table, and Arthur's sword Excalibur. The general chivalric principles Camelot is famous for have been codified on this series as the New Order. In addition, the second-season episode \\"The Black Rose\\" features the characters of King Lot, King Uther, and Queen Igraine in a flashback episode that retells the famous \\"sword in the stone\\" legend. Like the television series, the Prince Valiant comic strip is set in the world of King Arthur and features the above list of major characters amongst its cast. Both the comics and the TV show have the characters of Prince Valiant and Queen Aleta as well as their respective realms ‚Äî Thule and the Misty Isles ‚Äî and Valiant's Singing Sword. There are two Arns in the comic book continuity: a young prince who is Valiant's rival for a beautiful maiden, and Valiant and Aleta's firstborn son. The latter character grows up to become a heroic figure equal in importance to his father. In the comics, Valiant's father is named Aguar instead of Williem, while his mother in the comics is unnamed (she is called Briana on the series). In the comics Thule is conquered by a tyrant named Sligon (who has a daughter and no sons) rather than Cynan. There are several situations, adventures, and minor characters from the comics that are retold in the animated series. Rowanne and Sir Bryant are the two major characters from the television show that do not have counterparts in Arthurian legends or the long running Prince Valiant comic strip. Show merchandiseSoundtrack= The Legend of Prince Valiant Soundtrack consists of eighteen tracks of background themes produced, composed and performed by the instrumental duo Exchange (Gerald O‚ÄôBrien and Steve Sexton). The soundtrack is noteworthy for including the full version of the show's opening theme (Where the Truth Lies) as well as a pop song using the show's love music (Love Called Out My Name).

The NES version is a fighter/action game and tells the story of Valiant's search for Camelot at the beginning of season one. The player controls Valiant, enabling him to walk, jump, and throw things at opponents. Typical obstacles are pit traps, water hazards and Archers embedded in the background who shoot like turrets from a stationary position. The Game Boy version is a strategy game where all fighting is done in an arcade manner rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game. Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent. Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over. =DVD releases= BCI Eclipse LLC (under its Ink & Paint classic animation entertainment brand) (under license from Hearst Entertainment and SGC Entertainment) released the complete series on DVD for the very first time, in 2006/2007, in 2 volume sets.Prince Valiant DVD news: A Valiant press release .

It has three distinctions: it is the first of her novels to deal with the Regency period; it is one of only a few to combine both genres for which she was noted, the Regency romance and the mystery novel; and it is the only one of her Regency stories to feature Beau Brummell as an actual character, rather than as someone merely mentioned in passing. The story is set in 1811‚Äì1812.See http://www.georgette- heyer.com/chron.html Plot summary Judith Taverner is a beautiful young heiress who comes to London to join high society. She takes an instant dislike to her unwilling guardian, Julian, fifth Earl of Worth, who, having met her earlier in a small town filled with bucks watching a boxing match, treats her with a familiarity reserved for loose women. Judith soon becomes a sensation in London. She gets many offers of marriage (including one from the Duke of Clarence). Worth does not permit her to marry any one of them. This initially makes Judith very angry, but she comes to appreciate it later. Judith has a younger brother named Peregrine (Perry) who is a young handsome boy with very little sense and a lot of money to spare. Hence, he is always getting into trouble. Perry and Judith's cousin Bernard Taverner seems always so kind and attentive, though there is little love lost between him and Worth. The Black Swan Inn, which stood beside the tollgate at Pease Pottage appears in Chapter XVI Perry keeps getting into scrapes. He is challenged to a duel, gets held up, and nearly gets poisoned. Worth suspects that Bernard is the villain and he sends his brother, Captain the Hon. Charles Audley to watch over Perry. Meanwhile, Bernard tries to convince Judith that it is Worth who is the real culprit. In the end, after Worth provokes Taverner into acting, the truth comes out and Bernard is shown to be the guilty one. The sparring and eventual love affair of Judith and Julian, against the backdrop of Judith's brother Peregrine's romance and danger, make up this novel.

In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past. The word \\"cerclage\\" means \\"hoop\\" in French, as in the metal hoop encircling a barrel.Fabrication d'un tonneau :fr:Fabrication d'un tonneau#Cerclage There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity. The success rate for cervical cerclage is approximately 80-90% for elective cerclages, and 40-60% for emergency cerclages. A cerclage is considered successful if labor and delivery is delayed to at least 37 weeks (full term). After the cerclage has been placed, the patient will be observed for at least several hours (sometimes overnight) to ensure that she does not go into premature labor. The patient will then be allowed to return home, but will be instructed to remain in bed or avoid physical activity (including sexual intercourse) for two to three days, or up to two weeks. Follow-up appointments will usually take place so that her doctor can monitor the cervix and stitch and watch for signs of premature labor. For women who are pregnant with one baby (a singleton pregnancy) and at risk for a preterm birth, when cerclage is compared with no treatment, there is a reduction in preterm birth and there may be a reduction in the number of babies who die (perinatal mortality) There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity. Various studies have been undertaken to investigate whether cervical cerclage is more effective when combined with other treatments, such as antibiotics or vaginal pessary, but the evidence remains uncertain. Types There are three types of cerclage: *A McDonald cerclage, described in 1957, is the most common, and is essentially a pursestring stitch used to cinch the cervix shut; the cervix stitching involves a band of suture at the upper part of the cervix while the lower part has already started to efface. This cerclage is usually placed between 16 weeks and 18 weeks of pregnancy. The stitch is generally removed around the 37th week of gestation or earlier if needed. This procedure was developed by the Australian Gynecologist and Obstetrician, I.A. McDonald. *A Shirodkar cerclage is very similar, but the sutures pass through the walls of the cervix so they're not exposed. This type of cerclage is less common and technically more difficult than a McDonald, and is thought (though not proven) to reduce the risk of infection. The Shirodkar procedure sometimes involves a permanent stitch around the cervix which will not be removed and therefore a Caesarean section will be necessary to deliver the baby. The Shirodkar technique was first described by V. N. Shirodkar in Bombay in 1955. In 1963, Shirodkar traveled to NYC to perform the procedure at the New York Hospital of Special Surgery; the procedure was successful, and the baby lived to adulthood. *An abdominal cerclage, the least common type, is permanent and involves placing a band at the very top and outside of the cervix, inside the abdomen. This is usually only done if the cervix is too short to attempt a standard cerclage, or if a vaginal cerclage has failed or is not possible. However, a few doctors (namely Arthur Haney at the University of Chicago and George Davis at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) are pushing for the transabdominal cerclage (TAC) to replace vaginal cerclages, due to perceived better outcomes and more pregnancies carried to term. A c-section is required for women giving birth with a TAC. A transabdominal cerclage can also be placed pre-pregnancy if a patient has been diagnosed with an incompetent cervix. Risks While cerclage is generally a safe procedure, there are a number of potential complications that may arise during or after surgery. These include: * risks associated with regional or general anesthesia * premature labor * premature rupture of membranes * infection of the cervix * infection of the amniotic sac (chorioamnionitis) * cervical rupture (may occur if the stitch is not removed before onset of labor) * uterine rupture (may occur if the stitch is not removed before onset of labor)Nashar, S., Dimitrov, A., Slavov, S., & Nikolov, A. (2009). Akusherstvo i ginekologiia, 48(3), 44‚Äì46. * injury to the cervix or bladder * bleeding * Cervical Dystocia with failure to dilate requiring Cesarean Section * displacement of the cervix  Alternatives  The Arabin Pessary is a silicone device that has been suggested to prevent spontaneous preterm birth without the need for surgery. The leading hypotheses for its mechanisms were that it could help keep the cervix closed similarly to the cerclage, as well as change the inclination of the cervical canal so that the pregnancy weight is not directly above the internal os. However, large randomized clinical trials in singleton and twin pregnancies found that the cervical pessary did not result in a lower rate of spontaneous early preterm birth. Therefore, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendation is that placement of cervical pessary in pregnancy to decrease preterm birth, should be used only in the context of a clinical trial or research protocol.

This includes both physical and mental activities, covering a wide range of intensities and levels of social acceptability. The term originated in the BDSM club and party communities, indicating the activities taking place within a scene. It has since extended to the full range of BDSM activities. Play can take many forms. It ranges from light \\"getting to know you\\" sessions where participants discover each other's likes and dislikes to extreme, extended play between committed individuals that know each other's limits and are willing to push or be pushed at their boundaries. While physical activities are better known and more infamous, it also includes 'mental play' such as erotic hypnosis and mind games. BDSM play is usually the primary topic of negotiation, especially for casual players and limited scenes. Most BDSM clubs and local communities offer classes and materials about negotiating play scenes. Play safety is a major topic of discussion and debate within BDSM communities. Categories of play Play is broken down into two broad categories, physical and mental. Physical play is better known and consists of the typical activities the average person thinks of as BDSM. As the BDSM scene matures and gains greater mainstream tolerance, mental play is becoming an increasingly noteworthy part of the community. =Physical BDSM= Physical BDSM encompasses all \\"kinky\\" activities that are carried out physically. Two of the best known examples are flogging and bondage. Extensive classes and workshops teach technical skills to carry out these activities competently, as well as safety considerations and protocols. This is the type of play most often seen in BDSM clubs and in media representations of kink. While often associated with sadism and masochism, many activities are not focused on or even involve pain. Non-painful sensation play and elaborate bondage done mainly for aesthetic purposes are prominent examples. =Mental BDSM= Mental BDSM is the collection of activities intended to create a psychological impact, often without a physical component. Recreational hypnosis is the most prominent example, with a well-developed international community. Another noteworthy but controversial example is the 'mind fuck', wherein a state confusion and/or psychological conflict is intentionally created. While mental 'players' have considerably less documented material to study, an active Internet community and classes offered through local groups and conventions provide many learning opportunities. Types of play Participants in BDSM typically recognizes different types of play, based on their intensity and social acceptability. These distinctions can be rather arbitrary and variant. What is considered edge play for a particular couple or local community may be merely heavy play, or even light play, for others. =Light play= Light play consists of activities that are considered mild and/or carry little social stigma. This especially includes BDSM elements commonly practiced by \\"vanilla\\" couples. Light bondage, slapping, and casual spanking are examples of light play. =Heavy play= Heavy play indicates elements that are intense and/or carry substantial social stigma. The bulk of activities undertaken by BDSM participants would be considered heavy play or as bordering on heavy play. Examples of heavy play includes caning, suspension bondage, and erotic hypnosis. =Edge play= Edgeplay is a term used for types of play that \\"push the edge.\\" They usually involve a risk of physical or emotional harm. Breath play, knife play, gun play and blood play are all types of edge play. In males, restriction of flow of urine and semen may contribute to the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction. Edge play can also literally refer to playing with an edge, for example knives, swords and other implements. It is sometimes used to describe activities that challenge the boundaries of the participants. This type of play generally falls under the umbrella of RACK (Risk Aware Consensual Kink). Safety and consent Safety and consent in play are paramount considerations within the BDSM community. Various models of consent and negotiation are employed. Most participants consider it important to take responsibility for the safety of their partners. In addition, consent is typically what they consider to distinguish BDSM activities from abuse (or more specifically, intimate partner violence).

It is common to find crude oil containing some impurities. When the total sulfur level in the oil is more than 0.5% the oil is called \\"sour\\". The impurities need to be removed before this lower-quality crude can be refined into petrol, thereby increasing the cost of processing. This results in a higher-priced gasoline than that made from sweet crude oil. Current environmental regulations in the United States strictly limit the sulfur content in refined fuels such as diesel and gasoline. The majority of the sulfur in crude oil occurs bonded to carbon atoms, with a small amount occurring as elemental sulfur in solution and as hydrogen sulfide gas. Sour oil can be toxic and corrosive, especially when the oil contains higher levels of hydrogen sulfide, which is a breathing hazard. At low concentrations the gas gives the oil the smell of rotting eggs. For safety reasons, sour crude oil needs to be stabilized by having hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) removed from it before being transported by oil tankers. Since sour crude is more common than sweet crude in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico, Platts has come out in March 2009 with a new sour crude benchmark (oil marker) called \\"Americas Crude Marker (ACM)\\".Americas Crude Marker (ACM) Dubai Crude and Oman Crude, both sour crude oils, have been used as a benchmark (crude oil) oil marker for Middle East crude oils for some time.

It is native to Australia, and is a vagrant to New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Taxonomy The renowned ornithologist John Gould first described the yellow- billed spoonbill, naming it Platalea flavipes although noting its distinctness from other members of the genus. Bonaparte erected the genus Platibis in 1856, and Gould followed this classification in his later work. He noted the species appeared in great numbers across New South Wales in 1839, particularly in the north between the Hunter and lower Namoi Rivers. The year had been wet, in contrast to droughts in previous years. A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills by Chesser and colleagues found that the yellow-billed and roseate spoonbills were each other's closest relative, and the two were descended from an early offshoot from the ancestors of the other four spoonbill species. They felt the genetic evidence meant it was equally valid to consider all six to be classified within the genus Platalea or alternatively the two placed in the monotypic genera Platibis and Ajaia respectively. However, as the six species were so similar morphologically, keeping them within the one genus made more sense. Description Measuring around , the yellow-billed spoonbill has all white plumage. The long spoon- shaped bill, bare-skinned face, legs and feet are all yellow, while the iris is pale yellow. The sexes are similar in plumage and coloration. In the breeding season, the face is lined with black, long hackles develop on the chest, and the wings have black tips. The bill of the yellow-billed spoonbill is narrower and works more like a forceps than the larger-ended and more spoon-like bill of the royal spoonbill, which acts like a pair of tongs. Like all members of the ibis and spoonbill family, it always flies with its head extended. Distribution and habitat The yellow-billed spoonbill is found across eastern, northern and southwestern Australia, particularly around water, and has been recorded as a vagrant to New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. It is not found in Tasmania. It nests in trees, marshes or reed-beds, and often roosts in trees. It occurs in shallows of wetlands, and occasionally on dry pasture. Feeding Yellow-billed spoonbill feeding at Lake Monger by sweeping its bill through the water The yellow-billed spoonbill is carnivorous, catching small animals by sweeping its bill through shallow water and swallowing prey once it is detected. When slow sweeping, the spoonbill walks with the bill at an angle at about 60 degrees to horizontal and with the bill tip open about , sweeping an arc of around 120 degrees in front of the bird. The bird walks slowly, kicking up debris and small animals from the bottom of the water, which it then senses and catches with its bill. When an item is detected, the spoonbill switches to intensive sweeping of a small area. The yellow-billed spoonbill has a row of small blunt knobs known as papillae which line the margins of the upper and lower mandible of the \\"spoon\\". These are sensory structures which help the bird sense vibration and hence seize its prey. One field study at Lake Cowal in New South Wales found the water depth selected for feeding to be less than . As well as lakes and swamps, the birds feed in paddocks inundated after heavy rain. Foraging occurs both during the day and at night. Yellow-billed spoonbills also probe submerged plants directly for prey, and seize prey such as spiders above ground. They have been observed dragging their bills alongside themselves through shallow water while walking. Prey items recorded at Lake Cowal include freshwater crustaceans such as the common yabby (Cherax destructor); shrimp of the genus Macrobrachium and family Atyidae; insects, particularly aquatic bugs of the families Notonectidae and Corixidae; fish such as mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and flathead gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps); and occasionally freshwater snails and plant material such as medic burr (Medicago polymorpha). Breeding Atkinson's Dam, SE Queensland, Australia The yellow- billed spoonbill nests once or twice a year, generally when water is plentiful. The breeding season varies: it is usually March to May after the wet season in the north of the country, and in winter‚Äìspring (August to October) in more temperate areas. The nest is a platform constructed of sticks; it has a hollowed centre, and can be located on the branches or fork of a tree, the base of which is often submerged in water. Reed beds are another nest location. The clutch consists of two to four dull white eggs measuring 68 x 45 mm. Nests are often located in colonies, with other species such as the royal spoonbill, Australian white ibis, straw-necked ibis, as well as herons, egrets or cormorants.

He was a student of Norbert Wiener at MIT (PhD 1930).

Koforidua was founded in 1875 by migrants from Ashanti. It is also called New Juaben. The city has a settlement city proper population of 183,727 people as of 2010, Koforidua is an amalgamation of two Municipalities ; New Juaben North and South. The city has a blend of colonial and modern architecture. Koforidua serves as a commercial centre for the Eastern region and New-Juaben Municipal District. The city is home to many businesses, with the exception of heavy duty industries. The city is home to Intravenous Infusions Ltd., one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in Ghana and West Africa, a leading producer of injections and drips .The company is listed on the Ghana Stock exchange and was registered in 1969 . The city is home to many Government Departments and Ministries at the Regional level. The recent construction of the four-lane highway road linking the Koforidua Technical University and Koforidua to Oyoko brings commerce to the city. The highway also serves as a valid alternative route to reach Kumasi. Etymology Oral tradition has it that, Koforidua owes its name to an Akan man, Kofi Ofori, who had built his hut under a huge mahogany tree. This tree provided shelter for weary farmers who were returning from their farms after a hard day's work. Over time, it became common for the farmers to say that they were going to rest under Kofi Ofori's tree. In Akan language, Twi, the word for tree is \\"dua\\". An amalgamation of Kofi Ofori's name and tree, therefore, becomes \\"Koforidua.\\" Koforidua today is a multi-ethnic city with people from various ethnic groups in Ghana calling the city their home. History Koforidua was founded in 1875 by Akan migrants from Asanteman. The completion of the Kumasi railway in 1923 saw Koforidua become an important road and rail junction. Koforidua is one of the country's oldest cocoa-producing centres. It is also noted today for its weekly Thursday bead market, which draws bead buyers and sellers from all over the Eastern region. =Legend about Koforidua= Legend has it that, the Obuotabiri mountain found in New Juabeng, was the home of the gods and protected the people. It was believed to be inhabited by dwarfs and thus was considered the soul of the New Juabeng traditional area. All the townsfolk have great reverence for the mountain: OBUOTABIRI - the rock of Tabiri. Geography and climate Umbrella Rock tourism site The New Juaben Municipality falls within the Eastern Region of South Ghana. The municipality covers an estimated area of 110 square kilometres, constituting 0.57% of the total land area of the Eastern Region. The municipality has 48 electoral areas. Koforidua has an annual rainfall ranging from 50 ‚Äì 120 inches and 20 ‚Äì 32 Celsius mean annual temperatures. The New-Juaben municipality shares boundaries with East-Akim Municipality to the northeast, Akwapim North District to the east and south, and Suhum-Kraboa- Coaltar District to the west. The city of Koforidua (New Juabeng) is made up of several neighbourhoods and settlements, including Effiduase, Asokore, Oyoko, Jumapo, Suhyen, Dansuagya, Betom, and Srodae. Koforidua is two hours by road from Accra. Demographics Main Street in Koforidua Presently the city's population is 127,334 people and is dominated by Akans. The 'Akwantukese' (The Big Journey Festival) is celebrated yearly to mark the movement of the inhabitants of Koforidua's ancestors from 'Asanteman' to their present location of Koforidua. Economy High Street in Koforidua =Industries= The city is home to one of Ghana's oldest pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies i.e. Intravenous infusion Ltd which manufactures drips and injections for the West African Market . Other Industrial activities of Koforidua include textiles, crafts, soap, carpentry and joinery, traditional medicine, pottery and ceramics, and the production of alcoholic and non- alcoholic beverages.Latest Ghana News. Vibe Ghana = Financial Services = Koforidua is also home to many financial services companies ranging from Universal Banks, Micro-finance, Rural Banks and Savings and Loans Companies to Insurance Companies. =Agriculture= The city currently depends mainly on Government Administration, Retailing, hospitality, commercial and Education services . With inhabitants in the Cornubations(Outskirt surrounding communities) engaging in some form of subsistence farming. =Cocoa production= Koforidua produces cocoa. However, as cocoa production has moved westward to the Ashanti Region and Brong-Ahafo Region areas of virgin soil, Koforidua has become increasingly dependent upon its commercial and business administrative functions. The city of Koforidua has only small-medium scale industries today. Tourism Theora Video of the Waterfall and Tourist attraction (Boti falls) in the Suburbs of Koforidua in the Eastern region of Ghana. Koforidua's predominant tourism attractions include such natural features as Obuo Tabri Mountain, which is considered sacred. Nearby is Akosombo Dam, which holds Lake Volta, the world's largest man-made lake. Waterfalls in the area, such as Akaa Falls and Boti Falls, and the Umbrella Rock attract tourists to the Eastern region. Even though such tourist sites are functioning all year round, tourists are at times encouraged to visit the place at certain times of the year, especially during the rainy seasons. At such times, the Boti Falls in particular is fully at its peak beauty and very interesting to visit. Education Pentecost Senior High School in Koforidua Koforidua remains a major hub of education in Ghana. It is home to many basic schools and a number of prominent senior high schools in the country. In 2012, one of its schools; Pope John Senior High School and Minor Seminary, was ranked 9th of the over 200 senior high schools in Ghana. The city also has a Technical University (Koforidua Technical University)https://www.ktu.edu.gh and two private universities (All Nations University College) and (Ghana telecom University College). and has campuses for other national Universities, the city also has a Teacher training college, Nursing and Midwifery College and other educational institutions. There are other High Schools in Koforidua. These include; Koforidua Secondary Technical Senior High School (K.S.T.S), Pope John Senior High and Junior Seminary (Pojoss), Oti Boateng Senior High School (Oboss), Pentecost Senior High School(Pensec), Ghana Senior High School (Ghanass, Koforidua), New Juabeng Senior High School (Njuasco), SDA Senior High School (Sedass), Oyoko Methodist Senior High School (Omess), amongst some other technical (Koforidua Technical Institute) and Private Vocational Schools.

It was the first summit level canal to be built in Ireland or Great Britain, and pre-dated the more famous Bridgewater Canal by nearly thirty years and Sankey Canal by fifteen years. It was authorised by the Commissioners of Inland Navigation for Ireland, and was publicly funded. It was opened in 1742, but there were issues with the lock construction, the width of the summit level and the water supply. Below Newry, a ship canal was opened in 1769, and both Newry and the canal flourished. By 1800, the canal was in a poor condition, and another ¬£57,000 of public money was spent refurbishing it over the following ten years. Closures during the refurbishment resulted in a loss of traffic, which did not fully recover. In 1829, both canals were transferred to a private company, who spent ¬£80,000 on improvements over the next twenty years. The ship canal was enlarged in 1884, to allow ships of 5,000 tons to reach Newry. It reverted to public ownership in 1901, when the Newry Port and Harbour Authority was created. The canal closed in 1936 and most of it was officially abandoned in 1949, with some in 1956. The ship canal closed in 1966 and the Authority was wound up in 1974. Two sections of the redundant canal were bought by local authorities, for two pounds each, and the middle section was given to another two local authorities. The ship canal has been reopened for use by pleasure craft, and there have been attempts to reopen the Newry Canal, which have not yet been successful. The towpath has become part of a long distance footpath and also part of the National Cycle Network. Some restoration has taken place, and the canal has become a haven for wildlife. Parts of it are also used for coarse fishing. History Whether or not the usefulness of a navigable route from the inland lake of Lough Neagh to Carlingford Lough, on the coast to the south of Lough Neagh was considered before the 1640s is unknown, but during Oliver Cromwell's campaign in Ireland at that time, a survey of the area was made, and Colonel Monk ordered that a navigable trench from Portadown to Newry should be cut. Despite the order, no work was carried out, nor was it when Francis Nevil, a tax collector for the government, made a similar survey and proposal in 1703. Shortly afterwards, the Tyrone coalfield was discovered, and there was pressure to provide a route for the coal to reach Dublin. A bill was put before parliament in 1715, for works to improve drainage and the carriage of goods, but failed to become an Act of Parliament, and there was a gradual realisation that a local area such as this could provide neither the capital nor the expertise for such undertakings. In order to address the situation, the Irish Parliament in 1717 offered a reward of ¬£1,000 to the first person to produce 500 tons of native coal in Dublin and the Commissioners of Inland Navigation for Ireland were set up in 1729, consisting of three high officials from the government, four bishops, and eighty responsible persons, who would oversee all matters concerned with inland waterways. With the hope that a good transport route from the Tyrone coalfields to Dublin could result in the city becoming self-sufficient in coal, rather than having to rely on imports from Great Britain, which were often intermittent, the canal was approved by the Commissioners. Work did not begin immediately, as Thomas Burgh was Surveyor General, and he had interests in the collieries at Ballycastle, which would be affected by Tyrone coal becoming more generally available. Burgh died in 1730, to be succeeded by Edward Lovett Pearce, and work began on the canal in 1731. Although Pearce was officially running the scheme, he was busy constructing the new Parliament House at the time, and gave the task to one of his architectural assistants, Richard Cassels. Cassels had escaped from the religious persecution of the Hugenots in France, and had travelled in Germany, the Low Countries and England, where he had studied navigation works, before arriving in Ireland to work for Pearce. At the time he was known as Richard Castle, but reverted to his original name as his stature as an architect grew. With the death of Pearce in 1733, Cassels became the engineer for the project, which included building the first navigation lock in Ireland. He was discharged in 1736, probably because he was paying more attention to the architectural commissions he had taken over from Pearce. He was replaced by Thomas Steers, who employed a local man called William Gilbert to oversee the work, which was completed by 1741. Legal disputes delayed the official opening until 1742, and a barge loaded with coal from the Tyrone coalfields reached Dublin on 28 March 1742, although the first part or the journey had involved carriage of the coal overland to Lough Neagh, as the Tyrone Navigation, begun in 1732, was far from complete. The Newry Canal has 14 locks, nine of them to the south of the summit, which is above the level of Carlingford Lough. The locks are long and wide. They were deep and each lock was faced with stone from the Benburb quarries early in the 1800s after the original brick sides began to crumble. Despite the manager, Acheson Johnston, having to report to Parliament in 1750 that there were defective locks, water shortage problems and issues with the width of the summit section, the merchants of Newry were keen to develop the town as a port, and obtained a government grant to build a ship canal to the town. The first contractor, John Golbourne from Chester, was dismissed, and Thomas Omer took over as engineer. The Commissioners of Inland Navigation had invited him to Ireland in 1755, and there is some evidence that he worked on river navigations in England after arriving there from the Holland, but his work was not of a high standard, and created problems for those following him. Omer ignored the previously planned route, and created a ship canal which could accommodate boats of up to 120 tonnes. Newry flourished as a port after its completion in 1769, as did trade on the Newry Canal, although it was largely grain and general merchandise, rather than the coal for which it had been designed. The canal also assisted the development of the Tyrone linen industry and the production of butter for export. =Operation= Despite its shortcomings, the canal was earning around ¬£7,000 per year from tolls by the 1790s. However, the canal was being run by local people who had taken over the canal after the Commissioners were dismissed, and they failed to invest in its improvement or maintenance. By 1800 it was in a ruinous state, and the Director General took control. Henry Walker, an engineer, was asked to put it back into good order, but was imprisoned and then deported to America for acting fraudulently. John Brownrigg then produced a detailed report of its condition, in which he suggested it would be cheaper to build a new canal than repair the existing one, but his advice was ignored. As the refurbishment involved the rebuilding of many bridges and locks, widening and deepening the summit level, there were long periods where the canal was effectively closed. The water supply was improved, and the ship lock was restored, but inevitably, closures resulted in traffic transferring to road transport, and it proved difficult to attract it back to the canal, once the work was completed in 1811. Between 1818 and 1827, the canal collected tolls of ¬£2,546 per year, and its reserves rose from ¬£8,520 in 1800 to ¬£28,000 in 1829. If the ¬£57,000 of public money spent on its restoration was ignored, it made a modest profit. William Dawson introduced a private passenger service from Portadown to Newry in 1813, and although he was always asking for the tolls to be reduced, the service continued for many years. Although the Tyrone Navigation had finally opened in 1787, this did not result in coal traffic using the canal. The importance of Newry as a port declined as Belfast became more prominent, and the ship canal could not cope with the increasing size of ships as sail was replaced by steam. Various engineers were consulted, including John Brownrigg, Sir John Rennie and Alexander Nimmo. All suggested that a larger sea lock was required in deeper water, and that the ship canal needed to be enlarged. In 1829, the government agreed to transfer both the ship canal and the Newry Canal to a private company, whose chairman was the Marquess of Downshire. The Directors General objected, as they had not been consulted, and felt that it was wrong to transfer an undertaking that had been built using public money to a private company. However, the company agreed to spend ¬£80,000 on improvements over the following twenty years, and kept their word. By 1850, a new sea lock had been built, some further down the estuary, which doubled the size of ships that could use it. The river had been dredged, and the Albert Basin had been constructed at Newry. The Newry Canal also benefitted, with receipts rising to ¬£3,500 per year, resulting from the tonnage carried doubling to over 100,000 tons per year. =Decline= Scarva canal bridge. With the coming of the railways in the 1850s, the canal went into decline. The railway line from Belfast to Dublin opened in 1852, and ran parallel to the canal for much of its length. Newry was integrated into the system by the construction of a short branch line, and in 1865 a link from Newry to the Ulster Railway at Armagh was completed. Newry prospered as a port, with traffic passing through it more than trebling from 103,560 tons in 1831 to 363,558 tons in 1888, but in the same period, traffic on the canal halved from 70,749 tons to 33,500 tons. The owning company was still saddled with debts from the engineering projects carried out since 1829, and coal traffic from the Tyrone collieries had all but ceased. Despite this, there was still some traffic on the canal, most of it passing northwards from Newry, including imported coal, timber and heavy goods, where the canal remained competitive with the railways. In 1884, the company carried out its last major engineering project, when the upper reaches of Carlingford Lough and the lower Newry River were made deeper, and the navigable channel widened to . This allowed ships of up to 5,000 tons to reach Newry. The project cost ¬£55,000, and was authorised by the Newry Navigation Act. There were plans to extend the Clogher Valley Railway to Newry in 1900, but those proposing the scheme realised that the Newry Navigation Company would object to the scheme, and relationships between the Canal company and Newry Urban Council were already strained. The railway scheme was thus dropped, after which the promoters and council jointly approached the Canal company, with a plan to buy out the company and create a public corporation, in which the interests of the town and port would be adequately represented. The Newry Port and Harbour Trust was established in 1901, and the Newry Canal made a small profit until the First World War. Afterwards, maintenance costs swamped any income received, and the last recorded commercial traffic was in 1936. The Northern Ireland administration had no interest in canals, and a warrant of abandonment was issued on 7 May 1949, which covered all but the Newry town section, which was similarly abandoned on 21 March 1956. Soon the swing bridges in Newry were replaced by fixed bridges, cutting off the canal from the sea, and the ship canal was closed in 1966 when Warrenpoint replaced the port of Newry. The Newry Port and Harbour Trust was wound up in 1974. =Restoration= Enterprise crossing the Newry Canal. Liquidators handling the disposal of the Trust's assets approached the local councils, and Newry and Mourne District Council bought the ship canal and the section of the Newry Canal which was within its jurisdiction for two pounds. Craigavon Borough Council bought the northern section for another two pounds in the early 1980s, and the middle section was given to Armagh City and District Council and Banbridge District Council in 1992. The Newry Canal was one of the first of the waterways of Northern Ireland to be considered for restoration. A plan was costed in 1980, and an attempt to secure Millennium Lottery funding was made in 1996, but failed due to the lack of matched funding. The proposals involved using the existing course for most of the route, but bypassing the fixed bridges of Newry by using the Clanrye River, which would involve building one or two new locks. Moneypenny's Lock (No. 14), which was named after the lock- keepers who lived there for over 80 years, has been restored by Craigavon Borough Council. Banbridge District Council maintain a small museum at Scarva, and the ship canal and sea lock have been restored by Newry and Mourne District Council. It now provides access for leisure craft visiting Newry. It is suitable for boats up to by with a draught of up to . Victoria Lock, where the ship canal joins the sea, is tidal, and was automated in May 2007. Since closure, some sections have fallen into a state of disrepair. Although most of the lock gates have long since rotted away, many of the locks themselves are in excellent condition, being constructed from local Mourne granite. It is now overgrown for much of its length; however, this means that it is now a haven for wildlife. This includes larger mammals like otters, and the Brackagh Bog area provides habitat for several species which are not found elsewhere in Northern Ireland, including plants, damselflies, dragonflies and 19 species of butterflies. There is a flow of fresh water along the canal, and good stocks of fish. Coarse fishing for perch, roach, bream and pike is possible on the River Bann, on the ship canal, and on parts of the canal, although the lower sections are choked with weed. The towpath has been reopened, and is now part of the Ulster Way long distance footpath. It has been incorporated into the National Cycle Network, and is maintained by two wardens throughout the year. Railway access The Belfast‚ÄìNewry railway line provides access for walkers to the canal at the Northern Ireland Railways stations of Portadown, Scarva and Poyntzpass.

Created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Joe Staton, he first appeared in Millennium #2 (January 1988). Extra√±o is noted for being the first openly gay superhero in DC Comics. The character never said the word \\"gay\\" in the comic, but it was commonly understood that he was. One writer states: \\"Extra√±o embodied nearly every stereotype of a gay man. He was flamboyant and colorful, and he referred to himself in the third person, as 'Auntie'. Extra√±o was mainly used as comic relief, and he never had a boyfriend\\". The character was controversial, both internally at DC Comics as well as with the readership. Englehart wanted to explore the character more, including a storyline about HIV, but Englehart later said that the editor, Andy Helfer, didn't want gay characters in his comics, and \\"he thought that Extra√±o was 'cured' at the end of Millennium.\\" Extra√±o was ultimately killed by HIV infection, but it was contracted from a fight with an \\"AIDS vampire\\" supervillain called the Hemo-Goblin.

As a minor magician, his magical powers were heightened by the procedure, and his fellow participants gained new abilities as well. Together, they formed the superhero team New Guardians, and took it upon themselves to fight evil wherever it lurked on Earth. Extra√±o initially wears loose colorful garments and refers to himself as \\"Auntie\\", often imparting parental advice to his teammates. Serving as the team's resident magician, he could fire blasts of energy from his hands, levitate, and perform a large number of \\"stage tricks, including ping- pong 'balls'\\" to outwit his foes. He had an earnest sense of justice and love of life that made him popular with his teammates. During The New Guardians' short run, Extra√±o acquired a powerful crystal skull (which seemed to greatly amplify his abilities) and a more traditional, \\"masculine\\" superhero costume, perhaps as a reaction to the comments of readers. In The New Guardians, Extra√±o helped his team defeat a number of supervillains while trying his best to assist teammates with their personal problems. On one mission in particular, he was attacked by an \\"AIDS vampire\\" called the Hemo-Goblin. He was subsequently confirmed to be HIV-positive but it is unclear whether he was infected by Hemo-Goblin or had already been infected prior to his introduction. Though he showed no outward signs of the disease, his infection remained a somewhat unorthodox plot point. Although the Guardians continued to fight evildoers behind the scenes even after their comic ended, their island base was attacked and swallowed up by the villain Entropy in the pages of Green Lantern. For a time it was assumed Extra√±o died during this incident, but the subsequent reappearance of other New Guardians throws this into doubt.

After the timeline-altering events of the 2016 DC Rebirth relaunch, Henry Bendix tries to recruit Extra√±o against Midnighter and Apollo, but Gregorio De La Vega now shuns his previous persona, and refuses.Steve Orlando (w), Blanco, Fernando (a).

Midnighter subsequently journeys to Gregorio's Lima, Peru home, The Sacrarium, that Gregorio shares with a man named Hugh (probably the therianthrope known as the Tasmanian Devil) and an adopted girl with wings named Suri. Gregorio agrees to help Midnighter, and locates Apollo's soul in Hell, where it was relegated after Apollo's encounter with Mawzir.Steve Orlando (w), Blanco, Fernando (a). Midnighter and Apollo #2 (January 2017). DC Comics. Writer Steve Orlando, who is bisexual, explains his decision to reintroduce the character, saying: \\"With a book like Midnighter & Apollo, which from cover to cover is a love letter to queer characters and our struggle to live, be visible and love, it felt right to return to one of the first and reintroduce Gregorio to a new generation\\".Gustines, George Gene (March 26, 2017). \\"Adventures in Comics and the Real World\\". The New York Times. Powers and abilities Being a magician, Extra√±o has a number of abilities linked to his trade. Unlike stage parlor tricks, these spells rely on real sorcery and can be used for a variety of effects.

Early life  Portrait of Spencer and his father, by alt= Spencer was born on 19 December 1734 at Althorp, his family home in Northamptonshire. He was the only son of Hon. John Spencer and his wife, the former Georgiana Caroline Carteret (1716‚Äì1780). His only sibling was sister Diana Spencer, who died at eight years old. After his father's alcohol-related death in 1746, his mother married secondly William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper. His father was the youngest son of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, the First Lord of the Treasury and Lord President of the Council under George I, and his second wife, Lady Anne Churchill (third daughter of the 1st Duke of Marlborough), who served as Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne. Among his paternal family were uncle Robert Spencer, 4th Earl of Sunderland; aunt Lady Anne Spencer (wife of 1st Viscount Bateman); Charles Spencer, 5th Earl of Sunderland (who succeeded his great-aunt, Henrietta becoming the 3rd Duke of Marlborough), aunt Lady Diana Spencer (wife of the 4th Duke of Bedford). His mother was the third daughter and heiress of Lord President of the Council John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville and his first wife, Frances Worsley (a daughter of Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet). Among his maternal family were aunts Louisa Carteret (wife of the 2nd Viscount Weymouth), Grace Carteret (wife of the 4th Earl of Dysart), Frances Carteret (wife of the 4th Marquess of Tweeddale), and Sophia Carteret (wife of the 1st Marquess of Lansdowne). Spencer was the principal beneficiary under the will of his great-grandmother Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who stipulated, however, that should he at any time accept \\"from any King or Queen of these realms any pension, or any office or employment, civil or military\\" (except the Rangership of Windsor Great or Little Park), the estate would pass to the next heir \\"as if the same John Spencer were actually dead.\\"  Career  After going on a Grand Tour, Spencer returned to England where, in 1754, he was too young to stand for Parliament, but in return for James Grimston's election at St Albans, the Grimston family promised to support for him, or his nominee, on the next occasion. In March 1756 Spencer, standing on the Whig interest, but lost in the exceedingly expensive by-election at Bristol where Jarrit Smyth was elected. Nevertheless, Spencer was returned on 9 Dececember for Warwick, mainly on the interest of Lord Brooke (later the 1st Earl of Warwick). Spencer represented Warwick alongside Henry Archer. On 27 November 1760, Spencer wrote to the Duke of Newcastle, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, stating: > \\"As I am the representative of the Sunderland family, and as my particular > circumstances are such (from the Duchess of Marlborough's will) that I > cannot receive any favour from the King except a title, I should hope that > if his Majesty thinks me worthy of a peerage he will not confer upon me a > less dignity than that of a viscount... I hope your Grace has observed that > ever since I sat in Parliament I have never failed in supporting the King > and his ministers to the best of my ability.\\" Newcastle replied that the King had received the application, but that there would be no immediate creations. Therefore, he continued canvassing St Albans but toward the end of February 1761, he nominated Viscount Nuneham in his place, likely after being informed of his impending creation. On 3 April 1761, he was created Baron Spencer of Althorp and Viscount Spencer by King George III. Spencer went into Opposition with Newcastle in 1762, and when the Rockingham Government was being formed, Newcastle noted in his lists: \\"Viscount Spencer to be created an earl\\" which happened when he was created Viscount Althorp and Earl Spencer on 1 November 1765. Next, he adhered to the Chatham Administration. Lord Spencer later served as High Steward of St Albans in 1772 and Mayor of St Albans in 1779.  Personal life  Georgiana, George, and Henrietta, by Angelica Kauffman, 1774. In 1754, the twenty year-old Spencer met seventeen year-old Margaret Georgiana Poyntz, who was the daughter of the English diplomat and courtier Stephen Poyntz. The two were instantly attracted to one another, but Spencer was uncertain if he would have his family's approval for the match and opted to spend several months travelling until his twenty-first birthday, when their approval would no longer be necessary. On his return they recognised their love had persisted, and shortly after his birthday they married in a secret ceremony on 20 December 1755 at Althorp, the Spencer family seat in Northamptonshire. The ceremony, held in an upper bedroom, occurred during a ball held in Spencer's honour with five hundred guests in attendance. They had five children, three of whom survived infancy: * Lady Georgiana Spencer (1757‚Äì1806), who married William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. * George John Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer (1758‚Äì1834), who married Lady Lavinia Bingham, daughter of Charles Bingham, 1st Earl of Lucan. * Lady Henrietta Frances Spencer (1761‚Äì1821), who married Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough. * Lady Charlotte Spencer (1765‚Äì1766), who died in infancy. * Lady Louisa Spencer (1769‚Äì1769), who died in infancy. Spencer died aged 48, in 1783, near Bath. He had suffered from a long illness. He was buried in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Great Brington in Northamptonshire. His widow lived another thirty years before her death on 18 March 1814.

The Dreamcast video game console had several light guns released as accessories between the years of 2000 and 2003. The official light gun from Sega was released in Europe and Asia, but not in the United States due to concerns about bad press soon after the Columbine High School massacre. Instead, an officially licensed light gun was released by Mad Catz for the U.S. market. Several Dreamcast games support light guns, as well as various homebrew titles. The light guns work with a CRT TV or a CRT VGA monitor in 640x480 mode.  Official light guns Dreamcast Gun= The Dreamcast Gun is a light gun that was released only in Europe and Asia, where it is the official light gun for use. It works on American consoles, as all Dreamcast peripherals are region-free. However, American games such as Confidential Mission and House of the Dead 2, are region-locked and will not work with the Japanese gun, displaying a message like \\"This gun incompatible in North America\\" (HOTD2). Other North American releases, such as Virtua Cop 2 are not soft-locked. Not releasing and locking out the official gun in North America was an intentional move on Sega's part, who were worried about bad press after the Columbine High School massacre. Instead, Mad Catz released an officially licensed light gun in America, which does work with Sega's US gun games. The official European and Asian Dreamcast Gun does not work with any American games. American consoles can run Japanese games using this gun since it is the software that disallows the gun, not the console. The pistol-shaped gun has one expansion slot that is compatible with the VMU and the vibration pack. =Dream Blaster= Mad Catz's Dream Blaster is the official Dreamcast light gun for use in the United States. It features official Sega branding on the side of the gun and has a design mimicking the Dreamcast Gun. This gun also features an auto-reload feature. However, unlike the Star Fire Light Blaster, it lacks the delay, thus giving the player an infinite stream of ammunition. Unofficial light gunsStarFire LightBlaster= Interact's StarFire LightBlaster. This light gun was manufactured by Interact. This accessory features a directional pad on its left side and two start and B buttons on each side. It has an auto-reload trigger (located just in front of the gun trigger). With a Jump Pack plugged in, it can simulate recoil when shots are fired. The left side has a 4-way mode switch, they are 1. Normal, 2. Intelligent reload, 3. Auto fire, and 4. Auto reload plus Auto fire Modes. =SRC Bio Gun= SRC BIO GUN The Bio Gun is identical in form to the Saturn light gun, but is a beige color similar to the Dreamcast console. It incorporates auto fire and auto reload functions, has internal vibration, an 8-way directional pad, and B/Start buttons. If the \\"Silent Scope\\" mode is chosen with the mode selector, the player can control the scope with the 8-way directional pad at the side like with the analog stick on the normal pad. There is a mode selector switch at the side of the gun. The selector switch has two modes, auto and single fire. =Virtual Blaster= The Virtual Blaster is a third party \\"made in China\\" light gun for the Dreamcast. It bears the brand name Topmax. It looks very similar to the Dream Blaster except that it is slightly shorter and does not have a rubber grip. It has a small 8-directional D-Pad, B and START button on the back of the gun. There are 3 shooting modes: manual, auto-reload and auto-fire/reload (3-position slider button on the left side of the barrel). The auto-fire/reload does not have any delay. It has a VMU slot, but a rumble pack is unnecessary as it has a built- in vibration function that can be switched off with the 2-position slider button on the right side of the barrel. =DCX Blaster= The DCX Blaster is an almost exact clone of the original Dreamcast Gun, except that it is painted black and has minor stylistic variations. It features a single expansion slot and is compatible in all regions. It has variable firing configurations which include manual-reload & triggered-fire, auto-reload & triggered-fire, and auto-reload & auto-fire. =Hais DC Lightgun with Kick-Back= Hais DC Lightgun with Kick-Back has 3 modes of operation which are selected using a switch: \\"Normal\\" (single shot), \\"AR\\" (single shot with auto reload) and \\"AR+AF\\" (automatic fire with automatic reload). The gun features a kick-back feature where the slide actually kicks back and forth every shot (which can be disabled using a switch). For this functionality, however, the gun requires an additional power supply to be plugged into the gun's plug on the Dreamcast console. The gun is modeled after a Desert Eagle, and is white with orange buttons. There are also versions sold under the \\"Desert Eagle\\" label that are all black. There is no VMU slot. The gun features a D-pad and Start and B buttons beneath the barrel and an additional B Button is on the grip itself. Though the hammer is articulated, it has no function. Hais also released a Guncon 2 version for the PlayStation 2 =Hais DC Mini Gun= The Hais DC Mini Gun has both single shot and autofire capabilities and has a built-in vibration function (which can be disabled using a switch). The gun is small in comparison to other light guns for the Dreamcast. There are no expansion slots. The gun features a directional pad and Start and B buttons beneath the barrel. The trigger uses a plastic slide, as opposed to hinged triggers, which produce clicking noises. The orange plastic hammer of the gun is actually a functional button capable of triggering a secondary weapon. =Yobo Gameware DC Lightgun= Yobo DC Lightgun has 3 modes of operation which are selected using a switch: \\"Normal\\" (single shot), \\"AR\\" (single shot with auto reload) and \\"AF\\" (automatic fire with automatic reload). It also has a vibration on/off switch. It looks like the original Dreamcast Gun but bulkier. There is an expansion slot. The gun features a D-pad with Start and B buttons above the grip along with the trigger. =SRC DC Wireless Gun= This Dreamcast light gun was modeled after light guns traditionally used in arcades. It is wireless and uses a transmitter that utilizes infrared signals. The box gives these instructions: *For best results, the SRC DC should stay within four meters of the receiver *The distance between the receiver and the TV should not exceed one meter *The light gun uses one 9V battery to power the IR transmitter *The receiver has a mode selection switch that allows it to be used with Silent Scope =Pelican Stinger= A gun by Pelican. *Reload Trigger for rapid manual reloading of bullets *Built-in Jolt Action with On/Off Selector *Auto Reload Mode: Single fire with automatic bullet reload *Turbo Fire Mode: Turbo fire with automatic bullet reload *Rubberized Head Grips *Compatible with VMU and jump pack =ThrustMaster Pump Action Light gun= A gun by Thrustmaster (Thrust Master) *Black and white colours with THRUSTMASTER logo *Supports different modes of fire =Terra Nexus Light Gun= The gun is grey with orange buttons and carries the imprint \\"Terra Nexus 12mm\\" together with a switch on the side. The other side has a digital pad, three buttons and another switch. The front carries a red LED to simulate a laser targeting system.

John Murray was one of eight people arrested on 7 January 1990 in Belfast, Northern Ireland under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989; he was cautioned as specified in the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Following his arrest and over twelve interviews at Castlereagh, totaling over twenty-one hours in the next two days, Mr Murray refused to answer any questions despite being warned each time that \\"a court might draw such [common sense] inference[s] as appeared proper from his failure or refusal to do so\\". At the trial in May 1991 before the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, sitting without a jury, Mr Murray chose not to give evidence. As part of his decision the judge drew adverse inferences against the defendant under Articles 4 and 6 of the 1988 Order. Mr Murray was found guilty of aiding and abetting the false imprisonment of a police informer and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Mr Murray appealed to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland and lost on 7 July 1992. He had applied to the Commission in 1991, the case was referred to the ECtHR in 1994, heard on 20 June 1995 and the Court gave its opinion on 8 February 1996. Several groups filed written submissions including the Committee on the Administration of Justice, Amnesty International and the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Mr Murray complained that his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached, notably his right to silence during questioning and at trial, that the inferences from his silence were an integral part of the decision to find him guilty, the lack of access to a lawyer at the beginning of his detention and the different rights under the law in England and Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act. In the Convention these complaints refer to Article 6 paragraphs 1, 2, and 3c and also Article 14. The Commission found the reductions to the right of silence were not in breach of Article 6; the right was not absolute. The Court decided thus as Mr Murray was able to remain silent and this was not a criminal offence or contempt of court. It also found that the inferences could not be regarded as unfair given the presence of sufficient safeguards, the repeated warnings given during the interviews, the prima facie evidence against the accused, and Mr Murray's refusal to provide any explanation, and that the inferences were not a significant part of his conviction. His lack of early access to a lawyer was incompatible with the concept of fairness as it had placed the accused in a situation where his rights might be irretrievably prejudiced. Mr Murray was awarded ¬£15,000 towards his costs and expenses. The courts' decisions were by majority ‚Äì 14‚Äì5 in regard of no breach of Article 6(1) and 6(2), 12‚Äì7 in regard of a violation of 6(1) with 6(3c), and unanimously that it was not necessary to examine the applicant's complaint of a violation of 6(1) and 14.

History  The borders of Italy are mountainous terrain, so the Italian army has always had an interest in mountain artillery. However, by the 1930s much of Italy's mountain artillery was obsolescent and overdue for replacement. In 1934, the Italian firm of Ansaldo produced a new mountain howitzer design, the Obice da 75/18 modello 34, designed by Lt. Colonel Sergio Berlese who served in the Italian artillery. The modello 34 could be broken down into eight loads for transport. In the interest of standardization and logistics a version of the 75/18, the modello 35, was also used as the light howitzer component of normal field batteries. The modello 35 did not break down into smaller loads and had a split, rather than box, trail.Google Books: The Encyclopedia of Weapons The Italians sold the modello 35 abroad in order to obtain foreign currency. In 1940 a sizable batch was sold to Portugal, and more went to South American countries in exchange for raw materials. The gun was also used as the main armament of the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun where, due to its \\"Effetto Pronto\\" (HEAT) ammunition, it also had a good anti- tank capability. In 1941 some captured pieces were used against the Germans by the forces of the Commonwealth during the Battle of Crete and were probably present in the defence of Maleme airfield. Two of them are nowadays displayed next to the Battle of Crete monument in Heraklion.

He was murdered by the Nazis in 1941. Biography Halberstam was born in Bikofsk in 1874. His father was Shlomo Halberstam (1847‚Äì1905), the first Rebbe of Bobov, and a scion of the Divrei Chaim of Sanz (1798‚Äì1876). Upon his father's death Halberstam succeeded him as Rebbe. He authored a commentary on the Torah called Kedushas Tzion. Lvov, where Halberstam then lived, fell under Nazi control in July, 1941. For about a month Halberstam hid in a room whose door was secretly blocked by a large bookcase. But a friend convinced him to come out of hiding, on the theory that the Germans were harsher to people who were found hiding. The friend also argued that the Germans would honor Halberstam‚Äôs official papers that declared he was a foreign resident. On Friday, July 25, he left his place of hiding and established himself openly in a separate room in the apartment. Early in the morning of July 25, groups of peasants from nearby villages began to flow into Lvov. They assembled on the premises of police stations; set out from there to the streets accompanied by Ukrainian policemen, and assaulted any Jew whom they encountered with clubs, knives and axes. Groups of Jews were taken to the Jewish cemetery and murdered brutally. A roundup of Jews from their homes, coupled with looting, began in the afternoon. The proportion of Jewish intellectuals was high. Ukrainian police circulated in groups of five and consulted prepared lists. The pogrom was known as the \\"Petliura Days\\" in commemoration of Symon Petliura. For three days, Ukrainian mobs went on a rampage through the Jewish districts of Lvov. They took groups of Jews to the Jewish cemetery and to Lunecki prison and shot them. At about 6 p.m. that very day the door opened suddenly and a Ukrainian youth entered together with the building‚Äôs gentile superintendent. The youth carried a red whip with the insignia of the Symon Petliura bands. The youth ordered Halberstam to accompany him. His youngest son, Moshe Aaron, pleaded to come along to help his father, and was eventually allowed to. They were joined on the street corner by other distinguished prisoners from other areas in the city. Soldiers stood guard to prevent escape. When the number of captives reached a hundred, the guards arranged them in a row, three abreast, and ordered them to march. Halberstam was too weak to keep up with the rapid pace and moved to the back. The guards beat him with their batons and demanded that he hurry up. An eye-witness writes that \\"he saw from his window how the Rebbe, dressed in his Sabbath clothing was attacked by the soldiers. The cruel Ukrainians beat him on his head with their rifle-butts and his yarmulke fell to the ground. From time to time the Rebbe bent over and stooped to pick it up, and they beat him even more.\\" (Eilah Azkerah by Naftoli Eherenberg, v. 1, ed., page 141) The next day there was another action. The captives this time included three of Halberstam's sons-in-law: Rabbi Yecheskel Halberstam (son of Rabbi Yeshayale Tchechoiver), Rabbi Moshe Stempel, and Rabbi Shlome Rubin. On Monday July 28, the Jewish captives were shot in the Yanover forest behind the city. Twenty thousand Jews were shot that day; Halberstam, his son and his three sons-in-law included. He was succeeded by his son Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (1907‚Äì2000), who rebuilt Bobov in the United States. Descendants Halberstam married his cousin, Chaya Fradel Halberstam, daughter of Rabbi Shalom Eliezer of Ratzfert, who was a son of the Divrei Chaim of Sanz. Together they had eleven children: 1) Devorah Leah Halberstam (1900-1995) married her cousin, Yaakov Yisrael Twerski from Hornistipol, who later became the Rov in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. and the Rebbe and successor of the Hornosteipel (Hasidic dynasty) (1898-1973).

The terms F_x and F_{x'} are sometimes called the positive and negative Shannon cofactors, respectively, of F with respect to x. These are functions, computed by restrict operator, \\\\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 0) and \\\\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 1) (see valuation (logic) and partial application). It has been called the \\"fundamental theorem of Boolean algebra\\".Paul C. Rosenbloom, The Elements of Mathematical Logic, 1950, p. 5 Besides its theoretical importance, it paved the way for binary decision diagrams, satisfiability solvers, and many other techniques relevant to computer engineering and formal verification of digital circuits. Statement of the theorem A more explicit way of stating the theorem is: : f(X_1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) = X_1 \\\\cdot f(1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) + X_1' \\\\cdot f(0, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n)  Variations and implications  ; XOR-Form : The statement also holds when the disjunction \\"+\\" is replaced by the XOR operator: : f(X_1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) = X_1 \\\\cdot f(1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) \\\\oplus X_1' \\\\cdot f(0, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) ; Dual form: There is a dual form of the Shannon expansion (which does not have a related XOR form): : f(X_1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n) = (X_1 + f(0, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n)) \\\\cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2, \\\\dots , X_n)) Repeated application for each argument leads to the Sum of Products (SoP) canonical form of the Boolean function f. For example for n=2 that would be :\\\\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) & = X_1 \\\\cdot f(1, X_2) + X_1' \\\\cdot f(0, X_2) & = X_1 X_2 \\\\cdot f(1, 1) + X_1 X_2' \\\\cdot f(1, 0) + X_1' X_2 \\\\cdot f(0, 1) + X_1' X_2' \\\\cdot f(0, 0) \\\\end{align} Likewise, application of the dual form leads to the Product of Sums (PoS) canonical form (using the distributivity law of + over \\\\cdot): :\\\\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) & = (X_1 + f(0, X_2)) \\\\cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2)) & = (X_1 + X_2 + f(0, 0)) \\\\cdot (X_1 + X_2' + f(0, 1)) \\\\cdot (X_1' + X_2 + f(1, 0)) \\\\cdot (X_1' + X_2' + f(1, 1)) \\\\end{align}  Properties of cofactors  ; Linear properties of cofactors: : For a boolean function F which is made up of two boolean functions G and H the following are true: : If F = H' then F_x = H'_x : If F = G \\\\cdot H then F_x = G_x \\\\cdot H_x : If F = G + H then F_x = G_x + H_x : If F = G \\\\oplus H then F_x = G_x \\\\oplus H_x ; Characteristics of unate functions: : If F is a unate function and... : If F is positive unate then F = x \\\\cdot F_x + F_{x'} : If F is negative unate then F = F_x + x' \\\\cdot F_{x'}  Operations with cofactors  ; Boolean difference: : The boolean difference or boolean derivative of the function F with respect to the literal x is defined as: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} = F_x \\\\oplus F_{x'} ; Universal quantification: : The universal quantification of F is defined as: : \\\\forall x F = F_x \\\\cdot F_{x'} ; Existential quantification: : The existential quantification of F is defined as: : \\\\exists x F = F_x + F_{x'} History George Boole presented this expansion as his Proposition II, \\"To expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols\\", in his Laws of Thought (1854),George Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought: On which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, 1854, p. 72 full text at Google Books and it was \\"widely applied by Boole and other nineteenth-century logicians\\".Frank Markham Brown, Boolean Reasoning: The Logic of Boolean Equations, 2nd edition, 2003, p. 42 Claude Shannon mentioned this expansion, among other Boolean identities, in a 1948 paper,Claude Shannon, \\"The Synthesis of Two-Terminal Switching Circuits\\", Bell System Technical Journal 28:59‚Äì98, full text, p. 62 and showed the switching network interpretations of the identity. In the literature of computer design and switching theory, the identity is often incorrectly attributed to Shannon. Application to switching circuits # Binary decision diagrams follow from systematic use of this theorem # Any Boolean function can be implemented directly in a switching circuit using a hierarchy of basic multiplexer by repeated application of this theorem.

He was the son of Abu Kalijar. Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì11th centuries  Reign  Independent rule = Upon his father's death, he took the throne in Baghdad with the title \\"al-Malik al-Rahim\\". His succession to the entire Buyid Empire was prevented by his brother Abu Mansur Fulad Sutun, who took control of Fars. The two then entered into a struggle for supremacy. During this period Al-Malik al-Rahim appointed the Fasanjas Ala al-Din Abu'l-Ghana'im Sa'd as his vizier. In 1049, Al-Malik al-Rahim sent an army under his brother Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, who managed to capture Shiraz and also capture Abu Mansur. However, Abu Sa'd Khusrau was shortly forced back to Iraq due to increased hostility between the Turks and the Dailamite troops there. At about the same time, the Buyid lands in Oman were permanently lost. Abu Mansur then managed to become the ruler of Fars once again, and captured parts of Ahvaz from Al-Malik al-Rahim. Al-Malik al-Rahim, however, managed to recapture Ahvaz and seize another town named Askar Mukram from Abu Mansur. The next year, a combined army of Arab and Kurdish tribes, ravaged Ahvaz and its surrounding regions, but were later repelled by Al-Malik al-Rahim. In 1051 or 1052, Al-Malik al-Rahim once again defeated Abu Mansur and captured Fars. He then appointed Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, as governor of the province. Shiraz, however was lost in 1053 or 1054, when Abu Mansur returned as a vassal to the Seljuk ruler Toghr√ºl. In 1055, a Dailamite military leader named Fuladh, captured Shiraz and repelled Abu Mansur from Fars. Fuladh then made an agreement with Al-Malik al-Rahim where he agreed to acknowledge his authority. However, Al-Malik al-Rahim and Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, did not trust him, and along with Abu Mansur, reconquered Shiraz from Fuladh. Abu Mansur then agreed to acknowledge the authority of Al-Malik al-Rahim. = Seljuq suzerainty = Toghr√ºl, however, soon decided to put an end to the Buyid state in Iraq. On December 17, 1055, he arrived in Baghdad as a pilgrim on his way to Mecca, and made it known that after he returned, he would make war with the Fatimids. The Abbasid caliph, who had initially preferred the weak Buyids over the strong Seljuks despite the latter's Sunni orthodoxy, declared that Toghr√ºl's name should be recited before the al-Malik al-Rahim in the Friday sermons. The amir thereupon became a vassal of the Seljuks. Barely a week had passed, however, before the citizens of Baghdad began to complain to the amir about looting committed by the Seljuk troops, asking him to expel them out of the city. Toghr√ºl then summoned him to his camp to negotiate over the issue. When he arrived, he was accused of acts of retribution against the Seljuk troops, and was arrested over the caliph's protests. Al-Malik al-Rahim was the last Buyid ruler of Iraq. He died a prisoner in Ray in 1058 or 1059.

He represented the xingyi martial philosophy of preferring to become highly proficient with only a few techniques rather than to be less proficient with many techniques. His skill with one technique Beng Quan was legendary: it was said from him that \\"with his 'half-step bengquan', he could fight anyone under heaven without finding an equal.\\" (banbu bengquan da yu tianxia wu dishou), and earned the nickname \\"the steadfast\\" (bu daota). Although it is not historically reliable, he is said to have fought Dong Hai Chuan, the founder of baguazhang, whereby neither was able to defeat the other. The outcome of their purported match was that practitioners of both arts each highly respected the others. In another version of this story, Guo Yunshen, desiring to fight Dong Hai Chuan, he first went to visit Cheng Tinghua, another native of Hebei province. Cheng invited Guo to dinner. Guo demonstrated his \\"Divine Crushing Fist\\", which Cheng evaded twice. Because of this, he rethought his plan to challenge Dong, knowing him to be a superior practitioner to Cheng. His teaching was based on the \\"three truths\\" (san li), the \\"three capacities\\" (san gong), the \\"three methods\\" (san fa) and the single/double weight notion (danzhong/shuangzhong) during santishi standing practice. His students should stand still for at least three years before they could learn the forms. Guo Yunshen had learned with Li Luo Neng and was also a member of the Hebei xingyiquan school.

Early life Naftali Tzvi Halberstam was born in Bobowa, Poland in 1931 (25 Sivan, 5691) to Shlomo Halberstam, the third Bobover Rebbe. His mother and two siblings were murdered in the Holocaust, and after the war, Naftali's father Shlomo had arranged for him to go to Mandatory Palestine. Shlomo remained in Europe, and Naftali was unsure if his father had survived the war. Post-war Halberstam lived for several years in Israel, where he received his rabbinical ordination. After the war, he discovered that his father had indeed survived and relocated to New York. In the late 1940s, he moved there, where he was reunited with his father. On his father's death in 2000, he became the Grand Rebbe of Bobov in Borough Park, Brooklyn. He died on March 23, 2005 (12 Adar, 5765). Halberstam was buried next to his father in Floral Park Cemetery, New Jersey. Halberstam's wife, Rebbetzin Hesa, died on May 15, 2011 (11 Iyar, 5771) aged 80. Halberstam left no sons, only two daughters. His older daughter is married to Yehoshua Rubin, the current Bobov-45 dayan (judge).

Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence. A person's ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as patience, impulse control, self-control and willpower, all of which are involved in self-regulation. Broadly, self- regulation encompasses a person's capacity to adapt the self as necessary to meet demands of the environment. Delaying gratification is the reverse of delay discounting, which is \\"the preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards\\" and refers to the \\"fact that the subjective value of reward decreases with increasing delay to its receipt\\". It is theorized that the ability to delay rewards is under the control of the cognitive- affective personality system (CAPS). Several factors can affect a person's ability to delay gratification. Cognitive strategies, such as the use of distracting or \\"cool\\" thoughts, can increase delay ability, as can neurological factors, such as strength of connections in the frontal-striatal pathway. Behavioral researchers have focused on the contingencies that govern choices to delay reinforcement, and have studied how to manipulate those contingencies in order to lengthen delay. Age plays a role too; children under five years old demonstrate a marked lack of delayed gratification ability and most commonly seek immediate gratification. A very small difference between males and females suggest that females may be better at delaying rewards. The ability to wait or seek immediate reinforcement is related to avoidance- related behaviors such as procrastination, and to other clinical diagnoses such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic theory, discussed the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, or a lack of ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill. BackgroundCognitive-affective processing system= One well-supported theory of self-regulation, called the Cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS), suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use \\"cool\\" regulatory strategies (i.e., calm, controlled and cognitive strategies) over \\"hot regulatory strategies (i.e., emotional, impulsive, automatic reactions), when faced with provocation. In \\"hot\\" processing, a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation, and especially about its most appealing elements, and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward. The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior. Effective \\"cool\\" strategies involve distraction and restructuring the perception of the tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing. For example, in one study of pre-adolescent boys with behavioral problems, the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used \\"cool\\" strategies, such as looking away or distracting themselves. The most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward, which takes attention away from the immediate temptations. =Stanford marshmallow experiment= The seminal research on delayed gratification ‚Äì the now-famous \\"marshmallow experiment\\" ‚Äì was conducted by Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year- olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: \\"small reward now, bigger reward later.\\" Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain \\"cool\\" distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs, or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste). The children who waited longer, when re-evaluated as teenagers and adults, demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers. As teenagers, they had higher SAT scores, social competence, self- assuredness and self-worth, and were rated by their parents as more mature, better able to cope with stress, more likely to plan ahead, and more likely to use reason. They were less likely to have conduct disorders or high levels of impulsivity, aggressiveness and hyperactivity. As adults, the high delayers were less likely to have drug problems or other addictive behaviors, get divorced, or be overweight. Each minute that a preschooler was able to delay gratification translated to a .2% reduction in Body Mass Index 30 years later. Each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward in favor of a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings. Forty years after the first marshmallow test studies, neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification. A team led by B. J. Casey, of Cornell University, recruited 59 of the original participants ‚Äì who are now in their mid-40s ‚Äì and gave them a delayed gratification task. Instead of resisting marshmallows, these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces, but not to neutral or fearful faces. Those who had been high delayers as pre- schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces (i.e., not pressing the button in response to happy faces), suggesting that the high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses. Casey and colleagues also scanned the brains of 26 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they completed the task. The researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use \\"cool\\" regulation strategies to control their responses, which would manifest as activation of the right prefrontal cortex, whereas low delayers would use \\"hot\\" strategies, which would activate the ventral striatum, an area also linked to addiction. Indeed, results showed this differential brain activity. This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah Shamosh and Jeremy Gray, of Yale University, demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards (in hypothetical situations) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex. Factors affecting one's abilityNeurocognitive factors= The way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision's outcome. Research on \\"hot\\" and \\"cool\\" strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on the reward's arousing, \\"hot\\" qualities (taste, smell, sound, feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, \\"cool\\" qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self- control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, \\"hot\\" qualities of a competing item. For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes. Delaying gratification is the same as controlling the impulse for immediate gratification, which requires cognitive control. The ventral striatum, located in the midbrain, is the part of the limbic system that is the reward center as well as a pleasure center. The limbic system will always react to the potential for instant pleasure. To override this instinct, the prefrontal cortex, which is also associated with reasoning and rational thought, must be active. The prefrontal cortex is also the part of the brain that determines the focus of a person's attention, which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification. During adolescence and early adulthood, the prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with the rest of the brain. Older children and adults find the deferment-of-gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason. However, the relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development. Children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control. Practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life. =Behavioral factors= Behaviorists focus on the acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior. Behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill. It has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely. Behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a short amount of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time. Individual thresholds for delay In a 2011 study, researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on the amount of money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain. Duration of time delay The duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180‚Äì300 months (15‚Äì25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, the bulk of the participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait. Behavioral training=Applications in classroom settings= In a Year 3 elementary classroom in South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place. The study gave limits on the numbers of questions the children could ask, and if they did not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking. =Applications to ADHD= Compared to neurotypical children, those with ADHD generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by the frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through the implementation of a simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, three children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of the quality of the reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post- assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement. =Across the lifespan= At birth, infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems. Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies. Effects of gender Throughout 33 studies on gender differences, a small significant effect (r = .06) has been found indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior. This effect may be related to the slight gender differences found in delay discounting (i.e., minimizing the value of a delayed reward) and higher levels of impulsivity and inattention in boys. Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age (e.g., puberty) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan. Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does. =Clinical factors=Contemporary clinical psychology perspectives Self-control has been called the \\"master virtue\\" by clinical and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall psychological adjustment. People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self- esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations. Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder. Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology. A growing body of research suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse- control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation ‚Äì which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change. = Externalizing disorders = Externalizing disorders (i.e., acting-out disorders) show a clearer link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. A 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation. = Internalizing disorders = Difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly. Psychoanalytic drives and impulses Sigmund Freud viewed the struggle to delay gratification as a person's efforts to overcome the instinctive, libidinal drive of the id. According to classic psychoanalytic theory, a person's psyche is composed of the id, ego and superego. The id is driven by the pleasure principle: it wants physical pleasure, and it wants it now. The ego, operating under the reality principle, serves to moderate the id's desire for instant gratification against the superego, which is guided by a person's internalized sense of morality. According to psychoanalytic theory, a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by intrapsychic conflict ‚Äì the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego ‚Äì and experiences psychological distress, often in the form of anxiety or \\"neurosis\\". Other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. David C. Funder and Jack Block theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses. Ego control \\"ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other\\", according to Funder. These tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will \\"grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain\\" and someone who tends toward overcontrol will \\"delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost\\". By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly in other settings. Funder and Block draw a distinction between the ego-control model, in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses (whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance), and the ego- resiliency model (supported by Mischel's research), in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive. To tease apart these models, Funder and Block explored the association between ego control, ego resiliency, IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents. The adolescents had the choice between being paid $4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session, in which case they would also earn an addition $4 of \\"interest\\". The results supported both models of delayed gratification. The teens' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency (e.g., higher delayers were rated as more responsible, consistent, likable, sympathetic, generous; less hostile, moody, self-indulgent, rebellious), but was also independently associated with ego control (e.g., higher delayers were rated as \\"tends toward over-control of needs and impulses\\" and \\"favors conservative values in a number of areas\\"). The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control (i.e., overall impulsivity) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating. Writing in 1998, Funder described delayed gratification as a \\"mixed bag\\". He concluded: \\"Participants who exhibited the most delay were not just 'better' at self-control, but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it. [...] Delayers are in general smart and well-adjusted, but they also tend to be somewhat overcontrolled and unnecessarily inhibited.\\" =Environmental and social factors=Who is in control Factors affecting one's ability to delay gratification depend on whether the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at the will of the person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances. Task engagement Engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration‚Äîakin to teasing‚Äîrather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it. Mother‚Äìchild relationship The more positive emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency. Reliability of gratification Researchers have investigated whether the reliability of the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification. Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be \\"found\\" and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of three minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows. =Genetics and evolution= Evolutionary theory can argue against the selection of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time that could be used to find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage. It is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification. Animal studies Delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, marmosets, rats, and pigeons. =Delay discounting= When animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the discounting of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay. To test for this theory, they gave the same test while varying the time between the opportunities to choose a reward. They found that as the interval increased, the number of times that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased. While this occurred in macaque monkeys, the varying interval time did not affect pigeons' choices in another study. This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed. When provided a choice between a small, short delay reward, and a large, long delay reward, there is an impulsive preference for the former. Additionally, as the delay time for the small/short and large/long reward increases, there is a shift in preference toward the larger, delayed reward. This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting, not exponential. =Ecological factors= Although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models, there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect the delayed gratification behavior of animals. In real world situations, \\"discounting makes sense because of the inherent uncertainty of future payoffs\\". One study looked at how reward discounting is context specific. By differing the time and space between small and large rewards, they were able to test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances. The physiological similarities between humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.

Bertie was Lady Willoughby de Eresby's second husband, the first being Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. Peregrine Bertie's half-brothers, Henry and Charles Brandon, died as teenagers four years before his birth. His sister Susan married the Earl of Kent and then the nephew of Bess of Hardwick. Owing to religious politics, the parents had to move outside England and the boy was born at Wesel on the River Rhine. Early life Born on 12 October 1555, he was baptized at the church of Saint Willibrord in Wesel on 14 October. On Elizabeth I's accession to the throne in 1558, his parents returned to England and applied for a patent of naturalization for him. He formally became English on 2 August 1559. He married Mary de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, between Christmas 1577 and 12 March 1578.Nelson p. 179 When his mother died in 1580, he succeeded to her barony and he took his seat in the House of Lords on 16 January 1580. Diplomat and soldier In 1582, he was commissioned to escort the Duke of Anjou from Canterbury to Antwerp. The French royal duke had arrived as a suitor of the un-married Elizabeth. In the same year he was sent to Denmark to invest Frederick II with the Order of the Garter. Lord Willoughby de Eresby arrived at Elsinore on 22 July and left on 27 September 1582. His ulterior purpose was to obtain an understanding whereby English merchant ships would not be molested while in Danish waters. In 1585, he returned to Denmark on behalf of Elizabeth in support of Henry III of Navarre and to obtain Danish help for England's efforts on behalf of the independent Netherlands. These journeys were made at Bertie's expense as his correspondence with Francis Walsingham made clear; he was becoming desperate to be paid or to escape from the diplomatic duties. After two and a half months of working on the Danish king, Bertie got him to offer to try to persuade the Spanish king to retire from the Low Countries. Frederick also agreed to send 2,000 horse to back up the English force already in the Netherlands. On achieving this much, Peregrine set off for England by way of Hamburg, Emden and Amsterdam. From March 1586 Bertie served in the Netherlands as governor of Bergen-op-Zoom under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester,Adams p. 326 who was Governor-General of the United Provinces. After Leicester's departure for England in December 1586, he was made general of the English forces. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Zutphen but redeemed himself with his victory at the Siege of Bergen. Subsequently, he fought for the Huguenots under Henry of Navarre. He commanded the English contingent at Henry's Siege of Paris in 1590. Bertie's final appointment was Governor of Berwick upon Tweed on the Scottish border and Warden of the East March in 1598, displacing Robert Carey. At the request of Robert Cecil he organised the kidnapping of Edmund Ashfield, an Englishman visiting James VI of Scotland. Peregrine died on 25 June 1601 at Berwick and was buried at St. James Church, Spilsby, Lincolnshire.Ridpath, George, The Border History of England and Scotland, Mercat Press (repr. 1984), 477, 480. He had married (and separated from) Mary de Vere, the daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford. They had at least three sons: Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey (d. 1642), Sir Peregrine Bertie (d. 1639), and Henry Bertie of Lound (d. 1655).

Gilpin is known for her photographs of Native Americans, particularly the Navajo and Pueblo, and Southwestern landscapes. Gilpin began taking photographs as a child in Colorado and formally studied photography in New York from 1916 to 1917 before returning to her home in Colorado to begin her career as a professional photographer. Life Gilpin was the daughter of Frank Gilpin and Emma Miller. Frank was a cattle rancher from Philadelphia, while Emma grew up in St. Louis and Chicago. Although Emma moved to Colorado to be with her husband, she longed for the more cultured surroundings of big cities. When Gilpin was born, her parents had to travel to a home in Austin Bluffs, some from their ranch at Horse Creek because this was the location that was closest to a doctor. As this was her first child Mrs. Gilpin wanted to ensure the safety of her daughter in any way possible. Gilpin enjoyed exploring the outdoors as a child, and her father encouraged her to go camping and hiking in the Colorado landscape. Gilpin's father took several jobs during her childhood, and in 1902 he moved to Durango, Mexico to manage a mine. Several months after he moved there Gilpin's mother joined him, leaving their two children (Laura and her brother) in the care of the directors of Gilpin's school, Mr. and Mrs. William Stark. In 1903, for her twelfth birthday, Gilpin received a Kodak Brownie Camera (and later received a developing tank for Christmas). Gilpin used this camera incessantly for several years. She considered the year 1904 to be a very important point in her life. During this year, Gilpin's mother sent her to visit her closest friend and Gilpin's namesake, Laura Perry, in St. Louis. Gilpin was there during the great Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Perry was blind, and it was Gilpin's task to describe every exhibit to her in detail. They visited the fair every other day for a month, and she later said \\"The experience taught me the kind of observation I would have never learned otherwise.\\" Rancho de Taos Mission, New Mexico Gilpin's mother encouraged her at an early age to study music, and she was educated at eastern boarding schools, including the New England Conservatory of Music, from 1904‚Äì1908. On her first trip to the East her mother took her to New York to have her portrait taken by well-known photographer Gertrude K√§sebier. Later when she decided to become a photographer, Gilpin asked K√§sebier to be her mentor. Over the years they developed a lifelong friendship. When family finances declined, Gilpin left school and returned to Colorado. She enjoyed exploring the outdoors, and she would often visit General William Jackson Palmer, who took her horseback riding and walking around the surrounding areas of their home. On these excursions Palmer would teach the Gilpin about the plants, animals, and other wildlife that they would encounter, laying the foundation for her passion for the landscape, which would become the subject of many of her photographs. In an attempt to support her growing interest in photography, Gilpin started a business raising turkeys at her family's ranch. Her poultry business was widely successful and was featured in a Denver newspaper in 1913. She was able to use the proceeds from raising turkeys to fund trips to the East Coast to further her skills in photography. While she formally studied photography on the East Coast, Gilpin worked on her autochrome skills whenever possible from home as well. She photographed everything from her chickens and turkeys to her brother and the landscape. She eventually sold the turkey operation and continued to push her photography career forward. In 1916 she moved to New York to study photography, but she returned to Colorado Springs in 1918 after becoming seriously ill from influenza. Her mother hired a nurse, Elizabeth Warham Forster \\"Betsy\\", to care for her. Gilpin and Forster became friends and, later, companions. Gilpin frequently photographed Forster during the more than fifty years they were together, sometimes placing her in scenes with other people as though she were part of a tableau she happened to come upon. They remained together, with occasional separations necessitated by available jobs, until Forster's death in 1972.Michael Ann Sullivan: Laura Gilpin 1891-1979 After Gilpin recovered she opened her own commercial photography studio in Colorado Springs. In 1924 the Pictorial Photographers of America awarded Gilpin her first New York show. Evergreen Cemetery, Laura Gilpin In 1924, Gilpin's mother died and she was left to care for her father who continued to move from job to job. Between 1942 and 1944 she lived in Wichita, Kansas, where she worked for the Boeing Company photographing airplanes. She left there in 1944, shortly after her father's death, and returned to her beloved Colorado. She continued working and photography throughout the Southwest until her death in 1979. Gilpin is buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Colorado Springs. Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Warham Forster (1886-1972) is buried in the same cemetery, albeit in a different plot. Education and career as a photographer Gilpin made her earliest dated autochrome in 1908 when she was 17 years old. This photography technique had only become widely available that year, which is a testament to Gilpin's early dedication to photography. In 1915, she traveled to the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco expositions as a companion for a friend of her mother's. At these expositions, Gilpin developed an interest in sculpture, architecture, and native cultures. She later recalled that \\"There was practically no art interest in Colorado Springs in those early days...I remember Harvey Young was the only painter in town and I don't think there was a sculptor. I knew nothing about sculpture.\\" Gilpin took a large quantity of photographs here, some of which became the first she had published. Her photograph of the Cloister at the San Diego Exposition became her first prize-winning photograph. She won a monthly competition that was sponsored by American Photography magazine in May 1916. What interested Gilpin about architecture and sculpture was the way light interacted with the three- dimensional forms. Beginning in 1916, Gilpin lived with Brenda Putnam, a sculptor who was living, sculpting, and teaching in New York City at the time. Their time as roommates was the beginning of what would become a lifelong friendship for Gilpin and Putnam, who supported each other's work and discussed art often. Gilpin studied sculpture with Putnam, and would often photograph her works. The two artists stayed in close contact even after Gilpin left New York for Colorado and New Mexico. When Gilpin decided she wanted to seriously study photography, her mentor Gertrude K√§sebier advised her to attend the Clarence White School in New York City. She enrolled in a 28-week course in October 1916, and greatly expanded her photographic knowledge and skill. She deeply admired White, whom she later called \\"one of the greatest teachers I have ever known in any field\\". White believed that while taking a good photograph involved an investment in emotional feeling, a student could also be taught to take a good photograph. For White, being a good photographer was not something that was innate. White also did not separate the notion of art photography and commercial photography. At the Clarence White School, Gilpin learned about photographic processes and alternative printing methods, including platinum printing, a process she would work with throughout her career. Gilpin spent the summer following her first school year at Clarence White School in Colorado Springs and then moved back to New York in the Fall of 1917. Shortly after, she contracted influenza and was unable to take photos for six months. She came under the care of Elizabeth Forster, a nurse, who became her lifelong friend and companion. When she was well again she began working and taking photos again but never went back to school, and her period of formal study of art came to an end. As Gilpin began her professional career in 1918 she received much support from her parents. The subject matter of her early works included portraits of acquaintances and landscapes local to Colorado Springs. Laura joined a circle of artists in Colorado Springs that were associated with the Broadmoor Art Academy in 1919. Gilpin produced photographic brochures for the school. During this time, Gilpin's primary source of work was printing platinum portraits of local people who preferred the cost of photographs to having their portraits painted. In an attempt to focus on the natural spirit of her sitters, Gilpin preferred to use more relaxed poses and relied on soft natural light for these portraits. Laura spent 1920-1921 studying portrait sculpture in New York with Brenda Putnam in an attempt to improve her portrait photographs. While Gilpin did submit still lifes and portraits to exhibitions and competitions, the larger part of Gilpin's success stemmed from the popularity of her western landscape photographs. Her interest in the western landscape originated with her upbringing in Colorado Springs, but was expanded when she stopped in Santa Fe on the way to Mexico with her father and visited the Museum of New Mexico. In 1922, Gilpin made a trip to Europe that later impacted her work. After this trip she began to respect and experiment more with sharp-focused photography, and became interested in creating photographic books after encountering the work of William Blake. Her experiences in Europe also expanded her knowledge of art and art history, and helped to solidify her identity as a western American individual. This experience with self-identification furthered her interest in the western landscape. Her work was enhanced by visits to the Navajo reservation in Red Rock Arizona where Elizabeth Forster had taken a job as a public health nurse.Forster, E. W., Gilpin, L., & Sandweiss, M. A. (1988). Denizens of the desert: A tale in word and picture of life among the Navaho Indians. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press. Gilpin is considered to be one of the great platinum printing photographers, and many of her platinum prints are now in museums around the world. She said \\"I have always loved the platinum printing process. It's the most beautiful image one can get. It has the longest scale and one can get the greatest degree of contrast. It's not a difficult process; it just takes time.\\" Over a thirty- year period from 1945-1975 her work was seen in more than one hundred one- person and group exhibits. Gilpin's work is archived at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. She continued to be very active as a photographer and as a participant in the Santa Fe arts scene until her death in 1979. Gilpin's photographic and literary archives are now housed at the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas.

The invasion was led by Cissa's father √Ülle and included his two brothers. They are said to have fought against the local Britons. Their conquest of what became Sussex, England continued when they fought a battle on the margins of Mecredesburne in 485 and Pevensey in 491 where they are said to have slaughtered their opponents to the last man. The main source for this story is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a series of annals written in the vernacular Old English. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle was commissioned in the reign of Alfred the Great some 400 years after the landing at Cymenshore. One of the purposes of the chronicle was to provide genealogies of the West Saxon kings. Although a lot of the facts provided by the chronicle can be verified, the foundation story of Sussex involving √Ülle and his three sons can not. It is known that Anglo-Saxons did settle in eastern Sussex during the fifth century, but not in the west where Cymensora was probably situated. The city of Chichester, whose placename is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, of AD 895, is supposedly named after Cissa. Historical attestation The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle lists Cissa as one of the three sons of √Ülle, who in the year 477 arrived in Britain at a place called Cymenshore (traditionally thought to have been in the Selsey area of SussexKelly. Anglo-Saxon Charters VI. pp. 3-13.). The Chronicle recounts that √Ülle and his three sons fought three battles: at Cymenshore in 477, one near the banks of Mercredesburne in 485 and lastly one at Pevensey in 491, where (the Chronicle claims) all Britons were slaughtered.Welch. Early Anglo Saxon Sussex in Brandon's South Saxons p. 24 - Mercredesburne means \\"river of the frontier agreed by treaty\\"ASC 477, 485, 491 - English translation at project Gutenberg. Retrieved 5 March 2013Jones.The End of Roman Britain. p.71. - ..the repetitious entries for invading ships in the Chronicle (three ships of Hengest and Horsa; three ships of Aella; five ships of Cerdic and Cynric; two ships of Port; three ships of Stuf and Wihtgar), drawn from preliterate traditions including bogus eponyms and duplications, might be considered a poetic convention. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was originally compiled in Winchester, the capital of Wessex, and completed in 891. It was then distributed to various monasteries throughout the country for copying. The different versions were then updated periodically. The chronicle texts chart Anglo-Saxon history from the mid-fifth century until 1154. Before the Norman Conquest of 1066 the manuscripts were mainly written in Old English; post- Conquest the scribes tended to use Latin.Gransden. Historical Writing. pp.36-39Asser. Alfred the Great. pp. 275 - 281. - Discussion of sources, authors, dates and accuracy The original Chronicle was commissioned during the rule of Alfred the Great over 400 years after Cissa, and historians regard the accuracy of the events and dates listed during the fifth century as questionable.Morris. Dark Age Dates. p.153 - Morris compares a list of known dates with Gildas and Bede's record, he explains that Gildas's date was about 20 years later than the actual date on a lot of the events. Bede took the Gildas date for his reference. The sources for the fifth century annals are obscure, however an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that the narrative derived from an oral tradition, such as sagas in the form of epic poems. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was commissioned for a number of reasons, including propaganda‚Äîit provided genealogies of the kings of Wessex, showing them in a positive light. (Wessex had absorbed the Kingdom of Sussex, founded by √Ülle, during the reign of Egbert of Wessex .) No known archaeological evidence supports the existence of √Ülle and his three sons in the Chichester or Selsey area.Welch. Early Anglo-Saxons in Brandon's The South Saxons Chapter 11 - a discussion of the Anglo-Saxons in 5th century Sussex. The absence of early Anglo-SaxonKipfer. Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology. p. 23. - The Early or Pagan Saxon period was from the early settlements until the general acceptance of Christianity in the mid 7th century. The mid period was from the 7th to 9th century and the late period was until the Norman conquest of 1066. burial-grounds in the Chichester area indicates that the Saxons did not arrive there until more than a hundred years after √Ülle's traditional lifetime;D J Freke. (1980) Excavations in the Parish Church of St Thomas the Martyr, Pagham, SAC 118 pp. 245-56 - A late-6th- century or early-7th-century cremation urn was found near the church in Pagham Harbour Some have proposed that Chichester had an independent region of Britons (known as Sub-Roman) in the late fifth century, but no archaeological or placename evidence supports that hypothesis either.Down. Archaeology in Sussex to AD1500. p.56 - The absence of any early Saxon cemeteries or artefacts in or near Chichester, as far as present knowledge goes, is another piece of negative evidence which may lead in the end to the conclusion that, for whatever reason, a sub-Roman enclave existed in and around the old civitas, possibly as late as the early 7th century.Bell. Saxon Sussex in Archaeology in Sussex to AD 1500: p.64. - This has led some writers to suggest that an area centred on Chichester remained in sub-Roman hands, throughout the 5th century and perhaps longer. Equally, however, there is no archaeological evidence from Chichester or its surroundings of a sub-Roman population.Dodgson. Place-Names in Sussex in Brandon's. The South Saxons. pp. 54-88. - No placenames of Romano-British origin in the Chichester area.Gelling. Landscape of Place-Names p.236. Chithurst is possibly a hybrid of the British Chit and OE hyrstSlaughter.(2009) in his reconstruction hypothesis the Rulers of the South Saxons before 825, raises the point of negative evidence in terms of any possible sub-Roman presence and is aware of a dearth of fifth-century archaeology in and around Chichester, although he claims that Birdham, earlier Bridenham, might derive from Britwend + ham. during this period. Furthermore, only two early Anglo-Saxon objects have been found west of the River Arun and they can be firmly dated to the sixth century, rather later than √Ülle's time. One of those objects was a small long brooch from the Roman cemetery, in the St. Pancras area of Chichester.Welch. Early Anglo-Saxons in Brandon's The South Saxons. p. 27 - description of brooch and picture on p.151 (Plate 1.1) Its isolation suggests that it belonged to a Saxon woman who lived and died in a British community rather than in a Saxon settlement. No written Anglo-Saxon sources claim that Cissa was ever king. The 8th-century chronicler Bede stated that √Ülle was the first king to have held imperium, or overlordship, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, but he makes no mention of √Ülle's sons.Bede, Ecclesiastical History, II 5. The earliest source that does state that Cissa was king is that of the Anglo- Norman chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote between 1130 and 1154, and clearly used his imagination to fill out gaps in the historical record.Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon: Historia Anglorum. Sources section p.lxxxvi. Henry was one of the 'weaver' compilers of whom Bernard Guen√©e has written. Taking a phrase from here and a phrase from there, connecting an event here with one there, he wove together a continuous narrative which, derivative though it mostly is, is still very much his own creation,... Henry of Huntingdon derived a lot of his information from Bede. The 13th-century chronicler Roger of Wendover used Henry's work as his main source and it is probable that both Henry and Roger had access to information from manuscripts and oral sources now lost.Morris. (1973.)The Age of Arthur p.94 - Morris cross references British sources and Anglo-Saxon Archaeology as well as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to produce his conclusions.Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon: Historia Anglorum Chapter. II - Analysis of sources that survive and sources that are now lost.Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon: Historia Anglorum. Lost Sources p.ciii. Greenway suggests that Roger of Wendover took his account from Henry of Huntingdon and Matthew Paris took his from Roger of Wendover. The evidence for this is that Roger sometimes used Henry's words verbatim and sometimes paraphrased them. Both Henry of Huntingdon and Roger of Wendover provide extended versions of the three Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entries relating to √Ülle and his sons.Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon: Historia Anglorum. p.91 - And so Duke √Ülle with his sons and a fleet that was well equipped with fighting men, landed in Britain at Cymenes ore, When the Saxons disembarked, however, the Britons raised the alarm and a great number rushed from the surrounding districts and immediately gave battle. But the Saxons, who were much taller and stronger, received their disorganized attacks with disdain. For coming in small groups at intervals, they were slaughtered by the Saxons' cohesive force, and as each wave returned in shock, they heard the unexpectedly bad news. So the Britons were driven to the nearest forest, which is called Andresleigh.Wendover. Flowers of History, p.19.-..In the same year Duke √Ülle, the chief, and his three sons, Cymen, Plenting, and Cissa landed in Britain at a place that was after called from Cymen, Cymenshore, which means Cymen's Port. On their landing, then Britains assembled in great numbers and attacked them, but were driven from the field, and obliged to shelter in a neighbouring wood, called Andreswode. It is assumed by both authors that √Ülle was succeeded by his \\"son\\" Cissa - as is the alleged date of this \\"succession\\".Welch. Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex in Brandon's South Saxons. pp. 27-28Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon: Historia Anglorum. p.97. Footnote57.No genealogy of the South Saxon royal house survives and none seem to have been available to Henry. The death of Aella and the succession of Cissa are probably deduced from ASC 477 and 491.. Roger of Wendover even went so far as to provide a death date for Cissa, that had previously been absent. The date he gave was 590, which, given that Cissa is supposed to have arrived in Britain in 477, means that he must have been at least 123 years old when he died. An emendation from \\"died in 590\\", to \\"died aged 90\\" would resolve this inconsistency. As Kirby & Williams observed, \\"[i]t seems very unlikely that these annals in later medieval chronicles will provide a certain basis for historical reconstruction\\". Kirkby-Williams (1976). Review of The Age of Arthur. pp. 454‚Äì486. Evidence from place names A mention of Cissa, the √Ülle's son, in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle The early part of the Anglo Saxon Chronicle contains the frequent use of eponyms. The chronicle's entry for 477 names √Ülle's sons as Cymen, Wlenking, and Cissa. All three of √Ülle's 'sons' have names \\"which conveniently link to ancient or surviving place-names\\". Cymenshore, the landing place where the invasion started, is named after Cymen, Lancing after Wlenking and Chichester after Cissa. Conceivably the names of √Ülle's sons were derived from the place-names as the legends of the origins of the South Saxons evolved; or perhaps the legends themselves gave rise to the place-names.Dumville/ Keynes. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle. pp. 58-59. (In the Parker MS the annal number has been changed to 895 in another hand). Referring to a Danish raiding party that on its way homeward: \\"hamweard wende √æe Exanceaster beseten h√¶fde, √æa hergodon hie up on Su√∞seaxum neah Cisseceastre\\"-\\" homeward that had beset Exeter, they went up plundering in Sussex nigh Chichester\\".KEPN.'Cissa's Roman town'. Chichester was Noviomagus Reg(i)norum, capital of Civitas Reg(i)norum. According to the ASC, in 477, Cisse, son of Aelle, led an invasion of Sussex. There seems to be some confusion over whether personal name was derived from the place-name or vice versa. Another place name potentially associated with Cissa (pronounced 'Chissa') is the Iron Age hill fort Cissbury Ring, near Cissbury, which William Camden said \\"plainly bespeaks it the work of king Cissa\\".Camden. Britannia. p.312 - But Cisburie the name of the place doth plainely shew and testifie that it was the worke of Cissa: who beeing of the Saxons line the second king of this pety kingdom, after his father √Ülle, accompanied with his brother Cimen and no small power of the Saxons, at this shore arrived and landed at Cimenshore, a place so called of the said Cimen, which now hath lost the name; but that it was neere unto Wittering.. The association of Cissbury with Cissa is a 16th-century antiquarian invention. Records show that Cissbury was known as Sissabury in 1610, Cesars Bury in 1663, Cissibury in 1732 and Sizebury in 1744. A local tradition suggests that the camp was built and named after C√¶sar. Coates. Studies and Observations on Sussex Place-Names in SAC Vol.118 pp. 309‚Äì329 It is thought possible that Cissbury was used in the late Anglo-Saxon period, during the reigns of Ethelred II and Cnut as a mint. Old Iron Age forts were used as mints, during dangerous times, such as when there were frequent Viking raids. However, there has been no archaeological confirmation of Cissbury being occupied by Anglo- Saxons.Hill.

Like most Reformed Churches, the Church of Scotland has a presbyterian structure which invests in a hierarchy of courts, the authority which other denominations give to bishops. Nevertheless, the Church of Scotland does have the concept of a bishop, and there has been debate about widening this concept. Historical background The word bishop is derived from Greek episcopos, meaning \\"overseer\\". The word is used in the New Testament, but it is not certain what exactly the function of this office entailed in the Early Church. By the third century, however, both the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) Church had a system of bishops as spiritual rulers. After the Reformation, the Lutheran and Anglican traditions retained the episcopal system. The churches of the radical reformation, however, mostly rejected bishops, believing this concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals to be one of the causes of what they perceived as the corruption of the pre-Reformation Church. During the Scottish Reformation, the reformer John Knox initially wanted bishops in the Church of Scotland, but the transparency of the Presbyterian system, where all decisions are made in public meetings, was ultimately preferred. During parts of the 17th century there were conflicts between the Presbyterian and Episcopalian tendencies in the Kirk (see Bishops' Wars), with Episcopalianism (patronised by the monarch) sometimes in the ascendancy. Presbyterianians finally gained the upper hand, leading to the establishment of a separate Episcopal Church of Scotland in 1690. For a list of the 17th-century Church of Scotland bishops, see Bishop of Edinburgh, Archbishop of Glasgow and Bishop of Aberdeen. Use of the term \\"bishop\\" in the Church of Scotland today Although the Church of Scotland had no bishops after 1690, the term \\"bishop\\" is Biblical and it is not surprising that a Presbyterian Church, with its focus on the Bible, should retain the word in its basic sense of \\"one who has oversight\\". Specifically, a minister who is placed in charge of a person training for the ministry is referred to as the student's bishop. This term is used in the context of theology students doing \\"student attachments\\" (work-experience placements) in parishes and later of graduates who must complete a probationary year in a parish prior to ordination. Most lay people in the Church of Scotland, however, would be unaware of this usage. Proposals to reintroduce episcopacy In the latter part of the 20th century, there were a number of moves to reopen the debate on episcopacy. Presbyteries may be more transparent than bishops in their wielding of power, but they have often proved rather less good at the pastoral care of parish ministers, a problem with which the Church has frequently wrestled. One proposed solution, under the catchphrase \\"incorporating episcopacy into our system\\", was for presbyteries to appoint full-time or part-time bishops to minister to the ministers on the presbyteries' behalf. These bishops would not have the power of bishops in other traditions, but would have analogous pastoral functions. Precedents for such a \\"mixed system\\" were to be found in the Uniting Church in Australia and elsewhere. The most serious presentation of such proposals came in the 1980s when a union between the Church of Scotland and the Scottish Episcopal Church was attempted. A precondition from the Episcopalian side was that the united church should have a form of episcopacy recognisable to their tradition. Negotiations for the proposed union were almost completed, and were ratified by the General Assembly, but were voted down by the Church of Scotland's presbyteries when referred to them under the Barrier Act. In the 1990s, the Scottish Churches Initiative for Union (SCIFU) aimed to unite the Church of Scotland, Scottish Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church (in Scotland) and the United Reformed Church (in Scotland) by 2010. An element of the proposed structure was again a form of episcopal oversight, whilst retaining elders from the Presbyterian system. After considerable debate, the SCIFU proposals were rejected by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 2003.

She is associated with lyric soprano roles in operas by Mozart and Richard Strauss as well as lieder performances. Early life Bonney was born in Montclair, New Jersey. As a child she practiced piano and cello. When Bonney was 13 her family moved to Maine, where she became part of the Portland Symphony Youth Orchestra as a cellist. She spent two years at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) studying German and music including voice with Patricia Stedry, and spent her junior year at the University of Salzburg, where she switched from cello to voice. While there, she studied at the Salzburg Mozarteum. Years later she received an honorary doctorate from UNH. Career In 1979, Bonney joined the Staatstheater Darmstadt, where she made her debut as Anna in The Merry Wives of Windsor. In the subsequent five years she made appearances in Germany and throughout Europe, notably at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London and La Scala in Milan. She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1987 in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos in the role of Naiad and her Vienna State Opera debut the same year as Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier. Since then, she has appeared at the major opera houses of the world and at the Salzburg Festival, where she was Servilia in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito. Along with her repertoire in opera as a lyric soprano, she is a distinguished recitalist, and has appeared on more than 90 recordings, including 15 solo recitals. For two years, starting in 1999, Bonney did not perform in opera, to focus on lieder recitals. However, she noted that solo recitals lacked the camaraderie of performing in an opera production with many other people. In 2002, she contributed \\"The Willow Song\\" to the compilation album, When Love Speaks (EMI Classics), which features famous actors and musicians interpreting Shakespeare's sonnets and play excerpts. Other albums include her 2006 work on Welcome to the Voice, composed by Steve Nieve. On August 1, 2006, IMG Artists announced that all forthcoming appearances by Bonney were cancelled and that they would no longer be representing her. At the time, the IMG Artists website only stated the reason as \\"due to personal circumstances\\", but Bonney has stated in a July 2007 article that those circumstances included her \\"difficult\\" divorce from Maurice Whitaker.

The goal of TM is to combine disciplines, resources, expertise, and techniques within these pillars to promote enhancements in prevention, diagnosis, and therapies. Accordingly, translational medicine is a highly interdisciplinary field, the primary goal of which is to coalesce assets of various natures within the individual pillars in order to improve the global healthcare system significantly.  History  Translational medicine is a rapidly growing discipline in biomedical research and aims to expedite the discovery of new diagnostic tools and treatments by using a multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, \\"bench-to- bedside\\" approach. Within public health, translational medicine is focused on ensuring that proven strategies for disease treatment and prevention are actually implemented within the community. One prevalent description of translational medicine, first introduced by the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Research Roundtable, highlights two roadblocks (i.e., distinct areas in need of improvement): the first translational block (T1) prevents basic research findings from being tested in a clinical setting; the second translational block (T2) prevents proven interventions from becoming standard practice. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has made a major push to fund translational medicine, especially within biomedical research, with a focus on cross-functional collaborations (e.g., between researchers and clinicians); leveraging new technology and data analysis tools; and increasing the speed at which new treatments reach patients. In December 2011, The National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) was established within the NIH to \\"transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster.\\" The Clinical and Translational Science Awards, established in 2006 and now funded by NCATS, supports 60 centers across the country that provide \\"academic homes for translational sciences and supporting research resources needed by local and national research communities.\\" According to an article published in 2007 in Science Career Magazine, in 2007 to 2013 the European Commission targeted a majority of its ‚Ç¨6 billion budget for health research to further translational medicine.  Training and education  In recent years, a number of educational programs have emerged to provide professional training in the skills necessary for successfully translating research into improved clinical outcomes. These programs go by various names (including Master of Translational Medicine and Master of Science in Bioinnovation). Many such programs emerge from bioengineering departments, often in collaboration with clinical departments. = Master and PhD programmes = The University of Edinburgh has been running an MSc in Translational Medicine program since 2007. It is a 3-year online distance learning programme aimed at the working health professional. Aalborg University Denmark has been running a master's degree in translational medicine since 2009. A master's degree programme in translational medicine was started at the University of Helsinki in 2010. In 2010, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco used a founding grant from Andy Grovehttp://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/grove-backs-an-engineers- approach-to-medicine/?ref=technology Grove backs an engineer's approach to medicine\\"; New York Times blog to launch a joint program that became the Master of Translational Medicine. The program links the Bioengineering department at Berkeley with the Bioengineering and Therapeutic Science department at UCSF to give students a one-year experience in fostering medical innovation. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California was accredited in 2012 for a doctoral program in Biomedical Science and Translational Medicine.

Critics compare their sound to the band's own heroes, mainly early 1980s post-punk. The band is most often noted for its loud/soft musical dynamic and Aaron Perrino's soaring vocals, screaming in key one moment and howling a falsetto the next. The band has a large die hard fan base in what is often called \\"the three Bs\\": Boston, Buffalo, and Belgium. The band most often explains that they take the name from the Australian term \\"sheila\\", which denotes an effeminate man or wimp ‚Äì thus making them in a literal sense, the sacred wimps. However, there is also, in fact, a real live woman named Sheila Devine who Aaron, Jim, and Shawn were friends with at Oneonta State University.  Overview  The Sheila Divine formed in 1997 and played their first show on July 4 at The Middle East in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lineup consisted of singer, songwriter, and guitarist Aaron Perrino, bassist Jim Gilbert, and drummer Shawn Sears. All three had met in college at State University of New York at Oneonta, but each had ended up in Boston independently. They were signed to local indie label CherryDisc Records and released their self-titled five track EP in 1998. They gained a loyal local following and went on to win the 1999 WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble. CherryDisc Records were bought out by Roadrunner Records, who released The Sheila Divine's first full-length album New Parade in 1999. It received critical praise from local press and spawned the college radio hit Hum. The album featured re-recorded versions of songs that appeared on their first EP, as well as several brand new songs (the Japanese import edition featured two additional songs unavailable on the domestic release, \\"Secret Rendezvous\\" and \\"Weightless\\", the latter of which had also been released as the b-side to the then-titled \\"Criminal\\", the band's only released vinyl 7-inch). In late 2000, the band was hard at work on their second album when they added Colin Decker as a second guitarist to broaden their sound. The band released their second album, Where Have My Countrymen Gone, in March 2001 on Co-Op Pop Records. Later that year in August, Shawn Sears left the band to spend more time with his recently born child. Following a handful of shows with fill-ins Pete Caldes (The Gravel Pit/The Gentlemen) and Paul Buckley (Orbit), drummer Ryan Dolan replaced Sears a month later; Dolan had previously been in the band Lincolnville with guitarist Colin Decker. The Sheila Divine continued to tour constantly and created a large fan base that included both people who would see them across the country and others who would record live shows to share. The band was always generous to bootleggers and allowed video and/or audio taping at all shows. The band released the six track EP Secret Society in September 2002 (Arena Rock Recording Co.). They embarked on a non-stop world tour consisting of China, Europe, and then across the United States and back. This rigorous schedule would prove to be the band's undoing. While at a show in Milwaukee a confrontation with Jim resulted in Aaron throwing his guitar down and announcing to the audience that the band was breaking up. Upon returning home, the band stated on their website they would not break up, but would instead take time off. Aaron Perrino went on to start recording songs in the studio by himself, which would end up on the War Chords EP, the debut release of his new solo project, Dear Leader. The Sheila Divine officially announced their demise on their website in April 2003, and played two farewell shows in October at The Paradise in Boston, Massachusetts. The sold-out shows were attended by fans who had travelled from as far away as Belgium. The 2nd show was subsequently released as a DVD in 2007 entitled Funeral. On December 31, 2005 The Sheila Divine played a reunion show at Bill's Bar on Landsdowne Street in Boston. The band played as a three piece with Aaron, Jim, and Ryan. A second reunion show was played on Saint Patrick's Day March 17, 2007 at T.T. the Bear's Place with the same lineup. Subsequent reunion shows with the original line-up of Aaron, Jim, and Shawn took place on December 27, 2007 at TT the Bear's Place in Cambridge, MA, and the following two nights (both sold out shows) at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, MA. They played another short reunion show in Antwerp, Belgium at Humo's Pop Poll Deluxe at the Sportpaleis on March 3, 2008. On September 4, 2010 they played at Crammerock (Stekene, Belgium) another reunion show, with special guest Stijn Meuris who sang along on 'Automatic Buffalo'. The Sheila Divine performed a show on January 14, 2011, at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, MA with Orbit (band). They also played at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, MA on February 4, 2012, with Hurricane Bells and The Field Effect.  Reunion  Beginning in October 2010, The Sheila Divine regrouped and recorded a new album titled The Things That Once Were. The studio recordings were broadcast to the world via UStream, allowing an interactive experience between the band, studio crew and fans.

The history of banda music in Mexico dates from the middle of the 19th century with the arrival of piston metal instruments, when the communities tried to imitate the military bands. The first bandas were formed in Southern and Central Mexico. In each village of the different territories, there are certain types of brass bands, whether traditional, private, or municipal. Traditional ensembles Banda Reflejo Sinaloense There are brass instruments in the state of Oaxaca that date back to the 1850s. The repertoire of the bands of Morelos, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Michoac√°n covered gustos, sones, vinuetes, funeral pieces, marches, danzones, valses, corridos, paso dobles, polkas, rancheras, alabanzas, and foxes. The traditional bands that play Yucatecan jaran use the following instruments: clarinet, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, trumpet, trombone, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, g√ºiro. The traditional Oaxacan bands use a mix of saxophones and clarinets, fewer trumpets and slide trombones, and the bass drum and cymbals are played separately. One of the oldest bands recorded in Pizza is the Banda de Tlayacapan of the state of Morelos that was founded approximately in 1870, being one of the first to play la danza del Chinelo. The traditional Zacatecan tamborazo band does not use tuba, being the tambora the instrument that takes the low tone. Repertoire Brass bandas play a wide variety of song styles and instrumentals including rancheras, corridos, cumbias, charangas, ballads, boleros, salsas, bachatas, sones, chilenas, jarabes, mambos, danzones, tangos, sambas, bossa novas, pasodobles, marches, polkas, waltzes, mazurkas, chot√≠s, and swing. Perhaps the most popular song played by bandas is \\"El Sinaloense\\" (\\"The Sinaloan\\"), written by Severiano Brise√±o in 1944. \\"El Sinaloense\\" has been recorded by hundreds of bandas, in both lyrical and instrumental versions. The song has become so popular that many Sinaloans consider it as their unofficial anthem. History Banda in Sinaloa at the start of 1900. The history of banda music in Mexico dates from the middle of the 19th century with the arrival of piston metal instruments, when the communities tried to imitate the military bands. In each village of the different territories there are certain types of wind bands, whether traditional, private or municipal. Banda music was established in the 1880s in the Mexican state of Sinaloa and expanded to other nearby states in the 1890s. Its roots come from the overlapping of Mexican music with German polka music. At the time, many German Mexicans lived in the states of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Jalisco and Nuevo Le√≥n. This greatly influenced northern Mexican music. Immigrants from northern Mexico brought the music to the United States. Initially popular in the southwest United States, primarily in Texas, California and Arizona, banda has followed the movement of Mexican immigrants to the Midwest United States and the rest of the country. Mexicans who came in contact with Latin-based Jazz of Chicanos or Mexicans born and raised in the United States adopted jazz-like sounds in banda to further enrich the music type. Despite some having provided the music for solo vocalists such as Jos√© Alfredo Jim√©nez and Antonio Aguilar in years past, when it came time to record their own music, brass bandas almost exclusively performed instrumentals. In 1989, Banda El Recodo was the first brass banda to record songs with its own official vocalist, inspiring most bandas to follow suit. Famous banda soloists include Julio Preciado, Lupillo Rivera, Valent√≠n Elizalde, Pepe Aguilar, Joan Sebastian, Jos√© Manuel Figueroa, Pancho Barraza, El Chapo de Sinaloa, El Coyote, El Potro de Sinaloa, Ad√°n S√°nchez, Sergio Vega, Espinoza Paz, Roberto Tapia, Juli√≥n √Ålvarez, Larry Hern√°ndez, Gerardo Ort√≠z, Regulo Caro, Luis Coronel, El Dasa, Leonardo Aguilar, Remmy Valenzuela and Alfredo Olivas. Chalino S√°nchez and Juan Gabriel also contributed to banda music. Throughout the 20th century, brass banda music's mainstream popularity was traditionally confined to the state of Sinaloa. However, starting in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, it gained ground in the rest of Mexico‚Äôs pacific states, as well as a number of central states. By the new millennium, however, brass banda started to become popular throughout the rest of Mexico, eventually becoming the most popular Regional Mexican subgenre in the 21st century. La Arrolladora Juli√≥n √Ålvarez, a famous Banda singer. Despite banda being a male- dominated genre, there are a number of female soloist banda-singers such as Graciela Beltran, Diana Reyes, Beatriz Adriana and Yolanda P√©rez. Jenni Rivera, the highest earning solo banda singer of all-time has been attributed to bringing a female perspective to what had historically been a male- dominated genre. While not known primarily as banda singers, Ana B√°rbara and Ninel Conde have also recorded in the genre. Jenni Rivera, known as La Diva de la Banda (The Banda Diva). The highest-earning banda singer of all time. The 2010s wave of popularity of the tuba in Southern California has been credited to its presence in banda music. As of 2017, El Salvador started having its own Banda music. Traditional Brass Banda Sound A standard Sinaloa-style banda is made up of brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. The most notable instrument is the tambora which is a type of bass drum with a head made from animal hide, with a cymbal on top. Bandas were previously called \\"tamboras\\", named after this drum. The tambora is played in a strong and embellished manner, which provides the drive for the rest of the band. The percussion section also includes the tarola which is a snare with timbales which would resemble the tom-toms on a regular drumset, cowbells, and cymbals. Banda El Recodo, one of the most famous bandas, features three trumpets, four clarinets, three valve trombones or slide trombones, two E alto horns, and one sousaphone. Like an orchestra, a banda can be organized into different sections. * Bass: The lowest-pitched part is played by the sousaphone (referred to as a \\"tuba\\" in Mexico). * Percussion: Tambora (a large bass drum) with a cymbal on top. * Harmony: Two Armonias, \\"charchetas\\" or \\"saxores\\" in Mexico (E alto horns), play using different rhythms, depending on the style. * Tenor: valve trombones or slide trombones play in the lower register. * Alto: Trumpets plays in the upper register. * Soprano: Clarinets and sometimes saxophones play as \\"singing\\" instruments that may double the voice. * Vocals: Banda El Recodo has two vocalists, while Banda Jerez has one. However, some bandas consist of as many as three vocalists. Banda El Recodo Most banda arrangements feature three-part harmony and melodic sections which contrast the timbres of the clarinet, trumpet, and valve trombone sections. Historically, bandas were village brass bands called on to entertain the town, and would play anything from opera overtures to big band jazz. This tradition continues today in many towns, especially during festivals and celebrations. Bandas usually have a strong percussion. The percussionists generally provide the accents and do not usually play all the time or keep a 'groove'. Often the percussionists will enter only when the singer is not singing, such as in an instrumental chorus. The groove is mostly provided by the sousaphone (or bass guitar in a few recordings) playing the bass line, and the alto horns playing sharp upbeats. Typically when a banda plays a cumbia, the alto horn players switch to Latin percussion instruments such as timbales, maracas, cowbell, congas, bongos and guiro. Bandas generally contain between 10 and 20 members. They usually have a lead singer and a second voice, and occasionally a third voice. The voice often consists of a duet, but solo singers and trios are also common. Besides the typical instrumentation, banda music, as well as many other forms of Regional Mexican music, is also noted for the grito mexicano, a yell that is done at musical interludes within a song, either by the musicians and/or the listening audience. Similar genresTechnobanda= In the early 1980s, a new style of Regional Mexican music was developed in the state of Nayarit called Technobanda. Pioneered by bands such as Banda Machos, Banda Maguey and Banda Ark√°ngel R-15 it is essentially a hybrid of traditional Banda with Grupero music. Its popularity spread to many nearby states as well as the United States in the 1990s. In this subgenre, some or all of the horns are replaced by electric instruments. A typical Technobanda will substitute a sousaphone with an electric bass and the alto horns with an electronic keyboard and an electric guitar. The clarinets are frequently replaced with saxophones, while a drum set replaces the snare drums. The genre popularized the dance style, Quebradita. Technobandas had already established vocalists within their repertoire before brass bandas officially added their own vocalists. =Tierra Caliente= In the early 1990s, another style of Regional Mexican music was developed in the state of Michoacan called Tierra Caliente. Like Technobanda, it includes vocals, electric instruments like a bass guitar and electronic keyboard, as well as brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, saxophones and drums. Some bands also use accordions. Tierra Caliente's popularity was originally limited to the regions of Mexico it is named after, but it went on to gain popularity throughout many parts of the country, as well as in the United States. =Duranguense= Duranguense was also created in the early 1990s. It first became prominent in Chicago, Illinois and surged to large-scale popularity during the mid-2000s among the Mexican and Mexican-American community at large in the United States, as well as in Mexico. The instrumental line-up includes vocals, saxophones, trombones, keyboards, drums and a tambora. This genre popularized the dance style, Pasito Durangense. The main differences between Technobanda, Tierra Caliente and Duranguense is that the synthesizer riffs are different for all three styles of music, and the fact that Duranguense includes a tambora, while the others do not. Also, Technobanda may include an electric guitar, while the other two traditionally do not, and each subgenre has between one and three vocalists per band. The three subgenres simultaneously produce rancheras, corridos, cumbias, charangas, ballads, boleros, sones, chilenas, polkas and waltzes. =Tamborazo= Tamborazo is closely related to traditional brass Banda. However, Tamborazo uses saxophones instead of clarinets. Another difference from banda is that Tamborazo uses its drum consistently, as opposed to banda which distributes the use of the other instruments throughout a song. Tamborazo originated in Villanueva in the state of Zacatecas. Tamborazo uses various instruments such as: * Tambora * Saxophone * Trumpet * Snare drum * Trombone * Tenor horn * Sousaphone Tamborazo bands tend to focus more on instrumental sones, polkas, waltzes, marches, cumbias and mambos.

Born in Fairfield, South Carolina, his family moved to the Republic of Texas in 1838. At the beginning of the Civil War, Jones enlisted and served in the Eighth Texas Cavalry regiment (better known as \\"Terry's Texas Rangers\\") under the command of Benjamin Franklin Terry. He was later promoted to the rank of major. After the war, he moved briefly to Mexico with the purpose of locating and founding an exile colony for former Confederate supporters, but he returned to Texas after the attempt failed. In 1874, and after a short incursion in politics, he accepted the offer of commanding a newly formed branch of the Texas Rangers, named the \\"Frontier Battalion.\\" This force had the special task of stopping the numerous Indian raids and enforcing the law within the territory of the State. In the following years, Jones engaged in battle with the Comanche, the Kiowa and the Apache on several occasions, and the Frontier Battalion under his command was instrumental in ending the Indian incursions and raids over the settlers' homesteads. His force also played a major role in pursuing and capturing many criminals and outlaws, such as noted bank robber Sam Bass in 1878. Jones was an active Mason, and in 1879 he achieved the position of Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Austin.

He played with the San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Florida Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal Expos in the National League, and the Oakland A's and Texas Rangers in the American League. He is currently the pitching coach for the Tucson Toros. He is one of only three players (Jason Varitek and Michael Conforto are the others) to play in the Little League World Series, the College World Series, and the Major League World Series, and is the only pitcher to have done so. He played first base for Tucson, Arizona in the 1973 Little League World Series final. He pitched a one-hitter in the semifinals against Birmingham, Michigan. He played for the 1980 NCAA champion University of Arizona. He then played for the Florida Marlins in the 1997 Major League World Series. Career Edward John Vosberg was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 3rd round of the 1983 MLB draft. He began his professional career with the single A Reno Padres in the California League. Whilst with Reno he showed promise going 6-6 and sporting a 3.87 earned run average. After only 15 games with the single A Reno Padres he was called up to the AA Beaumount Golden Gators. His brief stint there in 1983 yielded one game where he went 7.0 shutout innings only giving up 2 hits with 2 walks and 1 strikeout. Vosberg stayed in AA with the Golden Gators for the 1984 season improving to a 13‚Äì11 record with an earned run average of 3.43 and 100 strikeouts.

Said to be the largest pig ever bred in Britain.Gloucester Old Spot by John Miles. BBC 2011. Retrieved 15 September 2011. The Gloucestershire Old Spots (also \\"Gloucester, Gloucester Old Spot, Gloucestershire Old Spot\\"Breeds of Livestock ‚Äî Gloucestershire Old Spots Swine or simply \\"Old Spots\\"Oldspots.com) is an English breed of pig which is predominantly white with black spots. It is named after the county of Gloucestershire. The Gloucestershire Old Spots pig is known for its docility, intelligence, and prolificity. Boars reach a mature weight of 600 lb (272 kg) and sows 500 lb (227 kg). The pigs are white with clearly defined black (not blue) spots. There must be at least one spot on the body to be accepted in the registry. The breed's maternal skills enable it to raise large litters of piglets on pasture. Its disposition and self‚Äësufficiency should make it attractive for farmers raising pasture pigs and those who want to add pigs to diversified operations. History The Gloucestershire Old Spots (GOS) Breed Society was formed in 1913. The originators of that society called the breed 'Old' Spots because the pig had been known for as long as anyone could remember. The first pedigree records of pigs began in 1885, much later than it did for cattle, sheep and horses because the pig was a peasant's animal, a scavenger and was never highly regarded. No other pedigree spotted breed was recorded before 1913, so today's GOS is recognised as the oldest such breed in the world. From the British Pig Association: \\"Although if old paintings are to be trusted, there have been spotted pigs around for two or three centuries, the Gloucestershire Old Spots has only had pedigree status since the early 20th century.\\" =Origins and development= Besides its correct title and variations such as Gloster Spot or just Old Spot, the breed is also known as the \\"Orchard Pig\\"RBST Watchlist and \\"The Cottager's Pig\\". Despite these humble origins, both The Prince of Wales and The Princess Royal keep GOS pigs on their respective Gloucestershire estates. One other notable contributor is the Lincolnshire Curly Coat, a pig that has since gone extinct. The Old Spots is also genetically and characteristically similar to the extinct Cumberland pig and is being used in its attempted recreation in the UK. These breeds were regarded as thrifty and excellent foragers, supplementing their feed with roots and vegetation. Additionally, the GOS gene pool has contributed to the American Spot and the Chester White. Additional commonalities among these breeds include excellent maternal instincts and even temperament, as Old Spots tend to be very calm, good-natured animals, another trait that makes them desirable to homesteaders and small farmers. The females tend to be very devoted mothers, while the males seldom pose a threat to piglets. Kangal dog. The Old Spots was once a very popular breed of pig. With the advent of intensive farming, certain lean, pale, high-yield breeds were chosen to suit the factory conditions and needs of mass-production. Many old breeds of pig died out, or were greatly diminished, in this time. However, owing to consumer pressure in the United Kingdom, and changes to the law, both attributable to an increasing awareness of, and concern about, farming conditions, pigs have been increasingly reared outdoors there. In addition, more consumers are looking for quality meat, as opposed to cheap, bland meat product. In these conditions, old breeds well-suited to living outdoors, such as the Old Spots, have increasingly been chosen by farmers looking to add value to their products. Endangered breed GOS is on the \\"Critical\\" List by The Livestock Conservancy,The Livestock Conservancy ‚Äî Conservation Priority List meaning there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and estimated fewer than 2000 global population. In the UK the Old Spots is listed as \\"Category 5, Minority\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust as there are fewer than 1000 registered breeding females.Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list accessed 21 May 2008 An application has been made to gain European Commission Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) status for Old Spots pig meat.Written Answer given in the House of Lords, 15 March 2006: Column WA236 accessed at Parliament.uk 25 July 2006 This was granted on 29 July 2010. The TSG certification attests that a particular food product objectively possesses specific characteristics which differentiate it from all others in its category, and that its raw materials, composition or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. Breed characteristics The GOS is a large breed, white in colour with a minimum of one distinct black spot. It has lop ears which will almost cover the face of a mature pig and hang towards the nose. A good example of an adult GOS sow GOS sow Standards: * Head: Long length with a slightly dished nose.

Distribution  Andes mountains of central and south Bolivia and northwest Argentina at elevations of 1600 ‚Äì 3600 m.  Description  Weingartia lanata in flower. Plants usually solitary. Stems globose to oblong, to 20 cm high and 15 cm, rarely 30 cm in diameter, fresh green. Ribs 12 - 18, spiraling, forming distinct tubercles. Areoles on the tubercle in excentric position, sunken in its higher part. Spines more robust and thick, 7 ‚Äì 35 in one areole, radial spines 1 ‚Äì 3 cm long, central spines 3 - 4, to 5 cm long. Flowers borne near the stem tips, one areole can produce up to 3 flowers, golden yellow to orange to reddish yellow, 1 ‚Äì 3 cm in diameter. Floral tube scales broad and imbricated. Fruits globose to ovoid, brownish. Seeds oblong, 1 mm long, black or brown. Taxonomy The genus Weingartia was designated in 1937 by Werdermann to replace invalid genus Spegazzinia Backeberg 1933. All species of the genus Weingartia were transferred to synonymy status under the genus Rebutia (Hunt & Taylor, 1990; Hunt, 1999, Anderson 2001). More recent research has indicated that the genus Rebutia as currently defined is polyphyletic. Sulcorebutia and Weingartia were kept as separate genera in the study; a summary cladogram for those species studied is shown below. Species formerly classified as Weingartia, Sulcorebutia and Cintia Kn√≠≈æe & ≈ò√≠ha show a close relationship to each other. The larger group of species of Rebutia studied, those with hairy or bristly pericarpels, form a separate, more distantly related clade (Rebutia I). It is suggested that these be excluded from the genus Rebutia.  List of species  List of species accepted by The Plant List Org. :Weingartia fidaiana (Backeb.)

The church is in Buckingham Gate, on the corner of Castle Lane and opposite the junction with Petty France. Buckingham Gate is just off Victoria Street and near Buckingham Palace. The church has had several notable pastors including G. Campbell Morgan (1904‚Äì17, 1933‚Äì43), John Henry Jowett (1918‚Äì22), Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1939‚Äì68), R. T. Kendall (1977‚Äì2002) and Greg Haslam (2002‚Äì16). History The congregation was formed in 1840 and its original chapel building was completed in Buckingham Gate in 1841. The congregation outgrew that building, so construction of a new chapel was begun in 1864. This building is the present chapel. It opened on 6 July 1865 and has capacity to seat about 1,500 people. Westminster Chapel has had four particularly well- known pastors: the Revd Samuel Martin (1842‚Äì78), G. Campbell Morgan (1904‚Äì17 and 1933‚Äì43), D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1939‚Äì68) and R. T. Kendall (1977‚Äì2002). The chapel was founded as a Congregational church, but during the pastorate of D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1939‚Äì68) the church left the Congregational Union and joined the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches (founded 1967) and the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches. Prominent among the past deacons at Westminster Chapel have been Sir Fred Catherwood (1925‚Äì2014; son-in-law to Lloyd-Jones) and MJ \\"Monty\\" Micklewright (1897‚Äì1994). The reformed theologian John Murray also delivered a notable lecture here titled \\"The Heavenly, Priestly Activity of Christ\\" in 1958.Collected Writings of John Murray, Vol. 1. John Murray, Banner of Truth, (2015), pg.44 During R. T. Kendall's pastorate, he led the church to adopt many emphases and practices of the Charismatic movement, despite the concerns of other church officers that these were contrary to the church's accepted reformed teachings. The following pastor, Greg Haslam, was previously the pastor of Winchester Family Church, a Newfrontiers church, and continued this trend, introducing many of Newfrontiers' core values to the church. In addition to the activities of the Chapel's own worshipping community, the Chapel is well known as a host venue for many Christian conferences and assemblies including, in the past, as a venue for the \\"May Meetings\\" of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. ActivitiesSundays= The church is evangelical in its beliefs. Services include worship, opportunities for prophecies, and a biblical sermon. Westminster Chapel aims to be a prophetic voice to London, the UK and the nations. It recently issued a \\"Mission, Vision, Values\\" brochure, stating that the church would be Spirit-led, prophetic, and be increasingly mission-minded. The church aims to be a family and open to all who may want to visit. Sunday services are at 11 am. =Life Groups= Groups called Life Groups meet in homes throughout London, usually on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. These include special groups for students. The church's website states that these are \\"the hub of friendship, discipleship and evangelism\\" at the Chapel. =Alpha course= Westminster Chapel hosts a free Alpha course twice a year. Alpha is an opportunity to explore the meaning of life over dinner, and the Chapel's course usually runs on a Monday night. =Westminster Foodbank= Westminster Chapel currently runs the Westminster Foodbank, as part of the Trussell Trust network of food banks. =Student work= About 70 students and people in their twenties currently attend the Chapel, and the church has a dedicated team who minister to this age group. There are events specifically aimed at students and twenties, as well as those that cater to the wider church family with which students can join in. Twice a year the Chapel hosts a retreat for students and twenties. Pastors The tower on the corner of Buckingham Gate and Castle Lane In August 2016 the church announced that an eldership team would be appointed, and Howard Satterthwaite would be appointed as Lead Elder. The full list of previous pastors is: * 1842‚Äì78 Revd Samuel Martin (helped by Henry Simon for the last two years of his pastorate) * 1876‚Äì87 Revd Henry Simon * 1887‚Äì94 no settled ministry * 1894‚Äì95 Revd W.

It is built of stock brick with some red brick and stone dressings. The fa√ßade on Buckingham Gate is gabled and has a recessed triple-arched central porch, with graduated arcading above, all having decorative shafting. There is a tower to the right, with coupled arched windows. The top stage of the tower was added in the 20th century in a different style and colour. The auditorium, with seating capacity of about 1,500, is nearly oval, with two tiers of galleries and large open roof span. The galleries too are nearly oval, except that the 'circle' of the upper gallery is incomplete so as to accommodate the pipe organ. There is a high platform or da√Øs toward the front of the Chapel, accommodating the Communion Table and chairs for the presiding minister and the serving deacons. This platform or da√Øs is about three feet above the floor level. Beyond this is a large (and even higher) platform or da√Øs, forming a very large preaching- station or pulpit. This feature is circular and surmounted by a balustrade. It may perhaps be one of the largest pulpits in any church building. The chapel is a Grade II Listed building. Pipe organ A four-manual pipe organ was built by the eminent organ-builder Henry Willis (1821‚Äì1901; often known as \\"Father Willis\\") and restored and enlarged in the 1920s by Messrs Rushworth and Draper.

Previously, he had played with Saracens in England, and before that the in the Currie Cup and the in the Super 14 for many years. He also featured frequently in the Springbok squad before his departure for Europe. He won 23 caps and scored 40 points (8 tries) for his country. National team Russell was born in Port Elizabeth, but was schooled at Selborne College in East London. He was quickly brought up to international rugby level when he was selected for the 2002 Springboks team after making a good impression whilst in the national sevens team. In that year, he scored an especially memorable try in the Tri Nations against the Australian Wallabies in which he wriggled out of a seemingly sure tackle and successfully eluded several Wallabies on his way to the tryline. However, he has not been able to consistently break into the Boks lineup in recent years. He is a relatively small player, but what he lacks in size and strength he makes up in speed, acceleration, agility and creativity. He is considered to be one of the most dangerous backline players in South Africa for this very reason, as he has the ability to score a try \\"out of nothing\\". Club rugby Russell is a victim of his own versatility, with coaches unsure in which position to place him. Although a favourite with the fans and a player of outstanding talent, he made few starts for the Sharks during the 2005/06 season, forcing him to make a move to Western Province where it was said he would be given plenty of game time and would also see him play at fly-half for the Stormers in the Super 14 rather than the utility role he fulfilled at the Sharks.Western Province news report Russell signed for Saracens F.C. in time for their campaign in 2007.

Early life  Wilson was born in a log cabin in rural Texas, one of 16 children of a sharecropper. By the age of seven, Wilson was already an avid artist and by age twelve, he determined that he would be an illustrator. This ambition was supported by his family until they realized that he intended to make a living off of cartooning. Deemed by his father to be a \\"white man's profession\\", Wilson's dreams were put on hold until he received the support of a high school teacher, who bought him materials.  Career  Moving to San Antonio after graduation from high school, Wilson found it difficult to secure work due to segregation. This led to Wilson working as a sports cartoonist for the San Antonio Register for free for four years beginning in 1940. For him, the experience was as valuable as money. In 1946, he moved to Oakland, California where he worked for the California Quarter Mater Depot while freelancing for the Oakland Post Inquirer. He began working for the Los Angeles Sentinel in 1956, initially as a sports cartoonist. Of his role at the Sentinel, Wilson said, \\"The Sentinel must have hired me because they got tired of being pestered. I went back with cartoon after cartoon for ten years.\\" He became the paper's editorial cartoonist and worked in that position until his 2002 retirement. In 1990, he was inducted into the Black Press Hall of Fame at Howard University. While working at the Sentinel, Wilson also worked for a company that created hand- painted T-shirts and as a janitor for Security Pacific Bank to generate extra income. In a 1991 interview, Wilson states, \\"Now, here was segregation again...the only thing Blacks could do at that time was be a janitor, elevator operator, or parking attendant.\\" With segregation waning in the west, Wilson was able to apply for a job within the bank's corporate trust department, which he secured. He retired from that position in 1979. Wilson's cartoons were also published in Chicago based Nation of Islam periodical The Final Call, Rockford's Bible Force and the Los Angeles Times .  Legacy  Wilson was honored by the National Newspaper Publishers Association. His son Clint Cornelius Wilson, II became a journalist and educator and was chair of Howard University's journalism department.

Blast from the Past: Q&A; with Kirk Dressendorfer, December 16, 2004. Because Van Poppel was signed to a major league contract rather than the standard minor league contract, the A's only had a limited number of minor league options they could use on him. By all accounts, his lack of seasoning in the minors cost both the A's and Van Poppel. He pitched just 37.2 innings in Single-A in 1990, spent 1991 at Double-A Huntsville, and was hurt for much of 1992 at Triple-A Tacoma before splitting time between Oakland and Tacoma in 1993. In all, he made only 32 minor league starts.Todd Van Poppel, Cincinnati.com, 2004.Kevin T. Czerwinski. Mets sign veteran Van Poppel, Press Release, 2005. Armed with a blazing fastball that had little movement, Van Poppel struggled with the A's. His best season in Oakland was probably 1995, when he went 4‚Äì8 with a 4.88 ERA, splitting time as a starter and a reliever. He also notched 122 strikeouts (and 56 walks) in 138.1 innings that year. In 1996, his numbers dropped sharply, and he was released by the A's mid-season. After unremarkable stops in Detroit, Texas and Pittsburgh, Van Poppel did have two successful years (2000 and 2001) as a middle reliever with the Cubs, before his effectiveness declined. Van Poppel's career record was 40‚Äì52. He never won more than seven games in a season. Retirement Shortly after his retirement from baseball in 2005, Van Poppel announced he was investing in the Denton Outlaws, a Texas Collegiate League team. The Outlaws went on to win the league championship that year.Brett Vito. Baseball: Van Poppel to invest in Outlaws, GoMeanGreen.com, May 17, 2005.

Ewald is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Foster Care Support Foundation, Inc. The Foster Care Support Foundation FCSF is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that provides clothing, infant care equipment, and toys to an average of 4500 foster and displaced children throughout the state of Georgia annually. The services are free for those raised on basic state per-diem and for grandparents and relatives raising their grandchildren, nieces or nephews without the biological parent/s present in the home or in their children's lives. In 1996, Ms. Ewald began collecting and distributing clothing and toy donations from neighbors to give to local foster children in need. The program and need grew quickly and the Foundation was incorporated in 2000 and has provided for over 66,000 children since its incorporation. Ewald, a foster parent herself for fourteen years to over 50 children and mother of five, understood the difficulty for some to raise a child on the small per diem the state offered at that time. The center allows for more foster parents to afford to care for state children, while also allowing the children to acquire their own clothes, toys, and school supplies to be like any other child. This could be difficult after losing everything when pulled from their biological homes. The organization's donation/distribution center, located at 115 Mansell Place in Roswell GA is set up like a retail store and is fully stocked with clothing, toys, bikes, highchairs, school supplies and other necessities, where foster and relative care parents or grands raising grands throughout the state can access either by appointment or mail out for free. Rachel Ewald has also written a set of transition guidelines \\"Healthy Children, Healthy Adults\\" for foster care and adoption, with the intent of reducing disruption and trauma in foster and adoptive homes and when moving children to reunify them with their biological families or to an adoptive home. FCSF provides much needed support with clothing, toys, school supplies and infant items to Grandparents who are the sole caretakers of their grandchildren, the faster growing population of foster care in the country. The Foundation provides an event called 'Prom-A-Palooza' in February where teen girls in foster, relative, grandparent and group homes from all over the State of Georgia attend to select prom a dress, jewelry, shoes, accessories and make up with consultation and a photo opt so that they can be a part of their own high school proms with their friends without worry of the cost. This is a wonderful event that is always rewarding for all involved. Funded by private individual donations, corporate sponsors, foundation grants, and faith based organizations, FCSF receives no government or federal money for the program. FCSF is a private/public partnership with the State Division of Family and Children's Services. Funds and sponsors are always needed to operate the foundation as the Ms Ewald continues to reach out to thousands of children across the State needing FCSF's services every year. The Hope 4 Tomorrow mentoring program launched in 2016 carefully matches teens with professional and caring adults to help mentor and guide them through their middle and high school years as they prepare to age out into adult life.  Recognition  Rachel Ewald has been recognized by many groups and organizations throughout the United States for her efforts in changing the face of foster care in Georgia. Awards include: The 2003 Commissioners Award for the state of Georgia by Governor Sonny Perdue The 2003 daily Points of Light Foundation Award The 2002 DHR Beacon of Light Award The Casey Family Foundation's Ruth Massinga Award in January 2009 The CCAI's Angels in Adoption award in Sept of 2009 nominated by Congressman Tom Price The Building Community Award from the Home Depot Foundation in 2009 A proclamation from the Georgia House for the work done to help foster children in Georgia in 2011 The Womenetics award and in 2012 The Spirit Award from AIBTV in 2013.

HistoryHarmony Bandits and Sour= Gnecco in November 2014.Since their creation in 1990, the line-up has evolved many times, but Gnecco has always felt that having a rotating group of musicians who could play off each other was important. In high school, Gnecco was in the band Lost Child and later, The Harmony Bandits, which eventually evolved into what is now Ours. In 1994, Ours released their first album titled Sour under their own label entitled \\"Beatnik Records\\" owned by Mike Marri. Afterward, the band dissolved and did not reform again for several years. =Distorted Lullabies and Precious= In 1997, Gnecco restarted Ours again and quickly drew industry attention. Ours signed with DreamWorks Records and after four years, released their first major label album Distorted Lullabies in 2001. Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, the album received mixed reviews but led to successful tours with acts such as Ocean Colour Scene, Pete Yorn, and The Cult. The track \\"Sometimes\\" peaked at #31 on the US Billboard Modern Rock charts that year, while the music video saw moderate airtime on MTV. Ours performed in Toronto at the Opera House in October, 2001.\\"LIVE: Ours October 05, 2001\\".Chart Attack. Review by Erik Missio. The album Precious followed soon after in 2002; Precious featured a more stripped-down sound and received much more positive reviews and led to a slot opening for The Wallflowers. =Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy= In 2004, Ours relocated from New Jersey to Los Angeles to work with Rick Rubin. The resulting album, Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy was released on April 15, 2008. =The Heart= In 2010, Gnecco released his self-produced first solo acoustic effort, The Heart, and followed it in 2011 with the release of The Heart: X Edition, in which Gnecco built upon the intimacy of his solo album with a lush full band version of the record. =Ballet The Boxer 1= In 2012, Ours launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund the recording of their new album, Ballet The Boxer 1. The band managed to reach 136% of the goal for their crowdfunding, and subsequently finished the album recording in 2013. Following a few setbacks, the album was eventually released on May 4 for those who participated in the crowdfunding, and a public release followed on June 11. Ours and Gnecco have received worldwide acclaim from critics and fans for their live shows and for Gnecco's dynamic voice and songwriting style, and both have developed a cult-like following that continues to grow.

It has a population of about 3,000, measured in the 2011 Census as 3,040. History Kirkbymoorside is noted as Chirchebi in the Domesday Book of 1086. It has served as a trading hub at least since 1254, when it became a market town. There are two ancient coaching inns extant, the Black Swan with its carved porch, and the cruck-framed George and Dragon, which originated in the 13th century. The Georgian fa√ßades point to later periods of commercial prosperity on the coaching route between York and Scarborough.Town Council website: Retrieved 10 April 2011. Some Ancient British, Viking and Anglo- Saxon remains have been found in the vicinity. The Norman baron Robert de Stuteville built a wooden moated castle on Vivers Hill. The estate passed to the Wake family in the 13th century, who brought prosperity to the town. However, it was badly hit by the Black Death of the mid-14th century, after which the wooden castle lay in ruins. Prosperity returned after 1408, when the Neville family took over, although little remains of the fortified manor they built to the north of the town. The Nevilles remained Catholic and took part in the Rising of the North of 1569. By 1660 there was a grammar school. (The building is now part of the library.) The great Toll Booth in the middle of the town was built about 1730 with stone taken from the Nevilles' manor. The old Market Hall was gutted by fire but rebuilt in 1872. By 1881 the population of the town was 2,337.Town Council website: Retrieved 10 April 2011. There is some dispute as to the correct spelling (the alternative spelling being Kirbymoorside (which is how the railway companies spelt the name on the station), as it is traditionally pronounced), but it is usually and officially spelled with the \\"k\\". Signposts also read \\"Kirkbymoorside\\". \\"Kirk\\" means church and \\"-by\\" is the Viking word for settlement, so the name translates as \\"settlement with a church by the moorside\\", or, as Ekwall argues, Moorside is \\"Moresheved\\" which means \\"top of the moor\\". A valley near the town is known as Kirkdale. More recently, Kirkbymoorside was the last town in England to adopt double yellow lines to restrict parking. George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, died on 16 April 1687, in the house of a local tenant, from a chill caught whilst hunting nearby. England‚Äôs oldest fox hunt, still running today, is the Bilsdale Hunt in Yorkshire, which the Duke founded in 1668.Hunt site Retrieved 16 July 2017.

Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 3,444. Economy The town is home to one of the few remaining British producers of light aircraft, Slingsby Aviation. (The other is Britten-Norman on the Isle of Wight). Many sub-sea vehicles and robots are also manufactured at Slingsby Aviation, which is located roughly 1 mile south of the town centre. Culture and community The town is home to Kirkbymoorside Town Brass Band, which has achieved success on a national level, most recently winning the North of England Brass Band First Section Championship in 2004, 2008 and 2015. As a result of their 2008 success, the band competed in the National Finals in Harrogate on 28 September 2008 and claimed 3rd place overall. The anarchist poet and art critic Herbert Read was born in the hamlet of Muscoates,1901 census about four miles (6.4 km) south of Kirkbymoorside, and the area surrounding the town provided some of the inspiration for his only completed novel, The Green Child. The town hosts the Ryedale Show, an annual agricultural show. Transport Kirkbymoorside's former railway station Kirbymoorside [sic] railway station was connected to the national railway network from 1875 until 1964 as part of the Gilling and Pickering line. The track was lifted by August 1965. The last passenger trains ran in the early 1950s, but a goods train ran from Malton via Gilling East until 1964. The rails between Kirkbymoorside and Pickering were lifted in the 1950s and the main A170 road runs over part of the track bed to the east of the town. There were plans, since withdrawn, for a Tesco store to be built on the site of the old railway station, which caused some controversy. The station buildings were demolished in 2010 and the site is now occupied, in part, by new houses. Today the 128 bus route is run by Scarborough and District (part of the East Yorkshire bus company) from Helmsley to Scarborough and passes through the town via West End and Piercy End. The service operates at approximately hourly intervals on Mondays to Saturdays but actual times vary from hour to hour. In summer the service forms part of the Moorsbus network on Sundays and Public Holidays when it extends westwards beyond Helmsley to Sutton Bank. Connections to York are by the Stevensons of Easingwold company's 31X service via Helmsley. There is one direct bus to and from Kirkbymoorside on Monday to Saturday.Bus services in York Retrieved 9 March 2016. Transdev operates the 840 route from Pickering to York and Leeds via Malton, accessible by using the 128 from Kirkbymoorside. There are no connections at Pickering between the two bus routes. The 840 also calls at Kirby Misperton, the location of Flamingoland theme park and zoo, and at Malton bus and railway stations. Education Kirkbymoorside has only a primary school. The town is in the catchment area of the comprehensive secondary Ryedale School, which is located in Nawton, three miles (4.8 km) away, and has about 600 pupils. Kirkbymoorside hosts an annual 10 km road- running race on the Sunday prior to May Day Bank Holiday each year. The race was started in 2000 by Malcolm Hodgson, Dr Tim Hughes and Martin Lush to raise funds for local schools.

Born in Milan, Raimondi emigrated to Peru, arriving on July 28, 1850, at the port of Callao. In 1851 he became a professor of natural history. In 1856, he was one of the founding professors of the medical school at the National University of San Marcos; in 1861, he founded the analytical chemistry department. Raimondi died in the town of San Pedro de Lloc in the La Libertad Region of northern Per√∫. The house in which he died still stands and is located within a block of the town's main plaza. It has been converted to a museum in his honor. Throughout his career, Raimondi displayed a passion for all things Peruvian. He undertook no less than 18 extensive journeys to all regions of the country, studying the nation's geography, geology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and archaeology. In 1875, he collected his findings in the massive tome El Per√∫, which was subsequently republished in numerous editions over the next 40 years. The Raimondi Museum in Lima houses some of the collections he gathered in his travels. A popular historical figure in Peru, Raimondi is the namesake of many Peruvian cultural institutions, including schools, theaters, museums, and institutes of higher learning. The Antonio Raymondi Province (county) in the Ancash Region (state) of Peru is also named after him. Some of his biological discoveries also carry his name, such as the Neoraimondia genus of cactus.

Ullrich signed on to play Major League Baseball in the Washington Senators organization. He batted and threw right-handed during his baseball career. Career At the age of 22, Ullrich made his Major League debut on May 3, 1944, going two and third innings while giving up one earned run. Ullrich pitched nine and two-thirds innings that year, giving up ten earned runs for an earned run average of 9.31. The next year the Senators and Ullrich were better statistically than in the 1944 season. Ullrich at the time was just 23 years old, the second youngest regular on the Senators staff. Ullrich pitched 81 and one third innings for the second place Senators. This was in 28 games, six games started. In 1945 Ullrich tied for eighth with 15 games finished. Ullrich played his final Major League game on September 16 of 1945. At the time of his retirement Ullrich had a 3‚Äì3 record, a 5.04 ERA, 38 walks, and 28 strikeouts. Ullrich was 7 for 25 hitting, with a lifetime batting average of .280. His lifetime fielding percentage was 1.000. Background Ullrich's career took place during World War II. With many baseball stars leaving to serve the United States, it was questioned whether Major League Baseball would continue during this period. Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that it would, and therefore teams needed players to fill the spots of players that had left. Ullrich was one of the many that played Major League Baseball during this period. Unfortunately for Ullrich, when the war ended players returned to their teams. Like many others, Ullrich found himself out of the Major Leagues.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 386-7 is a Scottish indie musician, singer and songwriter. He was originally a member of post-punk band Josef K, active between 1979 and 1982. Josef K, 1979-1981 Haig was the lead vocalist of Josef K, an Edinburgh band, which recorded five singles 1979 and 1981 and an album (The Only Fun in Town) signed to the Postcard record label,Kellman, Andy \\"[ Paul Haig Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 16 October 2010 before splitting in August 1981; their final Scottish date was in Glasgow. The break-up was due to a combination of too-great expectations, too-small financial returns, Haig's dislike of touring, and disagreements over future direction. The following year Haig told Johnny Waller in Sounds: \\"I was pretty depressed for a week because it was the end of an era, but after that I was really happy that we'd split, because I could get on with everything I wanted to do. I've lost a lot of the ideals I had in Josef K. About not wanting to be commercially successful, suffering for your art and all that. I want to be signed to a major and make a great record that will get radio airplay and be a big hit, then make my own money from that. I don't mind being manipulated to a certain extent to get what I want, but in time I want to control everything.\\" Solo career, 1982 With Postcard disintegrating in the wake of the Josef K split, Haig signed with stylish Belgian independent label Les Disques du Cr√©puscule for mainstream solo releases, and also adopted the moniker Rhythm of Life Organization (RoL) for a variety of side-projects. These included two interim singles on Edinburgh independent Rational, run by manager Allan Campbell. The first of these, Soon, was a collaboration with fellow Edinburgh musician Stephen Harrison (formerly of Metropak), while the second, Uncle Sam, saw Haig guesting on a record by artist Sebastian Horsley. Exploring territory first charted by Public Image Ltd and Heaven 17 in their BEF guise, both singles appeared as Rhythm of Life, this anonymity reflecting Haig's avowed dislike of personal publicity. Also via Rational, he released a limited edition (700 copies) cassette-only set of home-recorded electronica titled Drama, featuring Franz Kafka texts set to music, as well as a deconstruction of Josef K's Forever Drone. In January 1982, Haig played his first solo live shows in Edinburgh and London as Rhythm of Life. At this stage Haig's new material was not so different from late-period Josef K songs such as \\"Heaven Sent\\", \\"Adoration\\" and \\"Heart of Song\\", though with a greater emphasis on a stripped-down funk style. Eschewing a live drummer in favour of a drum machine, RoL earned plaudits from the press, and in February 1982 took part in Cr√©puscule's first European package tour, Dialogue North-South, which also included the Durutti Column, the Names, Marine, Richard Jobson, Isabelle Antena and Tuxedomoon. Haig relocated to Brussels in March 1982 where he embarked on an intensive recording schedule at Little Big One studio. This yielded two self-produced singles, \\"Running Away\\" and \\"Justice\\", as well as \\"Swing In '82\\", an EP of big band standards. After four months Haig tired of Belgium and returned home to Edinburgh. in May 1982, \\"Running Away\\", a cover of the Sly and the Family Stone classic, appeared on Cr√©puscule and reached number 19 on the UK Independent Chart,Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980‚Äì1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 107 its success unhampered by the simultaneous release of another version by the Raincoats.

In July 1982, almost a year after the Josef K split, and with just one proper solo single to his name, Haig was labelled \\"the face and sound of 1982\\" by Paul Morley in a lead feature for the NME. According to Morley, Haig was the \\"enigmatic fourth man\\" in a New Pop quartet which also included Billy Mackenzie, Jim Kerr and Martin Fry, all of them deemed potential pop saviours in a parallel universe where Morley deemed Dollar \\"the most avant-garde group in the world\\". Even by Morley's standards the statement was hyperbolic, although the writer would later go some way towards validating it by directing ZTT signing Propaganda to cover Josef K's song \\"Sorry for Laughing\\" on their debut album A Secret Wish in 1985. Island records, 1983-1984 The media hype around Haig paved the way for a licensing deal with Island Records. At the close of 1982, Haig recorded his first album in New York with Alex Sadkin producing. Featuring a host of crack session players (including Bernie Worrell, Anton Fier and Jack Waldman), his new direction ‚Äì polished club pop ‚Äì sounded radically different from Josef K. The first single released from the album, \\"Heaven Sent\\" (a dance remake of an earlier Josef K song) stalled at No. 74 on the UK Singles Chart, and failed to provide Haig with the hit many had confidently predicted. The Rhythm of Life album appeared in October 1983 and was accompanied by a short seven date UK tour. Haig's touring group included Malcolm Ross on guitar, together with bassist David McClymont (also fresh from Orange Juice), drummer James Locke and former Associate Alan Rankine. None of the three singles released from the album proved solid hits which might have allowed Haig to cross over to a wider audience. Island failed to release the album ‚Äì or the singles ‚Äì in America, although a slick \\"New York Remix\\" mini album was belatedly issued in 1984. Haig later recalled of this period: \\"The main thing was that I didn't want to be the centre of it all. The initial idea was just to keep working with different people under the name Rhythm of Life. But Island wanted a pop image to sell... and they didn't get one.\\" During 1984 Haig collaborated with a number of likeminded post-punk peers, recording electro track \\"The Only Truth\\" with Bernard Sumner of New Order and Donald Johnson of A Certain Ratio respectively, as well as the more experimental \\"The Executioner\\" with Cabaret Voltaire. In November he completed a second album, largely recorded in London with Alan Rankine co-producing. However the chart failure of \\"The Only Truth\\" as a single ultimately led to Island dropping Haig from their roster, and so the untitled second album was shelved. The Warp of Pure Fun, 1985-1987 Rather than release the shelved set on Cr√©puscule, it was decided to combine the best material with several new songs written and recorded throughout 1985. Haig returned at the end of the year with the single, \\"Heaven Help You Now\\", and a reconfigured second album, titled The Warp of Pure Fun. Co-produced with Alan Rankine, it was a more involving collection than its predecessor, offering warmer songs and arrangements, and live drums in place of programmed rhythm tracks. In the UK the album appeared on short-lived Cr√©puscule offshoot, Operation Afterglow, and sold well as an independent release around Europe. Second single \\"Love Eternal\\" has been one of Haig's best regarded songs. Haig spent most of 1986 writing new material and looking for a new major deal. He also found time to embark on a fruitful partnership with another Associate, Billy Mackenzie, the result being low key dates in Glasgow and Edinburgh, which mixed their own greatest hits with covers such as \\"Running Away\\" and Yoko Ono's \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\". Later the pair united to perform \\"Amazing Grace\\" on a Scots Hogmanay television programme, and each donated a song to the other's forthcoming album. \\"Chained\\" proved a highlight on the next Haig album, although Mackenzie's version of \\"Reach the Top\\" remained unreleased after the Associates' Glamour Chase project was shelved by WEA. Following Mackenzie's untimely death in 1997 an entire album of Haig/Mackenzie material, Memory Palace, appeared on Haig's own label Rhythm of Life. In September 1987 Haig briefly returned to Cr√©puscule to record several tracks, resulting in the single \\"Torchomatic\\". This was followed by a compilation album called European Sun which including most of the shelved Island album not included on The Warp of Pure Fun plus several experimental b-side tracks and the previously unreleased Cabaret Voltaire collaboration. Chain, Right on Line, 1988 In 1988 Haig financed the recording of a new album himself, once more produced with Alan Rankine, and eventually issued by Virgin offshoot Circa Records in May of the following year. The title track of Chain was co-written with Billy Mackenzie, while lead single \\"Something Good\\" remains a fan favourite. Live performances were limited to UK and included a showcase at the ICA in London on 18 May. 1988 also saw the release of a single credited to \\"Dub Organiser\\", this being a club cut recorded in collaboration with Allan Campbell and released as a one-off on Manchester indie label Play Hard. Circa financed the recording of a new album produced in New York and Chicago by dance gurus Kurtis Mantronik and Lil Louis. Lead single \\"I Believe in You\\" featured additional mix work by the Chimes, whose drummer James Locke had been a periodic Haig collaborator since 1981. The album marked a return to the dance orientation of Rhythm of Life five years earlier, as Haig explained to Melody Maker: \\"The whole idea was to work with different producers and let them get on with it, which was a departure since I'd produced myself for so long. We recorded the stuff with Mantronik at his Sound Factory studio. He works very quickly, rattling stuff off in a couple of hours. He replaced all my beats with a combination of programming and breakbeats, mostly '70s funk stuff. Lil Louis took a completely different approach. He replaced the rhythm tracks on two of the songs and one we left as was He works with much more basic equipment ‚Äì he's not as computerised as Mantronik. There was absolutely no sampling with Lil Louis, he's much more into the real musician school of thing.\\" Although \\"I Believe in You\\" achieved a measure of club success, Circa delayed releasing Right on Line until a reworked \\"Flight X\\" (featuring rapper Voice of Reason) was issued. When two versions of this track stalled early in 1991 the album was shelved. Coincidence vs Fate and Cinematique, 1991 In September 1991 Haig released an instrumental set of imaginary film themes through LTM, the label which had previously issued the Josef K back catalogue on CD. Cinematique comprised three distinct suites: City of Fun (noir jazz), Lagondola (ambient) and Flashback (electronica). In 1993 Right On Line finally emerged as Coincidence vs Fate on Cr√©puscule, with two new tracks added. Rhythm of Life label years, 1999-present Haig released two more volumes of Cinematique on his own RoL label, as well as several archive releases by his late friend Billy Mackenzie. Memory Palace (1999) compiled a number of tracks recorded as joint demos by the pair, as well as tribute single \\"Listen to Me\\". RoL would also release albums by Skyline and Subterraneans. In 2007, Haig's first single for 14 years, \\"Reason\\" (a BBC Radio 2 single of the week), was released and made available via download and on 7-inch vinyl. This was followed soon after by Electronik Audience which showcased Haig's influences from Kraftwerk and New Order to Cabaret Voltaire. In 2007 he made his first live appearance in many years when he joined Subterraneans onstage at a Billy Mackenzie tribute concert in London. In April 2008 Go Out Tonight, a more organic album than Electronik Audience, was released. In it Haig returned to his guitar-roots, with tracks such as \\"Trouble Maker\\" very reminiscent of early solo recordings such as \\"Chance\\". in April 2008 Haig also embarked on his first tour since 1989, performing both old and new tracks at dates in Scotland and selected shows in Nottingham and London. In December 2009 he released Relive, a studio collection which featured the song \\"Trip Out the Rider\\", later remixed for a 7\\" single release by Lemon Jelly founder Fred Deakin. In 2013, a more experimental electronic album Kube was issued on RoL, followed in 2014 by a comprehensive anthology of Cr√©puscule recordings titled At Twilight.

History  The first volunteer, Herb Feith, travelled to Jakarta, Indonesia in 1951, taking up the challenge to work alongside Indonesians as a translator as the country dealt with issues of independence. His journey helped establish the Volunteer Graduate Scheme to Indonesia. In 1961 the Volunteer Graduate Scheme became the Overseas Service Bureau, an organisation with Jim Webb as its founding Director. In 1963, The Bureau launched a program called Australian Volunteers Abroad (AVA) and the first 14 Australian Volunteers (AVAs) commenced assignments in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tanzania and Nigeria. In 1999 it changed its name to Australian Volunteers International. AVI is governed by a Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer Paul Bird, and a Senior Management Team.

However, Unser was drafted in the first round of the June 1966 draft by the Washington Senators and signed with them, reporting to their Double-A team, the York White Roses of the Eastern League. Unser struggled his first season, in the minors, batting only .220. However, management in Washington saw something in Unser, and in 1968, he made the leap from double-A to the majors. At the age of 23, on April 10, 1968, Unser made his MLB debut, against the team that had drafted him a year earlier, the Minnesota Twins. Unser got a hit in his major league debut.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=unser-001del Unser played for the Washington Senators from 1968 to 1971.

Unser stayed with Washington when the team made its move to Texas to become the Rangers. However, he did not play a game for the franchise in its new city. The Rangers dealt Unser to the Cleveland Indians as part of a seven player deal in 1972. Unser was traded again after one season in Cleveland, this time to the Philadelphia Phillies along with minor league third baseman Terry Wedgewood for Oscar Gamble and Roger Freed on December 1, 1972.Durso, Joseph. \\"A's Send Epstein to Rangers; Scheinblum, Nelson to Reds,\\" The New York Times, Saturday, December 2, 1972.

After the 1974 season, Unser was sent to the New York Mets along with John Stearns and Mac Scarce in exchange for Tug McGraw, Don Hahn and Dave Schneck. He hit .294 for the Mets in 1975, and might have hit .300 that year, but sustained a late- season rib injury which affected his swing. He was hit by a pitch early in the 1976 season and sustained an arm injury, then was traded to the Montreal Expos on July 21. In 1977, he began to be used primarily as a pinch-hitter, and also split his time on the field between the outfield and first base, and in winter of 1978 became a free agent, returning to the Phillies from 1979 to 1982. Unser played a key role in the Phillies' 1980 World Series victory over the Kansas City Royals, getting crucial doubles to drive in runs as a pinch hitter in the late innings of Games 2 and 5. The first cut the Royals' lead from 4-2 to 4‚Äì3 in the bottom of the 8th inning, and scored the tying run before Mike Schmidt drove in the winning run with a double for a 2-0 Series lead for Philadelphia. In Game 5 in Kansas City and with the series tied at two games apiece, the Phillies were at bat in the top of the ninth and trailing by a score of 3‚Äì2. After Schmidt led off with a single, Unser again delivered a double to score Schmidt with the tying run. He later scored the go-ahead run on Manny Trillo's single as the Phillies won the game 4-3 to take a 3‚Äì2 lead in the World Series back to Philadelphia, where they closed it out in the 6th game. Unser played a few more years in Philadelphia after that World Series win.

Post career When Unser played in the minors, one of his coaches was the legendary Harry Walker, aka \\"Harry The Hat\\". Though Unser never hit in the pros the way he did in college, he was a star on defense. After he was released by the Phillies, Unser ran a sporting goods store, then returned to baseball as a coach, returning to the city of Philadelphia.

Due to years of delays in the construction of Lakewood Arena in Bradenton, Florida, the ECHL terminated the franchise on September 28, 2006, more than two years after the franchise was supposed to begin play. History The Swords were the ECHL membership that played in Columbus, Georgia from 2002 until 2004. The franchise originated in Norfolk, Virginia in 1989 as the Hampton Roads Admirals and played at the Norfolk Scope until the completion of the 1999‚Äì2000 ECHL season when the Admirals' ownership obtained a franchise in the AHL as the Norfolk Admirals. The Admirals' owners sold their ECHL franchise rights to the Columbus Cottonmouths, an organization that had been playing in the Central Hockey League, in 2001. In April 2004, the ECHL Board of Governors approved a voluntary suspension request for the franchise and a transfer of home territory request from the membership, allowing the franchise to relocate to Florida. A contest was held to name the relocated franchise in September 2004, with over 3,000 entries received. The winning entry was created by eleven-year-old Mitchell Hudson, whose father Brian suggested the idea of creating a logo after an evening dinner as a way \\"to keep him busy for the weekend.\\" The logo was later debuted in front of seventy people at nearby Lakeland County Club, located several miles from the nearby arena. The Swords were originally granted a waiver to skip the 2004‚Äì05 ECHL season due to their relocation from Columbus, Georgia, and join the league at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 ECHL season. On February 7, 2005, Waldinger-Albridge (the contractor assigned to build the Swords' new arena) halted construction on the new arena. During the league's teleconference in April 2005, ECHL commissioner Brian McKenna attempted to contact DVS Sports, the firm in charge of building the new arena. DVA Sports Vice President Larry Kish did not return any calls. The Swords eventually asked for a second one-year waiver in order for their arena to be completed. Despite a full season without a game played, coach Brian Curran was retained by the team and remained under contract during the franchise's inactive status. After years of mounting debt (estimated to be near $20,000,000 in unpaid bills), several lawsuits, and years of franchise inactivity, the ECHL finally terminated the franchise on September 28, 2006, \\"effective immediately.\\" The decision was made at the annual ECHL Board Of Governors meeting, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The league terminated the franchise based on the belief that construction would never continue. The incomplete, unnamed arena sat at Lakewood Ranch with no activity in the previous eighteen months. A statement from then-ECHL commissioner McKenna said that \\"there's a lot of talk, but we have not been presented with any evidence that it is moving forward. You've got to be building a facility. Even if the project changes hands, that's a long way away from where you need to be.\\" The Schroeder-Manatee Group closed the door on the unbuilt arena on April 21, 2009. The land originally used to build the unnamed arena was purchased by the group at a foreclosure sale for $100. Court battles and bankruptcy hearings (including two for DVS Sports) prevented the property from being sold beforehand. Both Chuck Madden and Larry Kish were both on hand for the foreclosure sale and the end of what they had started. Madden described the sale to be \\"like a funeral\\" to him. Due to changing building codes and an incomplete arena with three concrete walls standing alone, demolition was also considered due to the incomplete building not meeting building codes for hurricane resistance. Coincidentally, one of the arena's potential uses was for it to be used as a hurricane shelter. Local officials decided to raze the remaining walls to the incomplete arena in October 2009. Local residents called the walls an eyesore and mockingly referred to the walls as \\"Stonehenge\\". Instead of exploding the walls and creating more rubble and cleanup, the walls were eventually lowered to the ground by C&M; Road Builders and Southeast Site Development.

Typewriter keyboards and early computer encodings had only one character that looked like this, so its design had to be a compromise between the different typographical appearances. The proper name is rarely used: the character is referred to as a hyphen, a dash or a minus according to the context where it is being used. Description The use of a single character for both hyphen and minus was a compromise made in the early days of fixed-width (monospaced font) typewriters and computer displays. However, in proper typesetting and graphic design, there are distinct characters for hyphens, dashes, and the minus sign. Usage of the hyphen-minus nonetheless persists in many contexts, as it is well known, easy to enter on keyboards, and in the same location in all common character sets. In proportional fonts the hyphen-minus is usually the size of, or slightly bigger than, a hyphen, and smaller than a minus sign (which is usually the same width as a plus sign). This results in an unattractive appearance when mixed with plus signs. Also many word processors will allow a word wrap after a hyphen-minus, unlike the minus sign proper which is treated as a mathematical symbol no different (typographically) from any unspaced number or letter. These differences make its use undesirable in professional typography.  Uses  Typing = This character is often typed when a hyphen, a minus sign or an en dash (as in \\"the Boston‚ÄìLondon flight\\") is wanted. Based on old typewriter conventions, it is common to use a pair to represent an em dash , and some word processors automatically convert this pair to an em dash. The character can also be used in place of the box-drawing character (U+2500) to simulate a horizontal line or alternated with spaces to make a \\"dashed\\" line that indicates where paper is to be cut. = Programming languages = Most programming languages use the hyphen-minus for denoting subtraction and negation. It is almost never used to indicate a range, due to ambiguity with subtraction. Generally other characters, such as the Unicode are not recognized. In some programming languages marks beginning of a comment. Likewise, it can occasionally start the signature block. YAML uses a triple dash to end a section. = Command line = The character is often used when specifying command-line options, a convention mostly started by Unix. Options might be or , a user can specify both by using . Various implementations of the \`getopt\` function allow two hyphen-minuses to specify \\"long\\" option names as , which are much easier to read while being much harder to memorize and write (recent software does not care about the number of hyphen-minuses, and either doesn't allow combinations of single-letter options or require the user to rearrange them so they don't match a long option). A double hyphen-minus by itself (followed by a space) indicates that there are no more options, which is useful when one needs to specify a filename that starts with a hyphen-minus. An option of just a hyphen-minus (followed by a space) may be recognized in lieu of a filename and indicates that stdin is to be read. Encoding The glyph has a code point in Unicode as ; it is also in ASCII with the same value.

In the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he was elected as an MLA for the Foyle constituency. He served for nearly nine months before losing his seat in 2017. In the 2019 election he was elected to Derry City and Strabane District Council. Early life and education McCann was born and has lived most of his life in Derry. Raised Catholic, he attended St. Columb's College and is prominently featured in the documentary film, The Boys of St. Columb's. He later attended Queen's University Belfast, where he was president of the Literary and Scientific Society, the university's debating society. Career As a young man he was one of the original organisers of the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC), a radical campaign group focusing on access to social housing. DHAC organised, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the second civil rights march in Northern Ireland. This march, which took place on 5 October 1968, is generally seen as the birthdate of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. His political contemporaries included Bernadette Devlin, for whom he served as an election agent. He stood for election in the Foyle constituency at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election for the Northern Ireland Labour Party, placing third with 1,993 votes (12.3% of the total). He was tried (as one of the so-called Raytheon 9) in Belfast in May‚ÄìJune 2008 over alleged damage caused during the 2006 War on Lebanon to a facility operated by multinational arms company Raytheon in Derry. The jury unanimously acquitted McCann, and all the other defendants, of charges of criminal damage to property belonging to Raytheon. The jury had heard that the group's actions were prompted by repeated bombing of Lebanese property in which numerous civilians died, and the wish to protect those lives and that property from being attacked by Israeli forces with weapons, weaponry systems and missiles supplied by Raytheon. The judge dismissed charges of affray after hearing the prosecution evidence. However, McCann was convicted of the theft of two computer discs, for which he received a 12-month conditional discharge. In a statement outside the court, McCann said: \\"[We] have been vindicated. ... The jury have accepted that we were reasonable in our belief that ... Israeli ... Forces were guilty of war crimes in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. The action we took was intended to have, and did have, the effect of hampering or delaying the commission of war crimes\\". His appearance at the funeral of former Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer, Old Bailey bomber, and republican activist Dolours Price, and a tribute he paid to her, was criticised by a son-in-law of Jean McConville, who was kidnapped and murdered by the IRA. Price was suspected of being one of the paramilitaries who took part. McCann explained that her family had asked him to speak at her funeral. He said: \\"I don't think I said anything at Dolours Price's grave that contradicted that [calling McConville's murder 'a horrible and unforgivable act'] ... The point I had in mind, the point I was making, was there are some people deeply implicated in the cruel murder of Mrs McConville who appear not to be undergoing any inner turmoil.

He was elected as an MLA for Foyle in May 2016 but lost his seat in January 2017 when the number of seats in the Foyle constituency was reduced from six to five. McCann and People before Profit attracted criticism from Sinn F√©in and pro-EU activists for supporting Brexit in an area with the fourth-highest 'Remain' vote (out of approximately 400 counting areas) in the whole of the United Kingdom.http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/42032 In May 2019 he was elected to Derry and Strabane District Council as a PBP candidate in The Moor electoral area.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ex-speaker- for-dissident-republican-group-gary-donnelly-tops-derry-poll-1.3881478 Campaigning work McCann was central to the setting up of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign; the role of his investigative journalism and decades of campaigning for justice for the Bloody Sunday families was recognised in 2010 when several of the families proposed him for the Paul Foot Award for campaigning journalism. Their citationhttp://www.private-eye.co.uk/paul-foot- award/2010 said: \\"EAMONN McCANN has been using his journalism to campaign for justice for the Bloody Sunday families for almost 40 years. The publication of the Saville Report in June marked a victory for the families, a victory of which McCann was very much a part.\\" In February 1972, within a month of the killings, McCann published the first pamphlet on Bloody Sunday, What happened in Derry. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s he wrote about the injustice of Bloody Sunday whenever he got the opportunity. In the run-up to 1992, the 20th anniversary of the massacre, McCann made a proposal to the families for a book to mark the occasion. The publication of Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened was crucial in helping to bring together all the Bloody Sunday families for the first time into a single campaign. Throughout the 1990s McCann wrote constantly about Bloody Sunday, ensuring that every new piece of evidence about what had happened on the day and in the course of the subsequent cover-up was analysed and publicised. He wrote in the local Derry papers, in the Belfast Telegraph, The Irish Times, the Sunday Tribune, in the London Independent, The Guardian, The Observer ‚Äì anywhere he could place a story. With the announcement of the Saville Tribunal, McCann's writing on Bloody Sunday came into its own. While other journalists focused only on the evidence of the more high-profile witnesses, McCann attended almost every day of the tribunal. He attended the hearings in London's Central Hall, paying his own costs to travel to and from London and staying with family while there. He wrote a weekly analysis for the Sunday Tribune in Dublin, and covered the proceedings daily for the Irish commercial radio station Today FM, as well as contributing articles to the Guardian, Observer, Irish Times, Irish Mirror and Irish Daily Mail. Writings and media work McCann currently writes for the Belfast Telegraph, The Irish Times and the Derry Journal. He has written a column for the Dublin-based magazine Hot Press, and is a frequent commentator on the BBC, RT√â and other broadcast media. He worked as a journalist for the Sunday World newspaper and contributed to the original In Dublin magazine, among others. Much of his journalistic work reflects what he himself describesDear God: The Price of Religion in Ireland (Paperback) by Eamonn McCann, Bookmarks (10 November 1999); ; as a \\"shuddering fascination\\" with religion which, when coupled with his profound skepticism, has made it a topic to which he has often returned. In March 2008, McCann spoke with National Public Radio in the U.S. about the solidarity between the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and the civil rights movement in the U.S. In March 2014, following Crimea's referendum on joining Russia, McCann had a piece published in The Irish Times on the situation there. He commented: \\"After six years in office, Obama believes he has a right to invade anywhere, bomb anything, kill anybody whose jib the CIA doesn't like the cut of, irrespective of national or international law or, indeed, of the provisions of the US constitution. And now he lectures Putin on the necessity of 'respecting international law'. He has a nerve.\\" In the same piece he wrote: \\"Vladimir Putin may run a vicious regime but the people of Crimea have a right to be accepted as Russian if that's what they want, which evidently they do\\", and added: \\"Putin is right that the main motivation of the US and NATO has been to encircle and enfeeble his country. It might be a close-run thing, but in this instance, Russia has more right on its side than the West\\". ;List of works * War and an Irish Town (1973) * War and Peace in Northern Ireland * Dear God ‚Äì The Price of Religion in Ireland He has also edited two books on Bloody Sunday: * Bloody Sunday: What Really Happened (1992) * The Bloody Sunday Inquiry: The Families Speak Out (2005). Personal life McCann was the partner of Mary Holland (1935‚Äì2004), a journalist who worked for The Observer and The Irish Times. He has a daughter from that relationship, Kitty, who is now a journalist for The Irish Times, and a son, Luke, who works for the US- based human rights think tank The Center for Economic and Social Rights (www.cesr.org). The academic and activist Goretti Horgan has been his partner since the mid-1980s and they have an adult daughter, Matty. McCann is a supporter of Derry City F.C..Mahon, Eddie (1998), Derry City, Guildhall Press, p. 83. In the 2002 film Bloody Sunday, McCann was played by Irish actor Gerard Crossan.

Google Books The male line failed and Margaret Bassett heiress to the estate married Edmund Lord Stafford. The estate remained in the ownership of the Earl of Stafford until the attainder and execution of the Duke of Buckingham (the 7th Earl) in 1483, when it passed to the Crown. Thereafter several owners included the Earl of Leicester and from about 1600, the Earl of Essex. The latter's descendants sold the estate in about 1790 to Robert Peel (1750‚Äì1830) a Lancashire textile manufacturer, who was Member of Parliament for Tamworth 1790-1820. Following his death in 1830, his son Robert Peel (1788‚Äì1850), who followed his father into the Tamworth seat and later became Prime Minister, demolished the old manor house and its three storey banqueting house, and replaced it with a grand mansion (incorporating a three storey tower) designed in the Elizabethan style by architect Robert Smirke. In 1843 Drayton Manor received a royal visit from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In farms of the estate the first Tamworth pigs were bred, their place of market being Tamworth. The house ceased to be the principal residence of the Peel family and in 1929 it was demolished. Only the clock tower now remains. The site was sold in 1949 to the Bryan family for the creation of leisure gardens which were later developed to become the Drayton Manor Theme Park. The nearest large town is Tamworth. In 1946 greyhound racing was held at the Tamworth Greyhound Stadium built on the existing cricket ground. Also known as the Drayton Manor Deer Park Racing Track because it used to be the large deer park belonging to the manor. Speedway also took place from 1947-1950 and greyhound racing ceased in the early sixties after the site became housing in the area immediately above Bourne Brook (Dama Road today).

This could seem to be stylistically odd from a modern perspective, as katakana is nowadays (usually) only used in Japanese writing to denote foreign words. However, at the time, katakana rather than hiragana was the preferred syllabary. The limited use of kanji might be viewed as a move to make his poem more accessible to the rural folk of northern Japan with whom he spent his life, or perhaps as similar to American poet E. E. Cummings's style in using primarily lower case.  Notes  * It is important to note that cold summers in Japan mean a poorer harvest, hence the line \\"when the summer is cold, wandering upset.\\" * The transliteration above is not direct, and uses a modern romaji rendering. Miyazawa wrote in the orthography common to his time, where „Ç≥„Éè„Ç¨„É©„Éä„ÇØ„ÉÜ (kohagaranakute) would today be rendered as „Ç≥„ÉØ„Ç¨„É©„Éä„ÇØ„ÉÜ (kowagaranakute), „Ç§„Éí (ihi) as „Ç§„Ç§ (ii), and „Çµ„Ç¶ (sau) as „ÇΩ„Ç¶ (sou). * \\"hidori\\" in \\"hidori no toki ha namida wo nagashi\\" is generally taken as a simple typo, as Miyazawa made similar typos in his other works. But since hidori means the daily wages of day laborers in the dialect of Hanamaki, some people believe the true meaning of this verse is that Miyazawa cries out of sympathy with the poor farmers who have to work as day laborers.

He served as Texas Ranger captain and officer of the Republic of Texas and the United States armies. Walker served in several armed conflicts, including the American Indian Wars and the Mexican-American wars. Biography Samuel Hamilton Walker was born on February 24, 1817 at Toaping Castle, Maryland, to Nathan and Elizabeth (Thomas) Walker, and was the fifth of seven children. =Military= Walker enlisted in the Washington City Volunteers for the Creek Indian Campaign in Alabama in 1836. The following year he mustered out and worked as a scout in Florida until 1841. He arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1842 and served under Captain Jesse Billingsley against a Mexican invasion led by General Adrian Woll. Walker was captured on December 26, 1842 and marched to Mexico City as a prisoner of war. He survived what became known as the Black Bean Episode and was held prisoner for two years before he escaped to Louisiana and returned to Texas. He joined the Texas Rangers in 1844 under the command of Captain John Coffee Hays. Promoted to captain, he led a Ranger company during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, serving with General Zachary Taylor and General Winfield Scott's armies. Walker Colt Walker is best known as the co-inventor of the famous Walker Colt revolver, along with arms manufacturer Samuel Colt. Walker is said to have self-funded a trip to New York City to meet with Colt and proposed to him the concept of a weapon based on the then-popular five-shot Colt Paterson revolver, with many enhancements such as adding a sixth round, being powerful enough to kill either a man or a horse with a single shot and quicker to reload. Colt's firearms company was no longer in business, but the large order allowed Colt to establish a new company. He hired Eli Whitney Junior, already in the arms business, to make his new revolvers. Colt asked Samuel Walker, who happened to be temporarily stationed in Washington, to help him with the design. Colt used his prototype and Walker's improvements to create a new design. Blake produced the first thousand-piece order, known as the Colt Walker. The company then received an order for an additional one thousand more. Colt's share of the profits was $10. By 1847, the new revolver was available. The United States Army's mounted rifle companies were issued them, and they proved extremely effective. The death of Capt. Walker Death Walker was killed on October 9, 1847, at Huamantla, in Tlaxcala, while leading his troops in the Battle of Huamantla during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was struck down by a shotgun (escopeta) fired from a balcony, although popular legend claim he was killed by a lance. The following year, his remains were moved to San Antonio. On April 21, 1856, as part of a battle of San Jacinto anniversary memorial, Walker was reburied in the Odd Fellows' Cemetery at San Antonio. Walker County, Texas, was renamed for him after the original namesake, Robert J. Walker, sided with the Union during the Civil War.

It is generally considered one of Miss Heyer's best Regency romances, and was reportedly the favourite of the author herself.Hodge, JA. The Private World of Georgette Heyer (Bodley Head; 1984) Heyer retained only a single fan letter, which was from a Romanian political prisoner who kept herself and her fellow prisoners sane for twelve years by telling and retelling the plot of Friday's Child. Friday's Child is one of several Heyer romances where the hero and heroine are married early in the novel, and the plot follows their path to mutual love and understanding. Other examples include The Convenient Marriage and April Lady. Plot summary The wild young Viscount Sheringham is fast running through his considerable income through gambling and other extravagant pursuits; and he cannot as yet touch the principal, unless he marries. As the lady with whom he currently fancies himself in love, the beautiful Isabella Milborne, is also an heiress, he proposes. Isabella rejects him unhesitatingly, citing his dissipated lifestyle. A lively quarrel then follows with his obnoxious widowed mother and her brother, who wish to retain control of his father's fortune themselves. The Viscount storms off in a fit of pique, vowing to marry the first female he meets. This turns out to be the pretty but orphaned and shy Hero Wantage, who has secretly loved him since they were children, and who now lives with one of his neighbours in the position of Cinderella, complete with Ugly Sisters. The rest of the novel, chronicling the Viscount's gradual transition to maturity and the realisation that the one he really loves is Hero (the \\"loving and giving\\" child of the title), is told with Miss Heyer's characteristic wit, and features some of her most memorable dialogue, plot twists and characters (such as the fiery but lovelorn George Wrotham, whose hobby is fighting duels).

According to the mission statement published on the company's website, > \\"Cornerstone Theater Company is a multi-ethnic, ensemble-based theater > company. We commission and produce new plays, both original works and > contemporary adaptations of classics, which combine the artistry of > professional and community collaborators. By making theater with and for > people of many ages, cultures and levels of theatrical experience, > Cornerstone builds bridges between and within diverse communities in our > home city of Los Angeles and nationwide.\\" Typically, Cornerstone artists take up residence in the community they will be working with and develop the script for a production. Using members of the community, Cornerstone creates a performance company mixing the professional Cornerstone ensemble with local talent. The resulting plays are often adaptations of classics, but they are always informed by and often address local concerns. These plays are often organized into \\"Cycles\\" which include several related communities. For example, Cornerstone's Faith Based cycles included plays created with members of the Jewish community, Catholics, Muslims, and so on. This artistic strategy is specifically aimed at developing and serving new audiences, and yields a unique theater form that blends professional actors, playwrights and stage designers with artists and actors who are in some way telling their own stories, or the stories of their community.  Origins  Cornerstone was founded by director Bill Rauch and playwright Alison Carey in 1986. The impulse behind the group, according to Carey, was to create theater for audiences that they otherwise would never come in contact with. Gathering a group of theater artists they had worked with while students at Harvard University, Rauch, Carey and their fellow artists picked a destination for their theatrical experiment that none of them had ever visited before: Marmarth, North Dakota. There they performed the Old West Shakespearean adaptation Marmarth Hamlet. For the next five years they traveled to small towns in America, including Port Gibson, Mississippi; Norcatur, Kansas; Dinwiddie, Virginia; and many others, creating theater with the local inhabitants.  Los Angeles  In 1992 the company decided to settle in a city that would allow them access to a wide variety of communities to collaborate with. Since then, the company has expanded its definition of \\"community\\". Initially only defined geographically, the company's collaborations have incorporated religious communities, workplace communities, and age-based communities. For the company's 10th anniversary in 1996, the \\"community\\" was defined as \\"people whose birth date is the same as that of the company\\". While the company normally spends weeks-to-months preparing for performances, the idea of \\"rapid response theater\\" had been suggested since the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which occurred shortly after the troupe's relocation to the city. In April 2006, Michael John Garc√©s replaced Bill Rauch as artistic director. Rauch moved to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. On June 14 of the same year, Garc√©s put the \\"rapid response theater\\" concept into action with staged readings from John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath in protest of the eviction of the South Central Farmers from a privately held plot of land that had been used as a community garden. Starting in the Spring of 2007, Cornerstone began a new cycle of plays concerning the topic of Justice. 2007's Los Illegals concerned the presence of undocumented workers in America, and 2008's Someday focused on reproductive rights in an era when technology makes new interventions and treatments possible. The Justice Cycle will continue through 2009 with three more productions. In 2018, Cornerstone Theater let go of its space in the downtown Los Angeles Arts District. ‚ÄúWe will be carefully considering what and where we want our next physical home to be‚Äîwhat makes sense for a unique organization like ours?‚Äù Garc√©s and Wanlass said in a statement.  Bridge shows  Another unique facet of Cornerstone is the production of the \\"Bridge show\\", a production which links two or more communities together by combining their members into a new show that then performs in each of those communities. At the end of the company's initial rural residencies, Cornerstone and its community partners produced The Winter's Tale: An Interstate Adventure. This musical adaptation of Shakespeare with a cast and crew of 50 from all 12 previous residency communities toured 10,000 miles, culminating Cornerstone's national touring phase.  Cornerstone Institute  Cornerstone Theater Company also operates the educational Cornerstone Institute, which offers theater artists hands-on training in community-based theater. Programs offered include a summer residency, a two- day intensive course, and a semester-long travelling program mentored by Cornerstone staffers.

A non-ideal operational amplifier's equivalent circuit has a finite input impedance, a non-zero output impedance, and a finite gain. A real op-amp has a number of non-ideal features as shown in the diagram, but here a simplified schematic notation is used, many details such as device selection and power supply connections are not shown. Operational amplifiers are optimised for use with negative feedback, and this article discusses only negative-feedback applications. When positive feedback is required, a comparator is usually more appropriate. See Comparator applications for further information.  Practical considerations  Operational amplifiers parameter requirements = In order for a particular device to be used in an application, it must satisfy certain requirements. The operational amplifier must * have large open-loop signal gain (voltage gain of 200,000 is obtained in early integrated circuit exemplars), and * have input impedance large with respect to values present in the feedback network. With these requirements satisfied, the op-amp is considered ideal, and one can use the method of virtual ground to quickly and intuitively grasp the 'behavior' of any of the op-amp circuits below. = Component specification = Resistors used in practical solid-state op-amp circuits are typically in the kŒ© range. Resistors much greater than 1 MŒ© cause excessive thermal noise and make the circuit operation susceptible to significant errors due to bias or leakage currents. = Input bias currents and input offset = Practical operational amplifiers draw a small current from each of their inputs due to bias requirements (in the case of bipolar junction transistor-based inputs) or leakage (in the case of MOSFET-based inputs). These currents flow through the resistances connected to the inputs and produce small voltage drops across those resistances. Appropriate design of the feedback network can alleviate problems associated with input bias currents and common-mode gain, as explained below. The heuristic rule is to ensure that the impedance \\"looking out\\" of each input terminal is identical. To the extent that the input bias currents do not match, there will be an effective input offset voltage present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op-amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., \\"offset null\\" or \\"balance\\" pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem. Operational amplifiers using MOSFET-based input stages have input leakage currents that will be, in many designs, negligible. =Power supply effects= Although power supplies are not indicated in the (simplified) operational amplifier designs below, they are nonetheless present and can be critical in operational amplifier circuit design.  Supply noise  Power supply imperfections (e.g., power signal ripple, non-zero source impedance) may lead to noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified power supply rejection ratio that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).  Using power supply currents in the signal path  Additionally, current drawn into the operational amplifier from the power supply can be used as inputs to external circuitry that augment the capabilities of the operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external push-pull amplifier can be controlled by the current into and out of the operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989 Amplifiers The first example is the differential amplifier, from which many of the other applications can be derived, including the inverting, non- inverting, and summing amplifier, the voltage follower, integrator, differentiator, and gyrator. = Differential amplifier (difference amplifier) = 300px Amplifies the difference in voltage between its inputs. :The name \\"differential amplifier\\" must not be confused with the \\"differentiator\\", which is also shown on this page. :The \\"instrumentation amplifier\\", which is also shown on this page, is a modification of the differential amplifier that also provides high input impedance. The circuit shown computes the difference of two voltages, multiplied by some gain factor. The output voltage :V_\\\\text{out} = \\\\frac{\\\\left( R_\\\\text{f} + R_1 \\\\right) R_\\\\text{g}}{\\\\left( R_\\\\text{g} + R_2 \\\\right) R_1} V_2 - \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{f}}{R_1} V_1 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_1 + R_\\\\text{f}}{R_1} \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{g}}{R_\\\\text{g} + R_2} \\\\right) V_2 - \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{f}}{R_1} V_1. Or, expressed as a function of the common-mode input Vcom and difference input Vdif: :V_\\\\text{com} = (V_1 + V_2) / 2; V_\\\\text{dif} = V_2 - V_1, the output voltage is :V_\\\\text{out} \\\\frac{R_1}{R_\\\\text{f}} = V_\\\\text{com} \\\\frac{R_1 / R_\\\\text{f} - R_2 / R_\\\\text{g}}{1 + R_2 / R_\\\\text{g}} + V_\\\\text{dif} \\\\frac{1 + (R_2 / R_\\\\text{g} + R_1 / R_\\\\text{f}) / 2}{1 + R_2 / R_\\\\text{g}}. In order for this circuit to produce a signal proportional to the voltage difference of the input terminals, the coefficient of the Vcom term (the common-mode gain) must be zero, or :R_1 / R_\\\\text{f} = R_2 / R_\\\\text{g}. With this constraintIf you think of the left-hand side of the relation as the closed-loop gain of the inverting input, and the right-hand side as the gain of the non-inverting input, then matching these two quantities provides an output insensitive to the common-mode voltage of V_1 and V_2. in place, the common-mode rejection ratio of this circuit is infinitely large, and the output :V_\\\\text{out} = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{f}}{R_1} V_\\\\text{dif} = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{f}}{R_1} \\\\left(V_2 - V_1\\\\right), where the simple expression Rf / R1 represents the closed-loop gain of the differential amplifier. The special case when the closed-loop gain is unity is a differential follower, with :V_\\\\text{out} = V_2 - V_1. = Inverting amplifier = 300px An inverting amplifier is a special case of the differential amplifier in which that circuit's non-inverting input V2 is grounded, and inverting input V1 is identified with Vin above. The closed-loop gain is Rf / Rin, hence :V_{\\\\text{out}} = -\\\\frac{R_{\\\\text{f}}}{R_{\\\\text{in}}} V_{\\\\text{in}}\\\\\\\\!\\\\,. The simplified circuit above is like the differential amplifier in the limit of R2 and Rg very small. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between Rf and Rin. To intuitively see the gain equation above, calculate the current in Rin: : i_{\\\\text{in}} = \\\\frac{ V_{\\\\text{in}} }{ R_{\\\\text{in}} } then recall that this same current must be passing through Rf, therefore (because V‚àí = V+ = 0): : V_{\\\\text{out}} = -i_{\\\\text{in}} R_{\\\\text{f}} = - V_{\\\\text{in}} \\\\frac{ R_{\\\\text{f}} }{ R_{\\\\text{in}} } A mechanical analogy is a seesaw, with the V‚àí node (between Rin and Rf) as the fulcrum, at ground potential. Vin is at a length Rin from the fulcrum; Vout is at a length Rf. When Vin descends \\"below ground\\", the output Vout rises proportionately to balance the seesaw, and vice versa.Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p. 342-343. As the negative input of the op-amp acts as a virtual ground, the input impedance of this circuit is equal to Rin. =Non-inverting amplifier= 300px A non- inverting amplifier is a special case of the differential amplifier in which that circuit's inverting input V1 is grounded, and non-inverting input V2 is identified with Vin above, with R1 ‚â´ R2. Referring to the circuit immediately above, :V_{\\\\text{out}} = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{ R_{\\\\text{2}} }{ R_{\\\\text{1}} } \\\\right) V_{\\\\text{in}}\\\\\\\\!\\\\,. To intuitively see this gain equation, use the virtual ground technique to calculate the current in resistor R1: : i_1 = \\\\frac{ V_{\\\\text{in}} }{ R_1 }\\\\,, then recall that this same current must be passing through R2, therefore: : V_{\\\\text{out}} = V_{\\\\text{in}} + i_1 R_2 = V_{\\\\text{in}} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{ R_2 }{ R_1 } \\\\right) Unlike the inverting amplifier, a non-inverting amplifier cannot have a gain of less than 1. A mechanical analogy is a class-2 lever, with one terminal of R1 as the fulcrum, at ground potential. Vin is at a length R1 from the fulcrum; Vout is at a length R2 further along. When Vin ascends \\"above ground\\", the output Vout rises proportionately with the lever. The input impedance of the simplified non-inverting amplifier is high: : Z_{\\\\text{in}} = (1+A_\\\\text{OL}B)Z_{\\\\text{dif}} where Zdif is the op-amp's input impedance to differential signals, and AOL is the open-loop voltage gain of the op-amp (which varies with frequency), and B is the feedback factor (the fraction of the output signal that returns to the input). In the case of the ideal op-amp, with AOL infinite and Zdif infinite, the input impedance is also infinite. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between the impedances driving the V+ and V‚àí op-amp inputs. The feedback loop similarly decreases the output impedance: : Z_{\\\\text{out}} = \\\\frac{Z_{\\\\text{OL}}}{1+A_\\\\text{OL}B} where Zout is the output impedance with feedback, and ZOL is the open-loop output impedance. = Voltage follower (unity buffer amplifier) = 200px Used as a buffer amplifier to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high source impedance to a device with a low input impedance). : V_{\\\\text{out}} = V_{\\\\text{in}} \\\\\\\\! :Z_{\\\\text{in}} = \\\\infty (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself (1 MŒ© to 1 TŒ©), multiplied by the open- loop gain of the op-amp) Due to the strong (i.e., unity gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer data sheet for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation. The input and output impedance are affected by the feedback loop in the same way as the non-inverting amplifier, with B=1. = Summing amplifier = 200px A summing amplifier sums several (weighted) voltages: : V_{\\\\text{out}} = -R_{\\\\text{f}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{V_1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{V_2}{R_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{V_n}{R_n} \\\\right) * When R_1 = R_2 = \\\\cdots = R_n, and R_{\\\\text{f}} independent : V_{\\\\text{out}} = -\\\\frac{R_{\\\\text{f}}}{R_1} ( V_1 + V_2 + \\\\cdots + V_n ) \\\\\\\\! * When R_1 = R_2 = \\\\cdots = R_n = R_{\\\\text{f}} : V_{\\\\text{out}} = -( V_1 + V_2 + \\\\cdots + V_n ) \\\\\\\\! * Output is inverted * Input impedance of the nth input is Z_n = R_n (V_- is a virtual ground) = Instrumentation amplifier = 300px Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements * Is made by adding a non-inverting buffer to each input of the differential amplifier to increase the input impedance. Oscillators Wien bridge oscillator = 300px Produces a very low distortion sine wave. Uses negative temperature compensation in the form of a light bulb or diode. Filters Operational amplifiers can be used in construction of active filters, providing high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, reject and delay functions. The high input impedance and gain of an op-amp allow straightforward calculation of element values, allowing accurate implementation of any desired filter topology with little concern for the loading effects of stages in the filter or of subsequent stages. However, the frequencies at which active filters can be implemented is limited; when the behavior of the amplifiers departs significantly from the ideal behavior assumed in elementary design of the filters, filter performance is degraded. Comparator :200px An operational amplifier can, if necessary, be forced to act as a comparator. The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the supply voltage. However, it is usually better to use a dedicated comparator for this purpose, as its output has a higher slew rate and can reach either power supply rail. Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a comparator.http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/archives/b/thesignal/archive/2012/03/14/op- amps-used-as-comparators-is-it-okay.aspx Integration and differentiation Inverting integrator = The integrator is mostly used in analog computers, analog-to-digital converters and wave-shaping circuits. 300px Integrates (and inverts) the input signal Vin(t) over a time interval t, t0 < t < t1, yielding an output voltage at time t = t1 of :V_\\\\text{out}(t_1) = V_\\\\text{out}(t_0) - \\\\frac{1}{RC} \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} V_\\\\text{in}(t) \\\\,dt, where Vout(t0) represents the output voltage of the circuit at time t = t0. This is the same as saying that the output voltage changes over time t0 < t < t1 by an amount proportional to the time integral of the input voltage: :-\\\\frac{1}{RC} \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} V_\\\\text{in}(t) \\\\,dt. This circuit can be viewed as a low-pass electronic filter, one with a single pole at DC (i.e., where \\\\omega = 0) and with gain. In a practical application one encounters a significant difficulty: unless the capacitor C is periodically discharged, the output voltage will eventually drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range. This can be due to any combination of: * The input Vin has a non-zero DC component, * Input bias current is non-zero, * Input offset voltage is non-zero. A slightly more complex circuit can ameliorate the second two problems, and in some cases, the first as well. 100pxl Here, the feedback resistor Rf provides a discharge path for capacitor Cf, while the series resistor at the non- inverting input Rn, when of the correct value, alleviates input bias current and common-mode problems. That value is the parallel resistance of Ri and Rf, or using the shorthand notation : :R_\\\\text{n} = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{i}} + \\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{f}} } = R_\\\\text{i}  R_\\\\text{f}. The relationship between input signal and output signal is now :V_\\\\text{out}(t_1) = V_\\\\text{out}(t_0) - \\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{i} C_\\\\text{f}} \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} V_\\\\text{in}(t) \\\\,dt. = Inverting differentiator = 300px Differentiates the (inverted) signal over time: :V_\\\\text{out} = -RC \\\\frac{dV_\\\\text{in}}{dt}, where V_\\\\text{in} and V_\\\\text{out} are functions of time. The transfer function of the inverting differentiator has a single zero in the origin (i.e., where angular frequency \\\\omega = 0). The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator. Synthetic elements Inductance gyrator = 300px Simulates an inductor (i.e., provides inductance without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes. Applications where this circuit may be superior to a physical inductor are simulating a variable inductance or simulating a very large inductance. This circuit is of limited use in applications relying on the back EMF property of an inductor as this effect will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op- amp. = Negative impedance converter (NIC) = 300px Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator. In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by: :R_{\\\\text{in}} = -R_3 \\\\frac{R_1}{R_2} In general, the components R_1, R_2, and R_3 need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an impedance. Non-linear Precision rectifier = 250px The voltage drop VF across the forward biased diode in the circuit of a passive rectifier is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of VF. As a result, the voltage drop VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V. The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps. = Logarithmic output = 300px * The relationship between the input voltage and the output voltage is given by: ::V_\\\\text{out} = -V_\\\\text{T} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{in}}{I_\\\\text{S} \\\\, R} \\\\right) :where is the saturation current and is the thermal voltage. * If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the inverting input pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is: ::\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{in}}}{R} = I_{\\\\text{R}} = I_{\\\\text{D}} :where is the current through the diode. As known, the relationship between the current and the voltage for a diode is: ::I_{\\\\text{D}} = I_{\\\\text{S}} \\\\left( e^{\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{D}}}{V_{\\\\text{T}}}} - 1 \\\\right). :This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by: ::I_{\\\\text{D}} \\\\simeq I_{\\\\text{S}} e^{\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{D}}}{V_{\\\\text{T}}}}. :Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage is the negative of the voltage across the diode (), the relationship is proven. This implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects. =Exponential output= 300px * The relationship between the input voltage V_{\\\\text{in}} and the output voltage V_{\\\\text{out}} is given by: :V_{\\\\text{out}} = -R I_{\\\\text{S}} e^{\\\\frac{V{\\\\text{in}}}{V_{\\\\text{T}}}} where I_{\\\\text{S}} is the saturation current and V_{\\\\text{T}} is the thermal voltage. * Considering the operational amplifier ideal, then the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current through the diode is given by: :I_{\\\\text{D}} = I_{\\\\text{S}} \\\\left( e^{\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{D}}}{V_{\\\\text{T}}}} - 1 \\\\right) when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by: :I_{\\\\text{D}} \\\\simeq I_{\\\\text{S}} e^{\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{D}}}{V_{\\\\text{T}}}}.

He was the elder brother of Macgregor Laird. He was one of the first to use iron in the construction of ships. Early years Born in Greenock, Scotland, the eldest son of Scottish entrepreneur, William and Agnes (n√©e Macgregor) Laird, John Laird was raised in Liverpool and educated at that city's Royal Institution. In 1824 the Laird family moved to Birkenhead, where William Laird and Daniel Horton established the Birkenhead Iron Works. This manufactured boilers near Wallasey Pool. This partnership was dissolved in 1828 and William Laird was joined in his business by John Laird, who had been a solicitor's articled clerk. The company was renamed William Laird & Son. Shipbuilding Laird realised that the techniques of bending iron plates and riveting them together to build ships were similar to the principles involved in making boilers. Laird's first vessel was a 60 ft pre-fabricated iron lighter in 1829 ‚Äì displacement sixty tons ‚Äì which was used on canals and lakes in Ireland. This was followed by further orders for more lighters and in 1833 the paddle steamer Lady Lansdowne was built for the same firm. Many of the orders were for pre-fabricated river steamers. In 1834, he built the paddle steamer John Randolph for Savannah, Georgia, stated to be the first iron ship seen in America. For the East India Company, he built in 1839 the Nemesis, the first iron vessel carrying guns. In 1839 Lairds built their first screw-propelled steamer, Robert F. Stockton, a 63 ft tug for use on North American waterways. By 1840, Lairds had built another 21 iron paddle-steamers including four gun boats for anti-piracy patrols for the British East India Company. Further orders for paddle frigates included the 1,400 ton HMS Birkenhead (which he designed) of 1848 which was famously wrecked off South Africa with the loss of over 400 soldiers in 1852. Perhaps their most famous vessel was the Confederate raider CSS Alabama. In 1857 the business moved to a new yard upstream from the Woodside Ferry, where it remained. In 1844 John Laird started the construction of the Birkenhead Docks in the tidal Wallasey Pool. These were intended to compete with the Port of Liverpool but the venture was not a success and the system was merged with Liverpool docks in 1858. In October 1863, Laird and his shipbuilding company were caught making two naval ram vessels for the Confederate States Navy: El Toussoun and El Monastir. The Royal Navy additionally deployed a gunship, HMS Heron, to the area to prevent the half constructed ships from leaving the port. Laird then sued the British government for impeding on his construction because their construction did not violate the 1819 Foreign Enlistment Act nor British neutrality. In fact, the Lincoln Administration had requested Laird to build armed iron clads for the Union in 1861. Personal life Alabama' and the 'Captain'\\"Laird as MP, caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, May 1873 In 1829 Laird married Elizabeth Hurry. In 1860, John Laird was joined in partnership by his three sons, William, John and Henry. However, John Laird retired in 1861 and the business was taken over by his sons. It merged with Charles Cammell & Co to form Cammell Laird in 1903. He was the first mayor of Birkenhead and as chairman of the Birkenhead Improvement Commission, he played a key role in the development of the town. He was one of the first Commissioners in 1833, which were appointed to erect a market, to light and clean the streets and to maintain a police force. When Birkenhead became a Parliamentary Borough in 1861, John Laird retired from shipbuilding to become its first Member of Parliament for Birkenhead. He served from 1861 to 1874 as a Conservative. He was also Deputy Lieutenant of Cheshire and Justice of the Peace. He contributed a great deal to the continuous improvement of the town as a benefactor. Laird was responsible for the building of the Dock Cottages. He made some generous donations for the erection of Saint James Church, the Borough Hospital and the Laird School of Art. Death/legacy He died at his home, 63 Hamilton Square, Birkenhead, following a riding accident. He is buried in the grounds of Birkenhead Priory, next to his yard. An appeal for donations for a statue of John Laird quickly raised more than required from nearly 2,400 donors. The statue was sculpted by Albert Bruce-Joy. Over 2,000 people walked in procession for the statue's unveiling in 1877. It was unveiled by his friend, Lord Tollemache. The statue now stands in Hamilton Square in the centre of Birkenhead, though it was moved from its original position to make way for a cenotaph.

It was built as a council housing estate with homes spread across 'streets in the sky': social housing characterised by broad aerial walkways in long concrete blocks, much like the Park Hill estate in Sheffield; it was informed by, and a reaction against, Le Corbusier's Unit√© d'Habitation. The estate was built by the Greater London Council, but subsequently the London Borough of Tower Hamlets became the landlord. The scheme, the first major housing scheme built by the Smithsons, consisted of two blocks, one of 10 and one of seven storeys; it embodied ideas first published in their failed attempt to win the contract to build the Golden Lane Estate. A redevelopment scheme, known as Blackwall Reach, involves the demolition of Robin Hood Gardens as part of a wider local regeneration project that was approved in 2012. An attempt supported by a number of notable architects to head off redevelopment by securing listed status for the estate was rejected by the government in 2009. The demolition of the western block began in December 2017. The eastern block, which is still inhabited by tenants, is to be demolished later. The site will contain 1,575 residences.Jessica Mairs, \\"Bulldozers move in on Robin Hood Gardens\\", Dezeen, 25 August 2017. Part of the building has been preserved by the Victoria and Albert Museum and was presented at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2018. Location left The Robin Hood Gardens estate was on a tight site, in Poplar, in east London. To the south is Poplar High Street, and then the A1261; to the north Woolmore Street, then the A13 East India Dock Road; to the west is Cotton Street, which links the A13 to the Isle of Dogs and Canary Wharf, while to the east is Robin Hood Lane and the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach Road. In 1885 the insanitary back-to-back slums were replaced by seven tenement blocks known as Grosvenor Buildings. These were demolished in 1965, whereupon five acres became available linking other brownfield space. The complex was at the north end of the Blackwall Tunnel, where a station of the Docklands Light Railway was built in the 1990s to link the City of London to Canary Wharf. It was within sight of the nearby Balfron Tower, both highly visible examples of Brutalist architecture. Description The west side (inner side) of the 10 storey east block The west side (outer side) of the west block Streets in the sky, looking north-west across Cotton Street =Design philosophy= The Smithsons were influential architects from the Architectural Association group, who had failed to win the Golden Lane Estate contract, but published and promoted their radical design. They proposed that the building was not the fundamental unit of architecture but it was the network of pathways that was. They did not place buildings on a fixed rectilinear grid as was normal for modernist buildings, but on pathways used by the residents. They saw the needs of the pedestrian were different from those of the motorist and the service vehicle. Pathways in the sky had been used before by architects, such as Michiel Brinkman‚Äôs Spangenblok Housing (1912) in Rotterdam, but it was tied to the existing street pattern, and the pathways the Smithsons proposed to use in Golden Lane were independent and non-rectilinear. Robin Hood Gardens was a physical implementation of these earlier principles. = Estate = The estate consisted of two long curved blocks facing each other across a central green space, and in total covered . The blocks were of ten storeys (east) and seven storeys (west), built from precast concrete slab blocks and contain 213 flats. Construction began in 1968, the first flats opened in 1971, and the scheme as a whole was completed in 1972 at a cost of ¬£1,845,585. In the central green area was a small man-made hill. = Living space = The flats themselves were a mixture of single-storey apartments and two-storey maisonettes, with two to six bedrooms. The maisonettes were designed with the bedrooms facing inwards shielding the residents from the traffic noise. Another design feature was the wide balconies (the \\"streets\\") on every third floor, the concept being to provide public space which would encourage interaction. Alcoves called \\"pause spaces\\" were provided next to the entrance doorways on the \\"streets\\" which the Smithsons hoped the residents would personalise and where children would play. As with many other council housing blocks in the UK, tenures diversified somewhat and included social housing tenants, leaseholders who exercised the right to buy and subsequent private owners, and private tenants of leaseholders. Reception The design of the estate contained many flaws. The \\"streets in the sky\\" concept often did not work in practice. The walkways and especially the enclosed stairwells contained numerous blind spots, including the alcoves in front of doors (the architects called them pause places). Unlike a true city street, there was a lack of regular passers-by to act as a deterrent to crime and disorder. This is the concept referred to as \\"eyes on the street\\" by Jane Jacobs in The Death and Life of Great American Cities. This was because the walkways were not thoroughfares and mostly ended with an above-ground dead end. As a result, the only people who shared the walkways with their residents were the drug dealers and muggers who preyed on them. Furthermore, a resident could not easily escape trouble if they encountered it in the walkway.https://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/streets-in-the-sky-the- urban-idiot/ The exposed concrete weathered poorly, and by the time of demolition was in poor repair.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/05/robin-hood- gardens-east-london The site was also cut off from its surroundings by roads, and the design decision to turn the entire development inwards - a situation worsened by surrounding it with a prison-like concrete wall - meant that the possibility of any saving grace of a positive relationship with its surroundings was lost. A doctoral thesis from 1982 gives a damning verdict: \\"The access to the building is, to our mind, ill-conceived: the ‚Äòstress-free‚Äô zone is abused: the lack of common privacy is a constant worry: the vicious writing-on-the-wall is hard to ignore, and is undeniably related to much of the mindless vandalism that has broken down the communal facilities. The tenants do not make use of the decks and, consequently, the idea of ‚Äòstreet‚Äô does not have any factual validity‚Ä¶[Our] final assessment must be that, socially, the building does not work. The lucidly argued Smithson aesthetic fails at Robin Hood.\\"John Furse, The Smithsons at Robin Hood, University of Sussex PhD, 1982 Redevelopment plans The Council declared the site to be part of a larger regeneration area named Blackwall Reach, bounded by East India Dock Road to the north, the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach (A102) and East India Docks to the east, Aspen Way to the south and Cotton Street to the west.Blackwall Reach at English Partnerships website (2008) It plans to provide 1,575 new homes across an expanded area along with improvements to the primary school, a new park and other community facilities. Only 698 of the units (45%) will be \\"affordable\\" In April 2010, Tower Hamlets shortlisted groups of architects, housing associations and developers to undertake the ¬£500 million project.More vie to redevelop Robin Hood Gardens, Building Design, 23 April 2010 Before the final announcement, the designs for replacement buildings were condemned in The Observer as \\"generic developers' fare, with... no sense of place\\".Rowan Moore, Robin Hood Gardens: don't knock it‚Ä¶ down, The Observer, 3 December 2010. Swan Housing Association was selected, with a plan to replace the current estate of 252 homes with up to 1,700, of which 700 would be for social housing and shared ownership. It would also include open space, community facilities, and better connections to the surrounding area. The demolition plans were passed by Tower Hamlets Council on 15 March 2012. Final planning approval for the redevelopment scheme was given in December 2012. There was a lengthy period clearing the flats of their residents ‚Äî both tenants and owners who had taken advantage of Right to Buy. A case study published in The Big Issue magazine shows one owner was offered ¬£178,000 by the council for her two-bedroom flat at Robin Hood Gardens, when an equivalent property in Poplar would cost ¬£347,000. If she accepted a shared ownership proposal, it would be seven years before she regained full ownership.

It has added two sections of the estate's garden and street-facing facades, including one of its elevated walkways that were central to the Smithsons \\"streets in the sky\\" concept. The section of the facade reaches almost 9 metres in height and 5.5 metres in width, representing a full section of the repeating pattern of prefabricated parts that form the buildings' faces. Original fittings, including cabinetry that forms some of the interior walls, are included. The Smithsons on their work The project was the subject of a BBC documentary The Smithsons on Housing (1970), made by B. S. Johnson, in which both Smithsons are interviewed. The Smithsons reflected on the role of the architect, and how in the twentieth century they have been required to implement several visions. In the 1920s, the need had been for garden cities isolated from the industrialised city, this was followed for the need for sun filled high rise flats isolated and separated from the services on the ground. To reconnect families with each other, the Smithsons designed streets in the air that were to emulate the terraced housing of the Georgian period; they would, by design, block out the noise and look over a green central communal area.Sukhdev Sandhu \\"You're Human Like The Rest Of Them ‚Äì the NFT's celebration of BS Johnson\\", telegraph.co.uk, 16 June 2009 Although Peter Smithson admitted he had been driven by a combination of urgency, practicality and idealism, he claimed in a 1990s interview that the project had failed, although he largely blamed social issues rather than architectural ones for this failure.Rebuilding Britain for the Baby Boomers, introduced by Maxwell Hutchinson, BBC Radio 4, 26 November 2011 > \\"In other places you see doors painted and pot plants outside houses, the > minor arts of occupation, which keep the place alive.

It is found within the scala tympani and scala vestibuli of the cochlea. The ionic composition of perilymph is comparable to that of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The major cation in perilymph is sodium, with the values of sodium and potassium concentration in the perilymph being 138 mM and 6.9 mM, respectively. It is also named Cotunnius' liquid and liquor cotunnii for Domenico Cotugno. Structure The inner ear has two major parts, the cochlea and the vestibular organ. They are connected in a series of canals in the temporal bone referred to as the bony labyrinth. The bone canals are separated by the membranes in parallel spaces referred to as the membranous labyrinth. The membranous contains two fluids called perilymph and endolymph. The perilymph in the bony labyrinth as connection to the cerebrospinal fluid of the subarachnoid space via the perilymphatic duct. =Composition= Perilymph and endolymph have unique ionic compositions suited to their functions in regulating electrochemical impulses of hair cells necessary for hearing. The electric potential of endolymph is ~80-90 mV more positive than perilymph due to a higher concentration of potassium cations (K+) in endolymph and higher sodium (Na+) in perilymph. This is referred to as the endocochlear potential. Perilymph is the fluid contained within the bony labyrinth, surrounding and protecting the membranous labyrinth; perilymph resembles extracellular fluid in composition (sodium salts are the predominate positive electrolyte) and, via the cochlear aqueduct (sometimes referred to as the \\"perilymphatic duct\\"), is in continuity with cerebrospinal fluid. Endolymph is the fluid contained within the scala media of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear and within the semicircular canals of the vestibular apparatus; endolymph resembles intracellular fluid in composition (potassium is the main cation). Apart from the importance in the electric cochlear potential, the perilymph also contains a large number of proteins, e.g. extracellular enzymes and immunoglobulins. These proteins are important for the metabolism, immune response and metabolism among others physiological functions. Clinical significance It has also been suggested that perilymph and endolymph participate in a unidirectional flow that is interrupted in M√©ni√®re's disease.

He was the eldest son of Sultan al-Dawla.  Struggle for supremacy over the Buyid kingdom  The death of Sultan al-Dawla in 1024 prompted a succession crisis within the Buyid state. Not until 1027 did the army in Baghdad pick his brother Jalal al-Dawla as ruler. In the meantime Abu Kalijar had built up his power in Fars, although the first several years of his reign were marked by the oversight of his tutor, a eunuch named Sandal. and entered into a conflict with the Buyid ruler of Kerman, Qawam al-Dawla. The latter's death in 1028 allowed Abu Kalijar to occupy the province. In 1030, Jalal al-Dawla sent a fleet of 1300 ships under his vizier Abu Ali Hasan to capture Basra from Abu Kalijar, but the expedition was a disaster and ended in a complete defeat. Abu Ali Hasan was then taken prisoner, but was soon released. Abu Kalijar shortly sent an army under his vizier Bahram ibn Mafinna, who managed to conquer Khuzistan. Abu Kalijar then made Ahvaz his capital. In 1033 the Ghaznavids invaded Kerman, with the object of overrunning the Buyid states. However, the financial obligations imposed on the people of Kerman convinced them that Buyid rule would be preferable. In the following year, Bahram ibn Mafinna expelled the Ghaznavids from the province. Abu Kalijar also wanted to gain control of Iraq. Around 1037 his army marched on Baghdad; although he did not take the city, Jalal al-Dawla recognized him as senior amir. Abu Kalijar subsequently used the title \\"Shahanshah\\" on his coins. However, the amir of Mosul, along with the Arab tribe of the Asadids, supported Jalal al-Dawla, and the two Buyids were forced to come to a compromise. Both rulers used the same titles and were genuinely independent of each other. Iraq therefore stayed out of Abu Kalijar's control, though he managed to make his son the governor of Basra. In 1041/1042, Bahram ibn Mafinna died, and was succeeded by Dhu'l-Sa'adat as the vizier of Abu Kalijar. Jalal al-Dawla's death in 1044 gave Abu Kalijar possession of Iraq. His control over the region, however, remained weak; his capital therefore remained in Ahvaz, instead of being moved to Baghdad. In the meantime, the Kakuyids of Isfahan were torn between two rival brothers, and Abu Kalijar attempted to force them to submit to his authority. They preferred, however, to recognize the Seljuks as their overlords. During the same year, Abu Kalijar strengthened the walls of Shiraz.  Height of power and death  Abu Kalijar continued to cement his authority by traveling to Baghdad, where he received the title of senior amir as well as the title \\"Muhyi al-Din\\" (\\"Reviver of Religion\\"). Several minor rulers of Mesopotamia recognized his authority, and even the Kakuyids declared their allegiance. This last act, however, prompted a Seljuk intervention, and Abu Kalijar decided to negotiate and create a marriage alliance. The Buyid governor of Kerman, however, decided to submit to the Seljuk Qavurt. Abu Kalijar marched to reassert his authority, only to be met with an ambassador of the governor, who brought gifts and a promise to renew his allegiance. Shortly afterwards, Abu Kalijar died at the age of thirty-eight. He was succeeded by his son al-Malik al-Rahim, but the Buyids suffered a succession struggle soon after his death, and Kerman entered into the Seljuk orbit.

Use A chef's knife Today the butcher knife is used throughout the world in the meat processing trade. The heftier blade works well for splitting, stripping and cutting meat. The French chef's knife is a derivation of the butcher knife, and is used as a general utility knife. Other similar meat-cutting knives include the carving knife and the cleaver. The carving knife usually is designed for slicing thin cuts of meat and often has a blunt or rounded point, with a scalloped or Granton blade to improve separation of sliced cuts of meat. The cleaver is similar to the butcher's knife, but has a lighter and thinner blade for precision cutting. History Old carving knife and carving forks, non-stainless steel. Stag handles. Note folding fork guards. From the late 18th century to the mid-1840s, the butcher knife was a key tool for mountain men. Simple, useful and cheap to produce, they were used for everything from skinning beaver, cutting food, self- defense, and scalping. During this time John Wilson, of Sheffield, England, was a major exporter of this type of knife to the Americans. These knives can be identified by brand markings and the stamp I. Wilson. Heavy cleavers were traditionally hung on a hook blade up for ease of access. Hook through the blade keeps the blade under control and leaves easy access to the handle when hung at chest height or a little bit higher.

After the presidential election, in which Wade was re-elected, Wade mentioned Dansokho as one of several opposition politicians who would be facing prosecution for corruption. Dansokho was accused of selling lands around the international airport while he was Minister of Urban Planning and of embezzling 17 million CFA francs as mayor of K√©dougou.

Dansokho was not included on the municipal candidate list of the Benno Siggil Senegaal opposition coalition for K√©dougou in the March 2009 local elections. According to Dansokho, he had already told the PIT Secretariat that he did not want to be mayor again due to poor health, but he still felt able to serve as a municipal councillor; nevertheless, he was not included on the opposition's municipal list.

History  The company started in 1948 when WCRB first signed on at 1330 AM. In 1954, Charles River Broadcasting added WCRB-FM at 102.5 FM. In the mid 1970s, WCRB's programming was removed from the 1330 AM signal, which was relaunched as WHET, with a big-band/adult standards format. (WHET was sold in 1978 and is now WRCA.) By the early 1990s, Charles River Broadcasting and WCRB entered into a commitment for the station to continue running classical music until 2092. Later in the decade, the company purchased WFCC-FM Chatham, WKPE-FM Orleans (both on Cape Cod), WCRI Block Island/Westerly (formerly WVBI), and WCNX Hope Valley, Rhode Island (formerly WJJF) (both in Rhode Island) from their respective local owners. In addition, a satellite service named the World Classical Network was started by Charles River Broadcasting. The company explored a sale possibility for its stations (effectively interpreting the commitment as a request and not an order), and announced in December 2005 that they were selling WCRB to Greater Media, and announced the sale of WCRI/WCNX to Judson Group, headed by Christopher Jones, in January 2006 . Jones was a minister in the Waltham Unitarian Universalist Church, one of the few Unitarians to own a broadcasting property in the U.S. The WCRB deal with Greater Media was closed on July 31, 2006, and Greater Media announced that it would sell the physical property of WKLB-FM and the intellectual property of WCRB to Nassau Broadcasting, in exchange for WCRB's more powerful Boston signal. That deal was consummated on December 1, 2006 at noon, when WKLB's country music format moved to 102.5 FM, and WCRB's classical music format moved to 99.5 FM. In April 2007, the remnants of Charles River Broadcasting (at the time doing business as CRB Media) were WFCC and WKPE (now WOCN-FM) as well as the World Classical Network.

Ebbetts is the eastern of two passes in the area traversed by State Route 4. The western pass is the Pacific Grade Summit (el ). The pass is registered as a California Historical Landmark. The Pacific Crest Trail, a long National Scenic Trail crosses State Route 4 at Ebbetts Pass. History Native Americans were undoubtedly the first humans to traverse the Sierra Nevada Mountains, but it is unknown if they regularly used Ebbetts Pass since any trail they would have used is no longer traceable. It is traditionally held to be the pass used by Jedediah Smith in late spring of 1827 when leaving California at the end of his first exploratory journey, the first crossing ever of the Sierra Nevada by a non- native, but snow would have obscured any trail so he was blazing his own path. It may also have been used by the Bartleson‚ÄìBidwell Party on their emigration to California. John Ebbets, a fur trader turned guide for California Gold Rush \\"Forty-niners\\" claimed to have led a string of pack mules easterly over the Sierras in the vicinity of Ebbetts Pass in April 1851. He believed the pass he had used would be suitable for the transcontinental railroad, as he noted little snow at the time. He later surveyed near the pass for a possible railroad route, but found it unsuitable. He intended to return to the pass itself to survey it for a road but was killed in the explosion of the steamboat Secretary on San Pablo Bay in 1854 before he could do so. While the pass was referred to by his name earlier, it was not until 1893, when the U.S. Geological Survey surveyed the Markleeville quadrangle, that the pass was officially named after him. The route was used only occasionally until silver was discovered east of the Sierra, and merchants in Murphys had a road constructed to Markleeville to more easily transport supplies over the pass to the miners. This became a toll road in 1862. From Markleeville, travel further eastward was taken along established routes. It was not until the early 1950s that the road over Monitor Pass to U.S. Route 395 was completed, connecting the eastern terminus of State Route 4 to U.S. Route 395 via State Route 89 near the community of Topaz. Ebbetts Pass was designated as a California State Scenic Highway in 1971; it was similarly honored with National Scenic Byway status on September 22, 2005. It is one of only seven nationally so-designated byways in California, and of 151 in the entire nation. Current usage Historical marker at Ebbetts Pass Today, Ebbetts Pass is one of the least traveled passes in the Sierra Nevada. A 23-mile stretch between Lake Alpine and Centerville Flat is less than two lanes, and lacks a dividing line between them.https://www.aaroads.com/guides/ca-004-east-alpine/ It has very steep sections with hairpin corners. The eastern slope is particularly difficult, as many of the hairpin corners are blind, and steepen suddenly at the apex, making it necessary to shift to first gear in most vehicles. It is rarely used by commercial traffic and is not recommended for vehicles towing long trailers. Furthermore, the pass usually closes during the winter months, often from November through as late as May.

It was remodelled by Henry Flitcroft, as \\"Montagu House\\", for George Montagu, created 1st Duke of Montagu, who had moved from nearby Bloomsbury. It was refurbished once again, by Henry Holland for the Prince Frederick, Duke of York, from 1788 to 1792. The building belonged to the Melbourne family from 1793 to 1830. It has also been home to a French ambassador and Lady Caroline Lamb, with whom the Romantic poet Lord Byron famously had an affair. Its most notable feature is an entrance hall in the form of a rotunda inserted into the former forecourt by Holland, which is a unique entrance to a London mansion. The last private owners were the family of the Whig politician George James Welbore Agar-Ellis, created (1831) Baron Dover, whose title it has retained. Government use The Agar-Ellis heirs owned Dover House from 1830 to 1885, when it became the Scottish Office, the UK government department responsible for Scottish affairs.

Up to the end of the 17th century, mercantile ideas were gaining force in England and giving general shape to trade policy through a series of Navigation Acts. From the early 18th century to 1763, salutary neglect was employed. After 1763, Britain began to try to enforce stricter rules and more direct management, leading eventually to the American Revolutionary War. Origins The policy was formalised by Robert Walpole after he took the position of Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in 1721, working with Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle. In an effort to increase tax income, Walpole laxed the enforcement of trade laws and decreased regulations, stating: ‚Äúif no restrictions were placed on the colonies, they would flourish‚Äù. Walpole did not believe in enforcing the Navigation Acts, established under Oliver Cromwell and Charles II, which required goods traded between the United Kingdom and her colonies had to be carried on English ships, as part of the larger economic strategy of mercantilism. The policy went unnamed until the term was coined in Edmund Burke's \\"Speech on Conciliation with America\\", given in the House of Commons on March 22 1775. The speech praised the governance of the British America, which \\"through a wise and salutary neglect\\", achieved great commercial success. :When I know that the colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours, and that they are not squeezed into this happy form by the constraints of watchful and suspicious government, but that, through a wise and salutary neglect, a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection; when I reflect upon these effects, when I see how profitable they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power sink, and all presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt and die away within me. Effects The policy succeeded in increasing money flow from the colonies to Britain. The lack of enforcement of trading laws meant American merchants profited from illegal trading with French possessions in the Caribbean, which Britain prospered from in turn as American merchants purchased more British goods. The Laissez-faire nature of the policy led to the colonies being de facto independent. The policy helped develop a sense of independence and self-sufficiency and enabled colonial assemblies to wield significant power over the royally appointed governors through their control of colony finances. Additionally, Walpole's willingness to fill the unpopular colonial offices with friends and political allies led to an ineffective king's authority overseas.  End of Policy  From 1763 Britain began to try to enforce stricter rules and more direct management, driven in part by the outcome of the Seven Years' War in which Britain had gained large swathes of new territory in North America at the Treaty of Paris. The war meant that Britain had accrued large debts and it was decided to deploy troops in the colonies to defend them from continued threats from France. Prime Minister George Grenville thus proposed additional taxes supplementing the Navigation Acts known as the Grenville Acts: the Sugar Act 1764, the Currency Act 1764 and, the Stamp Act 1765 all aimed at increasing authority in and revenue from the colonies. These were unpopular in the colonies, leading to the Stamp Act riots in August 1765 and the Boston Massacre in March 1770. The Grenville Acts, as well as the Intolerable Acts, were defining factors that led to the American Revolutionary War.  Deliberateness of Policy  To what extent \\"salutary neglect\\" constituted an actual neglect of colonial affairs, as the name suggests, versus a conscious policy of the British government, is controversial among historians, and also varies with national perspective. While Americans may side with Burke on the \\"salutary\\" effect of this policy, emphasizing the economic and social development of the colonies, it was from a British imperial perspective a momentous failure, and debate remains as to its true social, economic, and political effects. The Board of Trade, which enforced mercantilist legislation in the United Kingdom, was too weak to enforce its own laws until 1748. Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, became the relevant Secretary of State in 1724, but took time to learn the duties of his office, and even after that he was not firm in his action, causing historian James Henretta to blame salutary neglect on \\"administrative inefficiency, financial stringency, and political incompetence\\".

He was always concerned for broader social issues. He witnessed the poverty of the working classes in the slums of Edinburgh and saw similarities to the rural poverty he witnessed as a child. Nicholas Rea, in the British Medical Journal, said of Pitt: \\"it was in the slums of Edinburgh as much as in the Caribbean that he became convinced of the links between poverty, disadvantage, and ill health\\".Nicholas Rea, British Medical Journal, Vol. 310, No. 6971 (7 January 1995), p. 54. In 1936, he joined the Labour movement. He returned to the Caribbean to begin his medical career, his first job being as district medical officer in Saint Vincent, followed two years later by a position in Trinidad as house physician at San Fernando Hospital. Continuing his passion for social justice alongside his medical career, and he established his own general practice in San Fernando in 1941 and that year was elected to the San Fernando Borough Council. In 1943, he became a founding member and leader of the West Indian National Party (WINP) ‚Äì a socialist party whose main aim was to deliver political autonomy across the Caribbean. Under Pitt, the party demanded self-government for Trinidad and Tobago, constitutional reform and the nationalisation of commodities industries such as oil and sugar.Jennette Arnold, \\"Echoes of our past: A series of reflections by prominent black people\\". After decades of campaigning, the people of Trinidad and Tobago were granted universal adult suffrage by the British Parliament in 1945. The first elections took place in 1946. WINP and others formed the United Front with Pitt as one of the candidates. He was not successful but he continued his activism and in 1947 led a group of WINP members to Britain to lobby the Attlee government for Commonwealth status for a Federation of the West Indies. In 1947, Pitt again travelled to Britain and settled in London. He opened a medical practice in the Euston area of London and treated both white and black patients. Political career in Britain In the 1959 general election, he was the first person of African descent to be a parliamentary candidate, standing as the Labour Party candidate for the north London constituency of Hampstead. From the mid-1950s, Pitt had become involved in local politics. After delivering a speech at the 1957 Labour Party Conference, he was asked by Roy Shaw OBE, the then treasurer of Tribune, if he would stand for Parliament. The issues of race were injected into the campaign, and Pitt was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate, Henry Brooke. During the course of the campaign, Pitt received racist death threats, as did his family; however, despite the racist abuse, he refused to withdraw from the contest.\\"UK Negro Candidate Threatened\\", Montreal Gazette, 22 September 1959.

Furthermore, all food transactions involve transfers and exchanges of Nu (Meigs, 1997 p. 99). Nu is contained within bodily fluids, bodily substances, and any bodily product. It can take a positive or negative effect on the people surrounding it, leading to exceptional growth and health, or contributing to a lack of growth and health. Social relationships are also influenced by the substance of Nu. Sources *Meigs, Anna. Food as a Cultural Construction. Food and Culture: A Reader. Ed. Carole Counihan and Penny van Esterik.

Home games were played at the Roanoke Civic Center in Roanoke, Virginia. History Roanoke Valley's first minor league ice hockey team, called the Salem Rebels, played its inaugural season at the Salem Civic Center in the 1967-1968 season with Jim Jago as team captain. The first season had some sparse crowds of less than 1,000 in the 4,848 seat arena. Over the next few years, the team developed a fanbase and a number of games were sold out. In 1971, the team moved to the newly built Roanoke Civic Center near downtown Roanoke and were renamed the Roanoke Valley Rebels. For most of the 1980s and early 1990s, various teams such as the Virginia Lancers and Roanoke Valley Rampage played in a custom built facility called the LancerLot in Vinton. The Virginia Lancers were owned by Henry Brabham, who also owned a chain of convenience stores named Lancer Mart. The roof of the LancerLot collapsed as a result of heavy snowfall during the Blizzard of 1993 resulting in hockey moving back to the Roanoke Civic Center. Joining the ECHL The Express proved to be a success both on the ice and in drawing more fans than previous hockey teams in the Roanoke Valley. During the mid to late 1990s, some crowds nearly filled the over 9,000 seat civic center. In 1995-1996, average attendance was 5,679. The team's hard-nosed style of play reflected their coach, Frank Anzalone, who later coached the ECHL's Johnstown Chiefs. The Express typically had outstanding goalkeeping with Daniel Berthiaume and Dave Gagnon. The team continued to be successful, and in fact reached new heights, after Anzalone left for the Lowell Lock Monsters and was replaced by Scott Gordon. However, by the early 2000s, the novelty of hockey in the Roanoke Civic Center had worn off and the team's inability to advance deep into the playoffs led to a frustrated fanbase and sagging attendance. Turmoil in management and ownership contributed to bad press for the team and less effective marketing than in the team's early years. The Express folded after the 2003-2004 season. Afterward In 2005, Roanoke tried to field another hockey team, this time in the UHL: the Roanoke Valley Vipers. This team folded after just one season. Then, in 2016, the Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs formed in the SPHL. The Dawgs have made numerous references to the Express, including retiring the number of Terence Tootoo, who had committed suicide not long after his sole season in Roanoke. The Berglund Center tried to keep hockey alive in Roanoke by hosting Virginia Tech's games, as well as through an annual \\"Guns 'n' Hoses\\" game to benefit the MDA, in which area firefighters would go up against area law enforcement. In the late 2000s, the \\"Roanoke Express\\" name was revived for a youth hockey team. It was eventually absorbed into the Dawgs' youth team.

He was one of the first to develop theories on acid-base chemistry. Life After learning pharmacy in his native town he became a pupil of Christophe Glaser in Paris, and then went to Montpellier, where he began to lecture on chemistry. He next established a pharmacy in Paris, still continuing his lectures, but following 1683, being a Calvinist, he was obliged to retire to England. In the following year he returned to France, and turning Catholic in 1686 was able to reopen his shop and resume his lectures. He died in Paris on 19 June 1715. Lemery did not concern himself much with theoretical speculations, but holding chemistry to be a demonstrative science, confined himself to the straightforward exposition of facts and experiments. In consequence, his lecture-room was thronged with people of all sorts, anxious to hear a man who shunned the barren obscurities of the alchemists, and did not regard the quest of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life as the sole end of his science. Of his Cours de chymie (1675) he lived to see 13 editions, and for a century it maintained its reputation as a standard work. In 1680, using the corpuscular theory as a basis, Lemery stipulated that the acidity of any substance consisted in its pointed particles, while alkalis were endowed with pores of various sizes.Lemery, Nicolas. (1680). An Appendix to a Course of Chymistry. London, pp. 14‚Äì15. A molecule, according to this view, consisted of corpuscles united through a geometric locking of points and pores. Mock-up of Nicolas Lemery's 1680 acid-base bonding model. Illustration of laboratory apparatus, Cours de chymie, 1683 Cours de chymie in EnglishHis other publications included Pharmacop√©e universelle (1697), Trait√© universel des drogues simples (1698), Trait√© de l'antimoine (1707), together with a number of papers contributed to the French Academy, one of which offered a chemical and physical explanation of underground fires, earthquakes, lightning and thunder. He discovered that heat is evolved when iron filings and sulfur are rubbed together to a paste with water, and the artificial volcan de Lemery was produced by burying underground a considerable quantity of this mixture, which he regarded as a potent agent in the causation of volcanic action. His son Louis L√©mery (1677‚Äì1743) was appointed physician at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris in 1710, and became demonstrator of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi in 1731. He was the author of a Trait√© des aliments (1702), and of a Dissertation sur la nature des os (1704), as well as of a number of papers on chemical topics.

An optical molasses consists of 3 pairs of counter-propagating circularly polarized laser beams intersecting in the region where the atoms are present. The main difference between optical molasses and a MOT is the absence of magnetic field in the former. Therefore, unlike a MOT, an optical molasses provides only cooling and no trapping. While a typical Sodium MOT can cool atoms down to 300ŒºK, optical molasses can cool the atoms down to 40ŒºK, an order of magnitude colder. History When laser cooling was proposed in 1975, a theoretical limit on the lowest possible temperature was predicted. Known as the Doppler limit, T_d= \\\\hbar \\\\Gamma / {2 k_b} , this was given by the lowest possible temperature attainable considering the cooling of two- level atoms by Doppler cooling and the heating of atoms due to momentum diffusion from the scattering of laser photons. Here, \\\\Gamma , is the natural line-width of the atomic transition, \\\\hbar , is the reduced Planck's constant and, k_b , is Boltzmann's constant. Experiments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, found the temperature of cooled atoms to be well below the theoretical limit. Initially, it was a surprise to theorists, until the full explanation came out. Theory The best explanation of the phenomenon of optical molasses is based on the principle of polarization gradient cooling. Counterpropagating beams of circularly polarized light cause a standing wave, where the light polarization is linear but the direction rotates along the direction of the beams at a very fast rate. Atoms moving in the spatially varying linear polarisation have a higher probability density of being in a state that is more susceptible to absorption of light from the beam coming head-on, rather than the beam from behind. This results in a velocity dependent damping force that is able to reduce the velocity of a cloud of atoms to near the recoil limit.

It broadcasts on Freesat channel 692, Freeview HD channel 264, Sky channel 581, and the Roku box and is also available online. The channel is based in Spain, with a small studio and office in England. History Howard Conder (an ex-Jehovah's Witness) and his wife Lesley began the TV station in 2003 by forming a private company and remortgaging their home to put their own money into it. Between 2004 and 2014, the station was censured five times by Ofcom, for homophobic comments made on air, and for graphic depiction of aborted fetuses in an item aired before a children's programme. In a 2007 interview with The Guardian, Howard Conder said that the regulator Ofcom had received complaints from viewers about the channel's views of homosexuality.\\"The show is like a coffee morning in slow motion\\". Guardian Newspaper. Retrieved on 2009-05-08.

Peters is an outspoken critic of the Word of Faith movement and, during the interview, mentioned several prominent proponents of this doctrine by name such as Benny Hinn, Creflo Dollar and Kenneth Copeland. The programme was taken off-air before its scheduled end time, due to concerns that making accusations against specific individuals who were not present breached Ofcom rules on fairness. Lesley Conder criticised Peters the following morning, but the incident was widely discussed online. On 1 December 2011 evangelist and preacher Jacob Prasch announced on his website that he had left Revelation TV after the channel began broadcasting a weekly Jesse Duplantis show. Prasch accused Duplantis of being a heterodox preacher of the Word of Faith doctrine. Presenter Bob Mitchell subsequently also left,STATEMENT FROM BOB MITCHELL REGARDING REVELATION TV. and Prophetic Witness Movement International also pulled out of the station. The channel moved to Spain in 2010. As of 2012, Revelation TV had a permanent television studio base in Spain. An underground car park space was converted into a new television studio, from which several programmes are now transmitted. In November 2014 the Charity Commission for England and Wales said that Revelation TV was under investigation, after it identified regulatory concerns about trustees' benefits, conflicts of interest and a \\"potential significant loss of charitable funds\\". The Revelation Foundation said it welcomed the inquiry and would cooperate fully with proceedings. On 16 June 2015, the channel released a statement which said that the Charity Commission had identified no loss or misappropriation of charitable funds by the trustees. From around early 2015, fundraising commenced for the purchase of land and the building of a new purpose built television studio complex for the channel in Spain, as their current studio facilities, located in an underground car park space was deemed unfit for purpose, due to the lack of studio space, office space and restrictions imposed on them by their landlord. By March 2019, the land was bought, and construction of the new television studio and complex nearing completion with final fitting out work being completed to install cameras, sound and other equipment. The new complex is expected to house three new studios, one of which will be a dedicated music studio. The full completion of the new studio complex was expected to be made by the end of 2019 or early 2020. British politician Nigel Farage was interviewed on Revelation TV in November 2019. He talked about \\"globalists\\" and a \\"new world order\\". =Genesis TV= Another channel, Genesis TV, was formerly broadcast on Sky channel 592. It used to play much of the same content from RMusicTV, and a music show, The One to One Show, produced and hosted by presenter Michael Owusu. In February 2010 a Genesis TV presenter read off a message from a prankster who called himself 'Repmykipz', which claimed to be a story of salvation, but was merely an adaptation of the theme song of the American sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The presenter then went to another message from the same person consisting of the plot of \\"Star Wars\\". A posting of the prank on YouTube went viral and as of 2015 had been viewed over one million times. On 22 March 2010, Genesis TV allowed a debate between the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin and the leader of the Christian Party, George Hargreaves, as the two were competing against each other for the Barking constituency in the 2010 General election. Genesis TV was closed down and merged with Revelation TV on 1 April 2010. Revelation TV later moved to Sky channel 581 after the slot was given up by GOD TV. On 10 March 2010, the station announced that Genesis TV and Revelation TV would be merging into a single channel, to be called Revelation TV, with effect from 1 April 2010.

On May 17, 1968, they went to the draft board in Catonsville, Maryland, Catonsville draft board,, 2nd floor at the Knights of Columbus took 378 draft files, brought them to the parking lot in wire baskets, dumped them out, poured over them homemade napalm (an incendiary used extensively by the US military in Vietnam), and set them on fire.There exists news footage of this action, shot by Baltimore's WBAL-TV. List of the Nine The Nine were: *Father Philip Berrigan, a Josephite priest *Father Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest *Br. David Darst, a De La Salle Christian Brother *John Hogan *Tom Lewis, an artist *Marjorie Bradford Melville, a former Maryknoll sister *Thomas Melville, a former Maryknoll priest *George Mische *Mary Moylan History George Mische and Father Phil Berrigan were prime organizers of the Catonsville Nine. The organizing process was very democratic, with interminable meetings and \\"who's in, who's out\\" handraisings. =1967 Custom House raid= On October 17, 1967, Fr. Philip Berrigan and Tom Lewis raided the Baltimore City Custom House and poured blood on draft records as part of \\"The Baltimore Four\\" (with David Eberhardt and James Mengel) and were out on bail when they burned the records at Catonsville. (The first documented action against draft files is reputed to have been by Barry Bondhus in Minnesota, who, along with other family members, carried human waste into a draft board and defaced draft records.) =1968 Catonsville incident= On May 17, 1968, the Nine went to the Catonsville office of the Selective Service System located at the Knights of Columbus building on Frederick Road. The group entered the second floor office of the SSS and proceeded to throw hundreds of draft records into wire bins. One SSS employee, Mary Murphy, attempted to save the draft records but was restrained by one of the Nine. After collecting the records, the Nine set fire to the records with homemade napalm in the parking lot of the building. While the records were ablaze, the Nine recited the Lord's Prayer and explained their reasoning for protesting the War in Vietnam. In the end, 378 draft records were destroyed by fire; it is unknown whether or not the destruction of these files saved any lives of young men being drafted into the Vietnam War. Five Baltimore County police officers arrested the nine on site. While they were in jail, the group sent an apologetic letter and a basket of flowers to the one clerk, Mary Murphy, who was restrained during the event. The Catonsville Nine were tried in federal court October 5‚Äì9, 1968. The lead defense attorney was counterculture legal icon William Kunstler. They were found guilty of destruction of U.S. property, destruction of Selective Service files, and interference with the Selective Service Act of 1967. They were also sentenced to a total of 18 years' jail time and a fine of $22,000. Several of the nine‚ÄîMary Moylan, Phil Berrigan, Dan Berrigan and George Mische‚Äîwent \\"underground\\" when it came time to show up for prison‚Äîin other words, the FBI had to try to find them. Father Dan Berrigan caused considerable embarrassment to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover by popping up and giving sermons and then fading back into the \\"underground\\". Fr. Daniel Berrigan wrote, of the Catonsville incident: \\"Our apologies, good friends, for the fracture of good order, the burning of paper instead of children...\\" The whole of his statement is in The Trial of the Catonsville Nine. Large demonstrations occurred outside the Federal Courthouse on Calvert Street during the trial. The trial came soon after the events of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where considerable violence took place. The Nine's trial, with religious people involved, made the overall peace movement a bit harder to dismiss since protesters in Chicago consisted of younger, student and SDS, and the Weather Underground. Both the judge, Roszel C. Thomsen, and the prosecutor, Stephen H. Sachs, realized the historic proportions of the event but allowed little leeway to the defendants' arguments. In these early trials of such actions the government always overcharged and always tried to keep the trials to \\"nothing but the facts\\", i.e., did the Nine destroy files or did they not? The Nine, on the other hand, often referred to a higher law that they were following‚ÄîGod's moral law‚Äîas well as such precedents as the Nuremberg war crimes trials after World War II. They called several expert witnesses. At one point, prosecutor Sachs quipped that \\"the government is not a balloon attached to the consciences of the Nine.\\" Aftermath Tom Lewis had been sentenced to six years for a prior protest one week after Catonsville, and had three and a half years added to be served concurrently.Dowty, Morgan. \\"Incendiary Etchings: Tom Lewis and the Catonsville Nine\\", Art in Print, Vol. 7 No. 3 (September‚ÄìOctober 2017). Fr. Daniel Berrigan was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison to begin on April 9, 1970. According to Anke Wessels, director of Cornell's Center for Religion, Ethics, and Social Policy, \\"On the very day he was scheduled to begin his prison term, he left his office keys on a secretary's desk in Anabel Taylor Hall and disappeared.\\" Cornell marked Berrigan's impending imprisonment by conducting a weekend-long \\"America Is Hard to Find\\" event April 17-19, 1970, which included a public appearance by the then-fugitive Berrigan before a crowd of 15,000 in Barton Hall. On August 11, 1970, the FBI found and arrested Berrigan at the home of William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne. He was released from prison in 1972. Lewis was released in 1971. The \\"Nine\\" inspired many other anti-draft and anti-military actions in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Milwaukee 14, D.C. 9, Silver Spring 3, Chicago 8, Harrisburg 7, Camden 28. Participants sometimes remained at the scene to be arrested, sometimes they departed in order to avoid arrest. It is unknown how many persons were not drafted because of these actions. the movement had morphed into a continuing movement with an emphasis on nuclear weapons.

He wrote accompanying text and the cover was printed by fellow Catholic activist Corita Kent. The etchings depict the psychic torment of his fellow prisoners by suicidal thoughts, boredom or isolation, as well as scenes of police brutality.

He was the son of Baha' al-Dawla.  Biography  In 1012 Jalal Al-Dawla's father died. His brother, Sultan al-Dawla came to the throne and appointed him as governor of Basra. He ruled there up until Musharrif al-Dawla, who had taken control of Iraq, died in 1025. His death caused a succession crisis. Jalal al-Dawla, with the aid of his vizier Abu Sa'd Abd al-Wahid, tried to capture Baghdad, but was shortly repelled by a Buyid army which had taken control of Baghdad. Jalal al- Dawla then had Abu Sa'd imprisoned, and appointed the latter's cousin Abu Ali Hasan as his vizier. The army took more than two years before choosing Jalal al-Dawla as his successor in June 1027. He subsequently became involved in a bitter fight with his nephew Abu Kalijar, who controlled Fars and Kerman. Abu Kalijar shortly managed to seize Basra from him. In 1030, Jalal al-Dawla sent a fleet of 1300 ships under his vizier Abu Ali Hasan to capture Basra, but the expedition was a disaster and ended in a complete defeat. Abu Ali Hasan was then taken prisoner, but was soon released. He died the following year in Ahvaz in a family conflict. Jalal al-Dawla then appointed the latter's elder brother Abu'l-Qasim Hibatallah as his vizier. Jalal al-Dawla and Abu Kalijar were not always enemies; for example, Jalal al-Dawla provided support to Abu Kalijar when the Ghaznavids invaded Kerman in 1033. Jalal al-Dawla was however also forced to deal with problems in his own realm, which consisted of little more than Baghdad and Wasit following Abu Kalijar's seizure of Basra. His army was continually hostile, a situation which devolved to the point where the Abbasid caliph often acted as a mediator between the amir and his troops. A mutiny led by a Turk named Barstoghan in 1036 or 1037 was therefore not surprising. The revolt provided Abu Kalijar with an opportunity to invade. He failed to take Baghdad, but gained Jalal al-Dawla's allegiance. The latter, however, had the support of the Uqailid amir of Mosul and the Arab tribe of the Asadids, and he was soon restored to his full power as an independent ruler. Jalal al-Dawla's vizier Abu'l-Qasim Hibatallah was choked to death in 1038. He continued his rule in Iraq until his death in 1044, following which Abu Kalijar managed to gain control of Iraq, and expel Jalal al-Dawla's son and heir Al-Malik al-Aziz. A daughter of Jalal al-Dawla was married to Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo.

The story won a Locus Award. The story is also used for a specimen of analysis by Stephen King in Danse Macabre.

In the story's introduction, Ellison states that the story is neither for nor against abortion, but rather a promotion of personal responsibility (he goes on to say that after writing the story he had a vasectomy). The story is character driven, focusing on Gabe's growth beyond the pleasures of sex and casual relationships to embracing fatherhood and maturity. The critic Joseph Patrouch comments that the theme of searching for the responsibilities and maturity of fatherhood present in this story complements the recurring theme of searching for a father figure that is present in much of Ellison's work.Porter, Andrew (editor)(1978). The Book of Ellison. ALGOL Press, p62-63. Patrouch also comments that the structure of the story highlights the emphasis on character over actions. Three distinct flashbacks are used at different moments in the narration in order to further develop the character of Gabe. The development of the plot is governed by Gabe's growth rather than external events. The non-linear narrative structure of \\"Croatoan\\" is typical of Ellison's style, and is a feature of many of his most famous stories.

It is the only living member of its genus, Petromus, and family, Petromuridae. The name \\"dassie\\" means \\"hyrax\\" in Afrikaans,dassie rats are not to be confused with Cape hyraxes, which are also called dassies and are not rodents. and the two animals are found in similar habitats. Petromus means \\"rock mouse\\" and dassie rats are one of many rodents sometimes called rock rats. The family and genus names are sometimes misspelled as Petromyidae and Petromys.  Characteristics  Dassie rats are squirrel-like in appearance. Their tails are hairy, but not bushy whereas the soles of their feet are distinctly bare and have pads. Their heads are noticeably flattened. The overall coloration can be a range of browns, greys, or almost black. The nose is yellowish and tends to stand out. They have no underfur. The teats are located on the sides of the torso, which allows the young to feed from the side when crammed in a narrow rock crevice.  Natural history  Dassie rats are restricted to rocky outcrops in Namibia, parts of Angola, and northwest South Africa. They are famous for being able to squeeze into extremely narrow crevices. This is accomplished due to their flattened skulls and flexible ribs. Dassie rats feed primarily on grasses, but will sometimes eat fruits, seeds, and leaves. They have high crowned and rooted cheek teeth. Females give birth to a pair of offspring just once a year, an unusually slow reproductive rate among rodents.  Relatives  Dassie rats are the only remaining members of a once-diverse family that first appeared in the Oligocene of Africa. Both morphological and molecular studies suggest the closest living relatives to the dassie rats are the African cane rats in the family Thryonomyidae. These two families, along with related fossil families such as ‚Ä†Phiomyidae, represented an important early radiation of rodents in Africa.  References  Further reading  *Kingdon, J. 1997.

Little is known of their engine other than from the somewhat unclear description accompanying the patent, which was granted in 1830. Its main castings were made at the Morley Park foundry near Heage, and it weighed 7 tons and generated 35 horsepower at a head of 96 feet of water. Stephen Glover, in his gazetteer of Derbyshire, was enthusiastic about the prospects for the disc engine, foreseeing its use in all manner of applications, domestic as well as industrial, not only as a prime mover but also as a pump. He stated that John Dakeyne had also commissioned a disc engine to drive the bellows of an organ in the family's residence, Knabb House. A larger model was constructed to drain lead mines at Alport near Youlgreave and many steam versions were subsequently built by other people. The machine itself is difficult to describe. Frank Nixon, in his book \\"The Industrial Archaeology of Derbyshire\\" (1969), commented that: > The most striking characteristic of this ingenious machine is perhaps the > difficulty experienced by those trying to describe it; the patentees & > Stephen Glover only succeeded in producing descriptions of monumental > incomprehensibility.

He wrote the collection in three days in the window of a bookstore. \\"From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet\\" appeared in the October 1976 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, where its genesis is explained in some detail in the afterword. It was reprinted as part of the Ellison collection Strange Wine and then adapted into comic book form by Larry Todd and published by Last Gasp.  Background  The last of ten story titles Ellison had kept on his desk for years, \\"The Chocolate Alphabet\\" was used (and expanded to its present title) when Ellison wrote the story in the window of a Los Angeles science fiction bookshop, A Change of Hobbit. The story was sparked by a painting by underground cartoonist Larry Todd entitled 2 Nemotropin, which Ellison saw in 1974, and around which he promised to write an eight-page comic story illustrated by Todd, and published by \\"San Francisco underground comix magnate Ron Turner\\" and his company Last Gasp Eco-Funnies. Flash-forward to February 1976. Ellison began a week-long stint literally in the front window of A Change of Hobbit, writing a complete story each day for six days as a fund-raiser. (This was the first in a long series of such stunts for other bookstores and in other locations, although Ellison had written short stories to order earlier, notably \\"O Ye of Little Faith\\" at the 1965 Westercon in Long Beach, California, to three words ‚Äî \\"serape\\", \\"polyp\\", and \\"minotaur\\" ‚Äî provided at an auction by the winning bidder, Larry Niven, whose last name is that of the story's protagonist.) On Monday, February 23, 1976, Ellison wrote the 3000-word story, \\"Strange Wine,\\" subsequently reprinted (along with other stories written the same week) in his 1978 collection of the same name.Ellison, Harlan. Strange Wine: Fifteen New Stories from the Nightside of the World (Harper & Row, 1978). On Tuesday, realizing that he could not write an eight-page story for the comic based on Todd's painting, he resolved to write 26 short-short stories, some as brief as one sentence, as a pastiche of Fredric Brown, the master of such brief stories. From A to Z, in The Chocolate Alphabet was begun that day and, after writing into the wee hours, was finished on Wednesday, February 25, 1976, at around 1:30 p.m. The comic book version, Harlan Ellison's Chocolate Alphabet, with cover and art by Larry Todd, appeared in 1978, published by Last Gasp.Ellison, Harlan and Larry Todd. From A to Z in the Chocolate Alphabet (Last Gasp, August 1978).  Sequel  Ellison wrote a sort of sequel to this entitled, \\"From A to Z, in the Sarsaparilla Alphabet,\\" on November 10, 1990, at the bookstore Dangerous Visions in Sherman Oaks, California, beginning it in the window and then inside the store with his manual typewriter and completing it after health issues, which interrupted the writing, were addressed. Although a few people had seen it‚Äîphotocopies were given to those who purchased over $50 worth of books while the story was being written‚Äîthe story sat unpublished for nearly ten years, because Ellison, highly prolific at the time, had forgotten about marketing it (and even forgot to include it in his latest collection, Slippage). After \\"From A to Z, in the Sarsaparilla Alphabet\\" was published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 2001, it was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award. And because the 26 short-short stories in this novelette deal with gods and demons, it was subsequently collected in the expanded version of Deathbird Stories, published in 2011 by Subterranean Press.Ellison, Harlan.

This led the Founding Fathers of the United States to make an establishment of a continental national mint, a main priority after the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. The Coinage Act of 1792 was entered into law on April 2. It proclaimed the creation of the United States Mint. Philadelphia at that time was the nation's capital; therefore the first mint facility was built there. The Coinage Act of 1792 also instituted a decimal system based on a dollar unit; specified weights, metallic composition and fineness; and required each United States coin feature \\"an impression emblematic of liberty\\". HistoryFirst building (1792‚Äì1833)= First Philadelphia Mint (1792, demolished) David Rittenhouse, an American scientist, was appointed the first director of the mint by President George Washington. Two lots were purchased by Rittenhouse on July 18, 1792, at Seventh Street and 631 Filbert Street in Philadelphia for $4,266.67. The next day, demolition of an abandoned whiskey distillery on the property began. Foundation work began on July 31, and by September 7, the first building was ready for installation of the smelting furnace. The smelt house was the first public building erected by the United States government. A three-story brick structure facing Seventh Street was constructed a few months later. Measuring nearly wide on the street, it only extended back . The gold and silver for the mint were contained in basement vaults. The first floor housed deposit and weighing rooms, along with the press room, where striking coins took place. Mint official offices were on the second floor, and the assay office was located on the third floor. A photograph of the Seventh Street building taken around 1908 show that by then, the year 1792 and the words \\"Ye Olde Mint\\" (in quotes) had been painted onto the facade. Between the smelt house and the building on Seventh Street, a mill house was built. Horses in the basement turned a rolling mill located on the first floor. In January 1816, the smelt and mill houses were destroyed by a fire. The smelt house was never repaired and all smelting was done elsewhere. The mill house, which was completely destroyed, was soon replaced with a large brick building. It included a new steam engine in the basement to power the machinery. Until 1833, these three buildings provided the United States with hard currency. Operations moved to the second Philadelphia mint in 1833, and the land housing the first mint was sold. In the late 19th or early 20th century, the property was sold to Frank Stewart, who approached the city, asking them to preserve or relocate the historic buildings. With no governmental help, the first mint was demolished between 1907 and 1911. Now, only a small plaque remains to memorialize the spot. =Second building (1833‚Äì1901)= Second Philadelphia Mint (1833, demolished) On July 4, 1829, a cornerstone was laid for the building at the intersection of Chestnut and Juniper Streets. It was designed by William Strickland. The second Philadelphia Mint, the \\"Grecian Temple\\", was constructed of white marble with classic Greek-style columns on front and back. Measuring wide in front by deep, it was a huge improvement over the first facility, in space as well as image. Opening in January 1833, its production was constrained by the outdated machinery salvaged from the first mint. Franklin Peale was sent to Europe to study advanced coinmaking technologies which were brought back and implemented, increasing productivity and quality. Sold in 1902, the second mint was quickly demolished. The cornerstone buried in 1829 was unearthed and contained a candy jar with a petrified cork stoppering it. Inside the jar were three coins, a few newspapers, and a scroll with information on the first mint and the creation of the second. The site has been occupied since 1914 by the 19-story Widener Building, 1339 Chestnut Street. =Third building (1901‚Äì1969)= Third Philadelphia Mint (1901). Now Community College of Philadelphia. The third Philadelphia Mint was built at 1700 Spring Garden Street and opened in 1901. It was designed by William Martin Aiken, Architect for the Treasury, but it was constructed under James Knox Taylor. It was a block from the United States Smelting Company that was at Broad and Spring Garden Streets. In one year alone, the mint produced 501 million coins (5/7 of the U.S. currency minted), as well as 90 million coins for foreign countries.Third Philadelphia Mint (1901-1969) - workshopoftheworld.com - Retrieved August 31, 2008 A massive structure nearly a full city block, it was an instant landmark, characterized by a Roman temple facade. Visitors enjoyed seven themed glass mosaics designed by Louis C. Tiffany in a gold- backed vaulted ceiling. The mosaics depicted ancient Roman coinmaking methods. This mint still stands intact, and much of the interior is intact, as well. It was acquired by the Community College of Philadelphia in 1973. A tribute page has been created. =Fourth and current building (1969‚Äìpresent)= The modern Philadelphia Mint (1969) Two blocks from the site of the first mint, the fourth and current Philadelphia Mint opened its doors in 1969. It was designed by Philadelphia architect Vincent G. Kling, who would also help design Five Penn Center, Centre Square, and the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts.Vincent Kling - Ed Bacon Foundation - Retrieved August 31, 2008 It was the world's largest mint when it was built and held that distinction as of October 2017. The Philadelphia Mint can produce up to one million coins in 30 minutes.http://www.us-coin-values-advisor.com/us-philadelphia- mint.html#Todays%20Philadelphia%20Mint It took three years for the original mint to produce that many. The mint also produces medals and awards for military, governmental, and civil services. Engraving of all dies and strikers only occurs here. Uncirculated coins minted here have the \\"P\\" mint mark, while circulated coins from before 1980 carried no mint mark except the Jefferson nickels minted from 1942‚Äì1945 and the 1979 Susan B. Anthony dollar coins. Since 1980, all coins minted there have the \\"P\\" mint mark except cents (although 2017 cents do have the \\"P\\" mint mark). Tours can be taken where all stages of minting are explained, along with displays of past equipment. This takes place via an enclosed catwalk above the minting facility itself. Various video stations are placed along the tour route, where visitors can push buttons to watch videos about various stages of the minting process. Most of those videos were narrated by Baseball Hall of Fame announcer for the Philadelphia Phillies (and voice of NFL Films), Harry Kalas.Radio Hall of Fame entry for Kalas Retrieved 2012-03-15 Thefts On August 19, 1858, two well- dressed thieves on a tour of the mint used a counterfeit key to open a display case. They made off with $265.00 in gold pieces, but due to the rarity of the coins, the men were quickly apprehended while trying to spend them in local shops. In 1893, Henry S. Cochran, a weighing clerk, was found to have embezzled $134,000 in gold bars from the mint vault over a period of 8‚Äì10 years. A total of $107,000 was recovered from his home and from a cache in the ventilation system inside the mint. About 445,000 double eagle coins were minted in 1933, but only one was ever legally released. King Farouk of Egypt contacted Nellie Tayloe Ross, then Director of the U.S. Mint, and requested one 1933 double eagle for his extensive coin collection. Since the 1933 coins were not circulated, she took one coin to the Smithsonian Institution and received documentation of its rarity. She then issued an export document allowing the Egyptian king to receive his coin. After the deaths of Farouk and the general who inherited the king's collection, the coin disappeared into a European collector's possession. It resurfaced when Stephen Fenton acquired it. When he tried to auction it off, both he and the auctioneer were arrested and the coin was seized. It was placed in the vault of the Secret Service in their office in the World Trade Center. While the provenance and paperwork proving ownership was debated ad nauseam in the courts, the coin was transferred to Fort Knox for further safekeeping. The World Trade Center was attacked and destroyed later that year. An agreement was reached between the U.S. Government and Stephen Fenton. The Fenton Farouk, as it came to be called, was sold at auction for $7.9 million in 2002 with a 10% auctioneer's premium and $20 to \\"monetize\\" the coin. Fenton and the government split the proceeds of the auction, with the provision that any further 1933 double eagles would be seized and not auctioned. In 2003, a Philadelphia woman named Joan Switt Langbord found ten 1933 double eagles in a safe deposit box that once belonged to her parents; when she took them to be appraised, they were seized by the United States Treasury as stolen property. Investigators claimed that Langbord's father, Israel Switt, conspired with a clerk inside the mint to steal the coins. He had been investigated previously for the crime, leading to the confiscation of several gold pieces, but the statute of limitations had prevented him from being prosecuted. Langbord sued to have the coins returned to her, but in July 2011, a federal jury ruled the stolen coins were property of the U.S. government. In September 2011, former mint officer William Gray pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing error coins valued at $2.4 million and selling them to a distributor.

It was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1977, then was included in DAW's The 1978 Annual World's Best SF in 1978 and Ellison's short story collection Shatterday two years later. According to Ellison, it was partially inspired by a fragment of conversation that he misheard at a party at the home of actor Walter Koenig: \\"How is Jeff?\\" \\"Jeff is fine. He's always fine,\\" which he perceived as \\"Jeff is five, he's always five.\\" Additionally, Ellison based the character of Jeffty on Joshua Andrew Koenig, Walter's son. He declared: Plot Jeffty is a boy who never grows past the age of five ‚Äî physically, mentally, or chronologically. The narrator, Jeffty's friend from the age of five well into adulthood, discovers that Jeffty's radio plays all-new episodes of long-canceled serial programs, broadcast on radio stations that no longer exist. He can buy all-new issues of long-discontinued comic books such as The Shadow and Doc Savage, and of long- discontinued pulp magazines with all-new stories by long-dead authors like Stanley G. Weinbaum, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert E. Howard. Jeffty can even watch films that are adaptations of old pulp fiction novels like Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. The narrator is privy to this world because of Jeffty's trust, while the rest of the world (the world that got older as Jeffty did not) is not. While waiting in line at the local movie house, Jeffty borrows a portable radio. He tunes in a radio show from the past. The other children, upset that they cannot return the radio to the broadcast of a ball game, beat him badly. Once returned to his home, Jeffty‚Äôs mother drowns him in the bathtub.

Johnston, known as DJ to hundreds of thousands of viewers and colleagues, presented his last bulletin on the Seven Network on 23 September 2005. He and wife Eve retired in a property at Bendigo to enjoy country life and be close to their daughter, her husband and their grandchildren.  Early life and education  After emigrating from Wales as an 11-year-old with his mother Lillian in 1953, David Johnston settled in Victoria's western districts and later started his secondary education at Terang High School. But his mother soon moved them to Olinda to start a children's holiday home and when that venture failed financially, David had to leave school aged 15 to earn some money. He did various jobs, including working in a nursery and in the middle of it all David realised he wanted to be on radio. With his mother's help, David found the Bill Roberts Radio School in Melbourne known as \\"The Vincent School of Broadcasting\\" and made the journey, sometimes hitchhiking, from Olinda to Ferntree Gully to catch the train into the city. The radio school regularly sent student tapes to radio stations around the country. David's was one voice on an audition tape sent to 2RG in Griffith, New South Wales and at 17 he secured his first professional radio gig. David spent three years at 2RG and it was in Griffith that he met his future wife, Eve, to whom he later had two daughters, Georgie (born 1971) and Romy (born 1973). David enjoyed riding his small motor-scooter around the streets of Griffith and hanging out with fellow announcers John Knox, Graham Miles and Peter Churchley, all of whom went on to have long careers in radio in Brisbane, Melbourne and the Sunshine Coast.  Radio and television career  In 1962 Johnston had a 15-month stint with 4KQ in Brisbane before returning to Melbourne as a general announcer and news presenter on 3DB. Nearly 12 months down the track, HSV7 was looking for someone to present the late-night news and Dan Webb suggested Johnston at 3DB, who showed promise. His first major bulletin was announcing the death of US President John F. Kennedy.Headline act ‚Äì TV & Radio ‚Äì theage.com.au Johnston split his time between the closely aligned 3DB and the Seven Network in Melbourne until 1967, when he was appointed full-time news reporter and presenter. On 22 June 1972 he hosted, with Lucy Kiraly, the first Tattslotto draw on Melbourne television. Johnston held that role for the next ten years before shocking many people by leaving television to run a news agency in Elsternwick. In 1980, he returned to television to presented the prime time Eyewtiness News on ATV-10 with Jana Wendt and latterly, Jo Pearson. His successful partnerships with both anchors helped make Eyewitness News the leading nightly news bulletin in Melbourne throughout the 1980s. David stayed in this role until returning to the Seven Network in 1996 to become the weekday anchor of Seven Nightly News in Melbourne. He presented this bulletin solo from 1996 until mid-1999, when he became a co-anchor with Anne Fulwood. Johnston became a relief anchor a year later but returned full-time in 2003 to anchor a national news bulletin, titled \\"Target Iraq\\", at 4.30 pm each weekday afternoon to cover the major story, and to summarise Australian news from Sydney. When the strike on Iraq ended, Seven decided it would keep the bulletin, with production moving to Melbourne and Johnston continuing at the helm until his retirement in 2005. Awards  He has won various awards, including a LogieAustralian Television: 1974‚Äì77 Logie Awards and two Penguin awards.

It opened in 1796 and closed 80 years later in 1876, after the only lock was damaged by flooding. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust purchased the Coombe Hill Canal nature reserve in 1985 and the area is managed by the trust. Adjacent to the Coombe Hill Canal is a large area of wet meadowland situated midway between Gloucester and Tewkesbury to the west of the A38, which was purchased by the trust in 1999. There is a north and a south meadow. This land and the Canal itself often flood in winter, which attracts hundreds of wildfowl. History The canal was authorised in 1792 and was probably open in 1796. The cost of construction was about ¬£5000 and the completed canal could take barges of 60-70 tons. It was meant to carry goods to Cheltenham but the local geography made that impossible. There was a gap of nearly five miles between the canal and the town, so the canal was not as useful as it might have been. In 1810 the canal was leased to a group of three men for ¬£400 per annum. In 1822 the canal was leased to a number of committeemen from the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. In 1829 they renewed their lease for another 21 years at ¬£500 per annum and in 1844 offered to buy the canal for ¬£8,750, but they later withdrew the offer. In 1849 the lease was taken up by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which was unable to make the canal pay, and when it surrendered the lease in 1867 cargo fell to 1,800 tons per annum. The Coombe Hill Canal company then asked the engineer of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal to provide a report. The report took the view that the canal could not be made profitable and it would be best turned into an oyster bed. Despite this the canal company tried to run the canal itself for a few years before selling it for ¬£520 in 1871. The canal was resold for ¬£1000 in 1873 but in 1876 it was abandoned due to the new owners being unable to afford to repair flood damage to the lock that connected it to the River Severn. SSSI Status In 1954 the canal and certain fenland and flood meadow areas were notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and renotified in 1995 for boundary alterations.Natural England SSSI information on the citationNatural England SSSI information on the Coombe Hill Canal unitsTewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation', Sites of Special Scientific Interest In 1999 the meadows around the middle of the canal were purchased by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, which is restoring the wetland. The meadows are on either side of the canal. The canal is the home of a number of rare and uncommon beetle species, and of two species of fly that have not been found anywhere else in the UK.

The trust has carried out management work with aid of Severn Trent Water and the then Nature Conservancy Council to restore the derelict canal. The area was severely flooded in the Gloucestershire Floods of 2007 and significant restoration work was necessary.\\"Donations help regenerate flood-hit nature reserve\\", This is Gloucestershire, 13 April 2009 =Coombe Hill Canal= The site is listed in the ‚ÄòTewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011‚Äô, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation',' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Tewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation', Key Wildlife Sites Fuller information for Coombe Hill Canal () is provided in the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. It is a site overall (standing water, canals, fen, marsh and swamp lowland). The clearance work has been beneficial to aquatic and bankside plants. Flourishing uncommon species include fine-leaved water-dropwort, common meadow-rue and cyperus sedge. Also recorded are purple-loosestrife, yellow iris and skullcap. The management of nettles preserves a colony of the parasitic greater dodder. There is grassland scrub on the towpath. strawberry clover, oxeye daisy and the Severn Vale speciality, corky-fruited water-dropwort, are present along the path. The scrub provides a habitat for breeding blackcap, whitethroat and willow warbler. Flocks of fieldfare and redwing are reported as feasting on hawthorn berries in winter. Large numbers of Eurasian teal, mallard, Eurasian wigeon and Bewick's swan, together with the occasional pintail, gadwall and goldeneye, are seen on the adjacent flood meadows. The site is important for beetles, particularly those associated with tufted hair-grass. A significant number of dragonfly and damselfly species are recorded. A series of open lagoons separated by dense reed beds has been created by selective dredging. Scrub-cutting on a rotational basis maintains habitat for breeding birds and, with clearance of the towpath, also keeps the Canal edges clear of tall vegetation. =Coombe Hill Meadows= The site is listed in the ‚ÄòTewkesbury Borough Local Plan to 2011‚Äô, adopted March 2006, Appendix 3 'Nature Conservation',' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS). Fuller information for Coombe Hill Meadows () is provided in the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. The north meadow part of the reserve is a site of wet grassland and drainage ditches. With the addition of the south meadow the full site (canal and meadows) is a reserve. Historically, management of the area included drainage with some of the meadows ploughed (reducing wildlife interest). Restoration work includes control of drainage to enhance the wildlife interest. Ditches have been restored by widening and re-profiling to improve their wildlife value. The rare true fox sedge may be found in some of the ditches. A number of clay bunds have been put in place. Their purpose is to hold back the water into late summer. Two large shallow pools, called scrapes, have been excavated in the meadows next to the canal as well as a smaller pond next to the public footpath. The 2007 Gloucestershire floods resulted in major remedial work as a result of the devastation caused.\\"Staff at nature reserve celebrate its revival\\", This is Gloucestershire, 30 July 2010 During the winter months the flooded meadows attract wintering wildfowl such as northern pintail, Eurasian teal and Eurasian wigeon, as well as Bewick's swan. As the floodwater recedes the bare mud around the ditches and scrapes, and the area of fen provide breeding and foraging habitat for waders such as common snipe. The hay meadows at the back of the reserve are ideal for Eurasian curlew nesting. In 2010 it is reported that Eurasian oystercatchers have bred for the first time, and six pairs of northern lapwing chicks have also been seen. The conservation programme aims to maintain a good wetland habitat which will benefit the important gatherings of birds, invertebrates and plants on the reserve. Conservation work includes hedgerow layering, pollarding of willows and cutting for hay.

It was intended as a continuation of a story by Robert Bloch, \\"A Toy for Juliette\\", which also appears in the anthology. Plot summary Jack the Ripper appears inexplicably in a sterile futuristic metropolis, where anyone is free to do what they want however arcane or immoral. He is brought before Juliette, a girl who is named after the Marquis de Sade's Juliette. Upon killing Juliette (much to the delight of a City denizen who is her grandfather), Jack the Ripper is returned to the London of his own time, where he commits another of his infamous killings. He is surprised to discover that there are other mental presences or personalities coexisting within his own mind, commenting on the brutality of his acts as if they were spectators at a theatrical performance or aesthetes critiquing a work of art in a museum. Although recognizably human in form, the future City's denizens have powers of matter manipulation, time travel, and telepathy. They can both read and manipulate Jack the Ripper's mind. They proceed for their own malign amusement to mentally expose him to his own subconscious lusts, desires, and petty hatreds; prior to their interference he had suppressed his awareness of these urges. He realizes that he had persuaded himself that his killings were purely moralistic in intent, meant to draw attention to the injustices, inequalities, social wretchedness, and debauchery of industrial Victorian society. To Jack's despair, his actual base motivations are fully revealed to him by the City's denizens, after which they delight in his ensuing psychological anguish. He is recalled to the City of the future by its inhabitants. Enraged, he kills one of his tormentors. Jack is fooled by the City denizens into believing that this murder has caused a breakdown in their society and that they have lost control of the City's functioning. He is implicitly led to believe that he has all the power and is an uncontrollable, random evil in their presence. He embarks on a killing spree to terrify the City's residents and punish them for their manipulation of him. After brutally murdering scores of City denizens in a veritable frenzy of bloodlust, Jack learns to his horror that the City denizens have only manipulated him again to sate their decadent desire for entertainment. The surviving denizens disarm him, leaving him to roam the City streets aimlessly. He cries aloud that he really is a \\"bad man\\", a man to be respected and feared rather than mocked and thrown aside.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . ) is the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis. It is a rare disease caused by excessive numbers of mast cells in the skin that produce hives or lesions on the skin when irritated.  Signs and symptoms  Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by excessive amounts of mast cells in the skin. Red or brown spots are often seen on the skin, typically around the chest, forehead, and back. These mast cells, when irritated (e.g. by rubbing the skin, heat exposure), produce too much histamine, triggering an allergic reaction that leads to hives localized to the area of irritation, sometimes referred to as Darier's sign. Severe itching usually follows, and scratching the area only serves to further symptoms. Symptoms can be mild (flushing and hives that require no treatment), moderate (diarrhea, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, headache, and fainting), or life-threatening (vascular collapse requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization).  Cause  The majority of urticaria pigmentosa cases are caused by a point mutation at amino acid 816 of the proto-oncogene c-kit. c-kit is a transmembrane protein which, when bound to Mast Cell Growth Factor (MCGF), signals the cell to divide. Mutations in position 816 of c-kit can result in a constant division signal being sent to the mast cells, resulting in abnormal proliferation. Different mutations have been linked to different onset times of the disease. For example, the Asp816Phe and Asp816Val mutations (the aspartate normally at position 816 in the c-kit protein has been replaced with phenylalanine or valine respectively) have been associated with early manifestation of the disease (mean age of onset: 1.3 and 5.9 months respectively). The c-kit gene is encoded on the q12 locus of chromosome 4.url=https://www.genecards.org/cgi- bin/carddisp.pl?gene=KIT&keywords;=C-kit = Irritants = Several factors can worsen the symptoms of urticaria pigmentosa: * Emotional stress * Physical stimuli such as heat, friction, and excessive exercise * Bacterial toxins * Venom * Eye drops containing dextran * NSAIDs * Alcohol * Morphine The classification of NSAIDs can be disputed. Aspirin, for example, causes the mast cells to degranulate, releasing histamines and causing symptoms to flare. However, daily intake of 81 mg aspirin may keep the mast cells degranulated. Thus, while symptoms may be worsened at first, they can get better as the mast cells are unable to recharge with histamine.  Diagnosis  Histopathology of urticaria pigmentosa, showing plenty of spindle shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm i.e. mast cells infiltrating the dermis and the appendiceal structures (black arrows). The basal cells show more pigmentation (blue arrows). The disease is most often diagnosed as an infant, when parents take their baby in for what appears to be bug bites. The bug bites are actually the clumps of mast cells. Doctors can confirm the presence of mast cells by rubbing the baby's skin. If hives appear, it most likely signifies the presence of urticaria pigmentosa.  Treatments  There are no permanent cures for urticaria pigmentosa. However, treatments are possible. Most treatments for mastocytosis can be used to treat urticaria pigmentosa. Many common anti-allergy medications are useful because they reduce the mast cell's ability to react to histamine. At least one clinical study suggested that nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, may reduce mast cell degranulation in patients with urticaria pigmentosa. A 1984 study by Fairly et al. included a patient with symptomatic urticaria pigmentosa who responded to nifedipine at dose of 10 mg po tid. However, nifedipine has never been approved by the FDA for treatment of urticaria pigmentosa. Another mast cell stabilizer Gastrocrom, a form of cromoglicic acid has also been used to reduce mast cell degranulation.  Epidemiology  Urticaria pigmentosa is a rare disease, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.

Rather than being a typical group adventure, The Gem and the Staff was designed for head-to-head tournament- style play, with players separately playing the same adventure and competing against each other for points earned by accomplishing certain goals. The adventure is only playable with one dungeon master (DM) and one player. Plot summary The Gem and the Staff is an adventure for a DM and a single player using a provided thief character. The player must search for a magic gem and a staff of power inside an evil wizard's tower. This module is divided into two separate adventures, which can be played as successive scenarios. The player takes the role of an experienced thief named Eric the Bold, who is pressed in both adventures into special thieving services. In the first adventure, Eric's task is to steal a certain gem from the trap-riddled tower of the wizard Tormag. The second adventure involves Tormag hiring Eric to steal a mighty magic wand from his arch-rival Felspel. Both modules are set with a time limit of thirty real-world minutes to complete the task. Publication history This adventure was originally published as Quest for the Fazzlewood in 1978 in a limited printing of twenty-six sheets with an outer folder and sold at WinterCon VII. The adventure was written by John and Laurie Van De Graaf, with art by Gregg DeCesare. This original module was a tournament scenario for a DM and one player with a thief character. Quest for the Fazzlewood was published by Metro Detroit Gamers, who also published Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. Quest for the Fazzlewood was used as a tournament module at Wintercon VII, and later publicly released. The module was later expanded and revised as O1 The Gem and the Staff. The Gem and the Staff was published by TSR in 1983 as two sixteen- page booklets with an outer folder, and included cardstock miniatures and nineteen illustrated maps for use by the player. The module contained viewed- from-above scale maps. Reception Chris Hunter reviewed the scenario for Imagine magazine. He felt that time was extremely tight and noted that none of his playtesters finished either of the two tasks inside the allotted 30 minutes. Hunter also thought that the provided scoring system does not do a good job in evaluating how well a player has done and suggested dungeon masters (DMs) devise their own. He also criticised a lack of information on whether doors are locked or not‚Äîof crucial importance in a scenario of this type, according to him. However, Hunter pointed out that \\"a lot of thought has gone into this module\\". He concluded by calling it an \\"excellent module\\" that he \\"highly recommended\\". Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 71. Swan called this an \\"extremely playable example\\" of TSR's One on One module line meant for only one player and one DM. Swan felt that \\"there are enough obstacles and encounters along the way to make it a real challenge\\". Swan listed the game's strict time limit of one hour, the ready-to use character sheet, and sixteen page map book among the aspects that make the module \\"a pleasure to play\\", although he concluded that because the adventure is only good for an hour of play, \\"replay value is virtually nil\\". He concluded by saying \\"The Gem and the Staff does an excellent job of filling a roleplaying niche by providing quality material for just two players ... but let's also hope that next time out we get a little more for our money.\\" Ken Rolston briefly reviewed The Gem and the Staff for Dragon magazine No. 135.

Earlier, during his playing career, Owens was a first baseman and catcher, and then a manager, in minor league baseball. Philadelphia Phillies Owens' entire Major League career was spent with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was the general manager and principal architect of the 1980 Phillies, who won the third National League (NL) pennant and became the first World Series champion in franchise history ‚Äî breaking a 97-year streak of futility dating to the team's founding in . Owens was general manager of the Phillies from June 3, , through the end of , and twice (1972; 1983‚Äì1984) added the title of field manager to his job description.

He served in the United States Army during World War II. Prior to 1951, Owens spent several years in the semiprofessional ranks with the Salamanca Merchants in what was then the Suburban League, the local Town Team Baseball circuit.Reader remembers Salamanca's Paul Owens. Olean Times Herald (November 30, 2015). Retrieved December 2, 2015. Owens' professional playing career began in 1951 at the relatively advanced age of 27. He played exclusively at the lower ends of the minor leagues, with his active career largely centered in his native western New York. A first baseman who batted and threw right-handed, he twice (1951 and 1957) batted .407 with the Olean Oilers of the Class D PONY League (now the New York‚ÄìPenn League) and set a league record by hitting safely in 38 consecutive games in 1951. During his relatively brief playing career, Owens compiled a lifetime average of .374. Managerial and front office career In 1955, Owens was named Olean's playing manager; the following year, the Oilers became a Phillies' affiliate and Owens moved into their organization. In 1958 and 1959, he managed Class C Bakersfield of the California League. In 1960 he became a scout, and, in , director of the entire Philadelphia farm system. On June 3, 1972, he replaced John Quinn as the Phillies' general manager. Then, five weeks later, on July 10, Owens fired manager Frank Lucchesi and assumed that job as well, to get a closer (if temporary) look at the last-place Phillies' on-field struggles. He then returned to the front office and proceeded to turn the Phils into pennant contenders within three seasons. His farm system, one of the most productive in the game at the time, bore fruit‚Äîyielding players such as Mike Schmidt, Greg Luzinski, Bob Boone, Larry Bowa and Dick Ruthven. In addition, Owens aggressively swung trades to add missing pieces such as relief pitcher Tug McGraw and outfielders Garry Maddox and Bake McBride. The Phils won the NL East in ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äîeach time falling short in the National League Championship Series. Owens thought he added the final piece in when he signed free agent Pete Rose, but the Phils stumbled and finished fourth. In 1980, under manager Dallas Green, the Phillies beat Houston in an intense NLCS and then defeated the Kansas City Royals for the team's first world championship. On July 18, , Owens again decided to don a uniform and run the Phillies from the dugout as well as from the front office. He fired manager Pat Corrales‚Äîeven though Philadelphia was in first place at the time, albeit just one game over .500‚Äîand led the club to 47 wins in 77 games. They then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games in the NLCS to win the Phillies' fourth pennant. During the World Series, the Phils lost to Baltimore in five games. Owens returned to managing in , but the results were disappointing. The Phillies played only .500 ball and finished fourth, 15¬Ω games behind the division champ Chicago Cubs. Owens was relieved of both his GM and managing jobs during the off-season, but remained with the Phillies as a senior advisor and special scout until his death, in 2003, at age 79 in Woodbury, New Jersey. For the 2004 season, the Phillies wore a patch on their right shoulder featuring a banner reading \\"Pope\\" in honor of Owens, and a shamrock in honor of former relief pitcher Tug McGraw, who had also died that winter. His career managing record was 161‚Äì158 (.505). Honors *Starting in 1986, the Phillies established the annual Paul Owens Award. This award is given each season to both the top pitcher and the top position player within the Phillies' minor-league system.

The official language of the island is English but Kreole, a form of French patois, remains an influential secondary language. The people are predominantly Catholic but the religious climate is tolerant. Festivals Saint Lucia holds every year two main traditional festivals, La Woz (\\"The Rose\\", on August 30) and La Magwit (\\"The Marguerite\\", on October 17), organized by the two rival historic cultural associations (societ√©s) with the same names whose affiliates comprise most of the country's population. The Christmas season is celebrated and a number of small festivals and parades take place throughout the island. Saint Lucia also celebrates a cultural festival known as Creole Day (Jounen Kw√©y√≤l). This is celebrated each year on the last Sunday of October. On the Sunday of this week, the various towns chosen to host this festival put out the result of their grand preparations; local foods and drinks such as breadfruit, green fig, plantain, salt fish, king fish, manicou (opossum), roast pork, Johnny Cake (fried bake) and a famous dish, bouyon (fish, chicken or meat stewed with dasheen, yams, plantains, banana and dumplings), lime drinks, guava drinks and more. Most people commemorate this day by wearing the island's national wear known as the Madras. Persons who do not want to wear the extreme layers of skirts and dresses make clothing out of the special plaid material. Secular observances include an internationally renowned Jazz Festival. Beginning in 1991, this annual festival draws crowds of music-lovers from around the world. Music The musical culture of Saint Lucia includes an indigenous folk music tradition, as well as other Caribbean music genres such as Calypso, soca, zouk and reggae. Saint Lucia produces very high quantities of zouk music. Modern Saint Lucia today has produced artists/producers such as Mecca, Mr Vegas, Sizzla, Anthony B, and Maxi Priest. Cuisine St Lucia's national dish is green banana and saltfish. The Island's Cuisine is a unique blend of West African, European (mainly British and French) and East Indian cuisine this creates dynamic meal dishes such as Macaroni pie, Stew chicken, rice and peas, hearty fish broths or fish water, hearty soups packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables. St Lucian cuisine is similar to many other commonwealth Caribbean nations such as Dominica, Jamaica Neighboring St Vincent and Trinidad. Typical essential food stuff are potatoes, onions, celery, thyme, coconut milk, the very hot scotch bonnet peppers, flour and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St Lucia meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over ground provisions or rice. Due to St Lucia's East Indian influenced by its small Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular. However, due to the blend of between cooking styles, curry dishes have a distant Caribbean twist to it. In recent years, roti, a flatbread of Indian origin, has become very popular being imported from the twin island nation of Trinidad and Tobago to the south. This bread is typically served as a fast food snack. The bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas, potatoes, or meat. Literature Derek Walcott is the most prominent St. Lucian writer, Nobel Prize winner in 1992. Art Dr The Honourable Bongskie Agno, renowned St. Lucian artist, was knighted in the 2009/2010 New Year's honours list, for his services to art. The investiture ceremony was held on 9 April 2010, at Government House where the Governor General on the advice of Her Majesty the Queen, invested Sir Dunstan St. Omer with the Insignia of a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). The UK Telegraph has described him as ‚Äúthe Michelangelo of the Caribbean‚Äù. Designer of the St Lucian flag. In 2007 the Folk Research Centre declared him a National Cultural Hero. Born in Castries, on October 24, 1927. Died, aged 87, on May 5, 2015. Sir Dunstan St Omer Carnival Traditionally, in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a carnival before Lent. In 1999, it was moved to mid-July so as not to clash with the much larger Trinidad and Tobago carnival, and in effort to attract more overseas visitors. It is a two-day festival where people walk about two miles. Before carnival, there is a competition among women in the country to be the queen of carnival of year. Sport Another popular sport in Saint Lucia is Football. Football played all over the island as well as cricket.

History WKST's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. The station originally signed on August 8, 1960 as WCAE-FM, co-owned with WCAE (AM) and WTAE-TV, and had a MOR format until 1976, when it simulcasted WTAE (AM) during the day and played disco at night, and became known as \\"Disco 96.\\" As disco began to wane in popularity, the station flipped to a rock-leaning top 40 format as WXKX (96KX or \\"96 Kicks\\"). 96KX thrived for the next five years and ranked as the frequency's most highly rated format for three decades. On January 17, 1983, faced with new competition from WBZZ (B-94), the station shifted to a more mainstream top 40 format and became \\"HitRadio 96\\". The call letters were changed to WHTX on March 25, 1983. Later in the decade, the station evolved into a gold-based adult contemporary format under the name of \\"Gold 96\\". On June 26, 1991, it switched calls to WVTY (\\"Variety 96\\") and format to an adult top 40 approach, which in turn would lead to a Modern AC format (\\"96.1 The River\\") on November 26, 1997.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-12-05.pdf New call letters WDRV would follow on February 27, 1998.

In 2007, the rivalry resumed again when CBS revived \\"B94\\" and used the same conventional direction by going after the same 18-34 audience that WKST has managed to cater. However, B94 still could not compete with WKST-FM, and would switch formats again, this time to sports talk in 2010. In 2012, WKST-FM became the first Top 40 (CHR) in Pittsburgh radio history to record #1 6+ and 12+ ratings. Programming As mentioned above, WKST's musical direction had always favored Rhythmic and/or Dance hits since its 2000 debut, although at times it will add artists like The Lumineers to stay within the Mainstream realm. With B94 changing formats after Valentine's Day 2010, WKST-FM became the only top 40 station in Pittsburgh, and with competition coming from Adult Top 40 WBZZ (whose direction leans towards Top-40 and Rhythmic Contemporary) and a new version of WAMO (via a FM translator, as the AM is a daytimer; now a full-blown Rhythmic Top 40), WKST has continued to add more Rhythmic hits to distinguish itself from the two stations. In addition, WKST is the Pittsburgh affiliate for On Air with Ryan Seacrest weekdays, the iHeartRadio Countdown on Saturday mornings and American Top 40 on Sunday mornings. The Morning Freak Show The Morning Freak Show with Mikey and Big Bob is KISS-FM's morning show. Mikey and Big Bob were involved with two other shows sharing The Freak Show name, the first one on WDRQ in Detroit, Michigan. This show was followed by another one at WIOQ in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These two show were originally hosted by Tic Tak with Mikey and Big Bob as his co-hosts. When the offer came in for the morning show at WKST-FM, Tic Tak did not choose to stay with the show. WKST-FM HD2 On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that WKST- FM's HD2 subchannel will carry a format focusing on Dance hits. The HD2 signed on July 17, 2006, broadcasting the Club Phusion format, which was later replaced with the EDM-focused \\"Evolution\\" brand.

Leroy Adams, a prominent white doctor and state senator‚Äìelect. The judge restricted her testimony, but she did testify as to their sexual relationship and his paternity of her child. The judge prohibited her from recounting her allegations that Adams had repeatedly raped her, and forced her to bear his children. She was sentenced to death for his murder by an all-white jury. The sensational case was covered widely in the United States press (including press report written by Zora Neale Hurston, as well as by international papers. McCollum was subjected to a gag order. Her case was appealed and overturned by the State Supreme Court. Before the second trial, McCollum was examined and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. She was committed to the state mental hospital (Florida State Hospital) at Chattahoochee, Florida. In 1974 her attorney, Frank Cannon, obtained her release under the Baker Act, as she was not considered a danger to herself or others. In the 21st century, McCollum and her case received renewed attention, with books and four film documentaries exploring the issues of race, class, sexual violence, gender, and corruption in local politics from a modernist perspective. McCollum's case is considered a landmark trial by these people in the struggle for civil rights as they believe she was the first black woman to testify against a white man's sexual abuse and paternity of their child. It is considered to have helped change attitudes about the practice of \\"paramour rights‚Äù. McCollum's attorney, Releford McGriff, became part of a team who worked to change Florida's Jim Crow practice of selecting all-white juries. (Black people were still disenfranchised at that time and thus not eligible to serve as jurors, who were limited to voters.) Early life Ruby Jackson was born in 1909 to Gertrude and William Jackson in Zuber, Florida. She was the second child and first daughter among her six siblings. They attended local segregated schools. Ruby's parents recognized her intelligence and sent her to a private school, Fessenden Academy, where she excelled in bookkeeping. Marriage and family In 1931 Ruby Jackson married Sam McCollum. They moved to Nyack, New York, as part of the Great Migration of rural blacks out of the South in the early 20th century. The couple had four children together: Sam, Jr., Sonja, Kay, and Loretta.\\"Misfortune Follows McCollum Principals\\", Ocala Star-Banner, January 13, 1980, accessed March 18, 2014 McCollum later said that her youngest, Loretta, was a biracial child fathered by Dr. C. Leroy Adams in a forced relationship. Business activities In 1934, the couple relocated to the area of Fort Myers, Florida. Sam's gangster brother Buck McCollum had amassed considerable wealth managing a Bolita gambling business. Sam went into business with him and was reported to be a player in North Florida crime, including gambling and liquor sales. These were illegal in the county, but flourished because of payoffs to local law enforcement. In a related sideline, McCollums also sold burial policies and owned a local funeral home. By the 1940s and early 1950s, the McCollums were reported to have \\"amassed a fortune.\\" based on their criminal activities. Sam and Ruby owned a \\"stately, two-story home,\\" in Live Oak, Florida, a small town of 4,000 people, which they acquired from the prior bolita operator in the county when he was run out of town. Ruby McCollum drove a new Chrysler automobile each year. The McCollums owned several \\"jooks\\" (juke joint), served illegal liquor, collected money from the juke boxes, and had a farm outside of town with the largest tobacco allotment in Florida. It was at this time that Ruby developed an addiction to heroin. The McCollums also owned a farm near Lake City, where Sam stocked fields with quail for hunting with his prized bird dogs. Ruby McCollum was described as the wealthiest black woman in town. The couple were considered financially successful and well respected in the community, where they contributed liberally to their church. Their son and oldest child, Sam Jr., had started college at UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) by 1952.\\"Production begins on \\"You Belong to Me,\\" feature of Ruby McCollum‚Äôs life story\\", Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, University of Florida, August 19, 2013, accessed March 18, 2014 Background Florida was a segregated state where black people had been essentially disenfranchised since the turn of the century amid passage of a constitution and laws imposing poll taxes, literacy tests, and other barriers to voter registration and black voting. The exclusion from voting meant that African Americans could not serve on juries, and they were generally excluded from any political office. The white Democrat-dominated state legislature following Reconstruction had passed laws to create legal segregation and Jim Crow. African Americans were kept in second-class status until passage in the mid-1960s of civil rights legislation following their decades of activism and support from the national Democratic Party led by President Lyndon Johnson. The power relations of many white men taking sexual advantage of Black women had a long history dating to slavery times, when enslaved women were frequently raped by white slavers. From the late 17th century, Virginia and other colonies established laws that children of enslaved mothers were also born into slavery, regardless of their paternity, under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. An assumption that powerful white men could take black women as sexual partners, regardless of the women's desire or social status, continued to underlie many 20th century relations. This was called \\"paramour rights\\" at the time of the trial.C. Arthur Ellis, Jr., Zora Hurston and The Strange Case of Ruby McCollum (Gadfly Publishing, 2009), p. i. Ellis attributes the term \\"paramour rights\\" to Zora Neale Hurston. Dr. C. Leroy Adams had a reputation as a \\"benevolent and popular doctor who administered to the needy.\\" In 1952 he was elected to the state senate. His associate, Dr. Dillard Workman, campaigned for him. Adams was considered to have a potential political future as governor. Workman was Ruby McCollum's physician when she was pregnant with Adams' child. He performed the autopsy on Adams and testified to McCollum's sanity during her trial. Shooting of Dr. C. Leroy Adams Ruby McCollum met Dr. C. Leroy Adams, a white physician and state senator-elect, in his office in Live Oak, Florida. She had driven there with her two young children. She later admitted that she shot him four times with a revolver, and said it was because he would not agree to leave her alone. She said that over a period of years, he had repeatedly forced her to submit to sex and to bear his child.Wadsworth, Louie. \\"Dr. Adams Slain by Negress,\\" Suwannee Democrat, August 8, 1952 She claimed that her two-year-old daughter, Loretta, was fathered by him. In notes and letters, McCollum said that Adams had abused her, and that she was pregnant with another child by him when she killed him. She also said that Adams took part in her husband Sam's \\"illegal gambling operation.\\" An employee at the doctor's office later described seeing the doctor accept \\"large deliveries of cash in examination rooms.\\" McCollum was arrested and taken to the state prison 50 miles away. This was temporary and for her protection, according to contemporary accounts. The day after her arrest, her husband Sam died of a heart attack in Zuber, Florida. He had taken their children there for safekeeping with Ruby's mother. First trial McCollum was defended by Frank Cannon, a District Attorney from Jacksonville, Florida. The case was prosecuted by state's attorney Keith Black, and presided over by Florida's Third Circuit Court judge, Judge Hal W. Adams. (He was not related to the doctor, but had been an honorary pallbearer at his funeral). It was an all- white jury, some of whom had been Dr. Adams' patients. (As blacks were disenfranchised and generally not registered to vote, they did not qualify for the jury pool.) Zora Neale Hurston, a black anthropologist and writer on assignment from the Pittsburgh Courier, was the first person to report on the trial for a newspaper outside Florida. She was required to sit upstairs in the segregated gallery of the courtroom. There were likely Ku Klux Klan members attending the trial. Her coverage helped McCollum's case gain a national and international audience. McCollum testified that Adams had raped her, that he raped her in her home and in his office (located immediately across the street from the courthouse), and that he insisted that she bear his child. The court prevented her defense attorney from presenting more complete information about their relationship. All of Cannon's efforts to introduce the doctor's pattern of repeated physical abuse of her at the office were objected to by the prosecutor and upheld by the judge.C. Arthur Ellis, Jr.State of Florida Vs. Ruby McCollum, Defendant, Lulu Publishing, 2007, pp. 283-284 She was allowed to testify only to events on the day of the murder. She said that Adams had struck her repeatedly that day and they struggled. Essentially McCollum was silenced in court regarding additional testimony that would have established mitigating circumstances. According to Zora Neale Hurston, who reported on the trial for the Pittsburgh Courier: > Ruby was allowed to describe how, about 1948, during an extended absence of > her husband, she had, in her home, succumbed to the sexual assault. She was > allowed to state that her youngest child was his. Yet thirty-eight times > Frank Cannon attempted to proceed from this point; thirty-eight times he > attempted to create the opportunity for Ruby to tell her whole story and > thus explain what were her motives; thirty-eight times the State objected; > and thirty-eight times Judge Adams sustained these objections. The judge also imposed a gag order on McCollum, preventing the press from interviewing her. This also prevented her attorneys from the opportunity to determine whether speaking with the press would aid her case. Hurston writes that defense attorney Frank Cannon, frustrated by the court's upholding the state prosecuting attorney's objections to most of the evidence he tried to introduce about McCollum's relationship with Dr. Adams, turned to the judge and said, \\"May God forgive you, Judge Adams, for robbing a human being of life in such a fashion.\\"Zora Neale Hurston, quoted in William B. Huie. Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1956), pp 99-100. While this is written by Hurston, and quoted by Huie, there is no record of the statement in the trial transcript. Hurston reported that Thelma Curry, a witness, was told to leave the witness stand and go back where she belongs. This does not appear in the trial transcript. The prosecuting attorney said that McCollum had shot Adams in anger over a disputed bill, an account supported by three witnesses during the trial. McCollum testified that she had discussed a bill with Adams that day, but maintained that she fired at the doctor in self-defense when he attacked her. The prosecution questioned this, pointing out that Adams was 100 pounds heavier than Ruby McCollum and all of the shots were fired into his back. Residents of Live Oak knew that McCollum was a wealthy woman, and she and her husband were known to pay their bills promptly. McCollum was convicted by the jury of first degree murder on December 20, 1952. She was sentenced to death in the electric chair.State of Florida vs. Ruby McCollum, Defendant.\\"Chair for Ruby: Found Guilty of Slaying Florida White Doctor,\\" The Pittsburgh Courier, December 27, 1952Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit of Florida, in and for Suwannee County. Her case was appealed. During the period before the appeal was decided, McCollum was held in the Suwannee County Jail. Her conviction and death sentence were overturned on a technicality by the Florida Supreme Court on July 20, 1954. The court cited Judge Hal W. Adams, the presiding judge, for failing to be present at the jury's inspection of the scene of the crime.\\"Opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida,\\" filed July 20, 1954. Second trial Concerned for her mental health, defense attorney Frank Cannon arranged for McCollum to be examined in the county jail, where she had been held for about two years. At the second trial, he entered a plea of insanity. Upon receiving the results of an examination of McCollum by court-appointed physicians, including Dr. Adams' associate Dr. Dillard Workman, the state attorney Randall Slaughter agreed to the plea. McCollum was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. She was committed to the Florida State Hospital for mental patients at Chattahoochee, Florida. She was held there until 1974, when her attorney, Frank Cannon, successfully filed for her release under Florida's recently enacted Baker Act. It allowed release of mental patients who were not judged to be a threat to themselves or the community. Coverage There was extensive coverage of the trial, but the judge put McCollum under a gag order. The press was never allowed to interview McCollum. Ellis, who remembers the trial in his hometown, emphasizes that this isolation of McCollum from the press was done less to cover up the affair between McCollum and Adams, which was already making the gossip circuits of the town, than it was to conceal the illegal dealings between whites and blacks in the community related to gambling and liquor. The IRS was in town to collect taxes on unreported gambling and liquor sales. Ellis writes that this attempt to silence McCollum proved in the long run to be totally unsuccessful. Following his publication of the annotated transcript of the trial, McCollum and her case have been the subject of a number of books and documentaries published since his release of the annotated transcript of the trial.C. Arthur Ellis, Jr., State of Florida vs. Ruby McCollum, Defendant (LuLu Press, 2007) The noted African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston covered the trial for the Pittsburgh Courier from the fall of 1952 through Ruby McCollum's conviction just before Christmas that year. She was forced to sit in the segregated second-floor gallery of the courtroom. From January‚ÄìMarch 1953, the Courier published Hurston's series entitled, \\"The Life Story of Ruby McCollum\\". Hurston, who was unable to attend the appeal or the second trial for financial reasons, contacted journalist William Bradford Huie to interest him in the case. They had worked together before and he had taken on controversial cases. She shared her notes from the first trial and corresponded with him to furnish additional information. She also asked for bus fare to attend the trial, but Huie did not respond. Huie did investigate the story and, after attending the appeal and second trial, published Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail (1956). This book became a bestseller. Huie asked his publisher not to distribute the book in Florida due to his continuing legal troubles there.Elizabeth Boyd, \\"Disquiet\\", Review of Tammy Evans, The Silencing of Ruby McCollum: Race, Class, and Gender in the South, H-Net Review, July 2008, accessed March 18, 2014 Huie's book also addresses his effort to fight Judge Adams' gag order against the press. He filed a First Amendment challenge, claiming freedom of the press to speak to the defendant, but did not succeed in his suit. At one point, Judge Adams charged Huie with contempt of court for attempting to influence Dr. Fernay, a witness scheduled to testify as to McCollum's sanity.\\"The Press: Case of Ruby McCollum\\", Time, October 25, 1954 The journalist served overnight in jail as a result of not paying a fine the judge had imposed in the contempt charge.\\"Writer Discusses 6 Film Properties\\", New York Times, February 10, 1960, accessed March 19, 2014 During that period, Huie met the director, Elia Kazan. In 1960 they had discussions about Kazan's directing a film to be adapted from Huie's book and entitled The Ruby McCollum Story. While other films based on Huie's books were produced in the 1960s and later, none was made from his account of the Ruby McCollum story. Huie says in his updated, fourth edition of his work (1964) that he was denied entrance to the Florida State Mental Hospital in Chattahoochee, Florida where Ruby McCollum was held. Jet Magazine reporters visited Ruby McCollum there in 1958 and published their interview with her.\\"Ruby McCollum Talks: Ends 5-year Silence in Insane Asylum,\\" Jet Magazine, February 20, 1958 Huie never interviewed McCollum. Later years and death In 1974, attorney Frank Cannon, who was her primary attorney during her murder trial in 1952, visited McCollum in the mental hospital. Without asking for any legal fees, he filed legal papers to have her released under the Baker Act. This allowed mental patients who were considered not to be a danger to be released to their families. Her initial commitment had been due to her having been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. McCollum lived after her release in a rest home in Silver Springs, Florida, funded by a trust set up by author William Bradford Huie. He had paid her $40,000 for the movie rights for a feature film which he hoped to have adapted from his book about the case, Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail (1964, 4th edition). McCollum was finally able to see her children again. Sam Jr. had been convicted in 1975 in federal court on 10 counts of gambling. He had been living in the McCollum homestead, from which the FBI confiscated $250,000. They later returned a good portion of it to him, after the IRS deducted appropriate taxes and penalties. McCollum's daughters Sonja and Kay both married and lived in Ocala, Florida. Kay (McCollum) Hope died in a car accident in 1978 and Sonja (McCollum) Wood died of a heart attack in 1979. In November 1980, Al Lee of the Ocala Star Banner interviewed McCollum at the rest home in Silver Springs.Al Lee, \\"Memory of Murder Fades After 28 Years\\", Ocala Star Banner, January 13, 1980 Lee wrote that McCollum had no memory of her ordeal. He reported that psychiatrists said that she may have suffered Ganser syndrome, or the suppression of painful memories. In those years, the State Mental Hospital at Chattahoochee was investigated more than once over issues of patient treatment, overuse of medications including thorazine, and the administration of electroshock therapy, which can affect memory. On May 23, 1992, at 4:45 a.m., McCollum died of a stroke at the New Horizon Rehabilitation Center, at the age of 82.State of Florida, Office of Vital Statistics. Death Certificate No. 92-057582, local file No. 1238. Her brother, Matt Jackson, had died less than a year before. The family arranged for her to be buried beside him and his wife in the cemetery behind Hopewell Baptist Church in Live Oak. Her name was mistakenly spelled on her death certificate as \\"Ruby McCollumn\\". Aftermath The case has haunted people, in part because of Judge Adams's gag order. Some commentators said the silences were to keep quiet the fact that there had been some white participation in Sam McCollum's illegal bolita operations, source of untaxed money to help finance the participants‚Äô businesses in town. As Judge Adams upheld prosecutor's objections during the trial, the defense attorney Cannon was prevented from introducing most of the evidence related to Adams' sexual abuse of McCollum. She was allowed, however, to testify to being forced to have Adams' baby. This was the first time that a black woman had testified to a white man's paternity of her child and other circumstances of her defense. This established the trial as a landmark case, since no other black woman who had shot and killed a white man had ever been allowed to testify in her own defense. In the 21st century, new non-fiction and fiction books continue to be published about McCollum and the case. C. Arthur Ellis, Jr. published a compiled and edited transcript of the trial in 2003, with a revised edition in 2007. His associated commentary describes the importance of this trial in the history of civil rights as the first time that an African- American woman testified in court against a white man to say that he had forced sex upon her, and testified to his paternity of their child. Until this time, Ellis notes, African-American women were afforded no protection under the law for rape by a white man. Ellis said he published the transcript because many scholars had mistakenly said that McCollum did not testify at her trial; they had noted that the court upheld most of the objections of the prosecution to introducing testimony about the abusive relationship. A 2014 episode of the Investigation Discovery show A Crime to Remember, \\"The Shot Doctor,\\" perpetuated this error. In his annotated edition, Ellis explores the intertwining of personal and professional relationships among the figures prominent in the case and the trial. He noted that late 20th and early 21st- century professional standards related to conflict of interest would likely classify certain figures as having violated those standards. As an example, he notes that Dr. Dillard Workman was Adams' medical associate. He treated McCollum for her prenatal care of her child by Adams. Workman had campaigned for Adams in his state senatorial race. He was commissioned to conduct Adams' autopsy and testified about it during the murder trial of his patient, McCollum, the defendant. In addition, at the second trial of McCollum, he testified as an expert witness as to her sanity. He would likely be considered today to be violating his obligation to her as his patient in these actions. In addition, the judge who presided over the trial was a pallbearer at Dr. Adams' funeral. In 2006, Tammy Evans published The Silencing of Ruby McCollum: Race, Class, and Gender in the South through University Press of Florida. Reviewer Elizabeth Boyd writes, \\"The starkness of the crime was matched only by the evasiveness that characterized its aftermath, and it is this prevarication--this collective dissembling on the part of Live Oak folk, white and black--that is the true subject of the book.\\" Evans focuses on the silencing of Ruby McCollum by the court placing a gag order on her and prohibiting her from speaking to the press. She said this freed whites to create a \\"cover story.\\" Ellis says that the town's silence towards \\"outsiders\\" was out of fear of the IRS, whose agents were scouring the town to uncover covert gambling revenues for which taxes went unpaid. Ellis also points out that the \\"cover story\\" of Ruby McCollum murdering Dr. Adams over a doctor bill resulted from McCollum and Adams arguing over a bill at the time of the murder. Witnesses to the argument testified to the argument, leading to the assumption that the murder was because of the argument. In 2015, Ellis published a book, Hall of Mirrors: Confirmation and Presentist Biases in Continuing Accounts of the Ruby McCollum Story. He explores the biases of filmmakers and academicians in their interpretations of McCollum's story. Ellis published, for the first time, the letters of Ruby McCollum, written from prison and the Florida State Mental Hospital, and the letters of Dr. Adams's nurse, Edith Park. Ellis notes that one of McCollum's letters to her attorneys speaks of her turning down an interview with a reporter from a Jacksonville newspaper who visited her in prison at Raiford.

He was the youngest son of Baha' al-Dawla.  Biography  In 1021 the Turkish establishment in Baghdad, which had become upset over the influence of amir Sultan al-Dawla's Daylamite troops, raised Abu 'Ali to power. Given the title \\"Musharrif al-Dawla\\", he decided to negotiate with Sultan al-Dawla. At length, he became Sultan al- Dawla's vassal and was given a heretofore unused title, the \\"King of Iraq\\". The latter, however, wanted direct control over the region, and invaded Iraq. He was defeated by Musharrif al-Dawla's army. Musharrif al-Dawla thereafter considered himself as Sultan al-Dawla's equal and assumed the title of \\"Shahanshah\\". For the rest of his reign, he was forced to placate the troops that had brought him to power. During his reign, Musharrif al-Dawla undertook a campaign against the Kakuyids. After establishing a state in Isfahan that was independent of the Buyids, they had steadily expanded, culminating with their seizure of Hulwan from the 'Annazids. Musharrif al-Dawla forced them to withdraw from that city, but the Kakuyids maintained their hold elsewhere, and peace was declared between the two sides. The truce was cemented with a marriage alliance. Despite his success at keeping his neighbors in check, Musharrif al-Dawla failed to solve the internal problems of his state. These problems were largely intact when he died in mid-1025. The army, which took charge of the succession, took more than two years before finally definitively agreeing to Jalal al-Dawla as amir.

The word is most often used for the offspring of mammals, but can be used for any animal that gives birth to multiple young. In comparison, a group of eggs and the offspring that hatch from them are frequently called a clutch, while young birds are often called a brood. Animals from the same litter are referred to as litter-mates. A species' average litter size is generally equal to one half of the number of teats and the maximum litter size generally matches the number of teats. Not all species abide by this rule, however. The naked mole rat, for example, averages roughly eleven young per birth and has eleven teats. Animals frequently display grouping behavior in herds, swarms, flocks, or colonies, and these multiple births derive similar advantages. A litter offers some protection from predation, not particularly to the individual young but to the parents' investment in breeding. With multiple young, predators could eat several and others could still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season. The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group. Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or runts, to die through lack of care. In the wild, only a small percentage, if any, of the litter may survive to maturity, whereas for domesticated animals and those in captivity with human care the whole litter almost always survives. Kittens and puppies are in this group. Carnivorans, rodents, and pigs usually have litters, while primates and larger herbivores usually have singletons.

It was similar to Philadelphia's American Bandstand. The Buddy Deane Show was taken off the air because home station WJZ-TV was unwilling to integrate black and white dancers. Deane's dance party television show debuted in 1957 and was, for a time, the most popular local show in the United States. It aired for two and a half hours a day, six days a week. Teenagers who appeared on the show every day were known as \\"The Committee\\". Committee members included Mike Miller, Charlie Bledsoe, Ron Osher, Mary Lou Raines, Pat(ricia) Tacey, and Cathy Schmink. Hundreds of thousands of teens learned the latest dances by watching Committee members on the show, copying their personal style, and following their life stories and interactions. Many top acts of the day, both black and white, appeared on The Buddy Deane Show. Acts that appeared on the show first were reportedly barred from appearing on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, but if they had been on Bandstand first they could still be on The Buddy Deane Show. The rivalry with Dick Clark meant that Deane urged all his performers not to mention American Bandstand or visits to Clark in Philadelphia. Although WJZ-TV, owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting (now CBS since January 2, 1995), was an ABC affiliate, the station \\"blacked out\\" the network broadcast of American Bandstand in Baltimore and broadcast the Deane program instead, reportedly because Bandstand showed black teenagers dancing on the show (although black and white teenagers were not allowed to dance together until the show was moved to California in 1964). The Deane program set aside every other Friday for a show featuring only black teenagers. For the rest of the time, the show's participants were all white. Owing to Deane's mid-South roots and work history, he featured many performers from the ranks of country and western music (e.g., Skeeter Davis, singing \\"The End of the World\\" and Brenda Lee singing \\"Sweet Nothin's\\"), who then achieved cross-over hits among rock and roll fans. Dean also played songs that other disc jockeys, including Dick Clark, refused to present to mostly white teen TV audiences because the acts sounded \\"too black\\" (e.g. \\"Do You Love Me\\" by The Contours, or \\"Hide and Go Seek\\" by Bunker Hill). With an ear for music seasoned by many more years as a disk jockey than Clark, Deane also brought to his audience a wider array of white musical acts than were seen on American Bandstand. For example, Carole King appeared on the show playing her single \\"It Might as Well Rain Until September\\", nearly a decade before she burst to popularity with her landmark 1970 album, Tapestry. Deane also presented British artist Helen Shapiro, who sang her Baltimore hit, \\"Tell Me What He Said,\\" at about the time that she was touring England with The Beatles as one of her support acts. Deane organized and disc-jockeyed dances in public venues across the WJZ-TV broadcast area, including much of central Maryland, Delaware, and southern Pennsylvania where tens of thousands of teenagers were exposed to live recording artists and TV personalities. In several instances, the show went on location to the Milford Mill swim club on the westside of suburban Baltimore County. Almost all dancers wore swim wear and beach attire, with music provided by WJZ-TV. As well, a show was broadcast from a local farm in Westminster, Maryland. Participants dressed in \\"country\\" style, and danced to country and western music as well as pop. Several local art contests were also held on the show, with viewers submitting their own art work. Deane also held dances at various Maryland American Legion posts and National Guard armories which were not taped or broadcast on television. \\"Buddy\\" Deane was a broadcaster for more than 50 years, beginning his career in Little Rock, Arkansas, then moving to the Memphis, Tennessee market, before moving on to Baltimore, where he worked at WITH radio. He was one of the first disc jockeys in the area to regularly feature rock and roll. Deane died in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on July 16, 2003, after suffering a stroke. He was 78.  Legacy  Dick Clark patterned his ABC-TV show, Where the Action Is, after local remotes done by Deane in Maryland. The racial integration of a take-off of the show, dubbed The Corny Collins Show, provides the backdrop to the 1988 John Waters film Hairspray. The film would spawn a 2002 Broadway musical adaptation starring Harvey Fierstein and Marissa Jaret Winokur, and a 2007 film adaptation of the musical starring John Travolta and Nikki Blonsky. Although he never appeared on Deane's show, Waters attended high school with a \\"Buddy Deaner\\" and later gave Deane a cameo in the film, in which Deane played a TV reporter who tried to interview the governor who was besieged by integration protesters. As with many other local TV shows, little footage of the show is known to have survived. When Barry Levinson, another Baltimore native, requested vision from the show for his film Diner, the station told him it had no footage.

The village is about north of Cheltenham, east of Tewkesbury, south of Evesham and west of Stow-on-the-Wold. The main roads are the B4077 (Stow Road) and the A46. The parish has 1,170 residents. Church and chapel The Church of England parish church of St Margaret of Antioch may originate from the Anglo-Saxon era. The current building is mostly 14th century and was restored in 1890-92. St Margaret's ecclesiastical parish forms part of the Alderton benefice that incorporates the nearby villages of Dumbleton, Little Washbourne and Great Washbourne. The benefice is administered from St Peter's church, Winchcombe. Alderton Methodist chapel was built in 1899. It is now a private house. NeighbourhoodsAlderton Fields= Alderton parish includes the satellite settlement of Alderton Fields, which is conjoined with Gretton Fields, Gretton. The distinctiveness of Alderton Fields, as a separate entity to Gretton Fields, was the subject of controversy when in the early 2000s, a road sign declared the whole area to be named Gretton Fields. The sign has since been moved to the Gretton parish boundary, and a new sign for Alderton Fields erected. =Oak Hill= The name of the hill between Alderton and Dumbleton is the subject of local rivalry. There are three peaks to the hill, which are distinctively and separately named Dumbleton Hill, Alderton Hill and Oak Hill on Ordnance Survey maps. To avoid controversy, the local primary school - which has two sites, one each in Alderton and Dumbleton - took the name Oak Hill. However, local residents will use the three names Oak Hill, Dumbleton Hill and Alderton Hill interchangeably to refer to the same hill, rather than the individual peaks. Facilities The village has the Gardners Arms pub, a local garage and petrol station, and a village shop that includes a post office. There is also the Junior campus of Oak Hill Primary School - the Infant campus being in nearby Dumbleton. There is a number of pubs in the outlying areas around the village, including the Hobnails Inn at Little Washbourne. A milkman continues to provide doorstep delivery of dairy and bakery goods on certain days of the week - including milk sourced locally from dairy farms in the parish (although pasteurisation occurs at the Cotteswold Dairy plant in Tewkesbury). Most of the residents are either retired or commute to jobs in nearby Tewkesbury, Cheltenham or Evesham. A small number of people work in farming: there is a large dairy farm in the parish, plus sheep and wheat farming. Others work in tourism: there are several bed and breakfast guest houses, and a number of houses available as holiday lets. The Winchcombe Camping and Caravanning Club has a large campsite on the B4077 near Gretton. There is a free public WiFi hotspot provided from nearby Frampton Cottages. ADSL broadband is available throughout the parish. In December 2006 a book documenting life in the village, along with some of its history, was published. The book was featured in the April 2007 edition of Country Life. Architecture and Environment Lying on the edge of both the Cotswolds and the Vale of Evesham, the village incorporates both Cotswold stone and red brick architecture, in addition to wattle and daub half-timbered thatched buildings, plus more modern houses and bungalows with Cotswold stone cladding. There are also a small number of council houses with white pebbledash. Several houses in the outlying areas of the parish are built in a Victorian style using local red brick manufactured from a now-disused clay mine on the top of the nearby Oak Hill (also called Dumbleton Hill or Alderton Hill); these were originally constructed as farmworkers' cottages for the Dumbleton Hall estate (Dumbleton Hall itself is now a hotel). A footpath system connects the village over the wooded Oak Hill to the nearby village of Dumbleton. These footpaths are known locally as \\"The Dungeons\\" due to the deep channel that they cut into the hillside and the darkness of overhanging trees. Oak Hill itself remains a managed estate, with organised game bird shooting and rearing of deer for sale to other game estates. A number of gamekeepers ensure public safety by directing ramblers to keep to marked footpaths.

Population  The village had a population of less than 300, of which the majority were professional commuters and elderly pensioners. The population increased to 393 at the 2011 census. It has an archaic water pump, a village hall and some property dating from the 18th century and earlier. Nearby is the \\"Teddington Hands\\" pub, the name of which refers to the crossroads sign that was renovated as part of the 2000 Millennium celebrations. Opposite the pub and outside a Texaco service station is a standing stone of purportedly mystical significance and is believed to be over 2,000 years old.  History  The village dates from the 8th century. The Teddington Hands Inn (nearby but not in the village) was originally known as the Cross Hands Inn and the name change only took place in the late 1980s after construction of the Teddington Hands Roundabout which realigned the Stow road away from the side of the premises due to a high volume of serious road traffic accidents. The area gets its name from the historic fingerpost which formerly stood at the crossroads but now stands adjacent to the entrance to the pub. The finger post is a listed structure. During the Second World War an American military base was in the field to the rear of the pub and Joe Louis the heavyweight boxer fought an exhibition match in the field and all the surrounding villagers were invited. Glenn Miller also entertained troops in an adjacent field and visited the pub for refreshments prior to going to Cheltenham to perform a further concert. The following day he left from a nearby airfield for France. He and the plane he was travelling in was never seen again. The current theory being is small plane was hit by bombs discharged from returning allied bombers over the channel. So the Teddington Hands Inn is possibly the last pub Glenn Miller ever visited.  Sights  The village has an ancient church that is thought to date from the 12th century. The interior wall has a partially faded mural of the Lion and the Unicorn that dates from the second half of the 17th century. It also contains an arch sourced from Hailes Abbey after the latter was destroyed following the dissolution of the monasteries.  Surrounding area  The villages of Teddington and Alstone, separated by the tiny hamlet of Bengrove lie in gently rolling countryside near the foot of the Cotswold escarpment, almost equidistant from the towns of Cheltenham, Tewkesbury and Evesham. Each a distinct community but their proximity to each other and their small size, a combined adult population of almost 330, means that the people who live here join together for social occasions and religious observances. Teddington and Alstone now lie in the Anglican Diocese of Worcester, although they have been part of Gloucestershire since 1932, falling within the borough and Parliamentary constituency of Tewkesbury. The existence of this parish began when the standing stone was founded and was thought to bring good-natured happenings and luck. Travellers came into the area looking to see the stone until there was a whole community of travellers and settlers. After a few years there were thriving businesses and schools worthy for education of children. Even today people moving house or coming into retirement like to travel to Teddington for its famous brews and the \\"mystical significance\\" of the standing stone.

It is owned by St. Joseph Missions, a Catholic-based organization based in Pittsburgh. WAOB-FM is licensed to Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, broadcasts at 106.7 MHz. Its transmitter is located in Wexford, Pennsylvania. When WAOB was WAMO-FM, its owner was Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, which had owned the station from 1972 to 2009. During its tenure under Sheridan, WAMO's format was Urban Contemporary until September 8, 2009, when it signed off for the last time. The station was relaunched as a non-commercial outlet in February 2010. History WAOB-FM on a SPARC HD Radio with RDS. 106.7 FM signed on in 1960 as WWKS, and was a long-time beautiful music/easy listening station known as \\"Kiss FM\\", which would later flip to classic rock. By November 1993, 106.7 FM was known as \\"The Force\\" with an album rock format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-11-26.pdf The Force touted itself with the motto \\"The Best of Rock\\". The station flipped to modern rock in 1995 as \\"106-7 The X\\", WXDX. The station became the Pittsburgh affiliate for Howard Stern, beginning that November. On April 10, 1996, at 3 PM, WXDX swapped frequencies with WAMO- FM, and moved to the 105.9 frequency. This came after Clear Channel, the owner of WXDX, paid Sheridan Broadcasting (WAMO's owners) to swap frequencies and wanting better full-market coverage. (Sheridan was also running into financial difficulties during this time.) The swap resulted in WAMO moving to the weaker 106.7 frequency. To make up for the loss of coverage, WAMO also simulcasted its format with WSSZ to cover the eastern part of the metropolitan area beginning that same year. In 2004, WAMO relocated its transmitter, resulting in full-market coverage; at the same time, WSSZ broke from the simulcast and shifted to Urban Adult Contemporary and became WJJJ-FM, \\"Majic 107.1\\".

The deal has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission, and the stations were to change to a religious format by February 2010. All 35 employees were let go after the sale closed, leaving Pittsburgh without an Urban formatted outlet. The call letters were changed to WAOB upon the transfer of ownership.\\"Reports: Sheridan Sells Pittsburgh Trio\\" from R&R; (May 15, 2009)\\"WAMO's format to change with sale\\" from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (May 16, 2009) The news of this sale attracted a lot of attention,\\"Sheridan/Pittsburgh Buyer Leap-Frogged Into Deal\\" from R&R; (May 18, 2009) and the reaction from listeners,from Radio-Info Pittsburgh message boardfrom City-Data Pittsburgh message board who will be left with no options in the market.\\"Questions remain about future of WAMO radio after its sale\\" from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (May 18, 2009)\\"Ciao, WAMO -- we hardly knew you anymore\\" from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (May 19, 2009) However, due to the high ratings WAMO-FM had with its urban format, it was assumed another station in Pittsburgh would switch to Urban to take advantage of the newly available audience. Some had hoped that WOGI would pick up the Urban format because its signal (98.3) was ripe for targeting WAMO's audience, but instead Keymarket sold the station to Educational Media Foundation, who replaced WOGI's Country format with its K-Love Christian contemporary brand. At 6:07 pm EST on Tuesday, September 8, 2009, WAMO-FM discontinued broadcasting. Its last song was Boyz II Men's It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday, which was followed by silence. Since then, other outlets began adding some form of Urban or R&B; programming, as AC outlet WLTJ launched a nighttime Adult R&B; program called \\"Q after Dark\\" aimed at a 25-54 audience in the same month. In addition, the hiphop & R&B; playlist was largely increased on Clear Channel's WKST-FM (96.1 Kiss FM), a top 40 station that had been moving towards a rhythmic top 40 direction, but with Mainstream top 40 rival WBZW (B94) switching to Sports Talk, this once again left Pittsburgh without any full-time R&B;/Hip-Hop or Urban outlet as WKST has toned down the Rhythmic content. In October 2009, Eddie Edwards, the one-time owner of then independent television outlet WPTT, announced that he was acquiring AM outlet WPYT, a station with good daytime coverage but not so good coverage at night. Edwards hoped that he could fill the Urban void with this new outlet (in actuality the format would be Urban Talk, targeting 25-54 African-Americans in the Pittsburgh metro), which pending FCC approval, would have started in February 2010. However, on November 3, 2009, it was announced that those plans have fallen through after his son, Eddie Edwards Jr., confirmed that the senior Edwards withdrew the application due to health problems and was hospitalized under a doctor's care. 106.7 FM returned to the air on February 15, 2010 with a live broadcast of a Catholic Mass. After its conclusion, the station announced that WAOB would begin regular programming on March 19, with only Mass broadcasts being carried in the interim. WAMO's return On May 22, 2011, Martz Communications debuted the new WAMO on 660 AM and 100.1 FM, which is a translator under the W261AX call letters. It is licensed to Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. WAOB's New Start In March 2010 under new ownership, WAOB radio became known as WAOB \\"We Are One Body\\" FM Radio. It now operates as an official Catholic media outlet from its headquarters in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The following is taken from their website waob.org : \\"We Are One Body (WAOB) produces catechetical and contemplative programming. The programming is intended to present the life of the Church in a way that makes the Mystical Body of Christ more apparent: the Pope and bishops united with their priests, in their role as head, working together with the laity in their role as members. The catechetical programming consists of magisterial teaching from the Pope and bishops followed by conversations between priests who explain and elaborate on the magisterial teaching. The We Are One Body programming also contains broadcasts of lectio divina, led by priests, on Scripture, the writings of the saints, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church; leading listeners to interior silence and contemplation through meditation and prayer. The programming described above is supported by broadcasts of prayer from parishes, families and religious orders, including the Holy Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours, and devotions such as the Rosary and Divine Mercy Chaplet.\\" ReferencesExternal links * AOB-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1960 Category:Catholic radio stations AOB-FM ","title":"WAOB-FM"},{"id":"2735085","text":"Rocketmen was a constructible strategy game produced by WizKids and released in 2005 and discontinued in 2006. Part of its marketing included animated adventures based on the character of Nick Sion, a rebel and adventurer facing the evil alliance of Terra and Mars. Announced by Capcom, Rocketmen: Axis Of Evil, a downloadable arcade style video game based on the constructible strategy game, was slated to be released Fall 2007 for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. Rocketmen: Axis of Evil received a Vanguard Unique Game Award at the 2006 Origins Game Fair. Description Similar to Wizkids's sailing-themed Pirates of the Spanish Main, Rocketmen is a game featuring spaceships constructed from polystyrene cards purchased in randomly assorted booster packs. Ships can be customized with various crew and equipment configurations, all of which are used to construct a single fleet. A single booster pack can contain enough for a basic game (two ships, a crew card, a resource card, an asteroid card, a die, and a rules booklet), but maximum customizability requires access to a wider collection. Ship Types include: *Fighter Squadrons *Rocketships *Cruisers *Space Stations *Harvesters Pod Types include: *Arc Laser (red) *Shields (blue) *Tractor beam (purple) In addition, there are asteroid cards used as a home base during most scenarios. There are also resource chips (called microids) used to construct ships held in reserve in certain games, or as victory points in others. =Factions= The setting for Rocketmen: Axis of Evil is heavily influenced by movie serial- era space operas. *Legion of Terra ‚Äì ruled by a xenophobic totalitarian leader Lord Invictus, the Legion of Terra is a vastly powerful army of disciplined soldiers *Mars ‚Äì allied with Terra in the Axis of Evil, the green-skinned Martians have a society entirely based on war *Venus ‚Äì part of the Alliance of Free Planets, the blue-skinned Venusians are a people who believe in logic, science, and pacifism and follow a matriarchal society. *Mercury ‚Äì part of the Alliance of Free Planets yet traditional enemies of the people of Venus, the golden-skinned Amazon warriors of Mercury are also a matriarchal society, ruled by the Empress Armada. *Rebels ‚Äì part of the Alliance of Free Planets, the Terran Rebels fight against their own people in an effort to free Earth =Sets= *Axis of Evil ‚Äì Base set. *Battle of Titans ‚Äì Released December 2005.

Established in 1884 as Glendale Cemetery, it changed its name to Grand View Memorial Park in 1919. The cemetery was the focus of a scandal that began in 2005, during which the operators were accused of leaving thousands of remains unburied. New owners changed the name to Grand View Memorial Park and Crematory in 2015 and began a restoration of the property. Founding and first 90 years The cemetery was founded in 1884, and was the only cemetery in the area until Forest Lawn Memorial Park was constructed in 1906. The site was heavily wooded, and its 4 percent grade provided good drainage. The burial ground was purchased by local builder Len C. Davis in 1919 and incorporated in late December with capital stock worth $20,000 ($ in dollars). (Each stock was worth $100 par value.) A perpetual care trust was also established for the first time. Significant improvements were made which included the addition of a high, electrically illuminated arch over the entrance on Glenwood Road. Construction of a $14,000 ($ in dollars), 18-receiving vault chapel began in 1921.; =Mausoleum construction= The cemetery began planning for a large mausoleum in 1920, although it was not begun until 1923. The mausoleum was long, running along Sonora Avenue between W. Kenneth and Glenwood Roads. The $400,000 ($ in dollars), one-story structure was made of reinforced concrete and consisted of 12 distinct \\"buildings\\". The interior of the mausoleum was clad in marble and had bronze finishings and cathedral glass windows. \\"Quaint\\" electric lamps provided interior illumination, while skylights in the roof of each \\"building\\" provided additional light. The mausoleum contained a total of 3,400 crypts. Each crypt was high, and there were five crypts in each room. A dry-air circulation system in each crypt helped to encourage desiccation and reduce odor. The cemetery assigned several sections of the mausoleum to local fraternal orders for burial of their dead. The mausoleum also featured a number of \\"private rooms\\". Each private room contained two or more crypts, and had its own exterior window. In the center of the mausoleum was a wide, deep new chapel with white stucco exterior walls. The below-ground level of the chapel contained a crematory with four retorts. The chapel itself was clad in marble and mosaic tile and seated 200. It featured Italian vases high in which plants grew. The chapel also contained 2,000 niches for the emplacement of cremation urns. The $60,000 ($ in dollars) first phase of the construction consisted of a structure deep and long, containing 400 crypts. This portion of the mausoleum was constructed by local builder C.A. Cornell. In August 1924, the cemetery began construction on the north mausoleum, which expanded capacity to 5,700 crypts. The original chapel, mausoleum, and cemetery office are all in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. =Hepburn ownership= By 1929, the cemetery had 4,000 interments, with about 10 percent of lots sold. Len C. Davis and his wife divorced that same year. The cemetery was one of the disputed assets in the case. In July 1930, a court ordered Len Davis to divest his interest in the cemetery in order to pay alimony to his wife. Davis sold the cemetery for $2 million ($ in dollars) in March 1931 to a group of investors that included E. H. Dimity, Charles H. Johnston, and William H. Kittle. The new owners planned to build a large new mausoleum along Kenneth Road, and move the cemetery's main entrance there. These plans were never acted on. Local real estate developer David W. Hepburn was hired that same year to manage the cemetery, and purchased the burial ground some time between 1930 and 1946. The cemetery completed a multi-year, $3 million ($ in dollars) building project in 1949. The full extent of the project was not clear, but included a new wall around the property. The cemetery at that time planned to erect a 25,000-crypt mausoleum, but this effort was never begun. In time Hepburn's son, David N. Hepburn, took over the cemetery's management. David N. Hepburn was a highly respected cemetery operator both in the state and California and at one point was president of the Cemetery Association of America. Grand View Memorial stopped scattering ashes in its various memorial gardens and terraces in the late 1970s after the buildup of remains became too noticeable. The cemetery started storing cremains for five years, and buried them if they were not claimed. David N. Hepburn retired in 1990, after which Jack Grossman was employed as superintendent of the cemetery. =Grand View Partners ownership= The Hepburns sold the cemetery to a new firm, Grand View Partners, in 1991. Marsha Lee Howard, a veteran cemetery industry professional, was hired as the new superintendent. Howard employed her brother, Tom Trimble, as a groundskeeper from 1991 until 2003. In 1998, people living near the cemetery complained about smoke and odors emanating from the burial ground's crematory. The cemetery was warned by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD; a state air pollution control agency) that its crematory was not in compliance with state and federal pollution control laws and regulations. After a complaint by a plot owner, a 1998 inspection of the cemetery by the Cemetery and Funeral Bureau (CFB) of the California Department of Consumer Affairs turned up numerous record-keeping problems, and the cemetery was fined $52,200 ($ in dollars). Howard ownership In 1999, Grand View partners sold the cemetery to Marsha Lee Howard and Moshe Goldsman. According to Howard's brother, Tom Trimble, the cemetery was already in disarray and disrepair when it was offered for sale. Howard purchased the property both as a means of advancing her career and because she wanted to restore the burial ground. Howard lacked the money to buy Grand View outright, so she sought an investment partner. Howard was the majority owner, with 51 percent. Moshe Goldsman was the sole minority owner, with the remaining 49 percent. According to Trimble, there were extensive cemetery practice, maintenance, and record-keeping problems at Grand View long before Howard purchased the burial ground. The cemetery, he said, had no functioning lawn or tree care equipment, many headstones were leaning or had toppled over, and all irrigation was done by hand. Howard purchased a riding lawn mower, began regular mowing of the site, and started straightening headstones. She also had an irrigation sprinkler system installed in section M, the largest section at Grand View. The CFB inspected the cemetery again in 1999 after another complaint was filed, and once more fined Howard $52,200 ($ in dollars) for failing to keep proper records. Howard suffered from Type 1 diabetes, and beginning in September 2002 suffered three life-threatening diabetes-related illnesses which left her hospitalized for long periods of time. According to Trimble, management of the cemetery declined significantly during these periods. Complaints about the crematory's smoke and odors continued. SCAQMD issued three notices that the cemetery had violated air pollution control standards, and one order of abatement by the end of 2003. Howard was required to make $37,000 ($ in dollars) in crematory equipment upgrades and limit operations of the crematory to limit pollution. From early 2001 to mid 2005, the CFB received nine complaints from families complaining about cemetery operations. The CFB investigated, but could not verify the complaints. The agency did, however, issue a warning letter to Grand View Memorial in 2004 about its failure to maintain cemetery markers and plot boundary barriers in an acceptable condition. =2005 scandal= In the spring of 2004, the state of California enacted legislation giving the CFB authority to inspect cemeteries and other burial sites on an annual basis (not just when a complaint was filed). The first annual inspection of Grand View Memorial Park occurred in May 2005. The results of that inspection were made public in late October 2005. During the inspection, CFB inspectors discovered about 4,000 cremated remains in cardboard boxes and plastic containers in storage rooms and on the floor of the mausoleum, in mausoleum crypts which should have held full-body remains, in the chapel, and in a dumpster. Most of the remains dated to the 1930s and 1940s, with smaller numbers from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. A few remains were from the 1990s. Some containers had spilled, and the remains of several people were mixed together on the floor. The remains of seven individuals were found in the chapel in temporary crypts, having never been permanently interred. CFB inspectors found the cemetery's records in very poor condition. The records room was infested with rodents, and records regarding some of the remains were so incomplete or were missing altogether that the remains could not be identified. Maps of in-ground burials, mausoleum full-body crypt and cremains niche burials, and chapel burials were missing or extremely inaccurate, sometimes showing remains where none were found and sometimes not depicting burials which others records indicated had occurred. Later investigations revealed that a large number of cremated remains had been buried throughout the cemetery without records kept regarding their location. Crematory records were in similar poor condition. The cemetery itself was in general disarray. Most areas were overgrown, and there were numerous dead trees and bushes. All buildings were in disrepair. Groundskeeping tools, trash, caskets and grave markers were scattered over the property and throughout public buildings. So much trash and rodent feces had accumulated in the mausoleum that visitors could not access some crypts or niches. In the below-ground portion of the mausoleum, cremation niches were broken (exposing urns), some urns had been removed from niches, and trash was scattered on the floor. As state officials combed through the cemetery's records, they discovered that Grand View had sold the same plot several times, disinterred bodies from graves and then resold the plots, disinterred bodies without state authorization, buried multiple bodies in a plot that should have held one person, and either failed to place markers on graves or willfully discarded or recycled markers. Advance purchase contracts for plots were inaccurate or incomplete. They also discovered that Howard had removed $40,000 from the perpetual care trust fund as a \\"loan\\" but never repaid it. The CFB issued an order suspending all operations at Grand View Memorial Park. The cemetery was prohibited from selling new graves or soliciting new business. Burials could continue if already planned, or if planned for plots which had already been purchased. Howard and Goldsman's state licenses to operate a cemetery were suspended, and Howard was no longer permitted to act as the burial ground's superintendent. The CFB launched a broader investigation into the cemetery's practices with an eye to turning over evidence to the Los Angeles County District Attorney for possible criminal prosecution. Howard denied knowing that any cremated remains were being stored or that bodies had been improperly buried in the chapel. Those with loved ones buried at Grand View Memorial Park, and those who had purchased plot there, were outraged at the revelations, and within 10 days of the news had filed a numerous civil lawsuits against the cemetery in Los Angeles Superior Court. The CFB executed a search warrant against Grand View Memorial Park on November 2, 2005. An examination of the cemetery's financial records indicated that Howard had commingled corporate funds with her personal assets and those of other businesses she owned. She used cemetery income to pay her personal bills and purchase items for her personal use. Inspectors also found some cemetery records had been destroyed. The agency then accused Howard, Goldsman, and the cemetery as a corporation with 14 major violations of state law and regulations, including fraud, improper use of funds, mishandling of remains, negligence, and reselling graves. =Closure and limited reopening= Although Howard had used the cemetery's caretaker lodge as her private residence for years, after November 5, 2005, she was barred by the CFB from entering the cemetery grounds. She was left destitute by her suspension, lost her health insurance, and was able to pay for diabetic medication only after receiving financial help from a friend. She lived in her car, as she was able to access the caretaker's lodge only during the day. When power was cut to the cemetery, Howard was forced to store her insulin (which required refrigeration) elsewhere. Howard was found dead in the caretaker's lodge on November 4, 2006. She had long suffered from diabetes and emphysema and was in very poor health. Her family did not express surprise at her demise. A coroner later ruled that she had died from natural causes due to complications from her diabetes (acute diabetic ketoacidosis). After Howard's death, her brother Tom Trimble inherited her estate. He was appointed special administrator of Grand View Memorial Park by a probate court the first week of January 2007. Moshe Goldsman, the cemetery's minority owner, was appointed interim operator by the CFB. He closed Grand View Memorial Park to all visitors and family members on June 13, 2006, after he was unable to pay the $40,000 to $50,000 a month ($ to $ in dollars) it took to pay employee salaries and the insurance, mortgage, and utility bills. The City of Glendale reopened Grand View Memorial Park to visitors on August 27, 2006. Thereafter, the city paid the cost for the cemetery to remain open each Sunday from noon to 4 PM. The cost the city $31,000 a month ($ in dollars). In October 2006, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Anthony Mohr placed Grand View Memorial Park under a preservation order, which barred anyone from altering or destroying the cemetery or any of its buildings, grounds, or contents. The following December, Judge Mohr placed a preservation of evidence order on the property to specifically protect any evidence relating to the ongoing lawsuit being pursued by aggrieved families. On February 2, 2007, the first cremation interment was made at the cemetery since the suspension of its operating license on November 5, 2005. This was followed by the first full-body in-ground burial (in a two-person plot which already had one burial) in March 2007. The $2,000 ($ in dollars) cost of burials were born by the individuals, as the cemetery was closed and could not provide staff or services. The City of Glendale voted in June 2007 to spend $187,600 ($ in dollars) for maintenance and $79,800 ($ in dollars) for staff to keep Grand View open from July 2007 to June 2008. By this time, the cemetery was in need of extensive maintenance. No irrigation, tree trimming, or weed control had occurred for more than a year. By August 2007, the city was facing a $400,000 ($ in dollars) maintenance bill to make the cemetery safe for visitors. California's extreme, ongoing drought had killed at least 36 trees, all of which were in danger of toppling. Another 200 trees were so badly damaged that they posed an immediate risk of dropping branches on visitors, and the lack of irrigation had rendered the entire cemetery an extreme fire hazard. When other stakeholders balked at sharing the cost, the city won a public nuisance abatement order. Under existing law, this allowed the city to engage in maintenance activities at the site without the court or owners' consent in order to ensure that public health and safety were preserved. The abatement order also allowed the city to pursue reimbursement from the owners at a later date. =Second closure and abatement= Winning the nuisance abatement order forced the full closure of Grand View Memorial Park, barring all families and visitors from the graveyard. Abatement work began on December 27, 2007. The entire cemetery was covered by an above-ground irrigation system, the knee-high grass was mowed, and the pruning and removal of trees began at an estimated cost of $105,400 ($ in dollars). Four abandoned vehicles (including a hearse) were also removed, and repairs were made to all cemetery buildings to secure them against unauthorized entry. Goldman agreed to use accrued interest in the perpetual care fund to pay these costs. Although abatement was expected to end about the end of February 2008, neither the city nor Goldsman said if the cemetery would reopen. Some time after the initial abatement effort was completed, the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered Grand View Memorial Park opened every other Sunday and on holidays to allow visitation of graves. =Legal issues= As legal proceedings against Grand View Memorial Park progressed, several families sought and won permission from the Superior Court to have their loved ones disinterred from the cemetery. In one case, a family discovered 10 to 20 cremated remains buried alongside a relative. By July 2007, the lawsuits against the cemetery were beginning to move forward. The court identified $6 million ($ in dollars) in insurance and $20,000 to $40,000 ($ to $ in dollars) in perpetual care fund interest which could be used to settle the legal actions against Grand View. The cemetery owners, families, and the CFB settled part of the lawsuit at the end of August 2007. Moshe Goldsman, the sole remaining living stockholder, admitted to three violations of law, all of which concerned taking money from the perpetual care fund. To settle these claims, Goldsman agreed to sell the cemetery within three years and to reimburse the perpetual care fund $50,000 ($ in dollars). The remainder of the legal proceedings against Grand View were settled in March 2010. By this time, all the lawsuits had been consolidated into a single class action. The agreement provided for the cemetery and its insurers to establish a $500,000 ($ in dollars) fund for the restoration of the cemetery, pay $1.1 million ($ in dollars) in legal fees, and pay $2.2 million ($ in dollars) to the estimated 2,500 to 3,000 claimants harmed by the cemetery's actions. Paul Ayers, one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs, agreed to oversee the restoration, which included obtaining, cleaning, organizing, and possibly restoring cemetery records; identifying and properly interring all cremated remains; installing an in-ground irrigation system; and reseeding much of the cemetery's lawns. The restoration work began in July 2010, during which the cemetery was closed for 15 weeks. Using plans drawn up by a landscape architect, between $300,000 and $400,000 ($ to $ in dollars) was spent installing the permanent in-ground irrigation system and planting new trees, shrubs, and grass. The cemetery office was cleaned and a rodent-proof records storage space constructed, and the roof in the West Mausoleum was repaired. Heritage Cemetery Management ownership Grand View was put up for sale in June 2006. With the many lawsuits against the cemetery unresolved, there were no offers. Goldman placed Grand View up for sale again in September 2007 after resolution of the lawsuits, asking $1 million ($ in dollars) for the burial ground. In July 2014, Heritage Cemetery Management, Inc. purchased the burial ground for $890,000 ($ in dollars). The name of the cemetery was changed to Grand View Memorial Park and Crematory. After four years of minimal maintenance, the new owners kept the cemetery open only one day a week while funds were spent restoring the site. On January 1, 2015, the cemetery opened its doors for seven days a week for about six hours a day. Heritage Cemetery Management began locating graves which had become overgrown by grass and uncovering them, renovating the chapel, and repairing the north and west mausoleums. The company also spent $500,000 ($ in dollars) upgrading the crematory, so that it could begin operating again and generating income for the cemetery. About the cemetery Grand View Memorial Park and Crematory is located at 1341 Glenwood Road in Glendale, California. The cemetery has 112,000 spaces for interments. About 44,000 spaces exist for in-ground, full- body burials; the remaining spaces can accommodate only cremated remains. As of 2007, there were about 40,000 total burials at Grand View, and about 2,000 in-ground burial plots remained. There is unused space along W. Kenneth Road which could be used to expand in-ground burial space, and the roads in the cemetery could be narrowed to provide even more additional room. The cemetery has a very large West Mausoleum running nearly the entire length of the site along Sonora Avenue, and a much smaller North Mausoleum near the entrance on W. Kenneth Road. Section M is the largest section at Grand View Memorial Park and Crematory. Rows are often perpendicular to one another, but row markers are above-ground and aid in identifying the locations of plots. The main mausoleum has above-ground and a below-ground floor. The building in the cemetery's northern corner has been leased since about 2004 to St. Kevork Armenian Church, although it was formerly used for cemetery purposes. The cemetery perpetual care fund had a principal of about $1 million ($ in dollars) in January 2008. At that time, the fund generated about $2,000 ($ in dollars) in interest income each month, and the St. Kevork lease brought in another $1,200 ($ in dollars) a month. The American Legion named Grand View Memorial its \\"official\\" burial site for veterans in 1923. By 1949, about 200 active duty and retired members of the armed forces had been buried there. In 2006, Grand View Memorial Park had about a dozen employees. Notable burials A number of notable people are buried at Grand View. They include: * Albert Austin (1881-1973), actor * Earle D.

His first adventure, Fadeout, was published in 1970, and over the next twenty-one years eleven more entries in the series were written: Death Claims (1973), Troublemaker (1975), The Man Everybody Was Afraid Of (1978), Skinflick (1979), Gravedigger (1982), Nightwork (1984), The Little Dog Laughed (1986), Early Graves (1987), Obedience (1988), The Boy Who Was Buried This Morning (1990), and A Country of Old Men (1991). No Exit Books, a British publisher, issued an omnibus volume, The Complete Brandstetter, in 2007 (). Hansen also created a second private investigator, Hack Bohannon, a former deputy sheriff who quits the force after fourteen years because of his disapproval of a whitewashed homicide inquiry and runs a horse farm. He collected five novellas in his 1988 book Bohannon's Book (Countryman Press, 1988; paperback reprint, Penguin, 1989 [). A sequel, also collecting five novellas, appeared in 1993 as Bohannon's Country (Penguin, 1993 ). Hansen published his first work, a poem, in The New Yorker, in 1952. He also published poetry in other magazines, briefly sang with a folk-music-group on a California radio-station, and had several part-time jobs in bookstores and magazines. At the beginning of his career as a novelist, Hansen wrote under the pseudonym James Colton or James Coulton, producing novels such as Strange Marriage and Known Homosexual. He also wrote two gothic novels under the pseudonym Rose Brock. Hansen was also noted for writing poems, teaching workshops, and hosting a 1960s radio-show called Homosexuality Today. In 1970, he helped to found the first Gay Pride Parade in Hollywood. Hansen disliked the term \\"gay\\" and always described himself as \\"homosexual\\". In 1985 Hansen published A Smile in His Lifetime, a non-genre novel about a married gay man who achieves fame, divorces his wife, and heads into a string of homosexual relationships both good and bad. Hansen won the 1992 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, as well as a Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Mystery from the Lambda Literary Foundation for A Country of Old Men: The Last Dave Brandstetter Mystery (1991). He also won the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Fiction for Living Upstairs (1993). Hansen died from heart failure in 2004 at his home in Laguna Beach, California. Family Hansen was married to artist Jane Bancroft, a lesbian, from 1943 to her death in 1994. He said their relationship was that of \\"a gay man and a woman who happened to love each other.\\" They were married for 51 years. Bancroft was an artist, scholar and teacher. She was born in Boston on February 4, 1917, and grew up in El Paso. She was an animal lover and rescued and sheltered strays. She died on September 9, 1994, following a stroke. Following her death, Joseph Hansen wrote the poem The Dark/The Diary (In memoriam: J.B.H., 1917-1994). The couple had one daughter, Barbara, who later had a sex-change operation and changed his name to Daniel James Hansen. According to a friend quoted in an obituary, Hansen also had two long-term male lovers.

These investigations include the organization and financing of the coup, and the identity of the perpetrators. Some alleged that George Speight was only a front-man for a shadowy group of politicians and businessmen; former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka was reported to be one of those under investigation. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes revealed on 4 January 2006 that seven major investigations were currently in progress. In addition, a number of other investigations have either taken place or are being considered. The seven major investigations Commissioner Hughes announced on 5 December 2005 that while some police files contained insufficient evidence, being based to a large extent on hearsay, other files did contain incriminating evidence sufficient to lay charges. He revealed on 4 January 2006 that 21 officers were assigned, four of them full- time, to the seven major investigations, and that allegations made by Maciu Navakasuasua, a coup-convict, and Josaia Waqabaca, a self-declared coup- plotter, had led to three files being reopened. All seven cases would be referred to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) by the end of the month, he said. =1. The removal of Ratu Mara= The first investigation involves the resignation of the then-President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, on 29 May 2000 and the abrogation of the Constitution by the Interim Military Government, 2000 of Commodore Frank Bainimarama which took over. On 21 May 2003, the Police Investigations Department revealed that they had opened an investigation into whether Ratu Mara's resignation had been forced. Police declared at the time that they were facing \\"many challenges\\" in their investigation, finding many officers uncooperative ‚Äì a stance reiterated by police several times, most recently by Hughes on 5 January 2005. Hughes said that this case was legally complex, and that it was compounded by the non-cooperation of key individuals. A meeting is expected to be held between the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to consider certain legal questions that may have a bearing on this case. =2. The alleged financing of the coup= The second investigation concerns the local and foreign businesses and individuals alleged to have financed the coup. Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said that he did not believe anybody had financed the coup, and that the police were looking for \\"a needle in a hay stack.\\" He was supported by Transport Minister Simione Kaitani, who said that the 10,000 people who entered the parliamentary complex during the crisis had contributed to the coup effort out of their own accord. Police Commissioner Hughes, however, announced on 1 September 2005 that the police had concluded that the 2000 coup had been financed by people in the background. In January 2006, he said that 7 individuals and 6 companies and organisation had been implicated; all outstanding files had been completed, and the files on two individuals had already been sent to the DPP. The files contained bank records and individual statements, he revealed. Hughes was quoted in the Fiji Times on 4 February 2006 as saying that this investigation was particularly complex with many witnesses unwilling to divulge information. Whether charges could be laid in such circumstances was problematic, he said; the decision would be up the DPP. Hughes told Radio New Zealand on 16 March that investigations indicated that finance for the coup had been provided from abroad, though details were still sketchy. The gathering of data was compounded by the facts that all financial transactions appeared to have been in cash rather than cheques, he said. =3. The Chaudhry kidnap and assassination plot= The third investigation concerns allegations made in a number police statements, as well as interviews with the Fiji Sun, beginning in September 2005. On 21 September, Navakasuasua, who spent six months in Nukulau Prison for coup- related convictions, went public with allegations that financial backers of the coup had tried to hire him to blow up Nadi airport while the then-Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry was passing through. Police completed the investigation into Navakasuasua's alleged plot to kidnap Prime Minister Chaudhry on 28 April 2000, during a major public demonstration in Suva organized by the opposition Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT). This file, concerning four people who allegedly planned the intended kidnapping and assassination, had been forwarded to the DPP, Hughes said. The alleged plot to blow up Nadi Airport, as well as the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) transformer at Wailekutu and three businesses, was still being investigated, Hughes said. Three suspects had already been convicted, two of them in relation to the Wailekutu FEA Transformer, he said, and six remained to be interviewed, four of them concerning the transformer. Hughes said that investigations were also in progress on a new claim that there were plans to execute six members of the Chaudhry government during the coup crisis. Six of the suspects have already been convicted of other treason-related charges. The Commissioner revealed that 8 of the 14 people alleged to have been involved in the plot and execution of the coup had been dealt with already, and two had been granted immunity from prosecution. Hughes revealed on 31 January 2006 that four suspects had been interviewed concerning the alleged Nadi Airport plot, and that the police were almost ready to forward a set of files to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Two suspects remained to be interviewed, the Fiji Times said on 4 February 2006, quoting Hughes. =4. Investigations into the supporters of George Speight= The fourth investigation concerns Navakasuasua's claim that George Speight, who publicly presented himself as the instigator of the coup, was in fact an agent who had been hired at the last minute and had gone on to usurp the leadership. The investigation into this was complete, Hughes said, and had been passed to the DPP. =5. The revelations of Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula= The fifth investigation concerns claims made by Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula, who accused former Prime Minister Rabuka of involvement in the mutiny that had taken place at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November. Rabuka had allegedly tried to take civilians into the barracks for use as human shields. Seruvakula also alleged that he had been offered almost US$ to support the coup but after a face to face questioning from Speight whilst on a visit to Nukulau island he blamed the media for the rumours. He left for New Zealand in 2001 after reporting to the police the names of several present and former Military officers including Bainimarama, whom he claimed to have had prior knowledge of the coup. Hughes revealed that three files had been forwarded to the DPP; one remained with the DPP, but two had been returned to the police for further investigation. Radio Legend reported on 26 January 2006 that \\"a prominent politician\\", whom it did not name, was expected to be charged soon for him alleged involvement in the planning of the mutiny. This politician had allegedly approached Seruvakula and tried to influence him to support the plot, which was aimed at assassinating Commodore Bainimarama. Investigators were reported to have confirmed that the politician's file had been forwarded to the DPP. Fiji Live reported on 23 February 2006 that Hughes was to meet the Director of Public Prosecutions to discuss the investigations into Rabuka's alleged involvement in the coup and mutiny. The file was now with the office of the DPP, according to police spokeswoman Sylvia Low. =6. Investigations into civil servants who allegedly took part in the coup= The sixth investigation was into a number of civil servants who had allegedly assisted the planning or the execution of the coup. Investigations into some civil servants had been completed, Hughes revealed, and would be forwarded to the DPP by the end of January. On 4 February 2006, the Fiji Times quoted Hughes as saying they were awaiting the return from the DPP office of the file related to a former senior civil servant who was alleged to have been involved in the coup plot. Two major companies were involved with the civil servant, Hughes said. A total of four files relating to civil servants had been forwarded to the office of the DPP; two remained with the office, but one had been returned to the police owing to lack of evidence. =7. The Seaqaqa farm arson= The seventh investigation concerns the burning of the Matailakeba Cane Farm in Seaqaqa, on 29 July 2000, a property owned by Ratu Mara. Speaking under Parliamentary Privilege, Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau (Mara's daughter) accused Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, the Tui Cakau (Paramount Chief of Tovata), leader of the Conservative Alliance (CAMV) and a Cabinet Minister (who has since served a prison sentence for other coup-related offences) of having ordered the arson. The arson attack had destroyed three farmhouses and a vehicle belonging to Ratu Mara. Hughes revealed that evidence had been gathered against a Senator, eight rebel soldiers, and a civilian, and that the file would be submitted to the DPP by the end of the month. The Fiji Village news service reported on 24 January 2006 that police spokesman Josaia Rasiga, Director of the Criminal Investigations Department, had confirmed that files had been sent to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine charges against a number of \\"prominent people,\\" whom Fiji Village did not name. One of these was reported to be \\"a prominent politician from the North.\\" Other investigations In addition to the seven major investigations in progress at the beginning of 2006, a number of other investigations have either been completed or are being or have been considered. =Alleged plot to kidnap Commander= The Fiji Live news service reported on 26 January 2006 that charges were pending against a politician and two former senior officers in the Fijian Military, in connection with an alleged plot to kidnap Commodore Bainimarama during the 2000 coup crisis. It did not name the alleged culprits. Members of the 3 FIR Unit, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula allegedly foiled a plot by rebel soldiers, who supported the armed takeover of Parliament by George Speight, to kidnap Bainimarama at Nadi International Airport on his return from Poland soon after the seizure of the parliamentary complex. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that Lieutenant Colonel Jim Koroi had conducted an investigation with the police into the plot. The investigation was nearing completion, and charges would soon be laid, he indicated. However, this story was later discovered to be fabricated by the military to gain the support of the media. =Anonymous threats against government officials= On 6 June, Prime Minister Qarase, his chief executive Joji Kotobalavu, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale and Home Affairs chief executive Lesi Korovavala claimed to have received anonymous threats by telephone. A government source the next day claimed that military officers were implicated in the threats, as a military vehicle had been seen in the vicinity of Bale's home at the time, and that men believed to be soldiers had come to his premises. This allegation which drew a strong reaction from Captain Leweni. \\"Why do they think it's us? We don't see any reason why we should stoop that low,\\" Leweni declared. Police responded the next day by increasing security arrangements for the four officials, and by launching an investigation into the threats. Captain Leweni promised that the military would not interfere with the investigation in any way. On 23 June, Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes said that the police had yet to interview Qarase or Bale, and were still waiting to study records from Telecom Fiji and Vodafone Fiji. He refused to comment on whether or not they had identified the vehicle seen near Bale's home. Kevueli Bulamainaivalu, the Assistant Police Commissioner for Crime, publicly questioned on 27 October why the Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP) was taking so long to charge the person, believed to be a senior civil servant, who was identified as having made the threatening calls. Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola also criticized the DPP for the delay on 26 January 2006, saying that it raised questions about the integrity of the DPP. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes said on 31 January that the investigation was complete, and that the evidence had been forwarded to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It would be up to the DPP, Joe Naigulevu, to make a final decision to charge the individual implicated. The DPP announced on 3 February that the case would be dropped for lack of evidence. Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola said he was very disappointed by the decision. =Alleged plot against Ratu Iloilo= * See main article: Alleged plot against Ratu Iloilo, 2000. Police spokeswoman Sylvia Low announced on 25 August that they were considering opening an investigation into allegations made the previous day by the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, that Senator Apisai Tora and a number of others had approached him in the Fijian Holdings boardroom during the 2000 crisis and asked him to remove from office President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Tora denied the allegations, and was supported by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who said that he had been present at the alleged meeting and that no such discussion had taken place. It was confirmed on 27 August that the investigation would go ahead. =Temple arson investigation= On 26 August 2005, Hughes revealed that the police were conducting a full investigation into arson attacks against Hindu temples and other buildings in Fiji's Western Division during the 2000 crisis. Hughes said that \\"senior politician\\" who featured prominently in the earlier Rabuka coups of 1987 was the main suspect. This politician, whom he did not name, refused to comment when questioned by investigators, but said that the police were gathering evidence that he was indeed involved in the arson. The politician's relevant telephone conversations were being checked, Hughes said. =Ligairi investigation called for= On 28 October 2005, Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry called for an investigation into the newly formed Ronin High Risk Security Company founded by Ilisoni Ligairi, a former commander of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit. Ligairi was the chief security adviser to coup frontman George Speight during the 2000 crisis, and one of his co-directors, Major Isimeli Uluilakeba, is also currently under investigation by the Military for his alleged involvement in the coup. Chaudhry said that it was important that anybody setting up a security firm should have \\"clean credentials,\\" and that there could be a sinister purpose behind the registration of the firm. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni confirmed on 4 November that Uluilakeba was still under investigation. Ligairi denied that the firm was a threat to national security. He said he had set up the firm because of his experience in the area of security, and because it would create employment. On 30 October, the Fiji Sun reported that state witness Salesi Tuifagalele had complained of having received threatening telephone calls from Ronin Security. In an earlier interview, Tuifagalele had identified himself as one of the martial arts experts party to the plot to kidnap former President Ratu Mara, revealed by co-conspirator Maciu Navakasuasua. Tuifagalele also claimed that Jona Vida, another martial arts expert implicated in the plot, been informed by Military Intelligence about threats to his life from Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit officers imprisoned on coup-related offences. He alleged that Ronin Security was connected with the imprisoned officers making the threats. He said that he and Vida were worried for their families' safety. The whole saga surrounding Ronin security was later discovered to be a deliberate attempt by the military to discredit the company and all the claims made by Tuifagalele and Vida, both of whom are martial arts expert were part of that conspiracy. Calls to halt investigations Samisoni Tikoinasau (sometimes known as Sam Speight, Jr.), a Cabinet Minister and elder brother of imprisoned coup frontman George Speight, spoke out on 22 December 2005 to call for a halt to investigations into the planning and financing of the coup. The investigations were pointless, he said, and a distraction from the rebuilding of the nation. The details of the 2000 coup were well known, the perpetrators had been punished, and \\"it should end there,\\" he considered. The ongoing investigations were creating \\"instability\\" and undermining the confidence of investors, he alleged. He clarified, however, that his party would \\"try not to interfere with their (police) work.\\" Hughes denies interference On 25 January 2006, Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes denied claims that there had been interference with the police investigations into the coup. The government had never pressured the police he said, and promised to ensure that such behaviour would never be accepted. The 2006 coup In 2006, the Fijian Military again overthrew the government and dismissed Hughes from his position as Commissioner of Police. He was thus unable to continue with investigating the 2000 coup, and his successors have shown little inclination to do so.

Claymore is located 54 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. The majority of housing in Claymore is owned by Housing NSW. The streets are named after Australian artists.  History  The area now known as Claymore was originally home to the Tharawal people. British settlers began moving into the area in the early 19th century, establishing farms and orchards. By the 1970s, the expansion of Sydney was great enough for developers to look at the area around Campbelltown. The Housing Commission of New South Wales undertook a large public housing development in the Claymore area. Originally the suburb was to be called Badgally after a local homestead, but the council backed off over concerns that the \\"Bad\\" part of the name could give the area a \\"bad\\" name. They chose Claymore after another local property, although that was also contentious since the name had very little history in the area. The first residents moved in during 1978.  Demographics  According to the 2016 census, Claymore had a population of 2,644 people. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.9% of the population. * 57.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 5.1% and Samoa 4.3%. * 56.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Samoan at 9.1%. * The median age is 23, compared to the national median of 38, with 33.2% of the population aged 14 or under. * The median household income is $698 per week, less than half of the national average median of $1,486. * 94.4% of houses were rented, compared to the national average of 30.9%.

Professional baseball career Bauman debuted in professional baseball with the Newport Dodgers in the Northeast Arkansas League in 1941. Hitting only three home runs in 59 games, he also went 0‚Äì10 as a pitcher when he was called up to the Little Rock Travelers in the Southern Association. During the winter of 1942, he played semi-professional ball. He served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1945, and was stationed at Naval Air Station Norman, where he taught physical fitness and played baseball. During that time, he married his high school sweetheart Dorothy and lived in Oklahoma. Upon his return in 1946, Bauman settled in with the Amarillo Gold Sox in the West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League. He led the circuit with 48 home runs, 159 runs batted in, and a .301 batting average. The following season, his home run totals went down, but his production went up. He hit just 38 homers, but he batted .350 and drew 151 walks, and was signed by the Boston Braves. In 1948, Bauman played in the Braves organization, going 0 for 1 in Class AAA with the Milwaukee Brewers, and posting fair stats with the Class AA Hartford Chiefs (.275, 55 BB, 10 HR in 276 AB), while splitting time with Ray Sanders . It was Bauman's only time outside of the low minors, and left it inconclusive as to whether he could play in the majors or not. The Braves tried to send him to the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association but wanted to cut his salary. After four years in the U.S. Navy, Bauman was tired of taking orders and walked away. \\"I told them that I could make more money selling 24-inch shoestrings on any corner in Oklahoma City\\", he said. During this era in baseball, most major leaguers did not make much money. Bauman returned to Oklahoma in 1949, signing on for three seasons with the semi-pro Elk City Elks. He also opened a service station on busy U.S. Highway 66 with business partner Jack Riley. The Elks did well, especially in 1949 and 1950, and Bauman was a crowd favorite, known simply as \\"Joe.\\" Fans from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle flocked to watch him knock home runs over the unique red rock wall of Ackley Park. By 1951, the oil-boom economy and the team had begun to lag, though, and Bauman decided to move on. At 30, Bauman joined up with the Class C Longhorn League for 1952, signing with the Artesia Drillers. During that year, his triple crown stats were .375-50-157, good enough to lead the league in homers, RBI, and walks (148). The next year, he led the league in walks (130), runs scored (135), and home runs (53), while maintaining a high average. After the season, he moved to Roswell. The Roswell Rockets' ballpark had a right field wall that was 329 feet from home. It was a prime target for Bauman, who was a left- handed pull hitter with an uppercut swing. In 1954, Bauman won the triple crown and also led the league in runs and walks for Roswell. In 138 games, he had 199 hits in 498 at bats for a .400 average. He also drove in 228 runs and walked 150 times. He hit 35 doubles, 3 triples, and 72 home runs ‚Äì the latter, a professional baseball record that stood until Barry Bonds topped it in 2001. The previous record had been 69, and Bauman hit 13 home runs in the last 14 games to break the mark. He also became the first professional player to hit 50 in three straight seasons. \\"That summer the ball looked this big,\\" he later said, circling an area the size of a ripe cantaloupe with his hands. Roswell was a small town, and Bauman was the biggest local attraction since the 1947 crash and suspected alien landing. After each home run, fans pushed dollar bills through the fence, and the game had to be stopped for a few minutes to collect all the money. Bauman could not duplicate his 1954 season in 1955, hitting 46 home runs with a batting average of .336. The following season, he played just 52 games and hit 17 homers. He retired in 1956 at age 34. For his professional baseball career, Bauman's statistics were: 1,019 games, 982 runs scored, 1,166 hits, 337 home runs, 1,057 runs batted in, 974 walks, and a .337 batting average. Between his contracts, his business, and the cash fans gave him for home runs, Bauman made more money than some major league players. However, he always wondered if he could have made the majors himself if he had not spent three years of his career playing semi-pro ball. Later life and legacy After his baseball career, Bauman continued to run the service station which he had started operating during the last years of his playing career. He lived in Roswell and died there on September 20, 2005. He was survived by his wife Dorothy. The Joe Bauman Home Run Award is given out annually since 2002 to the minor league baseball player with the most home runs. See also: Minor League Baseball#Awards. Science fiction writer Harry Turtledove made Bauman the central character of his humorous short story \\"The Star and the Rockets\\". The longtime ballpark in Roswell, in which Bauman played, is now named Joe Bauman Baseball Stadium. The address is 900 Block East Poe Roswell, New Mexico, 88201.

The Ottawa Board of Education (OBE) was the public school board for Ottawa from 1970 to 1998. The board was created as part of a province-wide reorganization of the public education system. Previously, elementary schools had been supervised by the Ottawa Public Board of Education, while secondary schools had been managed by the Ottawa Collegiate Board. As a result of The Fewer School Boards Act, both boards were merged with the Rockcliffe Park and Vanier boards, to form the OBE. From 1976 to 1986 the school board lost over 10,000 students. A report on its English-language high schools issued in 1985 recommended four closures. By 1986 the school board only closed two of them. The OBE opposed transfers of its campuses to the Ottawa Separate School Board.Campbell, Cathy. \\"School closings only first round; now school transfer fight begins.\\" Ottawa Citizen.

They also offer Home Internet services in select areas of Ontario and Quebec. Launched on March 1, 2005 as a joint venture between Virgin Group and BCE Inc., BCE took sole ownership on July 1, 2009 when it closed a deal to purchase the stake it did not already own. Virgin Mobile calls its customers 'Members' and offers a Member Benefits program, which provides its customers with special offers, discounts, and VIP experiences. History Pre-launch (2003-2004) = The VirginMobile.ca domain name was registered by Virgin Enterprises Limited on July 4, 2003 with the Canadian Internet Registration Authority. When accessed, it displayed a domain parking page until June 14, 2004, when it was replaced with an announcement. There were also links to information about the company, related news articles, and career opportunities. Virgin Mobile claimed: \\"we work like maniacs to bring you Canada‚Äôs most awesome mobile phone company.\\"Virgin Mobile Canada official website on June 16, 2004. = Launch (2005-2007) = VMC launch stunt Virgin Mobile launched in Canada on March 1, 2005 as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using the Bell Mobility network. At the time, Virgin Mobile was operating solely as a prepaid service. The company's website showcased several feature phones it offered, and advertised itself as a \\"no catch\\" mobile operator.Virgin Mobile Canada official website on March 3, 2005. Virgin Mobile Canada was the first mobile carrier in Canada to launch without a system access fee. The company's ‚Äúno catch‚Äù campaign at launch featured cheeky advertisements likening existing Canadian mobile carriers as ‚Äúthe catch‚Äù, and Virgin Mobile Canada as the cure to unclear contracts and undesirable hidden fees. Sir Richard Branson helped create excitement at launch by zip-lining from a high-rise building into Yonge-Dundas Square in a superhero costume, and drove a monster truck over three cars symbolizing ‚ÄúThe Big Three‚Äù mobile carriers in Canada ‚Äì Rogers, Telus, and Bell. Since its launch, Virgin Mobile has used edgy and controversial advertising, leading to demands for an apology, requests to cease and desist the advertising, and even boycotts. This marketing technique is still used by Virgin Mobile Canada to this day. = Postpaid services introduced (2008) = In February 2008, Virgin Mobile Canada launched postpaid wireless service. To promote and encourage Canadians to consider the new postpaid service, the company released a new slogan, \\"It's Better to Be a Member\\". At launch, this was known as 'myPlan', and the company offered a multitude of options, including the ability to set one's own timeframe for unlimited calling, as opposed to the windows generally offered by competing mobile companies. Since then, postpaid plans have become a popular choice for new and existing Members, and plans continue to evolve in the highly competitive telecom market. = Acquisition by Bell Mobility, brand re- positioning, HSPA+ and SuperTab (2009-2010) = sim fashion show On July 1, 2009, Bell Mobility acquired 50% of Virgin Mobile Canada that it previously did not own for $142 million and entered into a long-term agreement to use the Virgin brand. Following this, Bell greatly reduced its investments into Solo Mobile in order to invest in and improve its new Virgin brand. On December 21, 2009, Virgin Mobile Canada's then-president Robert Blumenthal promised \\"a very different Virgin Mobile\\" with \\"higher-value devices and services\\" in 2010. Virgin Mobile officially launched HSPA+ services on February 2, 2010. This was promoted with a ‚ÄúSIM Fashion Show‚Äù launch event featuring Victoria's Secret models. The company launched HSPA+ with several phones, including the BlackBerry Bold 9700, BlackBerry Curve 8530, the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, MiFi and Samsung M330. A Broadband2Go USB mobile broadband modem was also part of the launch lineup. To prepare for the back-to-school season of that year, the Virgin Mobile SuperTab was introduced on August 23 as a response to competition from other providers, especially Koodo Mobile. The SuperTab was only available to postpaid Members, while HSPA+ products and services were unavailable to prepaid Members until around spring in 2011. = Member Benefits Launch, Unlimited plans and Galaxy Nexus exclusivity (2010-2011) = To differentiate itself from other mobile providers, Virgin Mobile Canada launched its Member Benefits program in 2010. This program is available to all Postpaid and Prepaid Members and provides exclusive discounts and VIP experiences with many well-known brands in the fashion, travel, music, and entertainment space. Since launch, the program has grown and offers exclusive offers for its Members. In response to competition from major mobile brands and new entrants, Virgin Mobile introduced a City Unlimited plan on February 18, 2011. Later that year, in order to imitate Koodo Mobile's pricing, Virgin Mobile reduced Canadian long-distance charges, eventually eliminating them altogether. For the same reason, a plan with unlimited Canadian long-distance minutes was launched by Virgin, priced identically to Koodo's equivalent offering. The carrier is notable for being one of Canada's two carriers to exclusively carry the Galaxy Nexus smartphone for the country's Christmas and holiday season of 2011. Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile's parent, also has this exclusivity during that time period. The flagship device from the Google Nexus series is the first in the world to run the Android 4 operating system. On November 29, Virgin Mobile invited its Members to join the Galaxy Nexus Tester Team. Each Member in this team of five received a complimentary Galaxy Nexus, but they had to tweet about their experiences with the device. The smartphone was launched on December 8, and the five Tester Team members were chosen on the following day. Other Canadian carriers sold the Galaxy Nexus in 2012. = SIM-only promotion and LTE (2012) = On January 9, 2012, Virgin Mobile Canada launched a limited time promotion where postpaid customers who activated only a SIM card during that month would obtain an ongoing $5/month discount when they subscribed to any talk and text plan. Those with a smartphone plan would receive an ongoing $10/month discount instead. On January 25, 2013, Virgin Mobile Canada introduced \\"Bring Your Own Phone (BYOP)\\" which allows members to bring their own phone, get a Virgin Mobile SIM card, and receive 10% off their monthly rate every month on a 30 Day Term. In conjunction with the launch of the third-generation iPad, Virgin Mobile Canada customers were able to access Bell Mobility's LTE network. Postpaid phones are available with LTE. The 4G LTE network provides peak speeds up to 75 Mbit/s, with expected average speeds of 12 ‚Äì 25 Mbit/s. Outside 4G LTE coverage areas, customers fall back to the 3G HSPA+ network. = Tiered plans, two-year agreements and Wireless Code of Conduct (2013-present) = On August 1, 2013, Virgin Mobile Canada discontinued its SuperTab proposition, and introduced a new Silver, Gold, and Platinum Plan proposition where all plans are only available on 30 Day (monthly) terms or 2 Year Agreements. This allows Members to choose a rate plan level to receive a higher or lower subsidy when they activate a new phone with Virgin Mobile. At launch, Silver Plans offered Members a $150 subsidy on their new phone, Gold Plans offered Members a $250 subsidy on their new phone, and Platinum offered a $500 subsidy on their new phone. Since then, the subsidy offering has evolved to offer Members up to $200 off the retail price of their phone on Silver Plans, up to $300 off the retail price of their phone with Gold Plans, and up to $700 off the retail price of their phone with Platinum Plans. On November 6, 2013, Virgin Mobile became Wireless Code of Conduct compliant before the deadline given to all mobile carriers in Canada by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Networks Virgin Mobile customers use Bell Mobility's LTE, HSPA+ and CDMA networks. Previously, Virgin Mobile customers only had access to Bell's CDMA network.  Phones  Featured manufacturers = Virgin Mobile offers smartphones from the following manufacturers, available on the HSPA+ and LTE network. They can be activated on either a prepaid or a postpaid plan: * ZTE * Apple * Google * Samsung * HTC * Motorola * Alcatel * LG * Huawei  Services  Various services are offered by Virgin Mobile for both prepaid and postpaid customers. = Voice = Since its inception, Virgin Mobile Canada offers a prepaid plan that has no monthly fee. Customers paid only for the services they used, such as per-minute billing for local calling or per-message fee for each SMS sent. Virgin Mobile never charged for received messages, and this practice remains effective to this day. Long-distance calls to Canada or the United States were charged at double the local airtime rate. The $15 top up voucher expires after 30 days, while the $25 and then $50 are valid for two months. The most popular voucher option for Pay Per Use members is the $100 voucher which is valid for 365 days. Any account that has not been topped up or remains inactive for 120 days will be automatically deactivated and the phone number will be reassigned to new members activating their prepaid cell phones. There are also prepaid monthly plans and add-ons available at Virgin Mobile. The initial pay-per-use rates, however, have drastically increased over time. For example, Virgin Mobile eliminated talk time discounts previously available for customers who talked for more than five minutes in a day. In Q4 2012, Virgin Mobile added a prepaid incentive: for every six months of payments on a plan costing $20/month or more, Virgin Mobile will allow that Member to add unlimited local calling to any one regular number. Until Q1 2013, Virgin Mobile Canada had two types of postpaid plans: Choice and Combo. The Choice category was low-end and only included talk and text, while Combo was high-end and added mobile Internet access. On January 25, 2013, Virgin Mobile renamed Choice to Silver and Combo to Platinum. A third plan type, Gold, was also added on that day. This category is considered mid-range. Virgin Mobile changed its focus to postpaid plans since 2008. Virgin Mobile Canada still has a few minor distinctions which make some of its plans unique. For example, Virgin Mobile's plans allowed Members to choose either the caller ID and voicemail calling features or the SMS and MMS messaging features. More recently, Canada-Wide minutes, Voicemail & Caller ID, Unlimited International Text Messaging, and Unlimited Picture and Text Messaging to Canada and the US are built into all postpaid plans. = Mobile Internet = All talk and text plans automatically include pay-per-use data, a flexible mobile broadband add- on imitating Koodo's pricing for its \\"Data Saver\\" add-on. Initially branded as Commitment-Free Data, Virgin Mobile was innovative in that it was the first to charge $0 for the add-on. Koodo customers, on the other hand, previously had to pay for their data add-on even if unused for a month. Currently, the Silver rate plan level includes a variety of plans both with either Pay Per use data or built-in data to appeal to different user lifestyles. Those with a BlackBerry running OS 7.1 or lower, using Virgin Mobile cannot obtain Pay Per Use Data. Instead, Virgin Mobile offers unlimited BBM at no extra charge with certain monthly plans. Customers have the option to charge BlackBerry App World downloads or the BBM Music service directly on their Virgin Mobile bill. = Television = As of June 2020 Virgin Mobile offers Internet Television services wherever their internet services are available in Ontario and Quebec. A Virgin Mobile Television package must be paired with an unlimited Virgin Mobile internet package capable of 15Mbit/s or higher bandwidth speeds. Service is facilitated through an internet connection and does not function as a traditional Television service. Virgin Mobile TV is accessed through an app as opposed to a set-top box.https://www.google.ca/aclk?sa=l&ai;=DChcSEwj3wYaA4ObqAhUJi8gKHU6TATEYABAAGgJxdQ&sig;=AOD64_25VNo5oZGvJ53C2nKvuJp9JKf2LA&q;=&ved;=2ahUKEwjDyP3_3-bqAhXpoXIEHYsXCT8Q0Qx6BAgOEAE&adurl;= Unlike Bell Fibe there are no quality of service guarantees as no bandwidth is dedicated for video which can use up to 850Mb per hour of bandwidth for standard quality.https://www.virginmobile.ca/en/support/step-by-step-tv- tutorials.html?g=virgin-mobile-tv-android&p;=1&province;=ON&geoResult;=failed Some channels are available from anywhere in Canada while the majority are only available when connected to the customers home internet connection. =Member Benefits, Events & Sponsorship= Since 2010, Virgin Mobile Canada offers a \\"Member Benefits \\" loyalty program to Members. This allows Virgin Mobile Canada Members access exclusive contests, discounts, other one-of-a- kind opportunities. Categories originally included only four pillars: music, entertainment, fashion, travel. However, the program has evolved to include more partnerships that provide value for Members, but fall outside of these categories, such as food offers from Pizza Pizza, and New York Fries. On February 2, 2011, the brand announced a partnership with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The following month, Virgin Mobile partnered with H&M.; In June of that same year, Flight Centre began offering exclusive discounts to Virgin Mobile Members. Numerous other partners have been added over time, such as New York Fries, The Body Shop and Zipcar. Cineplex Entertainment, and Porter Airlines were added in May 2012, and while current Cineplex offers are only valid for new Cineplex Scene customers, the cinema chain announced future deals for existing customers as well. In 2013 & 2014, more new partners have come on board, including Banana Republic, Warner Bros. Entertainment, G Adventures, and Dynamite. Virgin Mobile presents Squamish Valley Music Festival (2013) Virgin Mobile Canada also sponsors several nationally recognized events & creates unique experiences and opportunities for Members. For example, Virgin Mobile Canada sponsors the Virgin Mobile presents Osheaga Musique Festival et Arts in Montreal, QC, Virgin Mobile Stampede Concert Series at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary, AB, and Virgin Mobile presents Squamish Valley Music Festival in Squamish Valley, BC. Virgin Mobile offers Members the opportunity to enter contests on the Member Benefits webpage to win VIP experiences at these events. Virgin Mobile sponsors the music venues Virgin Mobile Mod Club in Toronto, ON and Virgin Mobile Corona Theatre in Montreal, QC. Retail presence VM Kiosk Since its inception, Virgin Mobile Canada has its own dedicated retail kiosks. Such booths are usually located in the middle of a mall hall, but can sometimes be found in its own corner or built as a mini-store. Virgin Mobile products cannot be purchased at Bell corporate stores, and vice versa. The two brands remain separate, despite sharing a common owner. On June 10, 2011, Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson and Glee star Cory Monteith celebrated the opening of Virgin Mobile Canada's first street-front store, located in Montreal, Quebec. A few days later, on June 17, a second Virgin store was built inside the MuchMusic headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. This store is called \\"Virgin Mobile at Much\\". The third retail store was opened in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Starting Q3 2012, select Virgin Mobile Canada retail locations became what are known as 'Service Lounges', A Service Lounge offers live, in person Warranty Support and can accept broken devices eligible for repair under the Virgin Mobile Standard Warranty Program in addition to issuing 'Loaner Devices'. In Q4 2012, Virgin Mobile Canada also started offering an extended warranty program called 'Virgin Smart Care' (VSC). As of October 2018, there are three tiers of VSC: Plus $6/month (mobile phones & select smartphones), Premium $9/month (mobile phones, select smartphones & tablets), Premium $12/month (premium select smartphones & tablets).

Clovelly is located 8 kilometres south- east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick, within the Federal Division of Wentworth. Clovelly is a mainly residential suburb on Clovelly Bay. Clovelly Beach is a small beach that sits on the end of the narrow bay. Clovelly Beach was closed in March, 2020 because of COVID-19. The bay is popular with swimmers. The bay is home to one of the first surf lifesaving clubs in the world, Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club, which was founded in 1906. Clovelly is surrounded by the suburbs of Bronte in the north, Randwick in the west and Coogee in the south. History Clovelly Cove beach. Originally known as Little Coogee, the name was changed to Clovelly in 1913. When the search for a new name began, the English seaside town Eastbourne, was suggested. The president of the local progress association, Mr F H Howe, suggested Clovelly, the name of a local estate owned by Sir John Robertson, which was named after the village of Clovelly on the north Devon coast, England.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 64 William C. Greville bought , which included the whole bay frontage, for 40 pounds in 1834. The area was dominated during the nineteenth century by the grand estate of Mundarrah Towers. Mundarrah Towers was built for Dr Dickson in the 1860s. Samuel Bennett, who owned Australian Town and Country Journal, one of the most influential newspapers of the day, bought the property and made further grand additions. The Towers was demolished in 1926, to make way for suburban development. The Mundarrah Towers estate occupied the land around Burnie Street overlooking the western end of Clovelly Bay. Mundarrah Street honours this once grand part of Clovelly's heritage. Between Coogee and Clovelly, on the shores of Gordon's Bay, stood Cliffbrook, the home built for John Thompson. By the early twentieth century the first governor of the Commonwealth Bank owned this grand mansion which was substantially demolished in 1976. Some of the buildings of the Cliffbrook estate survive today at the corner of Beach and Battery streets. Now controlled by the University of New South Wales, these buildings were until the early 2000s occupied by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Clovelly Hotel Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club Between 1871 & 1874, the northern cliff-face of Clovelly Beach, known as Shark Point, was the site of a coastal defence facility excavated from the sandstone to include barracks, a powder magazine and eventually in 1893, a 9.2-inch Mark VI British Armstrong \\"disappearing\\" gun. The subterranean barracks and gun emplacement were gradually demolished in the 1960s. This emplacement formed part of three gun emplacements originally designed to protect Sydney Harbour from a supposed Russian seaboard assault. Steel Point Battery A public infants school was operating in Little Coogee as early as 1897, in the Mission Hall of the Church of England in Varna Street. Eliza McDonnell was the teacher with an average attendance of 76 pupils. Clovelly Public School officially dates from 1913 when the Department of Education provided permanent accommodation for a public school in Arden Street, Clovelly. Major subdivisions for domestic housing commenced in earnest in Clovelly in 1909. The local progress association argued that there were 717 houses constructed within metres of the proposed tram route that had not yet been completed. Due to these lobbying efforts, the tram-line to Clovelly was completed between 1912‚Äì1913. This allowed Clovelly to continue developing throughout the 1920s. During the Great Depression Randwick Council instituted a scheme to keep unemployed men employed by building concrete foreshores for Clovelly in an attempt to make access to the bay's foreshores easier for bathers. The Council envisaged an Olympic size swimming pool in the bay, a facility that would also keep local men employed in the worst financial times. It was also planned to build a causeway/scenic road across the entrance to the Bay but wild storms in 1938 dashed hopes of this. The remains of the causeway are still visible at low tide, forming a protective reef. The plans were controversial; the merits of this work are still debated today. In 1907, a surf life saving brigade was formed at Clovelly, inaugurating the surf life saving tradition in this suburb that has seen numerous heroic rescues, including \\"the rescue off Schnapper\\" or \\"the big rescue\\" of Sunday 4 December 1927. Surf Life Saving has been a predominate part of the culture and heritage of this scenic coastal suburb. Competitive swimming is also a dominant part of life in this idyllic coastal location. Today the suburb is affectionately referred to as \\"Cloey\\" by many residents and locals. =Trams= The Clovelly tram line began at Alison Road to the intersection of Clovelly and Carrington Roads in 1912, then extending to Clovelly in 1913 helping to popularise the area. This line branched from Anzac Parade at Alison Road, and ran on its own tram reservation beside Centennial Park as far as Darley Road. Here it diverged from services to Coogee, to run north along Darley Road, then turned right into Clovelly Road to run down to its terminus at Clovelly Beach. Though services ran from Circular Quay and from Railway Square (from 1923). the line closed in 1957.Pictorial History of Randwick, Lawrence J, Kingsclear Books, Alexandria, 2001, pp.36-39 The tram line followed the current route of bus 339. Commercial area Clovelly has four small shopping precincts all on or near Clovelly Road. The largest is at the corner of Fern St and Clovelly where there (amongst other businesses) a post office, community bank, chemist, newsagent and bottle shop. At the corner of Arden St and Clovelly Road is another small precinct including another newsagent. At the corner of Carrington and Clovelly Road there are a handful of shops. Close to Clovelly Beach there are shops in a small precinct where Burnie St meets Clovelly Road. There is one beachside hotel, the Clovelly Hotel built on some of the land once occupied by the Mundarrah Towers estate and the Clovelly Bowling Club, with coastal views and located on leased public land bordering the Waverley Cemetery. Schools * Clovelly Public School * St Anthony's Catholic Systemic Primary School, Clovelly Sport and recreation In summer, Clovelly Beach is a centre of community activity patrolled by council lifeguards on weekdays and Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club members on weekends/public holidays.

Many of those tried include Cabinet Minister, parliamentarians, and others who have links to the present government, which has come under criticism from some quarters for releasing on parole some of the persons convicted. Strained relationships among some of Fiji's senior judges have raised some concerns about the conduct of the trials. The Fiji Sun claimed on 3 November 2005 that documents in their possession revealed that three Justices ‚Äì Nazhat Shameem, Anthony Gates and John Byrne ‚Äì had written to Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki asking that Justice Michael Scott be excluded from any Supreme Court panel hearing appeals against any of their cases, saying that Scott had exercised \\"extreme hostility\\" toward them ever since the upheaval of 2000.

Shameem unsuccessfully applied to have Scott excluded from the panel hearing the appeal of former Senator Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, who was convicted by Shameem of coup-related offences. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes revealed on 4 January 2006 that 782 individuals had been charged and convicted for 28 types of offences in relation to the coup. Timoci Silatolu and Josefa Nata Timoci Silatolu, sometimes known as Ratu Timoci Silatolu, and Josefa Nata, were convicted of treason on 21 March 2003. They were sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 9 years for Silatolu and 7 years for Nata. Silatolu, a disgruntled back-bench MP in the Chaudhry government, had made a crucial telephone call on the day of the coup, alerting his to-conspirators that the time was right for it, and was subsequently appointed to George Speight's rebel cabinet, first as Prime Minister then as Deputy Prime Minister after Speight himself claimed the office. Justice Andrew Wilson found that Silatolu and Nata, a journalist, had told many lies in their defence. In June that year, the pair were sentenced to life imprisonment. They had earlier rejected plea bargaining, refusing an offer of a seven-year sentence if they pleaded guilty. On 15 July 2005, the Court of Appeal ordered the government to provide Silatolu and Nata with a lawyer for their pending appeal. At a court appearance on 15 September 2005, High Court Justice Gerard Winter refused an application from Silatolu's lawyer, Inoke Josefa, to require the Military to produce the results of an inquiry it had conducted into the 2000 crisis, accepting their objection that it could compromise national security. Silatolu made a second attempt to force the release of the inquiry on 21 October. Meanwhile, the trial has been adjourned until 16 November. He partially reversed this decision on 27 January 2006, however; he would order the documents to be released, he said ‚Äì but only after studying them himself to ensure that they did not threaten national security. Fiji Village quoted Military lawyer Major Ana Rokomokoti on 7 February as saying that the Military would seek a stay order on Winter's decision that he should be allowed to view the documents, which the Military declared to be top secret. On the 8th, Winter gave the Military till the 14th to file affidavits, pending his ruling on the 23rd. On the 23rd, however, a stay order was placed, and it was announced that a decision would be made the following week as to whether the documents could be declassified and used as defence evidence by plaintiffs. Fiji Live reported on 4 March that earlier in the week, Winter had ruled against the Military's request. Winter will now view the documents privately, before deciding whether to make them available to defendants. The Fiji Times reported on 1 March that lawyer Abhay Singh had called for Silatolu and Nata to be given a retrial, accusing Justice Andrew Wilson of having been biased in his judgement. \\"Judge Andrew Wilson was imbalanced in his summing up of the case ... the learned judge made his directions to the assessors on behalf of the prosecution thus influencing the assessors' decisions in that my clients were guilty as charged,\\" he alleged. Justice Gordon Ward in the Court of Appeal dismissed Silatolu and Nata's appeal. Lawyer Abhay Singh announced his intention to lodge a further appeal with the Supreme Court. Ratu Jope Seniloli and Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure On 6 August 2004 Jope Seniloli, the then Vice-President, was convicted of falsely swearing in ministers in 2000, and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, was also convicted and imprisoned for the same offence. Ratu Viliame Volavola, Peceli Rinakama, and Viliame Savu were convicted with them, and sentenced to three-year prison terms. On 25 May 2005, the High Court upheld a decision by the parliamentary Speaker, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, to expel Vakalalabure for nonattendance. Ostensibly for \\"health\\" reasons, Seniloli was paroled on 29 November 2004, having served less than four months of his sentence, generating a storm of protests from the Indo-Fijian dominated opposition and, significantly, from the ethnic Fijian-dominated military. On grounds of good behaviour, Volavola and Rinakama in turn were released on 17 December 2005 to serve the remainder of their sentences extramurally. Apisai Tora On 3 November 2004, Senator Apisai Tora (71), along with 11 other men ‚Äì Peniasi Sabolo (62), Viliame Rakubuli (71), Paula Saukuru (53), Napolioni Vasu (69), Mosese Tuisa (59), Peni Raicebe (60), Vela Tawake (44), Ananaisa Mocei (42), Apenisa Nayate (51), Aca Tuigaloa Sakuru (49) and Kinisimere Qoro (58), and one woman ‚Äì Peniasi Qoro (27) ‚Äì were acquitted in the Nadi Court of charges of unlawful assembly, for allegedly seizing a military checkpoint on Queen's Highway in the Nadi suburb of Sabeto on 13 July 2000. Magistrate Syed Muhktar Shah said he found \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"alarming\\" discrepancies in police statements and court testimonies, and also said that the accused had not been informed of their rights under Fiji's Bill of Rights. The Department of Public Prosecutions filed an appeal, and on 19 September, High Court Justice John Connors overturned Shah's decision to acquit Tora and his accomplices. He remanded them on F$500 bail pending sentencing in the last week of September. On 27 September, Tora was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and his accomplices to four months each. Justice Connors said that the offences were too serious to warrant a suspended sentence or a fine, and a custodial sentenced had to be imposed. He also said that Tora, a Turaga ni Yavusa (tribal chief) had failed in his obligation to set a good example for his people to follow, as had his fellow-accused, who he said were all mature adults and leaders in the community. \\"Those with the authority to lead have an obligation to lead in the right direction and not to encourage others to break the law,\\" Connors said. Tora agreed that he had led his villagers astray, but insisted that he had done so only with a view to getting the attention of the Military and the Great Council of Chiefs, to hasten the appointment of Ratu Josefa Iloilo to the Presidency. He told the court through his lawyer that as he was the one who had led his villagers to commit the offence, he wished to bear the full brunt of the law, and hoped that his fellow-accused would be dealt with leniently. Tora's lawyer, Iqbal Khan, has applied for bail, pending an appeal against the sentence. Senator Ratu Inoke Takiveikata On 23 November 2004, Senator Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, the Qaranivalu (a senior chief) of Naitasiri, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for facilitating the mutiny at Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2000. He was found guilty of giving both moral and practical support to the mutiny, in which four soldiers were killed and four mutineers subsequently beaten to death after the failure of the mutiny. Among other things, he was found to have supplied cellphones to the rebels. Lautoka lawyer Iqbal Khan announced on 30 August 2005 that he had filed an application on behalf of Takiveikata and Vakalalabure, to have their convictions quashed. Khan claimed that the two had been denied a fair trial according to Section 29 of the Constitution of Fiji, as the trial assessors had been handpicked and therefore possibly biased. Filipo Tarakinikini On 5 November 2000, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Phil Goff publicly accused Lieutenant Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, who had served as the Military's principal spokesman during the main events of the coup, of complicity in the mutiny that had taken place four days earlier, leaving eight soldiers dead. Tarakinikini denied the charges, but the Military ordered an investigation. Tarakinikini left Fiji shortly afterwards, to take up a post as a security adviser at the United Nations in New York City. He continues to hold this position as of November 2005, but the Military has continued in its efforts to deport him from the United States to face a court martial in Fiji over the allegations. His resignation from the Army, delivered to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo in 2002, was rejected by the President at the request of the Military commander, Commodore Bainimarama. Tarakinikini is fighting the President's refusal of his resignation in the courts. The trial was supposed to begin on 12 September 2005, but was postponed because Tarakinikini's lawyer, Samuela Matawalu, was recovering from a minor stroke. On 30 November, High Court Justice Gerald Winter scheduled a hearing for 22 February 2006 and ordered Matawalu to file submissions by 16 January, and the President's Office to reply by 17 February. Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu and Senator Ratu Josefa Dimuri The political fallout from the coup continued into 2005. On 3 April 2005, Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu (the Tui Cakau and Minister for Lands and Natural Resources), Senator Ratu Josefa Dimuri, Ratu Rokodewala Niumataiwalu (the Tui Wailevu), and Ratu Viliame Rovabokola (the Tui Nadogo), were convicted of unlawful assembly for having met with the plotters while the coup was in progress, and were imprisoned for eight months. On 14 April, Lalabalavu and Dimuri were released on parole, after having served only eleven days of their eight-month sentence. This provoked an angry reaction from the opposition Fiji Labour Party and from the Citizens Constitutional Forum. Poseci Bune, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, called their release \\"a travesty of justice and made a mockery of the country's judicial system,\\" and accused the government of perverting the course of justice to retain the support of its coalition partner. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional forum concurred, saying that the decision smacked of political interference in the judicial process, showed disrespect to the court, and abused principles of equal treatment. The Fiji Military Forces added its own voice to the criticism on 17 April. In a strongly worded statement, Commodore Frank Bainimarama said that he was \\"frustrated, disturbed, and disappointed\\" by the decision which, he said, \\"made a mockery of the military, police, and the judiciary.\\" He went on to emphasise that he was speaking on behalf of the military, not only for himself. His outburst provoked a strong response from Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola, who warned him that he would face \\"discipline\\" if he did not cease making statements to the media without consulting him. The row escalated, with Bainimarama saying on 19 April that he would not be silenced. Army spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni also issued his own statement supporting Bainimarama's criticism of government policy. Leweni also criticised Aisea Taoka, Fiji's Commissioner of Prisons, for his role in the release of the two chiefs, and also hinted darkly of \\"secret forces in place before the actual release\\" ‚Äì believed to be a veiled reference to political intervention in the course of justice. He said that persons convicted of politically motivated crimes \\"should not be classified as ordinary prisoners\\" and indicated that early release should not be an option for them. On 20 April, Vosanibola said that he would not be \\"intimidated\\" by Bainimarama's comments to the media, and reiterated his threat to take unspecified disciplinary actions against him if he did not cease making public statements without consulting him. A month before their expiry of their sentences, Rovabokola and Niumataiwalu were released on parole on 4 August, to serve the remainder of their sentences extramurally. Poor health and old age (both are over 70) were cited as reasons for their early release. Niumataiwalu suffers from high blood pressure and swelling of the feet, while Rovabokola has heart complications. Tevita Bukarau, Metuisela Mua, Viliame Sausauwai, Eroni Lewaqai, and Joji Bakoso On 27 April 2004, five persons, including Tevita Bukarau, the former chief military lawyer, and Metuisela Mua, former director of the Fiji Intelligence Service, were convicted of consorting with people carrying firearms. They were also found guilty on two counts of unlawful assembly. \\"I am satisfied that each of the accused consorted, that is, 'spent time, associated' and were in harmony with the crowd and with George Speight. They were also in company of persons who were carrying or had possession of arms and ammunitions,\\" declared Magistrate Ajmal Khan. Khan refused bail to the defendants, and remanded them in custody pending sentencing. He rejected their defence that they had gone to the Parliamentary complex and met with Speight to negotiate an end to the crisis. \\"I find they knew [in advance] of the illegal takeover of Parliament by George Speight and his men's activities, and had full knowledge of the guns and hostage situation during the duration of the 19 May to July 2000,\\" Khan said. On 5 May, Khan sentenced Bukarau and Mua, as well as a third defendant, former politician Eroni Lewaqai, to prison terms of two and a half years. Two other defendants, Viliame Sausauwai and Joji Bakoso, received terms of two years and fifteen months, respectively. Lewaqai had been sworn in, illegally, as a Cabinet Minister, while the other two had attended meetings on Speight's executive committee. The five reappeared in court before Justice Nazhat Shameem on 11 July to appeal their sentences. On 17 September, Justice Anthony Gates announced that their appeal would be heard on 14 October, but at their appearance on that date, Justice Shameem agreed to adjourn the hearing to 4 November, as their lawyers were not present. It was subsequently postponed till 8 November. The five appealed on the grounds that there was a five-year interval between their initial arrest and the beginning of the trial. After viewing TV footage of the coup events for clarification, Justice Shameem dismissed the appeal on 18 November, saying that they had received less than the maximum sentence allowed, namely four years imprisonment and a fine of $2000. Fiji Live reported on 27 January 2006 that Mua, Bukarau, and Lewaqai had applied for a Compulsory Supervision Order, meaning in effect that they had applied to be released on parole; the Fiji Sun reported the next day that all five had applied. Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale said that he was awaiting a report from Prisons Commissioner Aisea Taoka before making a decision. Taoka said that he would finalise his report in his own time. \\"The AG will just have to wait because I will not be rushed,\\" the Sun quoted him as saying. Bale told Fiji Live on 20 February that he had received the applications, but declined to comment on whether any decision had been made. On 7 March, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale refused he applications of Mua, Bukarau, Bakoso, and Sausauwai to serve the remainder of their sentences extramurally. Unless released early, the men are due for release in 2007. Simione Kaitani, Levani Tonitonivanua, Eroni Lewaqai, Viliame Sausauwai, and Antonio Tanaburenisau On 23 May 2005, Transport Minister Simione Kaitani appeared in court along with four other defendants, Levani Tonitonivanua, Eroni Lewaqai, Viliame Sausauwai, and Antonio Tanaburenisau on charges of having taken an illegal oath of ministerial office during the coup, on 20 May 2000. Tanaburenisau, who had already admitted the charge on 22 April, apologised. The others, including Kaitani, all pleaded not guilty. The trial of all except Tanaburenisau began on 17 June. A number of witnesses were summoned, among them the Parliamentary Secretary, Mary Chapman, and Senator Mitieli Bulanauca, who was given immunity to testify. On 20 June, former Cabinet Minister Tu'uakitau Cokanauto testified. He, too, had been approached by Speight to join the Taukei Cabinet, he said, but had refused. Former Fiji Television cameraman Trevor Whippy and policewoman Sainimili Cavuilati testified on 7 July. Cavuilati said that she met Lewaqai on 20 May 2000, the day of the coup, and that he told her he had been appointed Assistant Minister for Urban Development in the rebel cabinet. Whippy, for his part, said that he did not see any of the accused taking an oath or signing any documents. On 25 July, Kaitani claimed that he could not remember signing any Oath of Allegiance to be part of Speight's rebel cabinet. In a written statement, he said that he remembered signing many papers, but no oath of office. On 1 August, Kaitani's defence lawyers Iqbal Khan and Rabo Matebalavu called for the charges against Kaitani and his fellow-accused to be dismissed on the grounds that twelve state witnesses who testified, including New Zealand Police handwriting expert David Boot, had failed to conclusively link the accused to their alleged crime. Judge Anthony Gates dismissed the application on 9 August, however, ordering the trial to continue. Also on 9 August, Kaitani filed an unsworn statement in court that he had deliberately remained in the parliamentary complex during the upheaval, not to support the rebels, but to use his skills as a qualified conflict management trainer to calm the situation. \\"In my professional capacity, I simply could not leave the parliamentary complex and watch it being taken over,\\" he said. \\"I decided to take the bull by the horn and remain there.\\" Along with Tonitonivanua, Lewaqai and Sausauwai, he continued to deny having taken an oath or signing an oath. \\"I did not take an oath of allegiance or sign any documents,\\" he declared, adding that the first he knew of his alleged unconstitutional ministerial appointment was from a newspaper. He said that of the ten thousand people who had gathered in the parliamentary complex when the crisis was at its height, not one had seen him taking an oath or signing any documents. He questioned why the three alleged witnesses, including former Vice-President Seniloli, had not been called to give evidence against him. Tonitonivanua said that when the police and army had raided his home with a search warrant, he had told them they could write whatever they wished. Sausauwai, for his part, claimed that the police had extorted a false confession out of him, while Lewaqai complained that he had not been allowed to call his lawyer during the police interview. Lawyers for the accused attacked the credibility of state witnesses, claiming that Boot had failed to prove \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" that the signatures on the ministerial oath forms were those of the accused. In her summing up, however, state prosecutor Ashishna Prasad said that in the course of several police interviews, neither Kaitani nor his fellow accused had denied their involvement in the swearing-in ceremony on 20 May 2000. All of them, she said, had been seen to have spent two minutes in a room with Seniloli, who had been appointed President by Speight, after which they gave one another congratulatory handshakes when they left. She rejected Kaitani's defence that he \\"shook hands with everyone he meets to express the love and affection of God\\", saying it was a clear indication that he had sworn a ministerial oath. She quoted Kaitani as having told the police, \\"Yes, it looks like mine\\" when shown the oath form. She further alleged that Kaitani had insisted on having his name correctly typed on the form where that of Ratu Kinijoji Maivalili, who had declined appointment to the Primary Industries portfolio, had been crossed out. The others had also confirmed their signatures on the document, she said. Five court assessors found Kaitani and his co-accused not guilty on 12 August. Judge Anthony Gates ratified their decision on 15 August. He said that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty of the charges specified. \\"The State's case relied on certain key witnesses as its supporting pillars,\\" Gates said. \\"If the pillars of the case were not ultimately to be relied on, the house which the prosecution sought to build would collapse. This appears to have been the result in this case ... each of the three central pillars of the evidence upon which the prosecution relied, possessed potential and obvious defects ... (that) could properly give rise to reasonable doubt about the guilt of each of the accused.\\" He declared Kaitani and his fellow-accused acquitted. On 16 August, Tanaburenisau was handed a suspended sentence for his admitted taking of an illegal oath of office. Justice Gates sentenced the 57-year-old Tanaburenisau to a two-year prison term, suspended on condition that he remain out of trouble during the term of the sentence. Gates said that Tanaburenisau's role had been a relatively minor one, that he had gotten \\"carried away\\" and had acted without thinking of the consequences to himself or to his fellow-citizens. Gates said that he had taken Tanaburenisau's age into account, along with the fact that he had pleaded guilty, apologised, and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Tanaburenisau thanked the court for the suspended sentence, saying that his offence warranted a custodial sentence. He said that he was deeply sorry that his own errors of judgement had caused so much pain. Jemesa Lawebuka, Filimone Vadei, Lepani Raitila, Sesoni Sabera It was announced on 6 December 2005 that charges were expected to be laid against a further 98 individuals, with four appearing in court that morning on unlawful assembly charges. The four ‚Äì Jemesa Lawebuka, Filimone Vadei, Lepani Raitila, and Sesoni Sabera ‚Äì had been arrested along with George Speight and his rebel group at Kalabu Fijian School in 2001. All four pleaded guilty, and Magistrate Ajmal Gulab Khan sentenced them to be bound over for twelve months, with a fine of F$300 each. They had not been the leaders of the Kalabu roadblock, Khan considered, but mere sheep following orders. Their decision to plead guilty had also allowed them a discount on what their sentence would have been. Mele Afu On 20 January 2006 Mele Afu, a 43-year- old woman from Narere, Koro Island, appeared in court facing a larceny of documents charge. The charge relates to her having been found in possession of eight classified military documents, and two documents belonging to the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, which Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni considered potentially a valuable clue to the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unity (CRW)-led mutiny at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2000. According to police Inspector Sekaia Suluka, the following documents were found in Afu's possession: # Command diaries belonging to the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit (CRW). # The minutes of the meetings of the National Security Council in 1999 and 2000. # Civil Aviation Security Decree, and contingency plans. # Photographs and negatives belonging to the CRW. # A 1997 contingency plan for Nadi International Airport. # Threat analysis. # Port Police operation procedures. # A black list roll. # A document pertaining to Soviet and Libyan operations in Fiji. # Briefings from the Indian High Commission. She was found to be in possession of the documents when arrested on a separate coup-related charge on 21 January 2005, and taken from Koro Island to Suva for questioning. Suluka said that police had discovered the documents in her possession, some of them in her suitcase, while questioning her in Nabua over the destruction of a studio belonging to Fiji Television Limited during the 2000 coup. She had denied knowing that the documents were stolen, saying that former CRW soldier Selestino Kalounivale, a close relative of Afu's, who was killed by loyalist soldiers in the mutiny in which he allegedly participated, had given them to her at the Parliamentary complex at the height of the coup and instructed her to keep them, according to defence lawyer Angeline Lata. Her fears of the Military had inhibited her from returning the documents to them, Afu said. Suluka rejected this defence, saying that her keeping of the documents for five years was an indication that she knew they were stolen. Leweni said that a Military investigation would be conducted as to how and why Afu came to be in possession of the documents. On 27 January, Magistrate Ajmal Khan acquitted Afu in the Suva High Court. The prosecution had not provided evidence to support its charges that the documents were original, or that Afu had intentionally stolen them, Khan said. He accepted her defence that she had not known the confidential nature of the documents when Kalounivale had given them to her for safekeeping; Kalounivale, for his part, was dead and therefore could not give evidence, he ruled. Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit ‚Äì Court Martial On 16 August 2005, the Fiji Court of Appeal delivered a landmark ruling, ordering a retrial of 20 soldiers from the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit (CRW) who had been convicted in a court martial of participating in the 2000 coup and in a subsequent mutiny in November 2000, and sentenced to prison terms of between three and six years. Various legal technicalities have resulted in several adjournments in the court martial retrial since the naming of the court martial panel, under Judge Advocate Graeme Leung, on 5 October.

Rosehill Junction was the name of the railway station that opened here in 1882, just west of the bridge over the Duck River . It was a junction for the Western railway line with the Carlingford railway line and Sandown railway line. The Commissioner of Railways Edward Miller Grant Eddy renamed the station Clyde Junction,The Department of Railways Research and Information Section (1966) Railway Quiz (Department of Railways) p11 before settling upon the name Clyde in 1883 saying: New Glasgow is close by and as old Glasgow is watered by the Clyde, to which Duck River has been likened, perhaps Clyde would not be unacceptable.

Plot It is narrated by the Biblical King David of Israel, and purports to be his deathbed memoirs; however, this David does not recount his life in a straightforward fashion, and the storyline is often hilariously fractured. Indeed, it is possible to read the book as Heller's meditation upon his own mortality, and an exploration of the Jewish view of family, life, death, etc. All of the major touchstones of King David's life are in place: his childhood herding sheep, the prophet Samuel, Goliath, King Saul, Jonathan (and homosexual innuendoes), Bathsheba and Uriah, the Psalms, the treachery of Absalom, Solomon, etc. At some points, David betrays knowledge of the future (he mentions Michelangelo's David, saying it is ironic that a King of the Jews should stand there uncircumcised), and even of heaven (Moses sits on a rock in the afterworld, working on his stutter) - we are left to guess whether or not this stems from his special relationship with God, as no answers are forthcoming.

The listing included the reservoir and all associated pipework, valves and valve houses to the property boundary. = Collaroy Trig Station = The requirement for accurate maps in Australia led to the development of a control network of Trig stations. The word \\"trig\\" is short for trigonometric. Trig stations can be located on landmarks such as hills or high man-made structures such as buildings, or grain silos or water reservoirs. The process of triangulation was used as the method to provide the locations of the trig stations, which were then used to connect to smaller scale surveys or for mapping. The geodetic infrastructure in New South Wales incorporates approximately 6,000 traditional trigonometric stations that formed the backbone of the survey control network before the introduction of more than 160 CORSnet-NSW stations. TP5865 - Collaroy Trig station is located on top of the heritage Collaroy Reservoir. = Collaroy radar station 54RS - WWII= In February 1942 American forces arrived in Australia bringing with them MAWDs (Modified Air Warning Device); which filled an urgent need in Australia. The operators sat out in the open exposed to the elements and hand turned the aerial, even during tropical downpours, heavy winds, etcetera. 101RS station was installed at North Head, Sydney, NSW close to the Army coastal batteries. Little is known of its performance there except that it interfered with Army communications between batteries. Brig. J S Whitelaw, Commander of Fixed Defences, spoke to P/O Swan requesting that the unit be moved adding the comment that 101RS would provide better air warning if it was relocated north of Sydney as Japanese ships were in the Coral Sea. P/O Swan selected the Collaroy Plateau as the new site after travelling to Palm Beach by bus. 54RS at Collaroy was to become one of the more important radar sites particularly as a testing ground due to its relatively close proximity to the laboratory. It also served as a training station for operators and as a rest station for airmen who had served in the northern combat zones. 54RS was officially disbanded on 21 January 1947. p49 - P 59 Extracts from = Northern Beaches = View from Collaroy Plateau north across Narrabeen beach and lagoon Various parts of Collaroy Plateau overlook Collaroy Beach, Long Reef Beach, Narrabeen Beach and Narrabeen Lagoon.

He then became the leader of CSIRO's Radiophysics Radio Astronomy Division from 1945 till his death in 1962. The work of Joseph Pawsey has led to the development and commercialisation of modern technologies including wi-fi. = Frank Hurley = James Francis (Frank) Hurley (1885‚Äì1962), adventurer, photographer and film maker, was born on 15 October 1885 at Glebe, Sydney. He died at his home at Collaroy Plateau on 16 January 1962. Follow the link for some of his photography taken on Collaroy Plateau and other locations. Sunrise across lagoon from home window at Collaroy Plateau. Australian Screen = Ted Dellit, a WW2 radar veteran = Ted lived on Collaroy Plateau from 1961 for many years. His book, Who Were They?, The Royal Australian Air Force on Collaroy Plateau in the Second World War, is reputed to be one of the best written and researched unit histories available. He donated many books to the library at EASTROC RAAF Williamtown, and the library was renamed, \\"The Ted Dellit Library\\". As WW2 radar people wrote their unit histories Ted ensured that a copy of each book went to the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum at Neatishead, near Norwich in England. Ted was for many years an active member of the Radar Branch of the RAAF Association (NSW), was a member of the committee since 1993 and held the positions of Secretary and DVA rep. He resigned from the committee in 2007. He was also an active member of the Collaroy Plateau Public School Parents & Citizens Association and managed a number of soccer and cricket teams of the Collaroy Plateau Youth Club.
