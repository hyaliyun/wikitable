Jessica Williams, 118 Nev. 536, was a high-profile criminal trial in the State of Nevada in which exotic dancer Jessica Williams was sentenced to 18 to 48 years in prison after falling asleep behind the wheel of her minivan, drifting onto an Interstate 15 (I-15) median north of Las Vegas, and killing six teenage county workers. The case received national media exposure and has been called \\"one of the most prominent Nevada cases involving a marijuana DUI.\\" Incident In March 2000, six teenagers, serving as a county work crew picking up freeway trash, were killed when a minivan driven by 20-year-old exotic dancer Jessica Williams drifted onto the median and plowed through them. The victims, ages 14 to 16, had been convicted of minor offenses in juvenile court, and in lieu of jail time were assigned to county cleanup crews. Trial Williams claimed that she had simply fallen asleep at the wheel, while prosecutors contended that Williams was under the influence of marijuana and ecstasy. Prosecutors argued that Williams should be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, reckless driving and driving under the influence resulting in death. The sentence for a conviction ranged from probation with no incarceration to a prison term of 120 years with the possibility of parole. At trial, Williams admitted that she smoked marijuana the night before the incident. However, Williams' defense attorney John Watkins argued that Williams was not under the influence of drugs at the time of the crash. While a jury found that Williams was not impaired and had simply fallen asleep, the \\"per se\\" law that allowed no detectable amount of marijuana in the body whatsoever forced a DUI conviction. Williams was found guilty of driving under the influence of marijuana and sentenced to 36 months to 90 months in prison for each of the six victims to run consecutively. In October 2019, after serving 19 years in prison, Williams was granted parole and was released from prison. On June 18, 2020, a federal judge vacated the convictions of Williams. While vacating, U.S. District Judge Kent J. Dawson stated: \\"‚Ä¶ this Court cannot be reasonably certain that the jury did convict based on the valid marijuana alternative for culpability rather than the constitutionally invalid marijuana metabolite alternative, regarding Williams‚Äô convictions based upon driving with a prohibited substance in her blood. Indeed, on the record presented, it was in truth more probable that the jury convicted Williams based on the invalid marijuana metabolite alternative.\\" References Category:Trials in the United States Category:Crimes in Nevada ","title":"State of Nevada v.

It includes 18 species that grow on bark and rocks, and are mostly distributed in the Southern Hemisphere. The genus was created in 2014 as a segregate of Parmelia. Taxonomy Notoparmelia was circumscribed by lichenologists Ana Crespo, Zuzana Ferencov√°, and Pradeep Kumar Divakar in 2014. The genus includes a group of mostly Australasian species previously placed in Parmelia. Although the group of species had previously been shown to form a monophyletic lineage in Parmelia, they had not at that time been examined sufficiently to identify any morphological features that could be used to distinguish them from Parmelia. Subsequent study of the anatomy and fine morphology of the ascomata and ascospores revealed differences that could be used as diagnostic characters to define a new genus for this lineage of species. Notoparmelia differs morphologically from Parmelia species by having thinner ascospore walls and a proper exciple (a layer of hyphae directly surrounding and derived from the ascocarp itself, not including any thalline material) that is reduced to one layer without zonation and comprising exclusively loosely branched large hyphae embedded in an abundant polysaccharide matrix. The proper exciple is surrounded by a continuous layer of algae. The genus name combines the Greek n«íto- (\\"southern\\", \\"south\\" ‚Äì referring to its Southern Hemisphere distribution) with Parmelia. The name Aspidelia is an earlier legitimate generic name for the genus that was overlooked when Notoparmelia was published. The authors later formally proposed Aspidelia for rejection so that Notoparmelia could be retained. In 2017, however, the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi rejected the proposal, preferring that priority should take precedence. Despite this, , no proposal has been made to transfer Notoparmelia species to Aspidelia, and Notoparmelia is used in recent reviews of fungal classification. Description Notoparmelia species have a foliose thallus that is adnate (attached to the substratum) to loosely adnate (loosely attached to nearly free growing). It is irregularly lobate (having lobes), with lobes measuring 2.0‚Äì7.0 mm wide with rounded tips. Pseudocyphellae are usually effigurate (having a definite form or figure). Rhizines are squarrosely branched (branching at right angles). The apothecia are stipitate or nearly so, and split radially with age. The proper exciple is cup-shaped, with a single thick (30‚Äì70 ¬µm) hyaline layer. Unlike other parmelioids, it is not differentiated into three layers. Ascospores are ellipsoid, typically measuring 11.5‚Äì16.5 by 7.5‚Äì10¬µm with a spore wall that is less than 1 ¬µm thick. In contrast, other parmelioids have spore walls greater than 1 ¬µm thick.

His feast day is on December 13. Ursicinus was the chancellor of queen Ultragotha, wife of Childebert I, king of Paris. He was chosen by Maurilio, then-bishop of Cahors, to be his successor. In 585, the Second Synod of M√¢con, assembled at the request of king Guntram of Orl√©ans, began to conduct trials of those who had declared themselves in favor of the rebel Gundowald, who claimed to be the son of Clothar I. Ursicinus publicly confessed to having received Gundowald and having declared himself in his favor. The synod sentenced him to three years' penance. During this penance he had to let his beard and hair grow (priests of the time wearing tonsure and no beard), not to consume meat and wine, not to celebrate mass, not to ordain priests, nor to consecrate churches or bless bread. During this penance, St. Gregory of Tours recounts an event as one indicative of the greed of bishops of the era. Innocent, count of G√©vaudan and elected bishop of Rodez under pressure from Brunhilda of Austrasia, attempting to claim more land, accused Ursicinus of unjustly holding parishes that should be under the bishopric of Rodez. To judge this dispute, Sulpitius, the archbishop of Bourges, convened a council in Clermont in 587. It was decided there that the bishop of Cahors would keep the parishes for which the bishop of Rodez could not prove that a bishop of Rodez had exercised his authority there.

Taylor moved to Paris in 2009 and he began stand-up in 2013. He is known in France for his television series on Canal+, What the Fuck France, What's Up France? and Stereotrip. He performed his first stand-up show #Franglais from 2016 to 2018 and his second show, So British (ou presque), debuted on 18 October 2019 in Paris.  Biography  Between the ages of 2 and 4, Taylor lived in Geneva with his English father and Irish mother. He then lived in France until he was 9, which explains his ability to speak French without an English accent. He returned to England when his parents separated. Taylor studied languages at university and is fluent in French and Spanish. He then worked for Apple in sales. After three years, he started working as an international trainer for the brand. He moved to Paris at 23. As he said in his show #Franglais, when he quit working at Apple he did not apply for any unemployment benefits, which is quite unusual in France. = Media debut = While at university, Taylor was an extra in The Oxford Murders. What made him known to a larger audience, though, was the online video La Bise (referring to the cheek kisses used as a greeting in France). The video, which was promoting a night of English language humor in Paris, was uploaded on 1 January 2016, and now has more than 3 million views. Filmed in a sequence shot, La Bise mocked this French tradition, and served as a model for Taylor's show What the Fuck France? episodes. = Television = Thanks to the success of La Bise seen over a million times in a few days on YouTube, Canal+ contacted him the following week, offering him to develop a regular short program, along the same format. What the Fuck France? was then broadcast on Canal+. The three-minute short comedy show debuted in September 2016, and ran for 34 episodes where Taylor humorously dissects the peculiarities of French life, seen through an expat's eyes. What the Fuck France? was one of the first shows broadcast in English on a French network. A second program, also broadcast on Canal+, was released in 2017 in a similar format: What's Up France? This time, Taylor dissected and analysed the French news in 14 episodes. Finally, a third show was created in 2018 with Canal+. Stereotrip (a contraction of stereotype and roadtrip) reviews the clich√©s and stereotypes associated with Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Germany, and England in six 45-minute episodes.  Stand-up shows  Taylor defines himself primarily as a stand-up comedian. After a few attempts in England at amateur stand-up, he made his debut in Paris in 2013. He became successful quite quickly, particularly thanks to his online videos and his projects with Canal+. His first stand-up show, #Franglais, 50% in French, 50% en anglais, was performed in different Parisian theatres such as Le Sentier des Halles, La Nouvelle Eve, and L'Europ√©en, and then on tour in France, Europe and Canada, for almost three years. The entire show was filmed at La Nouvelle Eve in March 2018, and broadcast on Canal+. The final three shows were held at the Casino de Paris in front of 1,400 spectators. On 18 October 2019 Taylor debuted his second show: So British (ou presque) after a break-in period of a few weeks in August 2018 at the Point Virgule. The new show was almost called Rebecoming English, but the title was rejected as the verb to rebecome was a neologism coined by Taylor. On 22 June 2020 he participated in a special show, Retour vers la Culture, organised at L'Europ√©en, to celebrate the end of the Coronavirus lockdown and a return to normality in France. A dozen artists performed that night, such as Bun Hay Mean and Fills Monkey.  Live at Five and Happy Hour  On 20 April 2020 Taylor debuted a new show on YouTube to entertain his fans during the Coronavirus lockdown: Live at Five. It originally streamed from Taylor's kitchen table at 5 PM CEST, but was eventually moved to 7 PM CEST, and then 6 PM CEST to accommodate Taylor's home life. During the show, Taylor would chat directly with fans, using FaceTime and Skype to videocall his family (primarily his mother, though both his brother and father did appear on the show), co-workers such as his director Felix, and particularly long-time friend and fellow comedian, Quebecois Rolly Assal. The episodes lasted approximately an hour. At some point, Taylor decided to rename his live broadcasts Paul Taylor's Happy Hour, as he'd often drink a beer while filming and chatting. The show was primarily in English, though there were several special episodes, dubbed \\"Frandredi\\" (from fran√ßais and vendredi, \\"French Friday\\") on Fridays, when the show was almost entirely in French. Some later episodes also included Taylor interacting with fans via Zoom. Taylor streamed 70 episodes, until 7 July 2020, before taking a break for the French summer holidays. Most episodes after 10 May have been turned into podcasts, and are available for free on Taylor's website, with additional material at the beginning and end of each podcast.  Inspiration  Comedians Lee Evans, Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K are credited as influences of Taylor.  Personal life  Taylor married his wife Adeline on 3 June 2017.

The group can usually trace back full or partial heritage to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, as well as nations which border with, or are otherwise ethnoculturally connected to, Eastern Europe. In diasporic terms, people with ancestry derived from Central European nations are at times included in the pan-ethnic grouping by British media. This is similar to Eastern European Americans and Eastern European Canadians in North America, and Eastern European Australians in Oceania. There are roughly 2.2 million Eastern European nationals living in the UK, with the largest groups being: Polish, Romanian and Lithuanian nationals. There are 1,429,000 nationals from EU8 countries, 570,000 nationals from EU2 countries, 29,000 from other EU* nations (outside of the EU14**) and 216,000 from non-EU Europe. *Other EU nations refer to Cyprus, Malta and Croatia **EU14 refers to the members of the EU before 2004 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden). Terminology As Eastern European is not a category used in official statistics in the United Kingdom, the category holds similar status to East Asians and Southeast Asians in the United Kingdom, in that it is nonetheless used extensively in British media, research and scholarly works in terms of identification and classicification of a distinct pan-ethnic group. Demographics According to the 2011 UK census, Boston, Lincolnshire was the town with highest percentage of Eastern-European residents in England and Wales. =Education= A 2014 King's College London report found that pupils from the pan-ethnic group faced stereotypes associated with their heritage. There were also revealed to be intragroup grade differences between different nationalities. A 2019 UCL Institute of Education report found a significant achievement gap between Eastern European students and those of a white British background. =Employment= A 2013 academic report found data suggesting \\"Eastern Europeans in Scotland value the opportunities for self-employment.\\" In 2015, the majority of the grouping, that were resident in Suffolk, were working-age and often young adults. In 2017, published data showed that many held low-skilled or untrained occupations. History The 1901 United Kingdom census recorded 86,240 Eastern Europeans in England and Wales, and a further 10,373 in Scotland. This represented a increase of over 55,000 on the previous 1891 census. =Post-war refugees and labour= In the aftermath of World War II, approximately 80,000 Eastern Europeans, who were displaced or homeless, settled in the United Kingdom. CEE (Central and Eastern European) refugees were also recruited as labourers from the European Voluntary Workers scheme, and were brought into the country by Clement Attlee's government to rebuild post-war Britain. =EU accession= Since the opening up of EU accession in the early 21st-century, many Eastern Europeans have migrated to parts the United Kingdom. This two- decade migration phenomenon has been described as unprecedented in the history of the country. In 2007 Rural Sociology published research which used Eastern Europeans in Britain as one of several examples of exceptional developments in the large-scale use of foreign labour or foreign workers in high-income nation's agricultural markets. This has created some social challenges in Britain. Russell Deacon has highlighted tension in Welsh-speaking areas of Wales, and how Cymuned, a Welsh pressure group, lobbied the Welsh government to prioritize housing for locals over East Europeans in the early 2000s. In 2014, an analysis by John Harris appeared to outline social problems that had been created by large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe (and surrounding areas). Issues included reports of mafias operating, intra-ethnic disputes, killings, but also reported developments, including the ongoing revival of town centres due to East Europeans economic activity. =Brexit= In June 2016, a referendum on the country's membership of the European Union took place. With a result to leave, many Eastern Europeans' relationship with, or perceived status in, the United Kingdom changed permanently. The month after the EU referendum, Under-Secretary of State Karen Bradley spoke in the House of Commons to address the issue of Eastern Europeans receiving xenophobic abuse in the aftermath of the result. In 2018, British media reported growing concern for East European people affected by Brexit. A 2018 study suggested the political process had particularly affected young Eastern Europeans \\"positioned in between the category of ‚Äúmigrant‚Äù and ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù. Increasing living standards back home have been suggested in media as an explanatory driving force for the return of Eastern Europeans to their birth nations in 2019. Cultural influenceEconomic= Due to the frequent and significant waves of migration of Eastern Europeans to the country in the 21st-century, evidence has showed that the United Kingdom's employment culture has been changed by the myriad of recruitment agencies and training networks organised to support and employ the group. =In fiction= From a Ukrainian family, British author Marina Lewycka's 2005 and 2007 novels A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and Two Caravans focus on Eastern Europeans agricultural workers in England. Social and political issuesDiscrimination= Representative of the polarising nature regarding the issue of immigration from the region, in 2010, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's election campaign was reported to be negatively affected when he called a member of his party a \\"bigoted woman\\", after the Labour supporter raised the topic of Eastern Europeans arriving in Britain. In 2013, Romanian diplomat Ion Jinga suggested that \\"inflammatory rhetoric\\" in politics was increasing the risk of physical attacks on Eastern Europeans resident in the country. =Integration= A 2013 Environment and Planning report correlated a \\"positive and strongly significant relationship between self-employment and integration\\" for the group. In 2014, University College London's Dr Julia Halej published study which analyzed perceptions created by national media; how Eastern Europeans within the country occupied the social boundary of \\"whiteness\\" in Britain, being variously portrayed as \\"‚Äòvaluable‚Äô, ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô and ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô\\". A 2014 King's College London report, which examined the insights and challenges into the rapidly increasing various Eastern European ethnic groups in the UK education system, found that \\"Young people from Eastern Europe are seen as a new ‚ÄòOther‚Äô, both by the white majority and more established minority ethnic groups.\\" A 2018 research by Dr Magdalena Nowicka, published in the Journal of Intercultural Studies, detailed data-studies which revealed how some people within the group aspired for, or achieved, increased social status by emphasising their whiteness and \\"embracing the meritocratic values of the white British class\\".

She also worked with Green on his feature first film, Gun Hill Road. In 2017, Green contacted Howard to develop a feature film script for Premature. The film follows Howard as Ayanna, a 17-year-old New Yorker who strikes up a summer romance with an artist in his twenties (Joshua Boone). It premiered at Sundance 2019. The film received positive critical reception. Writing for Elle, Candace Frederick called it \\"the kind of confident, remarkably vulnerable drama to which even veteran storytellers aspire.\\" Michael Cuby of Nylon described it as, \\"a coming-of-age love story that's as much about finding your first love as it is about using that first love to find yourself.\\" Howard's first play, STEW, ran in February 2020 at Walkerspace in New York. It centers on a family of three generations of women who must grapple with their personal choices.

In this role, she led the World Nursing Now Campaign at the national level in 2019. =Minister of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru= On 2 April 2018, Liliana La Rosa was sworn in as Minister of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru, joining the Villanueva cabinet of Mart√≠n Vizcarra's government. Her appointment caused controversy in some sectors, recalling that she had been a member of the Broad Front, a conglomerate of leftist groups that had contributed to the fall of the previous government of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. La Rosa defended herself by saying that she had resigned from the Broad Front months before, when she was elected National Dean of the College of Nurses.

She is a professor at The Scripps Research Institute, located in La Jolla, California. Her work has contributed to the establishment of physiological importance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases beyond their classical role in supporting mRNA translation and their disordered processes that contribute to disease. She founded the Translation Machinery in Health and Disease Gordon Research Conference, an ongoing biannual international conference since 2015. She helped co-found aTyr Pharma, a Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company.  Early Life and Education  Xiang-Lei Yang was born in Changsha in Southern China, as the younger child of Benlian Yang (Êù®Êú¨ÊøÇ) and Xiulan Gu (Ë∞∑ÁßÄÂÖ∞). Before she was born, Yang‚Äôs father was a lecturer at PLA Military Institute of Engineering in Harbin in Northeast China, where her sister Danzhou Yang (Êù®‰∏πÊ¥≤) was born. The souring of relations between communist China with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, known as the Sino-Soviet split, led to countrywide strategic relocations and caused Yang's parents and sister to migrate over 2600 kilometers to Changsha where Xiang-Lei Yang was born. Her father became a professor at National University of Defense Technology in Changsha teaching Applied Mathematics. With a great admiration for science and technology, her parents encouraged both sisters to become scientists from a young age. Unlike her sister, who had always been a stellar student, Xiang-Lei was rebellious and lacked motivation. After attending college at Capital University of Medical Sciences in Beijing, she moved back to her hometown but decided soon that there was no future for her in Changsha. With the help of her sister, she became a graduate student in the lab of Andrew H.-J. Wang at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she learned both NMR and X-ray crystallography techniques to determine atomic structures of DNA molecules and to study their interaction with drug-like small molecules. In 1999 Yang was received the Harvey Van Cleave Research Award for a graduate student at the University of Illinois.Yang earned her Ph.D. degree in 2000. * B.S., Biomedical Engineering, Capital University of Medical Sciences in Beijing, 1993 * Ph.D., Biophysics and Computational Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000  Scientific Contributions  Based on strong encouragement from her Ph.D. advisor, Yang joined the lab of Paul Schimmel at The Scripps Research Institute as a postdoctoral scientist. The Schimmel lab had just discovered that a member of the human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase; TyrRS), used for supporting protein synthesis in the cytosol, can also be secreted out of the cell, where it can be activated by proteolysis to release cytokine-like functions for cell signaling purpose. The first project Yang undertook in the Schimmel lab was to solve the crystal structure of the human TyrRS to understand the structural basis forthis cytokine activation. She successfully determined the structure and, after screening hundreds of crystals, pushed the resolution to 1.18 √Ö, the highest resolution for any atomic structure of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases thus far. Her research elucidated the mechanism of cytokine activation that led to a constitutively activated form of full-length TyrRS. Yang became an assistant professor at The Scripps Research Institute Department of Molecular Medicine in 2005. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and to tenured full professor in 2014. At Scripps, she has continued making scientific advances in this field while running her own research laboratory. Yang and her lab have solved the first crystal structure of many human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). These not only provided the structural basis for various functions of tRNA synthetases, but also revealed intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in human human tRNA synthetases in contrast to their counterparts in lower organisms. Yang proposed that these IDRs play an important role in expanding the tRNA synthetase ‚Äòfunctionome‚Äô during evolution. While working on structure analysis of tRNA synthetases, Yang encountered a significant knowledge gap in the field, which was the physiological role of the ‚Äònew‚Äô functions of tRNA synthetases. Yang looked for the connection to human diseases. Her initial focus was on a neurodegenerative disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), because the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the largest gene family causatively linked to CMT . The Yang lab and their collaborators extensively studied the canonical enzymatic function of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in relation to CMT and excluded a loss- of-function disease mechanism. Instead, their work has established that dysregulations of regulatory functions of tRNA synthetases contribute critically to the etiology of CMT disease, uncovering yet another new role for human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases beyond their classical enzymatic activity. Work on seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) demonstrated for the first time that an appended domain dispensable for enzymatic activity of SerRS can be essential for the development of vertebrates. Demonstration of these broader physiological roles embedded in the genes of human aminoacyl tRNA synthetases has caused a paradigm shift in the field of human genetics and has led to new avenues for therapeutic approaches to treat a wide variety of human diseases such as inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and neurological disorders. In 2005, Schimmel and Yang founded aTyr Pharma, a biotechnology company pursuing tRNA synthetase derived molecules, for therapeutic applications. The Yang lab has unveiled broad regulatory roles of tRNA synthetases in vascular biology, the circulatory system, stress response, and proteostasis and provided in-depth mechanistic understanding of these non- canonical functions at the levels of whole organisms, cells, and molecules. Yang has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers and is an inventor on 3 issued US patents and 9 pending US patent applications  Selected Publications  * Yang XL, Wang AH.

He previously served as an assistant general secretary of the Labour Party from 1999 to 2001, regional director of the North West Labour Party from 1995 to 1999 and founded The Campaign Company, a political consultancy.  Early life and career  Evans was born in February 1961 in Chester, moving to London when he was three. He was an activist during the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85, during which time he was arrested \\"for something like highway obstruction as he delivered a food parcel to the striking miners\\". He served as a Labour councillor in Croydon from 1986 to 1990. He was regional secretary of the Labour Party for North West England from 1995 to 1999. During this time he organised Labour's campaign in the 1997 Wirral South by-election, when the party gained the seat for the first time. Evans went on to serve as assistant general secretary of the Labour Party from 1999 to 2001. In 1999 he wrote a proposal to \\"overhaul\\" the party's structures, suggesting that \\"representative democracy should as far as possible be abolished in the Party\\" in favour of elections by one member, one vote. Evans argued this would \\"empower modernising forces within the party and marginalise Old Labour\\". He \\"played a key backroom role in [Labour's] 2001 election victory\\". In 2001, Evans and Jonathan Upton, formerly Labour's head of corporate development, started a political consultancy in Croydon called The Campaign Company. The company supported Labour politicians Tony Banks and Robert Evans to seek selection. Evans' wife, Aline Delawa, was company secretary in 2002, at the same time as running the party's \\"constitutional and legal affairs unit\\". In 2002 the company was hired to support the cross-party European Movement which was lobbying for Britain to change currency to the Euro. The Daily Telegraph described the company as a \\"lobbying firm which advises the NHS, Government departments and political activists seeking selection as party candidates\\". Evans served on the board of Chester F.C. and now serves on Chester F.C. Community Trust's board.  General Secretary  After the Labour Party lost the 2019 general election, Jeremy Corbyn resigned as leader of the Labour Party. After his successor, Keir Starmer, was elected, Jennie Formby, considered an ally of Corbyn, resigned as general secretary of the party. A number of candidates were shortlisted to replace Formby, including Evans, Andrew Fisher, Neena Gill and Byron Taylor, who was considered to be the other candidate most likely to be appointed to the position. He was appointed on 26 May 2020, after twenty of the thirty-eight National Executive Committee members voted for him. His appointment was seen as a victory for Starmer, as Evans was described by The Independent as Starmer's \\"first choice\\" candidate. The Jewish Chronicle described Evans as a \\"staunch opponent of hard left politics\\" and a \\"fierce critic of anti-Zionism\\".  Personal life  Evans played bass and sang in the post-punk collective Greenfield Leisure, and supports Chester FC.

He was Minister of Justice, Worship and Instruction (1931); Minister of Foreign Relations (1931); first vice president of the Republic (1945‚Äì1948); President of the Senate (1956‚Äì1957), and also Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Peru (1955‚Äì1956), among other academic and political positions, which he carried out with notable success. As a writer, he achieved reputation for his entertaining and informed chronicles on landscapes and customs of the Peruvian capital, which earned him the name of \\"Chronicler of Lima\\"; and for his elegant, refined and harmonious poetry, circumscribed in modernism, which resulted in his being proclaimed as the \\"Poet of Youth\\" in 1908. For his literary work, he earned many awards.  Early life  Barrenechea was born in Tarma, a mountain city in central Peru. He was the son of the engineer Justiniano A. G√°lvez Moreno and Amalia Barrenechea and Guti√©rrez de la Fuente. On the paternal side, he was the grandson of Jos√© G√°lvez Eg√∫squiza, who was a hero of the battle of 2 May 1866, and nephew of Jos√© G√°lvez Moreno, a hero of the Pacific War of 1879‚Äì1883. On the maternal side, he was the grandson of the jurist and diplomat Jos√© Antonio Barrenechea y Morales and great-grandson of Marshal Antonio Guti√©rrez de la Fuente, who was supreme head of the Republic in 1829. After his father died in 1894, his family moved to Lima. He completed his elementary studies from La Inmaculada and high school studies at Nuestra Se√±ora of Guadalupe. In the 5th year of the latter in 1901, he served as editor of La voz guadalupana along with other distinguished associates, such as Constantino Carvallo, Baltasar Caravedo, Hermilio Valdiz√°n and Pedro Yrigoyen Diez Canseco.  Education  After completing his studies of high school in 1901, he entered the National University of San Marcos. There he became friends with Jos√© de la Riva Ag√ºero y Osma, V√≠ctor Andr√©s Bela√∫nde, Ventura Garc√≠a Calder√≥n, and many others. With these persons, he joined the so-called Generation of 900, or \\"Arielista\\". Simultaneously, he worked in the Lima Public Charity Society, and later as a journalist in Illustracion Peruana, Varidades, La Cronica and El Comercio.  Career  In 1910, he chaired the Peruvian delegation that attended the Second Congress of American Students in Buenos Aires. In 1911, he won an international competition to select the lyrics for the \\"Hymn to American Students\\", Chilean composer Enrique Soro wrote the music for the song (1912). In 1913, he married Amparo Ayarza Noriega, with whom he had three children. One of them died at a premature age. He graduated with a Bachelor degree in Arts in Literature and Jurisprudence, a Doctor of Philosophy and Literature in 1915 (His thesis was on the \\"Possibility of a genuine national literature\\", which in opinion of critics, was a kind of reply to the book \\"Character of the Literature of Independent Peru\\", written by Riva Ag√ºero), and a doctor in Law, in 1922. In 1915 he began teaching at the university in San Marcos,retaining different posts, such as the professor of Spanish Literature (1920), American and Peruvian Literature (1922‚Äì1924) and Ancient Literature (1925‚Äì1932), as well as the dean of the Faculty of Arts (1928‚Äì1932). Between 1918 and 1920, he served as the Peruvian consul in Barcelona, Spain, a position he resigned due to strifes with President Augusto Legu√≠a. An active participant in Peruvian politics, Galvez joined the Democratic Nationalist Party (derived from the former Democratic Party or pierolista), and served as the mayor of Tarma (1921), where he accomplished many feats. He was a prominent cultivator of \\"La Muliza\\", organizing a lavish carnival with Oscar and Carlos y N√©stor Arrieta y Barinaga, who were brothers. They were landowners and friends of the G√°lvezs from a century ago. He was later legal advisor to the delegation sent to the Tacna and Arica plebiscite commission (1926). After the first presidency of Commander Luis S√°nchez Cerro, he was part of the cabinet led by David Samanez Ocampo. Between 11 March and 23 July 1931, he was Minister of Justice and Instruction. On 25 July 1931, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs, and remained in the post till 8 December. When Commander Luis S√°nchez Cerro assumed the presidency of Peru for a second term, Galvez withdrew from politics and returned to journalism. After the assassination of S√°nchez Cerro and the rise to power of General √ìscar R. Benavides, he became Minister plenipotentiary to Colombia in 1935. Following the annulment of the victory of Luis Antonio Eguiguren in the 1936 elections, he resigned his diplomatic post and returned to Peru, departing again from politics. The University of San Marcos entrusted him with the study of popular literature, where he was preoccupied in the study of marineras, a traditional form of dance in Peru. In 1938 he contributed to the foundation of the National Association of Writers and Artists (ANEA), of which he was the first president.  Return to politics  He returned to politics as one of the promoters of the National Democratic Front, which launched the candidacy of Jos√© Luis Bustamante y Rivero with a view to the 1945 general elections, which won the elections. He was elected First Vice President and Senator of the Republic by Lima, and became president of the chamber (1945‚Äì1948). After the coup d'√©tat of General Manuel A. Odr√≠a, he once again retired from politics. In 1956, during Peru's democratic transition he headed the list to Congress by the Independent Democratic Front in the elections and was elected Senator of the Republic by Lima, winning by a wide margin. For the second time, he assumed the presidency of the Chamber (therefore, of the Congress in ). he died in Lima on 8 February 1957, at the age of 71 in office. His burial, which was given the honor a president's burial is supposed to receive, attracted massive gatherings. In addition, he was president of the Club Jose Galvez, a member of the Bar Association of the Geographical Society of the National Club of the Club of the Union, of the Historical Institute of Peru, the Peruvian Academy of Language, the Academy of Arts and Letters of Havana, the Royal Spanish Academy and the Academy of History of Madrid.

The rivalry is characterised by a tight head-to-head tally in terms of the Maltese Premier League, with Valletta having won 25 competitions, and Floriana having won 26. Sporting and cultural rivalry The Floriana‚ÄìValletta derby is one of the largest derby matches in Malta. Although the rivalry is mostly a sporting one, there have been cases where this has seeped through to other aspects. In 1922, a Floriana gang had pulled a tram off its tracks, overturned it and attacked the Valletta fans inside with stones, which led to The Malta Police Force re-routing traffic of Valletta fans away from the main streets of Floriana upon returning from the stadium ever since. Floriana are known to request police presence when the derby is played at any level. In fact, Valletta acquired the nickname Tal-Palestina during the 1970s, referring to the troublemaking as if straight out of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The Floriana club traces its roots earlier than those of Valletta, and therefore this has been the envy of many Valletta supporters, who were more successful pre-World War II. Eventually, Valletta gained more sporting success post-war. Due to the close association that Valletta had with the British Navy and the presence of a red-light district in Strada Stretta in the first half of the 20th century, various rivals suggest a potential link to prostitution and unknown paternity, leading to Floriana supporters chanting Min hu missierkom, il-Beltin? () During the 2009‚Äì10 Maltese Premier League, a television crew from Manchester United following Jordi Cruyff, who was plying his trade with Valletta for his final professional season, commented that the derby was one of the most powerful games they had ever featured. In 2011, Nigel Holland, then Mayor of Floriana, argued that there may be rivalry in local government, when it came to which of the two localities should host the national New Year's Eve celebrations.  2010‚Äì11 season  In 2011, Valletta and Floriana were finalists of the 2010‚Äì11 Maltese FA Trophy. Valletta were league champions that season, and Floriana came in at close second. This provided an electrifying setting for the last match of the season. Floriana won the match with a goal late in the game from Ivan Woods. Upon the final whistle, Floriana attacking midfielder Christian Cassar reportedly provoked supporters and club officials by celebrating at the Valletta side. Valletta striker Terence Scerri pushed the Floriana player, an action which received a red card. Valletta president Victor Sciriha condemned violence but also hoped that anyone who provoked is also charged. Prior to the match, then Floriana president Johann Said allegedly accused Valletta president Victor Sciriha of allegedly attempting to bribe Floriana F.C. individuals. Sciriha demanded an apology through a legal letter sent to Said, refuting the claims.  2012‚Äì13 season  Riccardo Gaucci brought then unknown Brazilian striker Igor Coronado to the club, whom he had personally noticed at Aylesbury United F.C..  2013‚Äì14 season  In the second half of the season, Riccardo Gaucci confirmed his presidency of Floriana Football Club, leading a consortium to beat another consortium represented by Dubai-based Medi Tozar on behalf of Englishman Mike Farnan. Gaucci and Farnan were head-to-had in the first vote that the members took in an Extraordinary General Meeting, tying at 93 each, however in a second vote, Gaucci received 162 votes out of the 180 present. Gaucci promised an investment in the pitches owned by the club, namely the Independence Arena, which was valued between ‚Ç¨14 and ‚Ç¨18 million. Gaucci assured that he didn't move to Floriana to misappropriate funds, but instead he wanted to continue his footballing experience. Being mid-way through the season, Footballing departments could not be strengthened immediately, however, Gaucci bolstered the club's Medical Department. He outlined that the transfer policy would not be to attract highly paid stars but realistic targets who could contribute wholeheartedly to the club.  2015‚Äì16 season  Valletta emerged victorious as they had managed to maintain consistency throughout the whole campaign. Victor Sciriha was less vocal, and yet he acted even more wisely in investing resources. His boldest move was to return Paul Zammit at the helm of the senior squad. On the pitch, Federico Falcone's goals were crucial to this consistency.  2016‚Äì17 season  Floriana won the first round derby by winning 2‚Äì0 with goals from Amadou Samb and Mario Fontanella. The second round derby ended in a stalemate with Valletta and Floriana drawing 0‚Äì0.  2018‚Äì19 season  Both Valletta and Floriana started the season with a defeat. Floriana won the third round derby with two goals, from Brandon Paiber and Kristian Keqi. In light of this win, president Gaucci commented how on important the derby is to help bring the fans closer to the club, and declared that he had big plans for the seasons to come. The Greens had a disappointing season, finishing 8th in the 2018‚Äì19 Maltese Premier League. The third-round encounter may have slowed Valletta's progess however they still managed to seal their 25th title, matching Floriana.  2019‚Äì20 season  Banner hoisted by Valletta fan group, Ultras Beltin 999, in support of their mother club's political will to continue playing the final 6 matches. In the 2019‚Äì20 Maltese Premier League, Floriana immediately emerged as the main challengers of Valletta, winning two direct encounters right at the start of the season (against Birkirkara F.C. and Balzan F.C.). Indeed, Valletta spoiled Floriana's plans by matching Kristian Keqi's goal with an equaliser in added time scored by Enmy Pe√±a. Before Covid-19, the last derby was played on February 2, 2020, with Steve Borg heading a freekick by Triston Caruana into the Floriana net. The rivalry intensified in 2020, when the Premier League was suspended abruptly due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malta. On May 18, 2020, the MFA Executive Committee decided to prematurely terminate the league competition and the ongoing FA Trophy competition. Floriana topped the standings with 41 points at the time the league was halted. Valletta, were on the forefront of a small movement that claimed that the league should resume on the pitch, by proposing dates to the Malta Football Association. Eventually, Valletta, together with Birkirkara F.C. and G≈ºira United F.C., wrote to the Prime Minister of Malta Robert Abela. Floriana president Riccardo Gaucci, claimed that the Greens deserved to be assigned the championship given that their performances on the pitch merit this. Then Floriana coach Vincenzo Potenza suggested that since their position was first before the league was stopped, then this proved that Floriana should be rewarded the championship. On 25 May, Floriana were awarded the championship after a vote taken by the MFA council, their 26th title and surpassing Valletta in the all-time champions list. Valletta F.C. president Victor Sciriha argued that the questions were tailor- made in order that they would be voted in favour, due to the agenda of top officials of the Malta Football Association, mainly Bjorn Vassallo and Matthew Paris (the latter being a former Secretary General of Floriana F.C.), claiming that this gerrymandering was on their part to ensure victory for Floriana.

The motion picture, according to reviews and plot descriptions in those publications, opened with scenes of daily activity among a small village of natives led by old Chief Opetek. The tribe later conducts its annual ceremony of bidding farewell or adieu to the sun as the vast territory enters the dark season of winter. Zak, a young man from another distant tribe, is visiting Opetek to participate in the event and to see the chief's beautiful daughter Ananak, whom he intends to marry. After the sun ceremony, Zak departs on his dog sled to return to his own people. On his journey home over the ice, he soon finds a \\"half-frozen\\" white man, a trapper. Zak takes the unconscious stranger back to Opetek's family, and the man awakens under the care of Ananak and her mother Tikatak. Zak now prepares to depart for his home once again, and in keeping with their social customs, he and Ananak say good-bye by smelling the sleeves of one another's sealskin jackets and then rubbing noses. The recovering white trapper observes the couple's interaction, and after Zak leaves he talks to Ananak and ridicules the Eskimo way of showing affection, telling her that men and women in his culture display their affections in much different ways. Ananak over the dark months of winter finds herself increasingly attracted to the hunter. With the change in seasons and the approach of warmer, brighter days, and while her parents are away, Ananak elopes with the white man, who soon deserts her. Zak, now traveling by kayak, manages to track her down and save her from drowning herself to end her shame. He then takes Ananak back home, where they marry after the tribe's medicine man uses sacred oils to cleanse her of the trapper's \\"evil spirits\\".

Her mother, Esther, was among a group of Inuit men, women, and children from the Davis Inlet area of Labrador who were brought to Chicago to build and inhabit an Eskimo Village or \\"human ethnic exhibit\\" during the exposition's six-month run. Much later, in 1910, after traveling for years and demonstrating various aspects of Eskimo culture at other expositions and special events, Columbia's family and some of their fellow Inuit performers met Seilig director William Mong. He invited the troupe to work in films, initially casting them as extras portraying Seminole and Plains Indians in three one-reel dramas. Then, acting on Columbia's proposed screen story, Mong produced The Way of the Eskimo, which trade publications described at the time of its release in July 1911 as \\"the first of a series of pictures made by Selig in the far north last winter\\". In reality, however, the Eskimo one-reeler was not filmed in either the Arctic or along the northern coast of Labrador; it was shot much farther south in the United States, in Escanaba, Michigan, located about 300 miles due north of Selig's corporate headquarters in Chicago. Situated next to the Little Bay de Noc linked to Lake Michigan, Escanaba with its heavy winter snows and ice-bound shoreline was a more convenient, visually credible alternative to filming in far-off Labrador. Today, nearly a dozen photographs documenting that 1911 filming are preserved by the Delta County Historical Society in Escanaba.\\"Little Bay de Noc: 'The Way of the Eskimo'\\", photographic series A-1958.96.03-15, archives of the Delta County Historical Society, Escanaba, Michigan.

The costs in both time and money to send even a small company of cast and crew all the way to northeastern Canada were probably deemed far too high, especially for the purposes of producing just two one-reelers. To enhance the \\"Arctic\\" realism of filming in Michigan, Monk staged a hunting expedition and killing of a nonindigenous polar bear in Escabana, an event documented among the photographs held today by the noted historical society.\\"Death of the polar bear\\", photograph A-1956.96.08; \\"Cast from the Eskimo movie\\" (including the dead polar bear), A-1956.96.07; online images from archives of the Delta County Historical Society, Escanaba, Michigan.

The project builds on Wolfram's previous research into computational systems, as explored in his self-published book, A New Kind of Science. The project was launched in April 2020 with the main contributors being Stephen Wolfram, Jonathan Gorard and Max Piskunov. A book, A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics, was published about the project in June 2020. Project description Spatial hypergraph of {{x,y},{x,z}}->{{x,z},{x,w},{y,w},{z,w}} iterated 10 times The project is built around exploring simple computational systems that create complex networks of causal relationships. The formalism of the model is that of a discrete spacetime in which space is represented by a hypergraph obeying the rules of an abstract rewriting system. The passage of time is then modeled by the update steps of the rules of the rewriting system. This opens the door to a systematic computational search through the rules that are able to generate a network with features that mirror the laws of physics, thus leading to the project's goal of trying to find \\"the rule of the universe\\". The Wolfram model is said to reproduce key features of both quantum mechanics as well as special and general relativity. In order for the model to present these features, it must exhibit the Church-Rosser property (or \\"causal invariance\\" as Wolfram terms it). Most of the example models come from a rewriting system on ordered graphs; some concepts are illustrated by examples pertaining to string rewriting systems. Many of the computational phenomena obtained in these systems bear analogy to Wolfram's previous investigations into cellular automata. This newly introduced ordered-graph system lends itself to geometrical interpretation in a way that cellular automata did not, and it is mainly these geometrical interpretations that provide an entry point into analogy with physical law. The Wolfram Physics Project is being presented to the public as an open project, where all the technical documentation as well as software tools and live recordings of working sessions on the project are freely accessible to the public. In a controversial move, Wolfram did not seek peer review prior to publishing his work. Stephen Wolfram and Jonathan Gorard have posted preprints on the topic to the arXiv; Gorard's was submitted to the journal Complex Systems, which was founded by Wolfram in 1987. Reception While Stephen Wolfram claims the project has been a success with scientists and others engaging with the project through the livestreamed content, other prominent physicists have leveled criticism at the project. Criticisms of the project center around the apparent non-quantitative aspect of the theory, with noted quantum computing scientist Scott Aaronson stating: \\"It's this sort of infinitely flexible philosophy where, regardless of what anyone said was true about physics, they could then assert, 'Oh, yeah, you could graft something like that onto our model'\\". Wolfram's decision not to seek traditional peer-review was also a point of contention in the physics community. Physicist Sean Carroll commented that \\"it would be more effective to write short papers addressing specific problems with this kind of approach rather than proclaiming a breakthrough without much vetting.\\"  References  External links  * Official site * Technical introduction * Wolfram Physics Project Launch at YouTube Category:Projects established in 2020 Category:Complex systems theory ","title":"Wolfram Physics Project"},{"id":"64077907","text":"6th Missouri Infantry can refer to: * 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Union), Union regiment during the American Civil War * 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Confederate), Confederate regiment during the American Civil War ","title":"6th Missouri Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"64077913","title":"1980 Chicago Marathon"},{"id":"64077914","text":"Derek Michael Chauvin (born 1976) is an American former police officer known for his involvement in the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020. During an arrest made by Chauvin and three other officers, he knelt on George Floyd's neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed, lying face down on the street. The next day, he was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department and was later charged with second-degree murder, third- degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. The incident set off a series of protests around the world.  Early life and education  Chauvin was born in 1976. His mother was a housewife and his father was a certified public accountant. At the age of seven, his parents divorced and were granted joint custody of him. Chauvin attended Park High School in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, but did not finish and later obtained a General Educational Development certificate. He took food preparation courses at Dakota County Technical College and worked as a cook. He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1996 to 2004, including two stints in the military police between 1996 and 2000. During that time, he also attended Inver Hills Community College from 1995 to 1999 and later transferred to Metropolitan State University where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in law enforcement in 2006.  Career  Chauvin was a 19-year Minneapolis Police Department veteran. He received a medal for valor in 2006 for being one of several officers who fired on a suspect who pointed a shotgun at them, and another in 2008 for a domestic- violence incident in which he broke down a door and shot a suspect who reached for his pistol. He received a commendation medal in 2008 after he and his partner tackled a fleeing suspect holding a pistol, and another in 2009 for single-handedly apprehending a group of gang members. Chauvin had 18 complaints on his official record, two of which ended in discipline, including official letters of reprimand. He had been involved in three police shootings, one of which was fatal. According to the former owner of El Nuevo Rodeo, a Latin nightclub, Chauvin had worked there off duty as security while George Floyd was working as a security guard, but was not certain whether they knew each other. She also said he had sometimes used overaggressive tactics when dealing with black clientele, responding to fights by spraying the crowd with mace instead of dealing with those who were fighting.  Killing of George Floyd  On May 25, 2020, Chauvin was one of four officers involved in arresting George Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market and was the field training officer for one of the other officers involved. Security camera footage from a nearby business did not show Floyd resisting the arrest. The criminal complaint stated that, based on body camera footage, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe while standing outside the police car, resisted getting in the car and fell down; he went to the ground face down. While Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes. After Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck, Floyd repeatedly said \\"I can't breathe\\", \\"Mama\\", and \\"please\\". For part of the time, two other officers knelt on Floyd's back. During the final two minutes Floyd was motionless and had no pulse. Several bystanders took videos which were widely circulated and broadcast. Chauvin and the other officers involved were fired the day following the incident. While knee-to-neck restraints are allowed in Minnesota under certain circumstances, Chauvin's use of the technique has been widely criticized by law enforcement experts as excessive. On June 23, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said that Chauvin had been trained in the dangers of positional asphyxiation, and characterized Floyd's death as murder. = Murder charges = Chauvin was arrested on May 29, 2020. Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman charged him with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, making him the first white officer in Minnesota to be charged in the death of a black civilian. Under Minnesota law, third-degree murder is defined as causing another's death without intent to kill, but \\"evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life\\". Second-degree manslaughter also does not imply lethal intent, but that the perpetrator created \\"an unreasonable risk\\" of serious harm or death. On May 31, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison took over the case at the request of Governor Tim Walz. On June 3, Ellison amended the charges against Chauvin to include unintentional second-degree murder under the felony murder doctrine, alleging that Chauvin killed Floyd in the course of committing assault in the third degree; Minnesota sentencing guidelines recommend 12.5 years imprisonment on conviction of that charge. Bail for Chauvin was set at $1.25 million. Prior to Chauvin's arrest, his attorney and prosecutors had made unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a plea bargain to cover both state and federal charges. Additionally, Ellison also charged the three other officers with aiding and abetting second-degree murder with bail set to $1 million. Eight correctional officers at the Ramsey County Jail filed a discrimination complaint against supervisors at the jail with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, alleging that during Chauvin's brief stay before his transfer to a state prison, non-white guards were not allowed to work on the fifth floor where Chauvin was being held. Their complaint also alleged that a guard saw a white lieutenant sit on Chauvin's bed and that she permitted Chauvin to use her cellphone. Responding to the complaint, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said it was opening an investigation to determine whether discrimination took place. Chauvin was released on conditional bail on October 7, 2020 after posting a bond of $1 million. Court documentation provided that, as conditions for his bail, Chauvin's supervised release from prison will be forfeited if he declines to appear before a magistrate, refuses to appear in court on scheduled dates, leaves the state of Minnesota without court approval, or has contact with Floyd's family.https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile- Cases/27-CR-20-12646/NoticeofRelease10072020.pdf Personal life Chauvin married a Laotian immigrant, who competed in a \\"Mrs. Minnesota\\" beauty pageant in 2018. She filed for a divorce the day before he was arrested for Floyd's death. Following the murder charges against him, Chauvin and his wife were charged with multiple felony counts of tax evasion related to allegedly fraudulent tax returns from 2014 to 2019. The Washington County prosecutor's office announced on July 22, 2020 that Chauvin and his wife under-reported joint income by a total of $464,433, including more than $95,000 from Chauvin's off-duty security work. The complaint also alleges failure to pay proper sales tax on a $100,000 BMW purchased in Minnesota in 2018, failure to declare income from Chauvin's wife's business, improperly accounted-for deductions on a rental home, and changing their residency to Florida because \\"it was cheaper to register a car there\\".

Finally, during the time that Brinton spent at Northwestern University in the war years (see below), he was associated with the Chicago Mountaineering Club. He made the first ascent of the eponymous Brinton‚Äôs crack (class 5.6) at Devil‚Äôs Lake, Wisconsin. It is said that during the first ascent, the renowned climber Fritz Wiessner backed off an attempt and then ‚ÄúBrinton climbed to this high point, devised a traverse, and stamped his name on the classic-of-all-classics at Devil‚Äôs Lake‚Äù.Leonard, Brendan (2006).

The actors were promised an honorarium, but it is unclear whether they ever received one. First Winter Crossing by Ski of the Whitney Russell Pass, May 1938 Ski mountaineering continued to be an abiding passion for Brinton. Three trips are particularly noteworthy. In April 1937, Brinton, Muir Dawson, and Dick Jones climbed to Mt. Whitney Pass (13,500‚Äô) on skis.Jones, Richard M. (1938). ‚ÄúSki Ascents on Whitney Crest‚Äù, Sierra Club Bulletin, pp. 106‚Äì107. Then in May 1938, a journey from Whitney Portal to the Upper Kern Canyon and over the Whitney Russell Pass (13,300‚Äô) was undertaken by Brinton, Howard Koster, Dick Jones, Philip Faulconer, and Glen Dawson.Oliver, Bill (2007). ‚ÄúA Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson & Jules Eichorn‚Äù.

San Gorgornio (Keller Peak) ski huts. The first Mt. Baldy ski hut was built in the fall of 1935; it involved the human transport of all building materials from 7100‚Äô to 8300‚Äô on a three-mile trail.

A past sexual encounter with a beautiful alien named Andromeda (Krista Allen) leaves Tim yearning for the opportunity to explore the solar system in an alien spacecraft. In Tim's mind, the only way to do this is to be abducted by aliens. Tim joins a support group called Abductees Anonymous in the hope of finding like-minded individuals, only to find himself surrounded by prior abductees in trauma. Tim's life quickly turns upside down when, after 15 years, Andromeda decides to return to Earth for a visit. Unbeknownst to Tim, Andromeda's trip includes a secret agenda.

He used an Arizona-based crew and nearly all of the actors were based in Arizona, with the exception of some key talent: Baker, Allen, Rose and Bogart. Eleven Eleven was Redish's debut feature film, and Baker's first leading role. In addition to acquiring Charles Baker, the production also acquired Baywatch:Hawaii star Krista Allen. The film takes place in and around the home of the fictitious Tim and Eve Faris. The majority of interiors were shot in a rented house in Gilbert, AZ. The production moved to Sedona to shoot all of the exteriors. Interior and exterior shots were then stitched together either by strategic camera movement, cutaways, and green screen special effects in exterior doorways. Post-production challenges, including critical visual effects, prevented the movie from being completed until 2018.

The gens Istacidia was an obscure Roman family at Pompeii. No members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions. Numerius Istacidius Cilix was one of the municipal duumvirs of Pompeii around the beginning of the first century. The Istacidii were apparently the residents of the famous \\"Villa of the Mysteries\\", and a large sepulchre found along the bay road contains several tombs for members of this family.Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, pp. 411, 412.Gordon, \\"The Ordo of Pompeii\\", p. 174. Origin The Istacidii were most likely of Campanian origin, as all of the inscriptions of this family are from Pompeii,Gordon, \\"The Ordo of Pompeii\\", pp. 167, 173. and one of them bore the surname Campanus, one of a class of surnames derived from place names, and usually indicating a person's place of origin.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Istacidii were Numerius and Lucius, accounting for all of the Istacidii whose praenomina are known, except for one instance of Marcus, found in a filiation. Lucius and Marcus were among the most common of all Roman names at all periods of history, while Numerius was much more distinctive; while not actually rare, it was typical in families of Oscan origin. Branches and cognomina The inscriptions of the Istacidii at Pompeii suggest that they constituted a single family, together with their freedmen. Several inscriptions of this gens do not include a cognomen, and none of the surnames of this gens appear to have been hereditary. Cilix, a surname originally applied to someone from Cilicia, gives the appearance of the type of name belonging to a freedman, and indicating his place of origin; but as it belonged to one of the duumviri, it may instead have stemmed from his trading connections.

Allston Brown (1836‚Äì 1918) in his A History of the New York Stage (1903) wrote at length about the building and its history, stating that it was constructed of corrugated and ridged iron, was fireproof, and was built after the model of the Champs- √âlys√©es in Paris.John Franceschina, Incidental and Dance Music in the American Theatre from 1786 to 1923, Volume 3, BearManor Media (2018) - Google Books The main building was 110 feet in diameter while the dome rose to the height of 75 feet, surmounted by a cupola. The iron roof was affixed to heavy timber posts. The main supports of the dome were a series of columns surmounted by richly ornamented caps. These columns were also cased with corrugated iron. There were three distinct areas for the audience: the orchestra seats, dress circle, and the pit, with a wide promenade in the rear, around the entire circle of seats. The 600 orchestra seats were composed of arm sofas, for which 75 cents was charged. In the rear was the dress circle, in which there was seating capacity for 500 persons. The pit could accommodate, comfortably seated, 600 people. In addition to this, there was standing room in the promenade and other parts of the house capable of accommodating 600 men, making standing room for 1,400 persons, and, when crowded, 2,000 could be packed away. The ring was the largest (with the exception of a travelling show) ever used in the United States, being 43 feet 6 inches, which is 1 foot 6 inches larger than Astley's Amphitheatre in London, and 6 inches bigger than the Cirque Napol√©on at Paris. There were two ring entrances exactly opposite one another; this item alone was a great improvement, both for spectacular pieces and for battoute leaping. There were two entrances to the building, the chief one being a beautiful portico in the shape of an Italian arch 23 feet high and 22 feet in width; within was an interior vestibule 12 feet in depth, with wreathed columns and four niches, in which statues were placed. Over this entrance was the band, which was the dividing line between the 25 cent seats and those costing 50 cents. The structure was among the first in New York to be heated by steam.T.

Music for the performances, everything from equestrian display to ballet and incidental music for dramas and pantomimes, was provided by H. Wayrauch, the resident composer and musical director. The venue immediately became popular with audiences.'The Hippotheatron' - The New York Times, 24 November 1864, Page 5 Spalding & Rogers' Circus, which had just returned from a two years' tour in the seaports of Brazil, Buenos Ayres, Montevideo, and the West Indies, were in residence for four weeks from April 25 to May 21 1864,William L.

He changed its name to 'Lent's New York Circus' on 6 November and continued the season until 27 May 1866; it was reopened by Lent on 24 September 1866. It had been announced to open on 11 September, but the epizootic prevailed to such an extent among the horses that he was compelled to defer it. During the summer recess many improvements were made in the building. The earth was excavated, the ring and surrounding seats lowered, and a hanging gallery added, thereby materially increasing the seating capacity of the auditorium. Underneath the raised seats the dens of animals and museum curiosities were placed. The front entrance was materially improved by alterations, and a large false front, entirely concealing the iron building from view, was erected and covered with large oil paintings, characteristic of the entertainments within, and the season ended on 4 May 1867.

Lent remained as manager until 1872. The name 'Hippotheatron' was taken from the Greek 'Hippo' (·ºµœÄœÄŒøœÇ - horse) and 'theatron' (Œ∏Œ≠Œ±œÑœÅŒøŒΩ - a theatre/viewing place for spectators). In the summer of 1872 the Hippotheatron was sold to P. T. Barnum, who opened it on 18 November 1872 with the pantomime Bluebeard. Destruction The Hippotheatron was destroyed by fire on 24 December 1872. The blaze was first discovered at four o'clock in the morning having been caused by an escape of gas. Despite the gas main being turned off jets of flame were still seen shooting out from among the ruined structure. Fire engines were quickly on the scene.'Barnum's Last Disaster' - The Sun, New York, December 26, 1872, p. 1 The walls of the building, which were of thin corrugated iron, became quickly heated by the fierce flames at their base, and helped not only to spread flames, but engendered so great a heat that the firemen could not enter the building. During the winter months the Barnum circus came off the road and the animals were housed at the Hippotheatron.Stuart Thayer and William L. Slout, Grand Entree: The Birth of the Greatest Show on Earth, 1870-1875, Emeritus Enterprise Book (1998) - Google Books p. 47 When the fire broke out the animals in their cages began to show signs of fear, and their excitement increased with the noise and heat of the fire. Charles Wells, a keeper among those who slept on the premises near the animal cages, said that he and two others went to the giraffes' cage to break them out but the fire had reached the cage and the men only succeeded in getting a giraffe partly out when it was caught by the flames and sank to the ground. Other animals dashed with terrific force against the sides of their cages, vainly endeavoring to regain their liberty. There were three elephants in the building, confined by chains fastened to the floor. As the fire grew hotter the bears, lions, and leopards were seen with their paws endeavoring to wrench the iron bars of their cages asunder, and, as the flames or heat prevented their keepers from rescuing them, they were abandoned to their fate. None of the keepers had the keys of any of the cages, otherwise some of the animals could have been saved. All the performers lost their wardrobes, and all the dresses which had been made for Bluebeard were likewise consumed. A number of valuable trained dogs belonging to Charles White were also burned.

History View of the square, May 2020 The beginnings of the Bia≈Çystok Market Square date back to the 15th century. It was created at the intersection of roads leading to Sura≈º, Wasilk√≥w and Choroszcz. With time around spontaneously created square, without a clearly defined plan, buildings began to grow. About In 1547, in the south-eastern part of it, a wooden church was built, in place of the present buildings of the monastery of the Sisters of Mercy. In 1708, the square was given its final shape. Its elongated, slightly curved frontage -south and north - they narrowed at the central point of the square so that it divided into two parts. The first of them eastern, clearly associated with the royal residence. The area was occupied of parish church there. Over time, the most important foundations appeared next to him Branicki - monastery and hospital. The second part ‚Äì the west, with a centrally located town hall, was associated with city functionsRynek Kosciuszki. Work started in 1726 and was interrupted two great fires in 1753. Most the northern part of the city was destroyed. By rebuilding the Market Square, Jan Klemens Branicki made sure that its buildings were harmonious. All buildings were made of brick or were made of brick front wall. Street inlets were highlighted with representative, two- story houses. At the corners of Wasilkowska Street (now Sienkiewicza) stood the tenement house \\"Pod ≈Åosiem\\" and manor house (currently Astoria restaurant). In 1919, the market was named after Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. In 1925 they were made in this parts of the city center cleaning works. After the occupation of Bialystok by the Soviets, the market radically changed its face. First, in 1940, its name was changed. Along with ul. Pi≈Çsudskiego (Lipowa) and Kili≈Ñskiego were changed Sovetskaya Street. After the occupation of Bialystok by the Germans the square once again changed its name to Gross Markt (Great Market). In the years 1941‚Äì1944 the entire downtown of Bia≈Çystok was destroyed as well as most of the buildings in the square. View of the square, August 2019 The reconstruction was carried out in the years 1945‚Äì1958. The main authors were W≈Çadys≈Çaw Paszkowski and Stanis≈Çaw Bukowski. Initially, the work was carried out in an uncoordinated manner. Some of the buildings on the northern frontage were rebuilt using the economic method, while the afternoon frontage was filled with buildings in the style of classicizing modernism. It wasn't until 1955 that Stanis≈Çaw Bukowski, together with Zenon Filipczuk, began to organize the market buildings. As a result, their actions were rebuilt in the western and northern part in the spirit of historicism, referring to the architecture of the 1920s. In the northern frontage, the most interesting buildings should be reconstructed according to projects Stanisaw Bukowski and Zenon Filipczuk: the armory, which housed the State Archives in Bialystok and the Astoria restaurant. On the other side, Sienkiewicza Street, there is a building from the People's Republic of Poland period, the former seat of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Society and the International Press Club and the EMPiK. In the eastern part of the southern frontage, the reconstructed monastery of the Sisters of Mercy, called the House of St. Marcin, and in its central part, a modernist bank building, with a staircase and front projection decoration, reminiscent of the Art Deco style, and the realist socialism building of PPede, the first department store in Bia≈Çystok. The western part is made up of five post-war tenement houses in the historicist style, which were decorated in the 1970s with the sgraffito technique.

It was compiled by the monk from 1040 to 1043, and consists of 3 volumes with 129 chapters, 2 of which are missing. The collection is intended to promote the Lotus Sutra with tales of miraculous events linked to the sutra. Origin In the introduction to the book, Chingen referred to a now-lost collection of tales by the Chinese monk Yiji (Áæ©ÂØÇ), Fahua yanji (Ê≥ïËèØÈ®ìË®ò), which may be the inspiration for this collection. Some scholars suggest that text referred to may be by a Korean monk with the same name in Chinese ≈¨ij≈èk (Áæ©ÂØÇ), although Chingen may have consulted both the Chinese and Korean collections. The tales he collected, however, are Japanese only, which Chingen noted in the preface are meant for ordinary people rather than priests and scholars. Hokke Genki incorporates stories and biographies from other works, such as , and Nihon Ry≈çiki, but also include tales not found in earlier works. Content Chingen organised his tales roughly chronologically from the time of Prince Sh≈çtoku in chapters that are based on the seven groups of the Buddhist order, such as bodhisattva, monks, male novices, nuns, laymen and laywomen, and animals and other non- human entities. The collection contains setsuwa tales or biographical stories of advocates and devotees (jiky≈çsha, ÊåÅÁµåËÄÖ) of the Lotus Sutra, many of them in the Heian period. Most of them (over 90 out of 127) feature in some way Buddhist ascetics or who lived in the mountains. 31 of the tales involve laymen and warriors. In this collection, the worship of Japanese gods and Buddha is given in syncretic manner, and some Japanese deities appear as boddhisatvas. There are two general categories of setsuwa. The first describes the activities of the devotees and their observances of the precepts of the Lotus Sutra. The second involves miraculous tales that illustrate the power of the Lotus Sutra. A notable example of the folktales in the collection is the first appearance of the story of Anchin and Kiyohime, although neither were specifically named in the story. The collection of tales is intended to promote the Lotus Sutra, emphasising stories of people as well as animals and supernatural beings who had experienced miracles in relation to the Lotus Sutra, suggesting that believers can benefit by copying, reciting and their devotion to the sutra. Translation The collection has been translated into English by Yoshiko K. Dykstra and published as Miraculous Tales of the Lotus Sutra from Ancient Japan: The Dainihonkoku Hokekyokenki of Priest Chingen.

On September 7, 1900, a detachment led by Tserpitsky occupied the railway station. Beitan station, which served as the beginning of a general assault, which ended on the same day with the capture of all the forts of the fortress. On September 11, Tserpitsky again set off on a campaign, towards Lutai, with the goal of occupying the Chinese railway Tonka-Shanghai- Huan-Yingkou. Occupying w. d.

On October 26, 1900, Major General Tserpitsky was appointed head of the South Manchurian detachment. In late summer and early fall of 1901, Russian troops organized and conducted operations in northern Manchuria to capture the last remaining leaders of the hunhuz movement. Back in May, the general leadership of these operations was assigned to the commander of the 2nd Siberian Corps, Lieutenant General A.V. Kaulbars, with the subordination of Lieutenant General Tserpitsky and the troops of the South Manchurian Detachment to him during the hostilities. Even before these operations against the leaders of the Chinese rebel movement, General Tserpitsky, several private operations were carried out against the Hunhuz in southern Manchuria. The result of these actions was the capture of the Chinese general Sheu and the surrender of yet another leader of the Hunhus Fulango.

The statue was made by renowned Soviet sculptor Sergey Merkurov. It was installed in 1923 at the end of Tverskoy Boulevard.  History  On 12 April 1922 Presidium of Mossovet issued a resolution to erect a monument to Timiryazev as a part of Lenin's plan of monumental propaganda. This statue was installed at the end of Tverskoy Boulevard. There were ruins of the building which was almost destroyed during the Revolution, but for the construction of this monument it was completely demolished and replaced by a park. The architectural design was assigned to architect Dmitry Osipov. During World War II a bomb fell near the statue and it had been dropped from the monument. It was re-installed, but you can see that it is chipped in two places. thumb Timiryazev's statue belongs to the period of Sergey Merkurov's creative peak. The statue is particularly interesting in context of the Merkurov's art because it was state order but at that time there were no clear and strict idea what an artist should represent compared to the latter period, which gave him more freedom. K.Min, who visited the workshop of Merkurov, wrote that the sculptor worked on this statue with the help of three apprentices, which shows us the scale and complexity of this project. The whole process of creating this statue took Merkurov almost a year. It was especially complicated because of the material ‚Äî Swedish granite.  Description  Merkurov's creative method is close to the method of ancient sculptors because material dictates the form. He had to work with two blocks of granite of imperfect and difficult forms, which forced him to elongate proportions of the statue. Detail of the monument The square, where the monument is situated, is marked by sculptures of microscopes which resemble avant-garde architectones. The pedestal of the statue presents an arrangement of cubical forms: a large parallelepiped is placed on four smaller cubes, which lock into two displaced plates. On a pedestal there is a relief of the curve of assimilation dependence on sunlight, defined by Timiryazev in his work on plant physiology, and the inscription: ¬´K. A. Timiryazev ‚Äî warrior and thinker¬ª. This monumental composition is very geometrical and solid. This characteristics create a strong sense of tectonics and firmness. The figure of Timiryazev rises above the square as a column. He is presented in the mantle of a doctor at the University of Cambridge, which elongates his silhouette and makes him look like a Scandinavian warrior. He stands in a very steady posture with his hands locked together. The body is simplified whereas the face is realistic. All the details reduced to their minimum in order to guide our attention to the Timiryazev's face and hands, at the same time, preserving the overall impression of the monument as a whole. Solidity and monumentalism are emphasised by the dark grey colour of granite. This sculptural composition shows us a great example of the synthesis of architecture and sculpture. It was perfectly included into the city's context and it still looks as if it was meant to be there. The forms of the statue beautify blend with the forms of modernist TASS building, which was built there in the 1970s. It is not surprising that the quality of this monument was appreciated and praised by other sculptors.  Reception  168x168px Soviet sculptor Nikolay Nikogosyan wrote that this is one of the best monuments in Moscow and Merkurov's greatest work. However, not everybody was amazed by this artwork, some people critiqued the choice of Timiryazev, because they thought he was chosen not because of his talents as scientist but because of his political beliefs. Others found it to be excessively \\"formalistic\\" and too much influenced by western art. Indeed this piece bears traces of the influence of French and German sculptors. Simplified and solid forms recall associations with the work of Georg Kolbe and Ernst Barlach.  References  Sources  * Vinogradov N.

Michael Treshow V, was a Danish mechanical engineer who had learnt shipbuilding in Copenhagen, who went on to work on Project Orion. Orion's specialist in bomb delivery was Michael Treshow, a Danish mechanical engineer who had been trained in shipbuilding in Copenhagen before visiting the United States in 1920 and becoming a permanent resident in 1929. He was born 4 December 1894, in Copenhagen. He came over from Denmark to Southern California. He married a woman called Elsa. He moved from Malibu to Del Mar. Hoover Dam Treshow was hired as a designer of construction tools, to work on the Hoover Dam. During the construction of the Boulder (now Hoover) Dam between 1930 and 1936 he designed and supervised the installation of the equipment that pumped concrete - more than 8 million tons of it - from where it was mixed to the dam site. \\"Something over a mile as I recall,\\" says his son, Ken. Treshow switched to nuclear reactor design and engineering after World War II. Argonne National Laboratory He received Q clearance in 1950, while working as a senior engineer at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, and held some twenty patents in several fields. Treshow was Project Engineer on the Reactor Engineering Division for the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR) (April 1956). ALPR Preliminary Design Study (Argonne Low Power Reactor) phase I General specifications were taken from Treshow's earlier study of a smaller, but similar power plant (May 1955). Design study of a nuclear power plant for 100-KW electric and 400-kw heat capacity \\"I am recognized as having an unusual talent for invention and development of new ideas and products,\\" he wrote to Ed Creutz in November 1956, seeking a position at General Atomic, ‚Äú3 1/2 years from now at age 65 I will compelled to retire from Argonne due to forced retirement rules. I feel this would be too early for me.\\"Argonne National Laboratory Index of Patents Issued from the United States Patent Office Atomic Industry Reporter, Part 1 Committee prints, Part 1  Project Orion  Treshow was hired by General Atomic in February 1958, at age sixty- four, taking a position as a senior design specialist, with Ed Creutz making special arrangements to bend the company's retirement policies so that he could keep working as long as he wished. He soon joined the Orion team, drawing upon his training as a marine engineer and naval architect to produce detailed plans for the various components and permutations of the Orion ship. \\"He drew beautiful pictures with loving care and was very meticulous,\\" says Freeman. \\"He was an old-fashioned draftsman, and loved to make everything exact.\\" Michael Treshow co-wrote a paper ‚ÄúFeasibility Study of a Nuclear Bomb- Propelled Space Vehicle, Interim Annual Report‚Äù, 1 July 1958- 1 June 1959, written by Brian Dunne, Freeman Dyson and Michael Treshow, edited by Ted Taylor, who remembers this as the document that \\"turned on the Air Force,\\" including Mike May, later director of Livermore, who said \\"it was the best progress report he had ever seen.\\" It remains classified S-RD. \\"It only covers the first year; but if I had to choose one document for declassification, that would be the one,\\" says Ted. Michael Treshow devoted his attention to everything from shock absorbers to parametric design studies that laid out the broad range of possible vehicles, from 200 to 10,000 tons. His drawings, few of which have been declassified, are remembered as exquisitely detailed. \\"The ship was about 120 feet high it was big, like a ten-story building,\\" says Freeman, describing the earliest version. \\"It was just a big flat dome, it wasn't particularly aerodynamic. It was so heavy it did not matter. The bottom 20 feet or so were mostly shock absorbers and then above that you had machinery borrowed from the Coca-Cola Company for the hadnling of the bombs, like a Coke machine where you put in a quater and get out a Coke bottle. The bombs are arranged in racks and are shunted along; as each one was used the next one would move in. They came in a regular sequence and then they would get snapped into the catapult that launched them down the middle. So that occupied the next 30 feet or so. And then above that you had the dining room and sleeping quarters for the crew.\\" A successful Orion launch would depend upon being able to select exactly the right flavor of bomb at exactly the right time. Although the link to Coca-Cola may have become exaggerated, bottle-handing equipment was definitely involved. \\"Oh yes, the Coca-Cola people did come,\\" confirms Freeman. \\"We had interesting conversations with a lot of people, and many of them had to be in an unclassified context,\\" says Ted. \\"One major source of information was the Coca-Cola Company, where we got detailed descriptions of how they set up mass production systems for Coke bottles and all kinds of mechanical stuff.\\" Jerry Astl remembers the ejection system with Michael Treshow. \\"I saw the drawings and we discussed it. I agreed with him one hundred percent. He didn't design that, he said, why should I bother? Vending machines already have something like that, and it works and is well proven. All we need is to make a few changes to make it sturdier, and what he had was pretty damm good-looking.\\"Project Orion - George Dyson classe.cornell.edu Patents Michael has several patents. * Reflector control of a boiling water reactorReflector control of a boiling water reactor Nuclear Science Abstracts * Fuel subassembly construction for radial flow in a nuclear reactorFuel subassembly construction for radial flow in a nuclear reactor * Kiln supporting meansKiln supporting means * Device for curing and cooling burned materials in rotary kilnsDevice for curing and cooling burned materials in rotary kilns * A Preliminary Study of Superheating Boiling ReactorsA Preliminary Study of Superheating Boiling Reactors * A study of heavy water central station boiling reactorsA study of heavy water central station boiling reactors * Nuclear reactorNuclear reactor * Design study of small boiling reactors for power and heat production (November 1954) Design study of small boiling reactors for power and heat production (November 1954) * Design study of a nuclear power plant for 100-kw electric and 400-kw heat capacity (May 1955) Design study of a nuclear power plant for 100-kw electric and 400-kw heat capacity * ALPR preliminary design study (April 1956) ALPR preliminary design study (April 1956) * A study of heavy water central station boiling reactors (CSBR) (September 1958) A study of heavy water central station boiling reactors (CSBR) (September 1958) * Design of the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR) (May 1961)Design of the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR) (May 1961) Death Michael died on 26th January 1986 at 91 years old.deseret.com References Category:1894 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Danish emigrants to the United States ","title":"Mike Treshow"},{"id":"64078420","text":"Rikke Dybdahl (born 21 July 1997) is a Danish footballer who plays as a forward for FC Thy-Thisted Q and for the Denmark women's national under-23 football team.

Pioneers!) is a 1950 American black-and-white short drama film produced by Paul F. Heard for the Protestant Film Commission. Directed by William Beaudine, it stars Colleen Townsend, Tom Powers, Sarah Padden, and Regis Toomey. The story is set in the fictional town of Fairview and depicts the friction between the middle-class residents and the impoverished migrants who live on the outskirts in a shantytown called \\"The Patch\\". The film explores the meaning of the American Dream for both types of residents, and the responsibility of the church to reinstill Christian values of human dignity and freedom into American life. The film was produced at the request of the Home Missions Council of North America. It was not released commercially, but was distributed to 30,000 Protestant denominational churches in the United States. Plot Ken Keeler (Tom Powers), a prominent attorney, believes along with other leading citizens of Fairview that the families of \\"The Patch\\", a migrant shantytown on the outskirts of the town, should not be encouraged to stay. When a proposal is made that the migrant children should be allowed to attend school in the town, a citizens' meeting goes into an uproar. The town doctor warns that with the lack of sanitation and prevalence of disease in the migrant camp, the whole town will be infected by such a move. Ken's daughter Sallie (Colleen Townsend), a member of a church youth group that conducts classes for the migrants and fights for their rights, insists that the town should reach out and help their poorer neighbors like good Christians, but hers is a lone voice. The citizens' committee appoints Ken to find a solution and to report back in two weeks. Meanwhile, a new migrant family has arrived in The Patch. The mother, Ma Ashby (Sarah Padden), is hopeful about her husband finding work and the family becoming part of the community, but they are shunned by the townsfolk and taken advantage of by the owner of the dilapidated shack. The Ashby family attempts to attend church on Sunday, but they are stared at by the more well-dressed townsfolk and when they finally reach the steps, the church door is closed on them. Inside the church, Ken struggles with his conscience, hearing both the minister‚Äôs sermon about helping one‚Äôs neighbor and his neighbors‚Äô invective against the migrants. After the service, Ken accepts a ride from Christian missionary Dave Harley (Regis Toomey), who takes him on a trip of discovery to show him what is really happening in America of 1950. He shows Ken the squalid shantytown and also the acres of shiny new housing developments built for the huge numbers of people seeking to put down roots. These modern developments lack any sign of a church, and so are losing touch with the Christian values on which America was founded. Back at the Keeler home, Ken's son Kenny (Larry Olsen) invites his new friend Nathaniel Ashby (Jimmy Hunt) to join his baseball team, but his teammates make fun of the migrant boy and Kenny's older brother Malcolm (Larry Carr) throws Nathaniel off their premises. When Ken finds out he is livid, and goes to apologize to the Ashby family. Seeing the squalor in which they live, he wants to give them a check, but Ma Ashby refuses to take charity. Instead, she asks him to join them at their Sunday church meeting in the shantytown, and Ken and Sallie attend. Ken reports back to the citizens' committee that instead of throwing out the migrants, they should help them. Sallie listens with pride as Ken sets forth his plan of action. Even though the town is slowly warming to Ken's ideas, the final scene shows the Ashby family on the move again, hoping that the next town they come to will be welcoming. Ma Ashby's voice is heard intoning Psalm 23, \\"The Lord is my Shepherd\\", as the film fades out. Themes The film promotes the \\"Methodist theme of duty to the underprivileged\\", and also the idea that \\"charity in missions begins at home\\". The concept of the American Dream is examined in both its moral and materialistic meanings. Allusions to communism as a threat to the American Dream are also found in the script. The film and its title make the comparison between the waves of American pioneers who traversed the country by covered wagon in search of new frontiers, and the estimated 70 million modern-day Americans who are constantly on the move in search of jobs. The film asserts that American society was founded on the Christian values of human dignity and freedom, but \\"the Christian aspect is withering principally because the church as a whole has lost its outreach\\". Cast *Colleen Townsend as Sallie Keeler *Tom Powers as Ken Keeler *Sarah Padden as Ma Ashby *Regis Toomey as Dave Harley *Jimmy Hunt as Nathaniel *Evelyn Brent as Alice Keeler *Larry Olsen as Kenny Keeler *Larry Carr as Malcolm Keeler *Erville Alderson as Pa Ashby *Peggy Wynne as Arla Ashby *Melinda Plowman as Rebecca Ashby ProductionDevelopment= Again Pioneers was developed at the request of the Home Missions Council of North America. The film was intended to \\"provide inspiration for home missions work by the churches\\". The original screenplay by Oviatt McConnell included additional sequences by Alan Shilin. =Casting= The production tapped a number of notable film and stage actors. Heading the cast is Colleen Townsend, who had left her Hollywood film career and was studying theology at Pasadena College; this was her first appearance in a religious film. Other notable performers are Tom Power, Sarah Padden, Regis Toomey, and Evelyn Brent. This was Brent's last film. =Filming= Filming took place at MGM Studios and Nassour Studios in Los Angeles. Director William Beaudine typically completed principal photography on films for the Protestant Film Commission in under a week. The production budget was $80,000. Fourteen Protestant denominations provided the funding. Release Again Pioneers was released on November 6, 1950, in 100 cities. It was not released commercially, but was distributed to denominational churches, with an eventual reach of 30,000 churches. Critical reception Hollywood syndicated columnist Jimmie Fidler mentioned the film in two separate columns. In early November 1950, Fidler wrote that after attending a preview of the film: > I haven't been able to get it out of mind since. Its emotional sock is > terrific... It is precisely the kind of picture that countless millions have > been searching for in their theaters‚Äîand failing to find. It is also proof > positive of the truth inherent in that often-voiced claim that the screen > can be the greatest of all educational mediums. A few weeks later, Fidler wrote that he had sought the reason why the film had \\"left an indelible impression on my mind\\". He reported that the film's technical director, Dr. Frederick Thorne, an ordained Presbyterian minister, had personally traveled to a migrant shantytown in Bakersfield, California, and lived among the residents in order to provide factual details for the script. Fidler concluded: \\"It's amazing to me that more studios do not insist on original research. At least half of Hollywood's sub-par product, in my opinion, can be charged off to the fact that the screenplays are written by men who have had little or no personal experience with the conditions about which they are obliged to write\\". The Cincinnati Enquirer called the film \\"definitely educational propaganda\\", with typecast characterizations that were \\"convincing albeit obviously mechanical\\". Yet this review commended the filmmakers for basically telling the church denominations that sponsored the production that they \\"are not doing their jobs\\". It elaborated: > Churchgoers are not fighting barriers of hate, suspicion, fear of economic > competition, mountains of exploitation, race prejudice and other powerful, > if not physical, obstacles new pioneers face....But if the American dream is > to be fought for and maintained, obstacles must be overcome by restoring to > all belief in the church-contributed spiritual base of the dream‚Äîbelief in > equal rights, freedom and dignity of all individuals as children of God. Lindvall and Quicke note that the film employs the same \\"parallel editing\\" style pioneered by D. W. Griffith to contrast the lifestyle of the middle- class Keeler family with that of the poor migrant Ashby family.

Riddle Peak is situated on the Glacier Peak Wilderness boundary, six miles west of Lake Chelan, and northeast of Holden, on land managed by the Wenatchee National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Flora Mountain, to the northeast, and Martin Peak lies to the west-northwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Lake Chelan via Railroad Creek, Riddle Creek, and Devore Creek. Topographic relief is significant since the southern aspect of the mountain rises 5,000 feet above the Railroad Creek valley in approximately . The first ascent of the peak was made September 11, 1940, by Everett and Ida Zacher Darr, Joe Leuthold, and Eldon Metzger via an easy ridge from Tenmile Pass. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Riddle Peaks is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Riddle Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west-southwest of Martin Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Murray created a series of multi- lingual, accessible infographics to communicate information about coronavirus disease.  Early life and education  Murray earned her bachelor's degree in biology at McGill University. She moved to the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, where she completed a Master of Public Health. After graduating, Murray moved to Massachusetts, where she joined Harvard University for graduate research; along the way earning a master's degree in biostatistics. Murray eventually completed her doctorate in science at Harvard University. She studied the use of agent-based models in clinical decision making. Murray earned her doctoral degree in 2016 and was subsequently appointed a postdoctoral researcher. Her research considered causal inference as a means to improve evidence-based decision making in clinical medicine.  Research and career  In 2019 Murray joined Boston University as an Assistant Professor. Decision making in clinical medicine and public health requires complicated choices between treatment pathways. To evaluate the most effective approach, physicians typically make use of observational data and randomized controlled trials, but in the absence of these, decisions can be made using a agent-based models or individual-level simulation model. Of these, agent-based models are more versatile; they can combine data from various sources to make more generalised inferences. Murray applies these models to a variety of medical conditions, including HIV, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Murray became well-known for her use of social media, where she shares complex epidemiological concepts using Twitter threads and GIFs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Murray partnered with Benjamin Linas to create a series of resources for the general public. The resources included an infographic on what to do if you have a positive test, contact tracing, and how to talk about coronavirus disease to children. She shared the resources through GitHub and they were translated into several different languages. She argued that the epidemiology community should use the attention they received during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people understand what epidemiologists do. She was regularly interviewed by the media, explaining concepts such as herd immunity, social distancing, and how to travel safely in a post-pandemic world. As the pandemic progressed, people wanted information at faster rate than science was generating answers. Murray used social media to explain research findings and to debunk coronavirus-related pseudoscience. Amidst the confusion and misinformation, Murray collated a list of reputable coronavirus disease experts who were active on Twitter. In particular, people looked to understand what was and wasn't safe to do as the world opened up from lockdown. Murray explained that everyone faced a spectrum of risk, and that people had to learn how to assess what level of risk they were happy to take. As the virus spread around the world, fashion designers started to create novel face masks. Murray expressed her concern that designer face shields may not be effective in stopping the movement of SARS-CoV-2 through the air and my only act to change their direction.

Dominic Cummings and Paul Goodman claim Woodcock was a key person to the success of the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit. BiographyEarly life= Woodcock was born in 1987.. She began her post-school studies at the University of Southampton in 2005 and achieved a BSc degree in Sociology and Social Policy in 2008. She went on to complete an MSc in Social Statistics in 2010. =Government= Woodcock's early career was as a civil servant in the Department of Education where she worked on a variety of policies including Schools, Academies and the Spending Review. She became Private Secretary to the Secretary of State and then took a role as Strategic Analyst. From 2014 she worked for a while as adviser to the Government Chief Whip. From 2015 she advised the Head of Strategic Events, delivering and coordinating the VE Day 70th anniversary celebrations. =Vote Leave= Woodcock both the Company Secretary and operations director for the Vote Leave campaign. Dominic Cummings has credited Woodcock with being the most indispensable person in the campaign. Woodcock was responsible for managing the creation of the Voter Intention Collection System (VICS), a bespoke canvassing software system used to model and target the campaign. She has been described as pivotal to the running of Vote Leave, and noted for not seeking the limelight. In March 2017 with the Electoral Commission opening as investigation into particular donations relating to Vote Leave an account by the name Victoria Woodcock deleted computer files useful to the investigation from the shared drive. Woodcock stated in June 2018 that the account was an administrative one that she had used to set up the drive and that she had handed over access to Vote Leave on 17 March 2017 at a point in time prior to the deletions taking place and did not have access to the drive at that time. Paul Goodman blogging in Conservative Home also claims Woodcock was responsible at the last minute for indentifying that Vote Leave's application to run the leave campaign had not been drafted against the assessed criteria, and without a rewrite against that criteria vote Leave would have lost out against the BeLeave with, in Goodman's opinion, the consequence the Britain Stronger in Europe would have prevailed to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union. In 2019 the drama Brexit: The Uncivil War depicted the activity of the Vote Leave campaign. Woodcock was played by Kate O'Flynn in the drama. =Subsequent career= Woodcock moved on to become Programme Director at the software company Sage.

They were first laid out in the early 12th century by the Almoravid dynasty which founded the city in 1070 CE as their new capital. The walls have since been expanded several times by the addition of the Kasbah to the south at the end of the 13th century and by the later extension of the walls to encompass the neighbourhood around the Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes. The Gates of Marrakesh were for the most part established since the original Almoravid construction of the city walls but most have been modified during later periods. Other gates were also added when the Almohads created the Kasbah, which itself has been expanded and re-worked many times since.  History  left = Almoravid foundation (11th-12th centuries) = alt=Marrakesh was founded in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the early leader of the Almoravids. At first, the city's only major fortification was the Ksar al-Hajjar (\\"Palace/Fortress of Stone\\"), a royal citadel built by Abu Bakr to protect the treasury. It was located right next to the site of the current Kutubiyya Mosque in the western part of the city. Like other kasbahs of its time, it probably occupied a quadrangular area and is assumed to have had multiple gates (of which the western gate may have roughly corresponded to the later Bab al-Makhzen gate in the city walls). Excavations in the 20th-century revealed that the citadel's southern side was 218 metres long, indicating a fairly large structure. It was the first monumental structure built by the Almoravids and marked their definitive transition from a nomadic Saharan people to an empire with a fixed base. It was only in 1126 that Ali ibn Yusuf, a later Almoravid amir, decided to surround the city with a full circuit of walls. The decision to fortify the city with ramparts was likely due to rising threat of the Almohads at the time. Abu-l-Walid ibn Rushd, a qadi from Cordoba and the grandfather of the famous Ibn Rushd (Averroes), was reportedly the one who convinced the amir to undertake the construction. Historical sources also claim that construction took only 8 months and cost 70,000 gold dinars. Prior to construction, the path of the walls was laid out with ropes and the amir's astrologers were consulted for the most propitious date on which to start. The main outline of the medina's walls today is still broadly that of the original Almoravid walls, although with notable differences to the north and south. The resulting walled area formed an irregular polygon of vaguely quadrangular shape. Some of the irregularities in this outline may have been due to existing cemeteries and religious sites or to last-minute decisions to include more land within the walls. Many of the city's main gates also date back to this period ‚Äî at least in their locations if not necessarily in their current forms and names. These gates were, in clockwise order starting from the northeast: Bab Fes (later known as Bab el-Khemis), Bab Debbagh, Bab Aylan, Bab Aghmat, Bab Yintan, Bab as-Saliha, Bab Neffis (probably the predecessor of Bab er-Robb today), Bab ash-Shari'a, Bab al-Makhzen, Bab el-'Arissa (also known as Bab ar- Raha), Bab Doukkala, Bab Moussoufa, and Bab Taghzout. Four of these gates ‚Äî Bab ash-Shari'a, Bab Moussoufa, Bab Yintan, and Bab as-Saliha ‚Äî disappeared some time ago and are only known from historical texts or from vestigial physical evidence. kasbah, south of Bab Agnaoualt= = Almohad period (late 12th to 13th centuries) = When the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min conquered Marrakesh in 1147 he reportedly destroyed many Almoravid monuments (especially mosques) but the Ksar el-Hajjar and the palace of Ali ibn Yusuf were still used as the official residence of the new Almohad rulers for a time. The Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur (ruled 1184-1199), however, embarked on an ambitious construction project to create a vast new royal district, the Kasbah, attached to the south side of the city. Its creation was motivated in part by the rapid growth of the city's population and an urgent need for more space within the city. However it may also have been motivated by the Almohad caliph's desire to follow the example of other powerful Islamic rulers who built separate palace-cities from which to rule, such as the Ummayyad construction of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba or the Abbasid construction of Samarra in Iraq. Construction of the kasbah began in 1185 and finished by 1190. The current western and southern outline of the kasbah today, including its walls, most likely still date back essentially to the Almohad construction. The kasbah's main gate was Bab Agnaou: both a defensive and a ceremonial gateway, located just inside the city walls near Bab er-Robb (Bab Neffis) and forming the main public access to the kasbah for the city's residents. The Almohads also established vast pleasure gardens around the kasbah such as the Agdal Gardens to the south which were surrounded by their own walls. = The Saadian and Alaouite periods (15th century and after) = Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman to protect the western flank of the Agdal Gardensalt= Following the demise of the Almohad regime, Marrakesh as a whole fell into decline. The following Marinid dynasty made Fes their capital and carried out few major constructions in Marrakesh. It wasn't until the Saadian Dynasty (16th century to early 17th century) established Marrakesh as their capital that the city saw a resurgence. The Saadians renovated the kasbah and expanded its northern outline slightly with new palaces such as El Badi. Sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib also transferred the Jewish population of the city to a new Mellah district on the east side of the Royal Palace, expanding the eastern outline of the kasbah in the process. Sultan Ahmad al- Mansur also renovated and replanted the Agdal Gardens, thus maintaining this large walled enclosure to the south of the city. The Saadians, and their successors the Alaouites, also sponsored the construction and expansion of the zawiya and mosque complex around the mausoleum of Sidi Bel Abbes, which was located just outside the northern gate of the city, Bab Taghzout. Sidi Bel Abbes is often considered the patron saint of Marrakesh and his zawiya attracted more and more settlers to the area until a flourishing neighbourhood developed here outside the walls of the city. In the 18th century, under the reign of the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah, the walls of the city were finally extended to encompass this neighbourhood, forming the new northern point of the city. This constituted the last major extension and modification of the city walls. Other works by Alaouite sultans still added to the existing walls and gates of the city. Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah is also responsible for much of the construction and redevelopment of the royal palace (Dar al- Makhzen) following years of neglect, giving it more or less its present-day form. The southern side of the Kasbah was expanded to accommodate new gardens, new neighbourhoods for palace servants and troops, and a series of walled squares known as mechouars (an official square/courtyard at the entrance of a royal palace). A multitude of gates were built to regulate passage between these new southern annexes. Many of them are of minor architectural interest, though Bab Ahmar (the easternmost gate) has a unique design that includes an elevated platform for light artillery. Lastly, following its destruction by the Rehamna in 1862, the western wall of the Agdal Gardens was rebuilt by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman. At the same time, the sultan added a fort called Sqallat al-Mrabit to defend this part of the ramparts.  Description and design of the walls  Example of a well-maintained section of the city walls The walls have a fairly regular construction typical of medieval Morocco and al-Andalus, standing between 6 and 8 meters in height and fortified every 25 to 30 meters by square towers or bastions. The walls vary between 1.4 and 2 meters in thickness, while the towers vary in thickness between 8 and 14 meters. Originally the walls were topped by a narrow path (wall walk) which was protected by battlements with merlons, though many of these have since disappeared. There is evidence that the walls were originally surrounded by a ditch or moat, though this may not have played a significant defensive role.  Constructions methods and maintenance  General example of alt= pis√© wall in Fes The walls of Marrakesh, like those of Fes and most historic cities in Morocco, were built in rammed earth, an ancient building technique found across the Near East, Africa, and beyond.\\"Pis√©\\", in The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 5th edition (1998). p.439 It is also known as \\"pis√©\\" (from French) or \\"tabia\\" (from Arabic). It generally made use of local materials and was widely used thanks to its low cost and relative efficiency. This material consisted of mud and soil of varying consistency (everything from smooth clay to rocky soil) usually mixed with other materials such as straw or lime to aid adhesion. The addition of lime also made the walls harder and more resistant overall, although this varied locally as some areas had soil which hardened well on its own while others did not. For example, the walls of Marrakesh up to 17% lime, while those of Fes and nearby Meknes contain up to 47%. The technique is still in use today, though the composition and ratio of these materials has continued to change over time as some materials (like clay) have become relatively more costly than others (like gravel). The walls were built from bottom to top one level at a time. Workers pressed and packed in the materials into sections ranging from 50 and 70 cm in length that were each held together temporarily by wooden boards. Once the material was settled, the wooden restraints could be removed and the process was repeated on top of the previously completed level. This process of initial wooden scaffolding often leaves traces in the form of multiple rows of little holes visible across the face of the walls. In many cases walls were covered with a coating of lime, stucco, or other material to give them a smooth surface and to better protect the main structure. This type of construction required consistent maintenance and upkeep, as the materials are relatively permeable and are more easily eroded by rain over time; in parts of Morocco, (especially near the Sahara) kasbahs and other structures made with a less durable composition (typically lacking lime) can begin to crumble apart in less than a couple of decades after they've been abandoned. As such, old structures of this type remain intact only insofar as they are continuously restored; some stretches of wall today appear brand new due to regular maintenance, while others are crumbling.  City Gates  345x345pxAside from those of the Kasbah, the city's main gates all date back to the Almoravid period when the city walls were first built, but most of them have undergone subsequent modifications in later periods. Many of the medieval gates had complex \\"bent entrances\\" designed for greater defensiveness. Nowadays, simple archways have been opened alongside many of them to allow for easier passage in and out of the medina, along with other gaps in the city walls created to accommodate new roads. = Gates of the medina = The following are the main historical gates of the medina (the main walled city; not counting the Kasbah to the south). The gates are described below in order, starting from the northeast corner of the medina and proceeding in a clockwise fashion.  Bab el-Khemis  This gate is located in the northern/northeastern corner of the city walls and dates back to the Almoravid period. It was originally known as Bab Fes (\\"Gate of Fes\\"), but this name was apparently lost during the Marinid era. The gate's current name (el-Khemis) refers to the souk or open-air market which historically took place here every Thursday (al-Khamis in Arabic). Nowadays, the market continues almost all week right outside the gate, while a permanent flea market, Souk al-Khemis, has been constructed a few hundred meters to the north. Also just outside the gate is a qubba (domed mausoleum) housing the tomb of a local marabout or Muslim saint. The gate's outer entrance is flanked on either side by square bastions. The gate's passage originally consisted of a bent entrance which effected a single 90-degree turn; one entered the gate from the north and then exited westwards into the city. According to legend, the door leaves of the gate were brought from Spain by a victorious Yusuf ibn Tashfin. During the Almohad period, the gatehouse was expanded such that its passage effected three more right-angle turns before exiting southwards. This gave it a similar form and layout to several other major Almohad gates such as Bab er-Rouah. The outline of the gate's original exit, now walled-up, can still be seen in its interior western wall. The gate underwent a significant renovation in 1803-04 on the orders of Sultan Moulay Slimane, noted by a marble inscription found inside. At some point in the 20th century, the inner wall of the passage was opened up to allow a straight passage directly through the gate in order to facilitate the heavy traffic in the area, resulting in the current form of the gate.

Its name means \\"Gate of the Tanners\\" and refers to the nearby tanneries which have been present here since the Almoravid period. It has the most complicated layout of any gate: its passage bends 5 times, in an almost S-like path, passing through two open-air courts and one covered chamber. A staircase in the southeastern corner of the structure grants access to the roof of the gate. Scholars believe, however, that only the central part of the gate (the vaulted chamber) dates back to the original Almoravid gate and that the Almohads added the inner and outer courtyard sections. The gate thus originally would have had a \\"simple\\" bent entrance (i.e. it turned 90-degrees only once). File:Bab Debbagh exterior.jpgThe outer (eastern) entrance of Bab Debbagh File:Bab debbagh DSCF1421.jpgThe first (eastern) inner courtyard of the gate and one of the inner doorways File:Bab Debbagh interior.jpgThe bending passage inside the gate File:Bab debbagh DSCF1418.jpgThe inner (western) entrance of Bab Debbagh (facing the city)  Bab Aylan  Bab Aylan is the other (southernmost) eastern gate of the city, south of Bab Debbagh. It is named after the Aylan tribe (pronounced Haylana in Arabic), which was part of the Berber Masmuda confederacy. The gate was the site of the Battle of al-Buhayra in 1130 in which the Almoravids defeated an assault by the Almohads. (The battle was named after a garden, Buhayrat al-Raka'ik, which was located here near the eastern gates of the city.) The original Almoravid gate had a simple bent passage (i.e. turning 90-degrees once) located within a bastion on the outer side of the ramparts. Some time after the Almoravid period another bent passage was added on the inner side of the gate, such that one enters the gate from the south, turns twice (first left, then right), and emerges into the city facing north.  Bab Aghmat  This gate was named after Aghmat, the early capital of the Almoravids before Marrakesh, which lay in this direction (i.e. to the south/southeast). The gate may have also been called Bab Yintan, though this is uncertain and this name may have referred to another nearby gate which has since disappeared. Like other Almoravid gates of the city, it has been significantly modified since its initial construction. Originally, it most likely consisted of a bent passage which effected a full 180-degree turn, forming a symmetrical structure around the axis of the wall: one entered from the west through a bastion on the outer side of the city wall, passing through a roofed vestibule, then exited westwards from the bastion on the inner side of the wall, passing through an open-air court. In a much later period a walled courtyard with a very different construction style was added on the outer end of the gate, forcing traffic to effect one more 180-degree turn (though in recent times the northern wall of this courtyard has been knocked down to allow a more direct passage). A staircase in the northeastern corner of the gatehouse leads to the roof. A major cemetery, the Bab Aghmat Cemetery, occupies a wide area just outside the gate.  Bab er-Robb (Bab Neffis)  alt= Bab er-Robb is one of the most unusual gates in the city, and the only one to be located in an angle or corner of the walls. While historians Deverdun and Allain believes the gate to be of Almohad origin (specifically under Ya'qub al-Mansur) due to its location relative to the Almohad Kasbah, historian Quentin Wilbaux more recently argued that its location in the wider schema of the city suggests it was an original Almoravid gate. All of them believe that Bab Neffis, another gate described in historical sources and named after the nearby Neffis (or N'fis) River, was most likely another name for the same gate. The word Robb or Rubb refers to a type of cooked wine whose vineyards were cultivated along the Neffis River and thus imported and regulated through this gate. A water basin measuring approximately 70 by 40 metres once existed outside this gate, in an area now covered by a cemetery, and was used for swimming practice. The main structure of the gate is a bastion inside which a bent passage enters from the north, performs a 180-degree turn, and then exits again to the north. Today, the walls in the area have been moved around the gate's bastion such that both entrances of the gate, facing north, open inside the city walls, obscuring its original role as an entrance to the city. However, when the gate was studied by French scholars in 1912 the surrounding city wall had a different configuration: rather than attaching to the side of the gatehouse it attached to the middle of the gate's northern facade, between its two doorways, such that the eastern doorway was outside the city wall while the western one was inside the walls. Since both entrances still faced north, this meant that the outer entrance was not actually directly visible to outsiders coming from the countryside because it faced back towards the city walls; as a result, travelers arriving from the south had to walk all the way around to the far side of the bastion and enter it from the north. Because of this uncharacteristic configuration, and based on comparisons with other gates of the city, Wilbaux has hypothesized that the city's ramparts in this area were previously altered and moved around the gate such that the entrances were originally reversed: the eastern doorway, which was the outer entrance in 1912, was originally located inside the city walls, while the western doorway (the inner entrance in 1912) was originally outside the city walls. This way, the bastion of the gate straddled the city wall and its design was thus quite similar to the original configuration of Bab Aghmat, the other southern gate of the city.  Bab al-Makhzen  Bab el-Makhzen Bab al-Makhzen is one of the western gates of the city, located west of the Kutubiyya Mosque. It dates back to the Almoravid period.It was probably named after the palace (Dar al-Makhzen) which existed near here in the Almoravid period as part of the former Ksar el-Hajjar. The gate is flanked by octagonal towers and has been much modified. It originally had a simple bent passage (turning 90 degrees to the north) but the gatehouse has since disappeared and only a simple arched opening remains today. At the beginning of the 20th century the gate was walled-up and closed, but today a road passes through it.  Bab al-'Arisa (Bab ar-Raha)  Bab el-'Arissa Bab al-'Arisa (meaning \\"Gate of the Bride\\"; also spelled as Bab Larissa or Bab Lrissa) is also known as Bab al-'Arais (\\"Gate of the Fianc√©s\\") and formerly as Bab ar-Raha (Raha possibly meaning \\"abundance\\" or \\"well-being\\"; it is also a surname in Marrakesh). It is the other western gate of the city, located north of Bab el- Makhzen in an angle of the ramparts, and dates back to the Almoravid period. Like Bab al-Makhzen to the south, the gate is flanked by octagonal towers and originally had a simple bent passage (turning 90 degrees to the north), but has since been modified. It was walled-up at the beginning of the 20th century but today it has a simple opening through which a local road passes.  Bab Doukkala  Floor plan of Bab Doukkala Bab Doukkala is the northwestern gate of the medina. Its name, Doukkala, was that of both a Berber tribe and of a region between Marrakesh and Casablanca today. The gate is also of Almoravid construction, but unlike many others it has not been subject to major modifications (at least in its floor plan) and retains its original sophisticated bent entrance design. The passage inside the gate bends at a straight angle twice: one enters from the west, turns south, then turns east before emerging into the city. Today the gate is flanked by other simple openings in the wall to allow for easy circulation. File:Moorish gates (49907885093).jpgThe outer (western) facade of Bab Doukkala File:Bab Doukkala exterior.jpgThe inner (eastern) facade of Bab Doukkala  Other minor gates of the medina  A few other gates, mainly from recent centuries, can be found around the city and have their own names, in addition to a number of non-notable openings in the walls which have been created to improve free movement in and out of the medina. These include: *Bab Nkob: Bab Nkob is a recent gate created during the French Protectorate period (1912-1956) to connect the old medina with the new city districts created by the French known as Gueliz. Today it is simply a gap in the walls through which a major road passes. *Bab Jdid: Bab Jdid (\\"New Gate\\") is another recent gate to the west of the Kutubiyya Mosque and near the Mamounia hotel and gardens. A modern road passes through it. *Bab Qchich: Bab Qchich (also spelled Bab Kechich, or Kechiche) is a recent gate located between Bab el- Khemis and Bab ad-Debbagh, at the northeastern tip of the old medina. A modern road passes through this modest archway named after the former landlord of the nearby garden.

They are listed here.  Bab Taghzout  alt= Dating to the Almoravid period, this was originally the northern gate of the city until Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah extended the city walls to encompass the northern neighbourhood of Sidi Bel Abbes in the 18th century. The gate's name, Taghzout, is of unclear historical origin but is a common Berber toponym with a few different meanings; it may have referred to a nearby village or to the valley of the Tensift River. The gate is also called Bab Sidi Bel Abbes (after the nearby shrine). The gate resembled the nearby Bab el-Khemis in its original configuration: it was flanked by two square bastions and had a bent entrance by which one entered from the north and exited to the west. Today, however, the gate has lost its bastions and its bent passage and all that remains is a large archway over the main street to the south of the Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes.  Bab Moussoufa  Bab Moussoufa (or Bab Massufa) is an Almoravid gate whose history is uncertain but whose location is hypothesized to have been in the northwest corner of the city, north of Bab Doukkala and west of Bab Taghzout, near the neighbourhood of Riyad al-'Arus. Its name comes from an Almoravid Berber tribe.  Bab ash-Shari'a  Sidi al-Suhayli, at the former location of Bab ash-Shari'a. Some remains of the gate's archway are visible on the right side of the building. Bab ash- Shari'a, meaning the \\"Gate of Justice/Law\\" (Shari'a), was the main southwestern gate of the city, dating back to the Almoravid period. It was located near an angle of the walls just west of Bab er-Robb. The gate was rebuilt in the Almohad period when Abu Ya'qub Yusuf ordered his son, Ya'qub (the future al-Mansur), to move this section of the wall further south to accommodate a new neighbourhood for the city's growing population. This work was carried out over August and September of 1183 and a new Bab ash-Shari'a gate was inaugurated by Abu Ya'qub Yusuf. The location of this gate has since been blocked and occupied by the mausoleum of Imam as-Suhayli (one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh), though remains of the gate can be seen next to the mausoleum. A large open-air prayer area, called a musalla or msalla, was located just outside the gate during the Almoravid and Almohad era (though it may have been moved during the construction of the Kasbah). Also near here was a hippodrome for equestrian games and training, equipped with a pavilion from which the amir or caliph could observe the activities. Today this area is occupied by a large cemetery stretching out from Bab er-Robb.  Bab as- Saliha  This was one of the southern gates of the Almoravid city, named after the Saliha gardens south of the city. It was located where the Almohad Kasbah district was later created; which is when the gate likely disappeared.  Bab Yintan  Scholars are uncertain about the identity and location of this gate. It may have been a southern gate of the city, possibly near what later became the Jewish Mellah on the east side of the Kasbah, but it has since disappeared without any clear trace. Another possibility is that it was simply another name for Bab Aylan or, more likely, Bab Aghmat. French historian Gaston Deverdun, in particular, favoured this second hypothesis. = Gates of the Kasbah = 250x250px Bab Ksiba Badi Palacealt= The earliest gates of the Kasbah date to the Almohad period, but a number of gates date from the various expansions of the kasbah and the royal palace (Dar al- Makhzen) in later centuries.  Bab Agnaou  Bab Agnaou, one of Marrakesh's most famous and beautiful gates, was the main public and ceremonial entrance to the Kasbah of the city. The name agnaou is believed to be of Berber origin and had multiple historically reported meanings including \\"mutes\\" and, later on, \\"Black people\\" (or the Gnawa); however, it's unclear what exact connotation the name had in this case. The gate was also called Bab al-Qasr (\\"Gate of the Palace\\") and Bab al-Kuhl (\\"Gate of Kohl\\"). Its construction is attributed to Ya'qub al-Mansur (the founder of the Kasbah) in 1188. It is located just inside the walls of the medina, near Bab er-Robb. The gate was originally flanked by two bastion towers and the passage inside was a bent entrance (meaning it turned 90 degrees before exiting) passing through a large vaulted vestibule. On top of the gate was a terrace reached by an interior staircase. This layout made it similar to other monumental Almohad gates such as Bab er-Rouah in Rabat. The flanking towers and the covered vestibule, however, have since disappeared, and the archway of the gate has been partly filled-in with a smaller brick arch. Nonetheless, the gate has preserved its rich stone-carved decoration from the Almohad period, again comparable to that of Bab er-Rouah and of Bab Oudaia in Rabat.  Bab Ksiba  Bab Ksiba (or Bab Qusayba) is a small western gate to the Kasbah district. It used to be the entrance to another small kasbah (qusayba) which was adjoined to the main kasbah in this area to protect the western side of the Grand Mechouar (a vast open square, still present today, at the entrance of the royal palace) and the Derb Chtouka neighbourhood. The date of its construction is unclear; it existed at the beginning of the 19th century and may have been built under Muhammad ibn Abdallah in the 18th century, but was almost certainly not part of the original Almohad kasbah.  Bab Berrima  Bab Berrima (also spelled Bab Barrima) was a gate between the main city (the medina) and the northeast part of the Royal Kasbah. It existed in the Saadian period and may have been used by workers coming in and out during construction of the Badi Palace.  Bab Shkiru  This minor gate is located at the northeastern corner of the current Royal Palace. It was built on the orders of Sultan Moulay Hassan (ruled 1873‚Äì1894) in order to facilitate access to the palace at this end. It is named after the qadi who was in charge of its construction.  Gates of the southern Kasbah and the mechouars of the Royal Palace  Under Muhammad ibn Abdallah (governor of Marrakesh after 1746, sultan 1757-1790), the Royal Palace (Dar al-Makhzen) in the Kasbah was renovated and expanded. This expansion mainly progressed southwards, where the sultan built a number of mechouars (official squares at the entrance to the Royal Palace where royal ceremonies and receptions could take place). These occupied a large space between the palace to the north and the Agdal Gardens to the south. The mechouars were accessed through a number of gates with their own unique names; although many of the gates are of minor historical or architectural interest. Roughly from east to west, these gates were: *Bab Ahmar: Bab Ahmar (\\"Red Gate\\"; also spelled Bab Hmar) is the eastern entrance into the southern kasbah districts and mechouars. It is located at the southern corner of the Bab Aghmat Cemetery. The gate dates to the reign of Muhammad ibn Abdallah and may have been the work of Ahmad al-Inglisi, who was responsible for building and restoring a variety of monuments across Morocco around this time. The gate was also used as a large guardhouse with a terrace that could hold light artillery. The neighbourhood near the gate was inhabited mainly by Black African servants and soldiers working for the Royal Palace. *Bab al-Furma: This gate stands between the Bab Ahmar district to the east and the Outer Mechouar (also called Mechouar al-Barrani) to the west. Its name means \\"Gate of the Breach\\". *Bab al-Harri: This gate is the passage between the Outer Mechouar and the Barrima neighbourhood to the north. Its name means \\"Gate of the Silos(/Granaries)\\". *Bab al-Riyal: This gate led from the Outer Mechouar to the palace of the viceroy. The origin of its name is unclear. *Bab er-Rih: This gate led from the Outer Mechouar to the Inner Mechouar (also called Mechouar al-Wastani) to the west. Its name means \\"Gate of the Wind\\", though the origin of this is unclear. On the other side of the mechouar, opposite this gate, is another monumental gate (unnamed) over which a passage along the top of the wall allowed for direct and discrete passage between the palace and the Agdal Gardens to the south. Beyond this gate and wall was the vast Grand Mechouar. After its construction, the gate was repaired again by Sultan Moulay Hassan between 1873 and 1894. *Bab al-Akhdar: Meaning the \\"Green Gate\\", this was the main entrance of the Royal Palace at the middle of the northern side of the Inner Mechouar. (The northern part of the palace was also known as al-Qasr al-Akhdar or \\"the Green Palace\\".) *Bab Bu 'Uqqaz: Named after a qadi in charge of constructions in the palace, this is the main entrance of the Royal Palace from the Grand Mechouar (west of the Inner Mechouar), where ambassadors were received. It is located in the northeastern corner of this mechouar. *Bab Ighli: West of the Grand Mechouar, at the end of a main street between two walls, is a gate known as Bab Ighli (also spelled Bab Irhli), named after the mason who built the original gate. South of the gate is the Cemetery of Sidi A'mara. Another gate (of uncertain name) at the eastern end of the same street, on the edge of the Grand Mechouar itself, is notable for the distinctive tower on its north side. The tower, topped by a pyramidal green-tiled roof and featuring a small wooden balcony, is actually the minaret of the former Mosque of Derb Chtouka (named after a street in the adjoining neighbourhood), an 18th-century mosque (also by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah) which has since disappeared.

File:Street - panoramio (99).jpgBab Ighli Street, looking west towards Bab Ighli gate (visible in the distance)  Former gates of the Almohad Kasbah  A number of gates existed in the original Almohad kasbah which have disappeared today but are known from historical sources. In particular, the kasbah had a number of inner gates which granted passage between its three main districts, as well as few outer gates aside from Bab Agnaou. They included: * Bab as-Sadat: While Bab Agnaou was the main public entrance to the Kasbah for the common people, the high officials and royal family members of the Almohad regime used to enter via a gate known as Bab as-Sadat (roughly meaning \\"Gate of the Lords/Nobles\\"). It was located in the outer western wall of the Kasbah, allowing them to enter the Kasbah directly without having to pass through the city. Inside, the gate led to the main square (the Asaraq) in the central western district of the kasbah, which in turn granted access to the caliph's palaces. Outside the walls, near this gate, was an important cemetery. *Bab as-Saqa'if: Meaning \\"Gate of the Porticoes\\", this gate was located along the main street connecting the main square (the Asaraq) in the central western part of the kasbah to another main square in front of the Kasbah Mosque to the north. The entire length of the street was lined with porticoes or galleries, hence the gate's name. The gate was the main northern entrance to the Asaraq from the north, and it also stood not far from Bab as-Sadat. *Bab at-Tubul: Meaning \\"Gate of the Drums\\", this gate was located at the northern end of the porticoed street which ran from Bab as-Saqa'if and granted access to the square in front of the Kasbah Mosque. The gate, in one form or another, was still present in the 16th century. * Bab ar-Riyad: Meaning \\"Gate of the Riad\\" (referring to a palace with an interior garden), this was the personal entrance of the caliph to his palace. *Bab al-Ghadr: Meaning the \\"Gate of Betrayal\\", this gate is partly a mystery. It is referenced in historical sources, including an anecdote in which the Almohad caliph al-Murtada was forced to knock down the gate while attempting to flee the city in 1266-67. It may have been a postern gate on the south side of the kasbah. * Bab al- Qarraqin: Meaning (approximately) \\"Gate of the Cobblers\\", this was essentially a service gate for the kasbah, located on its northern side and allowing access to the main city in order to procure further supplies. The gate was likely modest in character. * Bab al-Bustan: Meaning \\"Gate of the Garden\\", this gate was located at the southern end of the palace district and allowed passage between the palace and the Agdal Gardens to the south of the Kasbah. French historian Deverdun believed the gate may have been at the same location as the main entrance of the current royal palace, which is aligned with the gardens.

They used three different radial engines, more than doubling the Sport's power over two years of development. 34 examples were built and frequently re-engined. Design and development S-300 Sport S-300 Sport Before joining Inland Aviation Co., founded in 1928, Dewey Bonbrake had designed and built his Bonbrake Parasol, based on the Bahl Lark. Almost all of his designs for Inland were variations on the former. These were span, parasol wing monoplanes with side-by-side open cockpit seating for two, designed to be powered by a range of five or seven cylinder radial engines. The wing was a two spar structure, rectangular in plan out to rounded tips. The spars were wooden (spruce) but the ribs metal (duralumin). Chrome-molybdenum steel, N-form struts from the spars attached the wing to the lower fuselage, assisted centrally by a short cabane. Chrome-molybdenum steel was used structurally throughout the rest of the airframe, including the differential ailerons. The engine was nose-mounted was mounted with its cylinders exposed for cooling. The first prototype, the S-100, was powered by a five cylinder, Velie M-5. As more powerful and heavier engines were used in later variants the nose length decreased to maintain trim. Behind the engine the Sport's fuselage was based on a welded structure and was flat-sided with rounded decking. Its open, side- by-side cockpit was under the wing, limiting the upward view but improving tutor to pupil communication, with a large luggage compartment behind it. Its tail was conventional with a straight-edged, rounded-tipped tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage structure and braced to the lower longerons, which carried elevators of similar plan apart from cut-outs for rudder movement. Its pilot could trim the Sport in flight by adjusting the tailplane angle of incidence. The vertical tail was also rectangular in profile out to a rounded top. The rudder reached to the keel, where a short tailskid attached to it assisted ground manoeuvrability. The Sport's main undercarriage was fixed and of wide track, with the wheels on separate axles mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, as were the drag struts. Legs, including oleo struts, were mounted on the forward wing struts at points reinforced by short struts to the upper and lower longerons. Operational history Between 1928 and 1930 six Sport models appeared, differing chiefly in their engine power which ranged from delivered by three different engine types, each with their own variants. In all 34 were built and at least nine had at least two different engines during their lives. The most powerful Sport variant, the sole W-600 Super Sport fitted with a Warner Scarab, was destroyed during a test flight. Inland Aircraft were declared bankrupt in 1932.

Production The design was built by Bayfield Boat Yard in Clinton, Ontario, Canada, starting in 1984, but the company went out of business in 1988 after a factory fire and production ended. Design The Bayfield 36 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass, with teak wood trim. It has a cutter rig, with anodized aluminum spars, a clipper bow with a bowsprit and trailboards, a raised counter transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of encapsulated lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.

The design has sleeping accommodation for seven people, with double berths in the bow and aft private cabins and settee berths for three in the main cabin with an \\"L\\" shaped dinette table. The galley is located on the starboard side and is equipped with a two-burner alcohol-fired stove, an electric refrigerator and a deep stainless steel sink with hot and cold pressure fresh water and a sea water pump. A navigation station is provided. The head includes a shower. The cabin sole is teak and holly. Below deck headroom is . Ventilation is provided by an opening hatch over the galley, opening ports and a butterfly skylight in the main salon. The forward stateroom has two opening hatches and one opening port. The aft stateroom has one opening port and one opening hatch. All ports and hatches have insect screens. For sailing, the design is equipped with four Lewmar #40 primary winches, two Lewmar #16 mainsheet winches, three #16 halyard winches and a single #8 Lewmar reefing winch. Operational history Sven Donaldson reviewed the Bayfield 36 in 1987 for Canadian Yachting, noting \\"the aesthetics of a beautiful boat could be argued endlessly, but in the final analysis some folks will always love the Bayfield look while other won't. It's easy to argue that the Bayfield 36 is a robust, up-to-date cruising boat that is capable of giving good service to a couple and their guests or a small family. As the average sailboat gets to look more and more like a space probe, it's refreshing to have a few builders around who choose to buck the tide. For some like Bayfield, variety is not only the spice of life, but a sound business principle.\\" Marine Surveyor Richard Jordan reviewed the Bayfield 36 in 2009, writing, \\"certain styles never go away. There is always the lure of the pirate ships of old with their trailboards, bowsprits, and clipper bows. And at every sailor‚Äôs essence are certain pirate ideas, the romance of adventures on the high seas. The look speaks of journeys to far off lands for exciting adventures ... These 36-footers have an excellent reputation in Canada, more well known than here in the USA. Her interior is arguably the largest you will find on a 36-foot sailboat. The roomy accommodations combined with her offshore sailing pedigree make her one of the best choices around in this range for a serious offshore yacht.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *C&C; 36-1 *C&C; 36R *Catalina 36 *Columbia 36 *Coronado 35 *CS 36 *Ericson 36 *Frigate 36 *Hinterhoeller F3 *Hunter 36 *Invader 36 *Nonsuch 36 *Portman 36 *Seidelmann 37 *Vancouver 36 (Harris) *Watkins 36 *Watkins 36C References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Bayfield 36"},{"id":"64079215","text":"Dark Planet may refer to: * Dark Planet (novel), a 2007 novel based the television series Doctor Who * Dark Planet (film), a 2008 Russian science fiction film See also * Carbon planet, a theoretical type of planet that contains more carbon than oxygen ","title":"Dark Planet"},{"id":"64079218","text":"The 1989 Bucknell Bison football team represented Bucknell University as a member of the Colonial League in the 1989 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

It was founded in 1976 on the initiative of the Danish secret service and has operated largely undetected since then. The most important tool for reconnaissance and decryption was the sale of encryption devices with weak encryption methods. This was done via Crypto AG, a supposedly private Swiss company secretly owned by the BND and the CIA. History The motives for the alliance were twofold: cooperation on signals intelligence via satellites and cooperation on technical interception challenges and exchange methods. The alliance was founded in 1976 by Danish intelligence and initially only consisted of Denmark, Sweden and West Germany. The Dutch government was invited to join in 1977 and joined in 1978. The name was chosen in 1979 and was taken from a Munich-brewed beer. France requested to join in 1983 and with strong support from West Germany joined in 1984. Other countries have asked to join, but these requests have been turned down. Bart Jacobs claims that these include Norway, Spain and Italy.  Activities  So far, only some activities by the Dutch arm, (TIVC), are publicly known, mostly providing administrative assistance to the GCHQ, a British organization, during the Falklands War in decoding of Argentine radio traffic. At the urging of the CIA, the sale of compromised encryption devices from the Dutch company Philips to Turkey was enforced against the will of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), Germany's foreign intelligence agency, and the TIVC. The service maintained a ground station in the Caribbean on Cura√ßao, which monitored and decoded the radio traffic from Cuba and Venezuela.

Kemper Snowboards quickly rose in popularity in snowboarding brands in the industry.https://www.snewsnet.com/gear/kemper-snowboards-relaunches The Kemper brand was best remembered for fully embracing snowboarding‚Äôs neon period in both their snowboard graphics and their incredible range of funky outerwear.https://www.mensjournal.com/gear/snowboarding-gear-defined-last- decade/ David Kemper eventually partnered with a windsurfing distribution company in Glendale, California called the Romney Group who added Kemper Snowboards to their portfolio of brands. During that time, David relocated to California to help oversee the business, team management, and the growing product line. In 1992, David sold his remaining shares of the company to focus on his college education. By 1994 the company was sold to an in-line skate company on the east coast. A couple of years shortly after, Kemper Snowboards officially went out of business.https://highlandermag.usu.edu/kemper- snowboards-returns-on-a-nostalgia-wave/ In the winter of 2018, Jib Hunt, a former professional snowboarder, relaunched the Kemper Snowboards brandhttps://www.saltlakemagazine.com/kemper-snowboards-park- city/?fbclid=IwAR03QE7_g7gXanH72s2CL-y5CqB8nCGr1ar4Yn6rv28067iX6P_0C1k7lso. In the summer of 2019, Hunt moved Kemper‚Äôs headquarters from the east coast to Park City, Utah to better position the snowboarding brand for growth and exposure within the Utah snowboarding scene.

Vote leave director Dominic Cummings have claimed it was crucial to the success of that campaign while others have claimed other systems were also crucial. A version has been provisioned as available as open source download. Etymology The acronym VICS as well as standing for Voter Intention Collection System was also the nickname of Victoria Woodcock, operations director of Vote Leave who project managed the creation of the system. History BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has commented an insider in the Vote Leave Campaign had told her they were looking at ways to \\"find a way of mashing the mountain of data that we generate in daily life online with more normal ways of measuring political support\\". Tom Waterhouse, deputy head of the ground campaign for vote leave, said Stein Fletcher built the VICS system. The location of a GitHub open source repository under an MIT license that could build the VICS system was made known by Cummings in a blog post in October 2016. TechnicalOperation= Waterhouse described the way VICS worked for the ground campaign can be summarised as follows: VICS would be loaded with a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù, a predictive algorithm used to predict the percentage of Eurosceptic voters at the level of individual streets when combined with statistics from the 2014 general and European elections. With minimal cross checking the prediction from doorstep canvassing activists were able to target specific addresses where there was likely to be a leave voter on polling day. =Components= The user interface for the client was developed as a Single-page application using AngularJS.

Significance debate There are claims the intelligence VICS enabled the Vote leave campaign to cost-effectively deliver over one billion targeted advertisements over social media with most via Facebook. Others claims VICS was not as capable or effective as it was claimed to be, with some of Cummings' claimed functionality already available on the Facebook.

This the following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. December 2019 On December 31, 2019 the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in China, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified. January 2020 January 1, 2020 the WHO set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across all three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak. On January 7, 2020, when it appeared that there was a health crisis emerging in Wuhan, Dr. Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, was quoted advising Canadians: \\"There has been no evidence to date that this illness, whatever it's caused by, is spread easily from person to person; no health care workers caring for the patients have become ill; a positive sign. January 13 a person in Thailand is the first patient outside of China is confirmed to have COVID. On January 17, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) indicated plans were in progress \\"to implement signage\\" in the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver airports to raise awareness of the virus, and that there would be an additional health screening question added to the electronic kiosks for passengers arriving from central China. The agency noted the overall risk to Canadians was low and there were no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. The CBSA said it would not be, at that time, implementing extra screening measures, but would \\"monitor the situation closely\\". On January 23, the federal Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, said that five or six people were being monitored for signs of the virus. That same day, Dr. Theresa Tam was a member of the WHO committee that broadcast that it was too early to declare a public health emergency of international concern. The following day in Wuhan China construction began on a new hospital to treat COVID patients that would take only 10 days to build and was widely reported around the world. On January 25, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22. Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei. Federal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low. On January 26, Tam stated \\"There is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person. The risk to Canadians remains low.\\" Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on January 27. On January 27, Canada confirmed its first case. On January 29, Dr. Theresa Tam told Canadians that \\"It's going to be rare (COVID-19), but we are expecting cases.\\" On January 29, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne announced that an aircraft would be sent to repatriate Canadians from the areas affected by the virus in China. On January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus was a \\"public health emergency of international concern\\". February 2020 On February 1, the government's position remained that it would be discriminatory to exclude travellers from China, the politico- geographical source of the disease. On February 2, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that it planned to charter a plane to assist in the evacuation of Canadian nationals still in Wuhan once given authorization by China, intending to fly them to CFB Trenton for repatriation and medical screenings. Only those that had entered the country with a Canadian passport would be allowed to take this flight. The first plane landed at CFB Trenton on February 7. On February 21, a chartered flight of 131 Canadians who were quarantined aboard after an outbreak on the cruise ship in Japan, and who all tested negative for the virus, were brought to CFB Trenton for additional screening before being transported by bus to the NAV Centre in Cornwall, Ontario to be quarantined. On February 3, at a time when the US and Australia had excluded foreigners who travelled from China, Hajdu denounced \\"the spread of misinformation and fear across Canadian society\\" and called on the opposition to \\"not sensationalize the risk to Canadians\\", while Tam endorsed the position by the World Health Organization, which \\"advises against any kind of travel and trade restrictions, saying that they are inappropriate and could actually cause more harm than good in terms of our global effort to contain\\" the disease. On February 21, University of Regina psychology professor Gordon J. G. Asmundson and University of British Columbia psychiatry professor Steven Taylor coined the neologism coronaphobia in an editorial from the august Journal of Anxiety Disorders, and attempted to link this phobia to xenophobia and bad discrimination. On February 26, Hajdu recommended that citizens stockpile food and medication, noting that it was \\"good to be prepared because things can change quickly [in any emergency].\\" The recommendation faced criticism from politicians: Manitoba health minister Cameron Friesen and Ontario health minister Christine Elliott both felt that there was no need for such aggressive stockpiling, while Friesen also felt that there needed to be more coordination between the federal and provincial levels in terms of information regarding the outbreak. Conservative Party shadow minister Matt Jeneroux opined that the suggestion incited concern and was lacking in transparency. Health Canada's website recommended against such bulk purchases (as to not strain supply chains), and explained that having supplies on hand was to \\"ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.\\" March 2020 A highway sign on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto discouraging non-essential travel Regina supermarket as a result of panic buying On March 4, 2020, Trudeau announced his creation of the Cabinet Committee on the federal response to the coronavirus disease, chaired by Chrystia Freeland, \\"to limit the spread of the virus\\" and to protect \\"the health and safety of all Canadians\\". Hajdu announced on March 6 that the federal government would offer $27 million in funding to 47 research groups at 19 universities to develop means of managing the outbreak. Minister of Finance Bill Morneau stated that the next federal budget would include measures in response to the outbreak, including an increase to the risk adjustment provision. On March 8, Champagne stated that at the request of the U.S. government, Canada had chartered a EuroAtlantic passenger airplane to evacuate the 237 citizens that were still aboard the cruise ship . They were quarantined at CFB Trenton for two weeks when the plane landed on March 10. Member of Parliament Anthony Housefather announced on March 9 that he was undergoing self-isolation as a precautionary measure due to possible contact with a person at an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in Washington. The next day, Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O'Regan stated that he was also in self-isolation while awaiting the results of a coronavirus test. He had seen a doctor regarding a \\"persistent\\" head cold, who recommended testing, but was \\"not aware of contacting anyone infected\\". The test came back negative. On March 11, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1 billion response fund, including $500 million to go to provinces and territories, a $50 million contribution to the World Health Organization and an additional $275 million to fund COVID-19 research in Canada. Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages M√©lanie Joly stated that she had been discussing means of mitigating the outbreak's impact on the air travel industry. Also on March 11, the WHO declared the existence of a global pandemic. On March 12, after returning from a speaking engagement in London, England, Trudeau's wife Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19. She and the Prime Minister went into self-isolation. The staff member is now thought to be Canada's first case of community transmission. On March 13, Trudeau announced that the federal government was preparing a stimulus package to address those affected by the pandemic. Also on March 13, Parliament agreed unanimously to shut its doors for five weeks (pursuant to Standing Order 28) because of COVID-19. On March 16, Trudeau announced that new entry restrictions would be implemented shortly after midnight ET on March 18, restricting entry into the country to Canadian citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families. The United States was excepted from this policy but on March 18 travellers from the United States were also banned in a mutual agreement with the US government (with exceptions in place for family members, for essential employees who commute across the border and for to ensure continued exchange of goods). Most international flights were routed to Canada's an arbitrary selection of four airports (YVR, YYC, YYZ, and YUL) in order \\"to enhance screening measures\\". Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne also announced that for citizens who are still abroad, the country would provide emergency loans of up to $5,000 to cover travel costs or basic needs until they are able to return. On March 24, 35 members of parliament met in order to discuss Bill C-13, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act. To maintain social distancing in the face of the highly contagious respiratory illness, only 35 of the 338 members of the House of Commons convened to debate the legislation. The Commons agreed \\"to see the application of Standing Order 17 (sic) suspended for the current sitting to allow (its) members the practice of social distancing.\\" Meanwhile, Dr. Theresa Tam was quoted as saying regarding Canadians' need to wear face masks: \\"most people haven't learned how to use masks\\" and \\"there is no need to use a mask for well people.\\" On March 28, Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau announced her full recovery and thanked her well-wishers via social media. The unemployment figures for the month of March were that the economy had shed 1,000,000 jobs, pushing the official jobless rate to 7.8 percent. April 2020 Vancouver, British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic on April 19. On April 2, Trudeau said that he foresaw the expiry of the COVID-19 crisis to occur only in July. On April 6, Trudeau introduced extra aid for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), saying \\"there are groups of people who aren't benefiting from [it] who probably should.\\" Also on April 6, the CPHO of Canada advised the use of a \\"non-medical face mask when shopping or using public transit\\" because \\"A non-medical mask can reduce the chance of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with others or land[ing] on surfaces\\". Tam offered advice on how to use \\"a cotton shirt combined with rubber bands\\" to create a DIY non-medical face mask. On April 9, the federal government released modelling that, even with strong public health measures, showed between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, with that number being closer to 300,000 deaths if no measures had been taken. Trudeau warned that \\"normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine for this\\", and that residents would \\"have to remain vigilant for at least a year.\\" The same day, Trudeau sent a letter to the provincial and territorial premiers to consult about invoking the Emergencies Act. While consultation with the provinces is a required step before the Act can be triggered, the Prime Minister's Office said there was no present plan to enact it and that doing so remained a last resort. On a conference call between Trudeau and the premiers later that day, the premiers communicated their unanimous opposition to invoking the Act. On April 10, the RCMP disclosed it has been asked to enforce the Quarantine Act, 2005. Penalties for violations can include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months. One reporter said that the RCMP \\"could enter homes to enforce Quarantine Act orders if Canadians don't self-isolate... [and] will do physical checks to enforce it.\\" It was reported that the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command Medical Intelligence Cell (MEDINT) has submitted reports on the outbreak in Wuhan since January 2020. On April 11, Parliament re-convened to pass Bill C-14: COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, No. 2, and thereby adopt the CEWS. As with the previous siting on March 24, 35 MPs stood in for the full complement of 338 members due to the need for COVID-19 social distancing. Government briefing notes detailed \\"a bureaucracy reluctant to put inbound China passengers in mandatory quarantine or close borders to arrivals from other (COVID-19) hotspots.\\" Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet supported Trudeau when he \\"raised health and safety concerns over holding regular meetings (in order) to respect physical distancing\\". All that was needed to debate and to pass the bill to spend $73 billion were five hours. On April 15, Trudeau warned against premature reopening of the economy, stating that \\"in order to get to that point, we need to continue doing what we are doing now for many more weeks\\". Anti-lockdown protest in Vancouver on April 26. On April 20, Parliament's temporary suspension for five weeks expiredSee note dated March 13, above and it voted, over the objections of Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party of Canada, by a 22-15 margin to sit only once weekly on Wednesdays for as long as Trudeau can convince the nation that the coronavirus poses a grave health and safety risk. On April 28, it was revealed that \\"79 per cent of all deaths in the country\\" were to that date connected with \\"long- term care and seniors' homes.\\" On April 30, the Parliamentary Budget Officer warned that the Federal deficit for fiscal year 2020 could be in excess of $252 billion, as Canadians of every stripe rushed for the lifeboats. Robyn Urback issued from her column in The Globe and Mail a blistering attack on Trudeau's Cabinet, entitled \\"Canadians have been gaslit on China\\". Also on April 30, the City of Ottawa allowed the Muslims an exemption on the noise bylaw that allowed them to use modern loudspeaker technology to amplify a five-minute recording of their call to worship because of the blanket ban on freedom of assembly during the coronavirus crisis. This followed similar exemptions in Toronto and Mississauga.  May 2020  alt= On May 1, 2020, royal assent was granted to Bill C-15, to implement the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), after a cursory one-day consideration by 35 MPs. It established a subsidy programme for secondary school graduates and post- secondary students. Students who cannot find employment or are unable to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic are eligible for CA$1,250 per month from May through August 2020. On May 1, it came to light that Shanker Nesathurai, Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) for Haldimand County and Norfolk County both of which lie on the shores of Lake Erie, had issued an order under the provincial Health Protection and Promotion Act which reads: Norfolk County Council was told that in order to remove the CMOH would require a two-thirds vote from Council along with approval from the provincial government. On May 4, Trudeau discouraged Canadians from displaying complacency due to the lifting of economic restrictions by provinces, emphasizing that it was \\"extremely important\\" for citizens to continue practicing social distancing and personal hygiene to prevent the spread, and not go out \\"unless you absolutely have to\\". He explained that although the country was on a \\"positive trajectory\\", \\"we are not out of the woods, however, and it requires us to continue to remain attentive and vigilant and following the instructions set out by our public health officials.\\" On May 5, it came to light that the mayor of Huron-Kinloss township by Lake Huron in March 2020 ordered water service to seasonal properties shut off. Carling Township ordered its boat launch facility to remain closed, thus preventing access to anyone who needs it, including seasonal residents. Cottage-country mayors pleaded with the government of Ontario to legislate or somehow else to accept responsibility for their fate. In a memo circulated to his subordinate medical officers of health, Dr. David Williams was frightened by the advice of CMOH Nesathurai and said that Premier Doug Ford weighed in and said that he would not take responsibility: Also on May 5, the Canadian red meat industry was granted access to federal COVID emergency subsidies. On May 6, columnist Rex Murphy voiced criticism of what he called the \\"Liberal Government at the Bottom of the Cottage Doorsteps\\" (LGBCD). The LGBCD bestowed $850 million to an \\"international fund to research COVID-19.\\" He questioned why this sum and not another, and pointed out that \\"Canada has top scientists and physicians itself\\". Murphy described this new form of government, in which such questions are avoided, as It came to light on May 8 that 60 percent of COVID-19 fatalities were in Quebec, which has around 20 percent of the nation's population. Montreal was called \\"the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada.\\" Also on May 8 the Quebec government was unhappy with the federal CESB programme, because the $1,250-per-month-per-capita subsidy would hinder the ability of the province to attract student labour to the province's farms, in the absence of foreign agricultural workers who cannot travel to Quebec because the international frontiers have been closed by the federal government. On May 11, Trudeau, Morneau and Bains in a press conference said that \\"a bridge financing facility for large employers that need help to get through the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus.\\" One stated goal was \\"to avoid bankruptcies of otherwise viable firms wherever possible... Companies that use the lending facility will have to commit to respect collective bargaining agreements, protecting workers‚Äô pensions, and support national climate goals. Rules on access to the money will place limits on dividends, share buy-backs and executive pay.\\" The Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) will only target companies with annual revenues in excess of $300 million. It came to light on May 11 that problems at an oil sands plant in Kearl Lake, Alberta caused more than 100 COVID-19 illnesses across four provinces. Kearl Lake has more than 1,400 workers. The oil sands sector was declared an essential service by the Alberta government so that fly-in fly-out camps like Kearl Lake have continued to operate during the pandemic. Workers come from afar, typically for two week non-stop shifts. On April 15, Alberta Health Services declared an outbreak with three cases of the illness. On April 16, there were 12 cases. On May 8, the number of cases exceeded 100, including 23 located in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia because the shift work allows interprovincial commuters to thrive. \\"At least three went back to the community of La Loche in Saskatchewan's remote north. More than 130 people have since been infected with the contagion in the Dene village of 2,800 people, about 600 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. Two have died.\\" Two-week self-isolation policies were erected on April 19 by the away provinces. On May 12, Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) Yves Giroux raised the possibility that the federal debt \\"will hit $1 trillion because of pandemic relief spending.\\" Giroux said it was possible that pandemic programs could cost \\"more than what the entire federal government spent last year on everything\\", roughly $338 billion. Also on May 12, it was announced by Minister of International Development Karina Gould that $600 million would be contributed by the taxpayer to GAVI, \\"a vaccine alliance that improves vaccine access for vulnerable children around the world.\\" Also on May 12, Health Canada issued a press release with the announcement that the CCITF serological test would be administered to one million Canadians over the next two years. The government has selected DiaSorin to manufacture the tests. On May 13, it was disclosed that while in the quarantine system imposed by the government of British Columbia on international arrivals, eight farm workers out of 1,500 had tested positive for COVID-19 disease. The province started allowing imported farmhands in April and is the only province to implement mandatory quarantine. Ontario has had dozens of cases with imported farmhands. In the west, \\"if the new arrivals have no symptoms when they land, they are sent to hotels near Vancouver International Airport. The province is paying for the rooms, food service and worker support costs during the 14-day self-isolation period. During that time, employers are responsible for paying their temporary foreign workers for a minimum 30 hours a week, at the hourly rate that they would make while working. As well, farm operators are required to demonstrate proof of an infection control plan with the Ministry of Agriculture. So far, 219 farms have submitted health plans online, and 133 inspections have been completed to make sure farms are safely equipped and organized to manage COVID-19 risks.\\" On May 14, the Globe and Mail Editorial Board endorsed restrictive measures on international travellers patterned on those implemented in the HKSAR. while the Lufthansa Group announced it would resume flights between Toronto and Frankfurt as of June 3, as part of its resumption of global business. Also on May 14, Sean Fine observed that Section 6 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms enshrines mobility rights, such as \\"the right to enter, remain in and leave the country; citizens and permanent residents may move to, pursue work and reside anywhere in the country.\\" On May 15, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer told a press conference that the Conservative caucus wanted Parliament to resume sitting as normal on May 25 and desired to withhold their consent to the 35-day rolling adjournment that prevents the regular operation of Parliament. Scheer observed that \\"Elected members of Parliament come here to be a voice for their constituents.\\" Because all-party consent is required to suspend the animation of Parliament, it will need to resume sitting. On May 19 it came to light during a press conference with Trudeau and Tam that the 20th week of 2020 versus the same figures in 2019 saw a drop of 88 percent in land border crossers, and a 98 percent drop in international air travel. The following day CPHO Tam reversed her decision from March on the wearing of masks and began asking Canadians to start wearing masks. On May 20, a resident of Nova Scotia who was barred from attending her mother's funeral in Newfoundland gave notice to the province of her intent to sue in Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court because she felt that her rights under Section 6 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated, and that provinces cannot enforce bans because they have no enumerated powers to do so. On May 21, it came to light that the Canadian Armed Forces, who had been tasked previously in Operation LASER with care for the senior citizens in the Long-Term Care Facilities of Ontario and Quebec had potentially been victimised by a COVID-19 SSEV. The disease affected 25 soldiers as of this date, but neither the CAF nor the DND would divulge details. On May 22, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu interrupted a line of questions to the CPHO from an opposition MP because he was probing why the National Emergency Stockpile System (NESS) had been underfunded while Canadians showered hundreds of times more money abroad. In 2006, Dr Theresa Tam, who was later to become the CPHO, was a lead author for the CPIP document. The 2006 report advises that there be a 16-week stockpile of medical supplies in the NESS to cover two pandemic waves. On May 25, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence Anita Vandenbeld disclosed to the third sitting of the resumed 43rd Canadian Parliament that 36 soldiers from Operation LASER had been infected with COVID-19 disease. Vandenbeld corrected for the record Cheryl Gallant who had been under the mistaken impression that only 28 soldiers (12 positives in Ontario and 16 in Quebec) had been infected. Also on that day, Doug Ford announced that Ontario had a heat map of the outbreak locations, and that Brampton, north Etobicoke, Scarborough, Peel Region, Windsor and Essex County were \\"lighting up like Christmas trees\\". It was disclosed that Toronto-area public health units account for 65% of cases in Ontario. The next day, it was disclosed that the Ontario OpLASER LTCFs suffered in human resources from a form of disrepair, decay and dilapidation. The DND chose this day to release a letter by Brigadier-General CJJ Mialkowski dated May 14 in which he reported the unvarnished truth as he and his soldiers found it. The five Ontario OpLASER LCTFs were: * Eatonville Care Centre, 420 The East Mall Etobicoke M9B 3Z9 * Hawthorne Place Care Centre, 2045 Finch Ave West North York M3N 1M9 * Orchard Villa, 1955 Valley Farm Pickering L1V 3R6 * Altamont Care Community, 92 Island Ave Scarborough M1C 2P5 * Holland Christian ‚Äì Grace Manor, 7900 McLaughlin Road Brampton L6Y 5A7  June 2020  On June 18, 2020, Canada reached 100,000 coronavirus cases, a little over three months since the suspension of Parliament for the same reason. A CBC News tally of reported deaths from COVID-19 on the same date was 8,348. On June 24, Fitch Ratings Inc., a bond ratings agency, downgraded Canada's credit rating from triple-A to double-A- plus. The government had sported a triple-A credit rating with Fitch since the Martin government. On June 25, former Clerk of the Privy Council of Canada Michael Wernick predicted that the one of the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic would be the shrinkage of the number of paid civil servants of Canada. He drew analogies to the debt problem in the 1980s which led \\"to a 1995 austerity budget that saw 45,000 public service jobs slashed, the elimination of 73 federal agencies, a 21 per cent reduction in foreign aid and the privatization of Canadian National Railways.\\" Wernick said that: On June 28, it was remarked in light of the March 18 COVID-19 closure of the Canada-US border, that the CBSA was practiced at separating common-law couples who could provide no documentary evidence (e.g. housing rental contracts or mortgage documents) of their joint residence. David Poon, a 34 year old medical doctor from Regina, was one of the victims of this policy and started the 1,600-strong organization Advocacy for Family Reunification at the Canadian Border because  July 2020  The western provinces reported a surge in cases around the middle of July. Ontario reported 203 new cases in one day, Quebec reported 180 new cases in 24 hours, Alberta reported 368 new cases over the weekend, and Saskatchewan reported 120 in a previous week.  August 2020  An employee at The Brass Rail strip club in Toronto tested positive for COVID-19 after working on four days, potentially exposing about 550 people to the illness. On August 26, a 72 year-old New Zealand mariner named Peter Smith was threatened by Transport Canada as his Kiwi Roa sailed through the Northwest Passage, because the government \\"prohibited pleasure craft from operating in Arctic waters\\" from June 1 \\"to better protect Arctic communities\\" from COVID-19. Smith opined that the bureaucracy is \\"out of control and gone mad.\\"  September 2020  In early September, federal Minister of Transport Marc Garneau remarked that airline passengers face a $1000 penalty fine if they refuse to wear a mask. The penalty was imposed in separate incidents (in June then July) on the first two passengers in September in order for others to reflect on the punished behaviour. Face coverings have been mandatory on flights since April 20. \\"Federal transport officials\\" were charged with issuing the fines \\"under the federal order\\". The same week, WestJet announced a new policy that include a 12-month long ban for passengers who ignored aircrew instructions to don masks. The PHAC stated that 378 domestic and 595 international flights between March 2 and August 24 had travellers on board who may have had the disease during their trip. On September 7, Hajdu ordered an \\"independent review\\" of the \\"early warning system\\" after media reports in July documented how the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), formerly a PHAC subgroup, was deemed by a senior bureaucrat to be unnecessary, and the specially trained doctors and epidemiologists at GPHIN were reassigned to other tasks before May 24, 2019, when a \\"department edict that all such alerts had to be approved by senior managers inside PHAC\\" was issued under Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor. The changes led to inarticulateness \\"particularly in situations where foreign governments were trying to hide or play down the event.\\" Some GPHIN scientists were concerned that there were \\"layers of department officials who lacked a sufficient background in science\\". The COVID-19 pandemic served to focus the mind of Hajdu, as well as the notice that on July 30 the Auditor General of Canada had started an investigation into the affair. On September 8, 2020, the Mayor of Longueil Sylvie Parent tested positive for COVID-19. On 16 September it came to light in a news story on the life of Liz Uihlein (the owner of Uline) that under Order-in-Council #2020-0524, \\"four cabinet members ‚Äî Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu and Minister of Immigration Marco Mendicino and Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam\\" or members of their departments have the power to issue exemptions on quarantine restrictions for international travellers. The CBSA, which lies under the authority of Blair, issued the exemption that triggered the news story. Because Parliament was prorogued Blair only issued a tweet and it was unlikely that his CBSA staff member had been disciplined. On September 18, 2020, Conservative Party leader Erin O'Toole tested positive for COVID-19, after a staffer in his office tested positive. The same day, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet also tested positive. On September 23, in a speech from the throne, Prime Minister Trudeau declared Canada was experiencing its second wave of COVID-19. In a September 30 clampdown, Quebec gave police the legal powers \\"to enter homes quickly to stop gatherings during COVID-19\\". Police officers \\"will be able to obtain warrants faster through a new, virtual system that was established in collaboration with the Crown... Normally the process for obtaining a warrant can take a day or two, but that won't work when police want to break up parties that very same evening,\\" said premier Legault. Public Security Minister Genevi√®ve Guilbault said \\"We had to give the police the means to intervene.\\" She said that the right to peaceful protest \\"without masks cannot be tolerated\\" and she is not ruling out using force to disperse protests if needed. \\"Eventually, we will cross that bridge when we get there,\\" she said. October 2020 It was reported on 4 October that an African man who had somehow bypassed the 14-day quarantine on international travellers and travelled onwards from Toronto to Halifax and thence to Deer Lake, Newfoundland had then died of COVID-19. Health officials decided to raise the alarm and request that passengers on the final leg of his flight \\"self-monitor for symptoms\\".

The latter is an example of a non-armed, violent non-state actor at sea, as they nevertheless have engaged in violence. Both Neptune's Navy and pirates are also examples of non-state actors whose role is a matter of perspective. Neptune's Navy believe themselves to be environmentalist, while the ICRW and the Japanese government has labeled them terrorists. Similarly, pirates off the coast of Somalia claim to be \\"freedom fighters\\" defending Somali waters from pollution and foreign access.  Terrorist non-state actors at sea  Some authors in Maritime Security point to the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 as a pivotal moment of maritime terrorism. This bombing preceded the 9/11-attacks as an example of a direct and obviously malicious attack against a state by a non-state actor. The bombings also became crucial for private security companies: in the wake of the attack, Blackwater (now Academi) signed its first contract with US military. Terrorist non-state actors at sea have also been linked with pirates. NATO concluded in 2010 that terrorism could be linked with piracy and illegal fishing. This has been criticized however, by other authors, who believe a relation between pirates and terrorists bring no mutual benefits.  Private military companies at sea  Actors such as Academi have been, or are in possession of vessels such as the NOAAS McArthur, but most provide services that deliver armed personnel on board cargo ships. Some authors argue that because private security companies are composed largely of retired military personnel from industrialized/western countries, and because they also collaborate with the same countries, they are perceived as merely an extension tool for liberal governments to get involved in conflicts, or at the very least, they function on a basis of borrowed legitimacy from their partnered countries. This might imply that while they are technically non-state actors, they benefit from being perceived as directly related to a state.

It was known for the annual \\"high-profile\\" Manning Networking Conference (MNC). The Manning Centre operates the for-profit think tank the Manning Foundation, which undertakes some research and analysis, while the Manning Centre self- describes as a \\"do-tank\\", that focuses on advocacy, training and networking events for conservatives. Administration The Centre is managed by the board of directors with Troy Lanigan as president. Lanigan was formerly president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, an organization that advocates for lower taxes, less waste in public sector spending and more government accountability. Current members of the board of directors include Joe Oliver, who served as Finance Minister under then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and is now on the board of directors of High Arctic Energy Services. Cliff Fryers, Jocelyn Williams Bamford, Chuck Strahl, and Questerre Energy's CEO Michael Binnion, who also serves on the High Arctic Energy Services board, and Preston Manning. Preston Manning , was the founding father of the Centre and served as its director until July 2016, when he resigned from his executive functions with the Manning Foundation and the Centre. He continued to support and pursue its objectives. On January 16, 2020 Manning announced that he was retiring from the Centre, to spend more time with his family. Members of the board of trustees have included former Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris and Gwyn Morgan , who has also served as a trustee of the Fraser Institute's, and on the board of directors of SNC-Lavalin and EnCana Corporation. In 2003, Morgan was \\"the most powerful man in Canada's oil patch\\", according to Maclean's magazine. Past directors include Kevin Lacey, the Atlantic representative of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Activities and mandate The Manning Centre supports small government, free market, and individual liberties and promotes \\"Canada's conservative movement.\\" The motto is \\"Networking Canada's Conservative Movement\\". The Manning Centre trains people to participate in federal, provincial and/or municipal partisan politics. The Manning Centre self-describes as a \\"do-tank\\" not a think tank as it \\"does not try to generate new ideas.\\" In his 2016 publication on the \\"global think tank phenomenon\\", Donald E. Abelson described the different functions of the Manning Foundation, the Manning Centre and the Manning Networking Conference. While Jan Gerson's September 20, 2014 National Post profile of five Canadian think tanks included the Manning Centre, Abelson said that MCBD does not \\"conduct research and analysis\\", which is the function of the for-profit institute, the Manning Foundation. The Foundation is the think tank and the MCBD helps \\"educate and train future leaders of the conservative movement\\" by \\"offering internships and sponsoring various educational programs, seminars, and workshops\\", and by participating in \\"several partisan-related activities and events\\". He said that the \\"express purpose\\" of the MNC is to \\"organize larger events at which policy-makers, academics, journalists, students, donors, and other groups of individuals can interact.\\" The Centre's charitable branch the Manning Foundation does conducts some research and provides a way for donors to support them. However Manning said that neither the Centre or the Foundation conduct original research. He said that instead of \\"trying to compete or replace the conservative-oriented think tanks, The Centre is \\"basically trying to take much of the work [think tanks] do, interpret it and try to translate it into some action that results in the implementation of policies.\\" The Manning Centre has often been compared to the progressive and social democratic think tank Broadbent Institute, which was established in 2011. They were both founded by \\"former political party leaders\\" and they both \\"identify as partisan organizations\\". However, the Broadbent Institute and the Manning Foundation‚Äîunlike other organizations operating within the think tank sector‚Äîare not registered as charities‚Äîwhich \\"allows them to operate without limits on their partisanship\\". Both organizations focus on \\"communicating and developing the skills of the masses and attempting to influence public policy from the bottom up\\". Funding The annual budget of the Manning Centre is not made public. However, in a 2011 presentation, Nicholas Gafuik, who was then a MC Senior Fellow and previously a managing director, said that since its inception in 2005, the Manning Centre had won \\"commitments for funding\\" of about $30 million, which represented about $4 million a year. Some corporate sponsors support both the Manning Networking Conference and the Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit. Banks and the petroleum industry tend to support the MNC while labour unions tended to support the Progress Summit. The lead sponsor of the Manning Networking Conference 2019 held in March in Ottawa was the Modern Miracle Network (MMN), an advocacy organization that was incorporated in 2016 by Michael Binnion and operates out of Questerre Energy's offices. Background Preston Manning founded the Manning Centre for Building Democracy in 2005 and the Manning Foundation, shortly after he retired from a lengthy career in politics. Manning and Mike Harris wrote a series together that was published by the Fraser Institute including \\"A Canada Strong and Free\\" in 2005, \\"Rebalanced and revitalized: A Canada strong and free\\" and \\"Building Prosperity in a Canada Strong and Free\\" in 2006, International Leadership by a Canada Strong and Free in May 2017 and \\"Vision for a Canada Strong and Free\\" in 2007. The Manning Centre provided a networking opportunity for \\"conservatives from different provincial parties\\", and their \\"federal counterparts\\" and a space to \\"exchange ideas and propose policy initiatives\\", according to Chuck Strahl, who was Manning Centre's chairman and had served as a Reform MP and Conservative cabinet minister under Prime Minister Harper. Prior to the creation of the Manning Centre, there \\"wasn't a networking opportunity for what Preston always called the 'conservative movement,' as opposed to political parties.\\" Preston believed that \\"the conservative movement benefit[ed] from getting together, in all of its facets, and without having the party hierarchy managing it or overlooking it. This was the best way to get the best conservative ideas.\\" Conservatives that the MC targets include \\"card-carrying Tory loyalists\\", \\"those who feel more comfortable outside the tent\\", and \\"those who lean more towards the libertarian or social conservative side of the true-blue ideological spectrum.\\" There is an interlocking of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Manning Centre at the level of the board of directors, staff members, and participation at the annual conferences. In 2018, as the Centre shifted away from advocacy and towards the increased focus on hosting conferences. As a result, about 50 percent of the permanent staff were laid off and part of its Calgary downtown building was leased. In 2020, Lanigan said that the Centre and the Manning Networking Conference were in the process of being renamed and \\"rebranded\\". The newly branded entity will continue to break \\"down silos\\"‚Äî\\"getting conservatives to work together and work strategically to create opportunities for success\\", as Manning had done. The rebranding will not change the mandate of \\"supporting conservatism in Canada...by networking best practices and ideas pertaining to limited government, free enterprise, individual responsibility and a more robust civil society.\\" Manning Networking Conference For twelve years, the Manning Centre organized the annual \\"high-profile\\" Manning Networking Conference. Global News journalist Tom Clark said that Manning Networking Conference (MNC) was like \\"Woodstock for Conservative Canadians.\\" and the Hill Times called it the Coachella for conservatives. In 2010, Nicholas Gafuik, who was at that time the Executive Director of the Manning Centre, said the reason behind the 2010 Manning Centre's Conference on Alberta's Future was that Alberta was in a \\"time of change\\" and there was a \\"need to generate ideas, proposals, and plans for shaping a more positive and inspiring future\\" for Alberta. Keynote speakers included Mark Milke from the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, Michael Percy, Marlo Raynolds from the Pembina Institute, Peter McCormick, Peter Cowley and Nadeem Esmail from the Fraser Institute, and Monte Solberg a former Federal Minister. The 2011 MNC included Nicholas Gafuik as a key speaker. The 2013 Manning Networking Conference (MNC13) key note speakers included Ezra Levant, Ron Paul, and Jason Kenney. In 2014, CBC News described the two-day annual conference, which was then in its sixth year, as a \\"pre-spring tradition\\" where \\"small- and big-C conservatives\\" converge in Ottawa to \\"hobnob with senior federal cabinet ministers, talk policy with provincial premiers and trade tips with some of the country's most successful campaign strategists.\\" The CBC said that the MNC had \\"grown steadily in size, scope and ‚Äî perhaps most critically ‚Äî influence within Canada's conservative movement.\\" The \\"political debate\\" was \\"spirited and substantial\\" and the \\"ManningFest\\" was at that time \\"one of the hottest political tickets in town.\\" Key speakers included Mark Steyn, Jim Prentice, Brad Wall and Ross Douthat. Breakout sessions included speakers such as Jason Kenney, Dimitri Pantazopoulos on \\"Conservatives and the City\\", Susan Delacourt on \\"Shopping for Votes\\", Paul Wells on \\"The Longer I'm Prime Minister\\", Bob Plamandon \\"The Truth About Trudeau\\", and Tom Flanagan on \\"Winning Power\\". There was a panel for journalists which include CBC News Network's Power & Politics contributors, John Ivison from the National Post, Jennifer Ditchburn from the Canadian Press, Bob Fife from CTV News, and Luiza Ch. Savage from Maclean's. Key speakers at the at the 2015 Manning Networking Conference (MNC15), which was held on March 7 and 8, included Christy Clark, Jim Prentice, Darrell Pasloski, Tony Clement and James Moore. Topics discussed included \\"Technology and Politics\\" \\"Perpetual Fundraising Machine\\", \\"income-splitting\\", \\"market-based environmentalism, euthanasia The Supreme Court had just overturned the ban against physician-assisted suicide., \\"Islamic extremism, municipalities and the runaway Supreme Court\\". Jason Kenney, who was then serving as Defence Minister under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, gave a speech on \\"defending Canada's values and interests\\" and Strahl talk was on the \\"State of the Conservative Movement.\\" In his March 2015 article, National Post columnist Andrew Coyne described as \\"emptiness\\" and \\"careerism\\" displaying \\"how vapid Canadian conservatism has become.\\" Sponsors for the tenth annual MNC held in Ottawa for four days in February, included Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), and CN Railways, according to Maclean's. Questerre Energy's CEO, Micheal Binnion, who is also on the CAPP's board of governors, was a prominent speaker at the 2018 MNC. During the panel discussion entitled \\"Development and Sustainability\\", Binnion took credit for outlining the \\"key elements of the Conservative's energy platform\\". Binnion suggested alternatives to the carbon tax introduced by federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Binnion notes included alternatives such as \\"regulation by target reductions\\", \\"targeted regulation by caps\\", an \\"incentive-based approach\\", \\"conservationism\\", \\"green technology credits, or doing nothing until Canada‚Äôs trading partners demand it.\\" Municipal governance project In early March 2013 at a conference in Ottawa, David Seymour, a Manning senior fellow the project manager for the Manning Centre's municipal governance project‚ÄîDimitri Pantazopoulos, described the changes they wanted to see in municipal politics which they described as a \\"field dominated by over-spenders and over-regulators\\". The Manning Centre launched their municipal governance project during the 2013 Calgary municipal election, providing free seminars and receiving free training to five municipal candidates in five wards, as part of their \\"mission to make city halls across Canada more conservative\\". Calgarians have voted conservative at the federal and provincial level but are far less conservative at the municipal level. The candidate \\"largely agree[d] that city council needs to be more conservative\\".Pantazopoulos did \\"strategy and public opinion research\\" for both Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Joe Clark, and more recently for Ontario premier Doug Ford and as \\"senior strategic adviser\\" for Jason Kenney's UCP campaign. 2019 Canadian federal election In the run up to the 2019 Canadian federal election, the Manning Centre provided a \\"total of $312,450 to a network of related third-party advertising groups\\" operating on Facebook and Instagram. This included $240,000 to Canada Strong and Proud for a \\"series of anti-Trudeau and anti-Liberal campaign ads.\\" The Centre also \\"gave $4,500 to Newfoundland and Labrador Strong and another $11,200 to Nova Scotia Strong. In 2018, Manning called for a \\"co-ordinated response\\" by governments, companies, and citizens Canadians to the opposition against pipelines, by creating a Corridors Coalition. The Coalition would create and maintain a transportation corridor for Canadian oil and natural resources, running from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and eventually to the Arctic Ocean. Manning called for the creation of the Coalition for mid-2019 to \\"offer a clear and powerful challenge to the federal political parties contesting the 2019 federal election in the fall\\".

She stated that she wanted her presidency to be remembered as a pragmatic mandate.  Professional career  Deschamps was the last IFLA President to serve before the International Federation of Librarians' statutes were changed to a model where instead of electing the president, an elected president would be elected two years before becoming president of the Federation. She was re-elected after her 4-year term (1997 to 2001) to serve for two more years as president (2001 to 2003), where she promoted the work of libraries in the global information age, education, and standards development. Before becoming president of the International Federation of Librarians, Deschamps held various positions at Parisian university libraries and also at the Ministry of Education in France. = Libraries and the World Summit on the Information Society = Deschamps called for libraries to be recognized at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society as key participants in closing the digital divide. The digital divide and internet filters were topics that she worked on during the World Information Congresses. Under her mandate, the First World Report on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom was established and she made statements on electronic publications and copyright. This work confirmed two committees in the Federation of Librarians: the Committee on Copyright (Copyright and other legal issues or CLM for its acronym) and the Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Access to information (FAIFE). = Internationalization of the library sector = Deschamps worked to decentralize the International Federation of Librarians (IFLA). She explained that she felt \\"that rebalancing power in the IFLA organization is necessary because there is a lot of influence from Europe and North America\\" and that developing countries should have a greater participation in the Federation. In 1999, Deschamps and Jay Jordan of the Online Computer Library Centre (OCLC) announced the creation of the IFLA/OCLC Early Career Development Fellowship to enable librarians from developing countries to go to the United States for training and to visit North American Libraries.

It follows the story of a young soldier who returns home after a few years of being at the front lines, and discovers that things are not how he had left them. It is a take on the current political climate in Kashmir  Plot  Set in the village of Kulgam in modern day Kashmir, Lt. Shiv Raina returns home after two years of training to become a soldier. A happy-go-lucky fellow, Shiv is only coming home for one purpose: to meet the love of his life again, Inayat, and this time ask for her hand in marriage. When he gets home, he's greeted by a grim Inayat who has no answers to his questions about why she never responded to his letters. There's a clear sorrow on her face that Shiv chooses to overlook, and does his best to cheer her up. As time goes on, Inayat starts to remember why she fell in love with her childhood best friend, and starts to reciprocate his feelings. As Shiv makes himself comfortable at Inayat's home, he asks the whereabouts of her brother Zahir, to which neither she nor her father respond. Their despondent looks indicate that something has gone wrong in the past couple of years but Shiv doesn't know what. As the story unfolds, Shiv meets Zahir, and finds out that he has joined the a group of terrorists who want to claim Kashmir to be theirs. Shiv is disappointed and tries to reason with Zahir who justifies his feelings towards his cause, and his utter disdain towards the Indian Army that he claims has raped Muslim women and murdered Muslim men. Realizing that there will be no middle ground between the two men, Inayat distracts them by offering them both some food. The same night, Zahir tells Inayat to put poison in Shiv's morning coffee. Stuck between her love and her brother, she pleads with Zahir to spare Shiv's life, but Zahir doesn't listen to her. Shiv hears the entire conversation from his bedroom. Next morning, Shiv wakes up, sad and hurt, thinking that Inayat might try and carry out her brother's plan. He has a long banter with Inayat who denies knowing anything about any poison. As the fight goes on, Zahir enters and confronts Shiv. They both question each others motives, and Zahir pulls a gun out of his pocket. Angered, Shiv tells Zahir to shoot at him. Seeing this, Inayat is heartbroken and she runs to her room. Zahir and Shiv continue to fight, and amidst the hustle, Zahir accidentally pulls the trigger killing Shiv. Hearing the gunshot go off, Inayat and Zahir's father runs into the room to witness the murder that his son has just committed. He then runs to the backroom to find Inayat hanging from the ceiling fan. Cast *Kinshuk Sen as Lt.

A special screening event was held on the day of the release. Controversy In October 2017, filmmaker Bhargav Saikia accused the director, Palash Sen, of plagiarism. ‚ÄúI am appalled to see an established and celebrated musician like Palash Sen using unethical and illegal means to present his first film as a director,‚Äù Saikia said.‚ÄúThe makers of ‚ÄòJiya Jaye‚Äô have re-used shots from ‚ÄòKaafiron Ki Namaaz‚Äô without permission from my production company, Lorien Motion Pictures,‚Äù he added. Palash Sen addressed the issue stating ‚ÄúWe started our investigation and found out that the footage was indeed available in a folder called STOCK. We used it without any wrong intent or malice. We are first time filmmakers making a short film. Euphoria is known to have NEVER violated copyrights and were ourselves victims at various points. Making such a public noise made us wonder what was this guy looking for.. Was it publicity that he never got when his film released (We too just heard the name of his film) or money.. or attention.. ? we suspect this footage was put out in the public domain and the intent was malicious,‚Äù the post read.

He was a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.  Biography  Lismonde lived in the villa called ¬´ Les Roches ¬ª where he spent 50 years of his life with his wife Albertine De Wispelaere (6 August 190823 October 1997). = Beginnings = Lismonde started drawing as a child, and was brought up in an artistic family that admired the work of Steinlen, Forain and fashionable English drawers. While a student at the Royal Athenaeum of Brussels, he collaborated to the Pallas review by publishing his drawings and caricatures there. Since he played the flute, he hesitated between a musical and artistic career, but he settled on the visual arts. As a young man, as early as 1925, he started painting the Brabantian countryside with painter Edgar Bytebier [fr] (1875-1940). = Career = After practicing oil painting, of which there remain a few examples (portraits, landscapes), he became passionate about drawing in a refined expression in black and white. It was also then that he discovered etching. In 1934, Jean Groffier [fr] wrote : ¬´ As a painter, let it be said, Lismonde was not a colorist. Under the painter's brush, a drawer was hiding. His colour is sad, wary, his effects are gray; but of a delicious melancholy. Actually, the \\"landscaper\\" that is Lismonde is one of the most interesting characters of the Belgian visual arts world and whose name will soon cross our borders. ¬ª.Jean Groffier, ¬´ Le paysagiste Lismonde ¬ª, in : Tribune 1934, n¬∞ 15, Brussels, September 1934, p. 3. In French : ¬´ En tant que peintre, disons-le de suite, Lismonde n'est pas un coloriste. Sous le pinceau du peintre se cache avant tout le dessinateur. Sa couleur est triste, inqui√®te, ses effets sont gris ; mais d'une d√©licieuse m√©lancolie. En fait, le paysagiste Lismonde est une des personnalit√©s les plus int√©ressantes du monde pictural belge et dont le nom d√©passera bient√¥t les limites de nos fronti√®res ¬ª Though he did not exactly fit into any artistic \\"school\\", he participated in 1945 in the creation of the movement ¬´ Jeune Peinture belge [fr] ¬ª () and to the group called ¬´ Cap d'Encre ¬ª. Lismonde was also a portrait painter and he completed in the 1930s and 40s a series of portraits, especially in charcoal, of personalities from the intellectual and literary world of his time like the poets Luc Indestege, Maurice Car√™me, Gaston Heux [fr], the writers Constant Burniaux [fr], Louis Lebeer, the philosopher Marcel De Corte [fr], the architect L√©on Van Dievoet or the painters Charles Dehoy [fr] or Jacques Veraart [fr].Serge Goyens de Heusch, Lismonde portraitiste, 2016. = Exhibitions = His first personal exhibition took place in 1930 where his paintings were particularly popular. An exhibition of his works at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in 1953 officially consecrated his art. Then he had personal exhibitions in Venice, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1950. The 9th biennale of Black&White; of Lugano dedicated him a room. In 1958, he represented Belgium at the 1958 Venice Biennale where he won the Renato Carrain Prize. There are tapestries and a sculpture by him in the P√©tillon metro station in Brussels.  Documentary  In 1978, Patrick Van Antwerpen produced a documentary on Lismonde.  The Lismonde Foundation  Lismonde donated his house to the municipality of Linkebeek, it now serves as a place for music, meetings and exhibitions.

She was also one of the founders of the Virginia League of Women Voters.  Early Life  Elizabeth Dabney Langhorne was born in 1851 in Botetourt County, Virginia. As a child, she lived in Lynchburg. She went to private schools in Lynchburg and Charlottesville. As a young woman, she taught in a number of schools in the Lynchburg area. In August 1873 she married John Henry Lewis. He was a civil war veteran and an attorney. Lewis was elected president of the Lynchburg Women's Club twice. She was an accomplished pianist and was active in the Lynchburg artistic community.  Suffrage Activity  Elizabeth Langhorne Lewis helped to carry the Virginia banner in the Woman Suffrage Procession on the eve of Woodrow Wilson's inauguration Lewis was the founder and president of the Lynchburg Equal Suffrage League. The group, founded in October 1910, created petitions in support of women's suffrage addressed to the Virginia General Assembly and gave presentations to local groups. The group also published the Lynchburg Woman's Suffrage News in April 1917, printing 5,000 copies. In December 1911, Lewis was elected vice-president of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia and served in that role until the league dissolved after the passage of the 19th amendment. In March, 1913, Lewis helped to carry Virginia's banner in the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, DC, the first large organized march on Washington for political purposes. In October 1913, the annual meeting of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was organized by the Lynchburg Equal Suffrage League. Lewis wrote an article for Virginia Suffrage News, published in November 1914. In it, she wrote \\"that the woman's qualification for citizenship is as valid as the man's‚Äîthat her identity of interest, her intelligence, her morality, her patriotism and her proven efficiency\\" entitled women to all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship for which \\"equal suffrage is an indispensable element.\\" Lewis presented numerous speeches about suffrage in Southern Virginia in 1915 and 1916, organizing a number of suffrage leagues in the cities where she spoke. During this time, the league was undergoing rapid growth. In 1914, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia had 45 local chapters. In 1916, there were 115 chapters. In 1915, she represented Lila Valentine at a national suffrage convention. In 1916, Lewis and her daughter Elizabeth Otey helped to persuade the Virginia Republican Party state convention to endorse women's suffrage. On 2 October 1916, she debated Congressman Henry DeLaWarr Flood in Appomatox County. Flood was against extending the vote to women and was an influential voice within the Virginia Democratic Party. After Virginia declined to pass a state-level suffrage amendment in 1916, Lewis focused on lobbying Virginia's congressional delegation in support of a federal constitutional amendment, known as the Susan B. Anthony amendment. She picketed the White House in 1917, accompanied by her daughter Elizabeth Otey. The group's banner read \\"Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self- governed? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governed. Take the beam out of your own eye.\\" It was snatched away as the march began. In the spring of 1918, her cousin Lila Valentine, the president of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia had a serious operation. Lewis took over the running of the league.  League of Women Voters  The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia disbanded on November 8, 1920, and the Virginia League of Women Voters was organized two days later at the state capitol. Lewis was elected to the first board of directors. In 1926-27, she was president of the state league. She was president of the Lynchburg chapter of the league for more than a decade after it was formed in 1920.  Death  Lewis died in Lynchburg on 30 January 1946. She was 94 years old. Her remains were buried next to those of her husband.

Rising to junior command positions during the Russian Civil War, Anashkin held command and staff positions. He was arrested during the Great Purge but released, and after Operation Barbarossa began became a division chief of staff. He commanded the 160th Rifle Division from late 1941 to mid-1942 and the 159th Rifle Division in the Battle of Stalingrad. The latter was converted into the 61st Guards for its actions and Anashkin rose to corps command, leading the 19th, 33rd, and 64th Rifle Corps until early 1944. For the rest of the war, he commanded the 129th Rifle Corps, and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of it in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive during early 1945. Ill health resulted in his early retirement after the end of the war.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Anashkin was born to a peasant family on 19 November 1901 in the village of Koma, Yeniseysk Governorate, and completed primary school. He joined the partisan detachment of Pyotr Shchetinkin in November 1919 during the Russian Civil War and operated with it in Yeniseysk Governorate. When partisan detachments were reorganized into regular Red Army units in March 1920, Anashkin continued his service with the 239th Kursk Rifle Regiment of the 27th Omsk Rifle Division. After graduating from the divisional school, he served with the 239th as a squad leader and starshina. With the 5th Army of the Eastern Front, Anashkin fought in battles against the remnants of White forces. In late June the division was relocated to the Western Front and as part of the 16th Army fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War on the Berezina in the area of Smolevichi and Ozerishche. On 11 July the 27th captured Minsk, then fought in the breakthrough of the fortified positions at Baranovichi, the capture of Slonim, and the crossing of the Bug. In August the division fought in the Battle of Warsaw before retreating back into Belarus. From January 1921, Anashkin served as a platoon commander and acting company commander with the 239th in fighting against anti-Soviet forces in Vitebsk, Minsk, and Gomel Governorates, and in March he participated in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, then in the suppression of anti-Soviet forces in the Volga Military District.  Interwar period  Anashkin served as a starshina in the 6th Tsaritsyn Regiment of the Volga Military District from May 1922, then in the same position with the 96th and 99th Rifle Regiments. From June 1924 he commanded a platoon in the 99th Regiment, before being sent to study at the Smolensk Infantry School in September. After the latter was disbanded in September 1926 Anashkin transferred to the Ryazan Infantry School. Upon his graduation in October 1927, he was appointed a platoon commander in the 66th Rifle Regiment of the 22nd Rifle Division. Anashkin completed the Moscow Military-Political Course between October 1928 and July 1929, being appointed commander and politruk of a company of the 78th Rifle Regiment of the 26th Rifle Division of the Special Far Eastern Army, with which he fought in the Sino-Soviet conflict later that year. Transferred to the 118th Rifle Regiment of the 40th Rifle Division in June 1931, Anashkin served with it as a company politruk, company commander, and assistant chief of staff of the training battalion. Sent to study at the Frunze Military Academy for advanced training in February 1932, Anashkin was appointed assistant chief of the 1st (operational) department of the staff of the 7th Rifle Corps in the Kiev Military District upon his graduation in May 1936. He served as chief of staff of the 23rd Rifle Division from May 1937, but was arrested on 1 August 1938 during the Great Purge. Imprisoned under investigation until 27 February 1939, Anashkin was released and reinstated in the army, becoming an instructor at the tactics and staff service department of the Frunze Military Academy in April.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Anashkin, now a lieutenant colonel, was appointed chief of staff of the 282nd Rifle Division, forming in the Moscow Military District, in July 1941. With the division, he went to the Bryansk Front and fought in battles in the area of Pochep and Trubchevsk as part of the 3rd Army. His tenure with the 282nd proved brief as in September Anashkin was appointed commander of the 160th Rifle Division of the 13th Army. With the latter, he was encircled in the area of Trubchevsk during Operation Typhoon in October. The division managed to break out and mounted an organized retreat towards Sevsk and Lgov. In late 1941 and the first half of 1942, Anashkin, promoted to colonel on 9 January, led the division in defensive fighting in the Voronezh region, the Yelets Offensive, the offensive towards Oryol, and the Battle of Voronezh. He was relieved of command of the division in June. Anashkin did not wait long for a new assignment as in July he took command of the 159th Rifle Division. On 9 July the division joined the 60th Army for fighting on the east bank of the Don and the defense of Voronezh, and on 1 August was withdrawn into the army reserve. From 22 August the division transferred to the 40th Army and was relocated to the Usman area. Attacking towards Voronezh on 12 September, Anashkin's unit assisted in the destruction of the German Chizhovka bridgehead and repulsed counterattacks for the next month. Transferred to the 5th Tank Army, Anashkin led the 159th in the attack towards Morozovsk during Operation Uranus. With the 3rd Guards Army from 14 December, the division fought in Operation Little Saturn and captured Morozovsk, being converted into the 61st Guards Rifle Division for its actions on 15 January; Anashkin received a promotion to major general on the same day. Anashkin continued to command the 61st Guards during Operation Gallop in early 1943. He rose to command the 19th Rifle Corps on 28 February, and in April he became commander of the new 33rd Rifle Corps, which included the divisions of the 19th. After leading the corps in actions in the area of Starobilsk, Anashkin became commander of the 64th Rifle Corps of the 57th Army in July.

Precipitated by previous strike action by linemen of Georgia Railway earlier that year, the strike began on September 30 and ended January 5 of the following year. The main goals of the strike included increased pay, shorter working hours, and union recognition. The strike ended with the operators receiving a wage increase, and subsequent strike action the following year lead to union recognition.  Background  The streetcar strike followed a previous labor dispute regarding linemen of the Georgia Railway and Power Company earlier that year. In June, the linemen requested a ten percent wage increase from the company, which was refused. Following this, the linemen brought William Pollard of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) to the city to help organize a labor strike (a local of the IBEW in Atlanta had been established years earlier in 1890). On August 12, the linemen went on strike over the firing of five linemen, of whom three had union affiliations. The strike ended as the company agreed to reinstate the two non- union affiliated men and, while not recognizing the IBEW, did acknowledge the linemen's right to unionize. The local newspapers gave relatively little coverage of the event. Preston S. Arkwright, then-President of Georgia Railway and Power, alleged that following this incident, Pollard began to assist in the unionizing of the streetcar operators. Hardy Teat of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen assisted, and together they began to organize streetcar operators under the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). On September 28, Pollard was called to the offices of the Atlanta Chief of Police under accusations of plans to incite violence and a riot. Two days later, Pollard was called to testify before Atlanta Mayor James G. Woodward, where Woodward warned him that he would be arrested if a strike were to occur.  Course of the strike  On September 30 at 6 pm, Teat called The Atlanta Journal to notify them that a strike involving conductors and motormen of the Atlanta Railway had commenced. The main goals of the strike were higher wages, union recognition, and shorter hours. Additionally, the strikers were opposed to the mandatory membership in the company's \\"benevolent society\\", which required dues of 50 cents per month. In downtown Atlanta, several streetcars were left abandoned as the operators deserted their posts. Because of the profile the operators held among Atlanta's blue-collar workers, the strike received a considerable degree of support from the general public. In East Point, Georgia, a crowd of several hundred had formed to cheer as 16 cars were abandoned. Georgia Railway had prepared for the strike by assembling 30 men to take over, and within a few minutes of the strike's beginning, the streetcars in downtown were again running, though suburban routes, such as those in East Point and Fort McPherson, were not resumed. Following the commencement of the strike, large groups of spectators and strike supporters formed in downtown, with strikers yelling at passing streetcars and urging the operators to join the strike. While The Atlanta Constitution initially reported that the crowd's were \\"boisterously good-natured\\", the crowds became more restless as the strike carried on. Strikers began to shout at the replacement workers, calling them scabs and attempting to pull them from the streetcars and steal their badges and caps. By 10:30 pm, the company called all their streetcars to return to their carbarns, citing a lack of protection from the police. Within an hour of this, a federal judge in Atlanta issued a restraining order on two unions and several union leaders. As the dispute continued, incidents of violence regarding the strikes were reported. Around 9 pm, a streetcar stop was torched, and there were many reports of strikers greasing tracks and damaging streetcars. Dynamiting was reported in several cases, including an incident in which two women were severely injured. However, there is debate as to who was responsible for the incidents of dynamite. Several streetcar operators, interviewed years after the strike, alleged that the company had placed dynamite on several streetcars and blamed the union. On October 2, a group of prominent Atlanta citizens held a meeting at the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and formed a committee on law and order. This group, headed by an executive committee that had Coca-Cola Company founder Asa Griggs Candler as its chairman, collaborated with the police and county commissioners during the course of the strike. On October 3, the president of the newly created Amalgamated Association Local 732 released five points as the cause of the strike, which included long hours, low wages, mandatory membership in the company's benevolent society, expression of political opinions as grounds for firing, and claims that issues were caused by outside interference. That same month, strikers and strike supporters began operating jitneys in order to recuperate lost wages and put more pressure on the railway company. While Woodward had banned the strikers from addressing the public from public areas, such as the Henry W. Grady statue, on October 13, a pro-strike rally at the Municipal Auditorium was attended by approximately 8,500 people. Among these supporters were local members of the Socialist Party of America. In November, Warren Akin Candler, brother of Asa Candler and a Bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, banned the use of Methodist churches in the city for strike meetings. Prior to this, many pro-strike meetings were held in the city's Methodist churches. That same month, Pollard, who had been indicted for insurrection, was placed on trial. On December 6, his case ended with a mistrial. On January 5, 1917, the company agreed to a pay increase for the operators, but refused to rehire fired union members or recognize the union. While this ended the strike, tensions between the union and company remained high for several months afterwards regarding the lack of union recognition, and on July 16, 1918, another strike commenced. Lasting only four days, this subsequent strike ended with arbitration from the National War Labor Board and lead to the company agreeing to recognize the union.

Completely made out of concrete, it is located southwest of the city of Trujillo in Venezuela. At tall it is the 48th tallest statue in the world, the tallest statue in South America and the second-tallest in the Americas, the fourth-tallest statue depicting a woman in the world, and the tallest statue of Mary in the world. It is across, with a base that is deep, and weighs 1,200 tonnes. It was designed by the Spanish-Venezuelan sculptor Manuel de la Fuente and opened on 21 December 1983 by President Luis Herrera Campins. The monument stands at about above sea level, in the region named Pe√±a de la Virgen ‚Äî where it is said that the virgin appeared in the year 1570. From the monument there are spectacular panoramic views of the region: on a clear day, one can see all of the state of Trujillo, parts of the Sierra Nevada de M√©rida, and the south coast of Lake Maracaibo. Since 1568 the virgin of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz (Our Lady of Peace) has been the spiritual patron of Trujillo; since 1960 she has been the patron of this diocese, as well. The dove in the statue's right hand symbolizes the responsibility of the presidency of Venezuela to make peace across the land. For many years the statue was administered through a private foundation, before passing to the directorship of the government of the state of Trujillo. Despite its colossal size and the importance of its commemorative symbolism of the patron saint of the state, the monument is one of the least visited tourist spots in Trujillo and in Venezuela. In Easter 2010 the Trujillo government reported 11,000 visitors to the monument, while the Jos√© Gregorio Hern√°ndez sanctuary received close to 80,000 visits, and the traditional way of the cross in the town of Tost√≥s was visited by approximately 57,000 tourists. History The Trujillo area has been relevant in the Christian mysticism beliefs of the inhabitants of the lands around the monument since colonial times. The Virgin of Peace is the patron saint of the state of Trujillo, and the state flag has a green triangle, in its center a white star and inside the star the silhouette of a dove, a symbol of peace. The three sides of the triangle represent a triad of monuments, two of them religious: # The national monument of the Meeting of Bol√≠var and Morillo in Santa Ana, on the occasion of the Armistice Treaty and Regularization of War # The Cathedral Se√±or Santiago de Nuestra Se√±ora de La Paz, finished in 1662, and where the precious image of Our Lady of Peace was venerated in the 16th century. It is also on the coat of arms of the city and the state, and is where Bishop Lasso de La Vega welcomed Bol√≠var and entrusted him to divine providence on 1 March 1821 # The Monumento a la Virgen de la Paz, an appeal to world peace =Virgen de la Paz= The origins of the image of the Virgin of Peace probably dates back to the 7th century, associated with Saint Ildefonsus of Toledo (606-667), an archbishop of Toledo, Spain, noted for his devotion to the Virgin Mary. Tradition relates that on a December night, Ildefonsus entered the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a de Toledo and witnessed a great illumination inside the temple, purporting to see the Virgin sitting in the archbishop's chair, which has been interpreted as divine approval of Ildefonsus' teachings. The area of Trujillo where the monument is now erected was inhabited by an indigenous society known as Eskuke. It was the site of an indigenous uprising led by the Cacique Pitijoc, of the Cuicas ethnic group against the Spanish colonists.Trujillo: Dossier Municipal 2006. Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Planificaci√≥ny Desarrollo: CorpoAndes. The indigenous people were defeated, and Trujillo was founded in 1557, with the belief of the Virgin of Peace introduced to replace the indigenous goddess Ikake.El conquistador espa√±ol: los fundadores de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz de Trujillo Discurso de recepci√≥n del Dr. Mario Brice√±o Irragory como individuo de n√∫mero de la Academia Nacional de la Historia. Caracas, Editorial Sud-Am√©rica, 1930. =The legend= Monumento a la Virgen de la Paz The name of the monument, the place and the Virgin all refer to the legend of her appearance. On the hill called Pe√±a de la Virgen, according to legend from the late 1550s, the image of the Virgin Mary appeared to several residents of the town of Carmona. With unique features and a youthful spirit, the young woman appeared walking in the afternoons to buy candles for her hearth, and it was in a grocery store where some men asked her why she was alone; she answered that she was \\"not alone, but with God, the sun and the stars\\", Ver publicaci√≥n en issuu.com: p√°gina 21 or \\"children, don't forget that I walk with God, my protector\\". As they followed her, the locals saw her hide behind a rock that began to spark, discovering that she was not a mortal young woman but that she was the Virgin Mary. =Monumento a la Paz= The construction of the monument began as an idea of First Lady of Venezuela Betty Urdaneta de Herrera Campins, who was from Trujillo, and the state governor Dora Maldonado de Falc√≥n. On 21 December 1983, during the bicentennial year of the birth of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the Monumento a la Virgin de la Paz was inaugurated, with the liturgical blessing of the newly ordained cardinal Jos√© Al√≠ Lebr√∫n Moratinos. The statue shows the Virgin Mary in a blue robe, and its construction had lasted 18 months, carried out by the sculptor Manuel de la Fuente and the engineer Rosendo Camargo, with support of Juan Francisco Hern√°ndez. The monument sits on a steel structure, which includes the skeleton of the hollow concrete sculpture. It has a weight of 1,200 tonnes spread over 46 meters high, of which 8 tonnes is the weight of the head alone. The cost of the monument was 9 million bol√≠vares. Ver publicaci√≥n en issuu.com: p√°gina 21 Despite the fact that Pope John Paul II never visited Trujillo, the dedication of the monument was attended by the Venezuelan ambassador to the Holy See, Luciano Noguera Mora, and was accompanied by a television message from the Pope that was broadcast to the Venezuelan Catholic community. In the speech that the Trujillan writer Mario Brice√±o Perozo gave during the dedication of the monument, when referring to the tradition of going up to the Pe√±a de la Virgen, he said:Monumento a La Virgen de La Paz (en espa√±ol).

The patron fairs in honor of the Virgen de la Paz are held in Trujillo on 24 January, often lasting until 30 January. During the festivities, the monument is treated as one of the most religious places in the state, with masses and processions, as well as gastronomic, cultural and recreational fairs at the site; these often extend to La Plazuela and Isnot√∫. Dozens of parishioners also gather at the Pe√±a de la Virgen each year for Easter, praying in the attached church. The \\"Peace March\\", which takes place every year during Easter, starts early in the morning from the headquarters of the Catholic Seminary in the city of Trujillo and ends with a mass in the monument's chapel. Viewpoints View through one of the eyes of the monument. The monument fulfills the function of an extraordinary viewpoint: ascending inside the statue, using stairs that fill the entire interior of the statue, visitors can stop at each of the five viewpoints or lookouts: one for each cardinal direction, and a fifth from the statue's eyes. First lookout: located at the level of the Virgin's knee, 18 meters from the base, which is accessed by a mechanical elevator. From this height you can see the city of Trujillo. Second lookout: located in the left hand of the statue, 4 meters above the first lookout, you can see the city of Trujillo and its surroundings, including the Llanos de Monay, the Agua Viva reservoir, Betijoque, Motat√°n, and rural parts of Pampanito and Isnot√∫. It is accessible by wide steps. Third lookout: located in the right hand of the statue, 26 meters up. The Teta de Niquitao can be seen from this height, which at high is the highest point in the state of Trujillo. Fourth lookout: located at the waist level of the statue, at 28 meters high, which can also be reached by elevator. From here, more distant sights can be seen, including La Ceiba, the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, the ridges of the Sierra Nevada de M√©rida, various plains and much of the land from Trujillo to the state of Lara. Fifth lookout: located in the eyes of the Virgin, 44 meters high, this lookout the most extensive and impressive view. It is reached by more than 200 wide steps. In addition to the viewpoints, the monument consists of a chapel and a bell tower, which rings out every half hour. The dome of the chapel is decorated with a stained glass window. In the center of this, a dove appears surrounded by luminous colors that allude to the spiritual splendor of the symbol.Nota: v√©ase foto del vitral de la c√∫pula de la capilla Monumento a Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz en Art√≠sticaVitrales.com √öltimo acceso 18 de mayo de 2010. =Cave of the Virgin of Peace= Lower down the mountain than the Pe√±a de la Virgen, to one side of the monument, there is a group of publicly accessible caves collectively known as Cuevas de la Pe√±a de la Virgen II (Caves of the Pe√±a de la Virgen II). Local folklore says that the caves are interconnected and that the indigenous people of the past used them not only for their religious ceremonies but also to travel through the state. Other caves complexes nearby include the Cuevas de la Pe√±a de la Virgen I, Cueva El Zamurito and Cueva El Ronco. The movements of the Andes over the centuries will have closed whatever connected passageways were supposedly present. The followers of the Virgin frequently visit these caves, often in religious processions, and give offerings and candles at the site.

South Carolina briefly had a majority- black government during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, but with the 1876 inauguration of Governor Wade Hampton III, a Democrat who supported the disenfranchisement of blacks, African Americans in South Carolina struggled to exercise their rights. Poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation kept African Americans from voting, and it was virtually impossible for someone to challenge the Democratic Party, which ran unopposed in most state elections for decades. By 1940, the voter registration provisions written into the 1895 constitution effectively limited African- American voters to 3,000‚Äîonly 0.8 percent of those of voting age in the state. Jim Crow laws, legalized by the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), created a district color line across the South. African Americans were prohibited from using the same facilities as white Americans, and African- American children were prohibited from attending white schools; schools meant for colored children were typical of lower quality than white schools. Public segregation and voting restrictions were eventually reversed after the events of the civil rights movement in South Carolina and the United States during the 1950s and the 1960s.  Background  The passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution in the years following the Civil War provided for the enfranchisement of African Americans in South Carolina. During the Reconstruction era, South Carolinians elected a majority-black legislature. Additionally, several African Americans were elected to other higher offices, including Robert Smalls and Richard H. Cain to the U.S. House of Representatives, Alonzo J. Ransier and Richard Howell Gleaves as lieutenant governor, and Francis Lewis Cardozo as South Carolina's secretary of state. Largely, African Americans were free to vote during this period. However, as part of the Compromise of 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes removed the military occupation of the South, which allowed former Confederates and white supremacists to take power in South Carolina. During the 1876 gubernatorial election, African Americans were largely prevented from voting. Consequently, the incumbent Republican governor, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, lost reelection and Democrat Wade Hampton III took office. Chamberlain refused to leave office, claiming that the election was invalid because of African Americans' voting rights having been trampled. For a brief period, two governments were formed, but the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Hampton to be the lawful governor. Over the next decades, African Americans were kept from voting through literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation. The Democrat's retaking of power in 1876 allowed for the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, which sought to terrorize African Americans through lynchings and fear. The Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) Supreme Court decision further allowed for the legality of segregation in public facilities and schools that extended into the 1960s. Isaac Woodard, a World War II veteran, after having his eyes gouged out by a police officer in Batesburg- Leesville In 1944, George Stinney, a 14-year-old black youth, was accused of murdering two white girls, aged 11 and 8, near Alcolu in Clarendon County, South Carolina. Stinney was interrogated by police in a locked room with several white officers and no other witnesses, and it was asserted that he had confessed to the killing within an hour. Stinney's father was fired from his job at a local lumber mill, and his family had to either leave the town or risk lynching. Stinney was rapidly convicted mostly because he faced an all- white jury. Stinney's court-appointed attorney, Charles Plowden, was a tax commissioner with political aspirations, and historians have considered him to have been ineffective in counseling Stinney. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed at the South Carolina Penitentiary in Columbia. Seventy years later, historians still questioned whether he was guilty and doubted that he received a fair trial. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was overturned on the grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated, and his confession had most likely been coerced. In 1946, Isaac Woodard, an African-American World War II veteran, was attacked hours after being honorably discharged on a bus ride to North Carolina. Woodard and the bus driver argued about whether there was time to use the restroom before the bus departed. When the bus arrived in Batesburg-Leesville, the driver called the police. Woodard was forcibly removed for the bus and attacked by several white men, including the bus driver, several police officers, and Sheriff Lynwood Shull. Woodard was beaten with nightsticks and had his eyes gouged out. Woodard was left permanently blind. The incident sparked national outrage, encouraging President Harry S. Truman to order a federal investigation. The sheriff was indicted and went to trial in a federal court, but he was acquitted by an all- white jury. Such miscarriages of justice against African Americans, coupled with unfair discrimination laws, influenced South Carolina and the nation toward civil rights initiatives. Much of the civil rights movement in South Carolina was resolved without rioting or violence. African-American protesters were often arrested and sometimes mistreated by police, but protesters typically remained peaceful and nonviolent. Much of the national spotlight during the civil rights movement was focused on Alabama and Mississippi.  Education  Public schools = Booker T. Washington High School (Columbia, SC) A former black school in Rock Hill, South Carolina, commonly referred to as Rosenwald schools. These schools were typically small, dilapidated, and housed students from multiple ages. In 1951, Governor James F. Byrnes, supporting the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine required by the Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) decision, proposed a three percent sales tax increase to fund black schools. Byrnes sought to improve black schools to prevent desegregation, and these school improvements were often colloquially regarded to as \\"equalization schools\\". In 1952, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina heard the Briggs v. Elliott case, which argued that unequal schools caused by segregation in Summerton violated African- American children's Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. The court ultimately ruled that unequal schools were unconstitutional, but stopped short of requiring schools to integrate. The court in the case of Briggs v. Elliot delivered a verdict that was almost identical to Plessy v. Ferguson in that it provided for legalized segregated facilities based on race so long as the separate facilities were equal. The families of the African- American children in Summerton appealed, and Briggs v. Elliot was the first of five cases to be combined into Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which required the desegregation of schools nationwide. By 1964, South Carolina's 37 Roman Catholic schools desegregated. Desegregation of public schools began in August of 1964, though some schools were still segregated into the early 1970s. Charleston County School District began desegregating in 1963 and was among the earliest to integrate, though the district was still largely segregated. While the district was no longer legally segregated, only 11 black students attended a white school in the first year. The district did not integrate on a large scale until the early 1970s. Many pro-segregationists supported segregation academies. Between 1963 and 1975, in an extension of white flight, over 200 of these academies were established to keep schools all-white. In 1978, private school enrollment reached a peak of 50,000. In Clarendon County, for example, the private academy Clarendon Hall was established in late 1965 after four black students enrolled in a previously all-white public school. By 1969, only 281 white students were left in the public school system, and only 16 white students were in public schools when they officially desegregated a year later. = Colleges and universities = Harvey Gantt was the first African-American student enrolled at Clemson University. He later became the Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. In January 1963, Harvey Gantt became the first black student to attend Clemson University by order of Federal District Judge Charles Cecil Wyche. On May 20, 1963, over 1,000 students at the University of South Carolina protested integration. They marched to the State House chanting \\"We don't want to integrate\\". On the campus' Horseshoe, a cross was burned in opposition to the enrollment of African-American students. In September 1963, the University of South Carolina admitted three African-American students by court order: Robert G. Anderson, Henrie Monteith Treadwell and James L. Solomon Jr. Both Clemson and South Carolina desegregated without much resistance. The College of Charleston refused to abide by the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and continued to refuse to enroll in African-American students. In July 1965, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare revoked the ability of students at the college to receive federal loans as long as the college was not integrated. In 1967, the College of Charleston enrolled its first black students.  Role of historically black colleges and universities in leading protests and boycotts  Beginning in February 1960, students at Allen University and Benedict College, two colleges in Columbia, began planning protests against segregation laws. On March 2, approximately fifty students from the two schools participated in lunch counter sit-ins, forcing the businesses to close for the day. The following day, five hundred students gathered to protest, two hundred of whom marched to the city center and the State House. On March 4, several white men burned a cross on the property of Allen University and threw bricks at one of the school buildings in retaliation to the protests. Some black students retorted by breaking car windows at a white drive-in restaurant, an event which the leaders of the student protests condemned. In response, the Mayor of Columbia announced that any person caught protesting would be arrested. Students from Allen and Benedict often met at campus locations or in nearby black churches. Students created flyers and other forms of advertisement to gather support for the civil rights cause. On March 5, students from Claflin University and South Carolina State University, two colleges in Orangeburg, formed the South Carolina Student Movement Association (SCSM). The association's goal was to create collaboration among all South Carolina black schools to bring about integration by protesting stores and businesses with discriminatory policies. On March 15, the SCSM held simultaneous protests in Orangeburg, Columbia, and Rock Hill, resulting in the arrest of 11 students in Columbia. In Orangeburg, approximately 1,000 students nonviolently protested in the business district, resulting in the arrests of 388 students. Police used fire hoses and tear gas to halt the protest, but the students refused to act violently. Not having enough room in the county jail, some jailed students were house in stockades originally built for cattle; they were subjected to 40-degree rainy weather. Throughout the summer, the SCSM organized small-scale protests but had difficulty organizing large events. Reverend Isaiah DeQuincey Newman led a group of protesters on a four-mile march to the Columbia municipal airport to protest segregated waiting rooms. A few days later, he led students on a march to Sesquicentennial State Park to protest the all-white policy of the park. On October 15, students at Allen University and Benedict College formed the Student Committee for Human Rights to facilitate citywide organization. On March 2, 1961, exactly one year after the initial protest in Columbia, the Greenville chapter of the NAACP organized a large-scale protest at the South Carolina State House. Over 200 students protested nonviolently and sang religious hymns. State police ordered the protesters to leave, but students refused. 187 of the 200 were arrested and found guilty of \\"disturbing the peace\\", though this verdict was overruled in the Supreme Court case Edwards v. South Carolina (1962). Among those arrested were Reverend Newman and future U.S. Congressman and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. On March 5, Benedict College student, Lennie Glover, was stabbed at a sit-in at F. W. Woolworth's in Columbia. In response to the stabbing, students led a protest on March 24, the week before Easter, named the \\"Easter Lennie Glover No Buying Campaign\\", which called for daily picketing and boycotting of businesses with discriminatory practices. Most businesses and facilities protested by HBCU students were desegregated within four years.  Protests and desegregation of public facilities  From the end of the Reconstruction era until the end civil rights movement, almost every business and public facility across the state was segregated both by custom and by law. For example, a business owner could be fined in the City of Greenville for serving a white and colored person at the same table. The city ordinance is cited below: Nearly every town and cities had segregation laws, ranging from daily shopping businesses and restaurants to public transportation buses, movie theaters, airports, libraries, public parks, swimming pools, restrooms, drinking fountains, and doctors' offices. = Columbia bus system = On June 22, 1954, Sarah Mae Flemming sat in the whites-only section of a city bus in Columbia. The bus driver immediately instructed Flemming to stand and wait for a colored seat to become available. Flemming, still two miles from her destination, attempted to exit the bus at the next stop, but the driver blocked the exit and physically assaulted her. Flemming was not arrested, but she did visit the hospital because of the assault. The following week, Modjeska Monteith Simkins heard about Flemming's encounter and hired a lawyer to file a suit against South Carolina Electric and Gas, the owner of the bus. Flemming's lawyer argued that her Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated and demanded for $25,000 in punitive damages. Lower courts ruled in the bus company's favor, but after Flemming's lawyer filed the case in a federal suit in the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, Flemming won the suit and the court ruled the bus segregation to be unconstitutional, though the court added that bus company did not owe Flemming any money. At the time, the case received little publicity. = New Year's Day March = In October 1959, Major League Baseball player Jackie Robinson entered the whites-only waiting room at the Greenville Municipal Airport. Airport police asked Robinson to leave, but he refused. Ultimately, the police did not force Robinson to move. At a NAACP speech in Greenville, Robinson urged \\"complete freedom\\" and encouraged black citizens to vote and to protest their second-class citizenship. The following January on New Year's Day, approximately 1,000 staged a march to the airport, which was desegregated shortly thereafter. = Friendship Nine = In 1961, a group of nine African- American men was arrested for staging a sit-in at a segregated McCrory's lunch counter in Rock Hill. The group gained national attention and sparked many other sit-ins across the nation. A major goal of these \\"Jail, No Bail\\" protests was to strain the prison system and force integration. The group became known as the \\"Friendship Nine\\". = Greenville Eight = Jesse Jackson of Greenville, SC, led many civil rights campaigns in South Carolina Public libraries in Columbia and Spartanburg desegregated without controversy. In Greenville, however, on July 16, 1960, eight African-American students protested the segregation practices of the Greenville County public library. The county library had white-only and colored-only branches. The colored branch was a one-room house that had fewer books than the white-only branch. The students entered the white branch of the library. Some selected a book and sat down to read while others browsed the shelves. Several white patrons left the library. The librarian asked the students to leave, but they remain silent and refused to move. When the police arrived, the eight students were arrested, then released on a $30 bond. On July 28, Donald J. Sampson, the students' lawyer, filed a suit against the library system. On September 2, the mayor and the city council instructed the library to close to avoid forced integration. Greenville Mayor J. Kenneth Cass said, \\"The efforts being made by a few Negroes to use the White library will now deprive all White and Negro citizens of the benefit of a library.\\" Public pressure encouraged Cass to reopen the library system, but he refused to integrate the facility, stating libraries \\"will not be used for demonstrations, purposeless assembly, or propaganda purposes.\\" But the library desegregated short thereafter, and the charges against the eight students were dropped. = Peterson v. City of Greenville (1962) = In 1962, ten African-American petitioners in Greenville entered and seated themselves at a lunch counter reserved for whites. The manager called for police, and when the protesters refused to move, they were arrested and taken to the police headquarters. The ten protesters were charged with \\"trespassing\\". The case was heard in a federal court in the case Peterson v. City of Greenville (1962). The court ruled in favor of the protesters, stating that the city's segregation law was a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right. = Orangeburg massacre = On February 8, 1963, in Orangeburg, three South Carolina State University students were killed and dozens wounded after 200 students protested racial segregation at a local bowling alley. The students were fired upon by highway patrolmen in an event that became known as the Orangeburg massacre. In response to the shooting, South Carolina State University students protested at the State House in March. = South Carolina public parks and entertainment venues = The U.S. District Court case Brown v. South Carolina State Forestry Commission (1963) ruled that all public parks must desegregate. Instead, the Forrestry Commission closed all parks, refusing to open. Parks reopened on a restricted basis in June 1964, nearly a year later, then fully in July 1964. In December 1963, five movie theaters in Columbia agree to admit one black couple daily, announcing they would fully desegregate by the end of January 1964. In the winter of 1961, eight black men and women were arrested for attempting to use an all-white skating rink and swimming pool in Greenville's Cleveland Park. In 1962, a federal court ruled that the segregation of the park facilities was unconstitutional. Rather than integrating, the city closed the park and the rink permanently; the pool was converted into a \\"Marineland\\" with three sea lions. In 1973, the South Carolina State Fair fully integrated. = Charleston hospital strike = On March 17, 1969, a group of 300 African-American women healthcare workers at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston protested unequal pay and unsafe working conditions. Coretta Scott King, the widowed wife of Martin Luther King Jr., was among the protesting women, and this was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's first major campaign since King's assassination. Several women took control of the hospital president's office while singing hymns and chanting. Most women returned to their jobs once Police Chief John Conroy threatened to arrest the protesters, but twelve women were fired for abandoning their patients. After the firing of the twelve women, many more employees, predominantly women, went on strike. The strike lasted over 100 days, and in late April, National Guard troops with tanks, gas masks, and bayonet-fixed rifles arrive to confront the healthcare workers. The strike ended, without violence, in June with a settlement.  Opposition  In 1956, U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina authored the Southern Manifesto, which denounced the 1954 Brown v. Board decision as \\"unwarranted\\" and referred to anti-segregationists as \\"agitators and troublemakers invading our States\\". Many schools and districts, consequentially, refused to integrate as mandated by the Supreme Court. The manifesto encouraged white flight, school choice, and the voluntary closing of public schools. Governor Fritz Hollings (1959‚Äì1963), initially opposed integration but reversed his position midway through his gubernatorial term. Hollings advocated for school integration \\"with dignity\\", and he stated that the age of segregation had passed. Hollings was the first governor of South Carolina to support integration since the Reconstruction era in the 1870s. The Virginia battle flag, commonly referred to as the Confederate flag, was raised over the SC State House in 1962 during the civil rights movement In 1962, the South Carolina General Assembly voted to display the Virginia battle flag on top of the State House dome. The flag flew on the dome until 2000, where it was moved to a monument on the capitol grounds. The flag was removed from the grounds in 2015 after the Charleston church shooting. After the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, the state of South Carolina argued that the act was unconstitutional and that states reserved the right to regulate and control elections. In the Supreme Court decision of South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), Justice Earl Warren authored in the majority opinion that preventing racial discrimination was a \\"legitimate response\\" of Congress and that South Carolina's intentions were generated from \\"insidious and pervasive evil\\". 200pxIn 1967 Sterling High School, an all-black school in Greenville, was destroyed by fire. Many believed that the fire was intentional, especially since the same week the school had approved for renovations, but this claim was never proven. Throughout the early 1960s, students at Sterling protested unequal treatment in Greenville, especially at F. W. Woolworth's, through nonviolent protests and sit-ins. In 2006 a memorial to these students was constructed in Greenville on the location of the former Woolworth's. On January 25, 1972, the Springfield Baptist Church in Greenville, a black church, was burned in opposition to African-American equality. The church, founded by former slaves in 1867, was one of few places African Americans could safely visit during the era of Jim Crow. The church had been a site for many speakers and leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson. The church had been a location for many NAACP meetings during the civil rights movement, and it had been where many peaceful protests were planned, including the New Year's Day March that resulted in the desegregation of the Greenville‚ÄìSpartanburg International Airport.  National leaders  On April 17, 1963, Malcolm X delivered a speech at a mosque in Columbia, denouncing the political leaders. On April 25, 1963, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother to President John F. Kennedy, spoke at the University of South Carolina, stating that \\"the practical needs of the world today would compel our national government...to do everything possible to eliminate racial discrimination.\\" In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Charleston where he encouraged African Americans to vote and protest racial inequality. Notable leaders include: *Modjeska Monteith Simkins *Isaiah DeQuincey Newman *Matthew J. Perry *Septima Poinsette Clark *Jesse Jackson *Charlayne Hunter- Gault *Leola C. Robinson-Simpson  Legacy  The passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to the creation of the Legislative Black Caucus in the South Carolina legislature. For the first time since the Reconstruction era, African Americans were elected to political offices in South Carolina. By the end of the 1960s, few African Americans were elected to office. As of 2020, 44 of 172 members of the South Carolina General Assembly were African American, accounting for about 26%.

It was built in around 1560 by Dragut on the site of a Hospitaller church, parts of which were incorporated into the mosque. The mosque was damaged in World War II but it was subsequently repaired, although the reconstruction was not completely faithful to its original design. History Late 19th century illustration of the mosque The Sidi Darghut Mosque was built around 1560 by the Ottoman governor Dragut, shortly after the 1551 recapture of Tripoli from the Knights Hospitaller. The site of the mosque was formerly occupied by the Hospitaller church or chapel. The church had survived the 1551 siege, and Dragut personally chose this site to build his mosque. According to local tradition, the church building was retained intact and incorporated into the mosque. After Dragut was killed whilst attacking the Hospitallers in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, his body was taken to Tripoli and buried in the mosque. A number of alterations were carried out to the mosque by Iskander Pasha in the early 1600s, including the remodelling of the minaret and the construction of a hammam (or at least the renovation of an existing one). The Superintendence of Monuments and Excavations made an accurate survey of the site in 1921. The building was restored in the 1920s, but it was hit by bombardment in World War II and the central part of the building (which had been the church) was severely damaged. Reconstruction works were undertaken by Ali Mohamed Abu Zaian, but the rebuilt mosque contains a number of differences from the original building. Armed men attempted to vandalise the mosque several times during the 2014 violence in Libya but were repelled. Architecture The Sidi Darghut Mosque was the first Ottoman style mosque to be built in Tripoli. The building has a T-shaped prayer hall, with a plan bearing some similarities to mosques found in Anatolia. The Hospitaller church was a small rectangular building with timber beams supporting a flat roof, and when it was converted into a mosque new wings were added on either side of the original building. The mosque is set within a trapezoidal enclosure which includes other facilities including a cemetery. The prayer hall has a roof which originally consisted of 27 small cupolas (32 after the postwar reconstruction). This element is typical of traditional Libyan architecture, and it later became a common element in mosques built in the area. The mosque includes two mihrabs, and a number of tombs including that of Dragut and his family are found near one of them. The mosque also includes a fountain for ablution (known as a midha) and a minaret which was remodelled by Iskander Pasha in 1602.

All species are found in the Southern Hemisphere. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed in 2017 to accommodate a clade of Southern Hemisphere species formerly placed in genus Melanelixia. Although they were not included in the original circumscription of Melanelixia, they were later added by virtue of their sister-group relationship to other Melanelixia species. Austromelanelixia appears to have been accepted as a valid genus by later lichenologists and has been included in recent updates of fungal classification. Description Austromelanelixia species have a foliose thallus with an upper surface that ranges in colour from olive-green to dark brown. There is often hyaline cortical hairs on lobe apices or isidial tip, and it is spotted or stained (maculate) particularly on the margins of the lobes. Pseudocyphellae are not present. The upper cortex is covered by a pored (fenestrate) epicortex. Ascospores are ellipsoid, colourless, simple, with dimensions of 10‚Äì18 by 7‚Äì10 Œºm.

They are instrumental in DNA demethylation. 5-Methylcytosine (see first Figure) is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine (C) that often regulates gene transcription and has several other functions in the genome. DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA that happens at cytosine. The image shows a cytosine single ring base and a methyl group added on to the 5 carbon. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at a cytosine that is followed by a guanine. Demethylation by TET enzymes (see second Figure), can alter the regulation of transcription. The TET enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and can further catalyse oxidation of 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and then to 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). 5fC and 5caC can be removed from the DNA base sequence by base excision repair and replaced by cytosine in the base sequence. alt= TET enzymes have central roles in DNA demethylation required during embryogenesis, gametogenesis, memory, learning, addiction and pain perception. TET proteins The three related TET genes, TET1, TET2 and TET3 code respectively for three related mammalian proteins TET1, TET2, and TET3. All three proteins possess 5mC oxidase activity, but they differ in terms of domain architecture. TET proteins are large (‚àº180- to 230-kDa) multidomain enzymes. All TET proteins contain a conserved double- stranded Œ≤-helix (DSBH) domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and binding sites for the cofactors Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) that together form the core catalytic region in the C terminus. In addition to their catalytic domain, full-length TET1 and TET3 proteins have an N-terminal CXXC zinc finger domain that can bind DNA. The TET2 protein lacks a CXXC domain, but the IDAX gene, that's a neighbor of the TET2 gene, encodes a CXXC4 protein. IDAX is thought to play a role in regulating TET2 activity by facilitating its recruitment to unmethylated CpGs. =TET isoforms= The three TET genes are expressed as different isoforms, including at least two isoforms of TET1, three of TET2 and three of TET3. Different isoforms of the TET genes are expressed in different cells and tissues. The full-length canonical TET1 isoform appears virtually restricted to early embryos, embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs). The dominant TET1 isoform in most somatic tissues, at least in the mouse, arises from alternative promoter usage which gives rise to a short transcript and a truncated protein designated TET1s. The three isoforms of TET2 arise from different promoters. They are expressed and active in embryogenesis and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The isoforms of TET3 are the full length form TET3FL, a short form splice variant TET3s, and a form that occurs in oocytes designated TET3o. TET3o is created by alternative promoter use and contains an additional first N-terminal exon coding for 11 amino acids. TET3o only occurs in oocytes and the one cell stage of the zygote and is not expressed in embryonic stem cells or in any other cell type or adult mouse tissue tested. Whereas TET1 expression can barely be detected in oocytes and zygotes, and TET2 is only moderately expressed, the TET3 variant TET3o shows extremely high levels of expression in oocytes and zygotes, but is nearly absent at the 2-cell stage. It appears that TET3o, high in oocytes and zygotes at the one cell stage, is the major TET enzyme utilized when almost 100% rapid demethylation occurs in the paternal genome just after fertilization and before DNA replication begins (see DNA demethylation). =TET specificity= Many different proteins bind to particular TET enzymes and recruit the TETs to specific genomic locations. In some studies, further analysis is needed to determine whether the interaction per se mediates the recruitment or instead the interacting partner helps to establish a favourable chromatin environment for TET binding. TET1‚Äëdepleted and TET2‚Äëdepleted cells revealed distinct target preferences of these two enzymes, with TET1‚Äëpreferring promoters and TET2‚Äëpreferring gene bodies of highly expressed genes and enhancers. Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site The three mammalian DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) show a strong preference for adding a methyl group to the 5 carbon of a cytosine where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5' ‚Üí 3' direction (at CpG sites). This forms a 5mCpG site. More than 98% of DNA methylation occurs at CpG sites in mammalian somatic cells. Thus TET enzymes largely initiate demethylation at 5mCpG sites. Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is one example of a protein that recruits a TET enzyme. TET1 is able to act on 5mCpG if an ROS has first acted on the guanine to form 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG or its tautomer 8-oxo-dG), resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide (see Figure). After formation of 5mCp-8-OHdG, the base excision repair enzyme OGG1 binds to the 8-OHdG lesion without immediate excision (see Figure). Adherence of OGG1 to the 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1, allowing TET1 to oxidize the 5mC adjacent to 8-OHdG. This initiates the demethylation pathway. =TET processivity= TET processivity can be viewed at three levels, the physical, chemical and genetic levels. Physical processivity refers to the ability of a TET protein to slide along the DNA from one CpG site to another. An in vitro study showed that DNA-bound TET does not preferentially oxidize other CpG sites on the same DNA molecule, indicating that TET is not physically processive. Chemical processivity refers to the ability of TET to catalyze the oxidation of 5mC iteratively to 5caC without releasing its substrate. It appears that TET can work through both chemically processive and non‚Äëprocessive mechanisms depending on reaction conditions. Genetic processivity refers to the genetic outcome of TET‚Äëmediated oxidation in the genome, as shown by mapping of the oxidized bases. In mouse embryonic stem cells, many genomic regions or CpG sites are modified so that 5mC is changed to 5hmC but not to 5fC or 5caC, whereas at many otherCpG sites 5mCs are modified to 5fC or 5caC but not 5hmC, suggesting that 5mC is processed to different states at different genomic regions or CpG sites. =TET enzyme activity= The conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by TET enzyme plus a-ketoglutarate & Fe(II) TET enzymes are dioxygenases in the family of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. A TET enzyme is an alpha-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG) dependent dioxygenase that catalyses an oxidation reaction by incorporating a single oxygen atom from molecular oxygen (O2) into its substrate, 5-methylcytosine in DNA (5mC), to produce the product 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA. This conversion is coupled with the oxidation of the co-substrate Œ±-KG to succinate and carbon dioxide (see Figure). The first step involves the binding of Œ±-KG and 5-methylcytosine to the TET enzyme active site. The TET enzymes each harbor a core catalytic domain with a double-stranded Œ≤-helix fold that contains the crucial metal-binding residues found in the family of Fe(II)/Œ±-KG- dependent oxygenases. Œ±-KG coordinates as a bidentate ligand (connected at two points) to Fe(II) (see Figure), while the 5mC is held by a noncovalent force in close proximity. The TET active site contains a highly conserved triad motif, in which the catalytically-essential Fe(II) is held by two histidine residues and one aspartic acid residue (see Figure). The triad binds to one face of the Fe center, leaving three labile sites available for binding Œ±-KG and O2 (see Figure). TET then acts to convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine while Œ±-ketoglutarate is converted to succinate and CO2. =Alternate TET activities= The TET proteins also have activities that are independent of DNA demethylation. These include, for instance, TET2 interaction with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase to promote histone O-GlcN acylation to affect transcription of target genes. TET functionsEarly embryogenesis= Methylation levels during mouse early embryonic development. The mouse sperm genome is 80‚Äì90% methylated at its CpG sites in DNA, amounting to about 20 million methylated sites. After fertilization, early in the first day of embryogenesis, the paternal chromosomes are almost completely demethylated in six hours by an active TET- dependent process, before DNA replication begins (blue line in Figure). Demethylation of the maternal genome occurs by a different process. In the mature oocyte, about 40% of its CpG sites in DNA are methylated. In the pre- implantation embryo up to the blastocyst stage (see Figure), the only methyltransferase present is an isoform of DNMT1 designated DNMT1o. It appears that demethylation of the maternal chromosomes largely takes place by blockage of the methylating enzyme DNMT1o from entering the nucleus except briefly at the 8 cell stage (see DNA demethylation). The maternal-origin DNA thus undergoes passive demethylation by dilution of the methylated maternal DNA during replication (red line in Figure). The morula (at the 16 cell stage), has only a small amount of DNA methylation (black line in Figure). =Gametogenesis= The newly formed primordial germ cells (PGC) in the implanted embryo devolve from the somatic cells at about day 7 of embryogenesis in the mouse. At this point the PGCs have high levels of methylation. These cells migrate from the epiblast toward the gonadal ridge. As reviewed by Messerschmidt et al., the majority of PGCs are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle while they migrate toward the hindgut during embryo days 7.5 to 8.5. Then demethylation of the PGCs takes place in two waves. There is both passive and active, TET-dependent demethylation of the primordial germ cells. At day 9.5 the primordial germ cells begin to rapidly replicate going from about 200 PGCs at embryo day 9.5 to about 10,000 PGCs at day 12.5. During days 9.5 to 12.5 DNMT3a and DNMT3b are repressed and DNMT1 is present in the nucleus at a high level. But DNMT1 is unable to methylate cytosines during days 9.5 to 12.5 because the UHRF1 gene (also known as NP95) is repressed and UHRF1 is an essential protein needed to recruit DNMT1 to replication foci where maintenance DNA methylation takes place. This is a passive, dilution form of demethylation. In addition, from embryo day 9.5 to 13.5 there is an active form of demethylation. As indicated in the Figure of the demethylation pathway above, two enzymes are central to active demethylation. These are a ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG). One particular TET enzyme, TET1, and TDG are present at high levels from embryo day 9.5 to 13.5, and are employed in active TET-dependent demethylation during gametogenesis. PGC genomes display the lowest levels of DNA methylation of any cells in the entire life cycle of the mouse by embryonic day 13.5. =Learning and Memory= Brain regions involved in memory formation Learning and memory have levels of permanence, differing from other mental processes such as thought, language, and consciousness, which are temporary in nature. Learning and memory can be either accumulated slowly (multiplication tables) or rapidly (touching a hot stove), but once attained, can be recalled into conscious use for a long time. Rats subjected to one instance of contextual fear conditioning create an especially strong long-term memory. At 24 hours after training, 9.17% of the genes in the genomes of rat hippocampus neurons were found to be differentially methylated. This included more than 2,000 differentially methylated genes at 24 hours after training, with over 500 genes being demethylated. Similar results to that in the rat hippocampus were also obtained in mice with contextual fear conditioning. The hippocampus region of the brain is where contextual fear memories are first stored (see Figure), but this storage is transient and does not remain in the hippocampus. In rats contextual fear conditioning is abolished when the hippocampus is subjected to hippocampectomy just one day after conditioning, but rats retain a considerable amount of contextual fear when hippocampectomy is delayed by four weeks. In mice, examined at 4 weeks after conditioning, the hippocampus methylations and demethylations were reversed (the hippocampus is needed to form memories but memories are not stored there) while substantial differential CpG methylation and demethylation occurred in cortical neurons during memory maintenance. There were 1,223 differentially methylated genes in the anterior cingulate cortex (see Figure) of mice four weeks after contextual fear conditioning. Thus, while there were many methylations in the hippocampus shortly after memory was formed, all these hippocampus methylations were demethylated as soon as four weeks later. Li et al. reported one example of the relationship between expression of a TET protein, demethylation and memory while using extinction training. Extinction training is the disappearance of a previously learned behavior when the behavior is not reinforced. A comparison between infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC) neuron samples derived from mice trained to fear an auditory cue and extinction-trained mice revealed dramatic experience-dependent genome-wide differences in the accumulation of 5-hmC in the ILPFC in response to learning. Extinction training led to a significant increase in TET3 messenger RNA levels within cortical neurons. TET3 was selectively activated within the adult neo-cortex in an experience-dependent manner. A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is an artificial RNA molecule with a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference. Mice trained in the presence of TET3-targeted shRNA showed a significant impairment in fear extinction memory. =Addiction= . Brain structures connected to addiction The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has a significant role in addiction. In the nucleus accumbens of mice, repeated cocaine exposure resulted in reduced TET1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and reduced TET1 protein expression. Similarly, there was a ~40% decrease in TET1 mRNA in the NAc of human cocaine addicts examined postmortem. As indicated above in learning and memory, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is an artificial RNA molecule with a tight hairpin turn that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference. Feng et al. injected shRNA targeted to TET1 in the NAc of mice. This could reduce TET1 expression in the same manner as reduction of TET1 expression with cocaine exposure. They then used an indirect measure of addiction, conditioned place preference. Conditioned place preference can measure the amount of time an animal spends in an area that has been associated with cocaine exposure, and this can indicate an addiction to cocaine. Reduced Tet1 expression caused by shRNA injected into the NAc robustly enhanced cocaine place conditioning. =Pain (Nociception)= As described in the article Nociception, nociception is the sensory nervous system's response to harmful stimuli, such as a toxic chemical applied to a tissue. In nociception, chemical stimulation of sensory nerve cells called nociceptors produces a signal that travels along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral responses and usually results in a subjective experience, or perception, of pain. Work by Pan et al. first showed that TET1 and TET3 proteins are normally present in the spinal cords of mice. They used a pain inducing model of intra plantar injection of 5% formalin into the dorsal surface of the mouse hindpaw and measured time of licking of the hindpaw as a measure of induced pain. Protein expression of TET1 and TET3 increased by 152% and 160%, respectively, by 2 hours after formalin injection. Forced reduction of expression of TET1 or TET3 by spinal injection of Tet1-siRNA or Tet3-siRNA for three consecutive days before formalin injection alleviated the mouse perception of pain. On the other hand, forced overexpression of TET1 or TET3 for 2 consecutive days significantly produced pain-like behavior as evidenced by a decrease in the mouse of the thermal pain threshold. They further showed that the nociceptive pain effects occurred through TET mediated conversion of 5-methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine in the promoter of a microRNA designated miR-365-3p, thus increasing its expression. This microRNA, in turn, ordinarily targets (decreases expression of) the messenger RNA of Kcnh2, that codes for a protein known as Kv11.1 or KCNH2. KCNH2 is the alpha subunit of a potassium ion channel in the central nervous system. Forced decrease in expression of TET1 or TET3 through pre-injection of siRNA reversed the decrease of KCNH2 protein in formalin-treated mice.

Lahr and Ghostley were both nominated for Tony Awards for their performances. In subsequent years, the play's commercial failure has been attributed to high production costs, mismanagement, and the fact that Perelman's dialogue, \\"steeped in syntactical invention and idiomatic Yiddish,\\" may have been more suited to the page.Hampton, Wilborn. \\"Perelman Aims a Shotgun at Society's Varied Foibles,\\" The New York Times 11 Oct. 1999.

Plot A group of evil wizards plot to enslave the entire world, but are repeatedly stopped by Karn the Barbarian. The league of wizards forge a magic sword named Deathbringer to kill him; they perform a sacrifical ritual, summoning a demon and imbuing their soul into the sword. Karn takes the sword for himself, turning it against them. The demon that inhabits Deathbringer needs souls to stay alive; Karn must feed souls to the sword by killing monsters, and he ultimately seeks to defeat the wizards. Gameplay The player takes the role of Karn the Barbarian who wields the eponymous sword Deathbringer, and seeks to defeat a group of evil wizards. Deathbringer has nonlinear map design: the player starts in the middle of each given level, and may move left or right to progress towards the boss. Upon reaching an exit to the level, they fight the boss; defeating them allows the player to progress to the next level, and the game has a total of 30 levels. Deathbringer has a time limit for each level in the form of the sword Deathbringer; the player must constantly kill monsters to obtain their souls, and refill a meter at the bottom of the screen that gradually decreases over time. If this meter reaches zero, it drains the player's health, ultimately killing them. When the sword's soul meter gets low, the player may lose control of their character, due to the sword taking control. Deathbringer has 36 levels of parallax scrolling, and its graphics received polarized reviews from critics. Development The Amiga version of Deathbringer was developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises and published by Empire. The Amiga version of Deathbringer began development in February 1991, and was released in September 1991. In a September 1991 issue of British gaming magazine The One, The One previewed Deathbringer's development. Each of Deathbringer's levels has backgrounds with 36 levels of parallax scrolling, which was achieved through using wedge-shaped tiles as opposed to square ones. As the player moves left or right, the wedge moves in the respective direction, giving the parallax effect. In Deathbringer's cave level, these 36 segments are instead curved, giving the cave walls a tubular effect. Deathbringer's graphics were originally created out-of-house by Colin Swinbourne, a freelance graphic designer, and Swinbourne's art was then adapted into sprites in Deluxe Paint III. Deathbringer initially had placeholder sound effects made by the Oxford Digital team themselves, but the sound effects in the final version were produced by Skinnybone Productions, and has 'over 116' 57Khz sampled sounds. In indoor levels, reverb was added to give the illusion of an echo. Due to the number of sound effects in Deathbringer, the game has only one music track. Deathbringer's music was produced out-of-house by Angus Murray, who was chosen after submitting a demo tape to Oxford Digital. The DOS version of Deathbringer was stated to cost 'around 90' Deutschmark in 1992, and the Amiga version was stated to cost 'around 79' Deutschmark. The Amiga version of Deathbringer was released on two floppy disks. Reception ST Format gave the Atari ST version of Deathbringer an overall score of 72%, noting the game's graphics as its strongest feature, stating that it \\"uses so many levels of parallax the effect looks almost perfect.\\" ST Format criticizes the game as 'priorizing looks over function' however, expressing that \\"it looks as if the programmers have spent the time getting the parallax right without thinking about the game itself.\\" ST Format criticized Deathbringer's gameplay as repetitive, summarizing it as \\"a matter of moving towards the next [level], killing numerous creatures on the way\\", expressing that the difficulty of the monsters and the landscapes are \\"about the only things that change\\", further stating that 'it doesn't have much to it'. German gaming magazine Power Play gave the DOS version of Deathbringer an overall score of 61%, praising its \\"fantastic\\" music, \\"fast\\" parallax scrolling and \\"bright & colorful\\" graphics, but criticized its 'unoriginal' gameplay. Power Play further stated that Deathbringer's style of gameplay \\"has been around for five years\\", further criticizing its 'limited' array of enemies, and summarizing its style of play as having \\"less strategy and more button mashing.\\" Power Play praised Deathbringer as 'technically sound', and called its soul meter mechanic \\"a great idea\\". German gaming magazine Amiga Joker gave the Amiga version of Deathbringer an overall score of 37%, criticizing it was 'short' and 'unsubstantial', stating that \\"there's not much to see\\". Amiga Joker criticized Deathbringer's graphics, calling its parallax scrolling \\"shaky\\", expressed that the game 'gets less and less colorful' as the game goes on, and stated that \\"unfortunately only the animation of the sprites turned out nice.\\" Amiga Joker criticized Deathbringer's sound, lamenting the game's single music track, and called the game's sound effects \\"nerve-killing\\", overall summarizing the game as \\"an economy version of Beast II.\\" German gaming magazine PC Joker gave the DOS version of Deathbringer an overall score of 41%, comparing it to Wrath of the Demon, expressing that it has 'similar shortcomings' due to the game 'prioritizing graphics over gameplay'. PC Joker criticized Deathbringer's gameplay and controls as \\"tedious\\", expressing that combat is 'a matter of luck as opposed to strategy' due to its \\"sluggish\\" controls. PC Joker further criticized Deathbringer's \\"simple\\" gameplay, expressing that \\"the pause function, endless continues and amount of patience required make the game pass by too fast\\", and furthermore said that Deathbringer is 'unsubstantial', stating that \\"there's nowhere near enough [content] to be anything more than a very average game\\". PC Joker criticized Deathbringer's graphics, stating that while its bosses are \\"impressive\\" and some of its sprites are \\"well animated\\", everything else is \\"simple\\". PC Joker also criticized Deathbringer's level design, expressing that they primarily differ by the \\"degree of their colorlessness\\". The One for ST Games gave the Atari ST version of Deathbringer an overall score of 80%, but criticized it's unoriginality. The One praised its \\"superb\\" graphics as its strongest feature, calling its parallax scrolling \\"one of the best seen on the ST\\", and its sprites and backgrounds \\"extremely detailed\\". The One criticized Deathbringer's difficulty, expressing that the game's bosses are \\"almost impossible\\" until the player figures out their pattern, at which point they're \\"too easy\\". The One praised Deathbringer's soul meter mechanics, as well as its nonlinear map design, comparing it to Out Run, but criticized the lack of visual damage when fighting opponents as 'unatmospheric'.

Taken from Ref. [1]. Figure 2. Schematic for 3D printing using HARP. Taken from Ref. [1]. High-area rapid printing (HARP) is a stereolithography (SLA) method that permits the continuous, high-throughput printing of large objects at rapid speeds (Figure 1). This method was introduced in 2019 by the Mirkin Research Group at Northwestern University in order to address drawbacks associated with traditional SLA manufacturing processes. Since the polymerization reactions involved in SLA are highly exothermic processes, the production of objects at high-throughputs is associated with high temperatures that can result in structural defects. HARP addresses this problem by utilizing a solid-liquid slip boundary (Figure 2) that cools the resin by withdrawing heat from the system. This allows for large structures to be fabricated quickly without the temperature-associated defects inherent to other SLA processes. Design and Advantages Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has allowed for the rapid prototyping of intricate structures that are not accessible via traditional manufacturing processes and has found specific applications in tissue engineering and high-strength materials production. SLA is one such approach, which typically utilizes ultraviolet light to cure a photoactive resin onto a vertically moving plate. Stereolithography is traditionally realized by printing successive 2D layers between the vertically moving plate and the bottom of the vat in order to build up a three-dimensional (3D) object. This process is time-consuming as each layer must be mechanically cleaved from the bottom of the resin vat before another layer can be printed. Recent advances employ an oxygen ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù between the bottom of the vat and the polymerized object to achieve continuous liquid interface production (CLIP). Because the polymerizing object is no longer in contact with the bottom of the resin vat, mechanical cleavage is not necessary, making CLIP a continuous stereolithographic process. CLIP is being used by Carbon 3D to manufacture parts approximately 100 times faster than traditional SLA methodologies. At these print speeds, however, the heat generated from the exothermic polymerization reactions can result in deformation of the printed object. Figure 3. A comparison of temperatures arising from SLA printing with HARP with (A) no oil flow; (B) oil flow but no cooling; or (C) oil flow and cooling of the oil using a heat exchanger. Elapsed time between panels is ~500 s; Scale bars = 25 mm. Taken from Ref. [1]. HARP utilizes a circulating fluorinated oil layer below the resin to remove heat at the boundary between the oil and the resin, cooling the system (Figure 2). The fluorinated oil is circulated at a rate that supports the formation of a solid-liquid slip boundary, and therefore, low adhesion between the printed object and the transparent vat. The slip boundary ensures uniformity of both topology and temperature across the interface and allows for continuous printing but at substantially higher throughputs than CLIP. The heat dissipation is a consequence of the direct contact between the fluorinated oil and the hot, polymerizing resin, since heat is effectively transferred from the resin to the oil. The hot oil is then flowed out of the reaction bath, cooled, filtered, and subsequently reintroduced into the system. Thus, control over the temperature of the system is attained. Even the printing of small structures via a SLA process at high-throughput without cooling results in temperatures at which deformation of the desired structure occurs (Figure 3A). In contrast, when HARP is used with cooling, markedly decreased temperatures are observed without a reduction in part quality (Figure 3C). HARP is also compatible with traditional stereolithographic resins; this has been demonstrated with polyurethane acrylate, butadiene rubber, and silicon carbide ceramic. At the time of writing, HARP had printed the largest structure based on SLA 3D printing (0.30 x 0.30 x 1.2-meters) to date in approximately three hours (Figure 1). Professor Chad Mirkin, Dr. James Hedrick, and Dr. David Walker founded Azul3D (previously CDJ Technologies) for the purpose of commercializing the HARP platform. COVID-19 Response During the COVID-19 pandemic, HARP was used to manufacture personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential healthcare personnel working on the front lines of the crisis. In cooperation with local manufacturers, Azul 3D manufactured face shields at the rate of 1,000 per day on a state-of-the-art, 13-foot-tall HARP 3D printer. The company also stated they were accelerating production of new printers with the goal of reaching 20,000 face shields per week. In an interview that aired on WGN-TV on March 25th, 2020, Dr. Chad Mirkin (Chairman of the Board of Azul3D) said, > ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focusing on things the smaller printers just won‚Äôt have the > throughput to deal with.

Categories  The GovernmentRisk360 methodology includes six categories of risk: * External Risks ** Political Risk assessing changes in the political landscape, focused on matters such as electoral cycles, government stability and other localised political events. ** Regulatory Risk where a change in government regulation creates new conditions on operations (such as packaging or promotion restrictions). ** Operational Risk where a shift in government focus or policy disrupt business inputs (such as energy policy settings) required for normal business operations. * Internal Risks ** Reputation Risk where an organisation‚Äôs actions impact on their licence to operate and hamper their ability to engage with government stakeholders. ** Compliance Risk created through an organisation‚Äôs or industry‚Äôs failure to address or enforce critical compliance criteria which could trigger an escalated government policy or regulatory response. ** Opportunity Risk where an organisation has limited visibility or influence of government stakeholders, relationships, institutions, or policy settings and so are unable to realise opportunities. Each of the categories has a range of indicators that form the methodology. The relative importance and prevalence of the indicators varies depends on the company, industry, program and environment. For example, in the lead up to any relevant jurisdiction‚Äôs election, aspects of Political Risk just as changing government and/or responsible Minister may be more relevant than in between election cycles.  Applications  The methodology applies to any industry or sector and there are often commonalities across sectors or similar organisations: * Political Risk ‚Äì Queensland Coal vs Climate Jobs Narrative - In the 2019 Federal election, the Labor Party suffered a 4% swing against them in Queensland, largely attributed to the perceived threat to jobs associated with Labor‚Äôs position on the Adani Coal mine. The mine was commonly believed to be creating around 10,000 jobs. Queensland is also facing significant tourism job losses associated with coral bleaching. The Great Barrier Reef is estimated to contribute more than 64,000 jobs and the impacts on the economy from those job losses creates a future political dilemma. This creates a high political risk associated with potential change in government and/or policy focus area on job creation for both sectors, but particularly for tourism operators in Queensland who may be anticipating government action in this space. * Opportunity Risk ‚Äì Coordinated Industry Approaches ‚Äì a common opportunity risk presents where an industry does not collectively act in response to growing sentiment and creates a situation of possible political intervention. For example, in the case of Tasmanian Salmon fishing, there is growing public disapproval centred on the ‚Äòred‚Äô rating and a Parliamentary inquiry. The industry is well connected and carries significant political weight as a major employer, but this profile and rapport may only have limited runway particularly in the event of a significant environmental issue and/or through reputation erosion during the Inquiry as outlined above. There is opportunity for the industry to demonstrate leadership in collectively managing a limited resource and providing an industry led solution to government to address ongoing overcrowding. This could be achieved through partnership efforts such as the collaboration between the Salmon Enterprises of Tasmania and CSIRO that aimed to address stock losses.  Use and Limitations  The GovernmentRisk360 methodology is used by organisations to assess their profile or specific projects through a number of tools to assess government risk which provide reporting inputs to broader risk management and government engagement planning. The methodology can be used in decision-making situations to inform risk management before further actions are taken and to guide deployment of resources. GovernmentRisk360 may also be used in long term strategic planning to inform business goals and objectives with respect to government activities. GovernmentRisk360 was designed with an Australian domestic focus and is limited to firms and organisations currently or potentially operating in Australia.

Z (commonly abbreviated as SMBZ) is a British Flash-animated fan crossover action-adventure web series created and produced by Mark Haynes, which debuted on Newgrounds on April 22, 2006. Using video game sprites to illustrate, the series's story and style is inspired by Dragon Ball Z and features characters from the Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog franchises. The series follows five heroes: Mario, Sonic, Luigi, Shadow and Yoshi, as they race to find the seven Chaos Emeralds before Metallix (Turbo Mecha Sonic), a robot bent on becoming the most powerful being in the universe. The series ran for eight episodes before being canceled in 2012. In September 2015, Haynes announced a reboot of the series to be in development, releasing the pilot in early 2016,https://www.nintendoreporters.com/en/news/general/super-mario-bros- z-returning-after-3-years/ as well as launching a Patreon to crowdfund the series which later received a DMCA takedown from Nintendo. After a four-year hiatus, Haynes citing personal issues, the reboot series resumed active development in February 2020, with Haynes premiering a 4K remaster of the original series to YouTube the following month. Both the original and rebooted series have been positively received. Story In both the original and rebooted series, the story is centered in the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Luigi are competing against Wario and Waluigi until Bowser and Kamek interfere and attempt to take over the kingdom. Their plans are inadvertently foiled by the arrival of Sonic and Shadow, survivors of a mass genocide on the planet Mobius caused by the robot Metallix (Turbo Mecha Sonic in the original series). The two seek to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, which Shadow banished from their world for safekeeping, before Metallix can use them to achieve unlimited power. Mario and Luigi agree to aid them in their search. Elsewhere, Yoshi finds a Chaos Emerald, but is nearly killed by Metallix, who has already obtained another Emerald. While Yoshi heals at Mario's House, the heroes receive a third Emerald from Professor E. Gadd, but it is stolen by the Koopa Bros. Rejoined by Yoshi, they travel to Yoshi's Island to acquire the fourth Chaos Emerald. Both the Koopa Bros. and the Axem Rangers X interfere, and the three groups engage each other in battle. Metallix arrives and kills both rival teams, only for the heroes to steal back all four Emeralds and narrowly escape. The group then retrieves the fifth Chaos Emerald from the Minus World, a pocket dimension accessed via a maze filled with Warp Pipes. Upon their return, they discover Princess Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser. The heroes formulate a plan to rescue her, but Shadow is fed up by Sonic's perceived lack of focus on their hunt for the Chaos Emeralds. He leaves the team to collect the other two on his own, later engaging Metallix in battle alone for the sixth Chaos Emerald. Elsewhere, Doctor Eggman, Metallix's creator and Sonic's former archenemy, is revealed to have survived the destruction of Mobius and allied himself with Bowser. Using a combination of his robotics and Kamek's magic, Eggman creates \\"Mecha Mario\\", a robotic duplicate of Mario designed to kill him. After facing Bowser's elite henchman Captain Basilisx, the heroes prepare to battle Bowser's children, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings. Characters *Mario ‚Äì The hero of the Mushroom Kingdom, who offers to help Sonic and Shadow stop Metallix from collecting the Chaos Emeralds. *Luigi ‚Äì Mario's cowardly younger brother, who assists in preventing Metallix from acquiring the Chaos Emeralds. *Sonic the Hedgehog ‚Äì The hero of the planet Mobius and self-proclaimed \\"fastest thing alive\\". After his world is destroyed, he and Shadow flee to the Mushroom Kingdom in pursuit of the Chaos Emeralds to prevent their misuse by Metallix. *Shadow the Hedgehog ‚Äì A bioengineered \\"ultimate life form\\" and resident of Mobius, who aims to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds and destroy Metallix himself in retribution for the death of Rouge the Bat. * Yoshi ‚Äì A member of the Yoshi clan, who joins Mario's group in their fight against Metallix. *Metallix ‚Äì A robot created by Dr. Eggman as an evolution of Metal Sonic, created for the sole purpose of destroying Sonic. He later rebels against his creator and destroys Mobius, later travelling to the Mushroom Kingdom in search of the Chaos Emeralds. In the original series, he is referred to as Turbo Mecha Sonic, or informally as Mecha Sonic; the name Metallix originates from the UK comic series Sonic the Comic. The character was redesigned for the reboot series due to Haynes' belief that the original design was underwhelming and inconsistent with the character's original portrayal in Sonic & Knuckles. *Wario and Waluigi ‚Äì Mario and Luigi's rivals, who seek to steal the Chaos Emeralds and sell them for profit. *Princess Peach ‚Äì The ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, who is often kidnapped by Bowser. She offers aid to Mario, Luigi, Sonic and Shadow as they search for the Chaos Emeralds. *Bowser ‚Äì The king of the Koopas and archenemy of Mario and Luigi, who seeks to acquire the Chaos Emeralds and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. He is aided by his children Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings. *Professor E. Gadd ‚Äì A Mushroom Kingdom scientist who provides support for the heroes, creating devices to aid them such as the Emerald Radar. *The Koopa Bros. ‚Äì A group of four ninja Koopa Troopas from Paper Mario who seek to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds for Bowser. *Axem Rangers X ‚Äì A team of five axe- wielding robots who were rebuilt by Smithy after being destroyed by Mario in Super Mario RPG. They seek the Chaos Emeralds for themselves to further Smithy's plans. *Captain Basilisx ‚Äì The captain of Bowser's Koopa Guard stationed on the Omega Doomship, capable of turning people to stone with his gaze. He seeks revenge on Mario for having killed his best friend during the events of Super Mario World. An original character created for the series, Basilisx is named in reference to the mythological beast of the same name, while his hands' retractable claws are inspired by the Marvel Comics character Wolverine. EpisodesThe Turbo Mecha Sonic Saga (2006‚Äì2009; 2012)The Metallix Saga (2016; 2020‚Äìpresent)ShortsThe Smithy Saga=Production and broadcast The series uses sprites from various Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog video games and arranges them to create anime- style action scenes. Super Mario Bros. Z is animated using Adobe Flash, and features dynamic, fast-paced movement in the style of Dragon Ball Z. Characters are rendered using a combination of pre-existing sprites and original pixel graphics created for the series. The series primarily conveys dialogue using text boxes, but features limited voice acting through the reuse of voice clips from Dragon Ball Z and various Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog games. The lone exception is the seventh episode of the original series, which features cameo appearances by Andrew Raskin and Patrick TeNyenhuis reprising their roles as Hal the Koopa Troopa and Jeff the Goomba from the web series Bowser's Kingdom. The series was conceptualized as a remake of Dragon Ball Z featuring characters from the Mario and Sonic series, inspired by various similar parody concepts Haynes had watched on Newgrounds. The first episode was animated over the course of one month, and premiered on Newgrounds on April 22, 2006. New episodes released every few months for the following three years, with its eighth and last full-length episode releasing on October 9, 2009. On March 30, 2012, following a three year hiatus, Haynes announced the cancellation of the series, releasing an unfinished work-in-progress version of the ninth episode. In subsequent years there were several unofficial attempts at reviving the series, including a Kickstarter campaign for a feature-length film finale launched in September 2013, intended to lead into a sequel series titled Super Mario Galaxy X, which received a takedown notice from Nintendo. A reboot of the series was announced in September 2015, with a pilot being released to Newgrounds on January 8, 2016. Initially, Haynes intended to fund episodes of the series via Patreon, but was sent a Nintendo additionally sent Haynes a DMCA takedown notice by Nintendo preventing him from doing so. Haynes subsequently placed the rebooted series on hiatus, citing personal reasons, before resuming work and uploading the pilot episode to YouTube on March 1, 2020. In early 2020, Alen Alic and Jason Kaufman began development of a remaster of the original series (excising the incomplete ninth episode) in 4K resolution, with the blessing of Haynes. Rendered by Kaufman and edited by Alic, the remaster was uploaded to Haynes' YouTube channel as a feature film on March 7, 2020. Super Mario Bros. Z has also produced spin-off media focused on supporting characters, as well as bonus material including \\"Making of\\" and \\"Behind the Scenes\\" videos, as well as \\"Extra Credit\\" (outtakes), available on Haynes' Patreon and Ko-Fi pages. Reception Super Mario Bros. Z attracted interest immediately, with the series premiere receiving 50,000 views within a day of its release. The first episode has been viewed over nine million times across Newgrounds and YouTube, and most episodes have received views in the millions. , the series' new YouTube channel has over 30,000 subscribers and over 30 million views. Both series have won Newgrounds Tank Awards. The series was praised for its memorability by Newgrounds founder Tom Fulp, who raised the file limit of the website to allow Haynes to upload the eighth episode. Bit 128 of Podcast One described the series as \\"ag[ing] like a mostly fine wine.\\" Rosa Fern√°ndez of Zona Red praised the Haynes' reboot for \\"[its] new material and [for] tak[ing] advantage of new technologies to make the chapters as [Haynes] had them in mind ten years ago\\", describing it as \\"a cult series that has been reborn\\", while Emmanuel Perrin of Gent Side praised the series for its \\"explosive promise\\", crossover elements, and use of Dragon Ball Z imagery.

Retrieved May 27, 2020 History LifeBank, formerly Rural Bank of Maasin (Iloilo), Inc. was established on March 21, 1970 by the Perlas Family (Familia Perlas) and other prominent members of the community of the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo. The objective of the bank was to extend financial services in areas where access to credit was limited. In 1993, the Board of Directors held its first planning and visioning session where the bank‚Äôs vision and mission was defined. This was when the Sustainable Development Investment Unit (SDIU) was set up. This was a unit to be developed that would institutionalize lending for sustainable development projects, the objective of which is the development of the human potential. In June 1995, a branch was established in the Municipality of Santa Barbara, Iloilo. The branch experienced phenomenal growth as its deposits, loan portfolio and resources increased beyond expectations while recognizing and affirming trust within the community. It was also in 1995 that the Ikabuhi Microfinance Program (IMP) was established. The program aims to activate savings and provide credit to enterprising poor women. In 1998, the bank adopted the Grameen methodology for its micro-finance program, which initially produced positive results. Later on, weaknesses in the management information system and program policies were observed prompting management to look for a better alternative. It was in November 2000 where the bank became a program partner of the Microfinance Support Program (MSP) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP where the bank was introduced to the Association for Social Advancement (ASA) (pronounced as ASHA, a Bangladeshi word meaning HOPE). Since then, the bank has been implementing the Association for Social Advancement (ASA) methodology with incredible results as proven by its almost 100% repayment rate, early sustainability and rapid expansion. After covering most of Iloilo, the Board created the LifeBank Foundation, Inc. (LBF) in January 2003 to carry the expansion of the program outside the province. At the time, the Bank did not have the required capital to operate outside Iloilo province. While LBRB continued to grow in assets and capital, LBF‚Äôs microfinance operation grew to cover Panay and other parts of the country (Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao). In 2008, LBRB, having reached the required capitalization to operate in other parts of the country, started purchasing microfinance portfolio from LBF in the provinces of Iloilo, Guimaras, Antique, Aklan and Capiz. LifeBank RB expanded with a head office in Santa Barbara, Iloilo, three (3) branches and fifteen (15) BLUs. The branches are located in Maasin, Iloilo (since March 1970; formerly the Head Office), Iloilo City (since May 2011) and Roxas City, Capiz (since May 2013). In addition, Thirty One (31) Branch Lite Units (BLUs) were established. These are operating in the Provinces of Iloilo (Municipalities of Barotac Nuevo, Miag-ao, Sara, Balasan, Oton, Pototan, Iloilo and Passi City), Guimaras (Municipality of Jordan), Capiz (Municipality of Mambusao), Aklan (Municipalities of Kalibo, Altavas and Caticlan, Malay) and Antique (Municipalities of San Jose, Bugasong and Culasi). In 2018, LifeBank's NGO microfinance arm was officially renamed from LifeBank Foundation, Inc. to LifeBank Microfinance Foundation, Inc. (LifeBank MFI or LBMF) but was later rolled out in 2019 to all its units. In the said same year, due to its rolling of company decentralization plan, LifeBank MFI has been re-organized into zones and districts with branches in lieu of units. The LifeBank MFI on the other hand, has 477 branches, 22 area/district offices, and 12 zonal offices in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, covering 300,000+ clients as the 3rd largest microfinancial institution in the country after ASA Philippines (Philippine arm of ASA, the largest microfinancial institution in the world) and Card Bank. Corporate administration The LifeBank's two corporate arms, the LifeBank RB (LBRB) and LifeBank MFI (LBMF), are both managed by the same board of directors/board of trustees. LifeBank MFI is headed by Vicente \\"Vince\\" P. Perlas, a medical doctor by profession, while the LifeBank RB's president is his wife, Rosario \\"Charrie\\" Perlas, also a medical doctor. Perlas family have long been the one who manages the LifeBank since it was founded on March 21, 1970 as Rural Bank of Maasin (Iloilo), Inc. The Perlas family which manages LifeBank, are Spanish/European-Filipino family like the Ayala and Zobel, Aboitiz, Lop√©z, and Razon families. Through Perlas Group (LifeBank Group), the 2 companies has other sister, affiliate or related companies owned by any member of the said family which include: Seaboard Insurance, Bluefields Hypermart and Bluefields Hardware, Lolo Jose Kitchen and Liv Healthy Kitchen. Notable member of corporation's Board of Directors/Trustees is Nicanor Perlas (Nick Perlas).

The greater part of the country is covered either with tall coarse grasses, or more commonly with thick thorn-bush or jungle, among which rise occasional isolated, trees. The prevalent bush plants are khansa, acacias, aloes, and, especially, Boswellia and Commiphora, which yield highly fragrant resins and balsams, such as myrrh, frankincense (olibanum) and balm of Gilead. Among the larger trees are the mountain cedar, reaching to 100 ft.; the gob, which bears edible berries in appearance something like the cherry with the taste of an apple, grows to some 80 ft.

Enslavement of Jews Slavery is codified in numerous verses in the Torah.Jewish Encyclopedia: Slaves and Slavery The duty of treating the Hebrew servant and handmaid otherwise than as slaves, and above all their retention in service for a limited time only, was deemed by the lawgiver of such importance that the subject was put next to the Decalogue at the very head of civil legislation (Ex. xxi. 2-11). It is treated in its legal bearings also (Lev. xxv. 39-54; Deut. xv. 12-18). After the destruction of the First Temple, the prophets of Israel abolished the enslavement of Israelites by Israelites. During the Second Temple period, the prophet Nehemiah rebuked the wealthy Jews for continuing to enslave poor Jews.Jewish Encyclopedia: Antislavery and the Jews After the downfall of the first monarchy the right to hold fellow Hebrews as slaves was regarded as at an end, although an attempt was made to reintroduce the enslavement of Hebrews immediately after the restoration. Nehemiah, however, successfully resisted the endeavor (Neh. v. 5-10). Offerings in the Temple So long as the Temple stood, offering certain korban to God was obligatory.Jewish Encyclopedia: Sacrifice ...compulsory or obligatory offerings (private and public praise-offerings, public holocausts, and others). After the destruction of the Second Temple during the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), korban was replaced with works of mercy.Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49 Rabbi Elazar said: One who performs acts of charity is greater than one who sacrifices all types of offerings, as it is stated: ‚ÄúTo perform charity and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than an offering‚Äù (Proverbs 21:3), including all types of offerings. And Rabbi Elazar said: Acts of kindness, assisting someone in need, are greater than charity, as it is stated: ‚ÄúSow to yourselves according to charity, and reap according to kindness‚Äù (Hosea 10:12). This means: If a person sows, it is uncertain whether he will eat or whether he will not eat, since much can go wrong before the seed becomes food. However, if a person reaps, he certainly eats. In this verse, charity is likened to sowing, while acts of kindness are likened to reaping.

Description The species can reach a length of 152 mm (6 in) to 198 mm (7.8 in). Like most flying fish, E. peruivanus exhibits countershading with the body colored iridescent blue from above and silvery white from below. The pectoral fin is light brown while the dorsal fin is light gray. The caudal fin is also gray and both the anal fin and ventral fins are non-pigmented. The species has very few teeth if any and are rarely spaced when present. The osteological character of E. peruivanus is very similar to that of Exocoetus obtusirostris. However, in this species, the posterolateral process of cleithrum head reaches far past the scapular orifice. Juveniles are typically 34 mm (1.3 in) to 78 mm (3 in) and humpbacked. They have a steep upper profile with the antedorsal distance being larger than anteanal distance. At 16 mm (0.6 in) to 34 mm (1.3 in), juveniles have dark transverse bands on the trunk and the posterior part of their pectoral and dorsal fins are dark. At this length and smaller, the pectoral fins are largely transparent with light gray pigmentation in the anterior and posterior parts.

It represents a form of reptile footprints and trackways, likely produced by small tanystropheids such as Tanytrachelos. Gwyneddichnium includes a single species, Gwyneddichnium major (also spelled G. majore). Two other proposed species, G. elongatum and G. minore, are indistinguishable from G. major apart from their smaller size and minor taphonomic discrepancies. As a result, they are considered junior synonyms of G. major.  Description  Gwyneddichnium corresponds to footprints from a quadrupedal animal with a small pentadactyl (five-fingered) manus (hand) and a notably larger five-toed pes (foot). The manus and pes are mesaxonic, meaning that the third digit is the longest digit, followed by the subequal second and fourth digits. The innermost digit (digit I) and the outermost digit (digit V) were short and located close to the rest of the foot. Sometimes the small fifth digit is poorly preserved, making the hand or foot appear to be tetradactyl (having only four digits). Overall, the digits are long and narrow, with minimal curvature. There is some variation with how the digits are positioned, with some specimens having digits which evenly radiate away from the sole, and others having digits which separate into two clumps, digits I-III and IV-V. The skin made pad-like impressions with a characteristic nodular shape, and small, pointed claw impressions are also present. Some specimens preserved irregularly-shaped sole impressions and/or tail drag marks, but these are not always preserved. One purported Gwyneddichnium trackway (CU-MWC 159.10) has been interpreted as swimming traces due to the absence of manus prints. Skin webbing appears to be present between toes I-III, though the webbing has also been interpreted as sediment deformation. Gwyneddichnium trackways in general are widely spaced, with pes prints pointing forwards and manus prints rotated outwards. The positions of the pes and manus prints relative to each other are variable, corresponding to different speeds and gaits. The overall shape of the footprints are similar to Rhynchosauroides, which sometimes occurs alongside Gwyneddichnium. However, Rhynchosauroides has an exaxonic print (with the fourth digit longer than the third), more curvature in the digits, and a fifth digit more widely separated from the fourth.  Distribution  Gwyneddichnium fossils were first collected by Wilhelm Bock at Gwynedd, a railroad outcrop in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Gwynedd preserves sediments from the late Triassic Lockatong Formation, part of the Newark Supergroup exposed in the Newark Basin. Bock's specimens, now stored at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, include ANSP 15212 (the holotype of G. major), ANSP 15213 (the paratype of G. major), ANSP 15214 (the holotype of \\"G. elongatum\\"), ANSP 15215 (the paratype of \\"G. elongatum\\", now considered lost), ANSP 15216 (the holotype of \\"G. minore\\"), and ANSP 15217 (the paratype of \\"G. minore\\"). Various outcrops throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey which express the Lockatong Formation continue to produce Gwyneddichnium fossils. Gwyneddichnium is also known to occur within the overlying Passaic Formation. Outside of the Newark Basin, Gwyneddichnium tracks have also been found in the Bull Run Formation (also known as the \\"Balls Bluff Siltstone\\") at Manassas National Battlefield Park in the Culpeper Basin of Virginia. They are also known from the New Oxford or Gettysburg Formation of the Gettysburg Basin in Maryland. Reports of Gwyneddichnium trackways in the western United States began to surface in the 1990s. These included both typical trackways from walking animals, and unusual swimming trackways which were provisionally referred to the ichnogenus. The earliest western Gwyneddichnium tracks to be discovered hail from several sites in Northeast Utah and Northwest Colorado. Many of these sites lie within the boundaries of Dinosaur National Monument. The sites in the area preserve the Rock Point Member of the upper Triassic Chinle Formation, though they were originally reported as representing the age-equivalent Popo Agie Formation. Possible Gwyneddichnium prints are also known from the Chinle Formation's Owl Creek Member. These rare fossils were found at Brinkerhof Spring, a site in south-central Utah near Capitol Reef National Park. Brinkerhof Spring is located in Circle Cliffs, a natural amphitheater formerly protected within the boundaries of Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monument, but excluded when the monument was shrunk in 2017. In 2007, a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Apachepus cottonorum, was named from the Redonda Formation of New Mexico. However, Apachepus cottonorum was subsequently considered a species of Gwyneddichnium (Gwyneddichnium cottonorum) after pentadactyl manus prints were discovered. G. cottonorum was distinguished from G. major by its larger size and more evenly spaced digits. Further sampling has suggested that these differences are not as clear-cut as suggested, so Gwyneddichnium cottonorum is currently considered a junior synonym of Gwyneddichnium majore. The only locale outside the United States known to produce Gwyneddichnium prints is the Berndorf site in Germany. Berndorf is located near Kemnath in Bavaria and preserves a clastic portion of the lower Muschelkalk known as the Eschenbach Formation. The rocks of the Eschenbach Formation are from the lower middle Triassic (Anisian stage), making their prints the oldest known Gwyneddichnium fossils.  Trackmaker  Gwyneddichnium was originally tentatively suggested as being created by small pseudosuchians. The discovery of the small tanystropheid archosauromorph Tanytrachelos provided a more specific and well-supported trackmaker for Gwyneddichnium. Tanytrachelos and other tanystropheids have an unusual metatarsal-like phalange in the fifth toe which points forwards (like that of Gwyneddichnium) rather than curves back like other reptiles. Tanytrachelos in particular is the most likely trackmaker due to its wide gait, small size, co- occurrence with the tracks, and feet with a fourth digit shorter than the third. Though Tanytrachelos is by far the most commonly considered trackmaker for Gwyneddichnium, small drepanosaurs such as Hypuronector or Dolabrosaurus have also been proposed as trackmakers. This is considered unlikely due to their unusual morphology. At least in the Chinle and Redonda formations, small lepidosauromorphs have been suggested as trackmakers for Gwyneddichnium.

(Tactical Armor Command) is a top-down tactical combat videogame published by Avalon Hill in 1983 for Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game takes place during the Second World War and simulates clashes involving the United States, the USSR, Germany and the United Kingdom. Publication history TAC is a wargame designed by Ralph Bosson of Microcomputer Games, a division of Avalon Hill. The game was originally released for Apple II in 1983. It was later ported to Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64 and IBM PC. Description and gameplay TAC simulates, on a tactical scale, armored vehicle combat during the Second World War. It can be played by a single player against the computer at four different difficulty levels, or against another player simultaneously on the same computer. =Scenarios= The game offers five different scenarios: # A standard engagement between the two forces. # An attack against a defensive position that is protected by a minefield which can only be removed by infantry units. # An attack against a defensive position unguarded by mines, where the defender must successfully escape along a given route. # The player faces a continuous stream of Russian tanks and tries to destroy as many as possible. # The two forces are initially separated by a minefield which they must clear in order to engage. =Set- up= Each player chooses which nation to play: United States, Soviet Union, Germany or the United Kingdom. For each nation, eight types of armored vehicles are available. After choosing a scenario, each player is allocated a certain number of points with which to buy different units, including infantry, tanks and anti-tank guns. For example, a player choosing the Americans can choose armored vehicles like the M4 Sherman, the M10 Wolverine, the M26 Pershing, the M3 Lee or the M8 Greyhound. =Map= The game takes place on a map representing a 1,800 √ó 2,000 meter section of a plain in northern Germany. The map is divided into fifteen sectors, identified by a letter (for the vertical axis) and a number (for the horizontal axis) and consisting of plain or forest. Each side can control up to eight units via the keyboard. Direction of movement, for example, on the Apple II and Commodore 64 is controlled with keys U, H, J and N, and on the IBM PC with the 8, 6, 2, and 4 keys on the number pad. (On the Atari 8-bit, all input is done with the joystick.) =Movement: Armor= When the movement phase begins, an armored unit advances in a straight line as far as possible, unless the player orders it to turn or turn around. =Movement: Infantry and artillery= Each unit of infantry and artillery units has a transport vehicle. When the unit is loaded on to the transport, it is in transport mode and cannot engage in combat. The unit becomes one with the transport vehicle, and if it is destroyed, the unit is also destroyed. When the infantry or artillery unit is unloaded, it is in combat mode and can fight. The unit is now independent of its transport vehicle and if the transport vehicle is destroyed, the unit can continue to fight. Without a transportation vehicle, infantry units can only move one square per player directional input. Artillery cannot move at all without a transportation vehicle. =Combat= Combat can take five different forms: # Apart from infantry, most units can attempt indirect fire against unseen enemies in suspected locations. # Armored combat vehicles can also overrun infantry or artillery units. # Infantry can storm armored vehicles # Infantry units can engage in a firefight with another infantry unit. # Artillery pieces can aim direct fire at any type of target. Reception In the August 1983 edition of Softalk (Vol. 3, No. 12), Ralph Bosson was impressed by the game, calling the graphics \\"first rate\\" and the attention to detail \\"awe inspiring.\\" He concluded, \\"TAC is a superb entry from Avalon Hill. It is a carefully researched and designed game of impressive sophistication, yet it's surprisingly easy to play and even a little addicting.\\" In the October 1983 edition of Computer Gaming World, Dick Richards saw it as a fun and relatively realistic simulation of tactical combat between armored vehicles, and thought it retained its replayability over time. He did think that the game could have been even better had it incorporated a greater variety of different terrains, such as roads, rivers and ravines. Richards concluded \\"My overall reaction to TAC is positive. The graphics and sound effects are good.\\" A review in the November‚ÄìDecember 1983 issue of Softline highlighted the superior graphics and sound effects of the game as well as its addictive game system. In the May 1984 edition of Electronic Games, Neil Shapiro was enthusiastic, calling the game \\"the best simulation of tank warfare this reviewer has seen on or off a computer screen.\\" He called the sound quality \\"fantastic\\" and the quality of the graphics \\"beautifully executed.\\" His only criticism was the lack of varied terrain, saying, \\"While the simulated \\"wooded plain\\" does have groves of trees in which to hide, such things as gullies and hills would have enriched the contest.\\" Shapiro concluded, \\"From the high-resolution display of the battlefield to the canny, computer opponent, just about every aspect of both simulation and play is tops.\\" References Category:1983 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Computer wargames Category:DOS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about Nazi Germany Category:World War II video games ","title":"TAC (video game)"},{"id":"64081976","text":"Adriaan Constant Tutein-Nolthenius (16 September 1892‚Äì 13 October 1954) was a Dutch-born Ceylonese tea planter, amateur naturalist, author and appointed member of parliament.

While the name may be misconstrued to mean the boat hull is flat, this is not generally the case and include various v-hull designs. However some flats boats designs, sometimes called skiffs are truly a flat- bottomed boat design. The deadrise (which, simplified, is a measure of the angle of bottom in v-hull boats) of most flats boats is generally a small angle because larger deadrise often requires more water displacement which increase the boat's draft and is not desirable for flats boats in shallow water. However, lower deadrise may produce a rougher ride in choppy water than a comparable boat with larger deadrise angle.  Common Features  Flats boats are often small easily trailerable boats although some may reach up to 23 ft in length or more. They are typically equipped with outboard motors and offer a relatively shallow draft compared to other boats of the same length, to allow for passage over sandbars, oyster beds or other submerged objects or underwater features with less risk of damaging the hull or engine. Some flats boats may be equipped with features such as a \\"jack plate\\" which allow the operator of the boat to lift the outboard vertically in addition to the tilt and trim mechanisms generally offered by many outboard motors. They may also be equipped with trim tabs. Both jack plates and trim tabs can offer an advantage in shallow water starts to plane among other uses. Additionally, some flats boats may be equipped with a \\"poling platform\\" which allows for a fishing guide or other person to push the boat in shallow water while an angler fishes from the bow. Flats boats may be designed as an open cockpit and tiller controlled outboard motor, a side console or center console.  Micro- skiffs  Micro-skiffs (which are, generally, a smaller and lighter, no-frills design similar to a number of flats boats) may be considered by some as a subcategory of flats boat.  Safety Concerns  Some concerns have been raised about the safety of certain designs of flats boats, particularly the tunnel vee, according to a USCG study in 2013. Tunnel vee boats, sometimes referred to as tunnel hull boats, are a design in which the center of the boat hull is essentially cut out for some length into a shape which may be somewhat similar to a catamaran in that in that section the boat hull may resemble sponsons instead of coming to a \\"vee\\" shape at the bottom. This design allows for mounting (or raising with a jack plate) the outboard motor higher while still allowing significant water flow to the propeller and the motor's cooling water intake. One advantage of this design is when operating the boat at speed in shallow waters with the engine raised where there is less restriction for the upward flow of water to the outboard motor's cooling water intake.

Along with the Old Tolland County Jail and Museum, the Tolland County Courthouse, and the Daniel Benton Homestead, the Hicks-Stearns Family Museum is one of Tolland's four major landmarks.  House  The Hicks-Stearns family house is a transition home, featuring a colonial-era kitchen and a Victorian- era parlor and furnishings. Collections include family heirlooms, cloth tea balls, Victrola, and faux bamboo furniture. The house's original owner was Benoni Shepard, a Congregationalist deacon and Tolland's first postmaster. The museum hosts tours, concerts, and holiday programs from May through December.  Hicks family  The house's most prominent resident was Ratcliffe Hicks (1843-1906), eldest son of Charles Hicks, a successful merchant from Providence, Rhode Island, and Maria Stearns. Ratcliffe was a Brown University graduate (1864), successful lawyer and industrialist (president of the Canfield Rubber Works in Bridgeport), and Connecticut state legislator. Ratcliffe renovated and expanded the family house with many Victorian elements, adding a front porch and a distinctive three-story tower. When Ratcliffe Hicks died in 1906, his will established a trust (worth a quarter of his estate) to start a school of agriculture and forestry in Connecticut. The school opened in 1941 as part of the University of Connecticut. UConn's Ratcliffe Hicks School of Agriculture and the Ratcliffe Hicks Building & Arena are named after him. Dedicated in 1951, UConn's Elizabeth Hicks Residence Hall is a women's dormitory named after Ratcliffe's daughter, painter and philanthropist Elizabeth Hicks (1884-1974).

Her father was Charles Martel, a Frankish statesman and military leader. She was a princess and \\"of singular beauty\\". She was sought after for marriage, but she refused, wanting to devote herself to God instead. Her father treated her with \\"studied brutality and public insult\\"; she went to his chaplain, who was also her spiritual director, for support and advice, so Martel expelled them both from his palace. They journeyed to Kitzingen, in modern Bavaria, a \\"wild and desert place\\", where they built a convent. She was made the convent's first abbess; the convent attracted virgins and was directed to follow the rules of St. Benedict and St. Scholastica. Martel later reconciled with and visited Adeloga, and donated lands for her convent.

History The St. Paul Association of Commerce sponsored a city-wide contest for a new city flag. The winner was designed by College of St. Catherine art student Gladys Mittle and was officially adopted on November 22, 1932. The first major display of the flag was on March 30, 1935, when thousands were flown for St. Paul Day. A 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey of United States city flags placed St. Paul's as number 44th, ranking below the Flag of Minneapolis. Mayor Randy Kelly reportedly expressed interest in orchestrating a new flag contest around the time of the survey, however, this idea did not take off. Prior to this, the flag was somewhat hard to find throughout the city, with one vexillologist unable to find any public displays. Since then, the flag has experienced a growth in popularity, with one Blogspot website selling between 200 and 300 flags in 2014. The flag has been spotted at large venues such as CHS Field, Minnesota United FC games and mini-golf course Can Can Wonderland.

It is dedicated to Ole Bull. The year 1858 is printed on the title page of the first edition, but it was not issued until 1859. The book is distinguished by its realistic portrayal of mental life: minds that go astray, confinement, communication difficulties, unclear longings, and problems of conscience. Plot The novel's protagonist, Arne Kampen, is the son of the hardworking cotter's daughter Margit and the disorderly master dancer and fiddler Nils Skr√¶dder. Nils is obviously a frustrated artist, an unbalanced man that women are drawn to, deceitful, violent, and increasingly alcoholic. He eventually becomes both physically and mentally disabled. (This theme appears in other works by Bj√∏rnson; for example, in the novel Thrond). Arne almost resorts to murder to protect his mother against his father. His father's legacy is difficult to bear. Arne has good reasons to yearn and leave, but his love for his mother, for his work to improve Kampen (a former cotter's farm), and for Eli B√∏en, the girl who understands him and appreciates his songs, eventually lead him to settle down. Reception The book received mixed reviews from critics. Aasmund Olavsson Vinje wrote ironically that he liked \\"the naked, breathless depiction of life's poverty\\" but found too much Raasmak og Raatev 'raw taste and raw smell' in it. Clemens Pedersen thought that Arne probably testified to a more developed talent than Synn√∏ve Solbakken, but he was still not so much captivated by it, whereas Georg Brandes found that Arne was the most interesting of Bj√∏rnson's peasant tales.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Cicero, but few achieved any great distinction in the Roman state.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

Praenomina The Tadii seem to have used a variety of common praenomina, including Publius, Quintus, Titus, Sextus, and Marcus. One inscription shows that they also used the Sabine praenomen Attius. Members * Titus Tadius At. f. Drusus, buried at Amiternum in Sabinum, along with his wife, Rutilia Rufa..PW, Tadius 3. * Tadius, sought the advice of Titus Pomponius Atticus with regard to some property that he held. The property was legally owned by an unmarried girl, for whom a guardian had been appointed; but Atticus informed Tadius that the property was his by virtue of prescription. Cicero wrote to remind Atticus that no right of usucaption could exist in the case of such a ward, and was relieved to hear back that Atticus had settled the matter out of court, to Tadius' satisfaction.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 5, 8. * Publius Tadius, a negotiator, or money-lender, at Athens, who was employed as an agent of Verres in Sicily.

Early life  Tomasa was born in Iquique, Chile on December 1, 1986, to an upper-class family. She studied design in Santiago, Chile. According to Tomasa, she took on her stage name because she feels her whole life was marked by her skin color, and she thought Tomasa was a way to borrow the stereotype of black women who carry fruit on their head, despite not being black herself. Kids at school used to tease her by calling her Tomasa, but she eventually took to the name because it sounded both masculine and feminine. She said that she feels like \\"a man but very much a woman\\".  Musical career  During her time working in Iquique as a tattoo artist, Tomasa's mother bought her a laptop.

She came to believe that the education of young children was of vital importance as a basis upon which formal education could build. She established the American kindergarten, the first school of the kind in New York City, using a system based on more than twenty years of practical work in the school-room. Later, she founded the Normal Training School in East Orange, New Jersey. In 1872 she went to Europe for the purpose of studying educational methods.

Hume (middle), his wife, Katie (left) and an unidentified woman at their home Fairseat in Brisbane c.1890, Hume Family Collection, UQFL10, Album 6, Page 17, Fryer Library, The University of Queensland Library Walter Cunningham Hume (1839‚Äì1921) was a British surveyor who emigrated to Australia to provide for his family. He spent almost 40 years surveying the Darling Downs region of Queensland, helping to develop land policy. He was an active photographer whose work reflected life in Australia pre-federation.  Early life  Walter Cunningham Hume was born January 31, 1839 in Hampshire, the eldest of six children of Alexander Hume, a Scottish poet and lyricist and his wife Elizabeth Scott. His father worked as a brewer‚Äôs agent in between writing and travelled to the US either to meet American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson or to seek a more favourable climate. He did not return to England and died in 1851. Walter Hume‚Äôs mother established a school and the young Walter took lessons with her until he joined the P&O; Line as a midshipman. He probably met his future wife, Katie Fowler and her sisters at his mother‚Äôs boarding school and he visited the Fowler family between 1860-1862 at their home in Buckinghamshire.  Career and emigration to Australia  Hume rose from midshipman to Officer Second Class in the mercantile marine, taking his master‚Äôs licence. He left his position in the P&O; line in 1862, in order to advance his career and provide extra surety for the support of his family in England. He met Francis Thomas Gregory on one of his voyages. Gregory‚Äôs brother, Augustus Gregory was Surveyor General and Commissioner for Lands in the colony of Queensland, and Hume decided to pursue a surveying career under Gregory arriving in 1863. He took a loan and apprenticed to Francis Gregory for 18 months in St George, Queensland before being granted a Surveyor Second Class position in the Surveyor General‚Äôs Department in 1864. He was granted his own ‚ÄúCamp‚Äù and given the role of setting up towns and agricultural centres in the Darling Downs district, west of Brisbane. His mother, three of his sisters and a brother emigrated to Australia ahead of him. His sister, Marion married Francis Gregory, while his mother married a merchant and commission agent and sister Jenny Hume married a Toowoomba bank manager. His advancement in the Surveyor-General‚Äôs Department enabled him to propose marriage to Katie Fowler in 1864. Hume married Anna Kate ‚ÄúKatie‚Äù Fowler in Brisbane, Australia in 1866, after she arrived in Australia. Her father had been an architect and commissioner of the 1851 Great Exhibition. They lived in Drayton near Toowoomba. Hume was retrenched in 1867 but took up private surveying work the following year. They had eight children, five dying in early infancy. The family prospered as Hume was appointed Mineral Lands Commissioner in Stanthorpe in 1872. He undertook a geological survey of the area and the family split their time between Stanthorpe and Drayton. Hume was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands, Darling Downs District in 1875. He signed off on the establishment of the town of Texas on the Queensland and New South Wales state border. In 1876 the Humes moved to a new home ‚ÄúThe Hermitage‚Äù outside of Toowoomba. In 1877 Hume became a member of the Queensland Club, putting him amongst the state‚Äôs most distinguished businessmen and government circle. He was volunteer in the Queensland Marine Defence Force, enabling him to practise his mariner's skills. After a year long sabbatical in England in 1883, the Humes returned to Toowoomba and built a home they called \\"Fairseat\\". Hume was appointed the Under Secretary to the Department of Lands in 1884. They moved to Brisbane and resided in Torwood, in a home made available to them by Augustus Gregory on his Rainworth estate. They named this home ‚ÄúFairseat‚Äù in tribute to their previous home in Toowoomba and lived there for the next 15 years. Verandah at 'Fairseat', the residence of W.C. Hume at Torwood, Brisbane, 1890 (8759895757) In 1898, Hume became a judge of the Queensland Land Court. He retired from civil service in 1901 and the family elected to return to England. They returned to Australia to visit in 1907.  Legacy  Walter Hume died in Jersey in 1921 and was survived by his children, his wife pre-deceasing him in 1909. His 38 years of service as a surveyor as well as his contribution to Queensland‚Äôs land policy and administration was remarked upon in Queensland newspapers. The family‚Äôs diaries, photographs and letters, which record the growth of the state of Queensland, architecture, the 1893 floods and the social life of this era are held in the Fryer Library of the University of Queensland. The street of Hume in Rainworth, Brisbane is named for him.  Further reading  *Bonnin, Nancy. (1985). Katie Hume on the Darling Downs: A colonial marriage: Letters of a colonial lady, 1866-1871.

He is one of the few domestic mid laners to have recently competed in North America's LCS, alongside other players like Damonte and Pobelter.  Early life  Gilmer was born and raised in the town of Flower Mound, Texas. As a teenager he played varsity football for Edward S. Marcus High School. After receiving an offer from NA LCS team Dignitas in March 2014, Gilmer decided to quit football and focus on a career in professional esports.  Career  Dignitas signed Greyson \\"Goldenglue\\" Gilmer in March 2014 to replace their long-time mid laner William \\"Scarra\\" Li, who had agreed to transition to a coaching role. However, two weeks later Goldenglue was benched and Scarra was brought back to the mid lane; Goldenglue left the team shortly thereafter. Goldenglue played for several Challenger teams afterwards from mid-2014 to late 2016, and only played briefly for a few LCS teams during relegation matches or as an emergency substitute player. In late 2016 Goldenglue was offered a starting spot on Team Liquid for the 2017 NA LCS Spring Split, but was benched again after the team's disappointing performance in the first half of the regular season. Goldenglue returned to his starting position the next split but was benched again, prompting him to leave the team. Following the NA LCS' franchising in late 2017, Goldenglue joined Cloud9's academy team. During Goldenglue's stay on the team, Cloud9 Academy finished first in every regular season, but they were never able to win playoffs; the highest finish by the team was runners-up, which they accomplished twice. Despite helping Cloud9's main roster defeat Team SoloMid in the 2018 NA LCS Summer Playoffs, Goldenglue was not offered a starting position by any LCS team for the 2019 season, and he stayed on Cloud9 Academy for another year. In late 2019 Goldenglue was signed by Golden Guardians for the 2020 LCS Spring Split, but after barely qualifying for and finishing fifth/sixth in playoffs, Goldenglue was benched yet again and replaced by Damonte. Golden Guardians released Goldenglue from their starting roster shortly after, and Goldenglue made a statement saying he believed he was still LCS-caliber and would be trying out for teams as either a player or coach for the next split. Although initially not receiving any offers to play in the LCS for the summer split, Goldenglue was signed by Evil Geniuses on July 16, 2020, after the first half of the regular season.

First introduced in the 1980s, injector pens are designed to make injectable medication easier and more convenient to use, thus increasing patient adherence. The primary difference between injector pens and traditional vial and syringe administration is the easier use of an injector pen by people with low dexterity, poor vision, or who need portability to administer medicine on time. Injector pens also decrease the fear or adversity towards self-injection of medications, which increases the likelihood that a person takes the medication. Injector pens are commonly used for medications that are injected repeatedly by a person over a relatively short period of time, especially insulin and insulin analogs used in the treatment of diabetes (called insulin pens). Many other medications are also available as injector pens, including other injectable medicines for diabetes, high cholesterol, migraine prevention, and other monoclonal antibodies. Studies have shown injector pens to be at least as effective as vial and syringe administration, and surveys have shown that a vast majority of people would prefer an injector pen over vial and syringe administration if one was available. After a slow uptake in the United States, injector pens have surpassed vial and syringe administration of insulin in type 2 diabetes. Uses The primary goal of injector pens is to increase patient adherence by making it easier and more convenient for people to use injectable therapy. This is especially problematic with injectable medications given the extra work associated with an injection, as well as the potential aversion to self- injecting medication. Injector pens increase patient adherence by increasing the ease of self-administering injectable medication, as well as the portability of injection medication. Furthermore, injector pens are easier to handle and use than vials and syringes, making them useful in people with low dexterity, cognitive or visual impairment, or those who worry about being able to properly use a vial and syringe. For medications which do not follow standard dosage in all people, injector pens may be designed to enable easier and more accurate administration of an exact dose, whereas a vial and syringe requires the person to prepare the correct dose themselves. Injector pens may also remove stigma or fear around the use of injection medication in public environments, such as insulin before a meal at a restaurant. Combination injector pens which include multiple medications used to treat a disease are designed to reduce the number of injections a person must use to administer their medications. The reduction in number of injections required may decrease the risk of non-adherence due to forgetfulness or unwillingness to self-inject medication. Design An insulin pen with labels as follows: A) tip; B) medication chamber; C) plunger; D) dose window; E) dose selection dial; F) plunger button An injector pen consists of a chamber or cartridge of medication, a tip to attach a needle, and a piston or plunger to inject the dose. Some pens, including most insulin pens, include dials to adjust the dose of the injection before each administration. Dials enable more accurate dose measuring than traditional vial and syringe administration, especially for low doses of insulin. Injector pens which have dials to adjust dosages may also include a clicking sound or other method to confirm the dose adjustment. Some pens may include a cartridge filled with medication which can be replaced when empty to enable reuse of the pen itself, whereas other pens are designed to be disposed of after their prefilled chamber is depleted. Injector pens designed for single use may also be autoinjectors, which do not require the user to press a plunger to inject the dose. =Pen needles= left All injector pens other than those designed for single use require the use of single-use replaceable pen needles for each injection. These pen needles come in various lengths to accommodate varying depths of subcutaneous tissue under the top of the skin. Pen needles are designed for single use subcutaneous injection of medication and are not designed to be reused for more than one administration. The needles are generally manufactured with an outer protective plastic shell, which is used by a person to attach the needle to the pen, and an inner plastic shell protecting the needle itself. Instruction on how to properly attach and use needles is the responsibility of the doctor or pharmacist to ensure proper use. Today, pen needles are manufactured at shorter needle lengths than required for typical vial and syringe administration, which decreases the pain associated with injection. They are available in multiple lengths and gauge of needle, including 3.5mm, 4mm, 5mm, and 8mm lengths, and 31 through 34 gauge. Over time, needles have also had bevels designed which decrease the force required to penetrate the skin, which decreases the pain associated with injection and may increase the acceptability of self- injection. Furthermore, pen needles are designed for insertion at a 90-degree angle to the skin, as opposed to normal syringes which are designed to be injected at an angle. Pen needles generally do not require pinching of the skin for proper administration, unlike historically used syringes. Pen needles should be disposed of properly after each use, preferably in a purpose-made sharps container, to prevent injury from accidental contact after use. =Comparison to syringe= A standard insulin syringe with needle is smaller than an injector pen. Injector pens are an alternative to the manufacture of medication for injection in vials containing either liquid or a powder to which a diluent such as sterile water is added. When a vial is used as a means of storage, the end-user must use a syringe to \\"draw up\\" or remove the medication from the vial to prepare it for administration. The end user must then perform a series of actions to insert the needle of the syringe under the skin, and depress the plunger on the syringe to inject the dose. This requires dexterity which may make it difficult to accurately or completely administer the appropriate doses of medications. Injector pens remove some of the complications of syringes by allowing the pen to be \\"pushed\\" against the skin at a 90 degree angle (removing the need to inject at a proper angle as is the case with syringes), as well as by replacing a long, thin plunger of a syringe with a simple button which is depressed and held to inject the dose. Availability Many insulin analogs and GLP-1 agonists for diabetes treatment are available as injector pens. As with insulin vials, some insulin pens are made with higher concentrations including U-200, U-300, and U-500. Different concentration insulin products may not have the same pharmacokinetic properties as other strengths. The higher concentrations are used to lessen the volume of the injection, and allow the same dose of insulin to be injected with less force. In some cases, these medications may be combined into one pen to be administered daily, for example insulin degludec with liraglutide and insulin glargine with lixisenatide. Combination products are available in fixed-dose ratios and are generally dosed by units of insulin, which will administer a proportional amount of the GLP-1 agonist as well. Another class of medication commonly available as an injector pen is monoclonal antibodies. Due to the molecular size of monoclonal antibodies, they must be administered via injection. Examples of monoclonal antibodies available or studied as injector pens include adalimumab, secukinumab, and alirocumab. CGRP antagonists which are monoclonal antibodies, used for the prevention of migraines, are also available as injector pens. Other monoclonal antibodies designed for home use may also be manufactured as injector pens. Some medications are formulated as injector pens to quicken the onset of action of the medication. This includes epinephrine, which when used to treat anaphylaxis must work as soon as possible. Contrary to most other injector pens, epinephrine injector pens are designed to administer the medication via intramuscular injection. Another medication formulated as an injector pen to ensure quick onset of action is glucagon for hypoglycemia. Other medications normally administered orally are also available or have been studied as injector pens, either due to different pharmacokinetic properties when administered via injection, or for those who cannot take oral medications. This includes methotrexate for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sumatriptan for treatment of migraines. Effectiveness Most injector pens are designed for subcutaneous injection just under the skin, but some are designed for injection into muscle. The desired injection site and the skin profile at the injection site will determine what needle length is appropriate for a person to use. For products with included needles, such as epinephrine pens, different brands may have different included needle lengths, which must be taken into account. Multiple studies have shown that many people prefer the use of injector pens over other forms of injectable medication, such as vial and syringe. Injector pens in general have also been shown to be at least as effective therapeutically as other injection methods. One study of the use of injector pens for insulin administration found that the chance a person initiated on insulin continued therapy for at least 12 months was higher with insulin pens than with vial and syringe administration. The same study found that the increase in adherence to therapy resulted in increased short-term pharmacy costs (i.e. for the pens/needles) but resulted in an overall decrease in healthcare costs related to diabetes. Insulin pens have also been shown to provide a higher quality of life than traditional injection methods. A 2011 systematic review which examined preference of insulin pens over vial and syringe administration found that in almost all studies and surveys a majority of people preferred insulin pens. The effectiveness of an injector pen can also depend on the technique used to inject. After fully pressing the plunger button to activate the pen, the button must continue to be held for about 10 seconds to ensure the dose is administered before removing the pen needle from the skin and finally releasing the button. Failure to use the pen as instructed may result in medication leakage and administration of a lower dose than was intended. Another administration problem which may impact effectiveness of an injector pen is lipohypertrophy of the subcutaneous tissue near the injection site. For this reason, it is recommended to rotate the injection site every administration. History The first injector pen was introduced in 1985, by Novo Nordisk to administer insulin products. After their introduction, insulin pens had a slow adoption in the United States, with only 2% of insulin being injected via pen in 1999. A major barrier to adoption in the United States was the increased up-front cost of insulin pens compared to traditional injections. Pen adoption in the United States accelerated after studies showed that the higher up-front cost of insulin pens was offset by the increase in compliance, which decreased overall healthcare costs. Historically, pen needles were manufactured in lengths up to 12.7mm. Over time, pen needles designed for insulin pens have become shorter, and it is now thought that a 4mm long needle is sufficient for most people to administer subcutaneously correctly. In 1989, an injector pen form of human growth hormone was licensed in New Zealand. In the US, a pen form of octreotide was approved by the FDA in 2020, under the trade name Byfenzia.

He is the father of Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Early life and career Morrison was born in Waverley, New South Wales, in 1934, the son of Douglas Charles John Morrison (1900-1977) and Gwendoline Noel Webster (1902-1979). On 18 August 1953, Morrison was called up to undertake National Service as a Private in the Australian Army. On 4 January 1954, at the age of 19, Morrison joined the New South Wales Police Force. He married Marion Elsie Smith (b. 1943) on 16 February 1963 in Sydney.NSW Register for Births Deaths and Marriages, BDM Index ref for marriage: 1717/1963. On 31 March 1983, Sergeant 1st Class Morrison was promoted to the commissioned rank of Inspector in the Police Force. Political career Morrison was first elected as an alderman of the Municipality of Waverley in December 1968 as an Independent, being one of the first two policemen in the state elected to such an office, follow a rule change that permitted it in 1964. Morrison only served a single term, leaving the Council in September 1971. He stood for election again in September 1974, and was elected. Morrison spearheaded efforts to limit and manage the levels of development that was occurring in Waverley at the time and was recognised as having saved \\"many of the free-standing homes in Bronte\\". Although elected as an Independent alderman, Morrison was associated with the unofficial 'Liberal' coalition. In September 1984, he was elected to serve a single term as deputy mayor under mayor Ray Collins. On 23 September 1985 he defeated Labor alderman Barbara Armitage to succeed Collins and serve a single term as mayor, with the Sydney Morning Herald noting \\"Alderman Morrison is known for not participating in the often heated debates which have come to characterise the political conflicts on the council. Accusations of inefficiency, lying and personal insults are regularly traded in council by both the left and right. Alderman Morrison acknowledged the deep rift between the seven-member Liberal coalition majority and the five-member Labor team on council but said he hoped that \\"decorum would reign\\".\\" In January 1986 was promoted to the police rank of Chief inspector commanding the No. 10 Division (Woolahra and Waverley) covering the Eastern suburbs. In response to questions of a conflict of interest between his two roles, Morrison noted: \\"The Police have always worked in close co-operation with Waverley Council\\". However his police appointment was appealed by several senior police officers at the Police Appeals Tribunal, which subsequently overturned Morrison's appointment in April 1986. Morrison was later promoted to Chief inspector commanding the No. 15 Division (Maroubra) covering the Eastern and Southeast suburbs. On his time at Council Morrison recalled: \\"I was an independent, I wasn‚Äôt a party man, I managed to get involved in a few things, I saved Bronte from being overdeveloped with high rises, I stopped a huge development which would have changed the social fabric of the whole area.\\" Morrison retired from the Council in September 1987. Later life Morrison continued his service in the Police Force until retirement on 11 May 1992. On 27 August 1993, the NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation, George Souris, appointed Morrison to serve on the Botany General Cemetery and Eastern Suburbs Crematorium Trust. He was reappointed in 1994 and 1999. Reappointed again in 2004, Morrison served as Chairman of the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park Board from 1 January 2005 to 3 August 2012, and led efforts to create and dedicate a Police Memorial in the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park.

Rolls leads a lab that explores how the nervous system affects immune responses and thus physical health. Her recent work has highlighted how the brain‚Äôs reward system is implicated in the placebo response and how brain- immune interactions can be harnessed to find and destroy tumors.  Early life and education  Rolls completed her undergraduate degree in Life Sciences at the Technion within the Israel Institute of Technology. After she obtained a Bachelors of Science, Rolls stayed in the department of Physical Chemistry at the Israel Institute of Technology for her Master‚Äôs. Following her Master‚Äôs, Rolls pursued her graduate studies at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. Rolls pursued research in neuroimmunology under the mentorship Michal Schwartz within the Department of Neuroscience and Ofer Lider in the Department of immunology. Her graduate work focused on exploring how the immune system impacts neurogenesis and brain repair. Rolls explored the role of Toll-like Receptors in neurogenesis and found that TLR2 and TLR4 play opposing roles in the proliferation of new hippocampal neurons. TLR2 seemed to promote neurogenesis and TLR4 seemed to impair neurogenesis, all through MyD88 signalling. Rolls then explored the neurogenesis in pregnancy, to understand by learning and memory impairments are common in pregnant women. Rolls completed her PhD in 2007. In 2008, Rolls received the Fulbright Scholarship which allowed her to pursue her postdoctoral training at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. She worked in the Department of Psychiatry under the mentorship of Luis de Lecea and Craig Heller , exploring the impact of sleep on brain homeostasis and memory. Rolls first used optogenetics to dissect the role of sleep in memory consolidation. By activating orexin neurons optogenetically, Rolls was able to fragment sleep after learning and found that this impacted memory the following day. Interestingly, the memory impairment only occurred if the minimal unit of uninterrupted sleep was below 62% of the normal. Rolls later explored the importance of sleep in fear memory consolidation. She found that specifically preventing protein synthesis during sleep caused decreases in fear memory formation highlighting the role of sleep in memory consolidation. To further show the impact that sleep can have on health, Rolls and her team explored the role of sleep in the engraftment and implantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice. They found that sleep deprivation significantly decreased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling gene which impaired the migration and homing of HSCs. Their findings emphasized the importance of sleep in the success of bone marrow transplantation.  Career and research  In 2012, Rolls was appointed to group leader at the Technion at the Israel Institute of Technology. She is now an assistant professor in the Rappaport Medical School and is the principal investigator of the Rolls Lab. Roll‚Äôs lab explores the connection between the brain and the immune system. She specifically focuses on how the biological mechanisms underlying emotions and cognition affect immune function and physical health. One innovation that the Rolls Lab pioneered is the merging of DREADDs technology with CyTOyF mass-cytometry to enable the high resolution measurements of the immune system after neuronal stimulation and inhibition. Rolls is a member of The Israel Young Academy. = Reward system and immunity = Rolls was one of the first to establish the link between the brain‚Äôs reward system and the immune system. Her interest in this connection came from the placebo effect. The placebo effect works from the cognitive processes generating positive expectations, but how exactly these processes lead to healing or feeling better were unknown. Rolls found that using DREADDs to activate the ventral tegmental area reward circuitry lead to an increase in the innate and adaptive immune responses in mice upon exposure to bacterial insults. Following up this study, Rolls was interested in exploring the role of cognitive processes in tumor immunity. Since regulation of immune function is important in approaching potential treatments for cancer, Rolls explored how the brain‚Äôs reward circuitry was capable of modulating tumor immunity. Strikingly, they found that using DREADDs to activate the brain‚Äôs reward the circuitry lead to decreases in tumor size and that myeloid derived suppressor cells are critical to allowing the reward system to impact tumor growth. = Characterizing immune system in the brain = Rolls has pioneered the use of CyTOF mass cytometry in the characterization of immune cell populations in the brain. She and her team recently characterized previously unknown populations of T, B, Dendritic, and NK Cells in the brain using this method and found that CD44 is a common marker of infiltrating immune cells. Using CyTOF analysis, Rolls and her team found that after sleep deprivation, B cells begin to infiltrate the brain parenchyma, highlighting the impacts of sleep deprivation on the immune environment in the brain.

He acquired the title of Baron Bourchier by right of his wife Elizabeth Bourchier, 4th Baroness Bourchier, and died in battle against the French during the Hundred Years' War. Sir Lewis and his elder brother Jean were the grandsons of Sir Thierry de Robessart, seigneur de d‚ÄôEscaillon, whose family originated from Hainault, where Sir Lewis was born. Thierry was engaged in the service of King Edward III of England, and later married a cousin of Katherine Swynford; he is mentioned in the chronicles of Jean Froissart. He passed on the tradition of service to the English royal family to his son Jean (Lewis's father), who served both Richard II and Henry IV. By 1403 Lewis was fighting in Wales in the retinue of King Henry V, then Prince of Wales. When Henry became king, Lewis was promoted to become an Esquire of the Chamber. He officially became royal standard-bearer in 1420, and continued as a permanent member of the royal household, later becoming Chamberlain to the young King Henry VI. In 1415 he was given the manor of Mapelhurst in Kent and an annuity. For his service, the king later granted him the manor of Postedhalle in Norfolk, one of the properties forfeited by the disgraced Sir John Oldcastle.

Born into a strict middle-class Cuban family, she and her family moved to Miami when Cuba became politically turbulent in the 1920s. Parla began dancing with Don Justo Angel Azpiaz√∫ in 1930 and toured the United States and Europe during the first half of the decade. She taught rhumba to Edward, Prince of Wales at his Monte Carlo villa in 1932 before her European tour ended in 1933. Parla returned to Cuba as per her father's instruction in 1934 and went into a domesticated life. She briefly came back into public view in two films and the occasional nostalgic show. Biography Parla was born in Havana, Cuba in 1914 to a middle-class family. Her father worked as an ophthalmologist, and her uncle was Cuba's first aviator. Parla had one sister, Zilia Navarete. Her mother was strict, warning her daughter from age nine onward almost daily not to marry unless she was no longer a virgin. During her childhood, Parla had the ambition to become a professional rhumba dancer after becoming obsessed with the technique, but her father was against Parla dancing and wanted her to obtain self-sufficiency by becoming a typist and then marrying. In Cuba's 1920s political turbulence where Gerardo Machado became dictator of the country, the family moved to Miami, and Parla was sent to convent school in Key West, while her father remained in Havana. After graduating, Parla and her mother moved to New York, defying her mother's wishes and took a job as a cigarette girl in a night club in Greenwich Village and waiting to attract more attention over other dancers, as she shared the house where she lodged with a dance school. She agreed not to tell her father about her job and allowed her mother to work as a on-the-job chaperone and threatening to kill herself. Parla's job gave her the confidence to audition in the presence of director of the Havana Casino Orchestra Don Justo Angel Azpiaz√∫, after the club's Spanish dancer felt unwell. Out of 150 candidates held at an audition at the Paramount Theatre, she won the audition to be part of Azpiatz√∫'s dance team because of \\"her gyrating hips\\". Parla was due to be paired with a male dancer but she demanded to Azpiatz√∫ that she dance the rumba alone after she declared one of the candidate's uncoordinated. She said, \\"The rumba is very sexual, and I didn't like doing it with a partner.\\" Parla and the group toured New York in 1930, becoming a success with her \\"sexually suggestive rumba act\\". The following year, she toured the United States to demonstrate her technique, before moving to Europe with her mother to tour with the group in 1932. During an engagement in Monte Carlo, Parla attracted the attention of Edward, Prince of Wales and his brother Albert, Duke of York. Edward summoned Parla to his villa the next day to teach him the rhumba. On Bastille Day on July 14, 1932, she descended a stairwell draped in Cuba's red, white and blue colors, causing the French to mistake her patriotism of her homeland as a gesture to their own national holiday and earning her praise with shouts of \\"Vive La France\\". This led \\"Mariana scarfs\\" copied from her costume to go on sale in chic French stores, along with casseroles, cocktails and perfumes named after her, and taught Josephine Baker the rhumba. Parla then went to Brussels, where Leopold of Belgium was so taken with her rhumba that he provided her with a large enough box of chocolates that she stepped on it. She returned to the United States via the SS √éle de France in November 1933. Parla spent 1934 dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, before complying with the wishes of her father at the end of the year to return to Havana and marry a millionaire rancher. Life living on a Cuban became too domesticated as a housewife and mother and she exchanged marriage for a return to public view. In 1935, Parla received an appointment to teach Edward the cucaracha in London, and said wanted Edward to visit Havana. She became friends with Ernest Hemingway, and featured in two films in Mexico, The Angry God and The Black Privateer, along with multiple documentaries. After Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959, Parla and her family fled to the United States and settled in Miami, working as a hospital administrator and typist at Victoria Hospital before retiring 20 years later, with the occasional appearance in nostalgia shows. Personal life Parla was married three times. Her first marriage to millionaire rancher Antonio Fuello resulted in a daughter before they divorced. Parla's second marriage, to jai alai player Guillermo Amuchastegui who toured the globe in the 1940s, also ended in divorce. She was lastly married to Armando Gali-Menendez, a senior Cuban Revolutionary Army officer serving under the rule of Fulgencio Batista, He predeceased Parla. She died from cancer on the night of October 6, 1998 in Miami.  Reception and legacy  Orlando Gonz√°lez Esteva, a historian, called her \\"a fabulous story of Cuban music\\", and several publications termed her \\"the Queen of Rumba\\". Walter Winchell, the journalist, called Parla \\"that lovely Havana torso flipper\\".

Since his death, his reputation has been based primarily on his portraits. Other favourite subjects included still lifes of flowers and landscapes featuring the hill country and forests of south-west Germany. Readers of the (by English standards rather mildly) satirical magazine Fliegende Bl√§tter were also able to enjoy his line drawings during the early decades of the twentieth century.  Life  Hans Brasch was born in Karlsruhe. He was one of four siblings, but the others were all girls. His father - another Johannes Brasch - was a painter and decorator who also produced stage sets for the city theatre and was in addition a talented amateur producer of his own works. His talents were acknowledged and appreciated in and around Karlsruhe. The father had very firmly held views about the path that his son's career should follow: little Hans should prepare to take over his father's business. The father would be disappointed. He attended school locally and then moved on to the city's Applied Arts College (\\"Kunstgewerbeschule\\") - then a separate institution) which he attended between 1898 and 1900. In defiance of his father's wishes he then moved on to the Academy of Fine Arts (\\"Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste \\") where he was a student between 1900 and 1906. His teachers included Ludwig Schmid-Reutte and Friedrich Fehr. Between 1904 and 1908 he was in addition picked out as a \\"Meistersch√ºler\\" of the Academy Director, Hans Thoma. Despite the amount of energy he seems to have devoted to fights with his strong-willed father over the direction of his career, by this time he had picked up a range of excellent technical skills, appropriate both to his father's business and to his own preference for a career as a \\"fine-arts\\" freelancer, which would stand him in good stead during his subsequent career. After 1908 he undertook his own intensive study of the \\"old masters\\", copying many of them in order to gather technical insights. During 1910 there was a brief but exceptionally important period during which he worked with the Geneva-based artist Ferdinand Hodler, with whom he undertook several painting trips in the mountains, followed by a study trip to Paris. There followed several years working successively in Mannheim, Heidelberg and on the shores of Lake Constance before he settled in 1913 to an established career as a free-lance artist in Frankfurt. He very quickly established himself as a sought after portrait artist and a respected painter more broadly. War broke out in July 1914. Brasch spent the next four years serving in the army. When the nightmare ended he found it hard to resume his interrupted artistic development. Still in Frankfurt, he teamed up with August Babberger and Rudolf Gudden: the three shared a studio. Keen to recover his artistic momentum Brasch now turned to Goethe's Theory of Colours and the Anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner. In 1920, with the help of Rudolf Gudden, he acquired an ancient farmstead at Urberg, a short distance beyond Sankt Blasien on the southern fringes of the Black Forest where he was able to progress his studies, while also intensively and exhaustively observing nature through the prisms of his newly acquired insights. Till now the focus of Brasch's work had been on portraiture and oil paintings, but as the 1920s opened up he became, in addition, a painter of flowers, forests and hillscapes. He turned increasingly to watercolors, no doubt attracted by the relative portability of the necessary equipment and supplies when traipsing past hillside meadows, but also attracted by the atmosphere and textures possible with the medium, along with the more nimble use of colour which his works from the period demonstrate. His canvases from this period use only \\"Japanese\\" Washi paper, which facilitated the delicacy and precision associated with the artists' work. He continued to be relatively catholic in respect of modality and subject matter, however. One piece which resonated powerfully with contemporary art lovers and the wider public ever since is his 1925/26 mural construct for the unusual entrance hall (more recently deployed as a restaurant) at Bad Orb's remarkable railway station. He used the generous space availability to include a depiction of the seasons, of the thermal springs (from which presumably many of the train travellers had come to receive their cures) and of the townsfolk at their jobs and professions. In 1930, Hans Brasch left the idyllic Black Forest countryside and returned to city life. The city in question, this time, was Stuttgart. During the 1930s he produced a number of large wall paintings and window glass images in public buildings. He also took a prominent part in the cultural life of Stuttgart. All this meant that he enjoyed a heightened public profile. At the start of 1933 the Hitler government took power and rapidly transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. There is little indication that Brasch had ever shown much interest in politics. Nevertheless, in 1937 the authorities declared that his art was \\"degenerate\\". Those of his works on display in public museums were confiscated and removed. He continued to work on perfecting his paintings, however, and exhibiting his works in non-public galleries both in Germany and abroad. Hans Brasch died at Murrhardt, a short distance outside Stuttgart, on 13 May 1973, approximately six weeks after his ninety-first birthday.

Earlier in its career as the MV Helgoland it served as a hospital ship during the Vietnam War from 1966 to 1971. History The ship was built in 1963 for the HADAG shipping company at the Howaldtswerke Hamburg AG shipyard as a sea-going ship and operated until 1965 on the Cuxhaven-Helgoland line. In this function, it replaced the Bunte Kuh (1957) and was replaced in 1966 by Alte Liebe. From 1963 to 1965, it was chartered several times outside of the summer season to Stena Line for service between Gothenburg and Frederikshavn and between Stockholm and Mariehamn. =Vietnam War= Helgoland hospital ship in Da Nang, January 1970 From 1966, HADAG chartered Helgoland to the German Red Cross, which, after extensive renovations, commissioned the ship on behalf of the West German government as a floating hospital, officially known as the Helgoland hospital ship, in South Vietnam. Helgoland had 150 beds for inpatient care, three operating theaters and four specialist departments (surgery, internal medicine, gynecology and radiology). The medical staff included 8 doctors, 4 medical technicians, 4 administrators and 18 nurses. The 30-strong crew consisted of captain, nautical officers, ship engineers, electricians, radio operators, carpenters, sailors and cooks. In order to ensure special protection as a civilian hospital in an armed conflict, an agreement was concluded between the West German and South Vietnamese governments on 18 May 1966 governing the operation of the hospital ship. The German Red Cross \\"dispatched a Red Cross hospital ship with civilian personnel in agreement with the government of the Republic of Vietnam \\" (Article 1). The ship received a certificate from the South Vietnamese government, which classed it as a civil hospital within the meaning of Articles 18 to 20 of the IV Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Article 4, Paragraph 2); the Red Cross armbands and ID cards to be worn by the ship's personnel were stamped by the Republic of Vietnam (Art. 12, Paragraph 2). The ship was marked with the Red Cross protection symbol and the staff wore the German Red Cross's official clothing during the service (Article 4, Paragraph 1); the ship was exempt from any searches or seizures (Article 4, Paragraph 3). Due to the fact that it was classified as a civilian hospital and not as a hospital ship (in accordance with Article 25 of the II Geneva Conventions), no notifications between the parties to the conflict were required. Nevertheless, the International Committee of the Red Cross formally informed the parties involved in the conflict about the ship's duties. On 10 August 1966, Helgoland set sail for Saigon arriving on 3 October 1966. More than 21,000 out-patient treatments were given to approximately 6,700 patients from September 1966 until 30 June 1967. Over 850 major surgical cases were also treated. On 12 September 1967 Helgoland moved to Da Nang. 54 doctors and 160 nurses worked on Helgoland during the course of the mission. A total of 11,000 inpatients and 200,000 outpatient treatments were performed, the treatments were free for patients who were all civilians. The mission was funded by the West German government with running costs of about $2.5 million a year. Helgoland remained at Da Nang until 31 December 1971 when it was replaced by a new 170 bed hospital ashore, operated by the Maltese Aid Service and financed by the West German government. The medical equipment from Helgoland was passed to three South Vietnamese hospitals, a local leper colony and the Maltese Hospital. In order to take up supplies from a German supply ship, Helgoland had to go into international waters as the supply ship was not allowed to dock in Danang for insurance reasons. =Baltic Sea= As Baltic Star, 1987 HADAG sold the ship to Stena Reederei GmbH in Kiel and in 1972 commissioned a new sea-going ship under the name Helgoland. The former Helgoland was renamed Stena Finlandica and ran regular services between Stockholm and Mariehamn, as well as between Kiel and Kors√∏r. In 1975 the ship was chartered to F√∂rde Reederei Seetouristik GmbH L√ºbeck and renamed Baltic Star. Under this name it served between Travem√ºnde and R√∏dbyhavn in Denmark. In 1976 it was sold to the KG Seetouristik in Flensburg and in 1977 L√ºbeck became its home port. From 1987 it was also used between Travem√ºnde and Warnem√ºnde. In 1993 it was purchased by F√∂rde Reederei Seetouristik GmbH and made \\"Butter Cruises\\" on the Baltic Sea until 1999 with a capacity of 1,500 passengers. =Galapagos= In 2000 the ship was sold to Latin Cruises in George Town, Cayman Islands and conversion to a cruise ship followed. Renamed the Galapagos Legend, the ship cruised around the Galapagos Islands carrying up to 100 passengers. In 2002, the Galapagos Legend was placed under the Georgian flag. In 2006 it was sold to the Galatours shipping company in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Accommodative excess has traditionally been defined as accommodation that is persistently higher than expected for the patient's age. Modern definitions simply regard it as an inability to relax accommodation readily. Excessive accommodation is seen in association with excessive convergence also. Symptoms and signs * Blurring of vision due to pseudomyopia * Headache * Eye strain * Asthenopia * Trouble concentrating when reading CausesCauses related to refractive errors= Accommodative excess may be seen in following conditions. * Hypermetropia: Young hypermetropes use excessive accommodation as a physiological adaptation in the interest of clear vision. * Myopia: Young myopes performing excessive near work may also use excessive accommodation in association with excessive convergence * Astigmatism: Astigmatic eye may also be associated with accommodative excess * Presbyopia: Early presbyopic eye may also induce excessive accommodation * Improper or ill fitting spectacles: Use of improper or ill fitting spectacles may also cause use of excessive accommodation. =Causes related to systemic drugs= Use of systemic drugs like Morphine, Digitalis, Sulfonamides, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may cause accommodative excess. =Causes related to diseases= *Unilateral excessive accommodation-Trigeminal neuralgia, and head trauma may cause ciliary spasm and may cause accommodative excess. *Bilateral excessive accommodation-Diseases like Encephalitis, Syphilis, Head trauma, Influenza, Meningitis may cause ciliary spasm and bilateral excessive accommodation. =Secondary to Convergence insufficiency= Accommodative excess may occur secondary to convergence insufficiency also. In convergence insufficiency near point of convergence will recede, and positive fusional vergence (PFV) will reduce. So, the patient use execessive accommodation to stimulate accommodative convergence to overcome reduced PFV. Risk factors A large amount of near work is the main precipitating factor of accommodative excess. Pseudomyopia Pseudomyopia also known as artificial myopia refers to an intermittent and temporary shift in refractive error of the eye towards myopia. It may occur due to excessive accommodation or spasm of accommodation. DiagnosisDifferential diagnosis= Parinaud‚Äôs syndrome, which can mimic some aspects of spasm of the near reflex, such as excessive accommodation and convergence; however, pupillary near-light dissociation, not miosis, is a feature of Parinaud‚Äôs syndrome.

It seeks to explain that socialism in North Korea will be unaffected by the fall of communism elsewhere because it is based on the Juche ideology. History Kim Jong-il gave the talk Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish on May 5, 1991 to \\"senior officials of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea\\". The context of the speech was the then- ongoing processes of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, economic reform in China, and problems facing socialism in Cuba and North Korea. A few years later, in 1994, the premise of the speech that continuity of socialism in North Korea seems under jeopardy was further accentuated by the death of Kim Il-sung. Against this background, the speech was \\"a bold defiance of global historical trends\\". According to Kim, North Korea will not be affected by the fall of communism because North Korean socialism is of a different kind. This, Kim says, is because of its rootedness in the Juche ideology. This makes it a more authentic, and thus more enduring, socialism. Considered authoritative on Juche, the work contains no reformulation of the ideology and instead restates what was by then a standard account of its contents. Its treatment of the subject is, according to Daniel Kalder, highly solipsistic. The work makes little reference to things that stand outside the framework of the philosophical system of Juche. According to Kalder, \\"practically every sentence contains a lie\\", like the assessment that North Korea has \\"the best of all social systems\\" that cherishes human life and guarantees human rights. Kalder describes the work as unoriginal, part of a repetitive, self- referential \\"superspeech\\" of North Korean propaganda texts that is continuously generated. In this respect, he compares it to the works of Joseph Stalin. With Kim claiming to speak for \\"the masses\\" without actually giving them a voice of their own, Kalder sees a parallel with John Berger's social photo-essay A Seventh Man. Although at about 45 pages it is a relatively short treatise, its prompt publication in a separate pamphlet form testifies that the speech is of importance to North Korea. North Korea used the work to tighten its grip on the populace by claiming that the United States was pursuing regime change by collapsing socialist states from within. One theme of the work is multilateralism. It is one of the earliest works of Kim Jong-il that contains a discussion of it (dabangmyeonjeokin gyoryu, \\"multilateral exchange\\"). According to Kim, such exchanges are only possible with countries that consider North Korea their equal, have a friendly disposition, and can offer mutual benefits. This formulation has since become common in North Korean media. The message of multilateralism is particularly aimed at developing countries, especially those in Africa with which North Korea had already cooperated in the past. It has been published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House in English, Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. An English reprint is also available by the University Press of the Pacific.

Its highest point is above sea level. The River Bradford flows along the northern edge of the moor past Youlgreave and into the River Lathkill at Alport. Harthill Moor is a rich prehistoric landscape with several protected Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The rock of Harthill Moor and nearby Stanton Moor is known as Ashover Grit, an outlier of Millstone Grit. This is a coarse-grained sandstone which weathers to produce coarse sub-soils, rich in sand, and the soils themselves are typically podzols. The Ashover Grit sandstone layer lies on top of shale, which in turn lie upon Carboniferous limestone. Robin Hood's Stride (also called Mock Beggar Hall) is a prominent natural rock formation with distinctive pinnacle towers. Prehistoric rock art has been found on and close to the gritstone outcrop. It is a popular location for bouldering and limited short climbing is possible on Weasel pinnacle and Inaccessible pinnacle. Nearby Cratcliffe Tor provides more challenging rock climbing, with over 200 graded routes. Hermit's Cave at Cratcliff Rocks Cratcliff Rocks is an extensive rock outcrop on the edge of Harthill Moor in the eastern gritstone moors of Derbyshire. Cratcliff Rocks defended settlement is an ancient encosure in the field to the north east of Robin Hood's Stride. The monument lies on the western edge of the Cratcliff Rocks outcrop and is in the form of a round enclosure about 100m wide with a 5m wide ditch cut into the rock. Several building platforms have been identified inside the enclosure. Whilst the site has not been excavated, it is considered to be linked to the other Bronze Age features of Harthill Moor. Cratcliff Rocks hermitage is a medieval hermit's cave. The rock shelter has a number of recesses cut into the walls for candles and sacred objects. A bas-relief crucifix carved in the cave has been dated to the 13th or 14th century. On the rock face outside the shelter, chiselled grooves and sockets for timber beams indicate where the roof structure was of a building adjoining the cave. Nine Stones Close Nine Stones Close is a Bronze Age stone circle about 30m across, with four remaining upright stones about 2m high. Several original stones were removed in the 18th and 19th centuries, one of which stands in a field wall 70m to the south where it was taken to be used as a gatepost. Partial excavations of the circle were conducted by Thomas Bateman in 1847, Jewitt and Greenwell in 1877 and J P Heathcote in 1939. Many Bronze Age flints and pot-sherds were discovered. Doll Tor stone circle lies about east of Nine Stones Close. A further north east is Nine Ladies stone circle on Stanton Moor. The Castle Ring defended settlement (immediately north of Harthill Moor Farm) now consists of an oval earthwork ditch (about 5m wide and 100m across) with inner and outer banks, up to 2m high. It hasn't been excavated but it is considered to be an integral part of the Bronze Age landscape of Harthill Moor. Harthill Moor bowl barrow is a Bronze Age burial mound about 150m SE of Harthill Moor Farm. It is 20m long and 11m wide. It was partially excavated in 1877 by Jewitt and Greenwell. A limestone cist was found with the remains from two cremations. The Derbyshire Portway prehistoric road runs across Harthill Moor in a north-south direction. It passes between Robin Hood's Stride and Cratcliff Rocks and past Nine Stones Close. It was an ancient route between Mam Tor in the Peak District to the Hemlock Stone near Nottingham. The Limestone Way long distance footpath follows the Derbyshire Portway route across Harthill Moor but then heads around the Castle Ring earthwork towards Youlgreave. Harthill Hall, on the northern edge of the moor near Alport, is the manor of a great 13th-century estate. The 16th-century manor house, farm house and 14th-century chapel still stand. Harthill was recorded as Hortel and Hortil in the Domesday Book, as part of the lands of the Norman knights Henry de Ferrers and Ralph FitzHubert.

The line runs between the communes of Saint-Louis and Huningue. As of 2020, the line is closed to passenger service but is still used by freight trains. It consists of line number 136 000 of the r√©seau ferr√© national. In the old nomenclature of the east region of the SNCF, the line was amalgamated with the Waldighoffen‚ÄìSaint-Louis-La Chauss√©e railway. As a result, it was numbered 31.8 and referred to as the Blotzheim‚ÄìHuningue railway.  History  The Saint-Louis au Rhin railway was opened on 11 February 1878 and was prolonged along the Rhine river to Weil am Rhein. Envisioned since the early 1870s, the line responded to a military need as it allowed for the rapid deployment of military personnel towards the Sundgau. Due to limited demand for passenger and freight service, the railway bridge in Huningue across the Rhine was removed in 1937. The line was subsequently closed to passenger services on 31 December 1945.

This therapy was developed at Tel Aviv University in Israel, by Professors Itzhak Kelson and Yona Keisari. The treatment is delivered by the intratumoral insertion of metal tubes called ‚Äúseeds‚Äù, which have Radium-224 atoms fixed to their surface. When the radium decays, its short-lived daughter Radon-220 is released from the seed through recoil energy. The daughters of Radon-220, in particular Pb-212, disperse in the tumor, and emit high-energy alpha particles, which destroy the tumor. Because the alpha-emitting atoms diffuse only a few millimeters in tissue, the DaRT eradicates the tumor cells and spares the surrounding healthy tissue. Alpha radiation Alpha radiation is a nuclear phenomenon in which a heavy radionuclide emits an energetic alpha particle (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) and transmutes to a different radionuclide. The emitted alpha particle has a range in tissue of only 40-90 microns, which minimizes collateral damage when used for treatment purposes. However, this also limits its ability to destroy tumors that are many millimeters in diameter. Alpha radiation possesses a potent cell-killing capability because it has a high linear energy transfer (LET) which translates into a high Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). =Treatment of cancer= The invention of DaRT makes possible the use of alpha radiation for treating solid tumors, because it overcomes the range limitation of alpha particles in tissue. The daughter atoms of Radium-224 can each diffuse several millimeters in tumor tissue, while emitting alpha particles. The tumor-killing capability of DaRT comes mainly from the ability of alpha radiation to irreparably break the double stranded DNA in tumor cells. This capability does not seem to be dependent on the stage of the cell cycle or the level of oxygenation of the cancer cell. Preclinical studies in multiple tumor types Preclinical studies have demonstrated that DaRT can effectively damage all solid tumor types. Studies of 10 different tumor types in mice demonstrated that all responded to DaRT. Combination therapy of DaRT with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy In preclinical studies, DaRT effectiveness was enhanced when combined with standard chemotherapies such as 5-FU. In addition, DaRT was able to turn the tumor into its own vaccine and stimulate a systemic anti-tumor immune response. This immune response was effectively augmented by addition of immunostimulants and/or inhibitors of immunosuppressive cells. This immune effect was observed not only as enhanced local tumor destruction at the primary tumor site, but also by elimination of tumor metastases in the lungs. These results suggest that DaRT combined with immunotherapy induces a tumor- specific systemic immune response. Treatment of solid tumors in human patients with DaRT The first results of the DaRT in human patients, from a pilot study of 28 patients by Prof. Popovtzer (Israel) and Dr. Bellia (Italy), were published in 2020. From among this cohort of elderly patients (median age, 80.5 years), 61% had recurrent and previously treated tumors, including 42% who were radioresistant from prior therapy. Patients were diagnosed with histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or head and neck. One-hundred percent of tumors responded to DaRT, with complete responses occurring in greater than 78% of cases, and no major toxicity was noted. Thirty days after treatment, there was no measurable radioactivity in the blood or urine of patients. Additional studies in larger populations are now ongoing to strengthen support regarding the safety and effectiveness of this technique of intratumoral alpha radiation-based tumor ablation.

It frequently hosts cabaret events, Broadway-style shows, dance parties and drag performances. Celebrities, especially Broadway actors, often make pop-up appearances there. The club opened in 2017 and is co-owned by actor Alan Cumming and promoter Daniel Nardicio, who founded it with the owners of the space's previous establishment. The bar was ordered to temporarily halt its shows in 2018, when it was discovered that its liquor license did not include a provision for live entertainment. The matter was resolved swiftly and with community support. Club Cumming has generally been well received by critics, who cite the venue's eclectic entertainment repertoire, its inclusivity and the spontaneity of its atmosphere. Description Club Cumming's facade is made of black painted wood, and it is not marked by any signage on the street. The interior is more lavish, containing chandeliers, velvet drapes, and murals painted by the husband of Alan Cumming, who is the venue's namesake and one of its owners. One of the murals features Nashom Wooden, a longtime staple of the New York City queer nightlife scene, alongside Daniel Nardicio, a local promoter who is also co- owner of the bar. Of Club Cumming's clientele, The New York Times said, \\"On a recent Saturday night, the crowd was a tightly packed mix of neighborhood gay men in vintage T-shirts brushing up against Becky types in black and gender- non-conforming millennials wearing glittery tanks, colorful scarves and the occasional boa. It was sometimes hard to tell where the show ends and the audience begins.\\" Gothamist describes the club as \\"a genuine hybrid of disco dance party and live music performance cabaret\\". Every night features at least one event, among the most common of which are live music, DJ sets, lounge acts, drag shows, go-go dancing and \\"raunchy readings\\". On occasion, the venue also hosts classical music performances and Broadway acts, including some off- off-Broadway musicals. In addition to live entertainment, the bar used to host a weekly knitting circle called \\"Stitch and Bitch\\". It also holds book clubs, piano nights and a \\"gender-fluid dance party\\" called \\"Femme\\". Cumming lives nearby and stops in frequently; he is known to perform, tend bar, DJ, and mingle with the crowd when he does. While mobile devices are not prohibited inside, he discourages their use \\"to make people talk to each other instead of looking at their phones\\". Club Cumming is a popular stop for celebrities who visit New York City, and Broadway actors frequent the venue on Mondays, when their plays typically do not run. Journalist and performer Michael Musto sometimes sings cabaret-style duets with artists like Bridget Everett and Amber Martin at the club. History Alan Cumming founded Club Cumming in his Broadway dressing room. While appearing in Cabaret on Broadway in 2014, Cumming ran a makeshift nightclub called Club Cumming in his dressing room. He later hosted pop-up versions of the club in cities around the United States and in his native Scotland. In early 2017, Cumming and Nardicio bought out the owners of an existing bar, the Eastern Bloc, in Manhattan's East Village. They partnered with that venue's proprietors, Darren Dryden and Ben Maisani, to renovate the space and open a new establishment. Cumming's vision was for it to be a brick-and-mortar version of Club Cumming; he said he wanted it to be \\"a home for everyone of all ages, all genders, all sexualities, who all enjoy letting go and making some mischief. No judgments, no attitude, no rules, except kindness, acceptance and fun.\\" The neon sign bearing the club's name, which now hangs above its stage, is from his Broadway dressing room. Due to Cumming's high profile, Club Cumming began attracting press months before its debut. The week it opened in September 2017, Paul McCartney, Emma Stone and Cumming gave an impromptu performance of \\"Part of Your World\\" while spending an evening there. Since then, figures including Justin Vivian Bond, Billie Jean King, Adele, Jennifer Lawrence and Vanessa Williams have also made appearances. To support Club Cumming performers and staff out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cumming organized the Club Cumming Community Chest. It is a fundraiser in which celebrities give memorabilia or a Zoom call to the highest bidder, and the proceeds go to club employees. During the June 2020 George Floyd protests in New York City, the venue operated as a safe haven for Black Lives Matter protestors, providing them shelter, first aid, and supplies such as water and personal protective equipment. Cumming donated a portion of the Community Chest's funds to Black Lives Matter, and the club, which was not in the direct path of any protests, also stored supplies for demonstrators. The bar's manager, Samuel Benedict, said, \\"We've always had signs that say 'resist,' so us opening up our lobby for protests made sense for a lot of the patrons that our establishment attracts.\\" =Licensing incident= In February 2018, it came to light that Club Cumming had not acquired permission to host live events, and it was ordered to halt its shows. This was due to what Nardicio called \\"a rookie mistake\\": when he and Cumming had applied for the bar's liquor license, they had done so as an establishment without live entertainment. The state liquor authority received complaints from the local community board, and the authority charged Club Cumming with failure to conform. Cumming and Nardicio suspended the club's non-compliant events, and they asked fans and the bar's neighbors to show support by signing a petition, e-mailing the community board, or attending a board meeting. On April 9, members of the community came out \\"in droves\\" to one such meeting; Bedford+Bowery reported that more than a dozen people spoke on Club Cumming's behalf and that the room was so crowded that people were asked to wait outside the building. After hearing this testimony, the community board voted unanimously to extend the bar's licensing to cover live events, with the stipulation that such events not be ticketed or charge cover fees. Reception Club Cumming has been well received by both the public and the nightlife industry; in 2019, it won the title of Best Bar at the Glam Awards, an annual ceremony √† la the Oscars for queer entertainers, promoters and venues in New York City. Gothamist wrote that the club \\"fills a niche that has been slowly eaten away by rising rents and sanitized street corners. Club Cumming attempts to fill the gap with a bit of imagination, served up with just the right amount of polish/un-polish.\\" The New Yorker praised the bar for its inclusivity, stating that \\"[t]he tiny space welcomes a far broader spectrum of the queer community [than most queer nightlife venues] and overflows with a sense of inclusive camaraderie.\\" That publication also noted a selection of events that had recently occurred at the club and complimented the spontaneity they injected into its atmosphere. Caroline Framke of Variety said, \\"The East Village bar reflects its owner's wonderfully bizarre taste.\\" A GrandLife.com review reads, \\"No matter the night's curation, you're sure to have a wild time.\\" See also * LGBT culture in New York City  References External links * Category:2017 establishments in New York City Category:East Village, Manhattan Category:LGBT culture in New York City Category:LGBT drinking establishments in New York (state) Category:Nightclubs in New York City ","title":"Club Cumming"},{"id":"64086013","text":"Salmon 3D is an upcoming multilingual 3D film made in seven Indian languages directed by Shalil Kallur.

It was released beginning January 9, 2020 on RKK TV, and on various streaming platforms for free.  Plot  Natsuna Keyaki, a post-secondary student living in Tokyo, is contacted by her old friend Itsuki Kusunoki from Kumamoto through an on-line game platform, who she hasn't heard from for 4 years. Unfortunately, whilst Itsuki is responding to Natsuna's reply, the platform abruptly shuts down, leaving them with no way to communicate with each other. Feeling a responsibility to her friend, she leaves for Kumamoto to see her. When she arrives at Itsuki's last known address, however, she finds that it is now an empty plot of land. Natsuna calls on the nearest police station, meeting with constable Masayoshi Maezono. Masayoshi and Natsuna head to the town hall to ask for information, but the latter is unable to give out any information, citing privacy legislation. Walking back from town hall, Masayoshi and Natsuna are accosted by Izumi Chiba, a lower secondary student who Masayoshi is acquainted with. Izumi takes Natsuna to a pathway by the canal to meet her friends, reasoning they could help her find Itsuki. Whilst Izumi's friends turn out not to know who Itsuki is, Natsuna stays and has some fun with them, smashing watermelons and accidentally falling into the canal. Izumi takes Natsuna to her family's shop, which doubles as a house, and introduces Natsuna to her father Shigezo Chiba. After taking a bath, Natsuna is invited to drink by Shigezo; she can't hold her liquour. Izumi's mother, Sayuri Chiba, introduces herself to Natsuna, and says she knows of an Itsuki Kusunoki. However, she doesn't know where they are living now; their previous dwelling-place was severely damaged by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. Natsuna is dropped off at her hotel room by the Chibas, and whilst sleeping, dreams of her drawing together with Itsuki in their in- game bodies. The dream quickly turns into a nightmare as Itsuki crumbles and the earthquakes strike, and Natsuna awakes and cries. In the morning, Natsuna heads to a pier to clear her head as Izumi joins her with two noodle bowls; she has another flash-back to her time with Itsuki. Natsuna is snapped out of her daydream by an old lady who owns a candy store; she mistook Natsuna for another girl, and tells her that a girl used to paint at the very same spot. What's more, she has one of her paintings - which the girl said was of her hometown. Natsuna and Izumi suspect that this girl is actually Itsuki, but the lady does not know where she's gone. Sakitsu, where Itsuki and her grandmother live. Natsuna heads back to the Chibas' place to contemplate this along with Izumi, when the latter tells her that she's romantically interested in Masayoshi. Izumi tells her about the things that have changed since the earthquakes, prompting Natsuna to hug her as Shigezo walks in with another bottle of liquour; Shigezo mistakes this gesture for yuri. Out of the corner of her eye, Izumi notices a signature on the painting; the painter girl is indeed Itsuki. Sayuri recognises the view in the painting as being that of Sakitsu, a fishing village in Amakusa. As she rides the bus there, Natsuna contemplates how she just stopped communicating with Itsuki shortly after the earthquakes; rationalising she was busy with school after telling her she was well. In Sakitsu, Natsuna asks around, finding a spot that she recognises from Itsuki's paintings. There, she happens to run into Haru Kusunoki, Itsuki's grandmother. Haru says that Itsuki is well, but that Itsuki has had problems adapting to things after the earthquakes, and that she rarely wants to see anyone. However, Haru does point her towards a wharf where Itsuki likes to linger. On the wharf, Natsuna encounters a grey-haired girl drawing the evening landscape. The girl says she is not Itsuki, but that she is her school-mate. Natsuna tells her about a promise they'd made together to draw Kumamoto landscapes, and the girl says Itsuki is in France studying art, and that she'd be back by summer's end. Natsuna asks the girl to tell Itsuki about her promise, and leaves. Natsuna prepares to leave for Tokyo as the Chibas meet her to drop her off at Kumamoto Airport. On the way to the airport, she reflects how fun her stay in Kumamoto had turned out to be, and as they are met by Masayoshi at the airport to send her off, Izumi tearfully hugs Natsuna good-bye. As she checks in for her flight, Natsuna realises that the girl at the wharf must have been Itsuki, and runs out of the airport - getting Masayoshi to drive her back towards Sakitsu. On the highway, Masayoshi's DeLorean breaks down, leaving Natsuna to run for it. At the wharf, she finds the girl there and apologises for not noticing earlier. The girl continues to deny that she is Itsuki, until Natsuna affirms their friendship and that she wanted to say so in person. Itsuki says that she hurt her hand in the earthquake, and couldn't resume drawing until she'd come to Sakitsu to convalesce at her grandmother's place. Itsuki thought she hated her because their comms had cut off. Natsuna assures her that it is not the case, and Itsuki asks for them to draw together - as they tearfully reunite.

The assistant can perform day-to-day tasks, which include, making a phone call, setting a reminder and checking the weather. It was unveiled on 7 April 2020 and got released to the public on 27 April 2020 via an OTA update solely to selected devices that can update their software to EMUI 10.1. Huawei had initially made reference to the new assistant in late 2019 by having announced that there would be an English version of their already Chinese speaker assistant - Xiaoyi - to be released into the European markets. Due to the aftermath of the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, the company's newly released smartphones were left without a virtual assistant. This subsequently lead to the development and release of Celia. AI technology is integrated into the software of Celia, which allows her to translate text using a phones camera and to identify everyday objects - similar to that of Google Lens.  Features  Celia has many features that are similar to that of its rivals, who are, the Google Assistant and Siri. She can be triggered by the words, 'Hey Celia' or be summoned by pressing and holding down on the power button. The default search engine for Celia is Bing, but this can be changed in settings. Celia can make calls, check the agenda, send a message, show the weather, set alarms and control home appliances. The assistant also has the ability to integrate itself with the stock apps of the EMUI software and toggle with the device's settings, such as by turning on the flashlight and playing multimedia content, but with the users command. With the AI that is installed in Celia, she can identify food, everyday objects and translate text using the phones camera.  Availability by country and language  Currently, Celia is only available in English, French and Spanish and has only been released in the UK, France, Spain, Chile, Mexico and Columbia. Huawei has said that there will be more regions and languages to come.  Compatible devices  Celia only became available with the EMUI 10.1 update that was released in April, which means that a limited amount of devices are compatible with her. More devices will be added to the list throughout the coming months as Celia's availability increases. The current list of devices are the: = Huawei P series = * Huawei P40 (Lite, Pro & Pro+) *Huawei P30 and Pro) = Huawei Mate series = *Huawei Mate 30 (Lite, Pro & RS Porche Design) * Huawei MatePad Pro *Huawei Mate 20 (Pro, 20X 4G, 20X 5G and RS Porche Design) *Huawei Mate X & Xs * =Huawei Nova series= *Huawei Nova 6 (Nova 6 5G & Nova 6 SE) *Huawei Nova 5 (Nova 5 Pro, Nova 5i Pro & Nova 5Z) =Huawei Enjoy series= * Huawei Enjoy 10S  Issues  Technology reviewer, Engadget, has noted that when saying, 'Hey Celia', out aloud in the presence of an iPhone, Siri will respond along with Celia, but this is probably due to the fact that the pronunciation for 'Celia' is similar to that of 'Siri'.

F. Lester. Background Deptford, Foreign Cattle Market, near the Slaughter Houses c. 1905 Horace Francis Lester was born in 1853 in Bombay. He was the son of Frederic William Lester, who was a Major-general of the Bombay Artillery. Lester attended the University College in Oxford, and became a barrister-at-law in 1879. Professionally, he made several legal writings, and was a contributor to the weekly satire magazine Punch. He also wrote several fictional works, including the 1887 parody Ben D'Ymion, the 1888 murder mystery Hartas Maturin, and the 1888 future war novel The Taking of Dover, before writing the pamphlet Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses. He died four years after the publication, in 1896. The representative of the Humanitarian League, which published Lester's expos√©, Reverend John Verschoyle, was also a member of the Model Abottoir Society, a council that Lester was the founder of. On the concealment of the activities within the slaughthouse, it was reported that the public had condemned the \\"pariah class\\" slaughtermen, and that the \\"lads and little boys\\" had become curious, peering through the fences and banging at the doors, at establishments in Deptford and Islington, among others. This led Lester to write the slaughterhouse expos√©, which he justified because he believed that \\"meat-eaters had a moral obligation to understand the \\"demoralization of character\\" that was a necessary step in the provision of meat,\\" according to the cultural historian and food writer Paula Young Lee in her 2008 work, Meat, Modernity and the Rise of the Slaughterhouse. For his contributions to writing on the subject of London slaughterhouses, the president of The Vegetarian Society Henry S. Salt refers to Lester as an expert in his 1921 autobiographical work, Seventy Years Among the Savages. Publication The Humanitarian League's pages in the pamphlet The 5 x 8\\" pamphlet is 19 pages in total length, and was printed by William Reeves, at 185 Fleet Street, E. C., London in 1892. Following the title page, the pamphlet includes the \\"Manifesto of the Humanitarian League,\\" which expresses that the league works for the cessation of \\"suffering, directly or indirectly, on any sentient being.\\" Included in the manifesto is an excerpt from the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth's poem \\"Hart-Leap Well.\\" Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses was issue number five of the Humanitarian League's \\"Pamphlet Series\\" publications. The cost for one issue in the year of publication was 2 pence, and it was also the cost in 1896. The final page in the pamphlet is a listing of the Humanitarian League's Publications, which was the first five issues, and the announcement of two which were in preparation. During the Humanitarian League's annual meeting, on March 16th, 1893, Lester gave an account on the progress of slaughterhouse reform, following the publication of the pamphlet. Copies of Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses in microfilm format are available at university and public libraries in the United States, England, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. =Content= Opening page in the pamphlet The pamphlet is divided into three sections; namely \\"Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses,\\" \\"Humane Inventions for Slaughtering,\\" and \\"Legislative Interference.\\" The opening to Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses gives a quotation from Irish historian and political essayist William Edward Hartpole Lecky, who writes that the repugnance for the butcher trade has \\"simply ceased,\\" adding that their work \\"has no place in their emotions or calculations.\\" Lester then observes that \\"the ordinary human [...] shrinks instinctively from shedding the blood of one of the lower animals[,] in a community removed several steps from mere barbarism.\\" This is further indicated by the fact that \\"the sight and smell of blood [...] produces a feeling of oppression and nausea on any human being who enters the building.\\" He notes that with meat-eating, one must accept a \\"demoralisation of character,\\" as a result from the animals that must be killed, \\"whatever consequent suffering to them, and [the] degradation of the unfortunate butcher class.\\" Lester suggests, that since \\"meat is not only not necessary, [and] actually injurious,\\" then that the establishments could be converted into \\"wholesome receptables for grains and fruit.\\" According to the medical authorities, diseases, such as tuberculosis, \\"appear to be impossible to prevent [and are] readily transmissible by eating the meat or drinking the milk of such animals.\\" Finally, in this section, Lester details several instances of private slaughter-houses operating in poor conditions, as well as reprinting the notes of three public slaughter-houses which were in a similar, destitute condition. The following, two shorter sections include a listing of several newly available methods for humane slaughtering. He also recounts the efforts of Parliament which had been devoted to providing the humane treatment of animals in slaughter-houses, as well as the minimization of dangers to public health incidental to such places. =Response from the Slaughtermen= In the pamphlet, Lester refers to the killing floor operators as \\"unclean creature[s],\\" asserting that the ranks of slaughtermen are composed of \\"the dregs of the population,\\" who know that the butcher trade is \\"a nasty one, only bearable from lack of other employment and from the good wages earned.\\" This prompted one of the slaughterman to reply: ReferencesCitationsSources=    External links * * Category:1892 non- fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:Books about animal rights Category:Pamphlets Category:Vegetarian-related mass media ","title":"Behind the Scenes in Slaughter-Houses"},{"id":"64086168","text":"Mario Gjata (born 6 July 2000) is an Albanian professional footballer who currently play as a centre-forward for Albanian club FK Apolonia Fier.

Southall's Sanitary Towels for Ladies In May 1915 she was involved in looking after the casualties during the first gas attack. The suffering were trying to gain relief by having their faces washed with scraps of cotton wool soaked in vinegar. It was the FANYs idea to use sanitary towels as a more substantial replacement. The actual brand was \\"Mr Southall's conveniences for ladies\\" which they cut in half before soaking the pads in Rimmell's Toilet Vinegar. She rose to be second in command of the FANY‚ÄìVAD St Omer convoy helping to evacuate the wounded under fire. In 1919 she was awarded an MBE for her war service.

It refers specifically to a journey that Cummings made from London to County Durham after the start of a national lockdown.  Background  Cummings = Dominic Cummings was appointed in a role as a senior adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 24 July 2019. = Nationwide lockdown = On 23 March 2020, Boris Johnson announced immediate wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement in the UK in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19. He set out limited reasons upon which people could leave their homes. Self-isolation had already been instructed for those with COVID-19 symptoms, with a proviso giving a tolerance for those living with children. Neil Ferguson had resigned from the government's scientific advisory group on 5 May after it emerged that a woman had been visiting his house in contravention of lockdown rules. Catherine Calderwood, the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, had also resigned, in April, after she was seen visiting her holiday house.  Durham visit  On 27 March 2020, Boris Johnson announced he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The same day, Cummings received a phone call at work from his wife, Mary Wakefield, to say that she was feeling ill and had vomited. About an hour after Johnson's announcement, Cummings was seen rushing home from 10 Downing Street. According to Cummings, his wife's condition improved and he returned to work but that night they discussed her situation. Although she did not have a cough or fever he believed that she had caught the virus and that he was likely to catch it too. At that time he was well. They were both worried that they would become too weak to look after their four-year-old son. They drove to Durham that night to stay at a house on his parents' land near to their house and that of his sister. The sister and her daughters had offered to help with the childcare. Cummings, his wife and child arrived at Durham at around midnight. This house was 264 miles (425 km) from his usual residence in London. According to Cummings, he woke up on 28 March with COVID-19-like symptoms, which got worse in that he barely left his bed over the following days. His wife's health improved. He said he experienced a \\"bad headache and a serious fever\\". On 30 March, the government confirmed that Cummings had displayed symptoms of COVID-19 and was self-isolating at home. The report did not mention the trip to Durham. ITV News states that this is when Cummings may have made his trip to Durham. On 2 April, according to Cummings, his son became ill and was taken to hospital by ambulance following medical advice. He was tested for COVID-19 and the result given later was that he was not suffering from the virus. Cummings said he was too ill to go to the hospital, but his wife went. On 3 April, Cummings later said, that he went to fetch his wife and son by car, but did not get out of the car as his son had recovered. By 12 April, Cummings was well enough, he said, to return to London. That day the family drove to Barnard Castle (30 miles away). Cummings stated this was to test whether he was well enough to drive, having some problems with his eyesight. He left the car at Barnard Castle after feeling sick. On 13 April, along with his family, Cummings travelled back to London.  Newspaper investigations  On 22 May, the Daily Mirror and The Guardian published articles about their joint investigation alleging that the police had spoken to Cummings about breaching the government's lockdown rules in relation to a trip he made to Durham. On 23 May police confirmed that allegation to be untrue, and that they had been asked for security advice by Cummings's father, which they gave in a phone call. On 24 May, The Observer and Sunday Mirror alleged that Cummings had made a second trip to Durham on 19 April during lockdown after returning to, and being photographed in, London, allegations which Cummings denied. Mary Wakefield, Cummings' wife and a journalist and commissioning editor with The Spectator, wrote an article for the publication on 25 April, in which she described her and her husband's experiences while in lockdown with COVID-19. On the same day, she was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Today to discuss her experience with the virus. However, in neither the article nor the interview did she mention that they had travelled to Durham. Alleged inconsistencies between Cummings' account and his wife's led to two complaints from the public to the Independent Press Standards Organisation over \\"potential factual inaccuracies\\" in the article.  Cummings' response  Cummings was filmed leaving his home in London on 23 May while reporters questioned him. He said he had \\"behaved reasonably and legally\\", and when asked about how his actions looked, he said \\"Who cares about good looks? It's a question of doing the right thing. It's not about what you guys think\\". On 25 May, Cummings appeared at a press conference in the rose garden of 10 Downing Street, taking questions from the media. He explained his sequence of events and argued \\"There is no regulation covering the situation I found myself in\\". He explained that there was a proviso that journeys to facilitate child care counted as necessary and that he believed that this trip to Durham was therefore allowed. He said that he had spoken to Boris Johnson about his decision to travel to Durham at some point leading up to 6 April. He said that due to the condition both he and Johnson were in, \\"neither of us remember the conversation in any detail\\". He described experiencing threats of violence which led him to move to an \\"isolated cottage\\" on his father's farm as he became concerned about his family's safety. There were reports of the family being seen in a wood near Houghall, near Durham on 19 April, and elsewhere in the area. Cummings said they were not there, that they were in London and had not returned to Durham, pointing to evidence on his phone which he said proved this.  Reactions  Politicians = The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford and the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, called for Cummings to resign if the allegations were to be confirmed, while the Labour Party said 10 Downing Street needed to provide a \\"very swift explanation\\" for his actions. On 23 May, Downing Street released a statement saying Cummings' journey was essential, and the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps used part of the televised COVID-19 update to support him. Boris Johnson, as the speaker in next day's COVID-19 update, defended Cummings and said he had acted \\"responsibly, legally and with integrity\\". Other government ministers, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, also supported him. Following Johnson's statement of support, \\"Mr Cummings faced renewed pressure to resign after ministers, MPs, scientific advisers and pro- Conservative newspapers called on Mr Johnson to sack him\\". Forty-five Conservative Party MPs called for Cummings to resign, and a further fifty- three were critical of his actions, although they did not seek his resignation. Ex-chairman of the European Research Group (ERG), Conservative MP Steve Baker, said: \\"The country can't afford this nonsense, this pantomime, Dominic should go and we should move on and deal with things that matter in people's lives.\\" Cummings' press conference in the rose garden of 10 Downing Street was met with scepticism from both the media and the public. The day after he made it, Douglas Ross, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, resigned from the government, arguing that his interpretation of the guidelines was \\"not shared by the vast majority of people\\". The backbench MP Jeremy Hunt claimed that Cummings had breached the lockdown rules on three occasions, which were a return to work after spending time with his wife when she was ill, and visiting both Durham and Barnard Castle. = Opinion polling = The crisis saw a sharp fall in support for the Conservatives and rise in support for the Labour Party, with, according to one YouGov poll, the gap between the two parties shrinking by nine percentage points. A University College London study published in The Lancet found that confidence in the government had decreased from 4.5 out of 7 to 3.5, from the start of the lockdown to after the controversy. This was referred to by researchers as the 'Dominic Cummings effect'. A study from the Office for National Statistics showed a decline in the proportion of the public who believed unity within the country would ensue after the pandemic. = Other reactions = A number of Bishops of the Church of England were critical of the way Johnson and Cummings responded to the issue, some of whom later received hate mail. The former Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England, Nazir Afzal, whose own brother had died from COVID-19, called for bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police to reopen investigations into Cummings' lockdown movements in early August. Afzal publicly called into question the impartiality of these bodies after his requests for investigations were rejected.  Durham Constabulary investigation  On 31 March, Durham Constabulary were \\"made aware of reports that an individual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city\\". On 1 April, the constabulary spoke to Cummings' father. On 25 May 2020, Durham's acting police, crime and victims' commissioner, Steve White, asked Durham Constabulary to investigate any potential breach of the law or regulations in relation to Cummings' Durham movements. The constabulary opened an investigation into Cummings' actions the next day. On 28 May, Durham Constabulary said that they did not consider an offence to have been committed by Cummings in travelling from London to Durham. They also said that a minor breach relating to lockdown rules might have occurred at Barnard Castle, but because there was no apparent breach of the social distancing rules, no action would be taken at that point, stating: \\"Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken\\". They also said there was insufficient evidence of a return to the Durham area on 19 April. Out of the four people who claimed to have seen Cummings on this return, two later approached the police watchdog to assert that Durham Constabulary had not fully investigated their claims. On 3 June, it was reported that Durham County Council was investigating complaints it had received that the cottage Cummings stayed in did not hold the relevant planning permission.  In popular culture  The details of the scandal became the subject of mockery, particularly online, where it became an internet meme. Television presenter Paddy McGuinness tweeted a video of him singing a parody version of \\"(Is This The Way To) Amarillo\\", with the lyrics of the song changed to \\"Is this the way to Barnard Castle? Where sweet Mary waits for me\\". McGuiness also made a joke about Cummings' long driving trip during an episode of Top Gear. Comedian Tom Allen quipped that he \\"felt like Dominic Cummings\\" on an episode of Sunday Brunch, which was the first episode to air since lockdown restrictions were eased where the hosts and guests were allowed to appear in a socially distanced manner in the studio, as opposed to doing an interview via video link. Doctor Xand van Tulleken also sparked controversy during an interview on The One Show, where he made reference to the Cummings scandal while advising people on what safety precautions people needed to take to stop the spread of coronavirus, commenting: \\"Everyone as individuals does have a role to play. Social distancing, hand washing, masks in crowded places, if you have eyesight problems you should test them with a lengthy drive with your family\\". It has been suggested that Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle will be the subject of several sketches in the second series of the BritBox revival of Spitting Image. In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, Specsavers noted a 6000% increase in the online mentions of their strapline 'Should have gone to Specsavers', largely as a result of people using it in reference to Cummings' assertion that he drove to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight. In response, the optician offered free eye tests to anyone visiting Barnard Castle, with vouchers appearing on the back of parking meter tickets in the local area with the details of their Barnard Castle store. BrewDog produced a new IPA in May 2020 called 'Barnard Castle Eye Test IPA' to \\"commemorate\\" the Cummings scandal. The name was voted for by BrewDog's social media followers, with other suggested names including 'Cummings & Goings', '260 Miles' and 'Stay at Homes'. = Dramatisation = It was reported that the controller of BBC drama commissioning, Piers Wenger, was considering purchasing rights to a drama adaptation of the scandal, and that writers were delivering pitches to the corporation.

He played forty-nine first-class matches for South Australia between 1918/19 and 1931/32, captaining the state in two of them.List of South Australia captains at SACA website, retrieved 28 May 2020 He played for Port Adelaide Cricket Club in district cricket from 1910 to 1935/36 and captained them from 1922 to 1927. His batting was noted for being unorthodox, as it was cross-bat, and aggressive. He was also notable for his quality as a slips fielder, only fielding in that position. Cricket career Pritchard began playing cricket while attending Largs Bay College and scored the first century made by a member of his College team. When he was seventeen he joined the Port Adelaide B team and in 1911 he debuted for the senior side in district cricket. A 1912 match report noted that Pritchard showed potential. When the district competition was suspended during WWI he played for the Foresters in the Adelaide and Suburban Cricket Association competition. When district cricket resumed Pritchard topped the batting averages for Port Adelaide for the 1918‚Äì19 season scoring 548 runs at an average of 68.5. On 1 January 1919, Pritchard made his First-Class debut for South Australia in a match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having been named twelfth man but substituted in for Hurtle Willsmore for the game and he scored a 3 in both of South Australia's innings.Victoria v South Australia, 1-4 Jan 1919 scorecard at Cricinfo In the 1919-20 district season he scored 846 runs at an average of 94 which was the record season aggregate for South Australian cricket at the time, however in the 1919-20 Sheffield Shield season he averaged just 20.83 in his three matches,Sheffield Shield 1919/20: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo with the only highlight of his season being a partnership with Vic Richardson against Victoria in which he scored 91.Victoria v South Australia, 2-6 Jan 1920 scorecard at Cricinfo In the 1920-21 Sheffield Shield season he played in just two of South Australia's four games and scored 44 runs at an average of 11.Sheffield Shield 1920/21: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo A later report attributed his struggles early in his First-Class career to nerves causing him to lose his wicket early in his innings. In December 1921 Pritchard scored his first century in First-Class cricket in the first Sheffield Shield game of the season against New South Wales, but despite a good start in South Australia's second innings he was stumped for 22 during a batting collapse and South Australia lost the game. He did not pass fifty again in the 1921‚Äì22 season and averaged 35 overall.Sheffield Shield 1921/22: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo In 1922 he became captain of Port Adelaide when captain J. R. Moroney briefly left the country, and in 1923 when Moroney returned Pritchard was elected captain in his stead with Moroney consenting to serve as vice-captain. He reportedly lost the toss a remarkable number of times in his early years of captaincy. He only represented South Australia once in the 1922-23 Sheffield Shield season, scoring just 16 runs in his only match.Sheffield Shield 1922/23: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo The following season was his best yet for South Australia in which he played three matches and scored 249 runs at an average of 49.80,Sheffield Shield 1923/24: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo although he struggled in district cricket after the interstate games with his club season being described as a rank failure. Dave Pritchard, 1924. In October 1924 a report named him the best left-handed batsman in South Australia, and noted that while he had previously been limited to leg-side scoring he had improved his off-side play considerably. He was prevented from showcasing his improvement in South Australia's first game of the Shield season as he was confined to bed due to influenza, however in the remaining three games he was able to score 488 runs, the second highest for the season, at an average of 81.33 with two centuries and four fifties.Sheffield Shield 1924/25: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo He also represented South Australia in both of their tour games against the M.C.C. as part of the 1924-25 Ashes scoring 87 in the second matchSouth Australia v Marleybone Cricket Club 13-16 March 1925 at Cricinfo and hitting Maurice Tate for fifteen off one over. As of late 1924 he was being described as the best club batsman in South Australia, and among the best left-handed batsmen in the country second only to Warren Bardsley. In January 1925 a writer suggested that Pritchard would have been selected for Australia had he played for New South Wales or Victoria, praising him for his more aggressive approach to batting, and he was reportedly in consideration for selection for the Test team that month, but had a poor start to the district cricket season with a series of small scores. In February 1925 some Adelaide newspapers called for Pritchard to begin opening the batting for Port Adelaide and South Australia so that he could be selected as opener for Australia when Warren Bardsley retired. A report on his performance in a club game described him as too nervous to effectively open the batting. In March an Adelaide paper called for him to be selected for the Australian Test tour to England, suggesting that if he emulated his success of the 1924‚Äì25 season he would have to be selected. In November 1925 a trial match between two Australian teams was held and Pritchard's omission from either side was noted. He performed well in a non-Sheffield Shield interstate game against Western Australia in November 1925 scoring 167, of which the first 111 were scored in just 125 minutes with 13 fours and a six, which intensified criticism of his omission from the intra-Australia match, particularly towards selector Clem Hill. The criticism abated when Johnny Taylor withdrew from the trial match to undertake university examinations and Pritchard was selected in his place, although it was suggested that he would be an emergency substitute not in either playing XI. He did not play in the match, which drew further criticism from South Australia, where it had been hoped that he would have been able to secure selection in the Test team for the Ashes Tour. The decision was also criticized as while it was intended as a compliment it meant Pritchard had traveled from South Australia to Sydney only to carry drinks. Overall in the 1925-26 Sheffield Shield season itself Pritchard failed to emulate his success the previous season, scoring just 151 runs at an average of 18.87 batting at three for the first three matches and dropping down the order to six for the last game.Sheffield Shield 1925/26: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo He was able to improve on his performance in district cricket after the end of the Shield season, with it being reported he had gotten his \\"punch back\\" after his disappointing First-Class season, and by April he was averaging 59.37 for Port Adelaide. He also bowled in a game against East Torrens taking 2 for 65 on a bat-friendly pitch in February 1926. Pritchard missed three weeks of the district cricket season due to influenza in October 1926, losing weight due to his illness. He struggled again in the 1926-27 Sheffield Shield season passing 50 only once and scoring 243 runs at 27.00 in five games.Sheffield Shield 1926/27: Batting - Most Runs at Cricinfo His poor form continued in district cricket until he scored 130 for Port Adelaide in February 1927. In October 1927 he lost the captaincy of Port Adelaide, with Norman Williams succeeding him. He was unable to play Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1927‚Äì28 season, despite being selected in the first game of the season, and his absence was noted, with a writer expressing that they hoped it was only due to business commitments and he would be able to return to interstate cricket soon. He scored 537 runs at 69 for Port Adelaide in the 1927-28 district cricket season. David Pritchard batting for Port Adelaide, 1932. In October 1928 he was selected to represent South Australia in a match against the touring English Ashes side, and he was noted for his good fielding in the slips, and scored 119South Australia v Marleybone Cricket Club, 27-30 October 1928 at Cricinfo in a hard-hitting innings in which his pull-shot was prominent. His partnership of 255 with Vic Richardson against the M.C.C. was the record for South Australia against England, and South Australian media began to suggest his name for the Australian side again. However he only played in one game in the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 12 and 15 against Victoria in Melbourne in what was described as a disastrous trip for South Australia.Victoria v South Australia 9-13, November 1928 at Cricinfo His absence from the state side was lamented, suggesting that it was due to personal circumstances and not lack of ability to be selected, and he scored 327 not out in a district semi-final for Port Adelaide, which was the first 300 and record for the highest score in South Australian grade cricket which remained unbroken until 1936. This innings resulted in it being suggested that he may have been selected for Australia had he played interstate cricket in the season. He passed 1000 runs for the 1928-29 district cricket season in the grand final, and reached an aggregate of 1023 runs at an average of 102.30 for the district season breaking the South Australia season aggregate record for the second time in his career. It was suggested South Australia may have won the Sheffield Shield had Pritchard been able to play for them. In November 1929 Pritchard represented South Australia against the M.C.C. in a tour game again scoring 27 and a duck.South Australia v Marleybone Cricket Club, 8-12 November 1929 He was also able to play in all of South Australia's games in the 1929-30 Sheffield Shield season and scored 530 runs at an average of 44.16 with a century and two fifties.SHEFFIELD SHIELD, 1929/30 - SOUTH AUSTRALIA / RECORDS / BATTING AND BOWLING AVERAGES at Cricinfo He was described as the best slips fielder in Australia in February 1930. In October 1930 Pritchard was selected as Captain of South Australia for a game against Queensland in Brisbane in the absence of Vic Richardson who was still returning from England after the Ashes. Ahead of the game he said \\"Although a number of our best players are absent, we expect to give Queensland a good fight.\\", however Queensland won by seven wickets.Queensland v South Australia, 31 Oct - 3 Nov 1930 He captained South Australia a second time in November against New South Wales in Sydney, in a game which New South Wales won by 213 runs.New South Wales v South Australia 7-11 Nov 1930 Pritchard dropped Don Bradman at first slip when he was on 40 in the game, and Bradman went on to score a century. Pritchard played just one other Shield game in the 1930‚Äì31 season scoring 120 runs at 20.00 with one fifty overall in the 1930‚Äì31 season.Sheffield Shield 1930/31: Batting Averages on Cricinfo In the 1931-32 Sheffield Shield season, his last for South Australia, he played just one game in November 1931 against Victoria in Adelaide scoring 6 and a duck.South Australia v Victoria, 13-17 Nov 1931 at Cricinfo He had a run of poor scores in district cricket after his last First-Class game, but had a return to form in February, 1932, scoring his first fifty of the season in forty-nine minutes, in an innings of ninety-nine for Port Adelaide against Colts. A match report from the 1932-33 district season notes that he had given fine service to South Australia, suggesting he had formally retired from First-Class cricket. He continued to play district cricket and in January 1933 he scored 110 with eleven fours against West Torrens. In February 1934 he had a good run of scores for Port Adelaide with straight drives and strong pulls to leg being noted as his best shots. He scored 189 runs at an average of 27.00 without passing fifty in the 1934-35 district season, and retired after the 1935‚Äì36 season. In his district career he had scored an estimated 7108 runs and taken 46 wickets at an average of 28.30 for Port Adelaide. In 1942 Pritchard came out of retirement to play for a Port Adelaide Veterans side in a single innings charity match for the Fighting Forces Comfort Fund, but made a duck. Post-retirement After cricket Pritchard played tennis at a high level into his fifties, and he was playing lawn bowls as of 1953. In his career Pritchard was a stock-broker. In 1944 he was almost killed when he was electrocuted while inspecting the premises of R. J. Finlayson & Co. Ltd. In 1953 he was a member of a mine inspecting party to Tennant Creek.

He served in the War of American Independence, earning a membership in the Society of Cincinnati and the Order of Saint Louis.  Biography  Flotte was born to an old noble family from Gap. In 1750, Flotte served as Page to the King, and as Lieutenant in the R√©giment de Belzunce in 1753, before joining the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 4 July 1754. He was part of the √©lite Garde du Pavillon. In 1755, he served on Entreprenant for a mission to Canada in the squadron under Dubois de la Motte, and later the same year, on Galat√©e. He was promoted to Ensign in April 1756, and served in the Eastern Mediterranean. In July, he was appointed to the 64-gun Vaillant, under Choiseul, to support La Galissoni√®re. He then served on the 66-gun Hercule from 9 November to 10 December 1757, and on Oriflamme from 30 January to 17 February 1758, although Oriflamme never managed to get a sufficient complement and cancelled her mission. He then served on the frigate Chim√®re, tasked with returning Turkish prisoners to Constantinople. In 1759, he was on the 64-gun Modeste, and he took part in the Battle of Lagos on 18 and 19 August. Modeste attempted to seek shelter in neutral Portuguese waters, but British admiral Boscawen violated that neutrality and captured Modeste and Souverain. Flotte was taken prisoner but immediately released, and he returned to Toulon commanding the brig Saint Paul. From 1759 to 1763, Flotte served on light units in the Mediterranean, escorting merchantmen and chasing Barbary corsairs. In 1763, he served on Pl√©√Øade for a raid against the Sal√© Rovers. Pl√©√Øade patrolled between Oran and Algiers, along with the xebecs Singe and Cam√©l√©on. On 15 July 1763, Singe mistakenly engaged a galiot from Algiers, which she mistook for a Sal√© rover. Pl√©√Øade intervened fired two broadsides into the galiot, which sank with all hands before the error was realised. This triggered a diplomatic incident and Captain Fabry had to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. Flotte was promoted to Lieutenant on 27 November 1765. he served on Singe under Suffren, and on Atalante, under Forbin d'Opp√®de, taking part in the Tunis expedition of 1770. In 1771, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint-Louis. He cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the frigate Mignonne between 1773 and 1774, again under Suffren. On 29 September 1775, Flotte married his cousin Th√©r√®se de Vitalis. Around that time, started reading the works of Rousseau and adhere to the ideological framework of the Lumi√®res. In 1777, Flotte was given command of a company of naval riflemen on the 64-gun Fantasque, under Suffren, but that unit was replaced by a regular infantry and Flotte did not embark. He was then given his first command, the sloop √âclair. On 3 October 1777, √âclair captured a merchantman laden with British goods, and on 22, a British privateer. In January 1778, while returning from escort duty, √âclair met three British ships, including one privateer. Seeing √âclair preparing to attack, the privateer retreated, leaving two merchantmen unprotected. √âclair promptly captured them. Flotte gave chase to the privateer, but she was a better sailship and managed to escape. In March 1779, Flotte arrived a Toulon with his prizes, and wrote a report to Navy Minister Sartine, complete with suggestions to improve the speed of √âclair that his unsuccessful chase had inspired. On 13 March 1779, Flotte was promoted to Captain, and given commander of the frigate Aurore. He took part in the blockade of Mah√≥n, and captured a neutral Swedish merchantman, we he brought to Toulon. The prize was found unlawful and released. Flotte then cruised off Algiers, where he captured four British privateers, which he brought to Toulon on 20 August. Flotte returned to Algiers, escorting a merchantman. While he was ashore paying a diplomatic visit to the Dey, a four-ship British convoy appeared. Flotte hastily returned to Aurore and gave chase. She soon caught up with her quarries and brought them to Algiers. The British claimed that the capture had occurred in neutral waters and was therefore illegal. Algerian tribunals ruled in favour of the French. In October, Aurore departed Marseille, escorting a 26-ship convoy bound for Martinique, ferrying supplies for the French colonies of the Caribbeans and for the division under Chef d'Escadre Lamotte-Picquet, as well as diplomat G√©rard de Rayneval. On 30 November, off Mah√≥n, he had to repel an attack by five British privateers. Arriving in Saint Lucia channel, the body of water between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique, the convoy met a 13-ship British squadron under Admiral Hyde Parker. The British gave chase, and Flotte opened fire, still out of range, as to warn the French forces at Martinique. Lamotte scrambled to cover the escape of the convoy, leading to the Battle of Martinique. After the battle, Governor Bouill√© blamed Flotte for choosing Saint Lucie channel over Saint Dominique channel, and consequently Flotte was not among those distinguished for the action. Flotte's mission as captain of Aurore ended on 12 May 1780. In 1781, Flotte was given command of the frigate Lutine, escorting convoys in the Eastern Mediterranean and calling Marseille, Malta, Smyrna and Foilleri. Lutine departed on 7 October, along with Pl√©√Øade and Montr√©al. She arrived at the Golden Horn on 10 November, where Pl√©√Øade detached to sail to Thessaloniki with a part of the convoy, and Montr√©al to Constantinople, while Lutine continued to Smyrna. After waiting for a return convoy to assemble, he departed for Toulon on 21 March, leading 69 merchantmen. Bad weather forced the convoy to seek shelter in Kolori harbour, near Athens. At Athens, Flotte procured supplies for the crew of his convoy. Turkish officials then offered a number of sheep, and in the ensuing exchange of counter-gift, Flotte offered is watch and pistols, and was gifted an antique Classical Greek relief. He departed Athens on 7 May, called Malta on 27, and arrived at Marseille in the evening of 20 June 1782. After returning to Toulon, Flotte reported the acquisition of the relief to Navy Minister Castries, who suggested presenting it to Louis XVI. In August 1782, Flotte was given command of the 74-gun Destin, succeeding Goimpy, and sailed to Cadiz to reinforce the fleet under C√≥rdova. He led a division comprising the 64-gun Provence and √âveill√©, and the frigate Pr√©cieuse. Flotte was promoted to Brigadier on 1 January 1785. He was given command of the 20-gun corvette Favorite in the Escadre d'√©volution, and was present at Cherbourg naval base when Louis XVI visited it in April 1786. Flotte was promoted to Chef de Division in May 1786. He became the commander of the French division off Western Africa until 1787, with his flag on the 40-gun Junon. The division also comprised the frigate C√©r√®s and the cutter Malin, under Lieutenant d'Orvilliers. He departed Rochefort on 14 November 1786. Soon afterwards, a nine-day storm scattered the division. C√©r√®s and Junon regrouped on 21, but Malin did not reappear. She had been wrecked in Bay of Biscay. From January 1787, Flotte made efforts to develop slaving outposts and factories on the coast, but failed. He returned to Toulon after 85 days, on 8 September 1787. By 1 October 1789, Flotte was at Toulon, under Albert de Rions, as general officer commanding the Navy in Toulon. Flotte lead the second Division of the Seventh Squadron. The life of the workers of the arsenal was dire: their pay very low, they were liable to find employment only one out of two or three days, and due to the financial crisis they were also often paid only with delay. The bad harvest of 1789 and harsh winter that year compounded the issue by raising prices, and the ensuing misery yielded unrest. Albert de Rions reacted with rigidity and scorn, alienating the workers, and in December, a riot let to his transfer to Brest. Flotte, who had a reputation as a Liberal, replaced him as commander of the naval forces stationned at Toulon. Flotte was promoted to Contre-amiral on 1 July 1792. On 10 September 1792, rioting workers of the port seized Flotte and hanged him, next to the door of Toulon arsenal.

In the form of a long tunic, in general with long sleeves, worn with a belt (mdama) which can be extended under a lot of styles and colors. The Moroccan kaftan results from the expertise of craftsmen and dressmakers (maalem) of the country, under the influence of Berber (Amazigh) and Andalusian cultures, it has become also a part of the booming Moroccan textile sector, which accounts for 30% of the country's industrial employment and 15% of its exports.. It is considered to be the ultimate formal attire for Moroccan women during ceremonies (weddings, baptisms, religious festivals). Moroccan stylists have modernized the traditional kaftan by adapting it to the particularities of the current era. The Moroccan kaftan has gained popularity after being introduced by major clothing lines, and stylists, through prestigious fashion shows, such as the Oriental Fashion Show during \\"Fashions week \\" around the world; as well as the promotion work of Moroccan magazines like \\"Femmes du Maroc\\"(Moroccan Ladies). Nowadays, the Moroccan kaftan popularity has exceeded the country's borders. It is exported in large quantities abroad.  History  In the Presence of the Sultan of Morocco (13th century), In this miniature, the Moroccan Emperor and Almohad caliph Abu Hafs Omar Al-Murtada appears in a caftan embroidered with the sififa (half collar), taking advice in his court in Marrakesh from his entourage the day after he received the ambassadors of Castile, Contemporary photography from the 13th-century manuscript \\"Las Cantigas de Santa Maria\\", preserved in the Escorial Museum, Madrid, Spain. Ch√©rifa Lalla-Messaouda a political figure and mother of the Saadi dynasty sultan Ahmad al-Mansur. 16th century In Morocco, the kaftan is a very old tradition and deeply rooted in the country's clothing habits. Indeed, this dress appeared in the 13th century at the time of the Marinid dynasty, when it was worn by Moroccan royalty. Its name and distant roots are said to be found in the Persian heritage introduced to Morocco and al-Andalus by Muslim conquerors. But the evolution and the feminization of this habit in Morocco made it a very different garment from the Persian and Ottoman caftans. From the beginning of the 13th century, there were 3,096 weaver in the city of Fez, Ibn Khaldun referred to the Marinid sultans \`dar-al-tiraz~, which he called a Marinid innovation. Sultans of the Marinid dynasty of Morocco used to send brocade caftans as gifts to each new sultan of the Ottoman Empire, which were the first kaftans owned by the Ottoman sultans. During Saadi dynasty (1554-1636AD), new type of kaftan was introduced by sultan Ahmad al-Mansur that took the name of Al Mansouria as reference to his name, also in his era the kaftan was adopted by the general public.  Types and styles  The kaftan has become a masterpiece for Moroccan city dwellers. Carved from beautiful materials imported from Europe, and worn by dignitaries (men) and the notables of the great Moroccan cities (Fez, Meknes ...). Originally, only the sultans and their wives had the privilege of obtaining such an expensive garment, since the seamstresses spent months shaping it, embroidering it, beading it by hand, in noble weavings and with gold and silver thread. The kaftan, commonly worn by Moroccan men and women, is an everyday garment. However, the holiday one was enriched with trimmings of gold and silver threads. All city dwellers had to wear their kaftan in the afternoon. They met in their homes or on the terraces of houses to exchange their impressions on things or just to get occupied with their hobbies such as embroidery. The caftan texture can be extracted from sheet, velvet, brocaded silk, sateen or cotton, textiles which are made locally or imported from Europe or the Orient for the rarest. In the XVIIth century, during the reign of Moulay Isma√Øl, the merchants of the big cities brought in large quantities of fine silk and wool sheets, of all colors and all kinds, such as brocade, velvet, striped or plain taffeta and scarlet. Morocco has preserved its ancestral craftsmanship and expertise such as weaving, embroidery and trimmings like the Ben Cherif family who maintained the back-strap weaving technique, the making of gold and silver thread and embroidery, which is currently experiencing a clear development. The Moroccan Jewish kaftan, is that of Fez made of gold thread embroidery called \\"n‚Äôta√¢\\". The Moroccan stylists were able to adapt their skills to the changing times. Today the kaftan is designed to be more tight and cut closer to the body, to better fit the silhouette, as a result, it has become a modern and elegant garment, easy to wear, but adorned with a prestige that derives its origins from the legendary past. It remains the privileged item of clothing for Moroccan women, whether young or old. The Moroccan caftan is now a skillful combination of elegance, refinement and comfort, yet the past is not denied. Moroccan kaftans can be worn on special or official occasions, depending on the used materials. = Moroccan caftan in the Ottaman Empire = The history of textile production in Turkey dates back to the Ottoman period. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, textile production was widespread and very advanced. Until the fall of the empire, the Ottoman industry was heavily dependent on textile production, it was a clear indication for the importance of the sector. Though the Ottoman Empire did not extend to Morocco, the sultans of the Marinid dynasty sent luxurious gifts to the Ottoman sultans. The name of Morocco was associated with the name of Fez (in Turkish: Fas); the Ottomans welcomed the silk caftan and named it ,up to the present , Fas Kaftanlar (or Fas Kaftanƒ±, or Fas Kaftanlarƒ±).

Its verses are divided according to the rhythm of the language. The Qur'anic punctuation is, therefore, not only based on the structure or the syntax of the sentence, but also on the need to pause, for breath or for effect. Pickthall observes, when a certain sound which marks the rhythm recurs, there is a strong pause and the verse ends naturally, although the sentence may go on to the next verse. Thus the Qur'anic punctuation affects the pronunciation of the words, rhythm, intonation and syllable separation.  History  There are various conventions related to punctuation varying from time and place to another. Although there were manuscripts written on the topic, the convention that took off is attributed to Muhammad ibn Tayfour Sajawandi (d. 560 AH). There are various hadiths related to the topic, one of them being:  Punctuation marks  The Full Stop = €ù - After a full stop, the last letter of the verse loses its vowel, if consonant, or converts the tanwin into an elongated alif, if an alif's tanwin. = The Signs of pause () = These are generally placed at the top of the line they apply to in a sentence.  Mandatory Pauses  \\\\- A mim () at the top, it's an abbreviation of (necessary). It means disregarding the sign may lead to change in the meaning. \\\\- Abbreviation of (absolute). Full stop even though the verse is not complete. \\\\- Lam and alif glyph which means 'no' in Arabic when uttered in isolation. Forbidden stop, which means you should not stop here, else it may change the meaning. It prevents the most related words from getting split. If stopped, the reciter should start from a place before the sign, unless it's the end of a verse. or - Abbreviation of (silence). Pause without breathing out, giving a silence effect. \\\\- or (rest). Same with the previous one, but with a somewhat longer pause.  Discretionary Pauses  Because the reciter may feel the need to stop, for example, because of need for a breath or other bodily necessities, there are these signs placed. These signs are the canonical signs popularized by Sahrawandi, though there have been many other proposed sets of signs. \\\\- Abbreviation of (permitted). It is better to stop, but in one's own discretion, may proceed also. \\\\- abbr of (permitted). It is better not to stop. \\\\- abbr of (admissible). It is better not to stop but if the reciter is tired or any other valid reason, one may stop. \\\\- abbr of . It is better not to stop. \\\\- abbr of . It is better to stop, facilitating the understanding of the verse's meaning. \\\\- abbr of . The majority view is that one should pause here. \\\\- abbr of (junction is more appropriate). It is better not to stop. The reciter can stop or continue depending on his convenience. \\\\- Named (hugging) signs, these three dots are usually paired and placed near each other with one or two words between them. The reciter should stop at one of them, though which one is in their own discretion. In Indopak mushafs, these three dots are placed above a small sign. = Marginal marks = These show the divisions of the mushaf into chapters, parts and sections. It's arranged into 114 chapters (surah). Each chapter consists of a number of verses (ayah). Verses are numbered at the end inside the full stop sign. A chapter may additionally be divided into sections (ruku' ). The end of a section is shown by an 'ayn sign. The mushafs are also divided into thirty equal parts (juz'), for those who wish to finish the recitation in a given time. These are indicated at the start of each one which occurs in 20 pages in most modern texts. The ajza' (pl. of juz') are further divided, which makes them 60th parts of a mushaf, hizb. There are 3 different hizb signs at the margin indicating the place in the juz': for the first quarter, for the half, and (abbr. of ) for the last quarter. The word (prostration) written on the margin or on an ayah sign means that a Muslim reciting that verse and the ones listening should offer a prostration. This sign is found in 14 places in a mushaf. All the sajda verses are Meccan. There are some marginal signs used in the Indian subcontinent: ‡£¢ Used in the subcontinent, this indicates a difference of opinion on the pause. (pause of the Prophet) for pause, and (pause of Gabriel) also for pause, (pause of mercy) for pause, (pause of unbelief) for 'Do not pause'.

It was part of a group of stations informally referred to as \\"Apex\\" stations, because it transmitted programming intended for the general public over what was then known as \\"ultra-high short-wave\\" frequencies. Although co-owned with AM station WSM, it primarily originated its own programs. W4XA ceased broadcasting in 1940, as station management prepared to inaugurate a new FM station, W47NV. History W4XA made its formal debut broadcast on April 10, 1939.\\"Formal Opening\\" (advertisement), Nashville Tennessean, April 9, 1939, page A-5. The \\"4\\" in W4XA's call sign indicated that it was located in the 4th radio district, while the \\"X\\" reflected its operation as an experimental station. In the early 1930s, technical advances made it possible to transmit using much higher frequencies than before. It soon became apparent that there were significant differences in the propagation characteristics of various frequency ranges. Signals from shortwave stations, operating roughly in the range from 5 MHz to 20 MHz, were found to be readily reflected by the ionosphere during both the day and at night, resulting in stations that sometimes could transmit halfway around the world. In addition, initial investigations suggested that distant signal propagation by both groundwave and skywave generally became minimal above around 20 MHz, which meant that station coverage was limited to just line-of-sight distances from the transmitting antenna. This was considered to be a valuable characteristic by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), because it would allow the establishment of broadcasting stations with limited but consistent day and night coverage, that could only be received by their local communities. It also meant that multiple stations could operate on the same frequency throughout the country without interfering with each other.\\"The VHF/UHF Line of Sight Horizon\\" (em.hawaii.edu) Due to the line-of-sight limitation, there was a premium on placing antennas at high elevations, which led to these stations as a group becoming informally known as \\"Apex\\" stations. A number of organizations independently applied for experimental licenses in order to investigate the potential of was then known as \\"ultra-high short-wave\\" transmissions. The FCC began issuing licenses to parties interested in testing the suitability of higher frequencies, commonly for transmissions using had wider bandwidths compared to standard AM band stations, and thus capable of higher fidelity transmissions. By the late 1930s The National Life and Accident Insurance Company already had extensive broadcasting experience, beginning with an AM station, WSM, which it founded in 1925, and the station's staff was interested in developing an additional broadcast service on the new frequencies. National Life was issued a construction permit, with the call sign W4XA, for an experimental broadcasting station in late 1938,\\"High Frequency (Apex) Broadcast Stations in the United States\\" (Authorized by FCC as of January 1, 1939), Broadcasting Yearbook (1939), page 367. with construction under the oversight of WSM's chief engineer John DeWitt, Jr.\\"We Pay Our Respects To ‚Äî John Hibbert DeWitt Jr.\\", Broadcasting, September 1, 1941, page 33. W4XA made its formal debut on the evening of April 10, 1939, transmitting on 26,150 kHz. In order to place the transmitting antenna as high as possible, W4XA's was installed atop WSM's existing tower, which at the time was one of the tallest in the United States.\\"The Coincidence of U. H. F. Fading\\" by Perry Ferrell, Jr., Radio, April 1941, page 9. Although most Apex stations primarily simulcast the programs of an affiliated AM station, W4XA's programming was normally independent from WSM's. At its start the station advertised that it was \\"Offering to the Music Lovers of Nashville and Immediate Vicinity: Solid Hours of the World's Greatest Music, Finest Quality Reception, A New Experience For Radio Listeners\\". In contrast to the showcase Grand Ole Opry program on WSM, W4XA's programming was \\"purely classical except for two news periods daily\\".\\"New Ultra-High Service Inaugurated by WSM\\", Broadcasting, May 15, 1939, page 63. Initially W4XA's schedule was 35 hours per week, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and 6:30 to 10:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday, plus children's programs from 4:00 to 4:30 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\\"WSM Opens Short-Wave Station\\", Rural Radio, May 1939, page 10. A major limitation on the potential audience was that most radio receivers of this era could not be tuned to the high frequency used by W4XA, although a convertor could be installed in existing receivers, and in July 1939 Gambill's Moto-Home advertised \\"a small radio convertor to pick up WX4A\\" for $12.95.\\"Who's Who...And What's What in Nashville\\" (advertisement #112), Nashville Tennessean, July 9, 1939, page A-7. Because it was operating under an experimental license, W4XA was prohibited from selling advertising time, although it was allowed to simulcast commercial programs broadcast by WSM. W4XA was described at its introduction as being an \\"experiment with the efficiency of shortwaves for local broadcasting\\". However, it was soon realized that, contrary to initial expectations, at times stations operating on frequencies in the 25 MHz range actually did produce strong skywave signals, due to a strengthening of the ionosphere during periods of high solar activity, which most commonly occurred in the summer months during mid-day hours, and also during peaks in the 11-year sunspot cycle. Thus, at times W4XA was unintentionally being heard as far away as in Australia.The Australasian Radio World, \\"Shortwave Review\\" by Alan H. Graham, June 10, 1949, page 41. This determination led to the FCC moving the developing broadcasting service stations, which by now began to include experimental FM radio and TV stations, to higher frequencies that were less affected by solar influences. Although W4XA, provided superior sound quality as a high-fidelity AM station, it was eventually determined that a then-new technology, \\"frequency modulation\\" (FM) transmission, was even better, especially in eliminating static interference. In March 1940 it was reported that WSM staff were interested in establishing an FM station.\\"Frequency Modulation Broadcasting Is Sought\\", Nashville Banner, March 27, 1940, page 7. W4XA ended operations sometime in 1940, in order to make way for a commercial FM station, W47NV, which debuted in March 1941.\\"FCC Authorization For 53 Commercial FM Outlets Given\\", Broadcasting, August 18, 1941, page 54.

He participated in the Peruvian resistance during the Pacific War. He became President of the Congress of the Republic (1913) and first Vice President of the Republic (1915-1919). Biography Bent√≠n was born in Lima to Antonio Bent√≠n y La Fuente (1826-1897) and Manuela S√°nchez Laos. His father was a mining businessman of British descent. Antonio served as Prime Minister and Mayor of Lima and was a founding member of the Democratic Party. He studied at Noboa College and then at the Colegio Nuestra Senora Guadalupe. In 1870, he entered the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos to study Law, although he later left the university to support his father in his mining business. He married Rosa Mujica Carassa, daughter of the mining businessman El√≠as Mujica y Trasmonte. The couple had eight children, including Jos√© and Ricardo Bent√≠n Mujica: the latter served as president of the brewery \\"Backus & Johnston\\" and founder of the \\"Club Sporting Cristal\\". In 1879 he was appointed sub-prefect of Huarochir√≠ Province. When Chile declared war on Peru that same year, he enlisted in the Reserve Army. While serving in the army, he participated in the defense of Lima. Along with his fellow soldiers he played a significant role in occupying the Olleros and Sisicaya ravines, while avoiding the invasion of the enemy. In addition to assuming the leadership of the montoneras guerrillas and rescuing the abandoned camps from battlefields like San Juan and Miraflores, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant major (1882). After the occupation of Lima, he joined the resistance led by General Andr√©s A. C√°ceres. He actively fought throughout the \\"Campa√±a de la Bre√±a\\", one of the last phases of the Pacific War. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel of cavalry in 1884. After the war with Chile, he retired from military service and returned to civilian life, dedicating himself to mining as well as political activity. In 1886, he was elected deputy for Lima and Huarochir√≠. While serving as a deputy, he voiced opposition to the signing of the Grace Contract between the first government of President C√°ceres and the English Committee of Bondholders. In opposition to the actions of the government, he resigned from Congress in 1889. In retirement, he dedicated himself to mining activities, signing an agreement with Backus & Johnston Co.. The company settled its properties in Aguas Calientes (Casapalca), which was a silver-rich region. In 1889, Backus & Johnston established a refinery in Casapalca, where they extracted silver, lead, and copper. However, in 1919, the \\"Cerro de Pasco\\" Copper Corporation acquired the Backus & Johnston Mining company. Bent√≠n sold the corporation the mines Backus and Johnson possessed in Aguas Calientes. In return, he received shares in the Backus & Johnston Ltd. Brewery, which was then owned by the corporation. In 1895, he returned to Congress, again as a deputy of the constituency of Huarochir√≠. Bentin supported the revolution of Nicolas de Pierola against the second government of C√°ceres. He was re-elected as a deputy in 1918. Bentin was elected the president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1913, during the checkered government of Guillermo Billinghurst. Billinghurst threatened to dissolve the parliament, due to the frequent confrontations he and the legislature had. But he himself ended up overthrown in 1914. Bentin was elected First Vice President of the Republic in the second government of Jos√© Pardo (1915-1919). After the coup d'√©tat of Augusto Legu√≠a in 1919, he withdrew from political activities. He died in Lima on 22 September 1921, and was buried in the Mat√≠as Maestro Presbyterian Cemetery in Lima. In 1951, in the R√≠mac District of Lima, a school named Instituci√≥n Edicativa Emblemetica Ricardo Bent√≠n was built in his honor, which still bears his name .

Life Hannikainen was born to parents Mikael Abrahamsson Hannikainen (b.1771), a farmowner and county judge from S√§√§minki Kiilanm√§ki, and to Katarina L√∂pp√∂nen (b.1785), his father‚Äôs second wife. The composer Pekka Juhani Hannikainen was Pietari Hannikainen‚Äôs nephew. He graduated in 1833 and continued studying at the University of Helsinki. During a time of Fennomania in Finland he was one of the first students to complete an examination of Finnish language. He became highly involved in the promotion of the Finnish language and in 1851 he also took back his original name of Hannikainen, which had been changed to Han√©n when he started school. It was also in 1851 that he bought a farm in Parikkala where he lived until his death in 1899. He is buried in Parikkala. Pietari Hannikainen was married to Katarina Margareta Krank (b. 1862) from 1854 to 1862. After the death of his first wife he married Emilia Savander (b. 1910) in 1864. His children from these two marriages were sons August Edvard Hannikainen (1854-1939) Hiittinen district Hitis representative, Peter Woldemar Hannikainen (1858-1928) general director of the Finnish Forest Administration Mets√§hallitus and State Councillor (Russia), Karl Onni Gerhard Hannikainen (1865-1930) author and rector of Kuopio Lyceum, Tauno Robert Alarik Hannikainen (1868-1953) Antrea district Kamenogorsk doctor and councillor of medicine, and daughters Armias Forsblom (1860-1946) she and her husband were tenant housekeepers of the Koitsanlahti Manor, Fanny Vilhelmiina Ilmoni (1854-1934) mother of Finnish painter Einar Ilmoni who was a student of Helene Schjerfbeck. Career Hannikainen became a deputy surveyor in 1835 and received the title of surveyor in 1843. He worked as a deputy surveyor in Viipuri Province from 1849 as a permanent commission surveyor in 1857‚Äì1866, as a permanent commissioner 1866‚Äì1874 and as a senior commissioner 1874‚Äì1879. Parallel to his work as a surveyor Hannikainen became deeply involved in linguistic and literary aspects of Fennomania writing numerous plays and works in Finnish and working as a journalist and editor for the newspaper Kanawa. The newspaper was considered as the Finnish version of the Swedish language newspaper Saima which at the time was run by Johan Vilhelm Snellman. The Kanawa newspaper was published in Vyborg between 1845 and 1847. It dealt with religious and state (political) issues. Snellmann, who was a prominent Fennoman philosopher, often translated articles from Hannikainen‚Äôs Kanawa and printed them in Saima. Kanawa was closed down by the authorities in 1847. Hannikainen later contributed to several newspapers, such as Suometar Uusi Suomi, of which he was the editor-in-chief until 1848. His play Silm√§nk√§√§nt√§j√§, ie Jussi Oluvisen matka H√∂lm√∂l√§√§n (The Conjurer, ie Jussi Oluvisen‚Äôs travel to Foolsville), the very first publicly presented play in Finnish language, was first performed in Lappeenranta in 1846 and then in Kuopio in 1847. Hannikainen already wrote the play end of 1830, when he was working as a surveyor's assistant in H√∂lm√∂l√§ village in Ruokolahti. In total, Hannikainen wrote nine plays, four of which were unpublished. Hannikainen also wrote poems and translated numerous works including plays by authors such as Ludvig Holberg, William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes. The words he forged or introduced into the general Finnish language are modern, guardian, publicity, profitability, gaze, accounting, accountant, craftsman, business, sales, council, name (verb), act (verb), pre-school, people‚Äôs school, learning school (see Education in Finland), share (noun), dividend, purchase, print, protocol, heroism, commit, conjugate (words), financial, commission (noun), wholesaler, future, import, photograph, vice judge (varatuomari), society, community and vowel.

Education Sharpe was educated at De La Salle College, Sheffield (now All Saints Catholic High School, Sheffield) (1967-1974). He holds a BA in Biology from the University of York (1977) and a PhD from the University of Sheffield (1981). Research Following his doctoral work at the University of Sheffield, Sharpe continued as a postdoctoral researcher there and also at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Cambridge prior to his first academic appointment at the University of Manchester (1997). Sharpe's research focuses on cell differentiation and began with his doctoral work on differentiation of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum but he extended this work to mammalian tissues, principally bone. In this early work he applied the technique of thin layer countercurrent distribution. Subsequently, through the study of mouse embryo differentiation and the role of homeobox sequences in DNA, his work has mainly been applied to the field of craniofacial development. Most recently he has been leading research into the possibility of tooth regeneration and the development of new biological-based treatments for tooth repair. Sharpe is author of Methods of Cell Separation. Awards and recognition Sharpe is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh (2010) and a recipient of the Gregor Mendel Memorial Medal (2003). He was awarded the Craniofacial Biology Research Award by the International Association for Dental Research (2004) and 2018 he received the William J Gies award for best publication is Biomaterials and Bioengineering (2018). Personal life Sharpe (stage name Paul Shaft) is a musician and was a pioneer of the Sheffield punk music and new wave music scene. Originally he played bass guitar in the Sheffield band 2.3 and then formed the avante garde band De Tian.

Cancellier was born in Dunkirk in 1580 and entered the Abbey of Dunes in 1597. He went on to serve as bursar, and on 30 July 1610 was elected abbot in succession to the late Andreas du Chesne. The monastery had been badly damaged in the Dutch Revolt, and Cancellier attempted a renovation of the remaining buildings, financing it by selling off parts of the medieval ruins as building materials. He also encouraged young monks to study theology. By the time of his death, the monastic community had grown to 49 in number.

Written in Python its main focus is on local-control and privacy. It has a very wide range of device support, and as of May 2020 it features support for over 1600 modular plug-ins or add-ons with system integrations to different IoT technologies, systems and services are available as \\"integration components\\". Actions, such as locally or remotley controlling lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances, can be triggered by automations and scripts, voice commands, mobile apps, or controlled via the Home Assistant web-based user-interface (front-end). The Home Assistant project started in September 2013. In November 2013, the core functionality was first published on GitHub. , it has over 1930 developers who have contributed to its core. The project has free and open source companion apps for both Android and iOS (iPhone and iPad). At the GitHub \\"State of the Octoverse\\" in 2019 it listed Home Assistant as the tenth biggest open source project on GitHub based on the number of active contributors that year (as the project had contributions from 63,000+ contributors during 2019).  Features  Home Assistant acts as a smart home controller hub which features all common functions that you would expect from a home automation platform to control simple smart home technology, advanced building automation, alarm management of security alarms and home security systems, and monitoring of energy measuring devices (home energy monitors as well as central smart meters) and other sensors. It provides action and scripts rule-based systems for creating automations, with time and event condition handling, scheduling tasks, notifications and voice control, as well as functions for direct and on-demand actions. It is deployed as an on-premises software and can connect directly or indirectly to IoT (Internet of Things) local devices, local control hubs/gateways/bridges, or cloud services from many different vendors, including other open and closed smart home ecosystems. It features modular system integration system with \\"integration components\\" (plug-ins or add-ons) for most popular devices, services, and IoT ecosystems, such as; Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Bluetooth, ecobee, Google Assistant, Google Cast (Google Chromecast), Google Home, Google Nest, IFTTT, IKEA Smart Home (Tr√•dfri), KNX, Xiaomi Smart Home (Mi Home), MQTT, Philips Hue, SmartThings (Samsung), Sonoff (eWeLink, official DIY-mode, and third-party firmware), Sonos, Tuya Smart, X10, Zigbee, Z-Wave, several smart locks from Yale/August and others, and many other third-party system integrations. = Installation = Home Assistant Core is a Python program that can be deployed on servers running various operating systems, although the name has also been used to refer to an official software appliance / virtual appliance installation package that combines the Home Assistant Core, a just enough operating system, and various other tools. This setup allows one to run it easily on a single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi, a virtual machine on a hypervisor (available in many modern network-attached storage systems), and other hardware platforms without setting up an operating system first. It has a management user interface that can be used from the Home Assistant frontend, that interface is otherwise not present in a Home Assistant Core only setup. = Discovery and configuration = After installation, Home Assistant scans your home network and discovers devices that can be included in the smart home solution. Users can provide credentials and device names via an administration user interface.  Security  Home Assistant's on-premises software nature and local control focus, plus the fact that it is an open source application, have been described as beneficial to the security of the platform, specifically when compared to closed home automation systems based on proprietary hardware and cloud-services services.  Reception  Home Assistant took second place in 2017 and 2018 for the Thomas Krenn Award (formerly Open Source Grant), later winning first place in 2019. Home Assistant also won an DINACon award in 2018 for their \\"Open Internet Award\\" category., as well as being a nominee for the same awards in 2013 Home Assistant was also included in a number of product and platform comparisons, where, like many other non-commercial home automation controllers/hubs, it has often in the past been criticized for forcing users into a tedious file-based setup procedure using text-based YAML markup- language instead of graphical user interfaces. However, newer versions of Home Assistant have also made it much easier to perform a standard installation from scratch and quickly get started compared to earlier versions, as the core development team have for the latest couple of years been putting a lot of time and effort into making Home Assistant more user-friendly to new and less advanced home automation users. Thus the team have increasingly moved its configuration settings from its YAML setup files to the latest revisions of its web-based graphical user interface.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in 1931. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by Craig Titley and directed by Eric Laneuville. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode continues the 1930s setting of the season premiere with guest stars Patton Oswalt and Darren Barnet also returning from that episode. It features an early version of the super soldier serum from the MCU film Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and includes references to several characters from that film. \\"Know Your Onions\\" originally aired on ABC on June 3, 2020, and was watched by 1.50 million viewers. The episode received less positive reviews than the previous one, with critics highlighting several contrivances in the story and the disappointing end to the episode's central dilemma of whether to defeat Hydra or allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to be formed. Plot Following the events of \\"The New Deal\\", S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie and Agent Deke Shaw convince Freddy Malick to let them protect him from the Chronicoms while he delivers the package he received so they can maintain history. Meanwhile, Agents Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson, and Jemma Simmons regroup at Ernest \\"Hazard\\" Koenig's speakeasy so they can interrogate Freddy's contact, Viola; learning she is an agent of Hydra and that Malick is delivering what will become the organization's super soldier serum. Due to Malick's involvement and having deduced where he is going, Koenig insists that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents let him come with them, so they reluctantly bring him to their mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, just as their ally Enoch attempts to prevent an erratic Agent Melinda May from leaving. Coulson talks her down, but she responds apathetically to his being an LMD, much to the others' concerns. Koenig helps direct the team to Freddy's delivery location, learning of S.H.I.E.L.D., robotics, and time travel in the process. Once they are within communication range, Johnson tries to tell Shaw to kill Malick to prevent Hydra's rise in the future, but Mack orders him not to. Shaw ultimately spares Malick's life just as a group of Chronicoms attack them. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents fight them off while Koenig and Enoch find Malick so the former can convince him not to make the delivery. Malick shoots his boss in the arm and leaves with a Hydra agent, securing their future as the Chronicoms are forced to leave due to a closing time window. Due to Zephyr Ones time drive, the agents unexpectedly jump through time in order to follow the Chronicoms, leaving Enoch behind. Despite this, a recovering Koenig hires him to become his new bartender in exchange for information on how he, his speakeasy, and his descendants will go on to help S.H.I.E.L.D. in the future. ProductionDevelopment= After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D., beginning in 1930s New York prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"Know Your Onions\\" and written by Craig Titley. It was confirmed to be the second episode of the season in May 2020, when Eric Laneuville was revealed to have directed it. =Writing= The episode picks up from the end of the season premiere, which set up a twist where the characters have to save Hydra in order to save S.H.I.E.L.D. This was devised as complex moral decision for the agents to debate that would create conflict within the team. Bell compared the decision to the question of would one kill baby Adolf Hitler if they could. Star Clark Gregg felt this was an interesting idea for the series to explore, saying, \\"Removing the challenge that makes S.H.I.E.L.D. become what it is, does put us in a funny position, but I think it‚Äôs a great idea and I‚Äôm excited too for people to see the way it plays out.\\" Darren Barnet, who portrays Freddy Malick, described \\"Know Your Onions\\" as \\"more my episode\\" following his introduction in the previous episode. The character Deke has to directly deal with the dilemma of killing the character Freddy Malick to prevent Hydra from forming, or letting him live to ensure that S.H.I.E.L.D. is formed. Coincidentally, actor Jeff Ward was studying the \\"Baby Hitler conundrum\\" in an online Yale University course about morality at the same time as he was working on the episode. He described the situation as \\"all theory. There isn't a hard and fast answer for it until you're dealing with the repercussions of your actions.\\" Patton Oswalt ends the episode with the line \\"Enoch, this looks like the start of a marvelous friendship.\\" This is a reference to a similar line in Casablanca (1942) that Oswalt ad-libbed on set. Titley used an online dictionary that had phrases from the 1920s and 1930s to help with the dialogue in the episode. Regarding the phrase \\"know your onions\\", it made Titley laugh, and he thought it \\"sounded like what was happening in the story\\". Regarding the erratic nature of Melinda May, Titley said the writers knew she would be hypersensitive to emotions as revealed later in the season but they \\"didn't want to come out of the gate with that\\" and make it a process, so she is shown in her \\"adjustment phase\\", having a colder personality than usual. This was justified because much of May's interaction was with the Chronicom Enoch, who does not exhibit emotions for her to read. =Casting= With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova- Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. Guest stars in the episode include Joel Stoffer as Enoch, Tobias Jelinek as Luke, Darren Barnet as Wilfred \\"Freddy\\" Malick, Nora Zehetner, and Patton Oswalt as Ernest Hazard Koening; all return from the previous episode. =Design= Like the season premiere, \\"Know Your Onions\\" again features a Film noir-styled title card to reflect the 1930s setting. Costume designer Whitney Galitz called Deke's costume in the episode the most complicated, eventually giving him a brown leather jacket that Galitz and Ward felt was perfect for the character. The jacket was vintage, and Galitz thought it would work for this episode and the previous, unaware that Ward would have stunt sequences in this episode. As such, Galitz reached out to a leather worker to create a replica that Ward could wear during his stunts. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= The vial of green liquid that Freddy is tasked with delivering for Hydra in the episode is revealed to be part of the formula for the super soldier serum created by German scientist Abraham Erskine and first used by Hydra's leader, Johann Schmidt / Red Skull. These characters and events are depicted in the MCU film Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). When Freddy survives the episode and successfully delivers the vial to Hydra, the events of the film are able to take place unaltered in the timeline. Release \\"Know Your Onions\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on June 3, 2020. ReceptionRatings= In the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.50 million viewers. Both metrics were roughly even with the previous episode's ratings share and viewership performance. Within a week of release, \\"Know Your Onions\\" was watch by 2.53 million viewers. =Critical response= Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Alex McLevy gave it a \\"B-\\", describing it as \\"entertaining but somewhat messy\\". He felt Koenig and Enoch had the best dialogue of the episode, and also felt the scenes Deke and Mack on the train with Freddy were effective. McLevy would have liked the season to explore the 1930s setting more rather than the quick wrap-up in this episode which led to several \\"large elements falling apart\\". These included Simmons finding some of the super soldier serum on the Hydra agent's shoe, and Daisy telling Deke to kill Freddy which McLevy felt was out of character for her. On that point, he concluded that \\"the whole moral dilemma of whether to protect Malick or take him down felt forced and clunky, with one side the obvious right choice.\\" Michael Ahr at Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars, also feeling that Daisy's choice was out of character but praising the MCU connections, action sequences, and time travel elements. Ahr felt those points made up for the episode's \\"moral and psychological conundrums\\" that made the episode less exciting than others, along with the train scenes which he felt were repetitive. Both McLevy and Ahr noted that the scenes with May and Yo-Yo appeared to be setting up future stories for them and hoped that those would not be dragged out much longer. Writing for Bam! Smack! Pow!, Wesley Coburn gave the episode a \\"B-\\", saying the episode \\"mostly served as filler to really get the characters into position for their first main action of the story\\". Syfy Wires Trent Moore felt the episode had \\"big twists [and] wild action\\" and felt knowing the liquid Freddy was carrying would eventually lead to the super soldier serum that creates Captain America raised some \\"really fun questions about time travel.\\" Michal Schick of Hypable thought the episode was fun, particularly highlighting the period costumes, but said it was \\"pretty rough around the edges\\". Schick criticized the lack of explanation for the team having to time travel at the end of the episode, and found the conclusion to the Freddy dilemma disappointing. He did think the scenes between May and Enoch in the episode were \\"painful but delightful\\". ReferencesExternal links *\\"Know Your Onions\\" at ABC * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
