District, in the South Island of New Zealand. It is located northeast of Danseys Pass, some 30 kilometres northwest of Oamaru. It is located immediately north of the boundary to Otago. Originally named Ramsey, the name was changed to the current Livingstone in the 1870s. The settlement was home to the nearby Livingstone gold fields, which proved to be an uneconomic venture. Although gold was, and still is, found, the fine nature of its makeup proved to be hard to accumulate. The Livingstone gold company went broke in the 1920s. The evidence of gold mining in the area is still very evident, with slucings and water races still very prominent. Today Livingstone is a small township, with no services.

It went on sale in 2011, with first deliveries later that summer. Its V4 engine was derived from the successful VFR800. While the VFR800 was a sport touring motorcycle, the Crossrunner has a low saddle, wide-handlebars, long-travel suspension, and special Pirelli Scorpion tires better suited to \\"soft roads\\".  Development  Honda commissioned a European design team to assist in development. Preliminary tests included trying various Crossrunner prototypes in over 120 wind tunnel sessions to establish an optimum design for aerodynamic stability. In September 2014, Honda Motor Europe announced that the 2015 Crossrunner, to be called the VFR800X, would have a revised 800 cc V4 engine and new bodywork. Also, there would be changes to the suspension, brakes and wheels.  Reception  A Motor Cycle News (MCN) review said: \\"The Crossrunner stands out from the crowd and performs as a real world, day-in, day-out bike impressively well.\\" Journalist Kevin Ash added: \\"It's a fine looking bike with a reassuring and satisfying chassis matched to a characterful and muscular engine that compels you to use it. But there's a downside, and these days it's a big one: fuel consumption.\\" In an MCN 5-bike review in 2015, the testers felt that the Yamaha MT-09 Tracer was a better bike and better value than all its competitors, namely: a Triumph Tiger 800XRx, a Triumph Tiger Sport, a Honda Crossrunner, and a Ducati Hyperstrada.Motorcycle News 26 August 2015 With a kerb weight of 242kg, the Crossrunner was significantly the heaviest of the group.

The municipality is now included in the Drava Statistical Region.Ru≈°e municipal site Name Fala was mentioned in written sources in 1245 as in domo Volmari (and as de Valle in 1279, Vall and Valle in 1289, and Fall in 1495). The name is of unclear origin, although the initial F- indicates a German origin. It could be derived from Old High German falo 'yellowish' (referring to soil or water color) or from valle 'trap' (referring to hunting activity). Derivation from Latin vallis 'valley' is unlikely because the area was not under Romance influence.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 133. History South of the settlement, where the railroad enters a tunnel on the way to Ru≈°e, there are the remains of a German bunker from the Second World War. During the war, Partisan forces dynamited the railroad line a number of times. On the night of 28 September 1944, the Partisans' Jo≈æe Lacko Detachment attacked the German post at the hydroelectric plant, killing 10 German troops and releasing a large quantity of oil into the Drava River.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1980.

It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1245, but most of the current building, including the castle chapel, dates to the 16th and 17th century with major 19th-century reconstruction.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 6350 The structure originally belonged to St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavant Valley. It was destroyed by Hungarian forces in 1259, and a new structure was built in 1290. The castle was additionally fortified in the 16th century due to the danger of Ottoman attacks. It was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 17th century, when it also housed a school for priests. The castle came under state ownership with the dissolution of the monastery in 1782, and was then purchased by the Liebmann von Rast family in 1822. A chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas was part of the castle. The last owners before the Second World War were Count Alfonz Zabeo and his son-in-law Pavel Glanƒçnik.

Life He was the second son of John Cosby of Great Leake, Nottingham.Francis Cosby (1510-80), Stradbally, Queen's County and the Tudor conquest of Leinster He settled in Ireland in the reign of Henry VIII. He was active in fighting on the edge of the English Pale, and was commended by the Lord Deputies Edward Bellingham and Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. In 1558 Cosby was appointed general of the Kerne, and in 1562 was granted the suppressed abbey of Stradbally in Queen's County. In 1565 he became governor of Port Laoise, and seneschal of Queen's County. He helped to massacre, although the degree of his responsibility is not clear, many of the O'Mores at Mullaghmast, near Athy, who had been summoned to the fortress on avowedly peaceful business. The date 1577 in the Annals of the Four Masters is contradicted in the Annals of Lough C√© which says 1567. Cosby was not successful in repression in Queen's County. Rory Oge O'More was continually threatening him, and took his eldest son prisoner in 1577. The murder of Rory in the following year relieved Cosby; but the outbreak of the Desmond rebellion in 1580 saw him killed by the rebels at the battle of Glenmalure, 25 August 1580. Family He was married to Lady Mary Seymour, daughter of Lord Protector Somerset., by whom he had three sons, Alexander, Henry, and Arnold. He married Elizabeth Palmer, by whom he had one daughter. Alexander succeeded to the estates, received additional grants in Queen's County, and was, with his son Francis, killed at the battle of Stradbally Bridge. The estates subsequently passed to Richard, another son of Alexander, whose descendants still possess them. Arnold, Francis Cosby's second son, served under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in the Low Countries.

It is usually built either as an architectural ornament for purely decorative purposes or else for the practical housing of a clock, a bell or an observation platform. Its function is thus different from that of a roof lantern, despite a frequent similarity of external appearance. It can have a flat roof but usually has a pointed roof or other kind of apex over. When the height of a roof turret exceeds its width it is usually called a tower or steeple in English architecture, and when the height of a ridge turret's roof exceeds its width, it is called a spire in English architecture or a fl√®che in French architecture.

It provided a focus for research, public interest advocacy and education on issues of law and policy arising from digital transactions in cyberspace. It ceased to operate sometime after mid-2016. Description The founding sponsors were Baker & McKenzie, an international law firm, and its original name was the Baker & McKenzie Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre. In 2005, with Australian Research Council research project funding, the name was shortened. The centre's work dealt with subjects like privacy and freedom of information in digital records, cloud computing and Web 2.0 issues, content regulation and the interests of young people, e-commerce, provision of government services by Internet, online bankings, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the use of encryption, Internet governance, intellectual property in digital artefacts, and decision-making technologies in public administration. Much of the centre's work concerned Australian law and policy, but there was also a focus on the development of cyberspace regulation in Asia, the fastest growing part of cyberspace's \\"terrestrial footprint\\". There was at time also increasing interest in jurisdictional and other issues created by personal and other data stored outside a person's home country in \\"the cloud\\". The Centre collaborated with lawyers and legal researchers in a range of other firms and organisations, including as Research Associates. It also enabled experienced external researchers to visit, and students to do internships or volunteer.  Research projects  Some of the centre's research projects include the following: = Net Filtering & Young People= This research project looked at Internet filtering and censorship proposals developed by recent Australian governments. It generated materials from workshops in 2008 and 2009, and an extensive references list covering those years. It involved collaboration with the UNSW Journalism and Media Research Centre. = Unlocking IP = Unlocking IP: New models for sharing and trading IP: \\"Unlocking IP\\" is a research project supported by a 2005-2009 ARC Linkage grant to a consortium led by Graham Greenleaf, contributions from industry partners, and hosted by the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre. As well as hosting a library of publications, and events such as Unlocking IP conferences in 2004, 2006, and 2009, the project and its participants also: * hosted the House of Commons Blog, * co-hosted the launch of the Creative Commons licence Australian version, and the Free for Education open content licences, * supported the work of several PhD candidates, including a development of tools to survey the extent of open content licences used online, and * saw a number of spin-off projects, including work: for Consumers International on the 2006 Copyright Act amendments legalising format-shifting (e.g. iPod) and time-shifting (e.g. TiVo) in Australia, and for the Copyright Agency Ltd, on Orphan Works. = Interpreting Privacy Principles= \\"Interpreting Privacy Principles\\" was a research project led by Greenleaf subtitled \\"Creating more consistent privacy principles through better interpretation and law reform: an Australasian initiative to resolve an international problem - comparative research into privacy principles.\\" It was supported by an ARC Discovery grant 2006‚Äì2009 to a research team based at the centre. As well as a number of events, such as the symposium International perspectives on privacy regulation: Privacy Principles in Asia Pacific economies compared at UNSW on 3‚Äì4 March 2010, numerous publications and submissions such as those to the 2008 ALRC review of privacy law in Australia, the project also supported the Asia Pacific Privacy Charter, work on the APEC Privacy Framework, and the proposed but abandoned national ID card system known as the Access Card. = Regulating Online Investing= \\"One Day, We‚Äôll All Invest This Way! Regulating Online Investing\\" is an ARC Discovery research project led by Dimity Kingsford Smith from UNSW, with collaborators from Monash and ANU. The Centre developed and hosted the project's online and offline resources, including a \\"Selected References\\" list. Despite the encouragement for individual investors to go online and trade securities, when the project started there had been limited research into the regulatory implications of the non-advisory context of their decision making. Further, outside the United States, there were no significant treatments of the regulation of electronic trading platforms. This Australian Research Council funded project addressed these deficiencies, particularly in relation to Australian online investing.

Design and development The Skyeton Swift is a conventionally laid out single-engine, high-wing light aircraft with side-by-side seating for two. The wings have constant chord, each braced with a single lift strut to the lower fuselage longeron. They use a single metal spar and have stressed skin metal upper surfaces and leading edges, combined with fabric covered lower surfaces aft of the spar. Fabric covered ailerons and inboard slotted flaps together occupy the whole of the wing trailing edges. The wings carry 2.17¬∞ dihedral.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 75. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485XTacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 80. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The Swift's fuselage is built around four welded steel longerons and skinned with composite materials. Behind the cabin the fuselage diameter decreases markedly to the tail. The fin leading edge and the rudder hinge are both strongly swept but the trailing edge of the rudder, which carries an electrically operated trim tab, is only slightly swept. The tailplane and single piece elevator, also tabbed, are set well back, with the tailplane leading edge behind the rudder hinge. A small triangular underfin provides more vertical stabilizer area. A fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the lower fuselage with cantilever legs. The wheels are spatted and the nosewheel steerable. The Swift can be fitted with one of two Rotax 912 flat- four engines: the 59 kW (79 hp) 912UL or the 74 kW (99 hp) 912ULS. Both engines drive three-bladed propellers. The Swift first flew in October 2006 and was developed into two versions. The first, designated K-10(02) Swift or ULM (ultra leger motorise), is aimed at the French ultralight market and gained French approval in 2009. The second version is targeted at the North American market and designated K-10(01) or LSA (for the US Light Sport Aircraft category). This has a wingspan increase of 600 mm, greater fuel capacity and a higher maximum take-off weight. As of May 2019, the Swift is no longer mentioned on the manufacturer's website, indicating production was terminated.https://skyeton.com/ Operational history Eight Swifts are on the Ukrainian civil register, one on the Russian and six more on the French register.

A descendant of Lebanese immigrants, he is known for his work on neurosurgery and for the precursor of the modern valve treatment for hydrocephalus.  Early life  Although his parents wanted him to learn how to play any musical instrument, Hakim instead showed interest and curiosity for science in his early childhood, specially physics and electricity. It is said that he locked himself in his room to make electric circuits and build radios at the age of 12. He finished high school at Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom√©, in Bogot√°, Colombia. At 22 years of age, Hakim started medical school at Universidad Nacional in Bogot√°, but his passion for electricity continued and led him to perform research in electrical output during digestion, the effects of low voltage on womb contraction, and the calcium formation stimulation by electrolysis. He later travelled to the United States to continue his medical studies in Neurosurgery in 1950, and Neuropathology in 1954.  Career and Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus  During his Research fellowship, Dr. Hakim performed autopsies of Alzheimer Disease patients and with other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). He noted that the majority of the cases their brain ventricles were enlarged without destruction of the brain cortex. However, nobody was able to explain the reason why, which led Hakim's curiosity to research more back in Colombia. In 1957, he finally realized that these patients suffered from what is now known as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) after finding a 16-year- old live patient with this condition. He published his work in 1964 and called Dr. Raymond Adams to share his discovery, but Adams rejected his idea. Months later, a US consular employee in Colombia suffering from the same condition came to his practice. Hakim proposed to treat him by taking some cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as he had treated the young patient. But skeptically, the family rejected it and wanted to go back to the United States for treatment. Hakim, convinced that nobody would be able to treat her there, decided to fly with them. At the Massachusetts General Hospital, he treated the patient, who had a sudden incredible improvement. After seeing this, Dr. Adams got interested in Hakim's work and published Dr. Hakim's discovery, taking some of the credit for this amazing finding. This concept of NPH opened the door to other research including the treatment of dementia in the elderly. Hakim continued working on NPH and for many years he has researched the mechanics of the intracranial cavity and CSF.  The Invention of the valve  The first valve to treat Hydrocephalus was introduced in 1949 by Spitz, but this valve had several disadvantages which sometimes risked the patient's life. Knowing this and working in his home shop in Bogot√°, Hakim improved and developed a unidirectional valve with the capacity to regulate the CSF pressure by adding a spring pressure control in a stainless steel cone and synthetic ruby ball. This valve was much safer, and it was introduced to the medical community in 1966. Despite of all medical advances, all modern valves are built based on his invention. He holds more than 28 United States patents for his various inventions. Nowadays, following his father steps, Carlos, Hakim's eldest son, has continued his father's research in neurosurgery and engineering. Carlos, with the collaboration of his father, has recently developed a programmable and adjustable (through the skin) valve which may prevent ventricular collapse when the pressure of the CSF is too low.  Other Achievements and Legacy  Hakim's findings and inventions brought him global recognition. He has been invited and has given lectures in more than 85 Neurosurgery conferences around the planet in 33 different countries, in Europe (specially England and France), Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea and Middle East countries) as well as the whole American continent. He held 45 English publications (7 of them in the New England Journal) to complete 70 in other languages.[3, 4] He also worked as a professor for Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, and La Universidad Javeriana in Colombia as well as being the director of the Neurosurgeon Department in the Military Hospital in Bogot√°. In 2010, Dr Hakim got an award from the Hydrocephalus Association in its annual conference in Cleveland, the Lifetime Achievement award, for his extense contribution to the treatment and understanding of the CSF circulation and its anomalies. Nowadays, NHP is also called as \\"Hakim Syndrome\\" in honor of his accomplishments.[6] Today, 9 to 14% of elderly living in any type of assisted facility suffered from NPH.Marmarou A, Young HF, Aygok GA. Estimated incidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus and shunt outcome in patients residing in assisted-living and extended-care facilities. Neurosurg Focus. 2007;22(4):1‚Äì7 However, and despite the fact that this disorder was discovered in the late 1950s, and published in the mid 1960s, much more remains unknown, and NPH is sometimes misdiagnosed. However, thanks to Dr. Hakim, the curiosity of many researches in the world is awakened, which results in many publications about NPH. Today, more is known about this disease, but there is still much more to be known.  Death  Hakim died surrounded by his family in a Foundation Santa Fe Hospital in Bogota due to a hemorrhagic stroke.

At the end of 2007 Godsheide counted 3,143 inhabitants. Between the village and the main town of Hasselt there are several large modern developments - the Hasselt golf club, the Grenslandhallen entertainment centre, the Limburg provincial government buildings, and the Kinepolis cinema complex. Apart from the rest of Hasselt, it is bounded by Diepenbeek on the east, and Bokrijk, a part of Genk, to the north. The parish is divided in northern and southern sections by the waterways and roads which both run east‚Äìwest through it. The Albert Canal separates the modern main village from a northern section, \\"Vosseberg\\", which has access to the main village via two bridges, while the southern extreme of the parish, \\"Wolske\\", lies to the south of the Demer and the nearby Universiteitslaan main road. At the southern extremity, Godsheide touches the old steenweg (old main road) between Hasselt and Maastricht, which also runs in an east‚Äìwest manner. Godsheide VV is the local soccer club, and there is a local catholic primary school and a scouts group. Etymology Although the modern spelling and standard pronunciation sounds like it means \\"God's heath\\" this is not the origin of the name of Godsheide. The original meaning is thought to be shown more clearly by the spelling Goetschey, found on a map from 1549, and the dialect pronunciation of the name, which is Goo√®tsk√®: instead of God's heide (heath) the second component was related to modern Dutch scheiding (a separation or dividing). The division being referred to was apparently that between the medieval territory of the County of Loon, which included Hasselt, and Diepenbeek, which was not part of Loon, but rather formed a detached part of various other entities over the centuries, especially the Prince-bishopric of Li√®ge and the Duchy of Brabant.  History The oldest roads were made in the 14th century, and were the Bos, Kiezel, and Wolskes streets in the south of the parish, and the Brugbemdenstraat which is now in the golf course. The two ponds on Borggravevijverstraat, in the north of the parish near Bokrijk, were already there in the 15th century. The old main \\"steenweg\\" road between Hasselt and Genk, which passes through the northern \\"Vosseberg\\" part of the parish (separated from the church by the modern canal) exists since the 18th century. Godsheide became a catholic parish in 1845 and in 1853 work began on the church which is dedicated to Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Bezoeking (Our beloved lady of visitation). The modern church has an old gate which was once used elsewhere in Hasselt as an entrance port to the city. In 1869, the church received an organ which was protected in 1975 and fully restored between 1995 and 1998. = The Albert Canal = The Albert Canal (Albertkanaal) was made between 1930 and 1939, and runs through Godsheide. There is a canal lock in Godsheide. On 26 June 1939 part of the dike gave way on the new canal, which had recently been checked, and 1,3 million m¬≥ water flowed out, killing the man who had been checking it. The first bridge over the canal in Godsheide was blown up by the Belgian army during the invasion of Germany at the beginning of World War II. = Drowning disaster = During the war there was a simple ferry float constructed over the canal that was pulled across by steel cable. On 14 February 1941 a teacher had 57 children and 4 adults board on the south side, with the intention of crossing to get the tram in Genk. The float started to sink and as a result 35 children and 2 adults drowned. The town worker who operated the ferry was blamed and imprisoned. The teacher left the region.  Godsheide and its bridges  =The Cable-stayed bridge= The tuibrug in Godsheide. Godsheide has very large a cable-stayed bridge over the canal, which was intended to be part of a new link connecting Hasselt and Genk. The project was vetoed by Genk. Only one side of the bridge is maintained for the small amount of traffic it serves, and there is a very wide bicycle path. =The bridge for the A24= In Limburg there has been debate since the 1970s about building a main road running north‚Äìsouth from Eindhoven in the Netherlands to Huy in the French-speaking Province of Li√®ge to the south, and to be known as the A24. An agreement was reached in 1972, but never went ahead. The original plans would have meant the bridge should have been about 1 km to the west of the cable-stayed bridge, nearer to the centre of Hasselt.  Annual procession  In Godsheide the kermis in held on the Sunday after 18 July. On this day the scouts carry the image of Saint Odilia in procession through the town.

He is known for his contributions towards the Franco-German cooperation after World War II and for criticizing Israel. Early life His father, Paul Grosser, was born in 1880 in Berlin and died 1934 in Saint- Germain-en-Laye, France. A director of a children's hospital in Frankfurt am Main, socialist, freemason, and Jew, he was forced to immigrate to France in 1933 due to the increasing antisemitism in Nazi Germany. Alfred and his mother, Lily Grosser, were given French citizenship through a decree by the Minister of Justice, Vincent Auriol, in 1937; as a result, they were spared possible internment in a French camp following France's declaration of war on Germany, in September 1939, when, under the government of Daladier, German refugees from Nazism were treated as enemy aliens, along with other German residents.Caron, Vicki (1996). \\"The Missed Opportunity: French Refugee Policy in Wartime, 1939-40.\\" Historical Reflections / R√©flexions Historiques, 22(1), 117‚Äì157; here: p. 121.

After 1955, he became a professor at the Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris. In 1965, Grosser began contributing to many newspapers and broadcasts, including La Croix and Ouest-France. He was very involved in improving the Franco-German cooperation, and paved the road for the √âlys√©e Treaty in 1963.Martin Strickmann, L'Allemagne nouvelle contre l'Allemagne √©ternelle.

Political opinions Grosser opposed many Israeli government policies, as well as parts of the French government. When asked to describe the way his statements are received, he referred to the \\"moral cudgel\\" (Moralkeule), a phrase coined by writer Martin Walser. In 1998, when one of Walser's speeches created huge controversy, Grosser publicly sided with Walser. Grosser also holds to the opinion that Israel's politics inherently invoke anti-semitism. In 2003, Grosser left the board of magazine L‚ÄôExpress because he believed its reporting on the Middle East was unbalanced. He stated that the editor had reluctantly published his positive critique on a book that criticized Israel, while later printing multiple readers' letters attacking Grosser.Warum ich Israel kritisiere, Internationale Politik, February 2007 Alfred Grosser criticized awarding the Ludwig-B√∂rne-Prize 2007 to Henryk M.

After Maurice's Balkan campaigns (582‚Äì602) and during the subduing of the Slavs in the Balkans in the 7th and the 8th centuries, large communities were forcefully relocated to Anatolia as military units to fight the Umayyad Caliphate. History =7th century= The earliest evidence for a relocation of Slavs from the Balkans may be a seal dated to 650. In 658 and 688/9 the Byzantines invited groups of Slavic settlers to Bithynia. Constans II settled captured Slavs in Asia Minor, and 5,000 of these joined Abdulreman ibn Khalid in 664-665.Stratos (1975), p. 234 There was a town in Bithynia known as Gordoservon, mentioned in 680‚Äì81, whose name probably derived from the Serbs resettled there from the areas \\"around river Vardar\\" by Byzantine Emperor Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668), in the mid-7th century (in ca. 649 or 667). Justinian II (685-695) also settled as many as 30,000 Slavs from Thrace in Asia Minor, in an attempt to boost military strength. Most of them however, with their leader Neboulos, deserted to the Arabs at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692. =8th century= Bulgar aggression in northern Greece prompted the Byzantine state to relocate a large number of Slavs in 758 under Constantine V, and again in 783 out of fear that they would side with the Bulgars during an invasion. The Bulgar expansion caused massive Slav migrations, and in 762 more than 200,000 people fled to Byzantine territory and were relocated to Asia Minor. The most prominent among the Asia Minor Slavs was Thomas the Slav, a military commander who raised most of the empire in an unsuccessful revolt against Michael II the Amorian in the early 820s. Although the 10th-century chronicler Genesios calls him \\"Thomas from Lake Gouzourou, of Armenian race\\", most modern scholars support his Slavic descent and believe his birthplace to have been near Gaziura in the Pontus.. By the middle of the 9th century, the Asia Minor Slavs were integrated within the Bulgarian nationality.Katerina Venedikova.

The original poem was initially written by the 13th-century Sufi poet Amir Khusrow, then further modified by Bulleh Shah in the 18th century. It is said that this qawwali was adapted from the original prayer by Amir Khusrow, and was then modified completely by Bulleh Shah. Bulleh Shah gave an entirely different color to the qawwali, adding verses in praises of Shahbaz Qalandar and giving it a large tint of Sindhi culture. The poem includes a reference to the town of Sehwan, which is home to the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The word \\"Laal\\" can refer to Jhulelal as a young man, or his red dress. With origins dating back 600 years, \\"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar\\" is a popular traditional Sufi Islamic folk song across the northern Indian subcontinent as well as Iran. Various renditions of the song have been composed and performed by numerous composers and singers. Ashiq Hussain song Popular modern renditions of the song include the melody composed by Pakistani music composer Master Ashiq Hussain. Originally called \\"Lal Meri Pat\\", the song was initially composed for the 1956 Pakistani film Jabroo. It was sung by Inayat Hussain Bhatti, Fazal Hussain, and A.R. Bismil. Ashiq Hussain was reduced to poverty in later life, living in a slum at the Bazar-e- Hakiman in Lahore. When Hussain died in 2017, most Pakistanis were unaware that he was the original composer of the modern melody. Noor Jehan song The most popular modern rendition of the song, which includes Ashiq Hussain's melody, was \\"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar\\" from the 1969 Pakistani film Dillan Dey Soudey, where it was modified by Nazir Ali and sung by Noor Jehan. It was then sung by other Pakistani singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Aziz Mian, Abida Parveen, the Sabri Brothers, Reshma, Komal Rizvi, and Junoon. The song has also been performed by the Bangladeshi singer Runa Laila, and Indian artists like Hans Raj Hans, the Wadali brothers, Harshdeep Kaur, Nooran Sisters, and Mika Singh (with Yo Yo Honey Singh). Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan song Pakistani musicians Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and M. Arshad composed a new song inspired by \\"Dam Mast Qalandar\\", with a different melody and arrangement. It was sung by Khan and released as \\"Dam Mast Mast\\" in his 1991 album Mast Qalander (Vol 14). Khan also performed the song for the 1992 Pakistani film Boxer. in both Punjabi and Urdu. His song is variously called \\"Dam Mast Qalandar Mast Mast\\", \\"Dam Mast Qalandar\\" or \\"Mast Mast\\". In 2016, British-Iranian singer Sami Yusuf performed a rendition of Khan's song in his album Barakah. The Bollywood music director Viju Shah used Khan's version to produce the hit song \\"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\\" for the Bollywood film Mohra (1994), the soundtrack album of which sold more than 8million units. In turn, \\"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\\" was remade as \\"Cheez Badi\\" for the 2017 film Machine.

From Syedna Abu Bakr Siddiq, the forefathers of Pir Khaja Habib Ali Shah obtained the spiritual education (Tassawuf/Tariqat) and bestowed with Caliphat from their fathers\\"ABDULLAH\\" book written by Moulvi Abul Fayaz Mohammed Anwaruddin Siddiqui (Anwar), Hyderabad, India Early life The birth of Khwaja Habib was allegedly foretold by the Sheikh himself, who remarked that \\"his\\" son would be born in the home of Nawaab Ahmad Yar Khan (Mohi ud dowla). At this stage the mother of Khwaja Habib, Amatul Fatima was beyond child bearing age, but since the sheikh had spoken, they believed that Allah willed otherwise. In a couplet in Diwan Habib, Khwaja Habib Ali Shah exhibited love for his Sheikh Mohammed Hafiz Ali Shah Khairabadi the parental nobility and worldly life. In his discourses he explained that the love and respect for the Sheikh the spiritual master. \\"Kar Habib Apne Pidr aur na Madr pe Ghoooror, Ishq mein falan ibn falan haach hai haach\\" English Translation of the Persian couplet: \\"On your ancestry Habib be not proud aught. In the path of love So-and-So, is naught, is naught\\" As predicted by Hafiz Pir Dastagir 2 years later, a male child was born as the fourth child of Nawaab Ahmad Yar Khan, as family tradition who was named Habib Yar Khan. In Hagiography \\"Tadhkiratul Habib\\" (memorial of the beloved) by Hafiz Muhammed Fuzail Soofie Al Habibi, Durban, South Africa reported that at the time of the birth of Khwaja Habib a majzub stood at the door of the home in Kuch-e-Nasim Sultan (located near Machli Kaman near Charminar, Hyderabad) the palace of Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan (Mohi ud dowla), and pacing the floor in ecstasy repeatedly uttered \\"Shaykh Paida Shud\\" (English Translation: Sheikh has born).\\" It is to be noted according to the science of Abjad, the year of the birth of Khwaja Habib Ali Shah is \\"Ya Sayyid Habib Ali Shah Chishti\\" Four years later, the grand Sheikh Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi visited Hyderabad. He knowingly enquired from Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan, \\"Well, well was not my child born at your home?\\" Nawaab Ahmed Yar Khan replied \\"Yes\\". Hafiz Pir Dastagir asked, \\"Well have you named him\\"? The Nawaab sahib replied in the affirmative. \\"What have you named him?\\" asked the Sheikh. The Nawaab sahib replied, \\"Habib Yar Khan Bahadur\\". Hafiz Pir Dastagir was very pleased and said, \\"I have come to perform the Bismillah (Tasmi khani) ceremony of my son\\". On 23 Shawal 1240 AH at the age of four years four months and four days, Hafiz Pir proceeded with the Bismillah of the child and thereafter put the child on test. A handful of gold coins and a handful of sweetmeats were placed in front of the child and he was asked by the Sheikh to choose that which he desired. The child (Khwaja Habib) placed his hands on both and said, \\"I will take both!\\". Upon this Hafiz Pir Dastagir smiled knowingly and declared, \\"My child will choose spirituality over wealth, and will be a wealth of spirituality\\"!. After the official Bismillah ceremony, Khwaja Habib imitated the actions of his beloved Sheikh by learning and memorizing the verses, meanings and ultimately the secrets of the Quran. Discipleship Khaja Pir Habib Ali Shah became the disciple of Shaikh ul Islam Hafiz Sayed Khaja Mohammed Ali Shah Khairabadi Chishti, Quadri, Soharwardy, Naqshbandi (also known as Hafiz Pir Dastagir), who was the Calipha of Khwaja Suleman Tawsawi of Punjab, India (Now in Pakistan). Education and training At this tender age Khwaja Habib formally began the process of acquiring external as well as internal knowledge. By the age of six, Khwaja Habib would retire to the garden house, in a state of wudu, facing qiblah, covering his face with a cloth and would indulge in Muraqabah, in total privacy. By the age of nine, Khwaja Habib made it a consistent practice to be in a state of wudu. The obvious signs of wilayah affected his parents and other family members. An anecdote narrated by several of his family members and Caliphas: During Id, Khwaja habib's father would listen to the requests of his children as to what they desired as gifts (iddi) on the occasion of happiness/id. When it came to the turn of Khwaja Habib tears would roll down his eyes and he would weep and request \\"My dear father, whenever you visit the Khaqah of my beloved Pir-o-Murshid (Sheikh){Hafiz Pir Dastagir}, grant me the privilege of accompanying you.\\". After studying the Quran and the acquisition of the basic knowledge of Shariat, Khwaja Habib was formally initiated into Tariqa by Al Marifah Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir) Khairabadi. Khwaja Habib took the bayath on the hands of his Pir at the age of sixteen years six months and eleven days on 30 Moharram ul Haram 1252 H. In one of the verses in Habibul Talibun Khwaja Habib explains the feelings As: \\"Hum ko Hafiz ki Gali ka woh taswur banddha, Showk Janat na raha bagh Irum bhool gaye\\" English Translation of the Persian couplet: \\"In the thought of Hafiz's alley I was so lost, Desire for heaven, the Gardens of Irum I forgot\\" Habib Ali Shah in his own words reported by his Calipha Shah Mohammed Ibrahim Soofie Habibi (whose Dargah Shareef is at Ajmer Shareef India). Afer Bayat I persistently requested from my parents to send me to the Khanqah of my Sheikh Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir, but would receive no response from them. During that period a group of my spiritual brothers (Pir Bhais) was planning to visit the Sheikh in Khairabad. I secretly sent a petitionary letter by the hand of Hazrat Mirza Sardar Baig Sahib (whose Dargah Shareef is in Hyderbad, India). When the entourage arrived in Khairabad, Hafiz Pir Dastagir was conducting a lesson. The entourage kissed his feet and musfah Hafiz Pir Dastagir adjourned the class (lesson) and asked whether all was well. Everyone replied in the affirmative, having completely forgotten about the letter in the excitement of their arrival at the Khanqah of their Pir. Finally Hafiz Pir Dastagir himself was compelled to ask, \\"Is there anything else? Is there no letter for me?\\" At that moment my letter came to mind and was presented to Hafiz Pir Dastagir. It is narrated that Hafiz Pir came forward, took the letter placed it on his head, held it to his chest, and wept profusely. After a while Hafiz Pir Dastagir regained his composure and opening his arms as if motioning to someone declared resolutely, \\"I will call him here \\" ! The highlights of this incident stated in the following verse by Khwaja Habib in his diwan : \\"Shukr kya uska baja laya Habib Assi - Ho gaya paesh nazar ye sag darban ka qat\\" English Translation of the Persian couplet: \\"How can gratitude be shown by Habib the sinner. Before his eyes was presented the lowly servant's letter\\" The letter was taken and placed by Hafiz Pir Dastagir in his top pocket. Khwaja Habib Ali Shah narrates in Diwan: Naam sun ke wo Habib Ashiq Ka - Padh ke phir jaayb mein rakha Kagaz English Translation of the Persian couplet: Hearing the name of Habib the lover, In his pocket he kept the letter. Khaja Pir Habib Ali Shah performed Hajj (in the year ) Khaja Pir Habib Ali Shah spent years in the presence of Khaja Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi, in order to learn and gain the spiritual benefits (manasik), ultimately he was bestowed with the vision by the karam of Allah. Books taught in Khanqa Habibia He established Khanqas (schools) in several cities of India. He was the focal point for the people from various religions, caste, creeds, colours, languages. They obtained his advise in spiritual development and understanding the Islam in right perspective. He used to conduct classes of dars Quran and Hadis Nabawi. Great attention was placed by him on the acquisition of knowledge of Sharia and of the intricate teachings of Tariqah. Lessons were not only given from the classical works of Awliay Allah such as ‚ÄúFasusu Al Hikam‚Äù, ‚ÄúRuh Ar Arwah‚Äù, ‚ÄúMathanawi Shareef Moualana Rome ra‚Äù, ‚ÄúJazb al Qulub‚Äù, ‚ÄúKash al Mahjoub of Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh ra‚Äù, ‚ÄúKashkol-e-Kalimi of Hazrat Shah Kaleem Ullah Shahanjebad wali ra‚Äù and various other classical works, but some of his own books‚Äô such as Habib ul Talibun were specifically taught at the Khanqah. Poetry He wrote poetry in several languages: Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Kokani. His poetry of Hindi, Persian and Urdu is still sung by Qawals. His poetry contains homage to his Pir (Master) and other Sufi Saints of his order such as Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani and Khawajah Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, India. One of his famous Urdu Couplet \\"Hamari Kuchi bhi Nathi Haqeeqat, Tumhare Dar se mili hain Izzat, Kharab hoone na dejo Sahib, Tumare dar ka bana huwa hunn\\" English translation: \\"We were nothing in reality, from your door we have attained dignity Sir, Let us not ruined, At your door we have been fashioned.\\" Books written He authored 30+ books in different languages but now being translated in Urdu and English by his disciples. He designed syllabus and methodology for the teachings in Khanqas which are still practiced and admired. A possible module of ‚ÄúTheoretical Tasawwauf‚Äù could read like this and then a practical approach is done by the Pir (master) himself for disciples (Mureedin). * Aqiqadah of Ahl Al Sunnah wal Jamaa‚Äôh Dealing particularly with the contentious issues such as Tasawassul, Nida, Nadhr, Visitation of the Tombs of Awliay Allah, Urs of Awliay Allah are well defined in Habibul Inam. * The Etiquette of Discipleship: Respect, character development, conviction (yaqin) in the Murshid (Master), proper modes of conduct, basic house rules at a deverish lodge are defined in Habib al Talibun * Mujahada against the Nafs and Shaytan: Fighting off evil suggestions, resistance to succumbing to the temptations of the ego, fighting carnal basal desires, anger management, evils of arrogance, envy, ostentation, backbiting, slander, gluttony, apathy, refraining from Haram (restricted actions of Islam), are some of the topics that ‚ÄúHabib un Nasf fi Raddil Khnnas‚Äù and ‚ÄúHabibul Inam‚Äù addresses. * Character Building & Personality Development: Beautifying one‚Äôs demeanour, speech, actions, imbuing sincerity, humility, tolerance, compassion, concern for the welfare of others, gratitude, patience are all fundamental lessons that ‚ÄúHabibul Muridin‚Äù discusses. * Spiritual Practices: Litanies, Nafl Salah (extra prayers), prescribed prayers Adhkar, Ashgal, meditation (Muraqaba), and the method of its performance, pitfalls of and obstacles in the path are taught in ‚ÄúHabibil Awrad‚Äù and ‚ÄúHabibul Adhkar‚Äù. * Mystic Poetry and Literature: Besides Mathnawi of Moulana Rumi, Diwan-e-Habib, Habibul Irshad, Fawaid Al Fuad, Awarif al Marif are some of the books that were widely read and studied.

Doc. No. 212, (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1898), vol. V, p. 5079; United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vol. XXVIII, p. 222 , (2007). The Nicaragua‚ÄìCosta Rica San Juan River border dispute was a series of periodical conflicts between the Costa Rica and Nicaragua over the correct delimitation of their common border at its east-end, and the interpretation of the navigation rights on the San Juan River established in the Ca√±as-Jerez Treaty of 1858. The most recent disputes include an interpretation about the scope and limits of Costa Rica's rights for free navigation and Nicaragua's sovereign control over the San Juan River, which was resolved by the International Court of Justice in 2009; and the ongoing dispute that began in October 2010 regarding the dredging of San Juan River, in the area of Isla Calero. This last dispute was referred in the media as the Google Maps War. History According to the Ca√±as-Jerez Treaty of 1858, reaffirmed in arbitration by President Grover Cleveland of the United States in 1888 and interpreted by the Central American Court of Justice in 1916 (case Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Nicaragua is sovereign over the R√≠o San Juan, and Costa Rica has the right to navigate over part of the river with articles for trade which in case of need, as determined by Nicaragua can be accompanied by revenue cutters. The treaty also states that no taxes would be imposed on Costa Rican trade in goods except those accepted by mutual agreement. Historically, the possibility that the R√≠o San Juan might become the route for a Nicaragua Canal has exacerbated the dispute. The construction of the Panama Canal as well as Nicaragua's dry ecocanal project have largely deflated this motive for friction. 2009 International Court of Justice case A dispute emerged in 1998 when Nicaragua forbade the transit of Costa Rican policemen in the river, which Nicaragua claims to be a breach of sovereignty, and unilaterally imposed a tax for any Costa Rican tourists who enter the San Juan river, as persons are not objects of trade but subjects of trade and are, therefore, not covered by the treaty. This and other subjects were the subjects of a case in the International Court of Justice. On July 13, 2009, the International Court of Justice published the following ruling:Case concerning the dispute regarding navigational and related rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) , International Court of Justice, 13 July 2009 # As regards Costa Rica‚Äôs navigational rights on the San Juan river under the 1858 Treaty, in that part where navigation is common, the court finds: that Costa Rica has the right of free navigation on the San Juan river for purposes of commerce including the transport of passengers and the transport of tourists. People travelling on the San Juan river on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica‚Äôs right of free navigation are not required to obtain Nicaraguan visas or to purchase tourist cards. That the inhabitants of the Costa Rican bank of the San Juan river have the right to navigate on the river between the riparian communities for the purposes of the essential needs of everyday life which require expeditious transportation. That Costa Rica has the right of navigation on the San Juan River with official vessels used solely, in specific situations, to provide essential services for the inhabitants of the riparian areas where expeditious transportation is a condition for meeting the inhabitants‚Äô requirements. That Costa Rica does not have the right of navigation on the San Juan river with vessels carrying out police functions. That Costa Rica does not have the right of navigation on the San Juan river for the purposes of the exchange of personnel of the police border posts along the right bank of the river and of the re-supply of these posts, with official equipment, including service arms and ammunition. # As regards Nicaragua‚Äôs right to regulate navigation on the San Juan river, in that part where navigation is common, the court finds that Nicaragua has the right to require Costa Rican vessels and their passengers to stop at the first and last Nicaraguan post on their route along the San Juan River; That Nicaragua has the right to require persons travelling on the San Juan river to carry a passport or an identity document; that Nicaragua has the right to issue departure clearance certificates to Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica‚Äôs right of free navigation but does not have the right to request the payment of a charge for the issuance of such certificates; that Nicaragua has the right to impose timetables for navigation on vessels navigating on the San Juan River; that Nicaragua has the right to require Costa Rican vessels fitted with masts or turrets to display the Nicaraguan flag; # As regards subsistence fishing, the court Finds that fishing by the inhabitants of the Costa Rican bank of the San Juan river for subsistence purposes from that bank is to be respected by Nicaragua as a customary right; #As regards Nicaragua‚Äôs compliance with its international obligations under the 1858 Treaty, the court finds that Nicaragua is not acting in accordance with its obligations under the 1858 Treaty when it requires persons travelling on the San Juan River on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica‚Äôs right of free navigation to obtain Nicaraguan visas; when it requires persons travelling on the San Juan River on board Costa Rican vessels exercising Costa Rica‚Äôs right of free navigation to purchase Nicaraguan tourist cards; and when it requires the operators of vessels exercising Costa Rica‚Äôs right of free navigation to pay charges for departure clearance certificates. 2010 Isla Calero dispute The boundary between Costa Rica and Nicaragua as claimed by the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican governments, autumn 2010. Note: the area shown as \\"Calero Island\\" is not that island. On October 8, 2010, the Nicaraguan government initiated operations to dredge of the San Juan River, led by commander Ed√©n Pastora. On October 20, the Costa Rican government complained to Nicaraguan authorities regarding an alleged violation of its sovereignty, as Nicaraguan troops had entered Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica's government said that the dredging of the river caused environmental damage in the wetlands at Isla Calero, which is part of the island nature reserve, in an area that is owned by the Costa Rican Ministry of the Environment. Nicaragua rejected all claims and replied that, in fact, Costa Ricans had been invading its territory, and the Vice President of Nicaragua commented that \\"We cannot invade our own territory\\". The Costa Rican government responded by sending 70 police reinforcements to the border area on October 22. Nicaragua stationed around 50 soldiers on the island. Map, dated March 2, 1898, from the official proceedings of the binational commission presided by engineer arbitrator Gen. Edward Porter Alexander, to define the frontier between the Republics of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.Original from the proceedings of the Alexander Commission, p. 33. 2 March 1898. Image taken from Charlie Hale, \\"Regarding the Boundary Between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\\" Google LatLong Blog , 5 Nov. 2010. According to a Costa Rican newspaper, Ed√©n Pastora justified his actions based on the border as shown by Google Maps and the need to combat drug trafficking. However, Pastora denied making any claims about relying on Google Maps to determine the border, and said to the Nicaraguan press that his understanding of the border was based on the original text of the 1858 Ca√±as-Jerez Treaty. A representative for Google Latin America stated that while ‚ÄúGoogle maps are of very high quality and Google works constantly to improve and update existing information, by no means should they be used as a reference to decide military actions between two countries.‚Äù He added, \\"In this instance Google has determined that there was an inaccuracy in the shaping of the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua and is working to update the information as quickly as possible.‚Äù The border depiction was later corrected by Google on Google Earth and in Google Maps. Both countries took different approaches on how to solve the issue. Nicaragua argued it was a border dispute that should be resolved by the International Court of Justice, while Costa Rica claimed it was a military incursion and that the Organization of American States (OAS) should resolve the issue. OAS General Secretary Jos√© Miguel Insulza met with both governments and inspected the conflict area. He then called for both countries to remove all troops and security personnel from the disputed territory as a first step toward opening a dialogue to resolve the situation peacefully and demarcate the boundary to prevent further conflicts. Costa Rica agreed to these terms, but Nicaragua refused to remove its troops. On a meeting on November 12, by a vote of 22 to 2, the OAS ambassadors approved a resolution requesting Costa Rica and Nicaragua to pull out their troops from a conflict zone along their common border and to hold talks to settle their dispute. Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega discarded the possibility of withdrawing the troops and disregarded the OAS resolution because his government considered this organization not to have jurisdiction to resolve border disputes. In the same press conference, President Ortega announced his intention to file a claim with the International Court of Justice for permission to navigate the Costa Rican Colorado River. On the political side, some commentators criticized Daniel Ortega for allegedly taking advantage of this matter to promote his re-election. Costa Rica's President Laura Chinchilla was criticized by former President √ìscar Arias for her na√Øve handling of the situation. On November 18, 2010, Costa Rica filed proceedings against Nicaragua in the International Court of Justice. The complaint alleged an incursion into, occupation of and use by Nicaragua's army of Costa Rican territory, breaches of Nicaragua's treaty obligations toward Costa Rica, and ‚Äúongoing and planned dredging and the construction of the canal (that) will seriously affect the flow of water to the Colorado River of Costa Rica, and will cause further damage to Costa Rican territory, including the wetlands and national wildlife protected areas located in the region‚Äù. Costa Rica also filed a request for provisional measures, including the withdrawal of all Nicaraguan troops from the island, the cessation of the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory, the immediate cessation of the dumping of sediment in Costa Rican territory and immediate cessation of the felling of trees, removal of vegetation and soil from Costa Rican territory, including its wetlands and forests. On the same day, OAS approved a Costa Rican request, by a vote of 22 to 1 (and 7 abstentions), to convene a Consultative Meeting of OAS Ministers of Foreign Affairs to analyze the situation between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the border zone of the San Juan River. The meeting took place on December 7, 2010. In March 2011, the International Court of Justice provisionally ruled that Costa Rica and Nicaragua both must refrain from sending or maintaining civilians, security forces or police in this disputed border area, but that Costa Rica was allowed to send civilian teams concerned with environmental matters. Dredging by Nicaragua within the San Juan River itself was allowed to continue since Nicaragua has sovereignty over the river proper. Later a dispute emerged regarding a road Costa Rica constructed at the border with Nicaragua. Nicaragua claimed that wetlands and national parks were being damaged. Nevertheless, Costa Rica argued it was necessary for protection from the \\"Sandinistas\\" and for providing electricity and other needs to people who live in a remote location, for whom the only previous transit method was by boat in the San Juan River. A note of clarification: the conflict is not taking place on Isla Calero, with 151.6 km2, but on Isla Portillos (located to the north of Calero) which is the eighth largest island in Costa Rica (16.8 km2), including the , according to executive decree No. 23248-MIRENEN of May 18, 1994. Isla Portillos has been confused by Nicaraguans and Costa Ricans, including the press and governments of both countries, with the larger Isla Calero. In spite of this, the conflict has become known as the \\"Calero Island conflict\\". 2015 Resolution On December 16, 2015, The International Court of Justice published its ruling.Case Concerning Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) , International Court of Justice, 16 December 2015 The court found that: * Costa Rica has sovereignty over the disputed territory. By excavating three ca√±os and establishing a military presence on Costa Rican territory, Nicaragua violated the territorial sovereignty of Costa Rica. By excavating two ca√±os in 2013 and establishing a military presence in the disputed territory, Nicaragua breached the provisional ruling issued by the Court on 8 March 2011. Furthermore, Nicaragua breached Costa Rica‚Äôs rights of navigation on the San Juan River pursuant to the 1858 Treaty of Limits. Nicaragua has the obligation to compensate Costa Rica for material damages caused by Nicaragua‚Äôs unlawful activities on Costa Rican territory. Said compensation will be agreed upon by the parties before December 16, 2016, or, failing agreement, shall be determined by the court. * Costa Rica violated its obligation under general international law by failing to carry out an environmental impact assessment concerning the construction of Route 1856. In June 2016, Costa Rica made an estimation of the damage to be paid of . It accepted to make a second evaluation of the damages if Nicaragua requested it. Just before the deadline, on 6 December 2016, the president of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega publicly stated that his country was willing to pay the fine. This led Costa Rica to extend the deadline for the amount agreement. On 16 January 2017, still no agreement on the amount was reached. The Costa Rica government filled a new case to the International Court of Justice concerning new military presence on its territory and asked the court to fix a final amount and a deadline concerning the 2015 resolution's compensation. On 2 February 2018, the International Court of Justice ruled that \\"The total amount of compensation awarded to Costa Rica is US$378,890.59 to be paid by Nicaragua by 2 April 2018. This amount includes the principal sum of US$358,740.55 and pre-judgment interest on the compensable costs and expenses in the amount of US$20,150.04\\". Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua); Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), I.C.J., Judgment on compensation, 2 February 2018. https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/150/150-20180202-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf Also on 2 February 2018, the ICJ rendered another decision in the border dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica regarding Isla Portillos. The court awarded the beach of Isla Portillos between the mouth of the San Juan river and Laguna Los Portillos to Costa Rica (as its intervening channel with Isla Portillos had mostly disappeared from natural forces).

Early life and military career Francis Edward, the son of The Reverend Edward Popham Spurway, was born in Winchester, Hampshire. He served in the 5th Battalion, Prince Albert's (Somerset Light Infantry) during the First World War. In July 1915 he was assigned as a temporary Captain, which he then relinquished in April 1917, receiving a promotion from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant at the same time. Later in 1917, he was given command of a Company, and was assigned an acting Captain. In 1928, he relinquished his rank of Lieutenant, and became a Chaplain in the Royal Army Chaplains' Department, having an equivalent rank to Captain (Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class). By 1933, he was serving as a Church of England minister in the parish of Bishop's Hull, Saint John. Cricket career Spurway made his first-class cricket for Somerset in 1920 making his highest score for the county during the second innings of the match against Oxford University, scoring 35 runs. He played regularly for the county in 1920 and 1921, appearing 12 times across the two seasons. He played less frequently in later years, with just seven appearances in the next three years. He did not play first-class cricket between 1925 and 1928, but returned to play four matches for Somerset in 1929. He did not play in a modern wicket-keeper / batsman role, in which the wicket-keeper is generally considered a competent batsman, and instead was often part of the tail. He scored 328 first-class runs at an average of 9.37, and took 29 catches and 14 stumpings. The Spurway family had close connections with Somerset County Cricket Club; Francis' grandfather was noted in his Wisden Cricketers' Almanack obituary as being \\"a well-known member\\" of the club, while his father, Edward Popham, uncle, Robert Popham and brother, Michael Vyvyan played first-class cricket for the county.

It is in the heart of the Surfers Paradise shopping and entertainment district. It was named in honour of the man credited as the founder of Surfers Paradise, James Cavill, known as Jim Cavill.  History  In 1887, German immigrant Johann Meyer operated a ferry across the Nerang River. From Southport, travellers would follow the Meyer's Ferry Road (now Ferry Road) to a spit of land that created a narrow point in the river () (the narrow spit is no longer in existence due to changes in the river and the creation of Chevron Island but is in the vicinity of the Gold Coast Arts Centre). From that point, Meyer's ferry would take the travellers across the river to Meyer's Ferry Road at Elston (as Surfers Paradise was then known) along which the travellers would walk to the surf beach. Businesses established along Meyer's Ferry Road at Elston which created the main street of Surfers Paradise now known as Cavill Avenue. Although the surf beaches of Elston were a popular destination, the lack of road access limited the extent of residential and commercial development. It was not until 1925, when the Jubilee Bridge was built across the Nerang River between Southport and Main Beach, that Surfers Paradise was opened up for tourism and associated development. During the same period Jim Cavill built the Surfers Paradise Hotel on the south eastern corner of Ferry Road and the South Coast Road. In 1945, in response to a letter from Mr. E Shersby to name streets after local pioneers, the Southport Town Council decided to rename the section of Ferry Road east of the Nerang River, and in front of the Surfers Paradise Hotel, in honour of Jim Cavill. It was decided to name the section of Ferry Road west of the Nerang River after Johann Meyer.  Geography  Between the Surfers Paradise Beach and Orchid Avenue, Cavill Avenue is a pedestrian mall. The Centro Surfers Paradise is a major shopping centre on pedestrian section of Cavill Avenue. The Circle on Cavill is the second shopping center on the street, located at the western end of the road, near the Gold Coast Highway. Located near the intersection of Surfers Paradise Boulevard and Cavill Avenue is the G:link Cavill Avenue Station. The G:link is the Gold Coast's new light rail system connecting Broadbeach with Helensvale via Surfers Paradise, Main Beach, Southport, Gold Coast University Hospital and Parkwood The Soul is a 243 m tall skyscraper and the second tallest skyscraper on the Gold Coast behind Q1. The building is situated on the Esplanade just to the north of Cavill Avenue. At the river end of the street are the two towers of Circle on Cavill.  Events  The mall is the centre of the annual Schoolies celebrations. According to crime statistics the mall is an alcohol fueled violence hotspot.

History  The group drew its inspiration from Brahmobandhav Upadhyaya's efforts to think out and practice an original and fresh encounter of Christianity and Hinduism. The originator of this vision was William Wallace, SJ. Thanks to his representations to the Belgian Province of the Jesuits, brilliant young Jesuits like Pierre Johanns and Georges Dandoy were sent to India to study deeply the sources of the Hindu religion. Udayan Namboodiry says: \\"The ‚ÄòBengal School,‚Äô which these came to be clubbed under, was the lasting contribution to India of Father William Wallace.\\"Namboodiry 116. Johanns and his group tried to effect a rapprochement between Hinduism and Christianity at the doctrinal level. Their organ was a monthly publication with the title The Light of the East which began in 1922 and continued for two decades. In the very first issue, the journal declared its aim: \\"What we... wish... to do is... to help India... to know and understand Jesus. ...We have no intention to put out the existing lights. Rather we shall try to show that the best thought of the East is a bud that fully expanded blossoms into Christian thought.\\"The Light of the East 1 (1922) 1‚Äì2, cited in Wilfred 38.

They are commonly used in prisons for violent inmates and hospitals for out of control patients. However, they have also been used to restrain prisoners at Guantanamo Bay detention camp during force-feeding. In the United States, the use of these chairs is controversial because a number of deaths and injuries from prolonged periods have been reported. There have been numerous cases of financial settlements, as well as personal lawsuits and at least one class action suit. In Australia, the mere use of restraint chairs has sparked opposition. History West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum in 1869 Various forms of restraint chair have been used for centuries. The modern, institutional type was introduced into the United States in the late 1990s. Description A typical, modern restraint chair consists of a sturdy frame, padded seat and padded reclining back, arm rests, a foot rest, and a set of back wheels. Straps secure the individual at the ankles, wrists, shoulders, and waist. Organizations using restraint chairs Restraint chairs are used in local jails as well as state and federal prisons. They are used by the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and also in psychiatric hospitals and juvenile detention facilities. Statistics Numbers vary within the United States and across the world. An example of the number of times the chair was used is as follows: *According to Jacksonville Sheriff's Office records, in 2015, the restraint chair was used 130 times, and then 137 times in 2014. *In Gwinnett County, during the first half of 2013, 129 inmates were held in a restraint chair. Hazards A review of deaths at United States county jails revealed that there have been nearly 40 restraint chair-related deaths since the late 1990s. Prolonged periods in a restraint chair can cause blood clots. =Incidents= There have been numerous incidents associated with the improper use of restraint chairs involving injury, torture, and death. *Cheatham County Jail officers were placed on leave after a 2017 video was released showing Jordan Norris being tased while restrained. One officer says on the video \\"I'll keep on doing that until I run out of batteries.\\" The victim has since filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court. *San Luis Obispo County was ordered to pay $5 million following the death of Andrew Holland who died after spending 46 hours in a restraining chair at the San Luis Obispo County Jail. *In July 2017, six Oklahoma officers were charged with manslaughter after Anthony Huff, a 58-year-old prisoner, died after spending over 48 hours in a restraining chair without enough food and water, and inadequate medical attention. *In March 2009, a Florida man was pepper sprayed multiple times then placed in a restraint chair in a Lee County jail. After being strapped in, a spit hood was placed over his head. He was then pepper sprayed twice more and left in the chair for a further six hours. He died in the hospital. *A video was released of two Georgia officers tasing a mentally ill man while he was restrained in a chair. 22-year-old Matthew Ajibade later died while in police custody. * The use of restraint chairs and spit hoods at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in the Northern Territory, Australia were part of the reason for the establishment of the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory.

While conducting Operation Wonsan against sea mines in Wonsan Harbor, a squadron of US Navy warships was attacked by Korean People's Army (KPA) batteries. During the operation, two US ships struck mines and sank while the remaining vessels and aircraft silenced the enemy guns. The KPA fired on American survivors in the water, wounding several men. In addition, the action prompted the United States Navy to begin the construction of hundreds of minesweepers for use in the conflict. It also gave the Americans an incentive to take a more aggressive stance by blockading Wonsan.  Action  On October 10, Lieutenant Commander Bruce Hyatt was leading a force of one destroyer, and five minesweepers on a minesweeping patrol off Wonsan. The five minesweepers were as flagship, , , and , all similarly armed and built during World War II. On the morning of October 12, the formation was steaming in a channel between the islands of Rei-To and Soku-Semu when at 11:12, the warships changed course to 258 degrees into unswept waters. The channel is wide and long. USS Pirate just after hitting a sea mine At 11:54 five contact mines were discovered in intervals of and disposed of. Six minutes later at 12:01, a helicopter from Endicott reported that there were three lines of mines off Rei-To, Soku-Semu, Koto and Roto. The specific position of the mines was not clarified but still the American vessels altered their intended course and headed for the field. Due to the threat of contact, Lieutenant Commander Hyatt ordered his ships to battle stations and the crews to disperse themselves evenly across the ships in order to minimize casualties caused by an explosion. While making the wide turn into the direction of the mines, USS Pirate struck a mine at 12:09 along frame sixty-two on the starboard side. A giant column of water was sent up and at the same time the North Korean shore batteries from Kei-To and Soku-Semu began to shoot shells at the stricken ship. As soon as the communists engaged, Endicott and the remaining minesweepers returned fire on at least three separate batteries. Pirate began listing to port at about twenty degrees and when it reached fifteen, Lieutenant Cornelius E. McMullen ordered the evacuation of his ship. Within four minutes, Pirate was hit, capsized and sank completely, taking down six enlisted men. Around sixty men went adrift, some in life rafts. At 12:04, just as the minesweeper turned over, the shore batteries resumed their shooting, this time on the sailors in the water. Because of the accurate battery fire, the American ships could not achieve a complete rescue of the survivors for over four hours. Dozens of the adrift men were wounded by shrapnel and one man was killed. Five minutes after Pirate was hit, Pledge was engaged in a gunnery duel with one of the batteries. Simultaneously, Pledge was hit by an artillery shell and struck a mine. Her commander, Lieutenant Richard O. Young, ordered his men to seal hatches and save the ship but about forty-five minutes later the crew abandoned the vessel and Pledge was underwater. Five men were killed. The KPA shore batteries were eventually silenced after several hours of fighting, enabling the American rescue of the remaining survivors. USS Redhead was heavily damaged in the battle; she received several hits from the batteries while rescuing survivors from both Pirate and Pledge. A total of twelve United States Navy sailors were killed in action and at least forty-three were wounded.  Aftermath  USS Pirates battle flag at Washington Naval Yard. Attempts were made to salvage Pirate but failed so explosives were placed in her wreck and detonated to prevent North Korean forces from recovering any classified material. Additional aircraft and boats from other nearby warships arrived at the area after the action to help in the rescue operations. USS Pirate, Pledge and Redhead each received the Presidential Unit Citation and their commanders were awarded the Silver Star for bravery. was mined off Wonsan on February 2 and became the last American vessel to be destroyed during operations in that area. Sometime in 1952, Lieutenant McMullen received an anonymous package containing Pirates battle flag and on May 28, 1985, it was donated to the Naval Historical Center and is on display at the Korean War exhibit.

It is located at 233 Shelburne Center Road, in an architecturally distinctive 1898 Gothic Revival stone structure built out of local riverstone. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Architecture and history The Shelburne Free Library stands in the small village of Shelburne Center, just south of Massachusetts Route 2 on the east side of Shelburne Center Road. It is a roughly square 1-1/2 story gable-roofed stone structure, built of local stone laid in an uncourse mortared manner. Its main facade is symmetrical, with the main entrance set in a segmented-arch recess whose side and end walls are paneled. Flanking this recess on either side are narrow rectangular windows. The gable rises to a level slightly above that of the main roof, and has small buttresses at the ends. The side walls each have three windows. A single-story addition, built out of similar materials, projects southward from the rear corner. The library was founded in 1854 by William and Walter Wells, who established a lending library in one of their homes, and charged an annual fee of $3 for its use. The Wellses amassed a collection of 2,000 books that rivaled that of the Arms Library, a free library established in Shelburne Falls a few years earlier. The library was formally organized in 1895, and the present building's main block was built in 1898. The stones used in its construction were reportedly gathered from all over the rural community and brought to the site, stockpiled over years until a sufficient quantity were accumulated. The addition, built in 1952-53, was also built out of local stone, carefully chosen and laid to match the original.

Written to accompany a prizewinning text by Aage Berntsen, it was first performed in Odense's Kv√¶ghal (Cattle Hall) on 8 July 1922 where it was conducted by Georg H√∏eberg. Background Aage Berntsen, a medical doctor and a writer, was the winner of a competition arranged around 1917 by the Dansk Korforening (Danish Choral Society) for a text on Danish history or landscape which would subsequently be set to music by Carl Nielsen. Several years went by before the composer could find the time or inclination to work on the piece, especially as he was in the middle of composing his Fifth Symphony. Indeed, on 19 August 1921, he wrote: \\"For some time I have not felt very comfortable because I could not get started on the choral work which I must have done by 1 September, and every day I considered throwing it away and informing the board of all these combined societies that I had to beg off... But then one day I found the tone and the style, which will be a light mixture of lyricism and humour, and now it is well in hand and will soon be finished.Niels Krabbe, \\"Springtime on Funen\\", Cantatas 1, Carl Nielsen Edition , Danish Royal Library. Retrieved 12 November 2010. Only with the help of his pupil Nancy Dalberg, who had helped with fair-copying the large score for Aladdin was he able to meet his deadline. On 3 September 1921, he wrote to his wife: \\"My new choral piece has turned out to be a really big piece of work (42 pages in the piano arrangement) and has now actually been delivered on time. But I have also worked a lot and with a certain lightness. The poet has called it Springtime on Funen but I also give it a subtitle, Lyrical Humoresque, which suggests that the style is light and lively... Now I will continue with my interrupted symphony.\\" Reception The first performance of Fynsk Foraar was at the opening concert of Third National Choral Festival which took place on 8 July 1922 in the huge Odense Kv√¶ghal (Cattle Hall), specially renamed Markedshallen (Market Hall) for the occasion. The circumstances were not ideal. While Nielsen had envisaged the work for a fairly small orchestra and choir, there were 80 in the orchestra and several hundred in the choirs from Funen and Copenhagen. The hall itself could accommodate up to 10,000 people. The day after the concert, Politiken commented: \\"Enthusiastic applause rewarded the choral work. The composer and poet were called for in vain. Neither was present.\\" Nielsen had in fact explained a few days earlier that he was not feeling up to travelling to Odense. Most reviewers agreed that the work had not been performed in the right venue. N.O. Raasted, writing for a local newspaper Fyns Tidende was frank: \\"So light and graceful, so witty and veiled is the language spoken here that several of the work's beautiful passages could only be lost in a performance under such circumstances! We look forward to hearing it all again in the not too distant future if the work can be presented in circumstances that are more favourable to its appreciation.\\" Another local newspaper Fyens Stiftstidende commented on the work's regional tone: \\"There was the greatest interest in the next item in the concert, Aage Berntsen‚Äôs and Carl Nielsen‚Äôs never-before-performed work for soloists, choir and orchestra, Springtime on Funen. Rarely have a poet and composer been so fortunate in finding the fullest expression of the distinctive atmosphere and emotional life of a Danish region. The Funen islanders totally lack the capacity to take themselves too seriously. As true sons of the Funen soil, Berntsen and Carl Nielsen have therefore made Springtime on Funen a humoresque; but no less distinctively, the humoresque bears the stamp of the lyrical, for among the Danes the people of Funen remain those who abandon themselves most easily to the play of the emotions.\\" In the meantime, Nielsen was planning his own performance of the work at the Music Society (Musikforeningen) in Copenhagen. In a letter dated 29 June 1922 to the composer Rudolf Simonsen, he describes how he would like it performed under his own baton: \\"III myself: Springtime on Funen small orchestra: light and gay and graceful as my humble talents can manage.\\" The work was indeed presented by the Music Society at the first concert of the season on 21 November 1922. Axel Kj√¶rulf, writing in Politiken, was full of praise for the work: \\"It is enchantingly formed, so light and bright, so full and fertile, so simple and inward. In each strophe one recognizes Carl Nielsen‚Äôs Danish tone, but here sweeter and truer than before. He is intimate with everything ‚Äî and the rest of us get as close as possible to this often so inaccessible man ‚Äî and grow fond of him.\\" Music Fynsk Foraar is often considered Nielsen's most popular choral work, especially in Denmark. Nielsen gave it the subtitle \\"lyric humoresque\\", aptly describing its simple, folk-like idiom and its compact form. Scored for a four-part chorus, soprano, tenor, and baritone soloists, a children's chorus and a small chamber orchestra, the 18-minute cantata consists of several independent sections tied together with orchestral transitions. The choral writing is largely diatonic and homophonic. The solo melodies contain frequent alternations between major and minor tonalities. This work is often cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions; this seems borne out as the chorus and soloists extol a countryside replete with grass, water lilies, and gnarled apple trees blooming.Brian Wise, \\"Fynsk foraar (Springtime on Funen), for soloists, chorus & orchestra, FS 96 (Op. 42)\\", Answers.com.

Early life In 1930 he participated in the civil disobedience movement and later, in 1932, was convicted for revolutionary activities. At the age of 18, in 1933, he was condemned to the Andaman Islands for six years. Inside the jail he formed the Communist Consolidation with other communist prisoners. He joined the communist movement in 1938.Sansad Bangla Charitbhidhan, p. 622, Elections He won the elections to the state assembly from Kalna (Vidhan Sabha constituency) in 1957, 1962, 1967, 1969 and 1971. He was Minister for Land and Land Revenue in the United Front ministries in 1967 and 1969. Land reforms After joining the communist movement he became a prominent leader of the Kisan movement first in Burdwan district and later in West Bengal. He was a Council member of Communist Party of India. He was one of the 32 founder-members of Communist Party of India (Marxist) when it was formed from Communist Party of India in 1964. He was the General Secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha and a member of the Central Committee of the CPI(M). Hare Krishna Konar played a leading role in getting surplus land held by big land owners in excess of land ceiling laws and kept ‚Äòbenami‚Äô (or false names) vested with the state. The quantum of land thus vested was around one million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of good agricultural land. Subsequently, under the leadership of Benoy Choudhury, this land was distributed amongst 2.4 million landless and poor farmers. It has been argued that this land reform along with Operation Barga formed the base for the Left Front victory in subsequent elections. Barga Operation was his notable contribution. To begin with, group meetings between Officials and Bargadars were organized during \\"settlement camps\\" (also called \\"Reorientation camps\\"), where the bargadars could discuss their grievances. The first such camp was held at Halusai in Polba taluk in Hooghly district from 18 to 20 May 1978. In noted camp two Adibashi Borgaders objected procedure adopted by the official for Barga Operation. They suggested to start it organising people in the field instead of sitting in the houses of rural rich people or the places dominated by them. Having that report Hare Krishna Konar immediately reorganised action plan and successful Barga Operation was done.  Death  He died in July 1974 due to cancer at the age of 59. His brother Benoy Krishna Konar was another CPI(M) leader.

It starts at the Altona station and runs through Othmarschen to Blankenese station. This section of line was opened in 1867. 16 years later the line was extended to Wedel. It is now used by lines S1 and S11 of the Hamburg S-Bahn and was part of the first electrified suburban railway in Germany. Route Former station building in Klein Flottbek The line begins at Altona station, where there is a four-track underground S-Bahn station, which has an attached reversing facility. The City S-Bahn line runs up a steep ramp (with a maximum gradient of 4.0%) to the surface and shortly later the Altona‚ÄìBlankenese line branches off the line to Pinneberg and turns west. It passes through the stations of Bahrenfeld, Othmarschen, Klein Flottbek and Hochkamp and then runs into the three-track terminal station of Blankenese. Like the line from Hamburg, the Blankenese- Wedel extension is connected to the eastern end of the station, so trains have to reverse out of the station to continue their journey. The line then runs to the stations of Iserbrook, S√ºlldorf, Rissen and finally, the terminus at Wedel. Unlike the section east of Blankenese, the extension to Wedel is mostly single track. History  Multiple unit ElT1624, which was used on the Blankenese-Altona‚ÄìHauptbahnhof-Barmbek-Olsdorf line during the period of operation with catenary between 1927 and 1955 The line was opened on 19 May 1867 between Altona and Blankenese, although the only intermediate stations opened at that time were at Klein Flottbek and Bahrenfeld. The Othmarschen station was opened on 1 August 1882 with the development of the villa estate () of Othmarschen. Hochkamp station was built later. On 1 December 1883, the extension was opened from Blankenese to Wedel. Extension of the line onwards from Blankenese station would have required a tunnel. Instead the station was built as a terminal station. Between 1911 and 1914 the Blankenese‚ÄìMarienh√∂he Trackless Railway (Gleislose Bahn Blankenese‚ÄìMarienh√∂he), an early trolleybus operation, ran from Blankenese station. The Altona‚ÄìBlankenese section, which had been duplicated by 1900, became part of the network of the Hamburg-Altona Urban and Suburban Railway (Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn) on its establishment in 1906. In 1907 the line was electrified with overhead wires at 6.3 kV 25 Hz alternating current. It was the first electrified suburban railway in Germany. In 1934, the Urban and Suburban Railway was renamed the S-Bahn and converted to direct current operations, using side-contact third rail and a voltage of 1.2 kV. Because of Second World War, the conversion took place in two stage in 1940 and 1955. During this period, electrification was extended on the Blankenese line, initially, on 14 May 1950, from Blankenese to S√ºlldorf, with steam trains continuing to Wedel. A few months later, on 31 October 1950, Iserbrook station opened. On 20 May 1954, electrification was extended to Wedel. The entire length of the line is now served by S-Bahn line S1. In addition S11 services operate from Altona to Blankenese during the peak hour. S1 trains are mainly operated with class 474 Electric multiple units, S11 are operated with class 472 EMUs. =Freight = Until 1997 a little freight was carried on the line. The freight tracks at Klein Flottbek and Blankenese stations are now completely run down. There used to be a siding from near Bahrenfeld station to a gas works. Sidings also connected to the Ottensen industrial railway and the Unilever margarine factory, using the Rollbock system. The √ñlweiche siding used to connect to the Wedel Power Station.

Early life He passed matriculation from Burdwan Municipal High School and Intermediate in Science. from Serampore College, under the University of Calcutta. As a student at the age of thirteen, Chowdhury joined the Indian freedom movement, joining the Indian National Congress party in 1924 along with his friend Saroj Mukherjee. He joined the Jugantar group in 1928 and was in jail before he could sit for his B.A. examination. While studying in Serampore College, he and Saroj Mukherjee became acquainted with Dr. Bhupendranath Datta and Communist leaders Muzaffar Ahmed and Abdul Halim. Active in politics In 1930 he was sent to jail for his activities with Anushilan Samiti. Again in 1938 he was jailed for his involvement in Birbhum conspiracy case. He joined the Communist Party in 1938. Elections He filed his nomination for election from Burdwan constituency in 1951 while still in jail. Benoy Choudhury representing undivided CPI secured 11,439 votes, Uday Chand Mahtab, the erstwhile Maharaja of Burdwan, representing Congress secured 9,477 votes. Thereafter, he went on to win the Burdwan seat in 1957, and then the Burdwan South seat in 1969 and 1971. He won from the Bardhaman North seat in 1987 and 1991. He was minister of different departments. Land reforms Benoy Choudhury played a leading role in land reforms in West Bengal. Land reforms can be divided into two phases. In the first phase in 1967‚Äì1970, Hare Krishna Konar recovered around a million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of land through existing legal means. In the second phase of land reforms in 1978‚Äì1982, Benoy Choudhury accomplished two major tasks. The first task was carried out under Operation Barga when around 1.7 million sharecroppers were formally recorded, assuring them of permanency of land holding and a fair share of the crop. The second task was the distribution of about a million acres (4,000 km¬≤) of land earlier vested amongst 2.4 million poor and landless farm labor. Thus about 4 million people were directly benefited, laying the foundation for victory of the Left Front in subsequent years. Later life After retirement from active politics, he lived in a small rented flat in Bidhannagar, trying to make a living on the spouse's pension he received from his dead wife's account. She had been the headmistress of a school. Benoy Choudhury was well known for his frank talking. On 17 December 1995, when he was the second man in the West Bengal government he remarked, \\"This is a government of contractors, by contractors and for contractors\\". After his death, one obituary note read, \\"A poor man he had nothing to bequeath so he gave his eyes to the eye bank and his body to Calcutta Medical College for research\\".

First published in 1991 by the English board game company Oxford Games Ltd., Ex Libris was devised and compiled by Leslie Scott (the creator of Jenga) and designed by Sara Finch.Oxford Games Ltd: About Us The game involves having to write fake, but plausible, opening (or closing) sentences of genuine books in an attempt to fool fellow players into believing your words are the authentic first (or last) lines of a given book.  Rules of play  The game comprises one hundred cards, each of which provides (on the one side) the title, author, and plot summary of a published book or short story; and on the flip side, the genuine first and last sentences of that book. At the start of each round, a different player takes on the role of reader and reads aloud the title, author and plot summary. The other players are then required to write plausible first or last sentences for the book, handing their efforts over to the reader, who has meanwhile copied the correct line onto a similar piece of paper, which he/she shuffles amongst the 'fake' scripts. The reader then reads aloud all the sentences, taking care to disguise the genuine, and each player then votes for which line he or she considers the genuine first or last sentence. A player receives one point for each vote given his or her fake line. A player receives one point if he/she votes for the book's authentic first or last line. The reader receives one point if no one identifies the genuine line.

She taught at the University of Louisiana, Harvard University, Brandeis University, and Rutgers University. She was Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Byzantine Studies at Harvard from 1981 until her death. From 2000 to 2002, she was also a member of the Hellenic Parliament for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK): she served as Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs for six months in 2000. Angeliki Laiou (1941-2008) Early life and education Laiou was born in Athens on 6 April 1941 to a Pontic family, refugees from the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. She studied at the Athens College and continued her studies in the Philosophy School of the University of Athens (1958‚Äì59), where she studied under the Greek Byzantinist Dionysios Zakythinos, who awakened her interest in the Byzantine Empire. She moved to Brandeis University from where she graduated with her BA in 1961, and completed a post-graduate course and received her PhD from Harvard in 1966, under the supervision of Robert Lee Wolff, one of the leading historians of the Crusades. Her doctoral thesis became the basis for her first book, published in 1972 as Constantinople and the Latins: The Foreign Policy of Andronicus II, 1282‚Äì1328. Academic career In 1962, she went to lecture at the University of Louisiana, before returning to Harvard, where she stayed from 1966 to 1972, first as instructor and then as assistant professor. She then moved to Brandeis, where she remained until 1981, becoming distinguished professor. During this period, she also taught at Rutgers College of Rutgers University. In 1981, she returned to Harvard to occupy the prestigious Dumbarton Oaks Professorship of Byzantine Studies, a post she held until her death. In 1985‚Äì88, she served as the head of Harvard's History Department and from 1989 until 1998 she headed the distinguished Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, DC ‚Äî the first woman to do so. Laiou in 1992With her Laiou pioneered the study of Byzantine and wider medieval society, and especially the role of women. Her article on The role of women in Byzantine society, published in the Jahrbuch der √∂sterreichischen Byzantinistik in 1981, \\"opened a new field for scholars of Byzantium\\". Her works on Peasant Society in the Late Byzantine Empire (1977) and Mariage, Amour et Parent√© √† Byzance Aux XIe-XIIIe Si√®cles (1992) were among the first studies in their field. During her last years, she presided over the compilation of the three-volume Economic History of Byzantium (2002), a definitive work in this until then rather neglected field, followed up a few years later by The Byzantine Economy (2007), her last book. In her native Greece, she was honoured by being inducted into the Academy of Athens in 1998, only the second woman after the writer Galateia Saranti, and by being decorated with the Commander class of the Order of Honour. Laiou was also a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, a foreign member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, a member of the Medieval Academy of America and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and an honorary professor at Nankai University. Political career In the April 2000 elections, she was elected as a member of the Hellenic Parliament on the list of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. In May 2000, she was also named as Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs charged with relations with the Greek diaspora. Disappointed with the realities of the job, she resigned the post six months later to resume her academic activities, and resigned her Parliament seat as well in 2002. Personal life She was married to Stavros Thomadakis, a former chairman of the Greek Capital Market Commission, whom she later divorced. She is survived by a son, Vassilis Thomadakis.

The term is still used today, but its meaning has changed over the years, and is used inconsistently in present- day literature. Although RES is commonly associated exclusively with macrophages, recent research has revealed that the cells that accumulate intravenously administrated vital stain belong to a highly specialised group of cells called scavenger endothelial cells (SECs), that are not macrophages. History In the 1920s, the founder of the term RES, Ludwig Aschoff, reviewed the field of vital staining, and concluded that the cells lining the hepatic sinusoids are by far the most numerous and important cells accumulating intravenously administered vital stains in mammals and other vertebrates. Cells lining the lymph sinuses, and the capillaries of the adrenals, pituitary and bone marrow also accumulated vital stains, yet to a lower extent. Based on these observations Aschoff in his review concluded that these were the organs housing the cells of the RES, in the narrow sense of the term. At the time when the notion of RES was launched, the understanding of concepts like endothelium, macrophages and phagocytosis were immature compared to what we know today, and during the centennium that followed there has been a considerable change in the way we understand these terms today.  The RES ‚Äì MPS confusion  During the years that followed after Aschoff had launched the concept of RES, research on macrophages and their feature as professional phagocytes steadily increased, and in 1960 the concept of the mononuclear phagocyte system was proposed to denote all cells identified as macrophages. The cells of MPS, by way of their common functional signature as professional phagocytes, clear particulate matter such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and dying cells from the circulation. Since blood clearance is also a characteristic function of cells of RES, it was suggested in the late 1960s that RES is identical to MPS, and it was proposed that the term RES be replaced with MPS. During the 1980s and 1990s some laboratories noted that specialized endothelial cells (called scavenger endothelial cells), but not macrophages, were responsible for the avid clearance of macromolecules and nanoparticles from the blood circulation. This triggered a re-evaluation of the well-established notion that . In 1998 experiments were carried out to repeat the studies of Aschoff, following exactly the original methods description, and using modern ways of identifying the cells that were responsible for clearance of intravascularly injected colloidal lithium carmine, the most commonly used vital stain. The studies showed that the cell system that Aschoff described as RES in the liver were liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), but not liver macrophages (Kupffer cells). In most present-day text books and articles the term RES is used synonymously with MPS. This is especially unfortunate when discussing e.g. blood clearance of nano formulations. Refraining from including the highly active LSEC when discussing blood clearance may lead to failure to understand the mechanisms of clearance of several substances from the circulation.

It was established in 2010 and is published by Frontiers Media, who were controversially included in Jeffrey Beall's list of \\"potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers\\". The editor-in-chief is Axel Cleeremans (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles). Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in Current Contents/Social & Behavioral Sciences, EBSCO databases, PsycINFO, Scopus,. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 2.067. Since 2016, the journal has a score of 2 in the Norwegian Scientific Index, which \\"covers the most prestigious and rigorous channels, which publish 20 per cent of the publications\\". Controversies In February 2013, Frontiers published a study by Stephan Lewandowsky and co- authors which analysed conspiracy theory explanations given in blog responses to an earlier paper about conspiracy theories and support for free-market economics as indicators of a climate change denial stance. In March 2014, Frontiers retracted the study, and made a statement that they had received \\"a small number of complaints\\". Their detailed investigation \\"did not identify any issues with the academic and ethical aspects of the study. It did, however, determine that the legal context is insufficiently clear and therefore Frontiers wishes to retract the published article.\\" There were public concerns about the \\"chilling effect\\" of the decision on research. One of the reviewers of the paper said that the withdrawal was unwarranted, and she would no longer carry out reviews for the journal. On 4 April 2014 Costanza Zucca, editorial director of the journal, and Fred Fenter, executive editor, issued a statement saying that Frontiers did not cave in to threats, and it in fact received no threats. The statement gave the main reason for retraction as insufficient protection for the rights of the studied subjects. There was public discussion about apparent contradictions between the statements issued by the journal. And the authors of the paper disputed points raised in the second statement. Frontiers Media was included in Jeffrey Beall's list of \\"potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers\\" before Beall took the decision to shut down his website, though both COPE and OASPA have stated that they have no concerns with Frontiers' membership of their organizations.

Vacancy  The vacancy was caused when the borough's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) James Gascoyne-Cecil, known by his courtesy title as Viscount Cranborne, succeeded to the peerage on 22 August 1903. He had been MP for Darwen from 1885 to 1892, and then for Rochester since winning the seat at a by-election in 1893. Electoral history Cranborne had been returned unopposed at the 1900 general election, so the borough had not seen a contested parliamentary election since 1895.  Candidates  Sir Harry Johnston The two major parties chose their candidates on 2 September. The Unionists (the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies) chose Charles Tuff, the owner of a large firm of contractors. He had been mayor of Rochester from 1900 to 1902. The Liberal Party selected as its candidate Sir Harry Johnston, an African explorer and colonial administrator. The writ for the by- election was received on 15 September by the mayor, who fixed 18 September as the closing day for nominations, and Wednesday 23 September as polling day. No independent or minor party candidates were nominated, so the election was a two-way contest between Tuff and Johnston.  Campaign  The Liberals were disappointed that the election was called so soon after the vacancy occurred, because they believed that a longer campaign would help their prospects. Both candidates had issued the election address by 9 September, along with a lot of supporting literature. The two parties hoped to canvass all the borough's electors, but acknowledged that the shortness of the campaign made this target unlikely. The Unionists were reported by The Times newspaper to have a \\"near- perfect\\" organisation in Rochester. The main issue in the campaign was tariff reform, over which the Liberal Unionist minister Joseph Chamberlain had recently resigned from the cabinet to campaign for Imperial Preference. The Liberals also focused on the conduct of the Second Boer War. In the first full week of the campaign, the Unionists decided not to hold a large public meeting, but rather to hold five smaller meetings in different parts of the borough. Speakers were to include Sir William Hart Dyke MP and Horatio Davies MP. The Liberals held the biggest meeting, at the Corn Exchange, but otherwise the meetings organised by the Unionists were better attended. A major theme in the campaign was the question of free trade; Edmund Robertson MP spoke at a Liberal meeting to say that the issue was simply one of taxing food: would the tariffs on food be renewed? Johnston sent a \\"personal note\\" to Unionist supporters condemning the Unionist government's handling of the Boer War, and accusing them of deliberately throwing away the lives of British soldiers. He called on any Unionists who saw themselves as patriots to abstain rather than elect a supporter of such a government. Extensive canvassing took place on Saturday 19 September, after which both parties reported that the outcome would likely depend on the Labour vote. Both the Tariff Reform League and the Free Trade Association distributed large numbers of leaflets and cartoons, and the Licensed Victuallers Association was actively organising in support of the Unionists. The costs incurred by the two candidates were reported in The Times in November 1903: Tuff's campaign had spent ¬£559 18s 5d, and Johnston's campaign had spent ¬£636 4s. 4d.

He was known for his exceptional technique and fluid style on all reed instruments; Campise is most recognized for his association with the Stan Kenton Orchestra in the mid-1970s.  Musical education, style, and first work in Houston  Campise was born and raised in Houston, Texas and early on had studied with Hal Tennyson at the age of 13 on alto sax and clarinet. He also studied with the famed Woody Herman jazz sideman Jerry Coker learning improvisation when he was 18, Campise also studied briefly with Lee Konitz. He studied flute and oboe extensively with Byron and Barbara Hester in the 1960s; most notably he studied flute with Julius Baker in New York during the late 1960s in hopes of becoming a classical flutist. His formal musical education came in his college years while attending Sam Houston State University, the University of Houston, Houston Baptist College, and Monterey Peninsula College during the late 1960s and early 1970s.Feather, Leonard.

Emmis Communications. pp. 88 but eventually settled to Austin, Texas in 1984. The influences Campise most closely attributed his own style to are jazz artists Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Lennie Tristano, and Eric Dolphy. His first notable work as a saxophonist was in Houston working with Don Cannon (1962‚Äì65), Paul Schmitt (1967‚Äì71), the Gulf Coast Jazz Giants (1970‚Äì73) and working with the Houston Musical Theatre as a woodwind doubler for three seasons.

Kenton himself is also quoted, \\"...Campise has such tremendous technique he can't help but use it. He would take a lot of wild chances and scare guys to death, the things he would get going on that horn.\\" Kenton bandmate Dick Shearer probably best sums up Tony Campise's prowess as a world-class musician and jazz soloist, \\"Campise probably knew more about saxophone than anyone I've ever heard in my life.

There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights. There are three principal views: # The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar). # The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something. # The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This view has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.  Methodology  In the late 1800s and most of the 1900s, language teaching was usually conceived in terms of method. In seeking to improve teaching practices, teachers and researchers would typically try to find out which method was the most effective. However, method is an ambiguous concept in language teaching, and has been used in many different ways. According to Bell, this variety in use \\"offers a challenge for anyone wishing to enter into the analysis or deconstruction of methods\\"., cited in  Approach, method and technique  In 1963, University of Michigan Linguistics Professor Edward Mason Anthony Jr. formulated a framework to describe various language teaching methods, which consisted of three levels: approach, method, and technique. According to Anthony, \\"The arrangement is hierarchical. The organizational key is that techniques carry out a method which is consistent with an approach.\\", cited in . His concept of approach was of a set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning which would be consistent over time; \\"an approach is axiomatic\\". His method was more procedural; \\"an overall plan for the orderly presentation of language material, no part of which contradicts, and all of which is based upon, the selected approach.\\" Finally, his concept of technique referred to the actual implementation in the language classroom; \\"a particular trick, stratagem, or contrivance used to accomplish an immediate objective.\\" He saw techniques as being consistent with a given method and by extension, with a given approach. A method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students and the roles of teachers. A technique is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less-directly, with the approach. Anthony's framework was welcomed by the language teaching community when it was introduced, and it was seen as a useful way of classifying different teaching practices. However, it did not clearly define the difference between approach, method, and technique, and Kumaravadivelu reports that due to this ambiguity there was \\"widespread dissatisfaction\\" with it. Anthony himself recognized the limitations of his framework, and was open to the idea of improvements being made to it.  Approach, design and procedure  Richards and Rogers' 1982 approach expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, instead of approach, method and technique, they chose the terms approach, design, and procedure. Their concept of approach was similar to Anthony's, but their design and procedure were of broader scope than Anthony's method and technique. Their design referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, types of activities to be used in the classroom, and student and teacher roles; procedure referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom. These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework, and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different \\"methods\\". This evaluation process was a key way that their formulation differed from Anthony's, as Anthony's framework was intended as purely descriptive. Despite Richards and Rogers' efforts to clearly define approach, design, and procedure, their framework has been criticized by Kumaravadivelu for having \\"an element of artificiality in its conception and an element of subjectivity in its operation\\". Kumaravadivelu also points to similar objections raised by Pennyworth and by the Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning. Brown also questions the suitability of Richards and Rogers' term design; he points out that in English teaching design is usually used to refer specifically to curriculum design, rather than the broad definition Richards and Rogers used., cited in . Most current teacher training manuals favor the terms approach, method, and technique.  Structural methods  = Grammar‚Äìtranslation method = The grammar translation method instructs students in grammar, and provides vocabulary with direct translations to memorize. It was the predominant method in Europe in the 19th century. Most instructors now acknowledge that this method is ineffective by itself. It is now most commonly used in the traditional instruction of the classical languages, however it remains the most commonly practiced method of English teaching in Japan. At school, the teaching of grammar consists of a process of training in the rules of a language which must make it possible for all the students to correctly express their opinion, to understand the remarks which are addressed to them and to analyze the texts which they read. The objective is that by the time they leave college, the pupil controls the tools of the language which are the vocabulary, grammar and the orthography, to be able to read, understand and write texts in various contexts. The teaching of grammar examines texts, and develops awareness that language constitutes a system which can be analyzed. This knowledge is acquired gradually, by traversing the facts of language and the syntactic mechanisms, going from simplest to the most complex. The exercises according to the program of the course must untiringly be practiced to allow the assimilation of the rules stated in the course. That supposes that the teacher corrects the exercises. The pupil can follow his progress in practicing the language by comparing his results. Thus can he adapt the grammatical rules and control little by little the internal logic of the syntactic system. The grammatical analysis of sentences constitutes the objective of the teaching of grammar at the school. Its practice makes it possible to recognize a text as a coherent whole and conditions the training of a foreign language. Grammatical terminology serves this objective. Grammar makes it possible for each pupil to understand how his mother tongue functions, in order to give him the capacity to communicate his thought. = Audio-lingual method = The audio-lingual method was developed in the United States around World War II when governments realized that they needed more people who could conduct conversations fluently in a variety of languages, work as interpreters, code-room assistants, and translators. However, since foreign language instruction in that country was heavily focused on reading instruction, no textbooks, other materials or courses existed at the time, so new methods and materials had to be devised. For example, the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program created intensive programs based on the techniques Leonard Bloomfield and other linguists devised for Native American languages, where students interacted intensively with native speakers and a linguist in guided conversations designed to decode its basic grammar and learn the vocabulary. This \\"informant method\\" had great success with its small class sizes and motivated learners. The U.S. Army Specialized Training Program only lasted a few years, but it gained a lot of attention from the popular press and the academic community. Charles C. Fries set up the first English Language Institute at the University of Michigan, to train English as a second or foreign language teachers. Similar programs were created later at Georgetown University, University of Texas among others based on the methods and techniques used by the military. The developing method had much in common with the British oral approach although the two developed independently. The main difference was the developing audio-lingual methods allegiance to structural linguistics, focusing on grammar and contrastive analysis to find differences between the student's native language and the target language in order to prepare specific materials to address potential problems. These materials strongly emphasized drill as a way to avoid or eliminate these problems. This first version of the method was originally called the oral method, the aural-oral method or the structural approach. The audio-lingual method truly began to take shape near the end of the 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the space race. Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from behaviorist psychology to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the target language at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits. The typical structure of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM‚Äîand there was even a text book entitled ALM [1963]) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was \\"pattern practice,\\" which were drills expecting \\"automatic\\" responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as \\"mimicry- memorization.\\" 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise. Due to weaknesses in performance,Universiteit Antwerpen James L. Barker lecture on November 8, 2001 at Brigham Young University, given by Wilfried Decoo. and more importantly because of Noam Chomsky's theoretical attack on language learning as a set of habits, audio-lingual methods are rarely the primary method of instruction today. However, elements of the method still survive in many textbooks.  Functional methods  = The oral approach and situational language teaching = The oral approach was developed from the 1930s to the 1960s by British applied linguists such as Harold Palmer and A.S. Hornsby. They were familiar with the direct method as well as the work of 19th-century applied linguists such as Otto Jespersen and Daniel Jones but attempted to formally develop a more scientifically founded approach to teaching English than was evidenced by the direct method. A number of large- scale investigations about language learning and the increased emphasis on reading skills in the 1920s led to the notion of \\"vocabulary control\\". It was discovered that languages have a core basic vocabulary of about 2,000 words that occur frequently in written texts, and it was assumed that mastery of these would greatly aid reading comprehension. Parallel to this was the notion of \\"grammar control\\", emphasizing the sentence patterns most-commonly found in spoken conversation. Such patterns were incorporated into dictionaries and handbooks for students. The principal difference between the oral approach and the direct method was that methods devised under this approach would have theoretical principles guiding the selection of content, gradation of difficulty of exercises and the presentation of such material and exercises. The main proposed benefit was that such theoretically based organization of content would result in a less-confusing sequence of learning events with better contextualization of the vocabulary and grammatical patterns presented. Last but not least, all language points were to be presented in \\"situations\\". Emphasis on this point led to the approach's second name. Proponents claim that this approach leads to students' acquiring good habits to be repeated in their corresponding situations. These teaching methods stress PPP: presentation (introduction of new material in context), practice (a controlled practice phase) and production (activities designed for less-controlled practice). Although this approach is all but unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on language teaching, being the basis of many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks as late as the 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts. Many of the structural elements of this approach were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative language teaching. However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar. = Directed practice = Directed practice has students repeat phrases. This method is used by U.S. diplomatic courses. It can quickly provide a phrasebook-type knowledge of the language. Within these limits, the student's usage is accurate and precise. However the student's choice of what to say is not flexible.  Interactive methods  High School Spanish taught as a second language to a class of native English speakers at an American private school in Massachusetts. = Direct method = The direct method, sometimes also called natural method, is a method that refrains from using the learners' native language and just uses the target language. It was established in Germany and France around 1900 and is best represented by the methods devised by Berlitz and de Sauz√©, although neither claims originality and it has been re-invented under other names. The direct method operates on the idea that second language learning must be an imitation of first language learning, as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of oral skills at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary. According to this method, printed language and text must be kept away from second language learners for as long as possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words until he has good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after the printed word has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency. The method relies on a step-by-step progression based on question-and-answer sessions which begin with naming common objects such as doors, pencils, floors, etc. It provides a motivating start as the learner begins using a foreign language almost immediately. Lessons progress to verb forms and other grammatical structures with the goal of learning about thirty new words per lesson. = The series method = In the 19th century, Fran√ßois Gouin went to Hamburg to learn German. Based on his experience as a Latin teacher, he thought the best way to do this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, when he went to the academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck. When he returned home, he found that his three-year-old nephew had learned to speak French. He noticed the boy was very curious and upon his first visit to a mill, he wanted to see everything and be told the name of everything. After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but a way of thinking and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts. The series method is a variety of the direct method in that experiences are directly connected to the target language. Gouin felt that such direct \\"translation\\" of experience into words, makes for a \\"living language\\". (p59) Gouin also noticed that children organize concepts in succession of time, relating a sequence of concepts in the same order. Gouin suggested that students learn a language more quickly and retain it better if it is presented through a chronological sequence of events. Students learn sentences based on an action such as leaving a house in the order in which such would be performed. Gouin found that if the series of sentences are shuffled, their memorization becomes nearly impossible. For this, Gouin preceded psycholinguistic theory of the 20th century. He found that people will memorize events in a logical sequence, even if they are not presented in that order. He also discovered a second insight into memory called \\"incubation\\". Linguistic concepts take time to settle in the memory. The learner must use the new concepts frequently after presentation, either by thinking or by speaking, in order to master them. His last crucial observation was that language was learned in sentences with the verb as the most crucial component. Gouin would write a series in two columns: one with the complete sentences and the other with only the verb. With only the verb elements visible, he would have students recite the sequence of actions in full sentences of no more than twenty-five sentences. Another exercise involved having the teacher solicit a sequence of sentences by basically ask him/her what s/he would do next. While Gouin believed that language was rule-governed, he did not believe it should be explicitly taught. His course was organized on elements of human society and the natural world. He estimated that a language could be learned with 800 to 900 hours of instruction over a series of 4000 exercises and no homework. The idea was that each of the exercises would force the student to think about the vocabulary in terms of its relationship with the natural world. While there is evidence that the method can work extremely well, it has some serious flaws. One of which is the teaching of subjective language, where the students must make judgments about what is experienced in the world (e.g. \\"bad\\" and \\"good\\") as such do not relate easily to one single common experience. However, the real weakness is that the method is entirely based on one experience of a three-year-old. Gouin did not observe the child's earlier language development such as naming (where only nouns are learned) or the role that stories have in human language development. What distinguishes the series method from the direct method is that vocabulary must be learned by translation from the native language, at least in the beginning. = Communicative language teaching = Communicative language teaching (CLT), also known as the Communicative Approach, emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticismsvan Hattum, Ton (2006), The Communicative Approach Rethought it continues to be popular, particularly in Europe, where constructivist views on language learning and education in general dominate academic discourse. Although the 'Communicative Language Teaching' is not so much a method on its own as it is an approach. In recent years, task-based language learning (TBLL), also known as task-based language teaching (TBLT) or task-based instruction (TBI), has grown steadily in popularity. TBLL is a further refinement of the CLT approach, emphasizing the successful completion of tasks as both the organizing feature and the basis for assessment of language instruction. Dogme language teaching shares a philosophy with TBL, although differs in approach.Meddings, L and Thornbury, S (2009) Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching. Peaslake: Delta. Dogme is a communicative approach, and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. = Language immersion = Language immersion in school contexts delivers academic content through the medium of a foreign language, providing support for L2 learning and first language maintenance. There are three main types of immersion education programs in the United States: foreign language immersion, dual immersion, and indigenous immersion. Foreign language immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English. In the early immersion model, for all or part of the school day elementary school children receive their content (academic) instruction through the medium of another language: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc. In early total immersion models, children receive all the regular kindergarten and first grade content through the medium of the immersion language;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016). How to Implant a Semiotic and Mathematical DNA into Learning English, Seoul: Booklab Publishing Co. (53740), 261 pages. English reading is introduced later, often in the second grade. Most content (math, science, social studies, art, music) continues to be taught through the immersion language. In early partial immersion models, part of the school day (usually 50%) delivers content through the immersion language, and part delivers it through English. French-language immersion programs are common in Canada in the provincial school systems, as part of the drive towards bilingualism and are increasing in number in the United States in public school systems (Curtain & Dahlbert, 2004). Branaman & Rhodes (1998) report that between 1987 and 1997 the percentage of elementary programs offering foreign language education in the U.S. through immersion grew from 2% to 8% and Curtain & Dahlberg (2004) report 278 foreign language immersion programs in 29 states. Research by Swain and others (Genesee 1987) demonstrate much higher levels of proficiency achieved by children in foreign language immersion programs than in traditional foreign language education elementary school models. Dual immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English as well as for students whose home language is the immersion language (usually Spanish). The goal is bilingual students with mastery of both English and the immersion language. As in partial foreign language immersion academic content is delivered through the medium of the immersion language for part of the school day, and through English the rest of the school day. Indigenous immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for American Indian communities desiring to maintain the use of the native language by delivering elementary school content through the medium of that language. Hawaiian Immersion programs are the largest and most successful in this category. = Silent Way = The Silent Way is a discovery learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno in the late 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space for the students to explore the language. Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think. The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way is a good example of the Articulatory Approach. = Community language learning = The community language learning (CLL) is a method proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It is based on the counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques. = Suggestopedia = Suggestopedia was a method that experienced popularity especially in past years, with both staunch supporters and very strong critics, some claiming it is based on pseudoscience. = Natural approach = The natural approach is a language teaching method developed by Stephen Krashen and Tracy D. Terrell. They emphasise the learner receiving large amounts of comprehensible input. The Natural Approach can be categorized as part of the comprehension approach to language teaching. = Total physical response = In total physical response (TPR), the instructor gives the students commands in the target language and the students act those commands out using whole-body responses. This can be categorized as part of the comprehension approach to language teaching. = Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling = Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPR Storytelling or TPRS) was developed by Blaine Ray, a language teacher in California, in the 1990s. At first it was an offshoot of Total Physical Response that also included storytelling, but it has evolved into a method in its own right and has gained a large following among teachers, particularly in the United States. TPR Storytelling can be categorized as part of the comprehension approach to language teaching. =Dogme language teaching= Dogme language teaching is considered to be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to language teaching and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as ‚ÄúDogme ELT‚Äù, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close. = Growing Participator Approach = The Growing Participator Approach (GPA) is an alternative way of thinking about second language acquisition, developed by Greg Thomson. GPA as an approach is usually implemented using Thomson's Six Phase Program (SPP) method, which involves 1,500 hours of special growth participation activities, supported by a local native language speaker, and targeted towards the learners growth zone (Zone of proximal development). The Six Phase Program utilises a number of techniques, such as TPR, to quickly grow the leaners comprehension ability without the use of English. The goal is to help learners continually 'grow' in their ability to meaningful 'participate' in the host culture. GPA influences include Vygotsky, as well as \\"the psycholinguistics of comprehension and production, usage-based approaches to language, linguistic anthropology and discourse analysis.\\" Proprietary methods Some methods are tied to a particular company or school, and are not used in mainstream teaching. Besides those mentioned below, there are dozens of competitors, each slightly different. Notable are the computer courses which use speech recognition to give feedback on pronunciation. =Pimsleur method= Pimsleur language learning system is based on the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher Paul Pimsleur. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages. =Michel Thomas Method= Michel Thomas Method is an audio- based teaching system developed by Michel Thomas, a language teacher in the USA. It was originally done in person, although since his death it is done via recorded lessons. The instruction is done entirely in the student's own language, although the student's responses are always expected to be in the target language. The method focuses on constructing long sentences with correct grammar and building student confidence. There is no listening practice, and there is no reading or writing. The syllabus is ordered around the easiest and most useful features of the language, and as such is different for each language.Michel Thomas: The Learning Revolution, by Jonathan Solity. Other Appropedia is increasingly being used to as a method to enable service learning in language education.E. ter Horst and J. M.

Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL)Levy M. (1997) CALL: context and conceptualisation, Oxford: Oxford University Press. is a method that includes a combination of methods and techniques using the resources available on the internet, as well as a variety of language learning software. There is a lot of language learning software using the multimedia capabilities of computers. = Learning by teaching (LdL) = Learning by teaching is a widespread method in Germany, developed by Jean-Pol Martin. The students take the teacher's role and teach their peers.  See also  * Language education  Notes   References    * * Further reading * Irons, Glenwood H., compiler.

The 1998 Revisions An October 1998 revision to Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034 (10 USC 1034), the \\"Military Whistleblower Protection Act,\\" contained significant changes in how the Military Department Inspectors General and Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense will process reprisal allegations.Military Reprisal Investigations, History of the Military Whistleblower Protection Act . The most significant change in 1998 was that Military Department Inspectors General now have the authority to grant the protection and investigate the reprisal allegations they receive. This means that military members are no longer required to submit reprisal allegations directly with the Department of Defense Inspector General for coverage under 10 USC 1034.Defense Hotline, Whistleblower Protection Information .

In 1988, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988 was passed by the United States Congress to protect military members who make lawful disclosures of wrongdoing to Members of Congress or an Inspector General. It required the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense to investigate allegations of whistleblower reprisal. The statute was broadened in 1991 to protect disclosures to auditors, criminal investigators, inspectors and other Department of Defense law enforcement officers.

The 2013 Revisions On December 12, 2013, the United States House of Representatives approved section 1714 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 overhauling the Military Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988. The Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit public interest group, praised the legislation as the \\"first significant advance in military whistleblower rights since they were enacted in 1988\\" and summarized its provisions as follows: *Statute of Limitations: This period would expand from 60 days to one year, consistent with general best practice whistleblower protections. *Protected Audiences: Audiences for protected disclosures would expand to include testimony to congressional and law enforcement staff, courts, grand jury and court martial proceedings. *Closing Loopholes for Protected Speech: The reform closes the same loopholes that Congress eliminated in the civil service Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. Such loopholes include: A whistleblower is not protected if someone previously disclosed the same misconduct; oral disclosures not being covered; whistleblower motives being challenged, and whether the disclosure was made while on or off duty. *Expansion of Protection against Forms of Harassment: The reforms ban retaliatory removal of duties inconsistent with rank. *Independent Service Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigations: The reforms require service-specific OIG investigations into reprisal to be handled by a higher organizational department than the one where alleged harassment occurred. *Administrative Due Process Hearings: If not satisfied by OIG action, each member has the right to a Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) administrative due process hearing.

Early life and career Wilson was born in Boston in 1881. He was educated at the Phillips Exeter Academy. Career He moved to Philadelphia in 1905 and by 1927 found work as an assistant to the city controller Will B. Hadley. This brought him in contact with Philadelphia political community. In 1930, he worked as a campaign manager for the Republican Gifford Pinchot‚Äôs gubernatorial campaign. This elevated his profile, leading him to a successful candidacy for city controller in 1931. He explored a run for the governor‚Äôs mansion in 1931 as a Democrat but dropped out and supported George Earle, who won the election. He entered the 1935 race for mayor as a Republican after the Democratic Party selected John B. Kelly Sr., a former Olympic rower and the father of Grace Kelly. With the unusually strong challenge from Kelly, Wilson‚Äôs campaign at one point resorted to anti- Semitic rhetoric, accusing Kelly of being beholden to Jewish interests. Wilson won the election, but by only 45,000 votes, a strong result for the Democrats in the reliably Republican city. As mayor, he clashed with Republican leaders and took on the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company and UGI, the city‚Äôs gas operator. In 1937, he re-registered to vote as non-partisan, breaking with the Republican party. He ran in the Democratic primary election for United States Senate against Governor Earle. He had publicly blamed Earle for wiretaps on his secretary‚Äôs phone. The race wasn‚Äôt close and Earle won handily by over 500,000 votes with Davis failing to carry any wards in Philadelphia. Wilson‚Äôs actions cost him much of his political support. The district attorney of Philadelphia secured an indictment against him for failure to stop widespread gambling in the city, but a judge dismissed the charges. He became ill in 1939 and sent a letter to the City Council to have the council president assume his duties on August 11. He died on August 19, 1939 after a stroke. George Connell succeeded him as mayor and served out the rest of his term. References *List of mayors of Philadelphia at Philadelphia Department of Records Further reading * John P.

Eurylaema is a taxonomic section of the flowering plant genus Adenanthos (Proteaceae). It comprises four species, all of which are endemic to southwest Western Australia. Description The section is characterised by flowers in which the stamen on the back of the style is sterile, and the style end is broad and flattened. Taxonomy The section was first described and published by George Bentham in the 1870 fifth volume of his landmark work Flora Australiensis. Bentham listed several diagnostic characters for the species including the bent and dilated perianth-tube; the sterility of one of the four anthers; the broad, flattened style-end; flat, entire leaves; and axillary flowers. He did not give an etymology for the epithet Eurylaema, but Ernest Charles Nelson states that it comes from eurys (\\"broad\\") and laemos (\\"neck\\"), referring to the dilated perianth-tube. Bentham also did not designate a type species for the section; Nelson has since defined A. obovatus to be its lectotype. When published by Bentham in 1870, A. sect. Eurylaema comprised only two species, A. barbigera (now A. barbiger) and A. obovata (now A. obovatus). Four years later, Ferdinand von Mueller published A. detmoldii, referring it to this section. In 1978, Nelson published a comprehensive taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. He retained A. sect. Eurylaema, making no change to its circumscription, but discarded many of Bentham's diagnostic characters, retaining only the sterile anther and the shape of the style-end. The following year, Nelson formally described and named A. √ó pamela, a naturally occurring hybrid of A. detmoldii and A. obovatus. Despite both parents belonging to this section, initially he did not assign the hybrid to it; he did so, however, in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement and circumscription of A. sect. Eurylaema in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. √ó pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos (29 species, 8 subspecies) Distribution and habitat All four species in A. sect.

The bunkers (Albanian: bunker√´t) were built during the intensely Stalinist and anti-revisionist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete bunkers had been constructed around the country.Hapet dosja, ja harta e bunker√´ve dhe tuneleve sekret√´ Hoxha's program of \\"bunkerization\\" (bunkerizimi) resulted in the construction of bunkers in every corner of the then People's Socialist Republic of Albania, ranging from mountain passes to city streets. They were never used for their intended purpose during the years that Hoxha governed. The cost of constructing them was a drain on Albania's resources, diverting them away from more pressing needs, such as dealing with the country's housing shortage and poor roads. The bunkers were abandoned following the dissolution of the communist government in 1992. A few were used in the Albanian insurrection of 1997 and the Kosovo War of 1999. Most are now derelict, though some have been reused for a variety of purposes including residential accommodation, caf√©s, storehouses, and shelters for animals or the homeless. Background From the end of World War II to his death in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued a style of politics informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 in protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. His regime was also hostile towards the country's immediate neighbours. Albania did not end its state of war with Greece, left over from the Second World War, until as late as 1987 ‚Äì two years after Hoxha's death ‚Äì due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state. Hoxha was virulently hostile towards the government of Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia, accusing Tito's government of maintaining \\"an anti-Marxist and chauvinistic attitude towards our Party, our State, and our people\\". He asserted that Tito intended to take over Albania and make it into the seventh republic of Yugoslavia, and castigated the Yugoslav government's treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, claiming that \\"Yugoslav leaders are pursuing a policy of extermination there.\\" Albania still maintained some links with the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former invader Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, who he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Labor Party's control of the country, limited private property, and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world. Military doctrine A bunker on a city street in Shkod√´r. The street's inhabitants would have been expected to defend it. A bunker in a cemetery. Starting in 1967 and continuing until 1986, the Albanian government carried out a policy of \\"bunkerization\\" that saw the construction of hundreds of thousands of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from \\"beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel\\". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, \\"If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it.\\"The Trauma Controversy, p. 177 Albania's military doctrine was based on a concept of \\"people's war\\" drawing on the experience of the Albanian resistance during World War II, which Hoxha had led. The Partisans' victory was mythologized on a massive scale by the Hoxha regime, which used its wartime successes to legitimise its rule. The Albanian People's Army was based on the Partisan model and built around infantry units; 75 percent of the regular forces and 97 percent of reservists were employed in infantry roles.Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity, p. 211 Partisan strategy was mountain-based guerrilla warfare, in which they took refuge in the mountains and launched raids into the less defensible lowlands. By contrast, Hoxha aimed to defend Albania's national integrity and sovereignty \\"at all costs\\", which necessitated defending the lowlands as well. The bunkers were therefore intended to establish defensive positions across the entirety of the country. Smaller ones were laid out in lines radiating out within sight of a large command bunker, which was permanently manned. The commanders of the large bunkers would communicate with their superiors by radio and with the occupants of the smaller bunkers by making visual signals that could be seen through slits. The regime also sought intensively to militarize civilians. 800,000 people out of a population of about three million served in defence in some way, ranging from the regular armed forces and reserves to civil defence and student armed youth units. Many sectors of the government, state-owned businesses and the public service were also given roles in defence, meaning that almost the entire population was brought in one way or another into the scope of state defence planning. From the age of three, Albanians were taught that they had to be \\"vigilant for the enemy within and without\\" and propaganda slogans constantly emphasised the need for watchfulness. Citizens were trained from the age of 12 to station themselves in the nearest bunker to repel invaders. Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local bunkers, and civil defence drills were held at least twice a month, lasting for up to three days, in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued with rifles (but no ammunition). Members of the Young Pioneers, the Hoxhaist youth movement, were trained to defend against airborne invasion by fixing pointed spikes to treetops to impale descending foreign parachutists.Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity, p. 213 Despite the militarization of the population, the Albanian defence system was massively inefficient and took little account of the country's real defence needs; training was minimal, fuel and ammunition were scarce, uniforms and equipment were of poor quality, weapons were antiquated and the military lacked a proper command and control system. Construction The bunkers were constructed of concrete, steel and iron and ranged in size from one- or two-person pillboxes with gun slits to large underground nuclear bomb shelters intended for use by the Party leadership and bureaucrats. The most common type of bunker is a small concrete dome set into the ground with a circular bottom extending downwards, just large enough for one or two people to stand inside. Known as Qender Zjarri (\\"firing position\\") or QZ bunkers, they were prefabricated and transported to their final positions, where they were assembled. They consist of three main elements: a diameter hemispherical concrete dome with a firing slit, a hollow cylinder to support the dome and an outer wall with a radius larger than the cylinder. The gap between the cylinder and outer wall is filled with earth. At various places along the coast, large numbers of QZ bunkers were built in groups of three, linked to each other by a prefabricated concrete tunnel. Elsewhere bunkers were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country, or in lines across swathes of territory.Concrete Mushrooms: Bunkers in Albania, p. 67 Tirana was particularly heavily defended, with thousands of bunkers radiating out in fifty concentric circles around the city. 600px The QZ bunker was designed by military engineer Josif Zagali, who served with the Partisans during World War II and trained in the Soviet Union after the war. He observed how dome-shaped fortifications were virtually impervious to artillery fire and bombs, which simply ricocheted off the dome. He used his knowledge to design the subsequently ubiquitous dome-shaped bunkers. Hoxha was initially delighted with the design and had many thousands of Zagali's bunkers constructed; Zagali himself was promoted to the rank of colonel and became chief engineer of the Albanian Ministry of Defence. However, Hoxha's paranoia led to Zagali being purged in 1974 and imprisoned for eight years on bogus charges of \\"sabotage\\" as a \\"foreign agent\\". His wife went insane, his family was shunned by friends and acquaintances, and his daughter died of breast cancer. Zagali later said that it was \\"a painful and tragic fate not only for me and my family but for thousands and thousands of such families in Albania who have experienced the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha\\". His experiences were later used as the basis of Kolonel Bunker, a film by Albanian director Kujtim √áashku. = Command and control bunkers = The command-and-control bunkers, known as Pike Zjarri (\\"firing point\\") or PZ bunkers, were also prefabricated and assembled on site. They are far larger and heavier than the QZ bunkers, with a diameter of . They are made from a series of concrete slices, each weighing eight or nine tons, which were concreted together on site to form an interlocking dome. Fully assembled, they weigh between 350‚Äì400 tons.Concrete Mushrooms: Bunkers in Albania, p. 75 600px = Large bunkers and tunnels = There was also a third category of larger \\"special structures\\" for strategic purposes. The largest were bunker complexes tunnelled into mountains. At Linza near the capital, Tirana, a network of tunnels some long was built to protect members of the Interior Ministry and the Sigurimi (the secret police) from nuclear attack. Elsewhere, thousands of kilometres of tunnels were built to house political, military and industrial assets. Albania is said to have become the most tunnelled country in the world after North Korea. The tunnels were built in conditions of great secrecy. Engineering teams were not allowed to see construction through to completion but were rotated from site to site on a monthly basis. Impact A line of bunkers in a field in Vermosh The bunkerisation programme was a massive drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost more than twice as much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70‚Äì100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land. A line of bunkers in Dh√´rmi, Himara The bunkerization of the country had effects that went beyond their ubiquitous physical impact on the landscape. The bunkers were presented by the Party as both a symbol and a practical means of preventing Albania's subjugation by foreign powers, but some viewed them as a concrete expression of Hoxha's policy of isolationism ‚Äì keeping the outside world at bay. Some Albanians saw them as an oppressive symbol of intimidation and control. Ismail Kadare used the bunkers in his 1996 novel The Pyramid to symbolize the Hoxha regime's brutality and control, while √áashku has characterised the bunkers as \\"a symbol of totalitarianism\\" because of the \\"isolation psychology\\" that they represented. It has been argued that the bunkerization programme was a form of \\"patterned large-scale construction\\" that \\"has a disciplinary potential as a means of familiarizing a population with a given order of rule\\". The regime's xenophobia had the effect of creating a siege mentality and a sense of constant emergency. Hoxha's strategy of \\"people's war\\" also caused friction with the Albanian Army. The bunkers had little military value compared with a conventionally equipped and organised professional army. As one commentator has put it, \\"How long could one man in each bunker hold out? How would you resupply each individual bunker? How would they communicate with each other?\\" General Beqir Balluku, the Defense Minister and a member of the Politburo, publicly criticized the bunker system in a 1974 speech and disputed Hoxha's line that Albania was under equal threat from the United States and the Soviet Union.Albania as Dictatorship and Democracy, p. 632 He argued that Albania needed a modern, well-equipped professional army rather than a poorly trained and equipped civilian militia. Hoxha responded by having Ballaku arrested, accusing him of being an agent of the Chinese and of working to bring about a military coup. Dubbed \\"the arch-traitor Ballaku\\", the general and his associates were convicted and punished according to \\"the laws of the dictatorship of the proletariat\\" ‚Äì meaning that they were executed. Many other military figures, such as bunker designer Josif Zagali, were also caught up in the 1974 purges. The introduction of a new constitution two years later sealed Hoxha's absolute control of the military by appointing him as Commander-in- Chief of the Albanian People's Army and Chairman of the Defence Council.Albania as Dictatorship and Democracy, p. 633 Post-Hoxha A Pike Zjarri bunker being used as a house in 1994 Checkpoint memorial in Tirana near the former secluded area of Blloku. It features a bunker, pillars from Spac prison, and a Berlin Wall fragment. An uprooted bunker in Valbon√´, 2009 The bunkerization programme was stopped soon after Hoxha's death in 1985, leaving Albania's towns and countryside dotted with vast numbers of defensive bunkers. They still dominate the Albanian landscape. A BBC reporter described in 1998 how they were ubiquitous on the road between Tirana and the city's airport, \\"looking down from every hillside, sprouting out of every bank\\". Their solidity has made it difficult to get rid of them. Some have been removed, particularly in cities, but in the countryside most bunkers have simply been abandoned. Some have been reused as housing for animals or as storehouses; others have been abandoned to lie derelict due to the cost of removing them. The extreme secrecy of Hoxha's regime meant that Albania's subsequent governments lacked information on how the bunkers had been used, or even how many had been built. In 2004 Albanian officials discovered a forgotten stockpile of 16 tons of mustard gas and other chemical weapons in an unguarded bunker only from Tirana. The United States government gave Albania $20 million to destroy the weapons. In other places, abandoned bunkers have become a lethal danger. In 2008 alone, at least five holiday-makers drowned when they were caught in whirlpools created by water currents around bunkers that had subsided into the sea. The Albanian army has carried out bunker removal programmes along the coastline, dragging them out of the ground with modified Type 59 tanks. Although the bunkers were never used in a real conflict during Hoxha's rule, some found use in conflicts that broke out in the 1990s. During the Albanian insurrection of 1997, the townspeople of Sarand√´ in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels. After the outbreak of the Kosovo War of 1999, border villages in Albania were repeatedly shelled by Serbian artillery batteries located in nearby Kosovo and local people used the bunkers to shelter from the shelling. Kosovo Albanian refugees took to using bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies could move them into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers to fortify their base at Kuk√´s. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, though this was not without its risks; on at least one occasion bunkers along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft. An acute shortage of housing after the fall of the Hoxha dictatorship in 1992 led some Albanians to set up homes in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy. A few bunkers have found more creative uses. In the coastal city of Durr√´s one beachside bunker has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri,The Trauma Controversy, p. 179 and another bunker in Gjirokast√´r was turned into a caf√©. There have been various suggestions for what to do with them: ideas have included pizza ovens, solar heaters, beehives, mushroom farms, projection rooms for drive-in cinemas, beach huts, flower planters, youth hostels, and kiosks. Some Albanians have taken to using the bunkers for more romantic purposes. In a country where until recently cars were in short supply, they were popular places for lovers to have sex; as travel writer Tony Wheeler puts it, \\"Albanian virginity is lost in a Hoxha bunker as often as American virginity was once lost in the back seats of cars.\\" In November 2014, a \\"five star\\" nuclear shelter built near Tirana for Hoxha was opened as a tourist attraction and art exhibition. The large bunker contains a museum with exhibits from World War II and the Hoxhaist period. Albania's bunkers have even become a symbol of sorts for the country. Pencil holders and ashtrays in the shape of bunkers have become one of the country's most popular tourist souvenirs. One such line of bunker souvenirs was promoted with a message to buyers: \\"Greetings to the land of the bunkers. We assumed that you could not afford to buy a big one.\\" See also *Architecture of Albania References External links * Mushrooms of Concrete from International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam * Paranoid Dictator‚Äôs Communist-Era Bunkers Now a National Nuisance from Wired Magazine *Awaiting the Enemy that Never Came: The Bunkers of Albania from Atlas Obscura *Underground Bunker of Enver Hoxha Official Website *Albania Has a Bunker Problem from War is Boring Category:People's Socialist Republic of Albania Category:Fortifications in Albania Category:Bunkers in Europe Category:Concrete shell structures ","title":"Bunkers in Albania"},{"id":"29572737","text":"Epicephala pyrrhogastra is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

Career  Little biographical information exists on Cambon's early years, other than that he would have been active as an aquarelle and sepia artist before studying with Pierre-Luc Charles Ciceri. At Ciceri's workshop Cambon made acquaintance with Humanit√©-Ren√© Philastre, who would become his first long-term associate. Set design for Act V, Scene 2 of La reine de Chypre (1841) Collaboration with upright=1.3 As a stage design for a \\"Salon\\" at the Biblioth√®que-Mus√©e de l'Op√©ra testifies, Philastre and Cambon started collaborating in 1824 at the latest. From that time until 1848, Philastre and Cambon accepted numerous joint commissions for theatrical interior decorations and stage designs. Thus, they decorated the interiors of venues in Angoul√™me, Antwerp, Beaune, Brest, Choiseul, Dijon, Douai, Ghent, Lille, Lyon, Paris and Rouen, often providing complete machineries as well. Philastre and Cambon also designed productions ‚Äì or portions thereof, as was customary back then ‚Äì for Paris (Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, Ambigu, Bouffes-Parisiens, Cirque Olympique, Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, D√©lassements-Comiques, Folies-Dramatiques, Porte Saint-Martin), Antwerp (Th√©√¢tre Royal Fran√ßais), Barcelona (Liceu) and Ghent (Grand Th√©√¢tre) that created the blueprint for grand op√©ra and romantic scenography in Europe. Notable stagings to which Philastre and Cambon contributed are the world premieres of Auber's Gustave III, ou Le bal masque (1833), Berlioz' Benvenuto Cellini (1838), Donizetti's La favorite (1840), Hal√©vy's La juive (1835), and Hugo's Les Burgraves (1843). Cambon separated from Philastre in 1848 as the latter emigrated to Spain. He found a new associate in an extremely talented student, Joseph Thierry, with whom Cambon would design epoch-making productions for the Ch√¢telet, Op√©ra, Op√©ra-Comique, Th√©√¢tre-Historique, and Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique in Paris. Examples of Cambon and Thierry's joint oeuvre include the world premieres of Berlioz' Les Troyens √† Carthage (1863), Gounod's Faust (1859) and La reine de Saba (1862), Meyerbeer's Le proph√®te (1849) and L'Africaine (1865), Verdi's J√©rusalem (1847) and Don Carlos (1867), and Wagner's Tannh√§user (Parisian version, 1861).oxfordindex.oup.com, Benezit Dictionary of Artistsoxfordindex.oup.com, Grove Music Online After Thierry's premature death, in 1866, Cambon continued to work in full independence for venues in Cairo (Khedivial Opera) and Paris (Od√©on, Op√©ra and Vaudeville), decorating a.o. the world premieres of Delibes' Copp√©lia (1870) and of Thomas' Hamlet (1868), next to a large number of the Palais Garnier's first-generation productions (a.o. Don Giovanni, Faust, La favorite, Guillaume Tell, Hamlet, Les Huguenots, Jeanne d'Arc and La juive). Cambon was to co-design the premiere of Verdi's Aida (1871), but dropped out of the production due to unknown circumstances. Cambon taught many pupils at his scenic studio at 3 rue Neuve-Samson (currently rue L√©on-Jouhaux, Xme Arrondissement). Students of note are Antoine Lavastre and Eug√®ne Louis Carpezat (his official successors), Ch√©ret, Jean-√âmile Daran, C√©lestin- Fran√ßois-Louis Gosse, Eug√®ne Lacoste, Jules-Fr√©d√©ric Le Goff, Francesc Soler Rovirosa, and Angelo II Quaglio. Cambon was named 'Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur' in 1869. He was a friend of Prosper M√©rim√©e and Stendhal. Cambon's funeral service at Saint-Denis-du-Sacrement and subsequent burial at Montmartre Cemetery were reportedly attended by Camille du Locle, √âmile Perrin and √âdouard Thierry, as well as by the complete crew of the Op√©ra.  Style  La Esmeralda, Act III, Scene 1 La Esmeralda, Act III, Scene 2. Although Cambon, like most contemporary scenographers, created scenery of various types and styles during his long career, it was in architectural settings that he achieved true excellence. In keeping with the romantic need for couleur locale and couleur historique, Cambon aimed at the illusionistic rendering of architectural space, the character and atmosphere of which he enhanced through the use of dramatic points of view and clair-obscur. Cambon's designs and scale-models in Cont√© crayon, sepia or pastel furthermore reveal an exquisite draughtsmanship in its own right. Though lacking the rich palette of most contemporaries and successors, Cambon's interiors and exteriors are characterized by precise, delicate lines that belie a solid sense of architectural composition and knowledge of each play or opera's spatial needs.  Preserved works  On 17 May 1877, 2,000 designs by Cambon were sold by his widow at the H√¥tel Drouot in Paris. Two hundred of these were acquired by the Biblioth√®que-Mus√©e de l'Op√©ra, which would also preserve Cambon's maquettes for the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique from 1866 onwards. A number of scale-models predating 1866 have also been preserved. Other stage designs by Cambon are held at the Archives of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise.

Founded by Pauline Kidner in 1984, this charity specializes in the rescue, rehabilitation and release of British wildlife. They work on an 8 am ‚Äì 8 pm basis 365 days a year, with a team of experts on hand for any casualty or orphan that may be brought in. Each year they rescue roughly 5,000 wild animals, from badgers and otters to swans and birds of prey. They rely greatly on the work of their volunteers, with volunteer response drivers located across Somerset, Bristol, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon and South Gloucestershire who are all trained to bring in a variety of different British wildlife. Volunteer animal carers who help care for the animals and receptionists are also vital to their operations. Supporters of the center include Simon King, Chris Packham, Martin Hughes- Games, Michaela Strachan, Tony Head, Chris Sperring, Mike Dilger, Jilly Cooper, Valerie Singleton, Desmond Morris and Sarah Fisher.  Mission  The group aim to care for wildlife species so they recover their health and can be returned to live with a high quality of life in the wild. In this sense, the organisation sees itself as a staging post for animals prior to their release, rather than as a zoo where animals are kept indefinitely. They aim to return all animals back to where they were found, however this is not always possible so instead, they find them the most suitable alternative release sites. Another of secret worlds missions is to educate and inform the general public about British Wildlife. Throughout the year their learning team spend their time visiting local schools and hosting schools onsite in the newly completed learning facility, to teach the students about all the different creatures the British countryside has to offer. There are specific days in the year when Secret World opens to the public, with animal talks taking place so the visitors can also learn about these animals. = Rescue, rehabilitation and release = Animals are either brought in by members of the public or picked up by one of their many volunteer response drivers who are located across the South West. Receptionists at Secret World are on hand from 8 am to 8 pm, where they answer calls to help analyse the situation, with animal carers nearby to help give any advice when needed. Once an animal is brought in it will be assessed and veterinary care is given if needed. Whilst there the animal will continue to be looked after with volunteers and workers giving 24 hour care, giving them their hourly feeds or whatever the animal may require. On site they have extensive facilities, with hospital rooms, and treatment and recovery areas which help in giving all casualties the best possible chance in recovery. During the rehabilitation process, every effort is made to reduce the risk of imprinting, by reducing human interaction and contact where ever possible. After the rehabilitation process the next stage is for the animal to be released, and they make sure they are 100% recovered and ready before being released. They aim to release the animals where they were found, in a hope to be reunited with their families and homes however this is not always possible. Potential sites are surveyed and vetted for suitability. They specialize in 'soft-releases', enclosures that are set up where the animals are to be released. Here the animal will stay for a few weeks, still without human contact, getting used to the environment and overall settling in, before the gates are opened and they are free to live their lives in the wild. Many animals are also monitored after release. This whole process from rescue to release aims to give the animals the best chance of survival, and the animals needs are always prioritized.  History  Secret World, located New Road farm was originally a dairy farm ran by Pauline Kidner and her husband, Derek. Pauline was known for bringing in injured wildlife and nursing them back to health and after opening the farm to the general public, people started bringing injured wildlife to her. This continued for a few years before Pauline and Derek decided to set up a charity to support their work, and in 1993 Bluebell Sett was born, named after one of the badgers Pauline had previously cared for. And with this the farm's name was changed to Secret World. And in 1995 Bluebell Sett was a registered charity. However 10 years later this was renamed to Secret World Wildlife Rescue.  Media coverage  Since their opening Secret World has received much media coverage especially from local newspapers. However, their coverage has not been restricted to regional media outlets and have also featured on national television shows such as: CBBC's Junior Vets and Countryfile. And in 2013 Secret World was also a filming location for the BBC's The Burrowers: Animals Underground, presented by Secret World supporter and patron Chris Packham. However one of the most notable television appearances is in ITV's Secret World (2000). This focused on Pauline Kidner and Secret World and threw them into the spotlight, with the casualties being admitted rising from 1000 a year to 3000 a year after the show aired.

Generally, a control system is concerned with measurement and control of one or multiple properties in time in a single dimension. A QCS is designed to continuously measure and control the material properties of the moving sheet in two dimensions: in the machine direction (MD) and the cross- machine direction (CD). The ultimate goal is maintaining a good and homogenous quality and meeting users' economic goals. A basic quality measurement system generally includes basis weight and moisture profile measurements and in addition average basis weight of the paper web and moisture control related to these variables. Caliper is also one of the basic measurements. Other commonly used continuous measurements include: ash content, color, brightness, smoothness and gloss, coat weight, formation, porosity, fiber orientation, and surface properties (topography). QCS is used in paper machines, board machines, tissue machines, pulp drying machines, and other plastic or metal film processes In modern systems QCS applications can be embedded to distributed control systems.  Sensor platform  Sensors measuring the paper quality (online meters) are attached to a sensor platform that move across the web guided by the scanner beam. A typical crossing time for a sensor platform is 10‚Äì30 s (an 8 m web, 60 cm/s). The sensor platform scans across the paper web and continuously measures paper characteristics from edge to edge. It can also be directed and stopped to a specific, fixed point on the web to measure the machine-direction (MD) variation at a single point.  Scanner beam  The QCS scanner beam is an essential part of a QCS system. Wide machines and accurate profile calculations require beam stability and accuracy of mechanical movement. As high accuracy in demanding and variable conditions is required, the sensitive sensors must be securely fastened. The most important goal is maintaining the exact respective position of the upper and lower measurement platforms in relation to their distance from each other, in MD and in CD . This is achieved through a robust construction and by reducing the effects of temperature and other environmental effects and through a moving mechanism with minimized backlash of the measurement platform. Usually the scanner beam also contains all the cables and the air, cooling liquid and protection gas pipes. The base of the scanner beam contains elements that dampen vertical vibration.  Variables to be measured  A basic quality measurement system generally includes basis weight and moisture profile measurements and in addition average basis weight of the paper web and moisture control related to these variables. Caliper is also one of the basic measurements. Other commonly used continuous measurements include: ash content, color, brightness, smoothness and gloss, coat weight, formation], porosity, fiber orientation, and surface properties (topography).  Measurement process  Online sensors are set on the scanner beam to scan across the web. Typical crossing time of the web in new systems is 10‚Äì30 s (8m web, 60 cm/s). If the web speed is 1200 m/min and web width 8.5 m, the web moves 280 m during a scan, and the sensor moves the same distance diagonally across the web. The measurements are taken on the diagonal line and act as basis for profile (machine and cross-direction) and variation calculations. This value is subject to integration depending on the machine speed. If the measurement signal sampling frequency is in size range 2000/s, then the smallest measurement element is about 0.2 cm in cross-direction. The measurement data is integrated to eliminate a small-scale formation variation from the measurement result. The measurement value is averaged so that each sensor gives one measurement value per one data box which is typically from 5 mm to one centimeter of web width. For a 1 meter wide web, for instance, 100 - 200 measurement values are taken. These measurement values from a single scan (profile points) are called 'raw profiles'. In modern quality control systems, the width of these data boxes can be changed, and accurate profiles can be formed using several thousands profile data boxes. Typically, the sensor's output is the instantaneous value, the profile average value and the complete profile.  Sensor requirements  The requirements for an ideal paper machine online sensor include the following: the sensor is calibrated to a natural constant during the measurement; the sensor and the related electronics include fault diagnostics; digital processing of the signal is possible from the start without destroying the possibility of analyzing large frequency components; the sensor system does not disturb the production; the measurements are performed real-time and can be adjusted without delays; the measurement concerns the entire production, not just small sample values. It must be possible to distinguish between the machine-directional and cross- directional deviation and the residual deviation as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data.

In the context of the second Dutch invasions in Brazil, it was originally a small island (now lost) in front of the tip of the Southeast Itamarac√° Island, where the bar dominated the southern channel of Santa Cruz.  History  = Background: The Dutch fort = Fort Orange in Pernambuco It was started from May 1631 as a fortification campaign by Dutch forces (Barretto, 1958:133), under the command of Steyn Callenfels and received the name Fort Orange, in homage to the House of Orange-Nassau, which then ruled the Netherlands. It was garrisoned by a detachment of 366 men under the command of the Polish Captain Crestofle d'Artischau Arciszewski. This effectively resisted the Portuguese forces commanded by Conde of Bagnoli, who defeated (1632), withdrew abandoning its artillery: four pieces of brass brought from Arraial Velho do Bom Jesus. This position formed the basis for the conquest of the island of Itamarac√°, defended by the forces of Salvador Pinheiro. After this achievement (1633), the fort was repaired and expanded. In this structure, Maurice of Nassau reported: This is complemented by van der Dussen, which gives two companies with a headcount of 182 men: Barl√©u (1974) transcribes the information: According to Bento (1971), when the Portuguese counter-offensive to the island of Itamarac√° in June 1646 by the combined forces of the Master-of-Field Andr√© Vidal de Negreiros (1606‚Äì80) and Master- of-Field Jo√£o Fernandes Vieira (1602‚Äì81) Sergeant-Major Antonio Dias Cardoso was in charge of attack and raze the fortifications Dutch, which was met, eighteen pieces Fettering artillery, and organizing strongholds bordering the island with some of these pieces. Although it is unclear whether this was achieved particularly strong or not, on occasion the fort suffered heavy damage and was rebuilt from 1649. = Under Portuguese rule = After the Dutch capitulation in Recife (1654), and subsequently abandoned the fort occupied by the Portuguese forces under the command of Colonel Francisco de Figueroa (GARRIDO, 1940:62). Renamed asFort of Santa Cruz de Itamarac√°, the Portuguese military engineer continued the reconstruction in stone masonry and lime in the form of a quadrangular polygon with regular pentagonal bastions at the corners in the system Vauban, Bartizans from stone, armorial gate, and barracks for the troops, and lockers under the walls, enveloping the embankment. Despite undergoing repairs in 1696 - when its garrison consisted of a Sergeant-Major, a Captain, a Lieutenant, a Sergeant, a Constable, and two companies of Thirds of Recife and is strapped with twenty-five cannon of sizes from 20 to 12 (GARRIDO, 1940:62) - and 1777 in 1800, it was abandoned and in ruins. New restoration was provided in 1817, the year that was occupied by the forces of Father Ten√≥rio, in the context of Pernambuco Revolution (1817). SOUZA (1885), at the time (1885), gave him twenty-three pieces, pointing him to ruin (op. cit., P. 81). = Today = 300px Protected in 1938 by then National Historic and Artistic Heritage Services, consolidation by small interventions performed in 1966 and 1973, a time when the island began to project itself as tourist resort. In 1971, the Archaeology Laboratory of the Federal University of Pernambuco held the fort prospecting in part, identified areas of the kitchen, the chapel, the rooms and lockers, and recovering various objects of personal use, guns and ammunition of various calibres. The Department of the Army began their reforms in the early 1980s, from the administration for the City of Itamarac√° (1984). It is from this period date the involvement of ex-convict and craftsman Jos√© Amaro de Souza Filho with storage and maintenance freestanding monument by revenue from the sale of crafts place, a situation that lasted until 1992. From 1991, with the creation by Jos√© Amaro of the Fort Orange Foundation, this entity began to take charge of the administration of the fort, until 1998. At this point, the property was taken over by City Hall being passed to the Ministry of Culture (1998), which in turn forwarded it to the Foundation to Support the Development of the Federal University of Pernambuco, Fade/UFPE. The Fade, a private nonprofit, from 2000 coordinated the project of archaeological research, UFPE Project (Fort Orange), with funding from the MOWIC Foundation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Ministry of Culture of Brazil, by the Iphan, and the State Government of Pernambuco. Two new campaigns archaeological prospection took place: the first of January to March 2002 and the second from October 2002 to June 2003. The work also included building defenses against the sea, with funding from the City Council as well as interventions of restoration and installation of a museum containing the archaeological remains found in excavations, with funding from the State of Pernambuco and Iphan.  Tourism and Access  Located in the city of Itamaraca, and about 50 km north of Recife, can be accessed by highways BR-101 North, PE and PE-35-01. Tours are daily from 8 am to 5 pm. With an influx of visitors currently estimated at around 70 thousand people per year, the structure of the fort is one of the most important tourism attractions of Pernambuco. Under good storage conditions are recommended to visit the Chapel, as well as studio and craft shop of Joseph Amaro, specializing in carved wood.  Bibliography  * Barl√©u Gaspar.

It is known from Tamil Nadu, India.Global Taxonomic Database of Gracillariidae (Lepidoptera) The wingspan is 5.3-6.6 mm. The larvae feed on Phyllanthus niruri. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The first instar larva mines the lower layer of spongy parenchyma just above the lower epidermis, and makes a small blotch-mine or sometimes a linear mine along the leaf-vein. In the second instar, the larva broadens the mine into a large blotch, which finally occupies almost the full area between two branching veins. Up to this stage, the mine is flat and seen only on the lower surface of the leaf, the mining part being whitish in colour. In the third and fourth instars, the larva which has been transformed into tissue-feeding type, feeds on the remaining tissues within the blotch-mine. The tissues are consumed by the fourth instar larva, thus the upper epidermis of the mining part is completely separated from the lower and turns pale or deep brown in colour. The fully matured mine is slightly contorted by larval silken threads into a tentiform one. The fifth instar larva leaves the mine and migrates to another leaf, which is usually located more distally on the branch. It cuts the leaf from the edge towards the midrib. The part cut off is rolled up from the edge to form a cone on the underside of the leaf, then the larva continues to feed inside the cone. The larva passes two instars within this cone, or may changes the leaf to make another cone. When fully grown, the larva forms a whitish, spindle-shaped cocoon inside the cone, which has a small, round, semitransparent window on the side near the base.

It served as the main Coburg residence for the ruling princes from the 1540s until 1918. The palace's exterior today mostly reflects Gothic Revival style. History The palace was built by Johann Ernst, Duke of Saxe- Coburg, in 1543-7. It replaced the Veste Coburg as the dukes' town Residenz. The new town palace was built around a Franciscan monastery dissolved during Reformation. According to tradition, the palace was named Ehrenburg (\\"Palace of Honour\\") by Emperor Charles V for having been constructed without the use of forced labour. Under Duke Johann Casimir the first major rebuilding took place. Around 1590 the (still extant) south wing was constructed by the Renaissance architect Michael Frey. In 1690, a fire destroyed the northern part of the palace. This was an opportunity for Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg, who had a new Baroque style palace built in 1699. The construction of a new chapel in the west wing, the east wing and the central part of the building gave the Ehrenburg the basic structure it retains today. In the 19th century, Ernst I had the palace redesigned by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in English Gothic Revival style, beginning in 1810. Most of the work took place between 1816 and 1840, with the palace fa√ßade clothed in sandstone. Ehrenburg Palace, 2013 Hall of Giants Also between 1816 and 1840 the state apartments were redesigned in the French Empire style. Because the palace was the home of the ducal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (previously Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld), many royal occasions happened here. In 1863, Queen Victoria (whose mother, Princess Victoria, and husband, Prince Albert, grew up here) met Austrian Emperor Franz Josef for the first time in the Hall of Giants (a sign marks the occasion). In 1894, the wedding of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha brought together, at the palace, Queen Victoria, her son the future King Edward VII, her grandson the future King George V, her daughter German Empress Victoria, her other grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II, her son's nephew the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (with her granddaughter, future Tsarina Alexandra), and many other royalty from England, Greece, Belgium, Romania, Portugal and elsewhere.

It is currently working closely with the governments of Punjab, Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on medium-term economic planning. Research funded by the IGC into the Pakistan football-making industry found that despite supplying firms with cost-cutting technology, take-up rates of the new technology were low due to misaligned incentives between workers and the company. The organization has also funded research into low tax collection in Punjab, and successfully instituted a 'pay for performance' scheme in Punjab that raised significant tax revenue. The IGC Rwanda programme began operations in November 2010, at the request of President Paul Kagame. It operates under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Rwanda) which requires that it ‚Äúproduce demand-driven research outputs that strengthen the evidence base for policy-making relevant to Rwanda‚Äôs long-run growth‚Äù, with a focus on research and analysis under four main thematic areas: agriculture, infrastructure, macroeconomic policy and finance, and trade and industry. The IGC participated in a Rwanda Research Roundtable in 2014 as part of its partnership with the Rwandan government. A joint NAEB-IGC study on the Rwandan coffee sector found that Rwandan export revenues are affected by coffee washing stations operating below capacity, with the majority of the washing stations lacking funding. The IGC Sierra Leone programme is based at the Centre of Policy Studies at the University of Sierra Leone. Its main areas of research are state capabilities, agriculture, and governance. Research conducted by the IGC has found that the number of rice traders in some Ebola- hit areas of Sierra Leone has fallen by nearly 70% between 2012 and late 2014. The economic consequences of Ebola in Sierra Leone are continuing to be monitored by the IGC. The IGC South Sudan programme opened in August 2012.

The IGC state research programme looks at the role of the public sector in economic development. Within the State research theme, the IGC has worked on 364 projects and organised 33 events. The state research programme is headed by Professor Oriana Bandiera (London School of Economics and Political Science), Professor Henrik Kleven (London School of Economics and Political Science), Professor Eliana La Ferrera (Bocconi University), and Professor Gerard Padro i Miquel (London School of Economics and Political Science). One IGC state project run by Raj Chetty (Harvard University), Nasiruddin Ahmed (BRAC University), Ghulam Hossain (Chairman of the Pakistani National Board of Revenue), Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak (Yale University), Aminur Rahman (University of Virginia), and Monica Singhal (Harvard University) looked at how social recognition can be used to increase value-added tax revenue in Pakistan. The researchers sent letters to inform firms that their tax compliance behaviour would be shared with other firms in their cluster in a subsequent letter. They hypothesised that this intervention may spur voluntary tax compliance by allowing firms to be recognised by their neighbours and peers. They found that in areas of low tax compliance, where less than 15% of firms paid any VAT the previous year (in 2012), the peer recognition treatment had no significant effect on tax payment rates. However, in areas where at least 15% of firms had paid VAT in 2012, firms who received the peer recognition treatment were 3.4 percentage points more likely to make a payment in the post-intervention period The IGC firms research programme seeks to understand the forces that determine the productivity of firms. Within the Firms research theme, the IGC has worked on 293 projects and organised 25 events. The IGC's Firms research programme is headed by Professor Nicholas Bloom (Stanford University), Professor Tavneet Suri (MIT Sloan School of Management), Professor Christopher Udry (Yale University), Professor Eric Verhoogen (Columbia University), Dr Greg Fischer (London School of Economics and Political Science), Professor Imran Rasul (University College London), Professor Andres Rodriguez-Clare (University of California, Berkeley), and Professor Christopher Woodruff (University of Warwick). An IGC firms project in Sialkot, Pakistan, one of the world's top producers of footballs, found that employees in factories producing footballs resisted a new technology that limited waste and improved efficiency. Researchers found a new way to cut the footballs' pentagon panels from sheets of rexine, and they provided football manufacturers with a new cutting pattern and new cutting tools to implement the new design. While one of the largest companies in the city quickly adopted the new technology for almost all its production, few others followed suit. Based on further investigation, the researchers conjectured that take-up was slow because employees were resisting the new technology. Cutters were paid per piece, with no incentive to reduce waste, and were concerned that the new die would slow them down and reduce their incomes. The IGC cities research programme explores the challenges of urbanisation in the developing world and the potential of cities to act as drivers of economic growth. The IGC's cities research programme is led by Edward Glaeser (Harvard University) and Gharad Bryan (London School of Economics and Political Science). 45 projects and nine events have been funded through the IGC cities programme. The IGC energy research programme analyses the role that energy plays in shaping the growth of developing countries. Within the Energy research theme, the IGC has worked on 55 projects and organised four events. The energy programme is headed by Professor Michael Greenstone (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Professor Nicholas Ryan (Yale University). Events The IGC holds a number of events throughout the year with the purpose of discussing a wide range of economic growth-related issues, sharing the findings of its research, and stimulating policy debates within the IGC's four thematic focus areas: cities, energy, state effectiveness, and firms. IGC events focus on combining research and policy and feature speakers from IGC's network of researchers and policymakers from Africa and South Asia. The IGC's flagship events are ‚ÄúGrowth Week‚Äù, its annual conference in London, and a series of smaller regional and thematic conferences held in the UK, Africa, and South Asia with the aim of forging collaborations between policymakers and academics. In addition, a number of in-country research dissemination and policy events and workshops are held every year. The IGC also holds a number of public lectures at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

It is a personal exploration of the history of horror film, inspired by Gatiss's lifelong enthusiasm for the genre. The documentary was directed by John Das (episodes one and three) and Rachel Jardine (episode two); series consultant was actor and film historian Jonathan Rigby. The series was initially broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four from 11 to 25 October 2010. Each of the three episodes lasted 60 minutes. It received strong reviews from the British press, the Irish press and independent review sites. Episodes =\\"Frankenstein Goes To Hollywood\\"= In the first episode, Gatiss explores the Golden Age of Hollywood horror, or the Universal era, the 1920s to 1940s. He looks at the silent film The Phantom of the Opera (1925), starring Lon Chaney, the first great horror talkie Dracula (1931), starring B√©la Lugosi, and the later release of James Whale's Frankenstein (1931), featuring Boris Karloff. He focuses in particular on Son of Frankenstein (1939), a personal favourite which he feels has been neglected. The episode includes interviews with John Carpenter, Sara Karloff, Gloria Stuart, Carla Laemmle, Donnie Dunagan, and Sheila Wynn (Lugosi's co-star in a 1951 Dracula tour). =\\"Home Counties Horror\\"= The second episode focuses on the British Hammer Films of the 1950s and 1960s, which inspired Gatiss' childhood passion for horror. He meets key figures from Hammer to discuss the series of Frankenstein and Dracula films which made stars of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, both of whom Gatiss argues are underrated talents. He also identifies a short-lived subgenre of British folk horror drawing on paganism and folklore, including Witchfinder General (1968), his personal favourite Blood on Satan's Claw (1970) and The Wicker Man (1973). This episode includes interviews with writer-producer Anthony Hinds, writer-director Jimmy Sangster, director Roy Ward Baker, Barbara Steele, star of Black Sunday (1960), director-producer Roger Corman, director Piers Haggard, John Carpenter again, and actors Barbara Shelley and David Warner. Also included are archive interviews with Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. =\\"The American Scream\\"= In the third and final episode, Gatiss looks at American horror movies of the late 1960s and 1970s, including Night of the Living Dead (1968) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). As well as the emergence of slasher films, Gatiss examines the other great horror film trend of the era, the theme of Satanism and demonic possession in films such as Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Exorcist (1973) and The Omen (1976). This episode includes interviews with writer David Seltzer and directors Tobe Hooper and George A. Romero, who also made Martin (1978), another personal favourite which Gatiss considers neglected. Gatiss meets David Warner, Barbara Steele and John Carpenter again, accompanying Carpenter on a tour of the set locations for Halloween (1978). He also visits the Bates Motel, the set location for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Horror Europa The series was followed in October 2012 by Horror Europa, a 90-minute exploration of European horror that reunited Gatiss with director John Das and consultant Jonathan Rigby. Gatiss' interviewees included Harry K√ºmel, Annette Chaton (daughter of Thomas Narcejac), √âdith Scob, Fabrizio Bava (grandson of Mario Bava), Dario Argento, Narciso Ib√°√±ez Serrador, Jorge Grau, Guillermo del Toro, and Barbara Steele. Among films covered were Daughters of Darkness, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Nosferatu, The Hands of Orlac, Les Diaboliques, Eyes Without a Face, Black Sabbath, Blood and Black Lace, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Suspiria, La residencia, Who Can Kill a Child?, The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue, The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth, and Shivers. The documentary was previewed at London's National Film Theatre on 28 October (followed by an on-stage discussion between Gatiss, Das and Rigby) and first broadcast two days later.

History The route of the Liberty Trail route is based on information recorded by six rebels from various villages in Somerset and Dorset. Villagers from the two counties made their way to join the Protestant Monmouth Rebellion in 1685. The rebels wore green sprigs tucked into their hats to declare their support for Monmouth. Weapons that they carried included farm scythes and other suitable agricultural tools. Route 240px Ham Hill is at its highest point, and Lyme Regis is at sea level. Below are six possible walking stages that may be used to traverse the Liberty Trail: *Ham Hill to West Chinnock - - 1.75 hours *West Chinnock to Misterton - - 2.5 hours *Misterton to Wayford - - 2 hours *Wayford to Thorncombe - - 3 hours *Thorncombe to Wootton Fitzpaine - - 2.75 hours *Wootton Fitzpaine to Lyme Regis - - 2 hours Places of interest At Ham Hill there are links with other Trails including the Monarch's Way, Leland Trail and River Parrett Trail. Ham Hill Iron Age Hill Fort is one of the largest in Europe. Many local buildings are made from the local yellow Hamstone. At Wayford is Clapton Court Gardens, one of Somerset's more historic gardens that are open to the public. Forde Abbey is situated on a curved section of the River Axe, its original purpose was as a Cistercian Monastery. It has a garden of some elegance which has won many awards. At this location the Dorset Jubilee Trail crosses over the path of the Liberty Trail. Two other Iron Age Hill Forts may be seen at this stage, the first one is Lambert's Castle and further on is Coney's Castle. During clear weather conditions Chesil Beach and Portland Bill are visible, both are famous features of this part of the South coast of England. Lyme Regis is located to the west of Chesil Beach on the Jurassic Coast, a place where many fossils may be found. The Cobb at Lyme Regis was the location for The French Lieutenant's Woman (film) in 1981. The South West Coast Path also leads into this part of the town.

The ENSEEIHT is part of Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse (Toulouse INP) which is itself part of the University of Toulouse. The school is also an associated school of the Institut Mines-T√©l√©com. History The school was founded in 1907 by the Toulouse city council with the purpose of training engineers for the South-Western France electrical and hydraulic networks development. In the 1930s, Charles Camichel, the first director of the school, develops research on hydraulics. Hydraulics then contributed to the reputation of the school. In 1948, the school has become an ENSI - French abbreviation for National Superior School of Engineering - under the direction of L√©opold Escande. This was an acknowledgement of the high level of the training and the research works. Admissions As a Grande √âcole, the school recruits the majority of the students after the selection made by the competitive examination which is the final step of two years of intensive Classes Pr√©paratoires aux Grandes √âcoles. Each department has its own required admission rank that is determined by the number of candidates that want to integrate the department. Other ways to integrate the school exist, some students are admitted to the school after the University or after two years of specific integrated preparatory classes at the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse. Academics =Programs= The standard curriculum is the French specific three-year program in engineering that leads to the Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur degree.

Perhaps more important is another result that the authors derive from the same count of involutions, namely that up to isomorphism there are only a finite number of finite simple groups with a given centralizer of an involution. This suggested that finite simple groups could be classified by studying their centralizers of involutions, and it led to the discovery of several sporadic groups.

Drownings at Matagorda Bay A tragedy of mass drownings involving the 69th Indiana occurred at Matagorda Bay, Texas, during preparations for the invasion of Texas. The regiment was ordered to assemble at Matagorda Island on the Gulf Coast of Texas in preparation for a march north to Tyler. To move from their inland camp at Indianola on Matagorda Bay to Matagorda Island, it was necessary to cross a 300-yard stretch of the bay using a ferry made up of pontoon boats tied together in a raft. The raft could carry about three companies at a time. On Sunday afternoon, March 13, 1864, the regiment began to cross. On the raft's third trip, while carrying companies B, G, and K together with their camp followers, the raft was swamped by a swift incoming tide. Two officers and 21 enlisted men drowned, with many others carried over a mile away before they could be rescued. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 331 men during service; 3 officers and 77 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 3 officers and 248 enlisted men died of disease.

Biography Trincavelli was born and died at Venice. He began his medical studies at the University of Padua, and went afterwards to the University of Bologna, where he became so distinguished for his knowledge of the Ancient Greek, that the professors of the university would often consult him on difficult passages, and he was honoured by the name of the \\"Greek scholar.\\" After remaining seven years at Bologna, he returned to Padua to earn his medical doctorate and then to the University of Venice, where he was appointed successor to Sebastian Fuscareni in the chair of philosophy. His time was divided between his lectures, his private studies, and his practice as a physician. The latter was so extensive as to bring him annually about three thousand crowns of gold. In 1551 he was appointed successor to Johannes Baptista Montanus, in the medical professorship at Padua, and exchanged the profits of his practice for a salary of 950 crowns, which the senate afterwards increased to 1600. While being a professor there, he was the first who lectured on Hippocrates in the original language.

It is located at 1087 Main Street in the Housatonic village, in a two-story Beaux Arts building erected c. 1908. The building was a gift to the town by T. Ellis Ramsdell, fulfilling a bequest by his father Theodore, owner of the Monument Mills. It was designed by Boston architects McLean & Wright, with a sympathetic rear addition (added 1928-30) designed by the Pittsfield firm of Harding & Seaver. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The other branch of the Great Barrington library system is at 231 Main Street. Architecture and history Angle view of the library Ramsdell Public Library is located in Housatonic village, set between the Housatonic Congregational Church and the Corpus Christi Church on the north side of Main Street. The original 1908 main block is 1-1/2 stories in height, built out of yellow brick with marble trim. The main facade is three bays wide, with a projecting gabled entry pavilion at the center. The entry pavilion has marble corner quoins, and a further projection with an entablature and dentillated gable supported by pilasters and Ionic columns. The entrance has glass-paneled double doors, set in a recess framed by marble trim and topped by a sill with a foliated cartouche, and a half-round transom window. Windows on the ground floor are set in rectangular openings with splayed keystoned lintels; there are small windows beneath the eaves that illuminate the rooms of the half-story. The interior begins with a tiled entry area, with stairs rising around the outer walls to a large meeting room that occupies most of the upper story. The entry opens into a central rotunda, with reading rooms on either side, and stacks and librarian area to the rear. The openings to these spaces are flanked by wooden columns finished in emulation of marble. Walls are plastered, with oak trim around the windows, doors, and fireplaces. The rear addition nearly doubles the space of the building, extending behind the central and western portions of the main block. It provides for an enlarged reference area, more stacks, and a dedicated workroom for the library staff. The building was designed by the Boston partnership of McLean & Wright, which apparently later adapted this design for the Shedd- Porter Memorial Library in Alstead, New Hampshire, and the Weeks Memorial Library in Lancaster, New Hampshire, both of which post-date this building by a few years. It is a particularly fine local example of Classical Revival architecture.

While most alcohol sales are controlled by the three- tier system, nearly all states now permit some form of direct shipping of wine from wineries to consumers. Most states require wineries to pay for a permit in order to ship to consumers in the state, resulting in a winery-dependent slate of states that it may ship to. Direct wine shipments are also typically subject to sales and/or excise taxes. Most states also limit the quantity of wine that may be purchased monthly or annually, usually in terms of the number of nine-liter cases of wine that may be shipped, though most consumers are unaffected by these limits. Shipment of wine to dry areas is illegal. In the 2005 case Granholm v. Heald, the Supreme Court ruled that states must regulate direct shipment of wines to consumers from in-state and out-of-state wineries in the same way, either allowing or banning both. Since that ruling, more states gradually began to allow direct shipment of wine from wineries to consumers. Some states also allow direct shipment of wine from out-of-state retailers to consumers.

As one of the first political organisations pioneering Indonesian nationalism in the colonial Dutch East Indies it inspired several later organisations such as the ‚ÄòNationaal Indische Party‚Äô (N.I.P.) or ‚ÄòSarekat Hindia‚Äô in 1919 and, ‚ÄòIndo Europeesch Verbond‚Äô (I.E.V.) in 1919.

Firstly, the languages being learned differ; in the United States, Spanish is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in Australia are Italian and Mandarin Chinese. Also, teaching methods tend to differ by region. Language immersion is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the United States. Europe =Foreign language education= 1995 European Commission‚Äôs White Paper \\"Teaching and learning ‚Äì Towards the learning society\\", stated that \\"upon completing initial training, everyone should be proficient in two Community foreign languages\\". The Lisbon Summit of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills. In fact, even in 1974, at least one foreign language was compulsory in all but two European member states: Ireland and the United Kingdom (apart from Scotland). By 1998 nearly all pupils in Europe studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being the Republic of Ireland, where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both Irish and English, but neither is considered a foreign language although a third European language is also taught. Pupils in upper secondary education learn at least two foreign languages in Belgium, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Switzerland, Greece, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia. On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, pupils have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of primary school or the start of secondary school. In Luxembourg, Norway, Italy and Malta, however, the first foreign language starts at age six, in Sweden at age seven and in Belgium at age 10. About half of the EU's primary school pupils learn a foreign language. English is the language taught most often at the lower secondary level in the EU. There, 93% of children learn English. At upper secondary level, English is even more widely taught. French is taught at lower secondary level in all EU countries except Slovenia. A total of 33% of European Union pupils learn French at this level. At upper secondary level the figure drops slightly to 28%. German is taught in nearly all EU countries. A total of 13% of pupils in the European Union learn German in lower secondary education, and 20% learn it at an upper secondary level. Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a British survey showed that only one in 10 UK workers could speak a foreign language. Less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language, for example. 80% said they could work abroad anyway, because \\"everyone speaks English.\\" In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue. Since the 1990s, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages has tried to standardize the learning of languages across Europe (one of the first results being UNIcert). =Bilingual education= In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority or regional language community use partial immersion to teach both the minority and the state language. In the 1960s and 1970s, some central and eastern European countries created a system of bilingual schools for well-performing pupils. Subjects other than languages were taught in a foreign language. In the 1990s this system was opened to all pupils in general education, although some countries still make candidates sit an entrance exam. At the same time, Belgium's French community, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland also started bilingual schooling schemes. Germany meanwhile had established some bilingual schools in the late 1960s. United States In most school systems, foreign language is taken in high school, with many schools requiring one to three years of foreign language in order to graduate. In some school systems, foreign language is also taught during middle school, and more recently, many elementary schools have been teaching foreign languages as well. However, foreign language immersion programs are growing in popularity, making it possible for elementary school children to begin serious development of a second language. In 2008 the Center for Applied Linguistics conducted an extensive survey documenting foreign language study in the United States. The most popular language is Spanish, due to the large number of recent Spanish- speaking immigrants to the United States (see Spanish in the United States). According to this survey, in 2008 88% of language programs in elementary schools taught Spanish, compared to 93% in secondary schools. Other languages taught in U.S. high schools in 2008, in descending order of frequency, were French, German, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Japanese. During the Cold War, the United States government pushed for Russian education, and some schools still maintain their Russian programs. Other languages recently gaining popularity include Arabic. The Center for Applied Linguistics also conducted a study that concluded that while the number of schools from the elementary to secondary level offering foreign language instruction are on the rise, a pitfall of the curriculum is that students are not becoming proficient in the target languages. Researchers also note that American students of foreign languages significantly underperform in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts. It has been suggested that a system where foreign language instruction is required from PK-12 should be implemented in order to fix this problem. Australia Prior to the British colonisation, there were hundreds of Aboriginal languages, taught in a traditional way. The arrival of a substantial number of Irish in the first English convict ships meant that European Australia was not ever truly monolingual. When the gold rushes of the 1850s trebled the white population, it brought many more Welsh speakers, who had their own language newspapers through to the 1870s, but the absence of language education meant that these Celtic languages never flourished. Waves of European migration after World War II brought \\"community languages,\\" sometimes with schools. However, from 1788 until modern times it was generally expected that immigrants would learn English and abandon their first language.Clyne, 1997. The wave of multicultural policies since the 1970s has softened aspects of these attitudes. In 1982 a bipartisan committee of Australian parliamentarians was appointed and identified a number of guiding principles that would support a National Policy on Languages (NPL). Its trend was towards bilingualism in all Australians, for reasons of fairness, diversity and economics. In the 1990s the Australian Languages and Literacy Policy (ALLP) was introduced, building on the NPL, with extra attention being given to the economic motivations of second language learning. A distinction became drawn between priority languages and community languages. The ten priority languages identified were Mandarin, French, German, Modern Greek, Indonesian, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Spanish and Aboriginal languages. However, Australia's federal system meant that the NPL and ALLP direction was really an overall policy from above without much engagement from the states and territories. The NALSAS strategy united Australian Government policy with that of the states and territories. It focused on four targeted languages: Mandarin, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean. This would be integrated into studies of Society and Environment, English and Arts. By 2000, the top ten languages enrolled in the final high school year were, in descending order: Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Indonesian, Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Spanish and Arabic. In 2002, only about 10% of Year 12 included at least one language other than English (LOTE) among their course choices. In 2009, Lo Bianco and Slaughter, recommended a new approach, stating that ‚ÄúWhat is needed is a universal apprenticeship in learning how to learn languages‚Äù. An apprenticeship language is a relatively easy language which is taught to overcome the limitations of monolingualism, in preparation for later mastery of a different language or languages. Reasons to use an apprenticeship language are: * To make a start when target language teachers are unavailable. * To master a whole foreign language, for motivation and effective subsequent learning. * To combat procrastination in the face of diverse priorities in Language education. * To normalize bilingualism and promote flexibility. * To model creative problem solving, ethical behaviour and global citizenship. A resource and method has been devised to implement the ALL approach by equipping generalist primary (elementary) teachers to teach the simple designed language Esperanto as a first, fluent, intercultural, foreign language. The professional body for teachers of foreign languages in Australia is the Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations. Japan Hong Kong Native Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong children commence learning English and maybe also Mandarin from age 3 when they go to kindergarten and continue until they finish their secondary education. The Hong Kong government's language policy is to produce people who are biliterate in English and Written Chinese and trilingual in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. In order to enter university in Hong Kong, students must pass both English and Chinese exams, or in the case of those who did not learn Chinese at school, due to having studied at an international school, another foreign language. United Kingdom In Key Stage 2 it is compulsory to for all primary schools to teach an ancient and modern language. In Key Stage 3 it is compulsory for all secondary schools to teach a modern language up until Key Stage 4. French, German, and Spanish are commonly taught in all schools. Arabic, Bengali, Mandarin, Greek, Gujarati, Modern Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Punjabi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu are also taught. Due to the growing dominance of the English language, language education has been noted as lacking. The government plan on transforming language learning and in 2014 introduced a richer language curriculum. Since 2014 all children must be taught compulsory languages from the age of 7. India The syllabus taught in schools highly depends on the state. Most of the states follow a 3 language policy in high schools. Three languages usually include the local language of the state and English as a first and third language and Hindi or Sanskrit as a second language (or recently some other foreign languages like French, German, Italian and in some schools, Arabic). Hindi-speaking states have recently started offering other regional languages in India as a second language. Primary and middle schools mostly only teach two languages, the local language of state and English. In medium and large cities, most private schools use English as the medium of instruction.

Relocating in Rome in 1940, Lux began making its own films around this time, with the aim of its output being \\"low risk and low budget by packaging high-quality art films with cultural content\\". Unlike the studio system current in Hollywood at the time, the company did not have its own studios, but financed, distributed, and exhibited projects which others brought to it with 'fixed-price contracts' where co- producers were liable for any budget overruns. Gualino did employ executive producers, among whom were Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti.

It stars Kalyan Ram in the lead role, alongside Sana Khan, Shaam, Saranya Mohan and Kota Srinivasa Rao. The story was written by Vakkantham Vamsi, while Mallikarjun wrote the screenplay. The film features music composed by Mani Sharma. It also marks the second collaboration between Kalyan Ram and Mallikarjun after Abhimanyu, along with the Tollywood debut of Sana Khan. The narrative revolves around a football player who unleashes his violent side when his sister goes missing. Prior to its release, the film became embroiled in a controversy regarding the title, which was registered by director Gunasekhar for a film he was going to make with Ravi Teja. The title was changed from Kathi to Kalyan Ram Kathi, following which Gunasekhar gave up the title. The film released on 12 November 2010. It was a commercial failure. Plot The film opens with the protagonist killing some men and then proceeding to get stabbed by a man who thinks he murdered his wife. The flashback unfolds, revealing the protagonist Ramakrishna to be a football player who loves his sister Haritha dearly. He is protective towards her despite of her carefree nature, something that is not liked by rest of his family members. One day, a builder approaches his father at their home to clear the land for the construction of a park. Ramakrishna peacefully convinces the builder and his henchmen to leave, and instead arrives at his house to settle the matter. The builder's goon incites him, resulting in a fight that leaves everyone wounded and Ramakrishna telling the builder the importance of family. Impressed, he visits Ramakrishna's home, and in front of everyone, apologizes and asks him to marry his daughter, and Haritha to marry his son. However, Ramakrishna loves Anjali, and the builder is enraged to find them together. He arrives at Ramakrishna's house and insults both Ramakrishna and Haritha, leading to a brawl which leaves Ramakrishna's father unconscious upon learning about Haritha's disappearance from the builder's son. Helpless, Ramakrishna starts searching for her and as days pass, he suspects a politician's son of kidnapping her, following which he proceeds to attack the politician, his goons and son, only to realize he's not involved in it. Ramakrishna is arrested and then bailed by his family members who ask him to stop searching for Haritha, leave the city and fulfill his dream of playing the nationals. At the railway station, Haritha, now a married woman, is thrown out of a train and is chased by a man named Krishna Mohan and his goons, only to be saved by Ramakrishna himself who escapes with her in a train. Haritha reveals she slapped a man who misbehaved with her, but seeing his loyalty towards her, fell for him. She didn't want to marry the builder's son and thus eloped with the man who married her but showed his true colors when her in-laws revealed revenge to be the reason of the marriage. Ramakrishna devises a plan as per which he takes Haritha back to her in-laws in Rayalaseema and wins their trust, especially that of his sister's father in law when he tells his sole mission is to kill his rival. Ramakrishna's second plan is to bring together Haritha and Krishna, which doesn't work initially but starts to, with time when Ramakrishna is joined by Anjali who turns out to be Krishna's sister. Krishna's brother returns and starts mistreating everyone including Ramakrishna, who beats him up publicly when he harasses Haritha. Realizing that Krishna is now starting to change, his father instructs Ramakrishna to kill Haritha. Upon not finding her at home, Krishna becomes worried and upon learning the truth from his father, he confronts him verbally and threatens to not spare him. The opening scene is resumed when Ramakrishna returns with a sword, tells that he killed someone and is stabbed by an enraged Krishna. He threatens everyone to not save Ramakrishna and drags the latter to the gate. However, Krishna's father's rival arrives with his henchmen. Still angry as his sons were murdered, he attacks everyone and tries to kill Krishna, but is stopped by Ramakrishna who fights off the goons. He locks Krishna's father inside a room for his safety, and proceeds to confront the rival who gets killed in an explosion. Krishna's father starts believing Ramakrishna and Krishna too died due to him, while Krishna is found to be alive and living happily with his family, that now also includes Krishna.

It is a solo adventure for one player character of level 1‚Äì10. Plot summary Maze of the Riddling Minotaur is a solo scenario meant to be played by a single player character of level 1‚Äì10, although the adventure can be adapted to group play after it has been used as a solo adventure. The character is asked by the king to search a monster-infested labyrinth to find a kidnapped princess. The results of the player character's actions are written in invisible ink, to be revealed as needed by using the special pen attached to the module. Publication history Maze of the Riddling Minotaur was written by Jeff Grubb, with a cover by Tim Truman and interior illustrations by Keith Parkinson, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder and an \\"invisible ink\\" pen attached to the folder. Its original module code was M2, but when TSR began publishing modules for the Master Set of Dungeons & Dragons, the code was reassigned to Vengeance of Alphaks. Reception Chris Hunter reviewed the module for Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. Hunter called it \\"a rescue the princess\\" scenario and noted that it is not an easy one. The labyrinth is laid out in such a way that the player has to go through most areas before reaching the goal. According to Hunter the text and diceless combat system are easy to follow and he came across only two minor mistakes. However, Hunter saw one problem with the invisible ink approach in that the size of the text box can give a hint as to the results of a choice. In addition, as in most solo adventures, player choices are quite limited.

They are Neo-Grec brownstone structures built around 1879, in two sets designed by different architects. Together they constitute one of few remaining areas of low-rise rowhouse development in a neighborhood where many such houses have been demolished in favor of high- rises. In 1984 they were recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Buildings The houses are three-story brownstones, some of which have been painted. Their raised rusticated basements all have segmental-arched windows and stoops leading to the main entrance. The stoops lead to double-doored main entrances flanked by narrow parlor windows. At the flat rooflines are galvanized iron cornices with dentils and angular brackets. There are distinctions between the western six houses (Nos. 322‚Äì332) and the eastern six (334‚Äì344), built after the first two, primarily in the door and window enframements. The main entrances of the former group have slab lintels on stylized brackets with the flanking windows having simple lip lintels and sills on corbels similar to the entrance brackets. The upper windows have sills on simpler corbels. The eastern houses have more elaborate enframements. Their main entrances are enframed with deep lintels on angular brackets. The windows are fully enframed and have more complex lintels. There have been no major changes to any of these houses. Some of the dwellings have fireplaces. At 328 East 69th, in the western row, there was the only significant addition or structural alteration to any of the houses when a garage was cut into the basement. Other houses have had doors or windows replaced. All the original cast iron railings have been removed and replaced. The row is in the central portion of the block, with more extensively modified rowhouses on either side leading to high-rises that anchor the block at the intersections. At the east end is the First Hungarian Reformed Church of New York, designed by Emery Roth and also listed on the Register. The adjacent house is owned by the church and serves as its parsonage. On the north side of the street are higher, more modern apartment buildings. The area as a whole is high-density urban mixed use development typical of Manhattan. Talent Unlimited High School is to the south on East 68th Street. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medical School two blocks to the southeast. History The Upper East Side had been gradually developing as the economy recovered from the Panic of 1873. In 1878, a housing boom began with the completion of the Third Avenue El, putting the neighborhood within easy commuting distance of Midtown and Lower Manhattan where most businesses were. The blocks to the east of Third were very quickly developed with speculative rows, which sold quickly. At that time most were built in the Neo-Grec architectural style. Using forms and scale similar to the Italianate styles popular before and during the Civil War two decades earlier, the Neo-Grec differs in its detailing. Buildings in that style used angular, more geometric forms for their ornamentation, as opposed to the curvilinear forms preferred on Italianate buildings. These reflect the use of early stonecutting machines, which could not yet duplicate the latter. The buildings in the western half, Nos. 322‚Äì332, were built first. Architect Jacob Valentine designed them for builder James E. Ray in 1879. Among the many Neo- Grec rowhouses Valentine built in the area at the time, there are few survivors other than these. Ray hired William J. Smith for the eastern buildings, begun later in 1879 and completed the following year. There have been few changes to the exteriors of the buildings. The original cast iron railings on the stoops were replaced some time after 1945, when a photograph shows them all in place. In 1966, the basement of 328 East 69th was converted into a garage. The houses themselves have remained as newer high-rises have displaced most of the other rowhouses built in the early years of the Upper East Side, a rare surviving group of buildings from that era. But there has been substantial renovation of building interiors; for example, 342 East 69th Street has had new windows, plumbing, electricity, roof, floor boards, and cooling systems. The buildings have had huge price appreciation in the last few decades. For example, building 342 was valued at $1.1 million in 1990; in 2004 it was valued at $2.9 million; by December 2010, it was valued at $4.7 million.

Replication timing refers to the order in which segments of DNA along the length of a chromosome are duplicated. DNA replication Figure 2: Replication proceeds via the nearly synchronous firing of clusters of replication origins that replicate segments of chromosomal DNA (‚ÄúReplication domains‚Äù) at defined time periods during S phase. Figure 3:Animated sequence of replication. In eukaryotic cells (cells that package their DNA within a nucleus), chromosomes consist of very long linear double- stranded DNA molecules. During the S-phase of each cell cycle (Figure 1), all of the DNA in a cell is duplicated in order to provide one copy to each of the daughter cells after the next cell division. The process of duplicating DNA is called DNA replication, and it takes place by first unwinding the duplex DNA molecule, starting at many locations called DNA replication origins, followed by an unzipping process that unwinds the DNA as it is being copied. However, replication does not start at all the different origins at once. Rather, there is a defined temporal order in which these origins fire. Frequently a few adjacent origins open up to duplicate a segment of a chromosome, followed some time later by another group of origins opening up in an adjacent segment. Replication does not necessarily start at exactly the same origin sites every time, but the segments appear to replicate in the same temporal sequence regardless of exactly where within each segment replication starts. Figure 2 shows a cartoon of how this is generally envisioned to occur, while Figure 3 shows an animation of when different segments replicate in one type of human cell. Replication timing profiles Figure 4: A diagrammatic representation of replication timing in a 70-Mb segment of human chromosome 2. The red horizontal line represents time in S-phase, from early (top) to late (bottom). Grey data points each represent a different DNA sequence position along the length of chromosome 2 as indicated on the x axis, with more positive values on the y-axis indicating earlier replication. A smoothed line (blue) is drawn through the data to visualize the domains of different replication timing. Red bands at the top of the image show DNA that has been replicated at the given time in S-phase. The temporal order of replication of all the segments in the genome, called its replication-timing program, can now be easily measured in two different ways.Gilbert DM (2010) Evaluating genome-scale approaches to eukaryotic DNA replication. Nat Rev Genet 11: 673-684. One way simply measures the amount of the different DNA sequences along the length of the chromosome per cell. Sequences that duplicate first, long before cell division, will be more abundant in each cell than the sequences that replicate last just prior to cell division. The other way is to label newly synthesized DNA with chemically tagged nucleotides that become incorporated into the strands as they are synthesized, and then catch cells at different times during the duplication process and purify the DNA synthesized at each of these times using the chemical tag. In either case, we can measure the amount of the different DNA sequences along the length of the chromosome either directly using a machine that reads how much of each sequence is present or indirectly using a process called microarray hybridization. In any case, the temporal order of replication along the length of each chromosome can be plotted in graphical form to produce a \\"replication timing profile\\". Figure 4 shows an example of such a profile across 70,000,000 base pairs of human Chromosome 2.Ryba T, Battaglia D, Pope BD, Hiratani I, Gilbert DM (2011) Genome-Scale Analysis of Replication Timing: from Bench to Bioinformatics. doi 10.1038/nprot.2011.328.

The Barr body is indicated by the arrow, it identifies the inactive X (Xi). At present, very little is known about either the mechanisms orchestrating the timing program or its biological significance. However, it is an intriguing cellular mechanism with links to many poorly understood features of the folding of chromosomes inside the cell nucleus. All eukaryotes have a timing program, and this program is similar in related species.Ryba T, Hiratani I, Lu J, Itoh M, Kulik M, et al.

This indicates that it is either important itself, or something important influences the program. It is unlikely that replicating DNA in a specific temporal order is necessary simply for the basic purpose of duplicating a DNA molecule. More than likely, it is related to some other chromosomal property or function. Replication timing is correlated with the expression of genes such that the genetic information being utilized in a cell is generally replicated earlier than the information that is not being used. We also know that the replication-timing program changes during development, along with changes in the expression of genes. For many decades now, it has been known that replication timing is correlated with the structure of chromosomes. For example, female mammals have two X chromosomes. One of these is genetically active, while the other is inactivated early in development. In 1960, J. H. TaylorTaylor JH (1960) Asynchronous duplication of chromosomes in cultured cells of Chinese hamster. J Biophys Biochem Cytol 7: 455-464. showed that the active and inactive X chromosomes replicate in a different pattern, with the active X replicating earlier than the inactive X, whereas all the other pairs of chromosomes replicate in the same temporal pattern. It was also noticed by Mary LyonLyon MF (1961) Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.). Nature 190: 372-373. that the inactive X took on a condensed structure in the nucleus called the Barr bodyBarr ML, Bertram EG (1949) A morphological distinction between neurones of the male and female, and the behaviour of the nucleolar satellite during accelerated nucleoprotein synthesis. Nature 163: 676. (Figure 5) at the same time during development as the genetic inactivation of the chromosome. This may not come as too much of a surprise, since the packaging of DNA with proteins and RNA into chromatin takes place immediately after the DNA is synthesized. Therefore, replication timing dictates the time of assembly of chromatin. Less intuitive is the relationship between replication timing and the three-dimensional positioning of chromatin in the nucleus. It is now well-accepted that chromatin is not randomly organized in the cell nucleus, but the positions of each chromosome domain relative to its neighboring domains is characteristic of different cell types, and after this geography is established in each newly formed cell, the chromosome domains do not move appreciably until the next cell division.Lanctot C, Cheutin T, Cremer M, Cavalli G, Cremer T (2007) Dynamic genome architecture in the nuclear space: regulation of gene expression in three dimensions. Nat Rev Genet 8: 104-115.Walter J, Schermelleh L, Cremer M, Tashiro S, Cremer T (2003) Chromosome order in HeLa cells changes during mitosis and early G1, but is stably maintained during subsequent interphase stages. J Cell Biol 160: 685-697. In all multi-cellular organisms where it has been measured, early replication takes place in the interior of the nucleus and the chromatin around the periphery is replicated later. Recently developed methods to measure the points where different parts of chromosomes touch each other are almost perfectly aligned to when they replicate. In other words, regions that are replicated early versus late are packaged in such a way as to be spatially segregated in the nucleus, with the intervening DNA containing regions of reduced origin activity.Guan Z, Hughes CM, Kosiyatrakul S, Norio P, Sen R, et al. (2009) Decreased replication origin activity in temporal transition regions. J Cell Biol 187: 623-635. One possibility is that these different compartments within the nucleus, established and maintained without the aid of membranes or physical barriers, set thresholds for the initiation of replication so that the more accessible regions are the first to replicate.Gilbert DM (2001) Nuclear position leaves its mark on replication timing. J Cell Biol 152: F11-16. Replication timing and disease Another intriguing aspect of replication timing is that the temporal order of replication is disrupted in most cancers and in many diseases.Watanabe Y, Maekawa M (2010) Spatiotemporal regulation of DNA replication in the human genome and its association with genomic instability and disease. Curr Med Chem 17: 222-233. We do not yet understand the mechanisms behind this link, but it suggests that further research may reveal replication-timing changes as useful biomarkers for such diseases. The fact that it can now be measured with relative ease indicates that we will soon have a wealth of information about where and when large changes in chromosome folding occur during development and in different diseases.

The charity brings children to the UK for recuperative holidays; many of the children are in remission from cancer or suffer from chronic conditions such as epilepsy or diabetes. CCP (UK) was founded in 1995 by Linda Walker, who began by organising local groups to host children during the summer. It soon became apparent that holidays weren't enough, and problems within Belarus were affecting lives of thousands of children and young adults with disabilities. Nowadays, the charity oversees many projects with the help of their Belarusian partners, Supporting Children Together. These include: * Funding extra carers in institutions for children and adults with disabilities * Running an independent living scheme for 5 young adults * Running a family style home for 4 children with disabilities * Coordinating an extensive training and educational programme to support children when they leave care, find foster families, get children back with their families and generally promote a positive attitude towards disability with the aim of deinstitutionalisation. * Respite care for children living with families * Supporting children with cancer by funding medicines and extra support * Supporting the hospice in Minsk and coordinating a home hospice team in Gomel region The charity's regional groups raise funds and organise recuperative holidays for children with health problems or who are in remission from cancer and those who live in contaminated parts of Belarus.

History and operations The hospital was founded in 1856 with a Roman Catholic affiliation and is a registered charity. It was founded as the \\"Hospital of St. Elizabeth\\" by the Duke of Norfolk. Originally located in Great Ormond Street, London, by the end of the 19th century it had relocated to St. John's Wood and adopted its present name. The chapel which once laid on Great Ormond Street was moved brick-by-brick to its new site at the Hospital in St John's Wood. At its founding, the hospital was entrusted to the care of the Sisters of Mercy, which would continue for many decades to come; more recently, however, the Sisters of Mercy have withdrawn from the management of the hospital, and it is now under lay control. The hospital closed temporarily in 1866 due to a lack of funds, but later reopened. The hospital was vital during the war effort of both World War I and World War II, being used by the War Office to treat injured military personnel. In 2009, it had an income of ¬£42,671,000, making it one of the 150 largest charities in the United Kingdom. Charities Direct: Top 500 Charities - Income . Charities Direct. The hospital came to media attention in late 2007 when two board members resigned in protest after a new code of ethics, issued by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, was accepted by the board. The new code \\"bars doctors from offering any service which conflicts with Catholic teaching\\" including \\"sex-change operations, providing contraception, abortion referrals and IVF treatment.\\". Later in 2008, the Cardinal ordered the resignation of the remaining board members and installed Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank as chairman. It was reported that Jacob Rees-Mogg resigned but Aida Hersham did not.  Facilities  Hospital facilities include five theatres, and en-suite bathrooms in all of the patients' rooms. It is also the home to British Athletics, which established its medical HQ at the Hospital to care for track and field athletes. HJE Official website. Retrieved 20 July 2015 The hospital employs over 600 doctors. St Andrew's Ward, a new ¬£2.1 million 10-bed stroke and medical ward, opened in July 2016, bringing the total number of beds to over 70.

She was born in Stepney, London, the daughter of a London solicitor. She studied music at the Guildhall School and later worked as a lecturer at the City of London School. She died in Tonbridge, Kent. Career She studied music at the Guildhall School in London, England and later worked as a lecturer at the City of London School. in 1895 she was giving music lectures at the City School of London. As a composer, Swepstone wrote early 20th- century orchestral music, chamber music, and songs. During the first quarter of the 20th century, she had many of her orchestral works performed by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra, the most by a single composer. Though the music is not located, 14 of Swepstone‚Äôs orchestral works were presented in a total of 24 performances, between 1899 and 1933. There are only two recorded instances of her orchestra music having been performed elsewhere; in March 1887 at Leyton (a movement from Symphony in G minor), and in February 1897 at Queen's Hall in London (Les Tenebres). At the South Place Concert Series, a weekly chamber music concert series in London, between 1887‚Äì1987, 1,121 works were performed and women composers make up for only 13 of those compositions. Swepstone‚Äôs piece, Piano Quintet in E minor, was performed a total of four times at the concert series. Swepstone‚Äôs influence is apparent in that, of all the pieces played at the series and written by women, over half were her compositions. In total, seven of her chamber music compositions were performed at the series. In addition to Piano Quintet E Minor, played four times, the following works were each performed once: Quintet D Hn & String Quartet, Quintet E-flat Pf and Wind, String Quartet Lyrical Cycle, Piano Trio D minor, Piano Trio G minor, Piano Trio A minor.

The plant is native to the west coast of North America from British Columbia to central California from the California Coast Ranges across to the Sierra Nevada. It grows in moist open habitat such as spring-fed grasslands. Description Triphysaria pusilla is an annual herb producing a hairy brownish or purple-colored, multi- branched stem up to about 20 centimeters in maximum height. Like many species in its family, it is a facultative hemiparasite on other plants, attaching to their roots via haustoria to tap nutrients and water. Its leaves are greenish, red or purple because of the anthocyanin pigments that the plants produce. They are up to 3 centimeters long and divided into a few narrow, pointed lobes. The inflorescence is a spike of minute, tubular flowers. Each flower has a beak-like yellow or purple upper lip and a wider lower lip which is divided into three tiny yellow or purple pouches. To increase the chances of cross pollination, at any point of time during the flowering season, only three flowers will have matured on each individual plant. Two of these flowers mature their anthers first while the remaining flower matures its stigma. Pollination It is hypothesized that ants are the preferred pollinator of this species.

He was considered the nation's leading expert on union democracy.Jacobs, Mobsters, Unions, and Feds: The Mafia and the American Labor Movement, 2006, p. xxv. \\"What Louis Brandeis was to the field of privacy law, Clyde Summers is to the field of union democracy,\\" wrote Widener University School of Law professor Michael J.

Early life Summers was born in Grass Range, Montana.Joseph, Black Mondays: Worst Decisions of the Supreme Court, 1987, p. 47. His parents were farmers, and the Summers family moved to Colorado; South Dakota; and Tecumseh, Nebraska, before settling in Winchester, Illinois, in 1929. His mother died that same year. Summers attended high school in Winchester, and entered the University of Illinois at the age of 16. There, he earned a Bachelor of Science in accounting in 1939 and subsequently attended the University's college of law where he graduated with a J.D. (cum laude) in 1942. While an undergraduate and law student, Summers became active in the Methodist Student Movement and became a believer in the social gospel.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 122. Career and further education Summers' brother had enlisted in the United States Army at the beginning of World War II. But Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a conscientious objector. The Illinois State Bar Association admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but denied him admission in 1942 due to his conscientious objector status.Konvitz, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, 2003, p. 224-225. In a highly controversial but important decision, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the denial of admission to the bar in In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945).Wicek, History of the Supreme Court of the United States..., 2006, p. 301-302; Kramer, The Price of Rights: The Courts, the Welfare State, and Civil Liberties, 2003, p. 125-127. Summers later was admitted to the New York State Bar Association.Walker, In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU, 1999, p. 153. He taught law at the University of Toledo from 1942 to 1945.Smith, \\"Panel Discussion: The National Labor Relations Act and Collective Bargaining,\\" in Collective Bargaining and the Law, 1986, p. 39. In the summer of 1945, although a law professor and no longer a student, he participated in the Chicago YMCA's \\"Students in Industry,\\" joined union strike picket lines, and protested discrimination against African Americans at local restaurants.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 123. While teaching at Toledo, he met and married Evelyn Wahlgren, a music teacher. They had two sons and two daughters. Summers earned a Master of Laws in 1946 and a Doctor of Science in law in 1952, both from Columbia University. He taught law at the University of Buffalo from 1949 to 1956. While at Buffalo, Summers was also employed by the United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers to teach labor law to union members, and represented union members in arbitration hearings.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 135. In the summer of 1949, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asked Summers to update the organization's 1943 report, Democracy in Trade Unions. The updated report was published in June 1952. He taught law at Yale Law School from 1956 to 1975, but left after he felt marginalized by the faculty there.Kalman, Yale Law School and the Sixties: Revolt and Reverberations, 2005, p. 128. He joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1975, where he was Jefferson B. Fordham Professor of Law. He retired in 2005 at the age of 87. Union work In the 1940s and 1950s, Summers wrote numerous \\"ground-breaking\\" articles for law reviews that discussed how labor unions were violating their members' rights and the lack of democratic procedures and due process in union constitutions and processes. His 1947 article, \\"The Right to Join a Union\\", proved to be a critical piece in the development of his legal thinking, because it advocated that union members do not merely gain the right to work on a job but gain the right to actively participate in the union's decision- making processes.Summers, Clyde W. \\"The Right to Join a Union.\\" Columbia Law Review. 47:33 (1947); Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 123-124. As the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management began holding hearings in early 1957 on organized crime's influence in labor unions, Governor of New York Averell Harriman believed a similar commission should be created to address problems in his state. Subsequently, Harriman established the Governor's Committee on Improper Labor and Management Practices and appointed Summers chair.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 133. Summers and the committee drafted legislation which eventually became the New York Labor and Management Improper Practices Act of 1958.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 134. That same year, Summers drafted a \\"bill of rights for union members\\" for the ACLU.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 140. Summers' work was critical to the drafting and passage of the Landrum‚ÄìGriffin Act in 1959. His 1952 ACLU report helped frame the legislative proposals the Senate Select Committee considered as its work came to an end.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 136. In 1957, Harvard Law School professor Archibald Cox was asked by Senator John F. Kennedy to put together a panel of experts to draft labor law reform legislation that would address the issues raised by the Select Committee.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 138. The draft legislation which Summers helped write was the foundation of the 1958 Kennedy-Ives Bill, which itself was incorporated into the Landrum‚ÄìGriffin Act. The New York legislation Summers helped write became the basis for Title V of the Act. His testimony before the Senate \\"played a pivotal role in the Senate's narrow vote, during the next session of Congress, to add a Union Members' Bill of Rights to the bill...\\"Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 139. Beginning in 1969, Summers served on the board of directors of the Association for Union Democracy (AUD), a position he would not leave for almost four decades.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 144. He was also a member of the AUD Legal Review Committee, which helped decide which lawsuits the organization would participate in. Summers deeply influenced Supreme Court decisions several times. He submitted the AUD's brief in Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1 (1973), in which the Supreme Court interpreted the Landrum‚ÄìGriffin Act to permit the awarding of attorney's fees to successful plaintiffs. His arguments \\"and the legitimacy his presence in the case lent to those arguments no doubt influenced the outcome of this case...\\"Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 144-145. He participated in two landmark Landrum‚ÄìGriffin decisions of the US Supreme Court, Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528 (1972) (which upheld the right of union members to intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the United States Department of Labor) and Dunlop v. Bachowski, 421 U.S. 560 (1975) (which upheld the authority of federal courts to review the Department of Labor's decision to proceed or not proceed with prosecutions under Landrum‚ÄìGriffin).Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 144-146. Indeed, he wrote most of the legal brief in Trbovich. Due to his work with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), he later was asked to draft new constitutions for many UMWA locals as well as the international union.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 146-147. He also testified in a federal RICO prosecution against Teamsters Local 506, a favorable decision which eventually led to the establishment of federal trusteeship over the entire international union in 1989. Summers' theory of union democracy was that transparency and democracy make it very unlikely that organized crime will gain a foothold in a union, or that union leaders will act against their members' best interests.Jacobs, Mobsters, Unions, and Feds: The Mafia and the American Labor Movement, 2006, p. xiii. His 1960 casebook, Labor Relations and the Law, is considered a labor law \\"classic\\".Finkin, \\"Labor Law Scholarship: A Critical Survey,\\" in Research Frontiers in Industrial Relations and Human Resources, 1992, p. 527. His 1998 casebook, Labor Law, Cases and Materials, \\"is one of the few casebooks to provide a thorough discussion of union democracy.\\" His most influential later work was the article \\"Democracy in a One-Party State: Perspectives from Landrum‚ÄìGriffin,\\" published in 1984.Summers, Clyde W. \\"Democracy in a One- Party State: Perspectives from Landrum‚ÄìGriffin\\" Maryland Law Review. 43:93 (1984); the assessment of the importance of this article is from Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 148. Death Summers died at a retirement home in Germantown, Pennsylvania, on October 30, 2010, from complications of a stroke. He was survived by his wife, his two daughters, and his two sons.

Also, the appointment of a CGO with clout is both a signal to the market that the company takes corporate governance seriously and a way to increase the market value of a firm if, as research by McKinsey shows, investors will pay a premium for the stock of well-governed companies.Coombes, P & Watson, M. (2000). Three surveys on corporate governance. McKinsey Quarterly, Dec. As corporations add the necessary functions, several issues arise. First is the risk that the functions overlap, evolve into silos, create misunderstanding internally and externally and act at cross purposes. Second is the opportunity for enhanced impact through synergy between these functions. Risk managers, compliance officers and business performance managers often need to manage change in order to achieve their objectives. Without a sponsor at top management level their efforts may fail when the magnitude of resistance to change overwhelms their limited powers of influence. Third, the serial introduction of new processes may simply require more attention, time and enthusiasm than line managers can realistically offer.Kotter, J. (2005). Leading change. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press. A single phased plan for enabling good governance could mitigate the risks and preempt any wasteful expenditure.

Established as a subsidiary of the John J. Craig Company in 1914, the facility's marble products were used in the construction of numerous monumental buildings across the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. Although Candoro closed in 1982, independent marble fabricators continued using the facility until the early 21st century, when it was purchased by the preservation group, South Knox Heritage. In 1996, several of the facility's buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places. By the beginning of the 20th century, East Tennessee had become one of the nation's major suppliers of finished marble. The John J. Craig Company, which operated several quarries in the vicinity of Knoxville, was one of the region's top marble suppliers during this period. John J. Craig III, grandson of the company's founder, and three co-investors-- F.C. Anderson, W.J. Donaldson, and S.A. Rodgers-- established Candoro to cut and polish the company's quarried and imported marble. The name \\"Candoro\\" is a combination of the first letters of each cofounder's last name. The company's showroom and garage, completed in 1923, was designed by noted Knoxville architect Charles I. Barber (1887-1962). Location The Candoro Marble Works is located in South Knoxville's Vestal community along Candora Road, spanning most of the north side of the road between its Maryville Pike (State Route 33) and Spruce Road intersections. The showroom is the easternmost building, lying adjacent to Maryville Pike, and is connected to Candora Road by an oft-photographed tree-lined all√©e. The large cutting facility lies to the west of the showroom and garage, and the finishing building lies immediately west of the cutting facility. A smaller building housing the boilers and company offices stands in front of the finishing building. A marble scrap yard lies across the street from the cutting facility. Behind the scrap yard lies one of the so-called Witherspoon sites, where radioactive materials from the K-25 plant in Oak Ridge were recycled in the 1960s and 1970s. The Witherspoon sites were at the heart an environmental controversy in the 1980s that led to a multimillion- dollar cleanup effort by the Department of Energy.History of the Witherspoon Problem. 31 May 2002.

History Showroom interior, showing pink marble walls and marble tile floor In the years after the Civil War, East Tennessee experienced a quarrying boom that focused on a type of pinkish Holston Formation limestone known as \\"East Tennessee marble.\\" By 1900, nearly a dozen companies were operating quarries or finishing facilities in and around Knoxville, giving the city the nickname, \\"The Marble City.\\"\\"Ask Doc Knox,\\" \\"What's With All This 'Marble City' Business?\\" Metro Pulse 10 May 2010. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. The John J. Craig Company, one of the most successful of these companies, operated quarries near Friendsville in Blount County and near Concord in Knox County. To convert his company's quarried marble into finished products, John J. Craig III established a subsidiary, the Candoro Marble Company, which built the Candoro Marble Works complex. The site in South Knoxville was chosen for its proximity to both the railroad and Goose Creek, the latter of which provided water for the complex's steam boiler, which powered the complex's massive cutting machinery in the years before cheap electricity was available. While the company initially used its own locally quarried stone, it gradually began to rely more and more on marble imported from Europe and South America. Cutting facility, built 1914 In 1927, Candoro hired Carrara, Italy-born stone carver Albert Milani (1892-1972) as its chief carver.Jimmy Milani, Life History of Alberto Palamede (Albert) Milani. Retrieved: 12 November 2010. During Milani's 40-year tenure, Candoro provided marble for buildings such as the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, as well as local buildings such as the Knoxville Post Office building. Notable hand-carvings by Milani include the History of the World relief at the Pennsylvania State Capitol and the four eagle sculptures flanking the entrances of the Knoxville Post Office. Milani's carvings were shipped to customers as far away as Pakistan and Japan. The use of marble in building construction declined after World War II, and Candoro shut down operations in 1982. Independent marble fabricators used the company's facilities until the early 21st century, when a group of historic preservationists purchased the Candoro office building for preservation purposes and made the space available to the South Knoxville Arts and Heritage Center (later known as the Candoro Arts and Heritage Center).Knox County, Tennessee Register of Deeds Instrument No. 200301080059880 The South Knox Arts and Heritage Center initiated efforts to restore the Candoro office and showroom.

In 2005, the complex's showroom and garage were relisted to include architecture in their area of importance. The complex's four water towers are listed as contributing structures, and a now- vacant marble yard behind the showroom is listed as a contributing site. =Showroom and garage= The Candoro Marble Works showroom is a two-story building with a marble veneer exterior completed in 1923. Architect Charles I. Barber of the firm Barber & McMurry designed the building primarily in the Beaux-Arts style, and Albert Milani executed the marble detailing. The building's facade features a hand-carved cartouche and floral motif and a wrought-iron door crafted by Philadelphia master blacksmith Samuel Yellin (1885-1940). The showroom's interior includes an entrance hall with polished travertine and frescoed plaster walls and a hand-carved marble rosette. Adjacent to the entrance hall is a room with East Tennessee pink marble walls. The building's floor consists of black-and-white marble tile. A second-story penthouse sits atop the showroom building. Garage The garage, also designed by Barber, consists of four arched bays separated by four marble Tuscan columns carved by Milani. The lower half of the garage's exterior consists of the same marble veneer as the showroom, while the upper half is covered with stucco. The roof of the garage is covered with Roman tiles. A non-structural wall connects the showroom and garage. =Other contributing buildings= *The cutting facility, built in 1914, is a large steel-frame warehouse-style building. *The polishing and shipping/receiving building, built in 1914, is a concrete-and-steel structure with angular roofs covering each individual bay. This building once housed the complex's polishing machinery and shipping bay. *The boiler room and office, constructed in 1914, consists of a one-story front section that contained the complex's offices and a two-story back section that contained the complex's boiler. The interior of the office section contains East Tennessee marble floors, wainscoting, and railing.

A small portion of the forest extends into neighboring Carlton County. The eastern perimeter of the forest borders the state of Wisconsin. It is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Gray wolves, white-tailed deer, and eagles are present in the forest. Geography & history The topography of the forest varies from rolling upland sites to extensive swamps in the southern and northeastern portion of the forest. The forest is divided between two watersheds: the Willow River and Lower Tamarack River along with the southern two-thirds of the forest, eventually feed into the St. Croix River, whereas, the numerous streams in the northern one-third portion of the forest lead to Lake Superior. The area's old-growth forest was logged throughout the nineteenth century, with the Willow, Tamarack, and Nemadji Rivers being used to drive logs down the St. Croix to sawmills in Stillwater. The majority of the forest came under the ownership of the state after tax forfeitures in the early 1900s. Recreation Popular outdoor recreational activities are hunting, fishing and boating on lakes, birdwatching, and dispersed camping. Trails are well-developed and extensive in the forest: trails are designated for hiking and cross-country skiing in the wintertime, for horseback riding, with designated for both Class I and II all-terrain vehicle and off-highway motorcycling use. Additionally, a segment of the Willard Munger State Trail, known as the \\"boundary segment\\" for its location near the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, traverses the forest.

The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range. The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare. However, the project was subject to significant delays due to cost overruns and contract re-negotiations. This was partly due to difficulties combining refurbished Nimrod MR2 fuselages, which had not been built to a common standard, with newly built wings. The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years, while costs continued to climb. The MRA4 was ultimately cancelled in 2010 as a result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, at which point it was ¬£789 million over-budget and over nine years late. No direct replacement was under development at that stage, with the roles intended for the MRA4 filled by existing assets such as the Type 23 Frigate and the Merlin helicopter. However the UK announced its intention to order nine P-8 Poseidon ASW aircraft as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 at a cost of ¬£3 billion. The first Poseidon MRA Mk. 1 was delivered to the RAF in October 2019 and arrived in the UK in early 2020. Development =Origins= In 1990 the UK abandoned options for avionics, sensors and tactical system upgrades of the MR2. In 1993 the RAF issued a request for information for a Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft (RMPA) procurement programme, also known as Staff Requirement (Air) 420, which was intended to replace their fleet of Nimrod MR2 aircraft. In response to the requirement, several different companies soon submitted their bids to meet the outlined demands. British Aerospace (BAe), which had studied prospective options to replace the Nimrod MR2 since 1986, including a variant of the Airbus A310 and other civil conversion projects, ultimately settled on a proposal that involved an extensive rebuild of existing Nimrod MR2s marketed under the name Nimrod 2000. As well as operational performance, the key criteria were cost and a short procurement timescale; these \\"ruled out a new design or adaption of an existing civil aircraft. BAe evaluated several different engines to power the Nimrod 2000, such as the Rolls-Royce Tay turbofan, the Pratt & Whitney JT8D-200 turbofan, and the General Electric CF34 turbofan,\\"GE improves CF34 bid for Nimrod 2000.\\" Flight International, 17 April 1996. before settling upon the Rolls-Royce BR710 engine. In 1995, it was claimed that the Nimrod MR2 airframes were of a sufficient condition in that they could readily serve through the intended 25-year service life and that \\"retained airframe items are low risk\\". According to BAe, the Nimrod's airframe represented \\"probably the best understood airframe in the RAF inventory\\". Amongst various other bids submitted were Lockheed Corporation, which marketed its P-3 Orion as the Orion 2000, Loral Corporation proposed to rebuild ex-US Navy Orions, and Dassault which sought to develop the improved Atlantique 3.Barrie, Douglas and Graham Warwick. \\"Something old, something new, something borrowed...\\" Flight International, 15 May 1996.Barrie, Douglas. \\"Re-engineing RAF Nimrods powers BAe's RMPA bid.\\" Flight International, 29 November 1995. On 12 January 1996, Dassault announced that they had withdrawn their Atlantique 3 following discussions with the MOD; Whitehall sources stated that Dassault had found \\"...no value in pursuing its tender\\", and that the RAF had an expressed preference for a four-engine aircraft.\\"Dassault abandons RAF bid.\\" Flight International, 31 January 1996. In March 1996, BAe promoted the option of establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod aircraft as an alternative to the refurbishment of existing airframes, which was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft.Barrie, Douglas. \\"BAe offers to build new Nimrod 2000s for RAF.\\" Flight International, 27 March 1996. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000. In June 1996, BAe announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type.\\"BAe teams up with MDC for Nimrod relaunch plans.\\" Flight International, 12 June 1996. BAe argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market. As part of Lockheed's submission, the firm offered a formal guarantee of a 20 per cent workshare on all future export sales of its Orion 2000 while simultaneously lobbying for the United States Navy to also procure the type.\\"RMPA contenders step up campaign.\\" Flight International, 1 May 1996. Loral stated that it believed that its bid to refurbish stored P-3s was the most cost-effective submission; however, there was public controversy over whether Loral possessed the necessary technical information on the airframe, claims which Loral refuted. In early 1996, Loral's defense assets were acquired by Lockheed, leaving just the latter and British Aerospace in the competition by mid-1996. In May 1996, it was reported that bidders were considering self-funding their own early development costs in order to compensate for alleged funding shortfalls within the MoD's procurement budget; it was claimed that these funding shortfalls were due to differences between the original specification, which had envisioned as an off-the-shelf procurement without much in terms of development, and the increasingly extensive nature that the programme had progressively taken on.Barrie, Douglas. \\"UK monetary constraints force RPMA cost rethink.\\" Flight International, 15 May 1996. =Selection= In June 1996, the MoD's Equipment Approvals Committee recommended that the Nimrod 2000 bid be selected to meet the RAF's requirement.\\"Nimrod 2000 wins UK MoD approval.\\" Flight International, 26 June 1996. In July 1996, in response to the committee's decision, Lockheed Martin announced that it had reduced the cost of its Orion 2000 submission by 15 per cent amid a series of last-minute discussions held between Lockheed Martin President Norman R. Augustine, General Electric Company President Lord Weinstock, Secretary of State for Defence Michael Portillo and Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, seeking a 90-day interval to fully revise their bid.\\"Augustine bids for RAF RMPA reprieve.\\" Flight International, 10 July 1996. In July 1996, it was announced that the ¬£2 billion contract had been awarded to British Aerospace to produce the Nimrod 2000. By the time of formal contract award in December the aircraft had received the designation Nimrod MRA4. The Nimrod MRA4 was to be produced as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes were involved in the remanufacturing process, including the installation of BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing with 23% greater surface area, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage.\\"Reborn in an old skin.\\" Flight International, 23 July 2002. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The larger wing increased fuel capacity by 30% which, combined with efficient modern engines, allowed for unrefuelled endurance in excess of 14 hours. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from that used on Airbus A320/A340 airliners. BAe also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737. According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4's systems would enable the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more technical and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; with the ability to have swept an area the size of the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.\\"Milestone achieved in Nimrod MRA4 Synthetic Training Requirement.\\" asd-network.com.

Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, which resulted in the project being put on hold while another wing design was developed. In December 2002, BAE Systems issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the Nimrod MRA4 and the Astute class submarine projects. On 19 February 2003, BAE took a charge of ¬£500 million against the MRA4 contract. The company had previously taken a ¬£300 million \\"loss charge\\" in 2000, which was expected to cover \\"all the costs of completion of the current contract\\". The contract was renegotiated for the second time in 2002, where the aircraft requirement was reduced from 21 to 18. Nimrod MRA4 at the Farnborough Airshow Announcing plans for the future of the British military on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice.Ripley, Time.\\"RAF 'super-base' plan leaves future of Kinloss in doubt\\". scotsman.com, 6 September 2004. PA01, the first development MRA4, completed its maiden flight on 26 August 2004.

Retrieved: 20 October 2010. On 24 November 2010, 382 sub-contract workers previously working on the MRA4 were laid off at BAE Systems Warton and Woodford. After the airframes were stripped of electronic equipment, the remaining fuselages were scrapped at BAE Systems Woodford beginning on 26 January 2011. Although the process was conducted behind screens intended to hide the process from the media, the BBC flew a helicopter over Woodford and broadcast footage of the scrapping in progress. Although late and over-budget the decision to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It has been reported that following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010Cook, James. \\"Final air miles for 'spy in the sky' crews.\\" BBC, 26 March 2010. Retrieved 20 October 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked because of the lack of suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland. The aircraft would also have been used in the civilian search and rescue role; the Nimrod MR2 had often been used in this role. In this respect the Strategic Defence and Security Review stated that the UK \\"will depend on other maritime assets to contribute to the tasks previously planned for [the Nimrod MRA4]\\". Nimrod airframes being broken up for scrap in January 2011 Following the cancellation, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox used the Nimrod MRA4 procurement as an example of the worst of MOD procurement performance: \\"The idea that we ever allow ourselves into a position where something that was originally Nimrod 2000 ‚Äì where we ordered [21] was reduced to nine, spent ¬£3.8bn and we still weren't close to getting the capability ‚Äì is not to happen again.\\" Nevertheless, six ex-defence chiefs publicly criticised the decision to scrap the Nimrods in January 2011 and the Public Accounts Committee concluded in February 2012 that the decision had been made without a proper understanding of the cost implications and had wasted ¬£3.4bn. In January 2011 it was reported by the Financial Times that when the decision was taken to scrap the aircraft, \\"[The MRA4] was still riddled with flaws.... Safety tests conducted [in 2010] found there were still 'several hundred design non-compliances' with the aircraft. It was unclear, for example, whether its bomb bay doors functioned properly, whether its landing gear worked and, most worryingly, whether its fuel pipe was safe.\\" According to Air Forces Monthly magazine, \\"significant aerodynamic issues and associated flying control concerns in certain regimes of flight meant that it was grounded at the time of cancellation and may not have been signed over as safe by the Military Aviation Authority.\\" The magazine also stated that the reason for the cancellation was that the RAF and Navy placed a higher priority on fast jets and frigates than on maritime patrol. =Replacement= Reports in mid-2011 suggested that a purchase of up to five P-8 Poseidons was under consideration,\\"Nimrod U-turn blunder set to cost UK hundreds of millions.\\" Herald Scotland, 4 May 2011. while in January 2015 it was reported that attempts had been made to sell the Kawasaki P-1 as another possible replacement.Kelly, Tim and Nobuhiro Kubo. \\"Exclusive: Japan seeks to sell sub- hunting jet to UK as Abe pushes arms exports.\\" Reuters, 7 January 2015.

There he unites with his old friend Bing who lives with two women in an abandoned home in the Sunset Park neighborhood in Brooklyn. Through several situations of coincidence and self-discovery, it is a story about how to reconnect with a world once left behind, and how to rejoin the human race after self-inflicted exile. Reception The novel was well-regarded upon publication. In The New York Times Book Review, novelist Malena Watrous wrote, \\"[Auster is] right that the rules of fiction should be bent. Writers not always determined to please the reader are the ones who break new ground. Auster‚Äôs renegade impulse has set him apart, earning him devoted fans. He has also been taken to task for following his own formula too often. In 'Sunset Park,' he deviates from it by telling a fairly linear story, although there are still lengthy passages in which he interrupts the narrative by pasting in baseball trivia, a treatise on behalf of the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo and quotations from the classic movie 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' Yet if Auster can‚Äôt escape his own fixations ‚Äî if his characters still mourn the passing moment even as they live in it, still yearn to hold on to the present even as it slips away ‚Äî maybe that‚Äôs because this nostalgia is one universal human desire, made manifest in every photograph and every novel and every effort to leave a mark.\\"Malena Watrous, \\"Learned Lolita,\\" The New York Times Book Review, December 12, 2010.

Born in Tralee, County Kerry in 1952, he is the second of ten children of James, an insurance broker, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Talbot). Gerald was educated at Catholic primary schools in Tralee and Castlemaine, where the family moved about 1961. He attended the Catholic St. Brendan's College, Killarney, before going to University College Cork, where he graduated with a BA in history, English, and geography in 1972. He taught at second level under the Limerick City Vocational Education Committee, and for short spells on secondment in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (1983‚Äì85) and Madrid, Spain (1991). O'Carroll retired from teaching in 1997 to concentrate on research and publication. All of O'Carroll's published works draw their inspiration from the history of southwest Ireland, particularly County Kerry, with particular emphasis on the 12th century Norman settlement and the later Elizabethan and seventeenth- century settlements. These interests informed his first book, the writings of Mr. Justice Robert Day, a Kerry native and Dublin-based member of the court of King's Bench. He next undertook the writing of a history of Tralee. Recognising the need for such a publication, he made contact with Sir Anthony Denny, who was descended from the leading Elizabethan planter of the region, who placed important archive material at his disposal. The resulting book revealed the restrictive town charter of pre-democratic days, but assessed the positive contributions of settler representatives- Blennerhassett, Rowan and Denny included. O'Carroll's book on the Geraldine earls of Desmond, published in 2013, was the culmination of over thirty years of interest in the subject. Like his previous books, it drew its inspiration from the fact of historical continuity: despite war, including the occasional massacre in Elizabethan and Cromwellian times, by the nineteenth century the blood of the Geraldine earls was running in the veins of some of the settler families who composed the regional elite. This awareness had been forgotten by historians working within the confines of recent nationalism. O'Carroll lives in Limerick.

Jamaican stamps were valid until 19 February 1901. First stamps The first stamps of the Caymans were issued in November 1900. They were two Key Plate designs depicting Queen Victoria, with values of 1/2d and 1d. These were used for little over a year before being superseded by the same design, but with Edward VII. Shortages of stamps occurred in 1907, and overprints were produced in both Kingston and by handstamping at Georgetown. Additional shortages in 1908 resulted in the use of manuscript frankings for short periods in May and October. At the end of 1907, a new version of the Key Plate design included the inscription \\"POSTAGE & REVENUE\\", as they were now allowed for use as revenue stamps. In 1908 a 1/4d stamp appeared, with a design consisting of the denomination in an oval frame. The Key Plate continued in use with George V in 1912, then gave way to a new design in 1921. 1938 pictorial stamp of Cayman Islands.

The Caymans' first commemorative stamps came in 1932, marking the centenary of the \\"Assembly of Justices and Vestry\\", now the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands. The set of 12 all had the same design, consisting of profiles of George V and William IV facing each other, with palm trees in between. The first pictorial series dates from 1935, and consisted of a set of 12 with five different designs. The pictorial series of 1938 also had five designs, with similar themes as those in 1935 but otherwise completely different. A 1950 pictorial set featured an older George VI and all different designs for its 13 stamps; these were reused in 1953 when Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne, and two new designs added, for 4d and 1-pound denominations. A set of two stamps issued 4 July 1959 marked the Caymans' new constitution, and on 28 November 1962 a new definitive series came out.

Construction and acquisition Knickerbocker was built as a commercial tug of the same name in 1873 by Neafie & Levy at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was rebuilt in 1904. The U.S. Navy leased Knickerbocker from her owner, the Cornell Steamboat Company of New York City, on 2 May 1917 for use during World War I and enrolled her in the Navy Coast Defense Reserve, then purchased her outright from Cornell Steamboat on 13 September 1917. She was commissioned at New York City as USS Knickerbocker (SP-479) on 22 September 1917 with Boatswain M. J. Lounsbery, USNRF, in command. Operational history Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, Knickerbocker operated on the Hudson River and in New York Harbor as a minesweeper, tug, and dispatch ship. Though Knickerbocker was ordered stricken from the Navy List on 14 March 1918 due to her poor material condition and accordingly was stricken on 16 March 1918, a scarcity of tugs resulted in her retention for harbor duty, and she was reinstated on the Navy List in April 1918. On 30 December 1918, Knickerbocker was assigned as tender to the training and guard ship and served as a dispatch ship. Disposal Knickerbocker was decommissioned on 18 February 1919 and was sold the same day to Francis J. McDonald of Ardmore, Pennsylvania.

Among the historical attempts at creating a comprehensive listing of the 36 are the Kumarapala Prabandha of Acharya Jinamandan Gani of 1435 AD, Prithviraj Raso of uncertain date, and Colonel James Tod, writing in 1829. Kumarapala Prabandha list The Kumarpal Prabandha list gives 36 clans. It starts with dynasties mentioned in the classics, Ikshvaku, Yadu, Surya and Chandra. It mentions some of the famous clans: Parmar, Chauhan, Chaulukya (Solanki), Pratihara (these four are sometimes termed Agnikula) Ratt, Chandela and Pala. It also mentions local dynasties like Shilahara, Chapotkata, Nikumbh etc. Many of the names are less known. Notably, it includes the Maurya. Kumarpal Prabandha was consulted by Tod,Some Medieval Sculptures of North Gujarat, H. A. Majmudar, Gujarat University, 1968, p. 155 he refers to it as Kumarpal Charit. Prithviraj Raso list The list given in Prithviraj Raso has most of the names given in Kumarapala Prabandha, approximately in the same order. Notably it adds Tank, and Kalachuri. Tod's list A listing of the 36 was attempted by Tod in his 1829 work Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan (volume 1). The \\"races\\" are further subdivided into 157 branches ( i.e. sakhas), and genealogical, cultural, and geographic information given for each, though some of the sakhas are extinct. The principal ones like the Ghilote having 24 sub-branches, the Tuar or Tanwar 17, the Rathor 13, the Parmara 35, the Chamhan or Chauhan 26, the Challook or Solanki 16, and the Pratihara 12. Each sakha has its Gotracharya of genealogical creed describing the characteristics, religious practices, and the locale of the clan.Sir Chirravoori Yajneswara Chintamani, \\"Indian social reform: being a collection of essays, addresses, speeches\\", page 155 As early as 1872, Tod's list was criticised in the Calcutta Review: Tod listed the Jats as one of the 36 royal races. The Persian form of the ancient term Jit is Jatt (‡§ú‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü) with short vowel and double short ‚Äòt‚Äô. Tod included \\"Raj Pali\\" on the list and described them as Aheer or Ahir.

It is a remake of the Malayalam movie Thushaaram.This movie was started after the success of Souten with the same starcast. The film was a Silver jubilee hit upon its release. Synopsis \\"INSAAF MAIN KAROONGAA\\" (meaning \\"I will deliver justice\\") became an obsessive point of directive in the mind of Captain Ravi Khanna, when his young, beautiful and loving wife committed suicide. Seema was an orphan whom Khanna fell in love with her. One night when Ravi goes out of city for one of his assignments, his wife Seema is raped and commits suicide. After the suicide takes place, he manages to trace the person and becomes vindictive and shoots the culprit point blank and surrenders to military court. At this juncture the whole scene changes. As the proceedings of the court were about to start, the news of culprit having survived gets broken to him. This makes the Captain more ferocious and gets provoked to become free, so that on an appropriate opportunity he could fulfill his urge to kill him. Ravi flees from the army force and on the way he meets his friend Khan who gives him shelter. One night Ravi and Khan decide to go to the hospital, where the culprit was convalescing from his wounds, so that they could kill him. But the Captain is not able to shoot him as some of the army officers see him and try him to capture him. Accidentally the culprit's daughter comes in the way. Ravi then takes hold of her so that he can escape from that place comfortably. The Captain then decides that he will keep Pinky with him and make it look like a kidnapping and will drive the culprit that mad that he will himself surrender to police and accept that he was the person who drove his wife to commit suicide. The rest of the story is how Ravi is able to catch the culprits and how a relation develops between Pinky and Ravi and what all problems Ravi has to face on his way to attain justice for his beloved late wife.

The present building dates from about AD 1030. Anglo- Saxon features include a tall, narrow nave and chancel, late Anglo-Saxon wall- arcading in the north west aisle and traces of a Saxon door. The building has been altered and expanded over the years but the nave and a tiny window in the north side of the chancel are original features. On the north wall of the chancel are 12th-century frescoes depicting Saint Martin on horseback, escorted by attendants, dividing his cloak and giving one half to a naked beggar. On one of the walls a number of red stars have been painted, possibly representing plague deaths in the 17th century. During the Great Fire of Wareham in 1762 the church was used as a temporary refuge for those who had lost their homes. Later the church fell into disuse but at the beginning of the 20th century a programme of restoration began and the church was rededicated on 23 November 1936. In the north aisle sits a stone tomb effigy of T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), created by his friend Eric Kennington. The church is still in use, with a regular weekly communion on Wednesdays.

In a Thanksgiving Day game between the Massillon Tigers and Akron East Ends was scheduled to determine the champion of the \\"Ohio League\\", which was the direct predecessor to the modern National Football League. During the game Massillon score the first touchdown of the game (which counted as five points at the time) and made the extra point to make the score 6‚Äì0. In the last moments of the game though, Akron scored a touchdown to make the score 6‚Äì5. Fogg, who was Akron's quarterback, had to make the extra point in order for East Ends to get a share of the title. Under the rules of the time, an extra point came on a free kick straight out from where the touchdown was scored (a rule still in place in both codes of rugby but not in American football, which abolished it upon the creation of hash marks in 1932). This made for a very difficult kick by Fogg since the touchdown was scored on a difficult angle from the goal posts and he had to deal with a crosswind blowing. Fogg missed the extra point as Massillon won the title. Coaching career Fogg began coaching football at East High School in Cleveland.http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv10/CFHSNv10n1i.pdf While at Case Tech, Fogg continued the program success created by his predecessor, Joseph Wentworth, who had won the first four football titles of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC).

Formation Guy de Lussigny started painting in 1950. At first a figurative painter, he soon followed in the footsteps of Mondrian and Malevich. A pivotal encounter with Gino Severini, a founder of the Italian Futurist movement, occurred in 1955. Severini encouraged Lussigny to pursue his chosen path in geometric abstraction. The straight line, square format and colour come to dominate Lussingy's work. In 1956, he met the painter Auguste Herbin, a meeting which turned out to be equally important. Both artists took liberties with colour theory, thereby multiplying their possibilities. The gallerist Colette Allendy organised Lussigny's first individual exhibition in Paris in 1959. Thereafter he exhibited regularly in France, throughout Europe and Japan In 1967 Lussigny settled permanently in Paris and participated in a number of salons, among them 'Grands et jeunes d'aujourd'hui', 'Salon des r√©alit√©s nouvelles' and 'Salon comparaisons'. From 1969 to 1975, he worked with Denise Ren√© in Paris and New York. 1974 marked his third important encounter, with the Italian painter Antonio Calderara. They became fast friends. Friendship with artists (\\"my colleagues\\") was a key element in his life, notably that of the German sculptor Hans Steinbrenner, the Italian sculptor Francesco Marino Di Teana and the painter Antoine de Margerie. Work Guy de Lussigny's painting, pure and precise, conjures a poetic feeling. The square becomes, for the artist, 'the most harmonious shape of human invention', while the line is 'a precise rendition of mathematical reasoning'. With these elements, Lussigny creates a pictorial language with the aim of achieving 'a kind of perfection'. In 1968, the Institut de France and the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts awarded him the Prix Dumas-Millier. His works can be found in numerous public collections and museums in Valenciennes, Montbeliard, the Fondation Calderara, Fnac, Frac Ile de France, Macon, Mondriaanhuis, Mus√©e Tavet-Delacour de Pontoise, Mus√©e Matisse du Cateu-Cambr√©sis and, especially, in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Cambrai, with 120 works from the Andr√© Le Bozec donation. With a university degree in history and an accomplished pianist, Guy de Lussigny was a cultivated person. Quotes 'Lussigny, who also drew tapestry cartoons, used pure abstraction, painting monochrome backgrounds on which float elementary geometric shapes, for the most part the square and line. Searching for balance and a subtle harmony, his works lend themselves to meditation\\", according to an analysis by the Galerie Gimpel & Muller in Paris, which mounts regular exhibitions of Lussigny. 'Working in the context of the Neoplastic movement, Guy de Lussigny developed a geometric style which he has pursued with unfailing rigour. To attain a new pictorial reality, his intuitive and empirical language makes use of colour' (Lydia Harambourg). Around Guy de Lussigny's paintings there is a mystery. It's like the murmured account of n private adventure which is almost mystical. He need only render the simplest of geometric shapes -the square- and juggle the slenderest of chromatic contrasts, to expand his pictorial works and launch them into a veritable universe where it is less a matter of seeking satisfaction in another sphere than it is to find oneself grounded in that self-same universe.' (Fr√©d√©ric Vitoux of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise). Vitoux, friend and admirer of the artist, wrote this on the occasion of his exhibition at Galerie Gimpel & Muller in 2008.

Originally based in Paris, since 1996 it has been based in the Couvent des Minimes in Grenoble. The Guardian considers it one of the best orchestras in the world.Tim Ashley, Prom 22, 'The Guardian', Tuesday 31 July 2007.  History Marc Minkowski in 2013 Founded by Marc Minkowski in 1982, the ensemble was originally based in Paris. From 1987 it gained an international reputation as one of the best Baroque and classical ensembles. It has also made successful forays into the works of Offenbach, Berlioz and Bizet. In 1992, it inaugurated the Baroque music festival at the Palace of Versailles with Armide by Gluck, then in 1993 took part in the inauguration of the Op√©ra Nouvel de Lyon with Pha√´ton by Lully. 1993 also saw it win a Gramophone Award for Best Baroque Vocal Recording for its recording of San Giovanni Battista by Stradella. On its move to Grenoble in 1996 it merged with the Ensemble instrumental de Grenoble. In 1999, the ensemble collaborated with photographer William Klein on Messiah, a film performance of Handel's celebrated oratorio with accompanying photographs and filmed images shot or assembled by director. In 2004, on the reopening of the Maison de la Culture de Grenoble (renamed MC2) Les Musiciens du Louvre set up an 'atelier de cr√©ation'. In 2005, they were the first French ensemble invited to play at the Salzburg Festival (Mitridate, re di Ponto, reprised in the Mozart complete works festival in 2006). In 2005, Marc Minkowski decided to set up the Atelier des musiciens du Louvre, a workshop aiming to increase partnership with regional artists and cultural figures and to increase public access to the orchestra's concerts via teaching and education projects, especially to the young.  Activities  Les Musiciens du Louvre-Grenoble supports the renewal of Baroque music in France and more generally the use of period instruments and period style. The projet des Musiciens du Louvre- Grenoble proposes a progressive and lyrical re-evaluation, from baroque music to modern music, and programming certain works which have been neglected for unjustifiable or obscure reasons. This project makes the ensemble one of the most evolved, inventive and original music groups in the world. It is also well known for its rediscovery of works by Handel (its contribution to the Handelian repertoire is recognised as one of the most important in the world), Henry Purcell and Jean-Philippe Rameau, as well as by Haydn and Mozart, to mention the most important. This path has naturally led to later and later repertoire, favouring 19th century French music. It has participated in projects around Berlioz (Symphonie Fantastique, Nuit d'√©t√©, Harold en Italie) and Jacques Offenbach in particular (La Belle H√©l√®ne, La Grande Duchesse de G√©rolstein), but also around Georges Bizet (Carmen and the music from L'Arl√©sienne) and Gabriel Faur√© (Musique de Th√©√¢tre). The 2008‚Äì2009 season also saw even later composers such as Wagner, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Stravinski. Opera quickly took a major role in the orchestra's repertoire right from its foundation ‚Äì they have won critical acclaim for their productions of Monteverdi ( The Coronation of Poppaea in 2000 at the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence), Gluck (Armide in 1992), Mozart (The Magic Flute at the Ruhr Triennale, The Abduction from the Seraglio at the Festival d'Aix-en- Provence, Mitridate in 2005 for their first Salzburg Festival appearance) but above all their productions of Iphig√©nie en Tauride by Gluck at the Op√©ra de Paris, Carmen by Bizet (May 2007), Die Feen by Wagner (March 2009) at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet and The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs Elys√©es. It has also toured in Eastern Europe, Asia, North America, South America and (in 2009) to Japan.

It ran both cargo and passenger services, starting with the import of French brandy from Charente. The ships were grouped under the Charente Steam-ship Company in 1871 with Thomas and James Harrison as the managers. The company ceased trading in October 2000, with all remaining all rights and privileges transferred to P&O; Nedlloyd. Early history Thomas and James Harrison moved from the family farm in Cockerham, Lancashire, to the port of Liverpool to join the thriving shipping trade. Both were apprenticed to the shipping agent Samuel Brown and Son, Thomas in 1830 and James in 1838. Thomas was made a partner in 1839 and the name of the firm was changed to George Brown and Harrison (George was Samuel‚Äôs son). James Harrison was made a partner in 1849. Closely involved with Samuel Brown, and integral to the development of the Liverpool firm, was Richard Williamson, trading out of France, who had been supplying cargoes of brandy from Charente. Four small ships were bought for the brandy trade in the late 1830s, owned under varying co-partnership arrangements between the two sides. Hyde, Francis, Shipping Enterprise and Management 1830-1939 Harrisons of Liverpool (1967) Liverpool After the death of George Brown in 1853, the business continued under the name of T and J Harrison, still concentrating on the brandy trade into Liverpool and London. Price competition led to Harrison‚Äôs withdrawal from the London market in 1863 giving impetus to the firm‚Äôs geographic expansion. By the late 1860s, the principal shareholders in the ships were Thomas and James, with smaller shares being held by another brother, Edward George Harrison, the fourth partner being Richard Pierre Williamson (the son of the elder Richard) in France. Another name also appeared then, that of the bookkeeper, John William Hughes who steadily increased his shareholding in the ships and he and his family played an important role in the development of the Harrison Line. Incorporation In 1871, the disparate holdings in individual ships by individual partners were grouped together under the name of the Charente Steam-ship Company; in this way, Charente would own the ships and they would be managed by the firm of T & J Harrison. The Harrison partners controlled Charente. With the retirement of James Harrison in 1880, and the ill health of Thomas, active control passed to a younger generation, Frederic James Harrison and John William Hughes being ‚Äúthe acknowledged leaders‚Äù. They were responsible for formalizing the relationship with Charente by constituting it as a limited company in 1884. The 512 shares of ¬£1,000 each were held by 32 individuals, being members of the Harrison, Hughes and Williamson families and their close friends. A reduction in the number of shares took place in 1908 with the ownership now being in the hands of five Harrisons, five Hughes and two Williamsons. At the time of the incorporation in 1884, the Harrison Line had 22 ships; this had risen to 30 by 1890 and 57 on the outbreak of WWI. Geographic expansion and the shipping conferences The 1860s had seen the expansion of the shipping line‚Äôs geographic operations, including the Mediterranean fruit trade, Brazil and India. In 1866 a liner service was started between Liverpool and New Orleans. A permanent wharf was built for Harrisons in Galveston and, based on the import of cotton to Lancashire, it proved a very profitable route. Harrison ships also began regular sailings to India following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The partners were closely involved with the Canal administration and John William Hughes became a director in 1905, a family involvement that continued until 1950. Harrisons were actively involved in the establishment of shipping conferences, a method of regulating the international cargo trade: it was a founder member of the Calcutta Conference in 1875, the Central Brazil Conference in 1896, and the West India, Atlantic Steamship Conference in 1904. It had also joined the South African Conference in 1902. War and depression Heavy shipping losses during World War I were more or less balanced by new additions to the fleet, particularly the 12 ships bought from the Rankin-Gilmour fleet in 1917; by 1920 Harrisons owned a record 58 ships. However, the inter-war period proved a difficult time. The Conference lines had to content with periodic price cutting from tramp steamers. Trade was depressed and the Harrison Line was hard hit in the depression years 1929-32. In 1931-31, 15 ships were laid up and in 1932 a further 10 ships were sold at break-up prices. Despite this, the Company remained profitable. With the recovery in international trade from 1933, Harrisons began to rebuild its fleet, both from new build and purchases from other lines, including four ships from Furness Withy and seven from the Leyland Line. Nevertheless, by the outbreak of WWII the fleet still stood at no more than 46 ships. Of these, 30 ships were subsequently lost during the War. Rebuilding and decline Once again, Harrisons had to rebuild its fleet. By 1949 Harrisons had added 16 Liberty and Empire type ships, and 20 motor ships were added later. In 1970 Harrisons diversified by buying three bulk carriers, Wanderer, Wayfarer and Warrior. It also joined the container revolution, entering the Caribbean Ocean Lines consortium in 1977 and purchasing a ship for the South African trade. In 1981 Harrisons were founder members of the East African consortium. The line also managed two bulk carriers registered in Hong Kong However, the Harrison Line was no longer prospering. The size of the Charente Steamship fleet began to decline and by 1987 it had only three ships, although T & J Harrison did manage other ships. The Harrison Line drew to an end in 2000, when the last of the liner trades managed by the Company ended all rights were transferred to P&O; Nedlloyd. T & J Harrison was renamed Harrison Logistics but it went into voluntary liquidation in 2002.The original Charente Steamship Company which had owned the remaining liner trades, renamed itself Charente, and specialised in charts and nautical instruments. However, its 2008 accounts referred to substantial pension liabilities and industrial claims. Administrators were appointed in 2010 and the Company was subsequently placed in liquidation.

It served the London suburb of Perivale from 1904 to 1947, when it was replaced by Perivale station on the Central line of the London Underground. History The station was opened by the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 May 1904, originally being named Perivale. It had long wooden platforms, and pagoda huts, on an embankment reached by sloping paths west of Horsenden Lane South. The steam \\"push-and-pull\\" passenger service ran to Paddington (Bishop's Road), the line was shared with freight, and express trains to Birmingham (2 hours, non-stop). Until the late 1920s, Perivale was entirely rural, despite its proximity to Ealing. A similar halt was at before it was modernised by Network SouthEast. The station closed temporarily on 1 February 1915, reopening on 29 March 1920; and on 10 July 1922 was renamed Perivale Halt. It closed permanently on 15 June 1947, in advance of the opening of the extension of the Central line from North Acton to Greenford on 30 June 1947.

The bakery chain, which consisted of approximately 40 locations in and around central Indiana, was known for its popular treats such as their Sweetheart Coffee Cake, Zebra Square Brownies and Blackout Cake. In July 1999, the factory was abruptly shut down by the Indiana State Department of Health for repeated/severe code violations. The entire chain was dissolved soon after. Despite the closure being heavily publicized by the local media, the popularity of Roselyn Bakeries' products did not wane. In 2000, the Kroger grocery chain sold a limited-edition cookbook of the bakery's recipes. (Reprints of the cookbook have since been made available at Roselyn Recipe, the bakery's official website.Roselyn Recipe, Inc.

In 2005, the Dias family, along with another partner, purchased Roselyn Recipe and the assets of Roselyn Bakery from the Clark family (the bakery's original founders). Two bakeries were established, one in St. Louis and the other in Indianapolis, to continue the production and distribution of these products.

Seabury Company at Morris Heights in the Bronx, New York, for Mr. Henry Goldman of New York City, who apparently had her built with the intention of offering her to the U.S. Navy for service. Upon her completion during the summer of 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from Goldman under a free lease for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Babette II (SP-484) on 25 July 1917. Assigned to the 5th Naval District, Babette II served as a transportation and inspection boat, carrying inspectors to and from ships anchored in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and conducting radio and ordnance inspection work. On occasion, she was also used by the special aide to the Commandant, 5th Naval District, and by the Commander, District Forces Afloat. Babette II continued on duty until about a month after the end of hostilities in World War I. On 15 December 1918, Babette II departed Hampton Roads bound for New York City, where she simultaneously was decommissioned, returned to her owner, and presumably stricken from the Navy List on 17 January 1919.

FCCBs are issued in currencies different from the issuing company's domestic currency. Corporates issue FCCBs to raise money in foreign currencies. These bonds retain all features of a convertible bond, making them very attractive to both the investors and the issuers. These bonds assume great importance for multinational corporations and in the current business scenario of globalisation, where companies are constantly dealing in foreign currencies. FCCBs are quasi-debt instruments and tradable on the stock exchange. Investors are hedge-fund arbitrators or foreign nationals. FCCBs appear on the liabilities side of the issuing company's balance sheet. Under IFRS provisions, a company must mark-to-market the amount of its outstanding bonds. The relevant provisions for FCCB accounting are International Accounting Standards: IAS 39, IAS 32 and IFRS 7. FCCB are issued by a company which can be redeemed either at maturity or at a price assured by the issuer. In case the company fails to reach the assured price, bond issuer is to get it redeemed. The price and the yield on the bond moves on the opposite direction. The higher the yield, lower is the price. Foreign currency convertible bonds are equity linked debt securities that are to be converted into equity or depository receipts after a specified period. thus a holder of FCCB has the option of either converting it into equity share at a predetermined price or exchange rate, or retaining the bonds.

These are also known as citizenship by investment, golden visa, or golden passport programs. Immigrant investor programs usually have multiple criteria that must be fulfilled for the investment to qualify, often pertaining to job creation, purchasing of real estate, non-refundable contributions or specific targeted industries. Most of these programs are structured to ensure that the investment contributes to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the country in which they wish to reside or belong to. It is more often more about making an economic contribution than just an investment.  History  A golden visa is a permanent residency visa issued to individuals who invest, often through the purchase of property, a certain sum of money into the issuing country. The roots of golden visas have been traced back to the 1980s when tax havens in the Pacific and Caribbean began \\"cash-for-passport\\" programs that facilitated visa-free travel and provided tax advantages. For example, in 1984, St Kitts and Nevis began its program which offered not only permanent residency but citizenship to foreign nationals. The issuing of golden visas expanded dramatically during the 21st century with around 25% of all countries issuing such visas as of 2015.IMF Working Paper, WP/15/93, Too Much of a Good Thing?: Prudent Management of Inflows under Economic Citizenship Programs, by Xin Xu, Ahmed El-Ashram and Judith Gold, https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp1593.pdf Statistics on the issuing of golden visas is scarce but the IMF estimated in 2015 that the vast majority of golden visas are issued to Chinese nationals. Requirements and issuing Golden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000 in Dominica up to ¬£2 million in the U.K. The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value. Golden visas have been especially popular with Chinese nationals, over 100,000 of whom acquired them during the period from 2007 to 2016. Portugal's golden visa was introduced during the Great Recession to help attract investment into the country's housing market. By 2016 the country had issued 2,788 golden visas of which 80% had gone to Chinese nationals. Some countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer citizenship (\\"so-called golden passports\\") to individuals if they invest a certain sum. Controversy The issuing of so- called \\"golden visas\\" has sparked controversy in several countries. A lack of demonstrable economic benefits and security concerns have been among the most common criticisms of golden visas. In 2014 the Canadian government suspended their golden visa program. But because of the Canada‚ÄìQu√©bec Accord relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens that allows Quebec to maintain its own immigration policy, Quebec maintains its own golden visa program. The golden visas have been criticized by members of the European Parliament for disfavoring the concept of citizenship and in 2014 the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution that an EU passport should not have a \\"price tag.\\" According to a study, the EU has won approximately ‚Ç¨25 billion over the last 10 years through foreign direct investment programs.  By country  According to Corpocrat Magazine in 2016, the countries with the top-ranked immigrant investor programs in the world were Malta, Cyprus, Portugal, Austria, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Spain, Latvia, Monaco, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Grenada, Abkhazia, Saint Lucia, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE and Dominica. However, golden visas represent only a small proportion of new passports. In 2016, 994,800 citizenship applicants were granted across the EU, according to Eurostat, with just 0.1 percent of applications made under investment schemes. Dominica implemented its program in 1993 to provide investors the opportunity to gain Dominican citizenship via a contribution to its Economic Diversification Fund or the purchase of an alternatively approved project along with a fee. The Malta Individual Investor Programme, which Henley & Partners was contracted in 2014 by the Government of Malta to design and implement, is similarly capped at 1,800 applicants. Applicants are subject to a thorough due diligence process which guarantees that only reputable applicants acquire Maltese citizenship. Moreover, applications from countries where international sanctions apply may not be accepted. Applications from a particular country can also be excluded on the basis of a Government policy decision. The minimum investment for this program is $870,000 with a non- refundable contribution of $700,000. The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program is a Canadian program which allows investors who intend to settle in the province of Quebec to invest money in Canada. The Quebec government said it would accept a maximum of 1,750 applications to the Immigrant Investor Program during the period of 5 to 20 January 2015. Applicants with an intermediate- advanced aptitude in French are not subject to the cap and may apply at any time. The program has been associated with the lack of housing affordability in Vancouver. The United States EB-5 visa program requires overseas applicants to invest a minimum of anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, depending on the location of the project, and requires at least 10 jobs to be either created or preserved. When these criteria are met, the applicant and their family become eligible for a green card. There is an annual cap of 10,000 applications under the EB-5 program. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has offered its EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program since 1990. It is designed to encourage foreign investment in infrastructure projects in the U.S., particularly in Targeted Employment Areas (TEA), high unemployment areas. The funds are channeled through agencies called regional centers, now designated only by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The funding opportunities allow the investor to make a sound financial investment and obtain a U.S. ‚ÄúGreen Card.‚Äù One of the more successful examples of the program is the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's program through the Delaware Valley Regional Center to raise over $200 million for completion of a major project on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A large majority of users of such programs are wealthy Chinese seeking legal security and a better quality of life outside of their home country. More than three-quarters of the applicants to Canada's (since canceled) immigrant investor program were Chinese. Money laundering scandals involving banks in Malta and Latvia have made citizenship schemes more contentious by drawing attention to the lack of controls on Russian funds entering EU countries. The UK grants investor visas. As per the official statistics with the British Home Office, as many as 255 Golden Visas were granted in the first half of 2019 alone. , an individual can apply for the UK Tier 1 (Investor) visa if they wish to invest an amount of ¬£2 million or more in the UK. The applicant must be from outside Switzerland and the European Economic Area to apply for such a visa, along with various other eligibility requirements. With this class of visa, a person can go to the UK for a maximum duration of 3 years and 4 months, with the ability to apply for an extension of 2 more years. The visa holder can apply to settle after 5 years or less; the greater the investment, the shorter the waiting period. A recently emerged programme, Turkish Citizenship by Investment (TCBI) also attracts many investors. Related legislation of Turkey has been amended on 9th September 2018, therefore reducing the requested amounts for Turkish Citizenship application. Republic of Turkey, currently 19th biggest economy of the world with its almost 85 million population, mainly presents 2 option to investors: purchasing real estates for at least 250.000 USD on condition to not to sell for 3 years or depositing 500.000 USD to any active bank in Turkey (including foreign banks so long as these are active in Turkey) on condition of not withdrawing such money for a period of 3 years. Upon investing as above and submitting citizenship application duly, Turkish passport is granted mostly within 6 months.

Higginson was part of the deployment which went to Dunkirk in 1940, where he became an ace within the first six months of the war. Awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal and commissioned as a flight lieutenant, by the time he was shot down over Lille in 1941, he had reached a tally of 15 victories. After capture, escape to Vichy France, recapture, he returned to England via Monte Carlo and Spain. Returning to operations in late 1942, the air battle required that he used his knowledge in training new pilots and developing improved strategies and tactics. Early life Frederick William Higginson was the son of a policeman, born into a Welsh language-speaking family in Gorseinon, Swansea, on 17 February 1913. Educated at Gowerton Grammar School, he joined the RAF straight from school as an apprentice in 1929, aged 16. Assigned for training at RAF Halton, he was allocated service number: 44630. In 1932 he was posted as a fitter-airgunner to No 7 Bomber Squadron. RAF career =Pre-war pilot= Accepted for pilot training in 1935, on completion of training he joined the Gloster Gauntlet equipped No. 19 Squadron RAF the following year, and then quickly moved to C Flight to form No. 66 Squadron RAF. Selected to play rugby for the RAF from 1936, in 1937 he moved to the Gloster Gladiator equipped No. 56 Squadron RAF, which was then re-equipped with the brand new Hawker Hurricane monoplane fighter. =Battle of Britain= Promoted to flight sergeant in 1940 he was sent to Dunkirk, France with \\"B\\" Flight. He scored his first victories on 17 May, downing a Do 17 of KG 76 near Douai and a He 111 of KG 54 near Cambrai. After recording four victories in the Battle of France, he returned to England and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal on 27 July 1940, during the Battle of Britain. Having already destroyed at least five enemy aircraft, the citation stated: Between 12 August and 30 September, he accounted for a further nine enemy aircraft, reaching a total of at least 15 victories destroyed or damaged. On 16 August, after sustaining damage from return fire from a Dornier Do 17 that he had critically damaged, he crash-landed his Hurricane Mk I (P3547) near Whitstable. On 18 August 1940 his Hurricane was again damaged in combat off the Essex coast. One of his victories during this period was supposedly the Bf 109 of Hans Mellangrau over the Thames Estuary. Higginson recalled the fight 60 years later, when the pair met up at a Battle of Britain memorial event: =Shot down= On 17 June 1941, as part of the close escort for No.2 Group light bombers raiding Lille, Higginson was shot down. The cause was never established, (anti-aircraft fire or enemy fighters) although Bf 109's of JG 26 claimed 11 Hurricanes of both No.56 and No.242 Squadrons (7 were actually lost).\\"JG 26 War Diary Vol. 1\\" Caldwell, page 136 In the resulting explosion Higginson's control column snapped at the base, his left boot was torn off and his trousers were shredded. Higginson landed in a wood northwest of Fauquembergues, where he was quickly rounded up by a German Army officer and sergeant who arrived on a motorcycle and sidecar combination. Placed in the sidecar, while his captors were distracted by a low-flying Me109, Higginson managed to crash the motorcycle and sidecar into a ditch, and ran off. Hiding that night in a wood, Higginson made his way to an occupied hut, where he gained clothes and some cash from the owner. Waking into Fauquembergues, he ordered a beer in his limited French. Hitching a lift with a lorry driver, he was taken to a local garage whose owner had contacts with an escape line for Allied airmen. Introduced to British Army Captain Harold \\"Paul\\" Cole, a fellow survivor of the Battle of Dunkirk and local co-ordinator of the underground escape route, Cole took him to local priest Abb√© Carpentier in Abbeville, who provided Higginson with false identity papers. Higginson then travelled to Paris, where he lodged in a brothel until July 1941. To allow Higginson to exit via Vichy France to Spain, Cole escorted him on a train journey via Tours and St Martin-le-Beau, where at the station they were questioned by German officers. Not convinced by the story that Higginson was an idiot seeking work, on searching his valise they were unable to find further evidence as its contents were smothered by chocolate which had melted in the summer heat. They also failed to find the pistol and British passports in Cole's luggage, as it was wrapped in dirty laundry. Cole left Higginson at the Marseilles home of Greek doctor Georges Rodocanochi and his wife, who operated a safe house for Pat O'Leary's MI9 section. After Cole returned to northern France, Dr Rodocanochi told Higginson that he had discovered that Cole was not in fact a British Army captain, but a sergeant who had absconded with mess funds. Later, having been captured by the German's, Cole informed on Father Carpentier, who was subsequently executed. Recapture Impatient at being out of the action, Higginson caught a train to Perpignan, where with an Australian Army Corporal they persuaded a Catalan to guide them to Spain. Stopped by gendarmes and found to have false papers, Higginson struck one of them. Imprisoned for six months, he was retained in reprisal for a further period after a 5 March 1942, RAF raid on the Renault factory at Boulogne-Billancourt. Placed in Fort de la Revere above Monte Carlo on 17 March he decided to assume the name Captain Bennett as he believed the Germans disliked airmen. Return home On discovering his retention, and with the RAF short of experienced pilots, MI9 urged O'Leary to get a group of pilots including Higginson back to Britain, under the Special Operations Executive's Operation Titania. Using Polish priest Father Myrda as a go-between, O'Leary smuggled a hacksaw blade into the prison. On the night of 6 August during a noisy inmate-contrived concert in the forts courtyard, Higginson and four other pilots escaped through a coal shute, and out of the fort via an operational sewer. Reaching Cap d'Ail without his supplied ID card, Higginson reached the Scottish tea house in Monte Carlo, a safe house run by spinster Eva Trenchard. Disguised as priests and accompanied by Father Myrda, the group reached Marseilles. Now accompanied by French underground operatives to Canet Plage, due east of Perpignan, it was chosen because the two safe houses ‚Äì the Hotel du Tennis and Villa Anitawas ‚Äì could accommodate the 25 man group of agents and pilots. On 17 September the group were picked up from the beach by a dingy from the Q-ship Tarana, a Polish fishing trawler also called the Seawolf. Transferred to the SOE fast patrol boat HMS Minna, she returned to her base in Gibraltar, from where Higginson was flown home to RAF Greenock on 5 October 1942. =End of the war= To enable him to return to No. 56 Squadron RAF, Higginson retrained on the Hawker Typhoon before being attached to Napier & Son, resolving production issues on the Napier Sabre engine installed on the Hawker Typhoon. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1943, the citation stating: In mid 1944 he was posted to 83 Group Communications Squadron until 1946 when he was posted to No. 11 Group RAF, Headquarters Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory.Aces High, Shores & Williams, page 327 =Postwar career= Sent to the RAF Staff College, Bracknell in 1948, on graduation he was appointed personal staff officer to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, RAF Training Command. In 1951 he joined the staff of the Army Staff College, Camberley. Promoted wing commander from 1952, he served on the operational requirements staff, also taking a helicopter course. After the RAF In 1956 Higginson resigned from the RAF to join the newly demerged Bristol Aircraft Ltd, based in London as its military liaison officer. He played rugby for London Welsh, Richmond and Surrey until he was 40. Appointed sales and service director of the Guided Missiles Division, he was responsible for export sales of the newly developed ground-to-air missile defence system, Bloodhound. In 1963 he joined the board of Bristol Aircraft then in the New Year Honours 1964 Higginson was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to industry. Having met Kuwaiti businessman Abdullah Alireza, in 1964 he left Bristol Aircraft to launch Rezayat Services' London office, building a substantial business for the Kuwaiti's European company. Retirement After retiring in 1969 he bought Peny-Coed, a 250-acre farm estate with a large 17th-century house, in Carmarthenshire. He lived there with his wife Jenny \\"Shan\\" Jenkins, whom he had married in 1937, and his four sons. His wife predeceased him in August 2002, while Higginson died on 12 February 2003. Memorial Higginson was remembered at his old school in Swansea, with the unveiling of a plaque in November 2010.

Life Gregory, born in London on 28 December 1776, was the fifth son of Benjamin Way (1740‚Äì1808), FRS, of Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, MP for Bridport in 1765, and of his wife Elizabeth Anne (1746‚Äì1825), eldest daughter of William Cooke, provost of King's College, Cambridge. His grandfather, Lewis Way (died 1771), director of the South Sea Company, and descendant of an old west-country family, first settled in Buckinghamshire. His aunt Abigail was the wife of John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield. His brother, Lewis Way (1772‚Äì1840), was the father of the antiquary Albert Way (1805‚Äì1874). He died at Brighton on 19 February 1844, and was buried in the family vault at Denham Church, Buckinghamshire. Way married, on 19 May 1815, Marianne, daughter of John Weyland, of Woodeaton, Oxfordshire, and Woodrising, Norfolk. He had no children. Career He entered the army as an ensign in the 26th foot (Cameronians) in 1797. He was captured by French privateers when he was on his way to join his regiment in Canada, and was detained a prisoner in France for a year before he was exchanged. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 35th foot on 3 November 1799, and sailed with his regiment in the expedition under General Pigot on 28 March 1800 for the Mediterranean. Arriving at Malta in June, he took part in the siege of Valletta, which ended in the capitulation of the French on 5 September. He returned to England in 1802, and was promoted to be captain in the 35th foot on 13 August of that year. Shortly after that, he was placed on half-pay on reduction of that regiment. Way was brought in as captain of the 5th foot on 20 January 1803, and, after serving in the Channel Islands, embarked with his regiment in the expedition under Lord Cathcart for the liberation of Hanover in 1805; but the vessel in which he sailed was wrecked off the Texel, and he was taken prisoner by the Dutch. After his exchange he sailed at the end of October 1806 in the expedition under Major- general Robert Craufurd, originally destined for Chile, to Cape de Verde, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope. In accordance with orders received there, the expedition sailed for the River Plate, arriving at Montevideo in the beginning of June 1807, where it joined the force under General John Whitelocke, of which Way was appointed assistant quartermaster-general. At the storming of Buenos Ayres, Way led the right wing of the infantry brigade. He returned to England after the capitulation. Way was promoted to major in the 29th Foot on 25 February 1808. He served under Sir Brent Spencer off Cadiz, and with him joined Sir Arthur Wellesley's army, landing in Mondego Bay, Portugal, on 3 August. He took part in the Battle of Roli√ßa on 17 August, when, on gaining the plateau with a few men and officers of his regiment, he, when charged by the enemy, was rescued from the bayonet of a French grenadier by the humanity of General Brenier, and made a prisoner. He was exchanged in time to take part in the operations in Portugal when Sir Arthur Wellesley returned in April 1809. He commanded the light infantry of Brigadier-general R. Stewart's brigade, which led the advance of the British Army, and was present in the actions of the passage of the Vouga on 10 May and the heights of Grijon the following day, at the passage of the Douro and capture of Oporto on the 12th, and in the subsequent pursuit of Soult's army. At the Battle of Talavera on the night of 27 July, Way took part with his regiment, under Major-general Rowland Hill, in the gallant repulse at the point of the bayonet of the French attack of the heights on the left of the British position. He was present at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September 1810, and at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, when, on the fall of his lieutenant-colonel, he succeeded to the command of the 29th Foot during the action, for which he received the medal. He was, when charging with his regiment, shot through the body and his left arm was fractured at the shoulder-joint by a musket-shot. He was promoted to be brevet lieutenant-colonel on 30 May 1811, and on 4 July of the same year was gazetted to the command of the 29th Foot. On his return to England in 1812 with the skeleton of the 29th Regiment (about a hundred effective men), Way by considerable exertion reformed the corps, and embarked a second time for the Peninsula in 1813. In 1814, however, the effect of climate and wounds compelled him to return to England, when he was placed on the half-pay list of the 22nd Foot. For his services he was knighted the same year, and was awarded an annuity of ¬£200 for his wounds, and received permission to accept and wear the insignia of a knight commander of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword. On relinquishing the command of the 29th Foot he was presented by his brother officers with a valuable piece of plate as a memento of their esteem. In 1815, Way was made a companion of the Order of the Bath, military division, and was appointed to the staff as deputy adjutant-general in North Britain. He was promoted to be colonel in the army on 19 July 1821. On the abolition of his staff appointment in Scotland he was nominated, on 7 November 1822, colonel of the 3rd Royal Veteran Battalion, which was disbanded in 1826, when Way was placed on half-pay. He was promoted to the rank of major-general on 22 July 1830, and lieutenant-general on 23 November 1841, and was given the colonelcy of the 1st West India Regiment on 21 November 1843.

There are to date eight novels, fifty-one short stories, and fifteen poems that touch on the people and life of the place. The chronology of the tales stretches from the United States Civil War to 2008. Within these stories a reader encounters both momentous and ordinary events in the lives of the Beechum, Feltner, Coulter, and Catlett families, individuals of which, along with others, make up the Port William membership. In his essay \\"Imagination in Place,\\" Berry comments on his intentions for Port William: \\"I have made the imagined place of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, in an attempt to honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it.\\"Wendell Berry. The Way of Ignorance, Shoemaker & Hoard, 2005, 50-51 and Imagination in Place, Counterpoint, 2010, 15 The Port William Membership \\"The Membership\\" is the term by which Berry and his characters convey the bonds of a community within its given geographical location. The \\"membership\\" consists of any person who recognizes his or her place among‚Äîand responsibility for the well-being of‚Äîthe land, animals, and people of the place. In \\"The Wild Birds,\\" the character Burley Coulter explains what he means by 'membership,' :\\"The way we are, we are members of each other. All of us. Everything.

The organization focuses on the specific goal of creating a Connected and Collaborating California. The directory is meant to aid survivors, service providers and concerned citizens in joining the fight against human trafficking. The CAS website contains a page with Resources that directs the user to Awareness Materials, Trainings, Legislation, Prevention Education, Research, and Legislative Models. Philosophy The CAS charter is founded on the philosophies that every person has an inherent dignity which society and laws must uphold and protect; that human trafficking, which is by definition a crime against a person also deprives the victim of basic and fundamental human and civil rights; and that allowing any form of slavery to exist is a detriment to our society and communities; the offense reaches beyond the individual. History California Against Slavery (CAS) was founded in 2010 as a 501(c)4 human rights advocacy organization directed at strengthening California state laws to protect victims of sex trafficking, particularly minors, and to increase law enforcement efforts. The organization focused on the specific goal to put an initiative on the 2012 California ballot. California voters passed Proposition 35 (the CASE Act), a California Against Slavery citizen initiative with over 81% approval, making it the most popular initiative since Californians began the process in 1914. Ballot initiatives CAS seeks to initiate a vote on a ballot question that would (1) make stiffer criminal penalties (2) aid district attorneys in prosecuting human trafficking offenses, (3) increase protection for human trafficking victims, (4) mandate two-hour human trafficking training for law enforcement officers, and (5) increase allocation of certain seized assets and fines to organizations that serve human trafficking victims.http://www.californiaagainstslavery.org/about/initiative/http://www.ktla.com/videobeta/20077aec-1cdb-448c-9683-906283a12a49/News/KTLA- Special-Report-Teens-Sold-as-Sex-Slave CAS was unable to reach the required 600,000 signatures required before the March 31, 2010 deadline for automatic placement on the ballot. The organization is actively seeking to raise awareness and to get an initiative on the ballot in 2012. Raising awareness CAS‚Äôs efforts have been the subject of numerous news programs and news articles. In addition to media exposure, CAS raises awareness throughout California by hosting awareness events. The location of the events are popular trafficking hubs such as San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento, the state capital. The most notable event was hosted on June 28, shortly after the ballot deadline in front of the State Capital in Sacramento which included notable appearance in support of CAS including speakers Senate President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), Jenny Williamson, founder of Courage to Be You, Nola Brantley, executive director of MISSSEY, Randy Harrell, senior pastor of New City Church and performances by musicians: Coalition fight music, Freddy Wachter and Kristie White. This event brought people together to hand deliver petitions to the State Capital in furtherance of the inclusion of CAS's anti-trafficking initiative on the 2012 ballot. CAS and other anti- slavery organizations CAS‚Äôs goal is set for 2012 with efforts to propose an initiative to California‚Äôs 23 million eligible voters. CAS works alongside other organizations such as Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, Courage To Be You, Stop the Traffik, and Standing Against Global Exploitation.http://www.californiaagainstslavery.org/about/faq/ Endorsements CAS has obtained police endorsements from San Diego Police Officers Association, Southern California Alliance of Law Enforcement, National Latino Peace Officers Association, San Diego Chapter, and Peace Officers Research Association of California. http://californiaagainstslavery.org/initiative/endorsements/  See also  *Human trafficking in California  References   External links  *https://web.archive.org/web/20101128032529/http://oaklandlocal.com/article/youth- trafficking-series-index *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erQwP69Hhks (KRON Channel 4 San Francisco) *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa_Wo4hbh50&feature;=player_embedded (NBC Bay Area) *http://oaklandnorth.net/2010/03/13/as-more-oakland-youth-join-the-sex- trade-law-enforcement-explores-alternatives-to-incarceration/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20110629045029/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Flocal%2Fsan_francisco&id;=7212507 *http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=72771 Category:Organizations that combat human trafficking Category:Human trafficking in the United States Category:History of slavery in California ","title":"California Against Slavery"},{"id":"29575078","text":"Camote cue or camotecue is a popular snack food in the Philippines made from camote (sweet potato).

The above problems are more commonly associated with old age but due to many factors such as poor component design, proximity of the user to the screen and an excess of consecutive working hours mean that the above problems can feature in both young and old computer users. This is an extremely important issue as computers become more important in every corner of employment the medical effects caused by them will elevate unless sufficient research is performed and time is dedicated into eliminating and reducing these problems as much as possible. It is estimated that today at least 75% of all jobs involve some level of computer use; this means three- quarters of the workforce are being exposed to numerous health problems, the same can be said of students and educators who do not go through any day without access to a computer for academic work. The figure for people working with and using computers recreationally is to increase considerably in the coming years so it is crucially important that these problems are identified and resolved sooner rather than later in an effort to reduce if not eradicate these problems. Common computer-induced medical problems Notable physical medical problems that can arise from using computers include Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Computer Vision Syndrome, and Musculoskeletal problems. =Carpal Tunnel Syndrome= The medical problem associated with computer-related work is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints, especially the wrist, and can lead to numerous musculoskeletal problems. It has become very common among Computer professionals due to poorly placed computer components and extensive typing over a long period of time. Studies conducted show that one in eight computer professionals suffer from CTS. This study was conducted over 21 companies and the majority of sufferers said that they experienced acute and in some cases severe pain due to CTS. The main cause of CTS seems to be debatable, however, with many sources saying that the syndrome is predominantly caused by the acute positioning of the wrist while typing and this problem is exacerbated by the need for the user to be crouching towards the screen while typing. Different research conducted cites the mouse as being the main cause of CTS as it was found that among the fingers the right thumb was revealed to be more susceptible to CTS due to the acute position of the thumb while using the mouse. CTS, although prevalent, seems to be very difficult to ameliorate or cure due to the consistency in the design of computer components such as the mouse and the keyboard, but some companies are leading the way with technologies such as touch screen monitors which will reduce stress on the hand and wrist. Employers in major companies are also taking measures to ameliorate CTS by implementing frequent work breaks and work rotation procedures to ensure that employees aren‚Äôt working on a single computer for hours on end \\"a higher level of intensity of computer work results in higher risk for CTS.\\" which causes severe stress on the joints and thus can lead to CTS Cumulative trauma disorders are caused by \\"people who sit at PC workstations or visual display terminals in fast-paced, repetitive keystroke jobs. Their fingers, wrists, arms, necks, and back may become so weak and painful that they cannot work,\\"O‚ÄôBrien & Marakas, 2007, p. 553 Many people do not think about this when they look at their computer while using it. It is important to note that everything down to the keyboard has a design process behind it focusing on user interface.O‚ÄôBrien, J. & Marakas, G. (2011).Management Information System, 10e. New York, NY. McGraw-Hill Irwin. =Computer Vision Syndrome= In many cases, frequent computer users suffer from computer vision syndrome, which is a degenerative eye problem which can result in severely reduced eyesight (Myopia), blurred vision, overall eye tiredness and even Glaucoma. Computer Eye Syndrome is an umbrella term for many problems but the causes of these problems can be easily identified. When using a computer due to the size and setup of the monitor and components it is necessary for the user to be within at least two feet of the monitor when performing any type of computational work. This presents many problems especially in older monitors due to an elevated amount of monitor glare, poor display quality and insufficient picture display refresh rates. Although these problems are more evident in older computers the newer models are not free from these problems either. Studies have been conducted. They state ‚ÄúTreatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation‚Äù which shows these problems are quite easily solved with minimal investment from computer manufacturers through producing higher quality monitors with better resolution and refresh rates. The most common form of Computer Vision Syndrome is a condition termed Dry Eye, which results in itchy, sore and even the illusion that something is stuck in your eye. This condition is often caused by extensively long period looking at a computer screen. Video screens have a design process for user interface. Video screens can cause eyestrain from prolonged viewing. Cathode ray tubes are what are used to display the information on your computer. These send off radiation. This is a concern that has been taken into account when designing better computer screens for user interface. =Musculoskeletal problems= Another medical issue caused by the use of computers is back and posture problems. These problems relate to musculoskeletal disorders caused by the need for the user to be crouched and hunched towards the monitors and computer components due to the design and positioning of these particular computer peripherals. This hunching forward of the user causes posture and back problems but is also the cause of severe and acute pain in the upper back, particularly pain in the neck and or shoulders. A study was conducted where 2146 technical assistants installed a computer program to monitor the musculoskeletal pain they suffered and answered questionnaires on the location and severity of the pain. The study showed interesting results, as it detailed how in the majority of cases any pain suffered was aggravated and exacerbated by the use of computer peripherals like the mouse and keyboard but overall the pain did not originate from using computers. \\"Moreover, there seems to be no relationship between computer use and prolonged and chronic neck and shoulder pain\\" This is a positive study for computer manufacturers but although the pain may not originate from computer peripherals there is no doubt that the pain is exacerbated by their use and this revelation alone should lead computer manufacturers to pioneer new technologies that reduce the risk of posture or musculoskeletal problems aggravated by the use of poorly designed and linearly designed computer peripherals. In another study, It was found that women are at a greater risk than men to suffer from musculoskeletal problems than men. Two explanations given were that \\"women appear to consistently report more neck and upper extremity symptoms than men.\\", and that women may assume more taxing positions while working than men do due to differences in anthropometrics. =Mental problems= Public Health England said children who spend too long on the internet face social problems such as loneliness, depression and anxiety. According to Dr. Victoria Dunckley, excessive use of electronic screen media can have ill effects on mental health related to mood, cognition, and behavior‚Äîand may even result in psychosis in the form of hallucination. She calls this \\"Electronic Screen Syndrome\\" (ESS). She claims the root of these symptoms appears to be linked to repeated stress on the nervous system, making self-regulation and stress management less efficient. She says interacting with screens shifts the nervous system into fight-or- flight mode which leads to dysregulation as an inability to modulate one‚Äôs mood, attention, or level of arousal in a manner appropriate to one‚Äôs environment. Treatment Modern medical treatment for computer-induced medical problems like carpal tunnel syndrome include splints, surgery, corticosteroids, and physiotherapy therapy. Alternative medicine for computer- induced medical problems has also been shown to be effective, notably acupuncture.

Credit:Wellcome Library Albert Way (23 June 1805 ‚Äì 22 March 1874) was an English antiquary, and principal founder of the Royal Archaeological Institute. Birth and family background Way was born in Bath, Somerset, on 23 June 1805. He was the only son of Lewis Way (1772‚Äì1840) of Stansted Park, near Racton, Sussex, by his wife Mary (1780‚Äì1848), daughter of Herman Drewe, rector of Combe Raleigh, Devon. Lewis was the second son of Benjamin Way of Denham, Buckinghamshire, and elder brother of Sir Gregory Holman Bromley Way. Career Albert Way was educated at home and at Trinity College, Cambridge. One of his Trinity contemporaries was Charles Darwin, whom Way encouraged to continue his insect collecting. Way graduated BA in 1829, and MA in 1834. In his early life, he travelled in Europe and Palestine with his father. Following his father's death in 1840, Way was able to live off his private income. In 1839, Way was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He served as the Society's Director from 1842 until 1846, when he moved to Wonham Manor in Betchworth, Surrey. In 1843, Way became joint honorary secretary, with Charles Roach Smith, of the British Archaeological Association, newly founded by Smith and Thomas Wright. However, Way felt that Smith was too cautious in running the Association, so in 1845 he founded the rival Archaeological Institute (afterwards the Royal Archaeological Institute). He was one of the honorary secretaries to the Institute, and organised many of its meetings and exhibitions in different parts of the country. He had to reduce his involvement after 1863 for health reasons, but he continued to assist with the Institute's Journal until 1868. Way was a skilful draughtsman and an authoritative antiquary, who contributed much to the publications of the Society of Antiquaries and other societies. In a paper published in Archaeologia in 1844, he coined the term \\"palimpsest brass\\". He compiled the first catalogue of the Society's collections of pictures, coins and other miscellaneous objects.Way, A., A Catalogue of Antiquities, Coins, Pictures and Miscellaneous Curiosities in the Society‚Äôs Possession, London, 1847. Way's principal publication was Promptorium parvulorum sive clericorum, an edition of the renowned 15th-century English-Latin dictionary Promptorium parvulorum. On behalf of the Camden Society, he published the work in three volumes, the first printing in 1843. The third and final volume came in 1865. Way died at Cannes, France, on 22 March 1874. Personal life Way married his cousin Emmeline Stanley, daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley, on 30 April 1844. The couple had one daughter, Mary Alithea, born in 1850. Legacy Way's widow presented the Society of Antiquaries with 150 volumes of dictionaries and glossaries from her husband's library, and two volumes of his drawings of prehistoric and other remains. She also presented his collection of several thousand impressions of medieval seals, which became the basis of the largest classified collection of British seal impressions. The Society possesses a wax medallion portrait of Way by R. C. Lucas.

History Thiamethoxam was developed by Syngenta; a patent dispute arose with Bayer which already had patents covering other neonicotinoids including imidacloprid. In 2002 the dispute was settled, with Syngenta paying Bayer $120 million in exchange for worldwide rights to thiamethoxam.Syngenta AG has reached an agreement to pay Bayer AG $120 million to settle a dispute over neonicotinoid chemistry used in insecticides, February 1, 2002 Mechanisms of action Thiamethoxam is a broad-spectrum, systemic insecticide, which means it is absorbed quickly by plants and transported to all of its parts, including pollen, where it acts to deter insect feeding. An insect can absorb it in its stomach after feeding, or through direct contact, including through its tracheal system. The compound gets in the way of information transfer between nerve cells by interfering with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, and eventually paralyzes the muscles of the insects. Syngenta asserts that thiamethoxam improves plant vigor by triggering physiological reactions within the plant, which induce the expression of specific \\"functional proteins\\" involved in various stress defense mechanisms of the plant allowing it to better cope under tough growing conditions, such as \\"drought and heat stress leading to protein degradation, low pH, high soil salinity, free radicals from UV radiation, toxic levels of aluminum, wounding from pests, wind, hail, etc, virus attack\\". Toxicity The selective toxicity of neonicotinoids like thiamethoxam for insects versus mammals is due to the higher sensitivity of insects' acetylcholine receptors. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the U.N. assessed thiamethoxam as \\"moderately hazardous to humans (WHO class III)\\", because it is harmful if swallowed. It found it to be no skin or eye irritant, and not mutagenic in any in vitro and in vivo toxicology tests. FAO described thiamethoxam as non-toxic to fish, daphnia and algae, mildly toxic for birds, highly toxic to midges and acutely toxic for bees. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) classification is: \\"Harmful if swallowed. Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects\\". Sublethal doses of thiamethoxam metabolite clothianidin (0.05‚Äì2 ng/bee) have been known to cause reduced foraging activity since at least 1999, but this was quantified in 2012 by RFID tagged honeybees. Doses of equal or more than 0.5 ng/bee caused longer foraging flights. Regulation =United States= Thiamethoxam is approved for use in the US as an antimicrobial pesticide wood preservative and as a pesticide; it was first approved in 1999.EPA Dec 21, 2011 Thiamethoxam Summary Document Registration Review Initial Docket Entire docket is available here As of 2014, it is approved for use in a wide range of crops.¬ß180.565 Thiamethoxam; tolerances for residues. On September 5, 2014 Syngenta petitioned the EPA to increase the legal tolerance for thiamethoxam residue in numerous crops. It wants to use thiamethoxam as a leaf spray, rather than just a seed treatment, to treat late to midseason insect pests. = Neonicotinoids banned by the European Union = In 2012, several peer reviewed independent studies were published showing that several neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar; that sub-nanogram toxicity resulted in failure to return to the hive without immediate lethality, the primary symptom of colony collapse disorder; and showing environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. However, not all earlier studies carried out before 2014 have found significant effects. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and that the industry- sponsored science upon which regulatory agencies' claims of safety have relied on may be flawed and contain several data gaps not previously considered. In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. The ban restricts the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam on crops that attract bees. In February 2018, the European Food Safety Authority published a new report indicating that neonicotinoids pose a serious danger to both honey bees and wild bees.Damian Carrington, \\"Total ban on bee-harming pesticides likely after major new EU analysis\\", The Guardian, 28 February 2018 (page visited on 29 April 2018). In April 2018, the member states of the European Union decided to ban the three main neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) for all outdoor uses.Damian Carrington, \\"EU agrees total ban on bee-harming pesticides \\", The Guardian, 27 April 2018 (page visited on 29 April 2018). =Other countries= Thiamethoxam is approved for a wide range of agricultural, viticultural(vineyard), and horticultural uses.

The song \\"Shifting Seasons\\" from Full Circle won the U.S. Songwriting Competition first place award for instrumental song of the year. Lawson was also awarded third place for Artist of the Year. In a separate year he received another first place award in the USA Songwriting Competition for the title track of his Traveler album. The Traveler album also won three Gold Medals in the Global Music Awards for Instrumentalist, Album, and Top 10 Albums of the Year. Influenced by Andr√©s Segovia from his mid-teens, he developed an interest in jazz, flamenco, and improvisational Latin and Brazilian guitar styles in his early twenties. After graduating from Duke University he earned a graduate degree from the London School of Economics, then moved to Washington, D.C. in 1998 where he met guitarist Daniel Young (Dan Young) at a local flamenco shop and formed the Latin guitar fusion group Young & Rollins. They released several albums together, including Salsa Flamenca, which landed on the Billboard Chart in 2000, Sevilla (2001), Esperanza (2005) and Mosaic (2006) and played at venues such as the Kennedy Center and Sydney Opera House. Rollins was based in Washington until 2007 when he moved to San Francisco. His solo albums are characterized by an eclectic mix of Middle Eastern, Brazilian, and Arabic music fused with Spanish guitar and backed by an all-star cast of musicians from around the world including Israeli singer and composer Idan Raichel, Brazilian singer Flora Purim, percussionist Airto Moreira, Cuban drummer Horacio Hernandez, Shahin Shahida of Shahin and Sepehr, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Iranian kamancheh player Kayhan Kalhor, Grammy-winning violinists Mads Tolling and Charlie Bisharat, and electric guitarist Buckethead, among others. Lawson is a voting member of NARAS, a member of A2IM, and owner of the independent world music record label Infinita Records.

Early life and family Jayatilleka was born in 1956. He is the son of Mervyn de Silva and Lakshmi Sylvia Fernando. He was named after the Israeli general Moshe Dayan. Jayatilleka was educated at St. Joseph's College, Colombo. After school he studied at Aquinas University College, Colombo before joining the University of Sri Lanka Peradeniya campus, graduating from its successor, the University of Peradeniya, with a first class honours B.A. degree in political science. He was Fulbright Scholar at the Binghamton University between 1982 and 1983, studying for a doctorate in political sociology. Jayatilleka had become involved in radical politics at a young age and whilst studying Advanced Level at Aquinas he was \\"picked up\\" by the Intelligence Services Division and questioned at their headquarters in Longdon Place, Colombo. At Peradeniya he was a member of two radical groups - the Lanka Samaja Adhyayana Kavaya (Lanka Social Studies Circle) and Samaja Adhyayana Kavaya. Whilst at Binghamton he was involved with solidarity movements in support of El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. He returned to Sri Lanka in 1982 to observe the presidential election but, having gotten involved in militant Sri Lankan politics, never returned to Binghamton and dropped out. Jayatilleka has been married three times. He first married a Burgher woman called Margreet and then Pulsara Liyanage. He is currently married to accountant Sanja de Silva. Career Jayatilleka was a visiting lecturer at the University of Colombo from 1982 to 1984. After getting involved in radical politics he and others founded the Vikalpa Kandayama (Alternative Group). Jayatilleka had been a supporter of Tamil militancy for some time and had argued that their actions were a war of national liberation, not terrorism. Vikalpa Kandayama formed a relationship with the Tamil militant Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). Vikalpa Kandayama was banned in 1986 and Jayatilleka was indicted, in absentia, by the Colombo High Court on 14 counts including conspiracy to overthrow the state through violence. In the meantime, Jayatilleka had gone into hiding, spending two years underground in Sri Lanka and one year in India. He was then pardoned by President J. R. Jayewardene. Jayatilleka joined the Sri Lanka People's Party after its leader Vijaya Kumaratunga was assassinated and became a member of the party's central committee. Jayatilleka was Minister of Planning and Youth Affairs for the North Eastern Province between 1988 and 1989 but resigned because of policy differences. Jayatilleka then abandoned his radical beliefs and became a prominent supporter of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, serving as his advisor from 1989 to 1993. He was Director of Conflict Studies at the Institute of Policy Studies (1990‚Äì94) and executive director of the Premadasa Centre (1994-2000). He was also editor of Lanka Guardian, the journal founded by his father, from 1996 to 1998. Jayatilleka received a M.Phil. degree from the University of Colombo in October 2002. He was visiting senior fellow and adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins University between 2005 and 2006. He was later appointed senior lecturer at the University of Colombo. He was a member of the Council of Management of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS). He received a PhD degree from the Griffith University in 2007 after writing a thesis titled The Moral Sierra Maestra: The Moral-Ethical Dimension of the Political Thought of Fidel Castro. Jayatilleka was Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva between June 2007 and October 2009. During his tenure he was chairman of the International Labour Organization's governing body (2007‚Äì08); vice president of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) (2007‚Äì08); and co-ordinator of the Asian group on United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2009). Jayatilleka is credited with shielding Sri Lanka from censure by the UNHRC for alleged human rights violations during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009. Jayatilleka had been appointed for a two-year term but when his contract expired in June 2009 President Mahinda Rajapaksa extended his contract until June 2010. However, on 17 July 2009 the Foreign Ministry told him by fax to \\"relinquish [his] duties and return to Colombo on 20 August\\". According to Jayatilleka no reason was given for his sacking but it was suggested that Sinhalese nationalists were unhappy with support for the implementation of the 13th Amendment. Jayatilleka was visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) in 2010. He was honorary senior fellow at ISAS between 2011 and 2013. He was Ambassador to France, also accredited to Portugal and Spain, and Sri Lanka‚Äôs permanent delegate to UNESCO from January 2011 to January 2013. Jayatilleka has written articles and columns for several publications including the Daily Mirror, Daily News, The Island, Lakbima, Sunday Island, Sunday Observer and Weekend Express. Views = Alleged racism and fear mongering = Despite his past support of the LTTE after Dayan began to support Mahinda Rajapaksa he is accused of becoming racist against Tamils and having double standards when Tamils are concerned as well not differentiating the LTTE from the Tamil people and democratically elected Tamil politicians. In his articles Dayan attacked the Wickremesinghe-Sirisena government for \\"serving the minorities\\" and claimed that the planned new constitution will federalize and divide Sri Lanka which will cause the \\"Sinhala national consciousness\\" to be atomized and disintergrate and empower the \\"Tamil consciousness\\". Further he claimed that the agenda of the \\"Tamil bourgeoisie\\" and \\"Diaspora capitalists\\" is to use the constitution is to \\"rewire and reprogram\\" the Sinhala consciousness so they can never win another war, divide and rule the \\"majority\\" and weaken the national state. His statements have been harshly criticized by critics as fear mongering to the benefit of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his camp. = Views on Gotabaya Rajapaksa = Dayan was known for his opposition to Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has implied of him being the creator of Bodu Bala Sena with the help of Israel but Dayan denies that he was talking about Gotabaya but as the creator of the BBS but was involved in Zionist influence in Sri Lanka. Dayan believes that Gotabaya is following a form of Sinhala-Buddhist ultra-nationalism which he has named ‚ÄòGotabayanism‚Äô which according to him is \\"part uber-Trumpian, part ‚ÄòEastworld‚Äô, all uber- hawk\\".

Most of New England consists geologically of volcanic island arcs that accreted onto the eastern edge of the Laurentian Craton in prehistoric times. Much of the bedrock found in New England is heavily metamorphosed due to the numerous mountain building events that occurred in the region. These events culminated in the formation of Pangaea; the coastline as it exists today was created by rifting during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The most recent rock layers are glacial conglomerates. thumb  Chronology  = Overview = The bedrock geology of New England was heavily influenced by various tectonic events that have occurred since the Paleozoic Era including the accretion of land masses that formed various continental terranes to the Mesozoic rifting of the Hartford Basin. = Archean and Proterozoic eons = In the Archean Eon Western Massachusetts and Vermont were the eastern edge of Laurentia (now the Canadian Shield). Laurentia is believed to have originated at the end of the Hadean, making it one of the oldest regions with continental crust, as evidenced by the discovery of Acasta Gneiss in Canada. At the end of the Hadean massive eruptions of felsic lava became cool enough to form permanent crust. The felsic nature of Laurentia allowed it to float over the denser ocean basins that surrounded it, so it was not submerged under the then- forming oceans. During the Archean Eon the surface of New England was a coastal desert covered by silica-rich sediments with outcroppings of granite bedrock. = Paleozoic Era = Starting in the Paleozoic Era the supercontinent Pannotia began to break up, forming smaller continents including Laurentia (North America and Greenland), Gondwana, Baltica, and Siberia. At the same time sea levels were rising, which resulted in the flooding of most of the continents with shallow epicontinental seas. This was followed by three periods of extensive orogeny.Marshank, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, Third Edition, Norton, p. 306-308. Much of the geology in New England is based on formation of the Appalachian Mountains through a series of Paleozoic accretion episodes to the terminal collision between Laurentia (proto‚ÄìNorth America) and Gondwana (proto‚ÄìAfrica‚ÄìSouth America) at ca. 300 Ma.Hatcher, R. D., 2010, The Appalachian orogen: A brief summary: Geological Society of America Memoirs, v. 206, p. 1-19. Cambrian Period Ordovician Period During the Middle Ordovician period of the Taconic orogeny, volcanic island arcs collided with the eastern coast of North America, causing extensive metamorphism, faulting, and uplift. The result of these processes were the Taconic Mountains, located along the border of New York and New England.Raymo, Chet and Raymo, Maureen E. (1989). Written in Stone: A Geologic History of the Northeastern United States. Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot. After the Taconic orogeny, the Humber seaway was on its way to closure; at the same time, the Dashwoods microcontinent accreted to Laurentia. This then led to the accretion of oceanic terranes including the Bay of Islands in Newfoundland and Thetford Mines Ophiolites in Quebec. Additionally, the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian m√©lange was present, which consisted of blueschists and deepwater deposits. These blueschists and deepwater deposits indicate that subduction continued during this period of time.  Silurian Period  Closure of the Tetagouche-Exploits back-arc in the Early Silurian (430 Ma) accreted the bulk of Ganderia to Laurentia. This event is known as the Salinic Orogeny and was responsible for most of the bedrock that is found in New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Maine.Van Staal, C., 2005, The Northern Appalachians: Encyclopedia of geology, v. 4, p. 81-91. Examples include the Rangeley sequence found in the Presidential Range that consists of Silurian and Devonian Turbidite sequences, Early Silurian Rangeley Formation, the Middle to Late Silurian Perry Mountain, Smalls Falls, and Madrid Formations.  Devonian Period  The Acadian orogeny took place during the middle to late Devonian. Following the subduction of the Iapetus Ocean floor, the microcontinent Avalonia slammed into eastern North America, which caused another period of metamorphism, faulting, and mountain building. Evidence for these events can be found within the Littleton Formation on the summits of the Presidential Range in northern New Hampshire and southern Maine. The Littleton Formation was deposited in the Early Devonian, approximately 409 million years ago with a Gander and/or Avalon Terrane source.Eusden J. D. Jr., Guzofski, C. A., Robinson, A. C., and Tucker, R. D., 2000, Timing of the Acadian Orogeny in Northern New Hampshire, Journal of Geology, v. 108. p. 219-232. The lower part of this formation is found proximal to the Bronson Hill Island Arc and consists of basaltic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks along with low grade metamorphic shale while the upper part of this formation consists of the youngest rocks of the Presidential Range. This area has experienced extensive deformation which is expressed as pre- metamorphic faults, various folds, thrust faults, and doming. Evidence for igneous activity include the early-Devonian (408 Ma) diorites, early to mid- Devonian (390‚Äì400 Ma) granites, and the Carboniferous (360‚Äì350 Ma) granites.  Carboniferous and Permian periods  The Alleghenian Orogeny occurred during the late Paleozoic and was the result of the collision of Africa with North America during the formation of Pangea. The collision events produced tremendous occurrences of thrust faults, folding, and metamorphism. As a result of this collision event a huge mountain belt formed that ran up the east coast of North America into Canada and Baltica, which had collided with Greenland and northern North America. Rocks were newly deformed and folded from the coast to as far as the Allegheny Plateau and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Although the modern-day Appalachian Mountains have been heavily weathered over time, they were thought to once rival the Himalayas in size. =Mesozoic Era=  Triassic Period   Jurassic Period  Depiction of the process of a caldera collapse, in this case Mount Mazama but representative of the general progression. New England, like the rest of the eastern United States, does not contain any active volcanoes in the present era. However, the White Mountains region of New Hampshire contains strong evidence of volcanic activity approximately 145 million years ago. Volcanic formation in the White Mountains has been estimated to have occurred between the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods, and would have coincided with the separation of Pangaea. As Pangaea broke apart and land masses were shifting, large features like the White Mountains were formed; at the same time, as this multitude of cracks was occurring, magma rose up and filled many of these voids. In this manner calderas were formed throughout the White Mountains as magma receded; these calderas then subsequently erupted on a scale dwarfing the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The results of these massive eruptions can be found in such places as the Ossipee Mountains, which are located proximal to the White Mountains. The Ossipee Mountains contain substantial amounts of volcanic rock, and the many ring dikes across the region indicate that there was once an active volcano on the site. Volcanic rocks can also be found throughout the White Mountains beyond the Ossipee region, further confirming that eruptions occurred across the area millions of years ago.  Cretaceous Period  = Cenozoic Era =  Paleogene Period   Neogene Period   Quaternary Period  Much of the geomorphology and surficial deposits of New England are a result of glaciation in the Quaternary period. The scoured New England landscape reveals evidence of the Wisconsin Glacial Period.  Surficial deposits  The continental ice sheet over New England was more than a mile thick in some places. Grinding and plucking over the landscape created wore down topography and created poorly sorted to well sorted surficial deposits. Large terminal moraines composed of poorly sorted till are present along coasts and can be identified by their thin, patchy, and stony texture. Maine is bordered by moraines that identify the terminus margins of the past ice bodies. The Waldoboro terminal moraine sits on the southeastern coast, while the Highland front moraine parallels the northwestern border. Large continental ice sheets (see Laurentide Ice Sheet) most likely created the large moraines, as it takes time for the long, lumpy ridges to form at a massive scale. New England is best known for its high density of erratics, which are displaced rocks that differ from the immediate bedrock composition of the region and range from the size of pebbles to boulders. Their surfaces are generally rounded and polished due to rasping. While the bedrock of the area is largely igneous granite, the erratics are sandstone and slate blocks. Sedimentary erratics are visible across the highest peak in Maine, Mount Katahdin. Glacial outwash that is well sorted and stratified due to the systematic nature of Stoke's Law is visible in gravel pits in Maine's Grafton Notch State Park Outwash plains are composed of alternating layers of sand and gravel that have been deposited in deltas of glacial lakes and alluvial fans. = Erosional processes = The slow and grinding movement of continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers across the landscape creates erosional landforms. Abrasion, plucking, and freeze-thaw action creates the U-shaped valley unique to glacial erosion. The intense pressure from the ice causes abrasion. This process carves striations, or grooves, into the bedrock as the glacier moves down a slope. Glacial striations help determine the direction of a glacier; visible outcrops in the White Mountains, for instance, indicate ice flow toward the south- southeast.Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry, 2002, Glacial and Postglacial Geology Highlights in the White Mountain National Forest, Western Maine: http://digitalmaine.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&context;=mgs_publications Abrasion also produces rock flour which is visible in glacial outwash plains across New England. Maine has some of the longest eskers in the world. As the climate began to warm, the glaciers began to melt and drainage from meltwater under the glacier formed huge torrents of sediment that, when compacted, left a long and sinuous ridge or kame. Moose Cave in Grafton Notch is speculated to have been formed in part by a subglacial river.Doughty, A.M., Thompson, W.B., Grafton Notch State Park: Glacial Gorges and Streams under Pressure in the Mahoosic Range, Maine. Abol esker in Baxter State Park is a notable serpentine kame. Kame and kettle topography is commonplace across Maine. Hummocky morphology includes kettle ponds and kettle lakes that are ‚Äústeep-sided, bowl- shaped depressions in glacial drift deposits\\" where large blocks of ice melted as the glacier recessed. Other notable glacial features include cirques, which are visible in mountains such as Mt. Katahdin and Crocker Mountain, indicative of glacial erosion. = Pleistocene Epoch = Depiction of the Laurentide Ice Sheet covering most of Canada and the Northern United States The Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered Canada and what is currently the New England landscape, was a massive sheet of ice and the primary feature of the Pleistocene epoch in North America. Geologists are currently working on calculating the thinning of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which can improve the accuracy in de-glacial paleoclimate models and ice margins. Geologic records in the Northeastern United States can help reconstruct ice sheet volume history as well as the contribution of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Cosmogenic Nuclides are radioactive isotopes formed when high-energy particles (i.e. cosmic rays) interact with the nuclei of Solar System atoms. Calculating the abundance of these nuclides is a way to determine the age of exposure of surface rock, also known as Surface Exposure Dating.IVY-OCHS, S., KERSCHNER, H., REUTHER, A., MAISCH,M., SAILER, R., SCHAEFER, J., KUBIK, P.

A group of geologists in New England have been using an age-exposure method called the 'Dipstick' Approach, which can determine the rates of ice-sheet thinning and the age of glacially eroded boulder and bedrock surfaces. This approach has been used on various New England mountains, including Mt. Greylock, Mt. Mansfield, Mt. Washington, etc. Their research supports rapid de-glaciation around New England, further constraining previous estimates of the Laurentide Ice Sheet thinning rates.Halsted, C.T., Shakun, J.D., Davis, P.T., Bierman, P.R., Corbett, L.B., Koester, A.J., 2018, Mount Greylock as a cosmogenic nuclide dipstick to determine the timing and rate of southeastern Laurentide ice sheet thinning in Grove, Tim and Mango, Helen (editors), Guidebook for field trips in New York and Vermont: New England Intercollegiate Geological Conference, 110th Annual Meeting and New York State Geological Association, 90th Annual Meeting, October 12‚Äì14, 2018, Lake George, N.Y., 301 p, color.  Meltwater Pulse 1a  Thinning of the LIS was caused by rapid warming of the Northern Hemisphere produced by a sudden shift towards an interstadial AMOC from 14.6‚Äì14.3 ka, a period also known as the B√∏lling warming.McManus, J.F., FRancois, R., Gherardi, J.M., Keigwan, L.D., Brown-Leger, S., 2004. Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes. Nature 428, 834‚Äì837. This change in climate caused global sea levels to rise 9‚Äì15 m due to deglaciation of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.Deschamps, P., Durand, N., Bard, E., Hamelin, B., Camoin, G., Thomas, A.L., Henderson, G.M., Okuno, J.I., Yokoyama, Y., 2012. Ice-sheet collapse and sea-level rise at the B√∏lling warming 14,600 years ago. Nature 483, 559‚Äì564. doi:10.1038/nature10902 It is uncertain what particular ice sheets contributed the most to the significant sea level rise, but evidence collected from cosmogenic nucleotide dating indicates rapid thinning of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP-1A) which could mean the LIS was a main source of glacial meltwater during this time.  The Younger Dryas and Onset of the Holocene  After MWP-1A, around 12.9 ka, the Northern hemisphere experienced a sudden drop in temperatures caused by a reduction in the AMOC towards a stadial mode, which is implicated to be caused by the influx of glacial meltwater from the LIS and is a period known as the Younger Dryas.McManus, J.F., Francois, R., Gherardi, J.M., Keigwin, L.D., Brown-Leger, S., 2004. Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes. Nature 428, 834‚Äì837. The AMOC recovered back to an interstadial mode by 11.7 ka which marked the beginning of the Holocene Epoch. =Holocene Epoch= White Pine rose in New England shortly after the first deglaciation. Following the glacial melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, new vegetation and warmer climate caused new New England to become inhabitable by early human settlers. This new climate, combined with an ample supply of hard volcanic rock and other natural features, created an ideal area for human settlement. These settlers fashioned tools, such as arrowheads, from surficial rhyolite deposits they found near what could have been their river valley settlements. The melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (beginning by 18,000 cal yr BP) caused significant ecological and climatic change in the region. Except for a number of abrupt climate reversals, the most extreme being the cold reversal of the Younger Dryas, the climate of the region generally experienced a rise in temperature (of up to 2Àö Celsius) during the early Holocene. Fossil pollen findings indicate that the increased temperature in the region paralleled new vegetation patterns, such as the rise of hemlock and white pine in New Hampshire and the White Mountains. These vegetation shifts created ecological environments in the region where habitation by migratory caribou, which were hunted by early human settlers, was possible. These settlers could have moved to recently formed dune fields, which were produced by wind erosion of glacial outwash deposits, such as those found in the Ohio Valley, in the Hudson and Connecticut River valleys, and in the Israel River valley. Early human settlers could have populated these river valleys in order to observe the caribou migrating northeast along the newly formed rivers.

In 1972, all of the top eight places in the European Championship were riding Wasp outfits. History Wasp was founded in 1964 by engineer and off-road motorcyclist Robin 'Robbie' Rhind-Tutt, who was originally employed by the Ministry of Defence as an engineering apprentice at Boscombe Down. He designed and built a number of off-road motorcycle frames which he used in motocross competitions. Other competitors were interested in Rhind-Tutt's frames and commissioned him to build specialist frames, so he decided to form Wasp Motorcycles Ltd. The company changed its name to Wasp Engineering Ltd in 1997, but continues to trade under the name of Wasp Motorcycles. A Wasp/BSA motocross sidecar outfit ridden by former world motocross champion Dave Bickers was used in the 1979 World War II film Escape to Athena, disguised to look like a German military BMW R75. Products Wasp manufacture and modify sidecar motocross, sidecar grasstrack ('side-car- cross'), and solo motocross motorcycles. They also produce motorcycle leading link suspension for sidecars and fork conversion kits for road bikes to improve braking and handling, and they manufacture M√©tisse frames pioneered by Rickman Motorcycles.

Legacy Anthem won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Recording in 1985, the first year the award existed. The album was well-received, earning Black Uhuru the highest accolades and broadest audience of their career. The traditionally non-reggae elements added in the remixes were polarizing. Both Robert Christgau and Allmusic's John Gonsalves were dubious about the remixes; Christgau felt that the songs held up in spite of the added effects while Gonsalves did not.

It is a popular tourist destination where, each year, a knight's tournament and a garrison festival are held. Of this once relatively impregnable castle, which was built in the early and high Middle Ages on a 294 metre high sandstone rock towering over the surrounding area, only ruins are visible today. Several internal rooms, carved into the rock, have survived, as have the ruins of the keep. The castle is surrounded by remnants of a more recent fortress. Regenstein Castle is No. 80 in the system of checkpoints on the Harzer Wandernadel hiking trail network. Below the castle is the site of the old Regenstein Mill that used to supply it with water.  Castle of the Regenstein counts  The keep in 1162 the Comes de Regenstein (Count of Regenstein), Conrad, was mentioned for the first time. He was the son of Count Poppo I of Blankenburg from the House of Reginbodonen). The castle became renowned mainly through Count Albert II of Regenstein (1310-1349) who, in the 1330s, had frequent disputes with the rulers of the surrounding towns, the Bishop of Halberstadt and the Abbess of Quedlinburg. This has been romantically recounted in the ballad, Der Raubgraf (\\"The Robber Count\\"), by Gottfried August B√ºrger (music by Johann Philipp Kirnberger) and the novel by Julius Wolff (Der Raubgraf). In the 15th century, the Regenstein counts moved to Blankenburg Castle. Regenstein fell into disrepair and became a ruin. The last male descendant of the noble family, Count John Ernest of Regenstein in 1599. In 1643 after several changes of ownership Regenstein, which was sometimes written as Rheinstein or Reinstein, was enfeoffed by Archduke Leopold William of Austria in his capacity as Bishop of Halberstadt to the Lower Bavarian count, William of Tattenbach. From then on members of this noble family went under the title of \\"Count of Reinstein-Tattenbach\\". In 1671 John Erasmus, Count of Reinstein-Tattenbach was beheaded in Austria for being party to the magnate conspiracy, following which Prince-Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg confiscated the county.  Prussian fort  The keep Regenstein Castle from the crest of the Ziegenberge. In the foreground: the village of Heimburg Room hewn out of the rock in the medieval castle in the centre View towards the Scharfe Ecke (\\"sharp angle\\" Fortification ditch and gateway From 1671 the medieval castle was expanded into a fortress by the Prussians, who were the last users of its military function. The original castle occupies only a small part of the greater fortification. In 1677 the fort became a garrison. The length of its outer perimeter was extended in 1742 to 1,200 metres. Even under the French, to whom the fortress had to be handed over on 12 September 1757, it was extended structurally. The Prussians captured it five months later (12 February 1758) and rendered the position unusable. The powder magazine, which was located near the top was blown up. Of the fortress only the casemate, those facilities carved out of the rock and the (now restored) gateway remain. A characteristic of the fortress is the large number of cavernous rooms in the natural rock (one now houses an exhibition of archaeological finds from the castle site). Even the stables were hewn out of the rock. After 1758, the pastures and forests of the Regenstein went to the Prussian Amt of Westerhausen. From 1815 to 1945, following the reign of Westphalia (1807-1813, Canton Halberstadt Land), Regenstein became the smallest Prussian exclave and belonged to the district of Halberstadt. Today it is part of the town of Blankenburg. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the Regenstein on 11 September 1784 together with the artist, Georg Melchior Kraus, on his third trip to the Harz (8 August to 14 September 1784) to conduct geological studies (two drawings and a rock sample from Goethe's collection of rocks recall that visit). The first restaurant was opened in 1812, thus beginning the rock's role as a tourist attraction.  The legend of the Regenstein  According to legend, once upon a time one of the most beautiful young women in the land was imprisoned in the dungeon of Regenstein Castle, because she had spurned the love of the Count of Regenstein. Using a diamond ring she scratched a hole in the rock, which became so large after a year that she was able to crawl through and escape. After her escape, she returned with her family to the castle, but the count had fled. A little later, she noticed thick smoke gushing from a crack in a rock wall. When she looked through it, she saw the count in purgatory. Then, out of pity, she threw him her ring to him in order to enable the spirit of the count to rest.

Individual components of a VTS include, a settling structure, an outlet structure, a distribution system, and a Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA). All these components when used together are considered to be a Vegetative Treatment System. Introduction A Vegetative Treatment System (VTS) is a new alternative treatment option for treating the runoff from an animal feeding operation in an effort to protect water quality in South Dakota (SD). A VTS consists of a sediment basin to settle the solids from the feedlot, and uses controlled release of the liquids to a vegetated treatment area (VTA). The VTA area is commonly confused with vegetative buffer (or filter) strips. A buffer strip is a narrow strip of vegetation (usually 30‚Äì60 feet wide) between cropland or a water source, such as a river, lake, or stream. In contrast, a VTA is a specifically sized area of perennial vegetation to which runoff from a barnyard or feedlot is applied uniformly. The VTA utilizes the water holding capacity of the soil to store the runoff water until the nutrients and water can be used by the vegetation. Therefore, the application of the runoff to the VTA must be at a rate to prevent deep percolation below the root zone, and not allow the flow to extend past the end of the VTA. A VTS can be an economical alternative to runoff retention (holding) ponds for controlling runoff from an open lot feeding production system (feedlots). A Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA) is an area of perennial vegetation, such as a grass or a forage. The VTA is used to treat runoff from a feedlot or barnyard. It treats runoff by settling, infiltration, and nutrient use. Runoff passes through buffers with some ‚Äúfiltering‚Äù of pollutants, but no attempt is made to control solids or flow. A VTS, however, collects runoff from a barnyard or feedlot, separates the solids from the liquids, and uniformly distributes the liquid over the vegetated area. Little or no runoff should leave a VTA. Runoff is first collected from an open lot or barnyard area in a sediment settling structure, usually a basin. Such basins are very effective for removing most solids. The runoff then flows into a VTA where the soil treats and stores the runoff. Once the runoff is in the soil, natural processes allow plants to use the nutrients. The general idea behind VTS technology is that the plants will take up the nutrients contained in the runoff and that natural processes will eliminate undesirable components such as pathogens. There are many different types of VTA‚Äôs such as level, infiltration basins, sloped, sprinkler, dual and multiple systems, etc. A Vegetative Treatment System can be used to manage runoff from open lots of both AFOs and CAFOs. VTS systems for large CAFOs can be permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) in the US. Advantages * May provide lower initial investment and operating costs * More aesthetically palatable than large ponds * No long-term storage of runoff required, such as holding or evaporation ponds * Fewer safety issues * Land designated for VTA can produce usable forage Disadvantages * A VTA may not be a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù system; * Saturated soils from previous rains could allow a discharge * Special management required during runoff events * The VTAs can be damaged by a lack of maintenance and attention - gullies, erosion, and poor vegetation stands dramatically reduce their effectiveness * Not currently permittable in SD by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources * The VTAs may not provide the same level of water quality improvement as a total runoff containment system, such as holding or evaporation ponds provide References # Introduction to Vegetative Treatment Systems # Need a Vegetative Treatment System for Your Barnyard or Lot? a Small Farms Fact Sheet from the Livestock and Poultry Environmental Learning Center External links * Introduction to Vegetative Treatment Systems * VTS guidance document from the Heartland Regional Water Coordination Initiative * Animal Feeding Operation Information from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln Category:Environmental soil science Category:Hydrology ","title":"Vegetative treatment system"},{"id":"29576146","text":"was a mid-station along the Nakasend≈ç in Edo period Japan.

He was born in Bamaw, Kachin State, Myanmar in 1948. He attended the Defence Services Academy, Pyin Oo Lwin and after graduating served in various positions as an army officer. As of 2010, he was head of the Public Relations and Information Department of the Yangon City Development Committee. Artistic work Hla Myint Swe works in watercolor, oil, acrylics and photography. He is best known for his lifelike ink drawings, particularly of the national races, in which he tries to capture the personality and mood of his subject through a drawing of the face or full figure. He came to use this medium while serving in the army, since he could sketch anywhere with no more than a ballpoint pen. His Spiritual Soulfulness of Myanmar (1997), is a collection of essays and photographs from the Myanmar Theravada perspective. An English-language version of the book was issued in June 2008. Myanmar National Tribes is a collection of sketches showing the dresses and life-style of nationalities such as Lisu, Wa, Naga, Akha, Chin, Jingphaw, Padaung and Shan. For his seventh book, Buddham Dhammam Samgham: Buddhist faith in Myanmar, published in December 2009, Hla Myint Swe travelled through Myanmar and Nepal to take the photographs. In Nepal, he photographed the pilgrimage site of Lumbini, considered the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, the Nepalese prince who later founded the Buddhist tradition. Other photographs show Buddhist monks, nuns, temples and pagodas as well as spectacular local scenery. Government position As head of the Yangon City Development Committee's public relations and information department, he is also head of the City FM radio station. In February 2004 the station launched the Hello! FM program in which experts would give answers to questions mailed in by the audience, such as on the procedures to follow to open a shop or obtain a building permit. His department also runs The Monitor, a newspaper. Discussing press freedom in October 2010, he noted that \\"There is no country that has absolute freedom of the press,\\" going on to say that \\"In some situations it‚Äôs right that some information is not released\\". But he also noted that due to the centralist government structure, many civil servants were afraid to speak to journalists since action could be taken against them, and said he had experienced this himself.

He presented the equipment to the Director of Medical Services, Brigadier General Mya Thein Han. In June 1999 Hla Myint Swe met the staff of Myanmar Airways International, urging them to work hard, seek ways to earn more foreign exchange, be loyal to the State, take innovative measures, uphold national prestige and integrity and make all- out efforts for development of the State. In April 2000 he led the Myanmar delegation at a meeting in Tachilek, Shan State, where China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand signed an agreement on Commercial Navigation on the Lancang River - Mekong River. In May 2000, he was included on the list of persons to whom the EU visa ban applied, and whose funds held in the EU would be frozen. In 2003 Hla Myint Swe's spouse Daw San San Myint was included in the EU ban. These restrictions were confirmed in April 2004. In September 2002 Hla Myint Swe represented Myanmar at a meeting of transportation ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), where the attendees said they would liberalize the movement of people and goods within the region. He attended the ninth ASEAN Transport Ministers meeting on 23‚Äì24 October 2003, where the ministers had a candid exchange of views on broadening and deepening of policy and program directions for ASEAN transport cooperation.

The eligibility requirements are: 1\\\\. Forty-eight months' experience as a CM in the qualifying areas as defined by the Qualifications Matrix and 2. One of the following: *An undergraduate (4-year BA/BS level) or graduate degree in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science. *A 2-year undergraduate degree (AA/AS level) or certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 4 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.) *No degree/certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 8 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.) In addition, two reference letters from a client or owner are required; they can be from any two projects that a candidate is documenting as part of their 48-month requirement. Finally, the candidate must pass the certification exam. Most applicants are certified within 4 to 7 months of submitting their applications. The length of time it takes to become certified depends upon how quickly a candidate can submit a complete application including project documentation, how quickly the references respond, and how quickly a candidate can take and pass the CCM exam. In 2013, the Construction Industry InstituteConstruction Industry Institute at the University of Texas adopted the CCM as \\"a value-adding credential\\" following a joint effort to compare and harmonize CII's Construction Best Practices with the CMAA SOP, and to assure that the CCM examination measured and recognized mastery of the Best Practices. Education In 2013, CMAA became a member society of ABET, formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technologies, the leading organization accrediting undergraduate and graduate education programs in engineering and related fields. ABET has introduced a new accreditation for undergraduate programs in Construction Management, with program-specific criteria adopted in 2015. Advocacy CMAA does host an advocacy program to represent the construction management industry before the United States Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and industry stakeholders.CMAA Website: Government Affairs http://cmaanet.org/government-affairs CMAA is active in several industry coalitions advocating investment in infrastructure and other industry interests. College of Fellows A designation CMAA awards to certain members who have proven to be industry leaders and \\"who have made significant contributions to their organizations, the industry and their profession,\\" according to CMAA.Members of the CMAA College of Fellows http://cmaanet.org/fellows The College of Fellows meet consistently to discuss CM standards and issues facing the profession. The College also produces industry topic white papers and all members are particularly active in the association, often having served as past national presidents or in other leadership roles. Publications The association produces several publications, including the Construction Management Standards of Practice which defines the standards and practices of the construction management profession. Other CMAA publications include a bi-monthly newsletter, the CM Advisor. Events CMAA hosts two industry events every year for the construction management profession. CMAA's signature event is its National Conference & Trade ShowNational Conference & Trade Show held every fall.The national conference offers multiple seminars which count toward CCM certification or renewal, as well as Continuing Education Units for a variety of purposes. The conference also includes an awards ceremony known as the Project Achievement Awards. CMAA designates a panel of judges to evaluate and select entries of projects with the most significant contributions to the construction management industry.CMAA Project Achievement Awards CMAA's Capital Projects Symposium is held every spring. The Symposium is designed for as a high level exploration of trends and issues affecting the delivery of capital projects and programs. CMAA has also conducted regular surveys of owner attitudes, preferences, needs and expectations across the industry, along with research into CM/PM fees, adoption of technology, workforce concerns and other topics.

He is best remembered for coaching the Massillon Tigers to an Ohio League title in 1906, over the Canton Bulldogs, which led to accusations of a betting scandal. In 1907, he coached a version of the Massillon Tigers called the \\"All-Massillons\\" to another Ohio League title. Prior to his professional career, Wightman played at the college level for the Chicago Maroons, under Amos Alonzo Stagg, and Swarthmore College. Massillon Tigers Wightman was named the coach of the Massillon Tigers in 1906 after E. J. Stewart was promoted to the title of team manager. Wightman's first order of business was to replace four of the Tigers players who were a part of the club's 1905 Ohio League championship. Quarterback Jack Hayden, tackle Jack Lang, guard Herman Kerchoff, and end Clark Schrontz were all convince to play for the Bulldogs in 1906 by Canton coach Blondy Wallace. Wightman replaced Kerchoff with, an ex-teammate from his playing days at Chicago and Swarthmore, Tiny Maxwell. Meanwhile Ted Nesser and E.P. King were signed to solidify the offensive line. However, the biggest signing for Wightman was the signing of Peggy Parratt as the team's new quarterback. At the end of the season, Canton and Massillin decided to play a two game home-and-home series to determine the 1906 Ohio League champions. Homer Davidson, who was considered the best kicker of the era was also signed by Wightman for the game, just in case Massillon needed a field goal or extra point. Under the rules of the series, the winners of game 2 would be the league champs. The first game went to Canton by a score of 10-5. However, Massillon won the rematch 13-6 and was named the Ohio League's 1906 champions. =Scandal= After the series was over, both teams and their fans heard rumors that the second game of the series was fixed. One story suggested that Canton players had bet large amounts of money on themselves to win, while approaching the Massillon players and asking them to throw the game in exchange for a share of Canton's winnings. However, Wightman was accused of being behind the scandal by Massillon end Walter East. As proof that Wightman was at the root of the fix attempt, East furnished the Akron Beacon-Journal a copy of a contract in which Wightman agreed to have the November 16 game thrown for $4,000. It was signed by East, John T. Windsor, one of the owners of the Akron Giants baseball team, and Wightman. After reading East's charges, Wightman gave an interview to The Plain Dealer in which he stated: \\"Anything and everything I did in conjunction with East and Windsor was done in accordance with instruction from Manager Stewart and the backers of the Massillon team. When East first came to me with his scheme I reported his proposition to my employers and they told me to go ahead with it and see to what lengths East would go. Consequently, I strung them along until I had the signatures of East and Windsor down on paper. When that was done East was released, and it was seen that we had gold- bricked them. Consequently the great plunging of the first game on the part of the bettors did not take place. East's statement does not worry me in the least, for I am innocent of any attempt to pull off any dishonesty.\\" E.J Stewart backed up Wightman's statement. Meanwhile, Dr. Harry March stated in his 1934 book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs, which documented the scandal, that Wallace persuaded a Canton player to deliberately throw the game. Wallace later filed a libel lawsuit against Stewart and his newspaper, the Massillon Independent, for $25,000. The case was settled out of court. The scandal still remains a mystery to this day and was said to have ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s. However, some historians argue that the expense of placing all-star teams on the field each week also put a hamper on the sport. The Canton Morning News put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many speculate that the Bulldogs probably cost even more. \\"All- Massillons\\" The Tigers reorganized into the \\"All-Massillons\\" in 1907, after which professional football in Massillon effectively stopped. The team was made up of many of the former Tigers players and was coached and managed by Wightman. The team defeated the Columbus Panhandles, with the Nesser Brothers in the line-up, 13-4, and celebrated its fifth consecutive state championship. Because of that game's importance, Massillon brought in two ringers, Peggy Parratt and Bob Shiring. The next season Wightman and several ex-Massillom players traveled to Canal Dover and played for the Dover Giants. While the Giants had never been a major factor in the \\"Ohio League\\", the transfusion of the ex-Tigers players instantly made them a powerhouse. The Giants claimed the 1908 state championship at the end of the season, however the claim received little support outside of Dover since they played a weak schedule.

Nearby is the Little Castle with its Baroque garden, tea house and museum, the town wall, the pheasant garden, the castle park and the castle pond. History Around 1123 Lothair of S√ºpplingenburg had Blankenburg Castle built on the Blankenstein. Its suzerainty later passed to the House of Welf through Henry the Proud and Henry the Lion. In 1128 Poppo, from the Frankish noble family of Reginbodonen, was given the county as a fief. His sons shared the county: Conrad received Regenstein Castle and Siegfried I, the Blankenburg. Siegfried I (Henry the Lion) did not return from a pilgrimage and left two sons, Henry and Siegfried II. In 1181 the castle and town of Blankenburg were besieged, under the direction of Bishop Dietrich of Halberstadt, by imperial armies. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa took over the reins of power. In 1182 Blankenburg was captured and eventually handed over for plundering. The brothers, Henry and Siegfried II went into captivity, but were given the county back again after peace was re-established. The castle was rebuilt and greatly extended. In 1190 Count Henry took over the \\"agreed\\" estates of Regenstein and Siegfried II retained the County of Blankenburg, his descendants keeping possession of Blankenburg until 1343. Thereafter, the Blankenburg and Regenstein Castle went back to the younger Heimburg line of the House of Regenstein. In 1386, according to legend, the Blankenburg was supposed to have been secretly looted in the night by Dietrich of Wernigerode, while Count Busso was absent. There is a carved head in the castle wall that recalls this raid. Around 1500 Count Ulrich XI, despite serious debts, had the east wing knocked down and a palace-like building constructed. In 1539 Count Ulrich V broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. On 19 November 1546 a fire broke out at night before the new building had been occupied, which destroyed large parts of the old castle. According to legend, the fire was start with dry kindling by the castle firelighter under the stairs of the old castle, after baptists had paid him with gold. The sleeping residents noticed the fire too late. The maids and servants fled onto the rooftops and out of the windows and down the walls, but forgot their masters. The younger children were dropped out of the windows by their nurses wrapped in blankets. Countess Magdalena of Regenstein was trapped by the flames. The countess asked her husband, Count Ulrich to leave her and save his life. The count escaped through the toilet window and hung from it on the outside before being rescued having been badly burnt. In memory of the fire and the dead, Count Ulrich had a plaque made with inscriptions in Latin and German. It portrays the count, the countess, their six sons and four daughters. In 1599 the House of Regenstein died out and the castle went back to the dukes of Brunswick. In 1705 the conversion of the Renaissance castle into a Baroque residence was started by state architect, Hermann Korb, on behalf of Duke Louis Rudolf of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. The reconstruction resulted in a simpler and clearer structure of the outer shape and lasted until 1718. Also created were reception rooms (the Grey Hall, Reduten Hall and Imperial Hall) in the interior, and a multi-storey, octagonal royal church. When Elizabeth Christine married the future emperor, Charles VI, during the time of residence of Louis Rudolf, Emperor Joseph I elevated Blankenburg to the status of a principality. Elisabeth Christine's mother later became the Empress Maria Theresa. Blankenburg Castle The family of the Duke Ernest Augustus of Brunswick (1887‚Äì1953) and his wife Duchess Victoria Louise, Princess of Prussia (1892‚Äì1980), lived in the castle from 1930 until their flight and the expropriation of their property in 1945. The family had been given the castle as their private property as compensation in the wake of loss of the principality in 1924. In 1917 the only daughter of the Duke and Duchess, Frederica, who was later Queen of the Hellenes and mother of the Spanish queen, Sophia, was born here. In 1937, the Duke and Duchess hosted a ball here celebrating the engagement of their daughter Frederica with then crown prince Paul of Greece. The court of Blankenburg became famous for its brilliant festivals and theatrical performances. After 1945 the House of Hanover was expropriated, thereby losing the Old and the New Castle together with vast forests at Blankenburg, as well as Hessen castle and estates. Instead, the Technical College for Domestic Commerce was housed in Blankenburg Castle. During this time the building was architecturally maintained. Following the closure of the school with the demise of East Germany in 1990 a long period began in which the castle was not used and the building became neglected as a result.Artikel Schloss Blankenburg ‚Äì Gef√§hrdet at welt.de Plans by a buyer, who had acquired the castle in 1996, to run a major tourist project did not come to fruition.

It is based on relays and was developed by Norsk Signal Industri for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) during the early 1960s. The systems are installed at railway stations and passing loops and consist of single relays built form drawings. The system is simple, robust and economical for smaller stations on single-track railways. The system makes use of track circuits for train detection.Norwegian Railway Inspectorate (2001): 25 History NSB-63 was based on NSB-EB, the very first automatic interlocking system used in Norway.Norwegian Railway Inspectorate (2001): 11 NSB-63 is the most common system used in Norway, with about 220 installed interlockings belonging to the Norwegian National Rail Administration. This is more than the combined number of other interlocking systems. About 140 of the systems were installed during the 1960s, with about 80 installed during the 1970s.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 39 NSB later developed a series of modified versions of NSI-63, which were installed up until the 1990s. The first development was NSI-63/PLS, which used programmable logic controllers (PLC) instead of telephone relays. Other variations include NSB-78 and NSB-84,Norwegian Railway Inspectorate (2001): 12 which have about 25 and 10 installed units, respectively. The most extensive redevelopment of NSI-63 is NSB-87. It was developed to be installed on the R√∏ros Line, including all stations between Hamar and R√∏ros, and selected stations on the Nordland Line. It was designed to only work at the simplest stations, and lacks some of the more advanced features in NSI-63. NSB-87 was developed by SattControl, now part of ABB Group, who made the computer and communication systems, based on PLC. The National Rail Administration made the relay circuits and the software. The design of NSB-87 included a simplification of the NSI-63 design, in particular to reduce costs. During the 1990s, NSB and its successor the Norwegian National Rail Administration chose to install Siemens ESTW on the Gardermoen Line, and Adtranz-developed NSB-GS at Oslo Central Station. Following the √Östa accident, the Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized the National Rail Administration for having installed NSB-87, a system that by the time it was installed, was out of date, a mixed relay and PLC technology in an inappropriate way. From the mid-2000s, Norway has been required to implement European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) on all new lines. The first part of this, GSM-R, was finished installed on the whole railway network from 2 January 2007.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009a): 42 The estimated lifetime of NSI-63-based systems are 40 to 50 years.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 17 The National Rail Administration has started a plan to replace the existing interlocking systems with an ERTMS-compatible system.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009b): 63 In 2008, the Merkur system designed by ABB was not permitted used by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate, and the National Rail Administration has chosen to instead adopt a strategy to retain the use of NSI-63 on all new railway projects until the introduction of ERTMS Level 2. As of 2010, the administration's plan is to build the Eastern √òstfold Line with ERTMS by 2014, and from 2015 convert the remaining parts of the network. The administration has estimated the cost to rebuild the signaling throughout the network to between 15 and 20 billion Norwegian krone. The Swedish Transport Administration plans to build ERTMS on two of the lines that connect to Norway, the V√§rmland Line and the Norway/V√§nern Line, by 2020.

In Spain, balneario typically only refers to spa town resorts. Whatever the case, these resorts offer recreation, sports, entertainment, food, hospitality and safety services, retail, and cultural events. These balneario towns are characterized by being flooded by masses of tourists during the summer seasons. Re√±aca beach is a popular balneario in Valpara√≠so Province, that attracts tourists from across Chile, South America, and the world.

Balnearios may be as simple as a beach or as complex as a planned city. Mexico's Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta are balneario city-destinations, for example, while Chile's San Alfonso del Mar is a more planned resort community and its Vi√±a del Mar a city that also happens to be a balneario. Balnearios are characterized by having beaches and hot climates, being seasonal destinations, attracting foreign tourists, and having boom periods surrounding festivals. The word comes from Spanish, and the difference between a \\"playa (beach) and a balneario is the services provided at the balneario.

It is one of the largest secondary academies in Newcastle. History The school first opened in 1959 as three schools on one site, a Grammar School and two Secondary Moderns. These later merged to become the single Walbottle Campus Technology College. The vast majority of the school's students come from feeder Primary Schools which are members of the Outer West Learning Trust, of which Walbottle Campus is an Associate Member. In 2008, Walbottle Campus received a brand new state of the art building as part of the governments 'Building Schools for the Future' PFI scheme. Previously named Walbottle Campus Technology College, the government removed the funding for the 'technology college' status therefore the school was renamed Walbottle Campus. Academisation Following Walbottle Academy‚Äôs predessor school's Ofsted inspection in February 2019 and the Inadequate judgement, Walbottle Campus began plans to convert to Academy Status. In July 2019, Walbottle Campus received its academy order from former Secretary of State for Education Damian Hinds and talks began between Multi Academy Trusts and the board of governors. Northern Education Trust, a successful academy trust based in Ryton, Gateshead, showed excessive interest in working with Newcastle City Council to help transform Walbottle Campus with regards to behaviour, student grades and attainment and school management. Northern Education Trust made an arrangement with Newcastle City Council to manage the school and improve it before set decisions were made regarding the school's future. It was confirmed in January 2020, that due to a successful trial, Northern Education Trust would become the official sponsor for Walbottle Campus, aiming to officially takeover the school in September 2020. Walbottle Campus became an official member of the Northern Education Trust on 1st September 2020, and therefore was renamed 'Walbottle Academy'.  Building Walbottle Academy's new building opened in 2008 after being rebuilt as part of the governments Phase 1 PFI Newcastle Building Schools for the Future Programme. It opened alongside six other schools which were also rebuilt in the Phase 1 part of the programme. Four other schools later opened in 2011 as part of Phase 2 of the programme. * A Wing - Health and Social Care, Child Development and Care, Business studies, Hairdressing, Sixth Form & SEN Department. * B Wing - Humanities and MFL * C Wing - English * D Wing - Mathematics and Art * E Wing - Technology * F Wing - Science * H Wing - Physical Education, Performing Arts, Music, Head of School and Main Administration * K Main Street - Entrance to all wing, I.C.T Classrooms, Cafe and Library Ofsted In the Ofsted Inspection of 2016, Walbottle Campus was graded 'good' after previously receiving 'requires improvement' on previous inspections.
