Early life and education F. Ll. Griffith was born in Brighton on 27 May 1862 where his father, Rev. Dr. John Griffith, was Principal of Brighton College. After schooling at Brighton College (1871), then privately by his father, he went to Sedbergh School, Yorkshire (1875–78) and Highgate School (1878–80). At Highgate he developed the interest in ancient Egypt that was to determine the rest of his life. Griffith was awarded a scholarship to Oxford University in 1879 and studied at The Queen's College from 1880 to 1882: in the absence of an Egyptological department he taught himself ancient Egyptian.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 204, p. 959 Career Griffith worked as a student for The Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) (later known as the Egypt Exploration Society), a society established in 1882 by Amelia Edwards and Reginald Stuart Poole. This society funded excavations in Egypt and provided opportunities for student apprentices to learn how to excavate and give aspiring Egyptologists a chance to publish their findings. Griffith was urged by his professor to write to Flinders Petrie, an Egyptologist working for the EEF, to see if he could serve as an assistant. He could not afford to finance himself, and Petrie and Edwards were able to convince the EEF to fund Griffith through a scholarship.Flinders Petrie: A Life in Archaeology, University of Wisconsin Press 1995, p. 85 Griffith trained under Flinders Petrie at the Fund's Naukratis excavation.Report of Third Annual General Meeting & Balance Sheet 1885, [n.p.] [1885], p. 5.

This allowed him to endow the study of Egyptology at Oxford. In 1909 he married Nora Christina Cobban Macdonald (1870–1937), who assisted him in his studies and excavations in Egypt and Nubia in 1910–13, 1923, 1929 and 1930, and prepared his unfinished work for publication after his death. Nora was from Aberdeen, and in 2017 the city council approved erection of a blue plaque to honour her as a \\"noted Egyptologist\\". After the establishment of a post in Egyptology, Griffith was appointed Reader in 1901. He was Professor of Egyptology at the university from 1924 until 1932 and died in 1934.

She worked in the fields of philosophy and sociology. Notable facets of her work include criticism of neo- Kantianism, post-modernism, and political theology along with what has been described as \\"a forceful defence of Hegel's speculative thought.\\"From the back cover of the 2009 Verso Books reprint of Hegel contra Sociology. Early life Gillian Rose was born in London into a non-practising Jewish family. Shortly after her parents divorced, when Rose was still quite young, her mother married another man, her stepfather, with whom Rose became close as she drifted from her biological father. These aspects of her family life figured in her late memoir Love's Work: A Reckoning with Life (1995). Also in her memoir, she writes that her \\"passion for philosophy\\" was bred at age 17 when she read Pascal's Pensées and Plato's Republic.Rose, Gillian (1995). \\"Love's Work\\".

She never forgot Austin remarking in class, \\"Remember, girls, all the philosophers you will read are much more intelligent than you are.\\"Rose (1995). p. 129. In a late interview, Rose commented of philosophers trained at Oxford, \\"It teaches them to be clever, destructive, supercilious and ignorant. It doesn’t teach you what’s important.

Before beginning her DPhil at St. Antony's College, Oxford, she studied at Columbia University and the Free University, Berlin. Career Rose's career began with a dissertation on Theodor W. Adorno, supervised by the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski, who wryly spoke to her of Adorno as a third-rate thinker. This dissertation eventually became the basis for her first book, The Melancholy Science: An Introduction to the Thought of Theodor W. Adorno (1978). She became well known partly through her critiques of postmodernism and post-structuralism. In Dialectic of Nihilism (1984), for instance, she leveled criticisms at Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida. Later, in her essay \\"Of Derrida's Spirit\\" in Judaism and Modernity (1993), Rose critiqued Derrida's Of Spirit (1987), arguing that his analysis of Heidegger's relation to Nazism relied in key instances on serious misreadings of Hegel, which allowed both Heidegger and Derrida to evade the importance of political history and modern law. In an extended \\"Note\\" to the essay, Rose raised similar objections to Derrida's subsequent readings of Hermann CohenDerrida, Jacques (1991). \\"Interpretations at War: Kant, the Jew, the German\\". New Literary History 22. pp. 39–95. and Walter Benjamin,Derrida, Jacques (1990). \\"Force of Law: The 'Mystical Foundation of Authority,'\\" in two Parts. Cardozo Law Review vol. 11, 5–6. pp. 919–73; 973–1039. singling out his notion of the \\"mystical foundation of authority\\" as centrally problematic.Rose, Gillian (1993). Judaism and Modernity. Blackwell. pp. 79–87. Her first academic appointment was as a lecturer in sociology in 1974 at the School of European Studies (the University of Sussex). In 1989, Rose left Sussex for the University of Warwick when a colleague was unexpectedly promoted over her. Inquiring about the promotion with economist Donald Winch, the then pro-vice-chancellor, he told her that her future at the institution was not bright: \\"He said to me that I was working in a contextual manner and that the future belonged to those whose work was acceptable to the Government, to industry and to the public.\\" Her chair at Warwick in Social and Political Thought was created for her and she was encouraged to bring her funded PhD students with her.Williams, Elaine (1995). \\"'Keep your mind in hell and despair not,'\\" The Times Higher Education Supplement, issue 1171, April 14, 1995, p. 15. She held her position at Warwick until her death in 1995. As part of her thinking into the Holocaust, Rose was engaged by the Polish Commission for the Future of Auschwitz in 1990, a delegation which included theologian Richard L. Rubenstein and literary critic David G. Roskies, among others. She wrote about her experience of this commission in her memoir Love's Work and in Mourning Becomes the Law and Paradiso. One of her colleagues on the commission, Marc H. Ellis, has written about Rose's experience as well: > At a crucial moment in our deliberations on the historical knowledge of the > Polish guides, Rose spoke, out of turn and off the subject, of the nearness > of God. This was a violation of etiquette, and worse. Rose was suggesting > that the anger of these delegates, for the most part Holocaust scholars and > rabbis, was a retrospective one that, paradoxically sought the Holocaust > past as a safe haven from inquiries of the present conduct of the Jewish > people.Ellis, Marc H. (2000). \\"Questioning Conversion: Gillian Rose, George > Steiner, and Christianity.\\" In Revolutionary Forgiveness: Essays on Judaism, > Christianity, and the Future of Religious Life. p. 231. Rose's memoir, Love's Work, detailing her background, maturation as a philosopher, and years-long battle with ovarian cancer, was a bestseller when it was published in 1995. \\"She has, hitherto, been a respected, weighty, but lone voice among a specialised readership,\\" wrote Elaine Williams at the time, \\"[but] she has, since her illness, been driven to write philosophy which has created ripples of excitement among a wider critical audience.\\"Williams (1995). p. 15. Marina Warner, writing for the London Review of Books, said \\"[Love's Work] provokes, inspires and illuminates more profoundly than many a bulky volume, and confronts the great subjects...and it delivers what its title promises, a new allegory about love.\\"Warner, Marina (1995). \\"Fierceness,\\" London Review of Books vol. 17, 7, April 6, 1995, pp. 11. In a review in The New York Times, upon the publication of the U.S. edition of the book, Daniel Mendelsohn wrote, \\"'Love's Work' is a raw but always artfully wrought confrontation with the 'deeper levels of the terrors of the soul'\\"Mendelsohn, Daniel (1996). \\"Keep Your Mind in Hell,\\" The New York Times, January 21, 1996, S7, pg. 34. Love's Work was re-published by NYRB Books in 2011, in the NYRB Classics series, with an introduction by friend and literary critic Michael Wood and including a poem by Geoffrey Hill, which he had dedicated to her. In a review of the re-publication, in The Guardian, Nicholas Lezard commented, \\"I struggle to think of a finer, more rewarding short autobiography than this.\\"Lezard, Nicholas (2011). , The Guardian, June 30, 2011. Death Rose was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1993. She died in Coventry at the age of 48. She made a deathbed conversion to Christianity through the Anglican Church.Wolf, Arnold Jacob (1997). \\"The Tragedy of Gillian Rose.\\" Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought 46, no. 184. (Andrew Shanks notes that \\"there is evidence, among the papers left behind from her final illness, that at one point [Rose] seriously considered the alternative of Roman Catholicism.\\"Shanks, Andrew (2008). Against Innocence: Gillian Rose's Reception and Gift of Faith. SCM Press. p. 178, note 8.) She left to the library of Warwick University parts of her own personal library, including a collection of essential works on the History of Christianity and Theology, which are marked \\"From the Library of Professor Gillian Rose, 1995\\" on the inside cover. Rose is survived by her parents, her sister, the academic and writer Jacqueline Rose, her half sisters, Alison Rose and Diana Stone, and her half brother, Anthony Stone. Archives Rose's papers are held by Warwick University Library in the Modern Records Centre. PhilosophyDialectic of Nihilism (1984)= Rose's third book, Dialectic of Nihilism, is a reading of post-structuralism through the lens of law. Specifically, she attempts to read a number of thinkers preceding and constituting post- structuralist philosophy against Kant's \\"defense of the 'usurpatory concept' of freedom\\",Rose, Gillian (1984). Dialectic of Nihilism. Basil Blackwell. p. 12. that is, his answer to the question of \\"How [Reason] is to justify its possession\\" of freedomRose (1984). p. 12. \\"through pure reason, systematically arranged.\\"Kant, Immanuel (1781). Critique of Pure Reason. Trans. Norman Kemp Smith. Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. A xx/p. 14. Cited in Rose (1984). p. 12. Rose's primary foci are Martin Heidegger, to whom she devotes three chapters, and Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida, to whom she devotes one chapter apiece. In addition, however, she scrutinises a few of the neo- Kantians (Emil Lask, Rudolf Stammler, and Hermann Cohen), Henri Bergson, and Ferdinand de Saussure and Claude Lévi-Strauss. Her central argument is that with the post-structuralists a \\"newly insinuated law [is] dissembled as a nihilistic break with knowledge and law, with tradition in general.\\"Rose (1984). p. 7. Describing this situation in the case of Foucault, Rose writes, \\"like all nihilist programmes, this one insinuates a new law disguised as beyond politics.\\"Rose (1984). p. 173. Concomitantly, Rose contends that similar fates befall the neo-Kantians and other thinkers who try to transcend or ignore the problems of law. According to Rose, the neo-Kantians seek to resolve the Kantian antinomy of law \\"by drawing an 'original' category out of the Critique of Pure Reason, be it 'mathesis', 'time', or 'power'\\", yet remain unable to do so because \\"[t]his mode of resolution ... depends on changing the old sticking point of the unknown categorical imperative into a new vanishing point, where it remains equally categorical and imperative, unknowable but forceful\\";Rose (1984). p. 4. while other thinkers—including Lévi-Strauss and Henri Bergson—\\"fall into the familiar transcendental problem\\"Rose (1984). p. 129. wherein the \\"ambiguity in the relation between the conditioned and the precondition is exploited.\\"Rose (1984). p. 111. The philosopher Howard Caygill—also Rose's literary executor—has taken issue with her readings of Deleuze and Derrida in Dialectic of Nihilism, going so far as to call some of them \\"frankly tendentious\\".Caygill, Howard (1998). \\"The Broken Hegel\\". Women: A Cultural Review, Vol. 9 Issue 1. p. 24. In a more critical review of the book, Roy Boyne, too, argues that Rose failed to do justice to these figures. \\"She operates on the highest plane of abstraction\\", Boyne writes, \\"for it is only at that level that the polemic makes any sense. Were she to drop down a level or so, she would see that the position she is so concerned to defend is not under attack from the quarters to which she addresses herself.\\"Boyne, Roy (1986). \\"Book Review: Dialectic of Nihilism: Post-Structuralism and Law\\". Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 15, No. 3. p. 437. However, Caygill insists that \\"Whatever the shortcomings of the readings in Dialectic of Nihilism and the unfortunate and unnecessary borders it raised between Rose's thought and that of many of her contemporaries, it did mark a further stage in her retrieval of speculative thought.\\"Caygill (1998). p. 24 Scott Lash has asserted that the \\"real weakness of Dialectic of Nihilism is its propensity toward academic point-scoring\\", the result of which, according to Lash, is Rose's \\"devoting some half of its length attempting to discredit the analysts under consideration with their own assumptions, rather than straightforwardly confronting them with her own juridical prescriptions.\\"Lash, Scott (1987). \\"Book Review: Dialectic of Nihilism, Post-Structuralism and Law\\". Theory and Society, Vol. 16, No. 2. p. 308. Yet Lash considers her chapters on Derrida and Foucault to be partial remedies to this issue. Influence and legacy Already in 1995, Rowan Williams commented, \\"Gillian Rose's work has had far less discussion than it merits.\\"Williams, Rowan (1995). \\"Between Politics and Metaphysics: Reflections in the Wake of Gillian Rose.\\" Modern Theology, Vol. 11, No. 1 p. 16. In the decades following Williams' statement others have reiterated the sentiment. Indeed, scholar of religion Vincent Lloyd comments: > Everywhere I went I kept encountering professors who loved Rose's work, who > thought she was brilliant and right, but who had for one reason or another > never mentioned her name in print. There were Jeffrey Stout and Cornel West > at Princeton, both of whom taught Rose's books, Paul Mendes-Flohr at Chicago > who knew her well, and Judith Butler and Daniel Boyarin at Berkeley.Lloyd, > Vincent (2018). \\"The Race of the Soul: On Gillian Rose.\\" In Religion of the > Field Negro: On Black Secularism and Black Theology. Fordham University > Press. p. 217. Nevertheless, Rose's work has made more explicit inroads among a number of important thinkers, not the least of them Williams, whose revaluation of Hegel in the 1990s has been attributed to Rose's influence.Myers, Benjamin (2012). Christ the Stranger: The Theology of Rowan Williams. T&T; Clark International. p. 52. On the philosophy of Hegel, in a text of 1991, Slavoj Žižek writes, \\"one has to grasp the fundamental paradox of the speculative identity as it was recently identified by Gillian Rose.\\"Zizek, Slavoj ([1991] 2008). For They Know Not What They Do. Verso Books. p. 103. Žižek here refers to Rose's second book Hegel contra Sociology (1981); subsequently, his Hegelianism was dubbed \\"speculative\\" by Marcus Pound.Pound, Marcus (2008). Žižek: A (Very) Critical Introduction. Wiliam B. Eerdmans. pp. 49-51. In turn, Howard Caygill observes of Hegel contra Sociology: \\"This work revolutionized the study of Hegel, providing a comprehensive account of his speculative philosophy that overcame the distinction between religious (‘right Hegelian’) and political (‘left Hegelian’) interpretations that had prevailed since the death of the philosopher in 1832.\\"Caygill (2004). And the work is still cited in Hegel scholarship.See, e.g., Browning, Gary K. (ed.) (1993). Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit: A Reappraisal. Kluwer; Marasco, Robyn (2015). The Highway of Despair: Critical Theory after Hegel. Columbia University Press.; Tubbs, Nigel (2008). Education in Hegel. Continuum. Two of Rose's students, Paul Gilroy and David Marriott, have emerged as key thinkers of critical race theory and have acknowledged her influence.Gilroy, Paul (2013). \\"Paul Gilroy Interview—2 June 2011.\\" Cultural Studies, Vol. 27, No. 5 p. 750; and Marriott, David (2007). Haunted Life: Visual Culture and Black Modernity. Rutgers University Press. p. 273, note 1. In Marriott's poetry collection In Neuter the poem \\"Remains of the Day\\" is dedicated to the memory of Gillian Rose. Marriott (2013). In Neuter. Equipage. pp. 19–21. When John Milbank published Theology and Social Theory in 1990, he cited Rose as one of the thinkers without whom \\"the present book would not have been conceivable.\\"Milbank, John ([1990] 2006). Theology and Social Theory: Beyond Secular Reason. Blackwell. p. viii. Marcus Pound recently found that \\"Rose was the Blackwell reader for Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory. The Rose archives at Warwick include the letters Milbank and Rose exchanged on the subject. In particular she pushed him to clarify the nature of the subject which underpinned Theology and Social Theory. In response Milbank wrote 'The Sublime in Kierkegaard'.\\"Pound, Marcus (2015). \\"Political Theology and Comedy: Žižek through Rose Tinted Glasses.\\" Crisis and Critique, Vol. 2, No. 1 p.185, note 53. Two special issues on Gillian Rose have appeared from scholarly journals. The first, \\"The Work of Gillian Rose,\\" appeared in 1998 in volume 9, issue 1 of the journal Women: A Cultural Review. It contained contributions from students and friends, including Laura Marcus, Howard Caygill, and Nigel Tubbs, as well as an edited transcription of \\"two W. H. Smith exercise books containing the notes and observations that [Rose] had been writing...until shortly before her death\\" in hospital.Rose, Gillian (1998). \\"The Final Notebooks of Gillian Rose.\\" Women: A Cultural Review, Vol. 9, No. 1 p. 6. The line quoted comes from Howard Caygill's brief prefatory note. An essay by literary critic Isobel Armstrong, which appeared alongside but not as a part of the special issue, turns on Rose's concept of \\"the broken middle\\" and presents a careful and appreciative reading of her work. In 2015 the journal Telos released a special issue on Rose, gathering responses and critiques to her work from Rowan Williams, John Milbank, Peter Osborne, and Tubbs.Gillian Rose. Telos (Winter 2015). In 2019, The Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London established an annual Gillian Rose Memorial Lecture.

Due to its prominence when seen from the lower ground of the Central Belt, Ben Vorlich is one of the most commonly seen of Munros, Scotland's peaks of 3000ft height or above. It lies in an area of land bounded to the north by Loch Earn, and to the west by Loch Lubnaig. The town of Callander lies to the south. Ben Vorlich is most frequently climbed from Ardvorlich to the north. A path leads up Glen Vorlich, and then heads for the mountain's northern ridge. The summit lies 4 km from Ardvorlich. Many walkers then continue on to the neighbouring hill, Stùc a' Chroin, by way of Ben Vorlich's south west ridge. Return to Ardvorlich can be made without re-ascending Ben Vorlich, as a path leads from the bealach between the two hills round Ben Vorlich's northwestern slope to meet the main ascent path. Other possible routes from the southern side allow one to ascend Ben Vorlich by way of its southeastern ridge. This can be accessed either from Glen Artney to the southeast or Callander to the south.

He's also a writer / commentator on dance music and popular culture. Career1975–1980= Growing up in New Brighton on Merseyside, Wilson lived above his family's pub during the years 1966–1973. The premises included two function rooms where he'd witness mobile discos featuring on a weekly basis at wedding receptions and parties. His main musical influences came from the record collections of his elder brother and sister, especially the soul music labels Tamla Motown, Stax and Atlantic. Wilson began his career as a DJ in 1975 at the age of 15, having bought a mobile set-up from his schoolfriend Derek Kelsey (later known as DJ Derek Kaye). He began a residency at local nightspot The Chelsea Reach on 6 December 1975, and remained at the venue until 1977. Further local residencies followed at The Penny Farthing (1976–1977) and The Golden Guinea (1977-1980), where he first built his reputation as a black music specialist, playing soul, funk, disco and jazz-funk. He also worked as a DJ in Denmark and Norway during a 2-month period in 1978. =1980–1983= Wilson left the Golden Guinea in 1980 and worked in Denmark and Germany before returning to the UK to take a 4 night a week residency at Wigan Pier. In 1982, he became a full-time black music specialist, continuing Wigan Pier's Tuesday night jazz-funk session, which was voted the North's Best Club by Blues & Soul readers, with Wilson collecting the Best DJ award. He controversially championed early electro records at Wigan Pier and, most notably, Manchester club Legend, where he took over their Wednesday jazz-funk night in 1981. As with Wigan Pier, people travelled to his nights at Legend from places including Birmingham, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford, Nottingham, Liverpool and London. Legend attracted a predominantly black crowd to listen to the new electro-funk records, which were mainly coming out of New York City. Wilson also began to take a serious approach to mixing around this point, and is regarded as one of the UK pioneers. In 1982, he began to present regular mixes of the music he was playing in the clubs on Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, and these featured on Mike Shaft's specialist black music show T.C.O.B (Taking Care of Business). These radio mixes are still talked about as being influential to this day, with the end of year Best of 82 and Best of 83 mixes regarded as classics. In February 1983, Wilson was invited to demonstrate live mixing on the Channel 4 TV show The Tube. Interviewed by one of the show's presenters, Jools Holland, Wilson, with Mike Shaft commentating, mixed 2 copies of David Joseph's \\"You Can’t Hide (Your Love from Me)\\", then a new release, but subsequently a UK top 20 hit. This was the first time a British DJ had mixed live on TV. Wilson was a fixture on the All-Dayer circuit in the North and Midlands between 1981-1984, regularly appearing alongside other black music specialists including Colin Curtis, Mike Shaft, John Grant, Hewan Clarke, Richard Searling, Kev Edwards, Pete Haigh, Jonathan, Trevor M and Cleveland Anderson. In 1983, Wilson began a Friday night residency at The Haçienda club in Manchester, which had opened the previous year. This was the club's first weekly dance music night and would lay the groundwork for its influential Nude night, also held every Friday, which came to prominence in the mid-'80s with DJs Mike Pickering and Martin Prendergast. Wilson also put together the first UK re-edit, Paul Haig's \\"Heaven Sent\\", in 1983, and taught Norman Cook (a.k.a Fatboy Slim), then a young aspiring DJ called Quentin, how to scratch in December 1983 during a short Haçienda tour of the South. =1984–1987= At the end of 1983, aged 23, Wilson retired from DJing to focus on record production, as well as managing Manchester breakdance crew Broken Glass. They gained national exposure via TV appearances including a famous edition of The Tube, filmed at The Haçienda in January 1984, on which Madonna made her UK live TV debut. Later in 1984, along with musicians Martin Jackson and Andy Connell, he co-wrote and produced all but one of the tracks on the Street Sounds UK Electro album, now revered as a seminal British dance album, the first to feature sampling. One of the tracks, \\"Style of the Street\\", a recording by Broken Glass, was sampled itself 20 years later on the 2004 Prodigy hit \\"Girls\\". Wilson split from Jackson and Connell, who went on to form the band Swing Out Sister, and ceased managing Broken Glass. Mounting financial problems caused him to lose his car and then his house in Wigan. Re- locating to Liverpool in 1985, he briefly worked for the short-lived record label Ryker, before unsuccessfully attempting to launch his own label. Experiencing mounting financial problems, and with Liverpool in deep recession at the time, he moved to London in 1987 in order to try to resurrect his fortunes. =1987–1993= In 1987, Wilson began to manage and produce Manchester's Ruthless Rap Assassins and sister band Kiss AMC. The Rap Assassins included former Broken Glass member Paul ‘Kermit’ Leveridge along with brothers Anderson and Carson Hinds. The Rap Assassins released two critically acclaimed albums via EMI, Killer Album (1990) and Th!nk (It Ain’t Illegal Yet) (1991). Their best known recording, \\"And It Wasn’t a Dream\\", a minor chart hit in 1990, focused on the plight of West Indian immigrants coming to the UK in the 1950s and 1960s, and was named amongst Mojo's \\"50 Greatest British Tracks Ever\\" in 2006. In 2011, urban artist Roots Manuva would hail their music as \\"the roots of grime\\". Between 1990 and 1993, he collaborated with singer Tracey Carmen, releasing a handful of records as Mind Body & Soul (or MBS). The first of these, a dance version of Jefferson Airplane’s psychedelic classic, \\"White Rabbit\\", was championed by Radio 1 DJ John Peel. =1993–2003= The following decade was something of a wilderness period for Wilson, but in 1994 he revisited his electro-funk past, compiling the Classic Electro Mastercuts album. This would generate a small number of DJ bookings, his first in 10 years, in promotion of the album. In 1996, he was part of a collective of DJs and musicians who promoted a series of nights called The Monastery in Birkenhead, Liverpool and London. A mix, The Monastic Mix, was the last he ever put together on reel-to-reel. =2003–present=DJ comeback Alerted by the lack of documentation of the specialist black music scene that had helped shape contemporary dance culture, he announced the website electrofunkroots.co.uk in 2003. The site documents the early '80s era, what led up to it and what came out of it. Offers of DJ bookings followed and on 20 December 2003 Wilson made his DJ comeback at a night called Music Is Better in Manchester club The Attic. This was the launchpad that re-ignited Wilson's DJ career 20 years on from his retirement. As his popularity increased, he appeared throughout the UK, Europe and the world, gaining newfound followers from a new, younger generation of clubbers. In 2005, his re-edits compilation Credit to the Edit, released on the Tirk Recordings label, was the catalyst for his international success, helping to establish him, once again, as a scene leader. Apart from working as a DJ and remixer, Wilson has written on various aspects of dance / black culture with articles published in magazines / webzines including Wax Poetics, Clash, Grand Slam, Strobelight Honey and Discopia. His Discotheque Archives series for DJ Magazine ran for 25 editions between 2016-2018. His blog, Being a DJ, was launched in June 2010, and his observations on various aspects of club culture are now an online touchstone for dance music enthusiasts. Wilson has also been interviewed for a number of books, TV and film projects focusing on the history of club culture. Musical output Credit to the Edit Volume 2 was released in November 2009, with tour dates throughout the following months in the UK, Europe, Japan, Australia and the U.S. to promote the album. The series returned in April 2018 with Credit to the Edit Volume 3 and during that year Wilson became more active in the studio, working on various remix and re- edits projects, including some collaborations with his son Ché Wilson, the first of which to be released was a remix of \\"Out the Window\\" by Australian band Confidence Man, released on Heavenly Records. Wilson has produced a series of documentative podcasts, Time Capsule, Random Influences and Early 80s Floorfillers, as well as the long-running blog series, Living to Music, where people were encouraged to listen to a monthly album selection in their home environment. This served to influence other related listening events, including Colleen Murphy's Classic Album Sundays audiophile sessions. Commencing in 2009, Wilson had built a strong following on SoundCloud with regular uploads of DJ mixes, mainly live recordings, with over six and a half million plays up to 2019. Festivals In August 2010, he co-curated, with Jack Hemingway, the Warehouse and Roller Disco areas at the inaugural Vintage Festival at Goodwood. It was named ‘Best New Festival’ at the UK Festival Awards, whilst Wilson, in his role of DJ, was nominated in the ‘Best Feel Good Act of the Summer’ category. The following year, he and Hemingway curated the Warehouse and Style Studio areas as Vintage was hosted at London's Southbank. Wilson has appeared at festivals throughout the UK and Europe as well as in the US, Australia, Japan, Brazil and Mexico. In addition to his DJ work, Wilson has given talks on music and dance culture at numerous events including Afro Modern at Tate Liverpool, Vintage at London Southbank, Salon at Standon Calling and Festival N°6 and alongside legendary figures Nile Rodgers and Giorgio Moroder at ADE in Amsterdam. Super Weird Substance 10 years on from his DJ return, in 2014 he unveiled his new multi-media label Super Weird Substance, releasing the Blind Arcade Meets Super Weird Substance in the Morphogenetic Field mixtape before following it up with a series of 5 Super Weird Happenings in different locations across the UK. In 2015, the label released 8 vinyl singles, brought together in the 2 CD compilation, Greg Wilson Presents Super Weird Substance. September saw a memorable Festival No. 6 Happening in Portmeirion. Collaborating with celebrated comic book writer Alan Moore, a second mixtape, Alan Moore's Mandrill Meets Super Weird Substance at the Arts Lab Apocalypse appeared in 2017, followed by the 14 Hour Super Weird Happening at The Florrie, with Moore making a rare appearance in Liverpool.

Early life  He was born at Chimpay, a small town in Valle Medio, Río Negro Province, Argentina, the sixth child of Rosario Burgos and a Mapuche cacique, Manuel Namuncurá. At the age of eight, he was baptized by a Salesian missionary priest, Domingo Milanesio. Namuncurá's early years were spent by the Río Negro river, and it was here that he, according to legend, miraculously survived a fall into the river. His father Manuel, Chief of the Mapuches, promoted to honorary colonel in the Argentine army, decided that his son study in Buenos Aires, in order to prepare himself \\"to be useful to his people.\\" Thanks to the friendship of Manuel with General Luís María Campos, Minister of War and the Navy of Argentina, the boy came to study in the National Workshops of the Navy as a carpenter's apprentice. There he would remain for three months. Being the only native Indian in the school Ceferino found himself mistreated by the other students and he soon fell ill. He wrote to his father that he was not happy in that place and Manuel then asked former Argentine president Luis Sáenz Peña's advice. He recommended to Colonel Manuel Namuncurá that he send the boy to the Salesians of Don Bosco. Education On September 20, 1897, Ceferino went to study with the Salesians at the Colegio Pío IX, a technical academy in Almagro, Buenos Aires. There he showed himself to be an excellent student and choral musician. He enjoyed his studies and sports and was known to perform card tricks for his classmates or teach them archery. From April 2, 1901, Carlos Gardel, afterwards a legendary tango singer and film actor, became a student at the academy and sang along with Ceferino in the chorus. When he finished his studies, Manuel his father wanted him back home, to serve as interpreter and secretary, but Ceferino was already enthusiastic about becoming a Salesian priest.  In Italy  Although his health was already generally frail, Ceferino began studying for the priesthood. In 1904, he departed for Italy accompanying Mgr. Giovanni Cagliero, a former disciple of Don Bosco who was to become an Archbishop. Pope Pius X received them in September, after which Namuncurá moved to Turin and later to the Salesian College \\"Villa Sora\\" in Frascati, to continue his education. He became increasingly ill during the Italian winter and was taken to Rome, where he finally succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis on May 11, 1905, at the Fate bene fratelli hospital.  Back to Argentina  In 1924 his remains were returned to Argentina and placed in the chapel at Fortín Mercedes, in the southern part of Buenos Aires Province. In 1945, a request for his beatification was forwarded to the Holy See. Between May 13 and July 10, 1947, the Church officially started the process for Canonization of Ceferino Namuncurá, with 21 then-living witnesses deposing evidence in favour of his virtues. At his birthplace of Chimpay a small chapel was erected, where believers from Río Negro Province and beyond began to pray for his intercession. On June 22, 1972, Pope Paul VI promulgated the Decree of Heroism of His Virtues and Ceferino was thus proclaimed venerable, becoming the first Catholic Argentine to receive that title and the first South American aborigine. The devotion to Ceferino Namuncurá, the saintly young Mapuche, known popularly as The Lily of Patagonia (\\"El lirio de la Patagonia\\") became very extensive in Buenos Aires and throughout Argentina. In particular the indigenous people recognise him as one of their own. The affection of the people of Argentina for this selfless young man is quite touchingly sincere and images and representations of his face are myriad. In 1991 his relics were translated from the small sanctuary chapel to the roomier Sanctuary of Mary, Help of Christians, at the same town of Fortín Mercedes.  Blessed  In 2000 a committee of Vatican pathologists declared that the healing of the uterine cancer of a young mother, Valeria Herrera from Córdoba, Argentina, could not be explained medically, with which it was left to Church authorities to decree that it was a miracle due to the intercession of Ceferino Namuncurá. This opened the way for the beatification of Ceferino. Pope Benedict XVI finally decreed his beatification on 6 July 2007.Clarín, 6 July 2007. El Papa declaró beato a Ceferino Namuncurá. The ceremony of beatification was held in Chimpay, Argentina, on November 11, 2007. It was one of the few beatification ceremonies held outside the Vatican and in the blessed's own land; it was the first beatification of a South American aborigine. Blessed Ceferino was beatified by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, a Salesian of Don Bosco and Vatican Secretary of State. The ceremony was attended by more than ten thousand people with the active participation of Mapuche delegations. Ceferino's liturgical calendar memorial as a Catholic beatus was established on August 26.  Legacy of Ceferino  Ceferino Namuncurá's first legacy is to his own nation and people: Argentina and the Mapuche people. There are many books and videos on the life of the young holy man, most of them in Spanish. The meaning of Ceferino is also important to the Mapuche and all South American ancestral peoples. Manuel Gálvez, the prominent Argentine novelist and biographer, wrote a biography of Ceferino Namuncurá in 1947: El Santito de la Toldería. La vida perfecta de Ceferino Namuncurá. Ceferino Namuncura Park, along the Negro River, in Chimpay is named in his honor. Zephyrin: The Musicale Zephyrin: The Musicale is a musical play in honor of Blessed Ceferino Namuncurá. It was shown on March 14, 15 and 16, 2008 at SM Cinema One in Cebu, Philippines. It was written by Jude Thaddeus Gitamondoc and directed by Daisy Brilliantes Ba-ad with the help of Don Bosco Technology Center Productions.The musical was a Salesian Production made in honor of the beatification of Ceferino. The musical featured amateur actors, mostly coming from high school and elementary school. The story begin when Ceferino is only a child and ends after his death.

The Brocklebank–Nelson–Beecher House (circa 1668) is a First Period Colonial house located at 108 East Main Street (Route 133), Georgetown, Massachusetts. It is now a nonprofit museum owned by the Georgetown Historical Society. An admission fee is charged.  History  In 1661, the house's land was granted to Captain Samuel Brocklebank, a surveyor who had come from England in 1638. It is believed that Brocklebank built the house shortly after his marriage in 1668, near a brook where he had kept cattle penned previously. Brocklebank, a captain in the militia, was killed with his entire company in Sudbury in 1676 in a skirmish with Indians during King Philip's War. The house remained within the family until 1754, when it was acquired by Dudley Tyler for use as a tavern, which use continued under Solomon Nelson who purchased the property in 1767. In 1858 the house was bought by Rev Charles Beecher, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher. In 1880 the house was purchased by M. G. Spofford and in 1931 by furniture manufacturer Everett Spaulding, a tenth generation Brocklebank descendant who sold the property to the Society in 1975.  Present description  The original house was extended several times in its early years, and is now a gambrel roofed, 5-bay, center chimney dwelling of early eighteenth-century appearance. A number of items are exhibited within, including many of Capt. Brocklebank's journals. There are also many historically accurate pieces within as well as a display of a small back yard shoe shop.

The chain forms, among others, the border between the Affoltern and Horgen districts. The best known point is Uetliberg at 870 m, overlooking the city of Zürich. Other points of interest include the Albishorn (909m.) the Bürglen (also known as Bürglenstutz, the highest peak, 914.6m.), the Schnabelburg, an observation tower, the Albis Pass, the small town of Buechenegg, and the extensive woods (known as the Sihlwald forest) on both sides of the river Sihl. The Sihl Valley borders the Albis chain on its entire east side. On the west side, the Albis is bordered by various streams (including the Reppisch) and one lake, the Türlersee. The chain is mostly wooded, but also has extensive fields, often reaching to the summit, some cultivated, some used as pastures for cows or sheep. Being very near Zürich, the area is heavily visited, especially near its northern end, and includes many restaurants along the summit (from Uetliberg to Albishorn), well- maintained trails and dirt roads, a railroad (the Uetlibergbahn) from Zürich, and a cable car (Felseneggbahn) from Adliswil to Felsenegg. The Albis chain was formed as the left moraine of the glacier the bed of which is now Lake Zürich. The soil is mostly a conglomerate of gravel, some of it large, and glacial loess. The frequently steep sides of the chain are often subject to small landslides. As a generalization, the eastern side of the chain (overlooking Lake Zürich) tends to be steeper than the western side. The hilltops of the Albis provided several good defensive sites, and were the locations of the castles of Uetliberg, Baldern and Schnabelburg, all of which are now ruined or lost.

The commune was created in the 19th century because of the Industrial Revolution and was named after the Duke of Decazes (1780–1860), the founder of the factory that created the town. History The town is built on coal. La Salle (the former name) produced coal since the 16th century. It was exported in small quantities to Bordeaux. Louis XIV and his successors gave mines to their mistresses. The Duke of Decazes inherited such mines, and in 1826 he created, with the help of a technician named Cabrol, the \\"Houillères et Fonderies de l'Aveyron\\" (Mines and Foundries of Aveyron) which were to make this small village into a center of ironworking. Under Napoléon III, the city took the name of Decazeville, and a statue of Decazes dressed in a Roman toga was erected. The high point of iron production was reached early in the 20th century, with 9000 employees and 1 million tons of steel produced. The production then decreased, and the town has since diversified its industry: metallurgy, woodworking, metal fabrication, and production of steel tubing. Although it felt the full brunt of the decline in the mining industry, the town has much thriving industry. A noted strike of mine workers occurred from 1961 to 1962. Some 1500 miners spent 66 days in the mines from 23 December 1961 to 26 February 1962. The last the mine closed in June 2001. The town has a geological museum named after Pierre Vetter, its founder. It is dedicated to coal strata. The open-pit mine La Découverte is open to the public. The modern church of Notre-Dame has a celebrated painting of the Way of the Cross by Gustave Moreau.

They were known for provocative and political songs. They billed themselves as The First Punk Band Behind The Iron Curtain (one of their songs was titled, Behind the iron curtain old broads pull red beet). They are one of the most important former Yugoslav punk groups and one of the first punk rock bands ever formed in a communist country. Biography Gregor Tomc and Peter Lovšin, two young men from the Ljubljana suburb of Kodeljevo, came up with the idea of forming a band in 1977. From the start, the band was heavily influenced by the UK punk scene. Tomc and Lovšin were the primary songwriters. Lovšin was the lead singer in the band, while Tomc came up with the band name and was the band's manager. The band started playing in the fall of 1977, practicing in the basement of Kodeljevo's music school, and held their first concert at Moste High School. Initially, they played covers of established punk bands including the Sex Pistols, The Clash and New York Dolls. Some of the first original songs by the band that became popular were: \\"Za železno zaveso\\" (Behind The Iron Curtain), \\"Anarhist\\" (Anarchist), and \\"Lublana je bulana\\" (Ljubljana is Sick). They were included in the Novi Punk Val compilation album. They released their first album \\"Dolgcajt\\" (Boredom) in 1980 and gained the status of a cult band all over former Yugoslavia. Their second album “Državni ljubimci” (State Lovers) was highly acclaimed by the public and gained an award for best Yugoslav album of the year. In 1984, they released their Rdeči album (Red Album). The title is an obvious pun on the famous album by The Beatles with the colour red representing symbol of communism. The album featured a cover version of the famous Italian communist revolutionary song Bandiera Rossa (Red Flag), which is one of their most famous tracks. The last Album was Sexpok (1987, ZKP RTVLJ) produced by Tomo in der Muhlen at SIM studio, Zagreb One of their last concerts was in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana in 1987, named Zadnji pogo (The Last Pogo Dance). In 1996, the group temporarily reunited to perform as a support act for the Sex Pistols concert in Ljubljana during their Filthy Lucre Tour. In 2003, Pankrti were included in the 2003 Yugonostalgic Croatian rockumentary Sretno dijete, which deals with the former Yugoslav punk and new wave scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Reunion The band's founding members, Gregor Tomc and Peter Lovšin, who is now a solo artist backed by the band Španski borci (Spanish Republican Fighters), announced Pankrti's reunion concert in the Hall Tivoli for December 1, 2007 as a celebration of their 30th anniversary and it immediately sold out. This show was followed by performances in Serbia and Croatia. These events coincided with the 2007 Sex Pistols reunion for the 30th anniversary of Never Mind The Bollocks.

The mountain offers a panoramic view of the entire city of Zürich and the Lake of Zurich, and lies on the boundary between the city of Zürich and the municipalities of Stallikon and Uitikon. The summit, known as Uto Kulm, is in Stallikon. At the summit, there is the Hotel Uto Kulm, together with two towers. One of these is a look-out tower (access costs , rebuilt 1990), whilst the other is the Uetliberg TV-tower (186 m, rebuilt 1990). The summit is easily accessible by train from Zürich. Uetliberg railway station lies some from, and below, the summit of the Uetliberg. It is the terminus of the Uetliberg line, and is linked to Zürich Hauptbahnhof by S-Bahn Zürich service S10. Trains usually run every half-hour, taking 20 minutes. There are numerous walking paths leading up to the top from Albisgüetli, Triemli or Albisrieden with frequent water fountains and camping spots. Uetliberg also has a downhill mountain bike track which starts in the camping area at the top of the mountain and finishes next to Triemli railway station, also served by the S10. A panoramic footpath leads along the crest of the Albis ridge to Felsenegg, from where the Adliswil-Felsenegg cable car connects to Adliswil and the S4 S-Bahn service in the valley below. The Uetliberg gives its name to the Zürich-based Uto section of the Swiss Alpine Club, and hence to the Uto Peak in the Selkirk Mountains of Canada, which was first climbed by members of the Uto section.

History Until 1916 the camp housed German prisoners of war in an abandoned distillery and crude huts, but in the wake of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, the German prisoners were moved and it was used as a place of internment for approximately 1,800 Irish prisoners, among them such notables as Michael Collins. They were accorded the status of prisoners of war. Among the prisoners were the future Hollywood actor Arthur Shields and sportsman and referee Thomas Burke. It is a common misconception that Éamon de Valera was also imprisoned at Frongoch.During this time de Valera was held at Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons. The camp became a fertile seeding ground for spreading the ideology of the Irish rebels, with inspired organisers such as Michael Collins giving impromptu lessons in guerrilla tactics. Later the camp became known as ollscoil na réabhlóide, the \\"University of Revolution\\". Lord Decies was appointed as Chief Press Censor for Ireland after the Rising in 1916, and he warned the press to be careful about what they published. William O'Brien's Cork Free Press was one of the first papers he suppressed under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 (DORA regulations) after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners at the camp.Peter Martin Censorship in the two Irelands 1922-39, Introduction p.9, Irish Academic Press (2008) The camp was emptied in December 1916 when David Lloyd George replaced H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister. The local school Ysgol Bro Tryweryn now stands on the site of the former camp but a commemorative plaque stands nearby, with inscriptions in Irish, Welsh and English. In 2016, the hundredth anniversary of the internment of Irish prisoners at Frongoch, the local community organized a number of commemoration events and the history of the camp was widely reported.

Life He was born at Oletzko, in East Prussia, on 26 February 1813. From his father, the magistrate of the town, a stubborn and incorruptible patriot, he received an education well calculated to develop the independence of mind and strength of body for which he was remarkable all his life. After a somewhat stormy career at the university of Königsberg, he successively obtained several minor situations in the magistracy, and devoted himself to the study of statistics and political economy. His inquiries, combined with the restless temper which always made official life distasteful to him, led him to adopt advanced democratic opinions, which, freely manifested during the Revolutions of 1848, cost him his post in the civil service upon the triumph of the reaction. After assisting in Gottfried Kinkel's remarkable escape from Spandau Prison, be determined to emigrate to California, whither he proceeded in 1850. The incidents of his voyage and residence were most adventurous. He caught yellow fever on the passage out, was robbed, while unconscious, of all his property, arrived at San Francisco half dead, and owed his life to the charity of a woman. Having also recovered from an attack of cholera, he betook himself to the wilderness, and lived for some time the life of a hunter. He saw much of the operations of the vigilance committee, which he subsequently vividly described in Household Words. In 1851, he returned to Europe, and for several years led a peripatetic life, seeking employment alternately as a tutor and as a man of letters. In 1857, he formed the resolution of devoting himself to English history, and settled in London with the view of studying the period of the Tudors. Finding the materials in the English Record Office insufficient, he conceived the bold plan of establishing himself at Simancas, and making a thorough examination of the Archivo General de Simancas, at that time exceedingly difficult of access. Before Bergenroth no more than six students, Spanish and foreign, had made any important research in the archives, and it was generally believed that great havoc had been committed among them by the French soldiers, which Bergenroth found reason to doubt. The history of his investigations is most graphically narrated by himself in letters to the Athenæum, and in private communications to Sir John Romilly, master of the rolls, who was induced by the Athenæum letters to procure Bergenroth a commission with a stipend from the English government. He speedily manifested the most remarkable talent as a decipherer, interpreting more than twelve ciphers of exceeding difficulty, with which the Spanish archivists were themselves unacquainted, or the keys to which they withheld from him. Their persistent obstruction compelled him to have recourse to the English embassy at Madrid; but his energy triumphed over every obstacle, and in 1862 he was enabled to publish a calendar of the documents in the Simancas Archives relating to English affairs from 1485 to 1509, with additions from the repositories at Brussels, Barcelona, and other places. This calendar was introduced by a fascinating preface, describing his difficulties and successes as a decipherer, and including a brilliant review of the relations between England and Spain during the period. Bergenroth was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1867.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory A second and larger volume appeared in 1868, analysing the documents from 1509 to 1525. While labouring indefatigably at the Simancas records, he was attacked by an epidemic fever, of which he died at Madrid on 13 February 1869. He examined in Simancas, in Spain, under great privations, papers on the period in the public archives, made of these a collection and published it in 1862-1868, under the title of Calendar of Letters, Despatches, &c.;, relating to Negotiations between England and Spain. *Bergenroth bio Works  References ;Attribution Further reading * * Ursula Naumann: El Caballero Gustavo Bergenroth.

Consecrated a bishop in 1058, he was deposed in 1070 for unknown reasons and then imprisoned by King William I of England. He was considered one of the best legal experts of his time, and was even brought from his prison to attend the trial on Penenden Heath where he gave testimony about English law before the Norman Conquest of England. Early life Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury prior to his becoming a bishop.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 198 Several historians opine that he might have been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead.Barlow Godwins p. 56Mason House of Godwine p. 93 The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes the fact that he was felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.Walker Harold p. 203 Æthelric was consecrated bishop in 1058 by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 5: Chichester: Bishops Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand, unlike most of the English bishops of the time period, because at that point, Stigand held a valid pallium, or symbol of an archbishop's authority and ability to consecrate bishops.Walker Harold pp. 137-138 Deposition Æthelric was deposed by the Council of Windsor on 24 May 1070 and imprisoned at Marlborough, being replaced by Stigand (not the same as the archbishop), who later moved the seat of the diocese to Chichester. It is possible, that his deposition was tied to the fact that about that time, King Harold of England's mother and sister took refuge with the count of Flanders. If Æthelric was related to the Godwin's, King William I of England may have feared that the bishop would use his diocese to launch a rebellion.Walker Harold p. 193 Other reasons put forward include the fact that Æthelric had been consecrated by Stigand, but the other bishop that Stigand had consecrated, Siward the Bishop of Rochester was not deposed. Æthelric was a monk, and while not having a great reputation for sanctity, he was not held to be immoral either.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 105 The pope did not feel that his deposition had been handled correctly,Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 661 so his deposition was confirmed at the Council of Winchester on 1 April 1076. It continued to be considered uncanonical, but Æthelric was never restored to his bishopric.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 46 Penenden Heath Æthelric was carted from imprisonment to the Trial of Penenden Heath of Odo of Bayeux, earl of Kent. This took place sometime between 1072 and 1076.O'Brien \\"Forgery and the Literacy\\" Albion p. 10 At that time, he was the most prominent legalist in England.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 347Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 107 He helped clarify Anglo-Saxon land laws, as the trial was concerned with the attempts of Lanfranc to recover lands from Odo.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 182 The medieval writer Eadmer also consulted Æthelric for information on Eadmer's Life of St Dunstan.Walker Harold p. 95 Presumably Æthelric died soon after the trial, as he was already an old man when he attended the trial.Bates William the Conqueror p. 153 NoteCitationsReferences     Further reading * * External links * Category:1070s deaths Category:Bishops of Selsey Category:11th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Æthelric II"},{"id":"2767767","text":"Colomb is a surname which may refer to: * Friedrich August Peter von Colomb (1775-1854), Prussian general * George Thomas Colomb (1787–1874), British Army general and talented amateur artist * Georges Colomb (1856–1945), French botanist, science populariser and pioneer of French comics * Gregory G.

When introduced in 1991, the A-series trains became the first electric passenger trains to operate in Western Australia and until 2004, were the only type of train in use on the Perth suburban rail network. History Studies for the electrification of Perth's suburban rail network began in 1984 and in 1988 43 two-car electric railcars were ordered from Walkers Limited, Maryborough. Prior to this, Perth's rail transport network consisted of three railway lines radiating from Perth and operated by a mixture of diesel railcars and diesel locomotive hauled trains. In 1979, one of these lines, the Fremantle line, was closed but reopened in 1983 following a change in State Government. The trains were transported across the continent on standard gauge bogies and converted to Western Australia's gauge standard locally. The first set, set 01, arrived in September 1990 and immediately became the subject of industrial action at Westrail's Midland Railway Workshops over a pay dispute and the impending one- man train operation which the new trains would ensure. Testing of the new trains began soon afterwards and mostly on the Armadale line while the electrification process continued. While the trials were largely successful a number of negative points were noted, not the least of which were braking issues and the creation of a harmonic vibration from the train's bogies which caused nausea in otherwise healthy passengers. The trains entered revenue service on the 28 September 1991, running Perth Royal Show specials and by April 1992 had virtually taken over the suburban network timetables, with only a very limited number of services still operated by the older diesel trains. The last entered service on 30 October 1992. Some sets have been named: *01 City of Perth named 11 April 1992 *02 City of Armadale named 11 April 1992 *03 Shire of Swan named 11 April 1992 *04 City of Fremantle named 11 April 1992 *05 City of Wanneroo named 21 March 1993 *43 City of Maryborough named 30 October 1993 The new trains revolutionised the commuter services on the Perth network, but their success was marred by project delays and a number of early accidents. Some of those accidents involved collisions with motor vehicles at unprotected level crossings, the increased speed and quieter operation as opposed to the older, slower and louder, diesel trains being considered as a contributing factor. In three accidents within the first twelve months of operations three fatalities - all in motor vehicles - were suffered. Other accidents did not involve loss of life and some, such as a collision between sets while shunting at the train depot at Claisebrook, meant that some sets were mixed while their other half underwent repairs. Several months in 1993, for instance, saw the pairings of AEA226 and AEB339, and AEA217 and AEB326. When repairs were completed the original set combinations were restored. Additionally, a number of teething troubles soon presented themselves, such as braking problems which meant that trains would sometimes fail to stop in the space required and thus not be correctly positioned at the station platforms. These problems were eventually overcome and the type has provided stable service ever since. In April 1997, a further five were ordered, entering service in 1998/99.New Suburban Trains for Brisbane and Perth Railway Digest June 1997 page 14 These sets introduced longitudinal seating and the current green Transperth livery to the fleet, and with detail improvements including internal information panels, extra security cameras and quieter wheel motors, were subsequently dubbed 'second generation' sets. They are externally identical. Some of the first generation trains were then progressively updated to bring them inline with the more recent units. All are scheduled to be replaced by C-series from 2023.Made in WA: Metronet railcars to be proudly built in WA Minister for Transport 18 August 2019Alstom to supply next generation of EMUs to Perth Metro Report International 20 August 2019 Photograph of original A Series Cab in September 1990 Configuration Each set consists of two semi-permanently coupled cars, designated AEA and AEB, both of which have a driver’s cab and powered bogies. Up to three sets may be coupled together to make a six-car train, although common practice is to operate them only as either two- or four-car set consists. There are currently 48 two-car A-series trains in operation. Originally, the majority of A-series trains featured two inward-facing rows of bench seats either side of the car forward of the front set of doors and to the back of the rear set of doors, with two-seat rows running down each side of the car in between the doors. In this configuration each car has the capacity to carry 72 seated and 82 standing passengers, giving unmodified the A-series trains a total capacity of 308. However, since 2010, all sets have been reconfigured with two inward- facing bench rows running the entire length of the car. This reduces the number of seats available but increases standing room capacity. Each car has 1-2 wheelchair spaces available. Upgrades Over time the A Series has had many upgrades, Those include new External Destination Indicators (EDI) and Internal Passenger Information Displays (PID), Passenger Emergency Intercom (PEI), USB Charging and Onboard Public Address System for controlling Announcements which were designed and supplied by COMRAIL http://comrail.com.au/index.html. Upgrades to the traction/brake traction controllers were made by retrofitting the fleet with a controller similar to those found in the B Series. The controllers improved operation comfort and control reliability, As the older controller design caused discomfort to the driver if used for long periods of time and suffered from a very \\"Notchy and inconsistent\\" feel when changing between traction and brake levels. https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf#page=147https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf In Service The A-series trains mainly runs on the Fremantle, Midland, and Armadale/Thornlie lines. Until early-2011, the Joondalup and Mandurah lines were also serviced by 12 two-car A-series trains at high-demand periods. They are now exclusively serviced by newer B-Series trains. C-Series trains are also planned to be built from 2020 to accommodate rail network expansion under the Metronet program. =USB Charging Ports= The USB charging ports on A-Series Sets 43 and 44 In early-2016, A-Series Sets 43 and 44 were fitted by COMRAIL http://comrail.com.au/home_002.htmwith USB charging ports as part of a 6-month trial which was deemed successful.

It is the only member of the genus Heloxycanus. This species is endemic to New Zealand. It has been classified as having the status of \\"At Risk, Declining\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described in 1994 by John S. Dugdale using a specimen collected by Brian Patrick at Dansey Pass on 8 April 1979. The species is named for its discoverer. The holotype specimen for this species is held at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.  Description  The wingspan of the female moth is 48–55mm while the male moth is between 40–45mm. There is a variation in colouration between the southern population in comparison to the northern and western populations. The southern population is more smokey brown in colour with a reduced forewing stripe and a shorter antenna segment at the apex. The other populations are a more yellowish-fawn colour with a distinctive white stripe on the forewings.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. It can be found in the following regions: the Otago Lakes, Central Otago, Dunedin, Southland, Fiordland and Stewart Island.  Biology and behaviour  H. patricki has a life cycle that runs in two year cycles with peak numbers of adults occurring in odd-numbered years. This species is semiaquatic. Larvae are believed to feed on moss rhizoids. After the adult moths emerge their pupae cases can be found sticking up from the moss. H. patricki are a late autumn emerging moth. They generally begin to emerge in late March and are finished by mid-June although in Otago the emergence times are between mid-April and early June.  Habitat  This moth is found in coastal and alpine moss bogs, mires and blanket bogs, peatland, and in Sphagnum bogs in the southern part of New Zealand.  Conservation Status  This species has been classified as having the \\"At Risk, Declining\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. This classification results from the species' limited ability to disperse, its restrictive distribution to the southern part of New Zealand, and habitat loss.

Life and career He was born William Osgood in London, England, in 1754 to William Osgood (died 1767). His family was Methodist and John Wesley recounted on Sunday, 13 December 1767 that \\"I was desired to preach a funeral sermon for William Osgood. He came to London nearly thirty years ago, and from nothing increased more and more, till he was worth several thousands of pounds. He was a good man, and died in peace. Nevertheless, I believe his money was a great clog to him, and kept him in a poor, low state all his days, making no such advance as he might have done, either in holiness or happiness.\\" He attended Christ Church, Oxford and was called to the bar in 1779. On December 31, 1791, he was appointed first Chief Justice of Upper Canada. Although he mainly sought the opinions of lawyers from England, Osgoode attempted to adapt the English civil law of the time to fit the needs of a developing colony. For example, he allowed justices of the peace to perform marriages when Anglican priests were not readily available. Osgoode's Judicature Act of 1794 established a system of district courts and a superior provincial court. During his term, legislation was also introduced to abolish slavery. Osgoode also served as a member of John Graves Simcoe's Executive Council for Upper Canada. He also served as Speaker of the Legislative Council (the upper house of the Assembly) in both Upper Canada and Lower Canada. In 1794, he became Chief Justice of Lower Canada. Osgoode came into conflict with Governor Robert Prescott over an attempt to sort out the issue of land grants in the region. When Prescott was recalled, he came into conflict with Prescott's successor, Lieutenant Governor Robert Shore Milnes. In 1801, Osgoode resigned and returned to London. He became a member of the Royal Commission on the Courts of Law and help form what eventually led to the Uniformity of Process Act in 1832. Unmarried, Osgoode died in London in 1824 and is buried in St. Mary's Church, Harrow-on-the-Hill. Osgoode Hall, the location of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the headquarters of the Law Society of Ontario, was named after him, as was Osgoode Hall Law School.

Among other accomplishments, Mair has edited the standard Columbia History of Chinese Literature and the Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature. Mair is the series editor of the Cambria Sinophone World Series (Cambria Press), and his book coauthored with Miriam Robbins Dexter (published by Cambria Press), Sacred Display: Divine and Magical Female Figures of Eurasia, won the Sarasvati Award for the Best Nonfiction Book in Women and Mythology. Life and career Victor H. Mair was born on March 25, 1943, in East Canton, Ohio. After high school, Mair attended Dartmouth College, where, in addition to his studies, he was a member of the Dartmouth Big Green men's basketball team. He graduated with an A.B. in 1965, then joined the Peace Corps and served in Nepal for two years. After leaving the Peace Corps in 1967, Mair returned to the United States and enrolled in the Buddhist Studies program at the University of Washington, where he began studying Buddhism, Sanskrit, and Classical Tibetan.Science Hotline - Dead Men's Tales: Victor Mair, PBS - Scientific American. In 1968, Mair won a Marshall Scholarship and moved to the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London to further study Chinese and Sanskrit, receiving a B.A. (Hons) in 1972 and an M.Phil. in 1974. He then went to Harvard University to pursue doctoral studies in Chinese under the New Zealander scholar Patrick Hanan. He received a Ph.D. in 1976 with a doctoral dissertation entitled \\"Popular Narratives From Tun-huang\\", a study and translation of folk literature discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts. After completing his Ph.D., Mair joined the faculty at Harvard as an assistant professor and taught there for three years. In 1979, Mair left Harvard to join the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, where he has remained ever since. He is also founder and editor of Sino-Platonic Papers, an academic journal examining Chinese, East Asian and Central Asian linguistics and literature. Mair specializes in early written vernacular Chinese, and is responsible for translations of the Dao De Jing (the Mawangdui Silk Texts version), the Zhuangzi and The Art of War. He has also collaborated on interdisciplinary research on the archeology of Eastern Central Asia. The American Philosophical Society awarded him membership in 2007. In 1969, Mair married Chang Li-ch'ing (; 1936-2010), a Chinese-Taiwanese scholar who taught Mandarin Chinese at the University of Washington, Tunghai University, Bryn Mawr College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Swarthmore College.Li-ching Chang, 1936-2010, Pinyin News. Together they had one son, Thomas Krishna Mair. Three of Mair's former students characterize his wide-ranging scholarship. > Victor has always cast his nets widely, and he could routinely amaze us with > observations far afield from the Chinese text we were reading in class. > Today people often attempt to simulate this cosmopolitanism under the rubric > of interdisciplinary study, but for Victor, it was quite untrendy: he simply > had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and pushing boundaries.

(Boucher, Schmid, and Sen > 2006:1) Mair is a contributor to the linguistics blog Language Log.Language Log posts by Victor Mair Pinyin advocacy Mair is a long-time advocate for writing Mandarin Chinese in an alphabetic script (viz., pinyin), which he considers advantageous for Chinese education, computerization, and lexicography. In the first issue of Sino-Platonic papers (1986), he suggested the publication of a Chinese dictionary arranged in the same familiar way as English, French, or Korean dictionaries: \\"single-sort alphabetical arrangement\\" purely based on the alphabetic spelling of a word, regardless of its morphological structure. Most Chinese words are multisyllabic compounds, where each syllable or morpheme is written with a single Chinese character. Following a two-millennia tradition, Chinese dictionaries – even modern pinyin-based ones like the Xinhua Zidian – are regularly ordered in \\"sorted-morpheme arrangement\\" based on the first morpheme (character) in a word. For instance, a Chinese dictionary user who wanted to look up the word Bābāduōsī 巴巴多斯 \\"Barbados\\" could find it under ba 巴 in traditional sorted- morpheme ordering (which is easier if one knows the character's appearance or radical but not its pronunciation) or under baba in single-sort alphabetic ordering (which is easier if one knows the pronunciation). In 1990, after unsuccessfully trying to obtain financial support for an alphabetically collated Chinese-English dictionary, Mair organized an international team of linguists and lexicographers who were willing to work as part-time volunteers. Under the editorial leadership of John DeFrancis, they published the first general Chinese-English single-sort dictionary in 1996.

Life Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, the English church was gradually restructured along the lines of the episcopal organization in Normandy. As part of this process, almost all of the Anglo-Saxon bishops of English sees were replaced by Normans. Archbishop Stigand of Canterbury was deposed in 1070, accused of holding the archiepiscopal see in plurality with the bishopric of Winchester and of having seizing the archepiscopate irregularly after the flight of his predecessor Robert of Jumièges. Æthelric II of Selsey was deposed from his episcopate at the same time, probably because of his association with Archbishop Stigand.Kelly \\"Bishopric of Selsey\\" in Hobbs Chichester Cathedral p. 9 King William's chaplain, who was also called Stigand, replaced Æthelric as Bishop of Selsey within a week of Æthelric's deposition. Stigand was listed as an assisting bishop at the consecration of Lanfranc to the archbishopric of Canterbury on 29 August 1070; therefore Stigand must have been appointed as bishop prior to that date.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 5: Chichester: Bishops At the Council of London in 1075 the South Saxon see was transferred to Chichester.Barlow English Church p. 48 Some sources claim that Stigand continued to use the title Bishop of Selsey until 1082, before adopting the new title of Bishop of Chichester, indicating that the transfer took several years to complete.Dallaway History of the Western Division of the county of Sussex, Volume 1 p. 25 The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury said, in Gesta pontificum Anglorum, that there had been a monastery dedicated to St Peter, as well as a convent in Chichester.William of Malmesbury Gesta Pontificum Anglorum book 2, chapter 96 Presumably the minister became the new seat of the diocese with the cathedral sharing its site with that of the parish church. It was probably after the rebuilding of the cathedral in the 12th century that the parishioners were assigned the nave altar, this was known as the sub-deanery church of St. Peter the Great. They were then moved, at the end of the 15th century, to the north transept of the cathedral and remained there until the 19th century when a new parish church was built adjacent to the cathedral and dedicated to St Peter.Foster Chichester Cathedral Spire p. 17Salzman Chichester: Advowsons pp. 164-166 Traditionally, the building of the cathedral has been credited to one of Stigand's successors, Ralph de Luffa, but the architectural historian R. D. H. Gem argues it is possible that Stigand began the building of Chichester Cathedral.Gem \\"Chichester Cathedral\\" Proceedings of the Battle Conference Volume III pp. 61-64 Tatton-Brown goes further by suggesting that \\"most of the first church was completed as far as the fourth bay in the nave by the time of Bishop Luffa\\".Tatton-Brown \\"Medieval Fabric\\" Chichester Cathedral p. 27 and footnote 11 The problem for historians is that virtually no legitimate charters or other documents survive from Stigand's time.Mayr-Harting \\"Introduction\\" Acta p. 5 The loss of most of the documents has been attributed to the sacking of the cathedral by the Parliamentarians in 1642, during the English Civil War.McCann \\"Archives\\" in Hobbs Chichester Cathedral p. 190 The cathedral, probably planned during Stigand's tenure, consisted of an eight-bay nave with flanking western towers; however evidence from the fabric shows that only the eastern four bays were built in the first phase.Tatton-Brown \\"Medieval Fabric\\" in Hobbs Chichester Cathedral p. 25 Dispute with the King and Archbishop The organization of the Chichester diocese into prebends may have begun under Stigand.Hudson Land, Law, and Lordship p. 235 Stigand's organisational skills brought him into conflict with Lanfranc over the archbishops' peculiars in Sussex, which were numerous.Stephens Memorials of the See of Chichester p. 46 Lanfranc wrote a letter to Stigand instructing him not to meddle with the Sussex parishes belonging to the see of Canterbury and he also prohibited any of the clergy in those peculiars from attending Stigand's diocesan synods. Stigand also managed to attract the displeasure of King William I. William had selected a monk from Marmoutier Abbey to be the first abbot of Battle Abbey. The king had requested that Stigand travel to Battle to consecrate the new abbot; however, Stigand refused and insisted that the abbot elect instead travel to Chichester to be consecrated. The king was incensed and compelled Stigand to go to Battle to consecrate the monk before the altar of St. Martin. The abbey was to remain outside Stigand's jurisdiction and to become part of the king's own chapel. As a further humiliation, Stigand and his retinue were forbidden to be lodged or boarded within the grounds of the abbey on the occasion of the consecration.Stephens Memorials of the See of Chichester p. 45 Stigand remained Bishop of Chichester until his death in 1087, possibly on 29 August.Fryde, et al.

He was brought up in New York but moved to Ireland at the age of 14. He primarily resides there. Approach to comedy Bishop's comedy was originally based heavily on his observations of Irish society, supported by his talent for mimicking the regional variations of the Irish accent. His website says, \\"Des has developed a unique style of observational comedy, most critical of his adopted home in Ireland and the America he left behind.\\" www.desbishop.com Bishop's comedy has since grappled with social issues, such as poverty. In 2000, Bishop was diagnosed with testicular cancer; rather than shy away from this subject, Des went on to turn his experiences into comedy material. Life and career Bishop has worked as a comic in Ireland since the late 1990s. He began hosting shows at the International Comedy Cellar - a venue set up by Irish comics such as Ardal O'Hanlon, Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy. It was here that Bishop honed his act. Bishop first reached a TV audience in early 2000, after appearing on Don't Feed the Gondolas, a news based topical TV show. He later had to pull out of this show due to personal reasons. Bishop created a \\"hip-hopera\\" called \\"RAP ÉIRE\\" along with Arthur Riordan. \\"Rap Éire\\" was a satire following the story of an ambitious American who finds himself mixed up with a group of political types during the throes of early Celtic Tiger fervour. The show had two runs - firstly in the Project Arts centre in February 2001 and afterwards in the Andrews Lane Theatre the following summer. Bishop performed every night of the first run while receiving radiotherapy for testicular Cancer (the original premier date for the play at the Dublin Fringe Festival 2000 had to be cancelled as a result of the original diagnosis of cancer). Bishop appeared in the 2002 film In America, in which he played a high stockbroker rapping in the back of a NYC taxi cab. He reached a broader audience after his TV show The Des Bishop Work Experience screened on RTÉ Two in 2004. The show featured him attempting to survive for one month working a minimum wage job in various parts of Ireland. During the series, he worked at Abrakebabra, Waterford; The Aqua-dome, Tralee; Superquinn, Dundalk; and the Central Hotel, Dublin. A more recent TV show, named Joy in the Hood, featured him travelling to deprived areas of Ireland's major cities and mentoring local people in stand-up comedy. Bishop and Riordan co-wrote \\"Shooting Gallery\\", their second collaboration. This had a short run in Dublin in 2005. Bishop speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and has also worked in China where he has adopted the Chinese stage name Bi Hansheng (毕瀚生) and has appeared in a few Chinese dating shows. Personal and family Bishop attended St. Francis Preparatory School in the Fresh Meadows neighbourhood of the New York City borough of Queens.Interview of Des Bishop by Al Roker. Today Show.

Life Phylarchus was a contemporary of Aratus, in the 3rd century BC. His birthplace is doubtful. In the Suda it is stated that three different cities are mentioned as his native place: Athens, Naucratis in Egypt, or Sicyon; Athenaeus calls him an Athenian or Naucratian. Respecting the date of Phylarchus there is less uncertainty. Polybius writes that Phylarchus was a contemporary of Aratus, and gave an account of the same events as the latter did in his history. Aratus died 213 BC, and his work ended at 220 BC, therefore placing Phylarchus at about 215 BC. His influence The credit of Phylarchus as an historian is vehemently attacked by Polybius, who charges him with falsifying history through his partiality to Cleomenes III, king of Sparta, and his hatred against Aratus and the Achaeans. The accusation of Polybius is repeated by Plutarch, but it comes with rather a bad grace from the latter writer, since there can be little doubt that his lives of Agis and Cleomenes are taken almost entirely from Phylarchus, to whom he is likewise indebted for the latter part of his life of Pyrrhus. The vivid and graphic style of Phylarchus was well suited to Plutarch's purpose. It has likewise been remarked that Pompeius Trogus took from Phylarchus that portion of his work which treated of the same times as were contained in the history of Phylarchus. That Plutarch and Trogus borrowed almost the very words of Phylarchus, appears from a comparison of Justin, xxviii. 4, with Plutarch's Cleomenenes, 29. His style The style of Phylarchus is strongly censured by Polybius, who blames him for writing history for the purpose of effect, and for seeking to harrow up the feelings of his readers by the narrative of deeds of violence and horror. This charge is to some extent supported by the fragments of his work; but whether he deserves all the reprehension which Polybius has bestowed upon him may well be questioned, since the unpoetical character of this great historian's mind would not enable him to feel much sympathy with a writer like Phylarchus, who seems to have possessed no small share of imagination and fancy. It would appear that the style of Phylarchus was too ambitious; it was oratorical, and perhaps declamatory; but at the same time it was lively and attractive, and brought the events of the history vividly before the reader's mind. He was, however, very negligent in the arrangement of his words, as Dionysius has remarked. His known works The following six works are attributed to Phylarchus by the Suda: — * Histories (Iστoριαι), in 28 books, which were by far the most important of his writings. This work is thus described by the Suda: — \\"The expedition of Pyrrhus of Epirus against the Peloponnese in 28 books; and it comes down to Ptolemy who was called Euergetes, and to the end of Berenice, and as far as Cleomenes the Spartan, against whom Antigonus made war.\\" When the Suda entitles it \\"the expedition of Pyrrhus, &c.;\\" he merely describes the first event in the work. The expedition of Pyrrhus into the Peloponnese was in 272 BC; the death of Cleomenes in 220 BC: the work therefore embraced a period of fifty-two years. From some of the fragments of the work which have been preserved, it has been conjectured by some writers that Phylarchus commenced at an earlier period, perhaps as early as the death of Alexander the Great. The work gave the history not only of Greece and Macedonia, but likewise of Aegypt, Cyrene, and the other states of the time; and in narrating the history of Greece, Phylarchus paid particular attention to that of Cleomenes and the Spartans. * The story of Antiochus and Eumenes of Pergamum (Tα κατα τoν Aντιoχoν και τoν Περγαμηνoν Eυμενη), was probably a portion of the preceding work, since the war between the Attalid Eumenes I and the Seleucid Antiochus I Soter was hardly of sufficient importance to give rise to a separate history, and that between Eumenes II and Antiochus III the Great was subsequent to the time of Phylarchus. * Epitome of myth on the apparition of Zeus, was one work, although cited by the Suda as two: the general title was Epitome mythike, and that of the first part Peri tes tou Dios epiphaneias. * On discoveries, on which subject Ephorus and Philochorus also wrote. * Digressions. * Agrapha, not mentioned by the Suda, and only by the Scholiast on Aelius Aristides, was probably a work on the more abstruse points of mythology, of which no written account had ever been given.

He is known for mixing popular folkloric genres with Argentinian rock and roll, and lyrics with social and political connotations. This has led to him being called \\"The Argentine Bob Dylan\\". Biography Leon Gieco was born into a family of Italian origin on November 20, 1951 in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. At 6 years old, Gieco traveled with his family from the field to the village center due to economic problems. At age 8, Gieco bought his first guitar on credit, and soon began playing music at local events with his father's band. Throughout his childhood, Gieco played with local bands such as a folkloric group called Los Nocheros (The Night Watchers) and Los Moscos (The Flies), a rock band that gained some popularity within Argentina. In 1965, Gieco traveled to Bolivia as an exchange student. He studied music and played guitar at local festivities. When Gieco turned 18, he went to Buenos Aires to become a full-time musician. There, he took guitar lessons from Gustavo Santaolalla, who introduced him to important people in the Buenos Aires musical community, such as Raúl Porchetto, Charly García, Nito Mestre, and María Rosa Yorio, future members along with Gieco of the Argentine supergroup, Porsuigieco. Gieco was given the opportunity to perform in the Buenos Aires Rock Festival in 1971, 1972, and 1973. In 1973, he recorded his first album, \\"Leon Gieco\\" ( it was recorded independently with Santaolalla). \\"En el País de la Libertad\\" (\\"In the Country of Freedom\\"), a hit from his album, demonstrated Gieco's concern for change in Argentina, his concern for social justice. In 1976 Gieco released El Fantasma de Canterville (\\"The Ghost of Canterville\\"). The record suffered a great deal of censorship from the military government forcing him to change the lyrics of 6 songs and remove 3 others altogether. Nevertheless, the record was a success, and he had concerts not only around Argentina, but also in other countries of South America. Two years later he released IV LP, with one of his most famous songs: \\"Sólo le pido a Dios\\" (\\"I only ask of God\\"). Due to the political situation in Argentina, Gieco moved to Los Angeles, California in 1978 for one year. On December 20, 1979, the Argentine Minister of Education announced the closing of the National University of Lujan in Buenos Aires. Gieco participated in a protest against the closing by singing \\"La Cultura es la Sonrisa\\". His lyrics say, \\"(Culture) only cries in a country where people can't choose it/it only cries its sadness if a minister closes a school...\\" In 1981 Gieco started a 3-year, 110,000-kilometre-long series of independent concerts all over Argentina, playing for a total of 420,000 people. He gathered material from the different places he visited during the tour, and recorded the first volume of De Ushuaia a La Quiaca (\\"From Ushuaia to La Quiaca\\" in Buenos Aires with various autochthonous musicians in 1985. The following De Ushuaia a La Quiaca 2 and De Ushuaia a La Quiaca 3 were recorded in a mobile studio in different locations of the country. In 1985, Gieco went to Moscow for the 12th \\"World Youth and Students' Festival\\" alongside Juan Carlos Baglietto and Litto Nebbia, representing Argentina. In 1986 and 1987, he held concerts in Germany with his friend Mercedes Sosa, including that of Berlin's Political Song Festival. Gieco returned to Argentina and performed free concerts, one for 40,000 spectators at the National Flag Memorial in Rosario, and the other for 35,000 people in Buenos Aires. At Boca Juniors' Stadium he had a concert with Pablo Milanés and Chico Buarque, and guest musicians Mercedes Sosa, Fito Páez, Nito Mestre, Juan Carlos Baglietto and Sixto Palavecino. At the end of the year he went on a world tour that included countries such as Mexico, Peru, Brasil, Sweden, Germany and Denmark. In 1988, Gieco performed in Germany and Austria. Back in Argentina he participated in the final concert of the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour at River Plate Stadium, with Charly García, Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, and others. After eight years of touring, Semillas del corazón (\\"Seeds of the heart\\") marked his return to the studio in 1989. That same year he performed at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires with United States folk legend Pete Seeger. The following year, Seeger asked him to join a tour that took him to Washington, D.C., Boston and New York City. There he played with David Byrne, whom he had met in Buenos Aires shortly before. In 1992, he played with Milton Nascimento, Mercedes Sosa, Os Paralamas do Sucesso, Gilberto Gil and Rubén Rada at the inauguration of the Latin American Parliament in São Paulo. In 1997 he participated in the memorial concert for the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, with bands such as Divididos, La Renga, Los Piojos, and Attaque 77. Gieco began his most recent national tour for social justice, Mundo Alas, in 2007. Argentine musicians, dancers, singers, and painters, all with disabilities, performed alongside Gieco, expressing their unique talents and communicating with audiences. He gave these artists the opportunity to live out their dreams as he does. Gieco created a documentary from the road tour which was produced in March, 2009. The film features rock music, folk music, and tango, along with Gieco's original hits. During his stop in Buenos Aires on his 2013 Wrecking Ball World Tour, Bruce Springsteen filmed a video for a solo acoustic performance of \\"Sólo le Pido a Dios\\".

Regarded as one of the most influential reggae bassists, Shakespeare is also known for his creative use of electronics and production effects units. He is sometimes nicknamed \\"Basspeare\\".Hansen, Adam. Shakespeare and Popular Music. Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep. 23, 2010. p. 143. As a part of Sly and Robbie, Shakespeare worked with various reggae artist such as U-Roy, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Sugar Minott, Augustus Pablo, Yellowman and Black Uhuru. His production work also extended beyond the reggae genre, covering various pop and rock artists such as Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, Cyndi Lauper, Joe Cocker, Yoko Ono, Serge Gainsbourg and Grace Jones. Prior to his involvement in Sly and Robbie, he was a member of the session groups The Revolutionaries and The Aggrovators. Career Shakespeare grew up in East Kingston, Jamaica. He had a musical family, so that \\"his family home was a rehearsal and hangout spot for a variety of upcoming musicians and singers.\\" His brother Lloyd had a band called the Emotions which rehearsed in the house. Shakespeare's first instrument was an acoustic guitar that was always present in the home. Later, the band Familyman came into his yard, as it was near a popular location for selling marijuana. Shakespeare had been trying acoustic guitar and drums, but when he heard Familyman's bass player, he was attracted to the deep bass sound. Shakespeare recalled saying \\"I wan fi learn how to play this thing [bass]. You haffi teach me\\". Even though Familyman's bassist insisted that he was just learning the instrument himself, he agreed to give Shakespeare bass lessons. Shakespeare first went in a music studio when he helped carry his brother Carlie's drums into the studio and set up the drums. This developed into sneaking into the studio and waiting outside as bands recorded. Whenever Familyman recorded, Shakespeare would try to both listen to the session and watch the bass player's hands; then afterwards, the bassist would show Shakespeare the basslines that had been recorded in person at Shakespeare's family house. Shakespeare then studied electric bass with Aston Barrett, the bass player from the Upsetters.The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll. Third Edition. Edited by Holly George-Warren and Patricia Romanowski. Fireside, a Rolling Stone Press Book. London. 2001 He collaborated with the drummer Sly Dunbar for the first time when they played in the Channel One Studio house band, which was called The Revolutionaries. After Barrett joined the Wailers, Shakespeare took over the bass role in Barrett's former group, Hippy Boys. In 1974, Shakespeare and Dunbar started an independent music production company and record label called Taxi Records.

Its stated mission is \\"to champion great design that improves lives and makes things better\\". It was instrumental in the promoting of the concept of inclusive design. The Design Council's archive is located at the University of Brighton Design Archives.The University of Brighton Design Archives: Design Council Archive The Design Council operates two subsidiaries, the Design Council Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Design Council CABE) and Design Council Enterprises Limited.  The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment  The Design Council Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (DC CABE, alternatively Design Council CABE, CABE at the Design Council, or simply CABE), is one of Design Council’s two subsidiaries. It supports communities, local authorities and developers involved in built environment projects by providing services in three areas: design review, customised expert support, and training and continued professional development (CPD). These services are supported by a network of Built Environment Experts (BEEs), a multidisciplinary team of 250 experts from “architecture, planning and infrastructure backgrounds, as well as academics, health specialists, and community engagement workers”. Design Council CABE, which is intended to operate as a self-sustaining business, was formed on 1 April 2011 with about 20 staff from the original CABE after it was merged with the Design Council. The BEE network was formed in 2012.  History  The Design Council began on 19 December 1944 as the Council of Industrial Design (COID), founded by Hugh Dalton, President of the Board of Trade in the wartime Government. Its objective was 'to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry'. S. C. Leslie, the Council's first director, played an important part in the Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946. His 1947 successor Sir Gordon Russell established the organisational model for the next 40 years. Under Sir Paul Reilly the organisation changed its name to the Design Council in 1972. The Design Council was incorporated as a registered charity by Royal Charter in 1976, although it continued to operate as a non-departmental public body. In December 1994 it was restructured, resulting in a functional change from being both an advisory body and a provider of goods and services to a primarily strategic mission “to inspire the best use of design by the United Kingdom in the world context, in order to improve prosperity and wellbeing”. On 1 April 2010 it incorporated a subsidiary trading company called Design Council Enterprises Limited to transact “fundraising activities that are not primary-purpose charitable activity.” On 1 April 2011, it ceased to be a non-departmental public body of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and became an independent registered charity, although it continued to receive grants from the Department. It also officially merged with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) on the same day although Design Council CABE was incorporated four days earlier. In 2017, Design Council appointed Sarah Weir (OBE) as their CEO. =The Design Centre= Sir Gordon Russell, who was heavily involved in the 1951 Festival of Britain, examined ways to reform the education and training of new industrial designers. The Design Centre, in London's Haymarket, was officially opened on 26 April 1956. The Council under Russell combined exhibitions with product endorsements, direct services to industry, commercial publishing and retail. After the Design Council’s restructuring in 1994, the Design Centre was closed to the public. The Design Council continued to operate from the Design Centre until 1998. = The Design journal = Between 1949 and 1999, the Design Council published Design (), a “well-regarded magazine of its own” The journal ceased publication after the summer issue of 1999.  Awards given  British Design Awards logo The Council has hosted the British Design Awards, with the 1987 logo rights co- owned with Manchester Metropolitan University. It was suggested in 1995 in Business Strategy Review magazine that the awards made suitable benchmarks, contributing to industrial competitiveness.

Sally's name—and the name of the eponymous cartoon strip—is a play on words—\\"to sally forth\\" means to set out on an adventure. In 1991 Craig MacIntosh began doing the drawing. In 1999, Howard quit writing as well and turned the task of writing the strip over to Francesco Marciuliano and Steve Alaniz. Jim Keefe took over the artwork in 2013 from Craig MacIntosh, with Marciuliano continuing to write even after Alaniz retired from full-time work on the Sally Forth product line. CharactersSally and her family= *Sally Forth (née Jansen) – The main character, a 40-year-old HR manager with a husband and daughter. She wryly comments on the eccentric behavior of those around her. Following a time skip in the comic on September 3, 2019, Sally is out of a job and currently looking for job opportunities. *Ted Forth – Sally's hopelessly devoted husband, light- hearted with goofball tendencies. Born on Long Island, he is a perpetually 40-year-old white-collar professional working in strategic sourcing, but he was unemployed from May 2007 to May 2008. Ted has four brothers: Timmy, Tommy, Tate and Terry.November 18, 2014 Sally Forth strip He only seems to think \\"outside the box\\", leading him into conflict with family and co-workers. Ted is obsessed with pop culture from his youth, often making references to Star Wars and other science fiction from the era. People find Ted to be a refreshing and realistic portrait of modern fatherhood. For a long while neither his 12-year-old daughter Hilary nor the reader knew Ted's profession. Ted's job, strategic sourcing, was finally mentioned in the strip published on March 8, 2008. He becomes highly competitive while coaching girls' softball. He despises his mother-in-law, who insults his masculinity, and his favorite food is meatloaf. Despite despising his mother-in-law, he cares deeply for her. *Hilary \\"Hil\\" Forth – Sally and Ted's 12-year-old daughter. She is currently in the seventh grade, along with her best friend, Faye. She is very interested in music and sports. From late June 2011 to late August 2011, she developed a relationship with Jon, who was visiting for the summer. Despite having a (rather problematic) long-distance relationship that lasted for four years, she eventually breaks up with Jon in early 2016. Following their breakup, Hil became despondent, but after some time decided to go to summer camp in order to brighten up. After arriving at the camp, however, she immediately felt out of place, even when Bree (an outgoing girl) tried to cheer her up. After a moment of reflection (which included a talk with her 10-years-in-the-future self), Hil decided to become more positive, if not responsible. :Like many comic strips, Sally Forth employs a floating timeline, where time passes but most characters never age. In September 2014, Hilary (in a leaning-on-the-fourth-wall moment) observes to her mother that she was 12 when her cousin Bettina was born, and is still 12, while her cousin is turning one year old. Following a time skip in the comic on September 3, 2019, Hilary is currently 14 (which also puts her in the eighth grade). *Kitty – The Forths' cat, usually only seen in Hilary's room. *Jackie Adams (née Jansen) – Sally's younger sister, prone to juvenile behavior and in general a flippant, impulsive contrast to Sally's responsible personality. She married Sally's former boss, Ralph, in summer 2012; originally, Sally was opposed to her sister marrying her former boss, but eventually came to accept their marriage. She later gave birth to a daughter, Bettina, in September 2013. *Bettina Adams – Jackie and Ralph's daughter, born and introduced in the strips of September 23–29, 2013. Sally has since then become overly proud of her new niece, which is hinted to have sparked a want for another child, something that Ted is dreading. It was revealed at Thanksgiving that Jackie named her daughter after their (Jackie & Sally's) childhood pet cat. After the comic's time skip in September 2019, Bettina has started learning to speak. *Laura – The mother of Sally and Jackie, who is very critical and highly opinionated of Sally, her family, and pretty much everyone else. She shows great joy in tormenting and berating Ted. She is often shown drinking wine. Her infrequent appearances are dreaded by all. Her boyfriend, Gerald, appears senile, rendering him incapable of socializing. =Sally's workplace= *Ralph Adams – Sally's former boss in human resources, Ralph is a caricature of incompetent and self-centered business leadership. Ralph was eventually fired and reduced to working at a fast food restaurant, but in 2006 returned to co-manage the department with Sally. In 2009, he became the sole manager of human resources while Sally became manager of marketing, which was staffed by several lazy, whiny employees who constantly challenged Sally. Sally suffers further anguish from Ralph in 2010 when he starts dating her sister Jackie. In April 2011, it was announced simultaneously that the marketing department would be closed, Ralph would become a consultant so he and Jackie could start a business, and Sally would return to HR as its sole director. Married Sally's sister in 2012; their engagement caused a rift between the sisters for a time as Sally did not approve of the relationship. At age 63, he was about to become a father in 2013.Sally Forth July 18, 2013 strip Their daughter, Bettina (named for Jackie's cat), was born and introduced in the strips of September 23–29, 2013. *Alice Sharples – An employee in HR, and Sally's main confidante at work, Alice is sardonic, self-serving and romantically frustrated. After threatening to leave for 20 years, she finally did so, much to Sally's chagrin, in 2014. Alice made her reappearance on the July 1, 2015 strip for Sally's Fourth of July party, sporting a new hairstyle and new eyeglasses. *Jeff – Sally's blandly competent boss until the comic's time skip in 2019. *Cynthia Keys – A new employee who was introduced in the March 5, 2015 strip. Sally, upon rejecting several oddball job seekers for Alice's position, meets Cynthia and is satisfied with her resume and reasoning for finding a new job. For a time, Sally became rather worried that Cynthia is maybe a little too perfect to replace Alice and, if not hired, could find a job at a different company. In the March 20 strip, Sally has decided to hire her; Cynthia made her first job appearance in the April 8, 2015 strip. Both women get along rather well - they occasionally go out to lunch with each other. The April 10, 2015 strip reveals that she is an aunt to one of the girls (named Jenny) on Ted's softball team and is astounded by his extremely competent behavior, much to Sally's discomfort. Following the comic's time skip in September 2019, Cynthia hasn't been seen since (with the implication that she might have been written out of the comic). =Other characters= *Faye Simmons – Hilary's best friend as of the start of middle school. She comes from a less ideal family than the Forths, cultivates a somewhat rebellious image (which she later changed somewhat over time), and is often blunt to the point of rudeness with adults. She and Hilary started a band (eventually called New Delhi Monkey GangSally Forth August 28, 2014 strip) and later added Nona. At times, she and Hilary are at odds on certain issues – an example at one point in 2014, when Hilary made a pop song \\"You're So Party, Let's Go Dancey\\", Faye disagreed with playing the song and Hilary's ideas of becoming a commercialized mainstream band, leading Hilary to go solo temporarily. Later, both girls apologized and Hilary rejoined the band. Faye's mother, Mrs. Simmons, has also appeared in the strip. *Nona – Hilary and Faye's classmate. She comes from a rich family and has a recording studio, indoor theater, and a guesthouse at her house. She also has a Wii system that can output high definition video, a function unavailable on the actual device. She writes songs and claims she can play every instrument. However, Hilary and Faye are/were a little mixed about Nona due to her slight naive-yet-eccentric demeanor. To their dismay, Nona became estranged from Hilary and Faye in 2012, and, in 2013, had made new friends. She eventually reunited with Hilary and Faye during the summer, after revealing that her new friends only used her. Nona is also recently known to have the ability to read Hilary's, and later Faye's, thoughts. In the summer of 2016, when Hil leaves for summer camp, Faye believes that Nona has developed a crush on Jon (who returned for the summer) since they began to realize they have a little more in common. However, it was revealed that it was Jon who developed a crush; at first Nona says nothing. But after a confrontation, Faye admits Nona probably returns those feelings. This was confirmed since it appeared she got along well with Jon up until the 2017 summer when he revealed that he would no longer visit for the summer; Nona was shocked, but Jon reassured her that they would stay in touch. *Aria – Ted's co-worker, referred to by Alice as his \\"office wife\\" who seems to share Ted's enthusiasm for '70s and '80s pop culture, much to Sally's consternation. Since 2010, Aria hasn't been featured in any strips (indicating that she was probably written out of the comic). *Jon – A boy visiting the area for the summer of 2011, he is from out of town and met Hilary at an Independence Day picnic. After getting to know each other, Jon and Hilary became a couple. He returned for the summer of 2012 and spent more time with Hilary. During the summer of 2013, he returned to visit Hilary again; however, she started to worry that she was not spending time with her friends but she still wanted to spend time with him. Fortunately, Jon still cared for her, thus setting her worries aside. In 2014, he experienced a growth spurt, which Hilary took a while to get used to. In 2015, Hil and Jon began to experience their relationship reaching an impasse, with hints in August and September that they would break up; during the winter, Jon was unable to visit Hil. In the January 16, 2016 strip, it was confirmed that they have broken up (as indicated by a distraught Hil alone in her room). He eventually comes back for the summer, hoping to patch things up with Hil, but was shocked to know that she went to summer camp. While she is gone, he spends time with both Faye and Nona, which makes Faye uncomfortable (mostly due to the fact that Nona might have a crush on Jon). However, it was revealed that it was Jon with the crush, not Nona, and when he attempts to ask her out, Faye interrupts and both girls leave, not wanting to betray Hilary's feelings. In the summer of 2017 (particularly the strips from the August 3rd to the 12th), Jon revealed that he would no longer visit for the summer; while Hil seemed to accept this, Nona was shocked but she decided to accept this as Jon reassured her that they would still keep in touch. *Ted's parents – Ted's mother and father, whose visits or appearances on visits to them, are dreaded by the Forths. Ted's father is a crass and chauvinistic husband who expects Sally to wait on him hand and foot like his own wife and takes anything Ted says as an invitation to argue, while Ted's mother is a depressive, browbeaten homemaker who sees the worst in any given situation. Around 2016, Ted's father developed symptoms of dementia, which had greatly troubled Ted. In October 2017, his health took a turn for the worse (revealing that he was on his deathbed); his death was confirmed on the November 6, 2017 strip. Following his father's death, Ted was inconsolable for a time until he was able to pick up the pieces of his life and move on. *Jenny – A girl who is one of the teammates on Hil's softball team. She is very critical of Ted's coaching and even bluntly mentions criticisms of him, to which he does not take very kindly. It was revealed in 2015 that she is the niece of Cynthia Keys. In the August 21, 2017 strip, Hil introduced Jenny as a new member of her band. *Duncan – A boy introduced in the April 15, 2017 strip, he met up with Hilary when she and her band had performed at their school's dance; although reception from the audience to her band was lukewarm, he praised Hil's performance. In the strips that followed the following week, it appeared that Duncan and Hil were starting to have some feelings for each other. Duncan reappeared in the October 6th and 7th strips when he and Hil were thinking of what to wear for Halloween, with Hil even going as far as suggesting the two of them dress up as a duo. He is also revealed to have a brother. Recurring themes *Sally has a quirky habit of eating the ears off of her daughter's chocolate Easter bunnies. Hilary annually schemes to hide her bunny but usually fails. As a result, Hilary is frustrated while Sally reacts indifferently and with no remorse. *The Forth family has long dreamed of taking a vacation in Paris and has been on the verge of departing several times, only to have some unexpected tragedies or complications stop them. The family even mention this unfortunate dilemma at times when they face a similar outcome. *Hillary with her two best friends, Faye and Nona, has a band that produced the original and bad remixes of \\"You're So Party, Let's Go Dancey\\" much to the dissatisfaction of Faye and Hil's parents, though Ted wholeheartedly supports her endeavors. *Several strips in 2006 and 2007 alluded to the fact that no one really knew what Ted's job was, a metatextual reference to the often vague nature of comic characters' employment. After his layoff, Hilary frets that they will never know the truth. On March 8, 2008, Ted mentions for the first time that his job was/is strategic sourcing—a procurement initiative run by several Fortune 500 companies. *Almost every autumn (or rarely some other season), the Forths usually venture into a corn maze and get hopelessly lost. *Ted coached Hilary's all-girls softball team, which is so bad that it rarely, if ever, wins a game. The team performed so poorly that Ted once made a wild promise that they would go on a trip to Walt Disney World if it won the league championship; however, he expected not to have to follow through with the promise. Though personally enthusiastic, Ted seemed to have fatalistically accepted the team's losing streak and took to giving pre-game pep talks made up of equal parts exasperation and stream-of- consciousness rambling; one talk featured a quote from The Godfather. Because of this, Ted was discouraged from coaching the team during the 2008 version of the storyline. In 2011, however, the team did win the championship for their league which Ted overreacted in joy that he finally accomplished something. Afterward, up until 2016, the team was back in the cellar of the league, much to Ted's dismay. In the summer of 2016, the softball team won their second championship, although Hil was not with the team since she was away at a summer camp; nevertheless, Ted (while excited at having won the championship again) was grateful to see Hil return. :Another part of this recurring theme is that the girls on the team mention their parents' negative opinions of Ted's coaching, which Ted reacts rather harshly towards while Hilary either tries to intervene or just does not bother. *Ted sometimes appears aware that he is in a comic strip, making vague references to the floating timeline they are in, and occasionally seeming to break the fourth wall and address the reader directly, to the complete confusion of all the other characters. In 2015, other characters have pondered about their existence in a strip and its plot. Books *Sally Forth by Fawcett Columbine, 1987. *I Gave at the Office by Andrews McMeel, 1994.

Since 1 January 2019, it is part of the municipality Geratal. It was the administrative seat of the former Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Oberes Geratal. Geography Wilde Gera bridge of the BAB 71 The municipal area stretches along the valley of the Wilde Gera river and its Lütsche tributary, northeast of the Thuringian Forest mountain range and the Rennsteig ridge. The Lütsche Reservoir built in 1935-38 is located west of the settlement. The municipality has access to the Bundesautobahn 71 near the Rennsteig Tunnel at Gräfenroda junction, about to the southeast. With a population of about 3200, Gräfenroda is the district's fourth-largest municipality, though without town privileges. History Gräfenroda was first mentioned in a 1290 deed, located on an important trade route from Arnstadt to Suhl. From the early 14th century onwards, the local estates were held by the Thuringian noble house of Schwarzburg. From 1640 half of the estates were in possession of the Ernestine dukes of Saxe-Gotha, while the remaining Schwarzenburg parts from 1716 were ruled within the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. The local population was largely involved in agriculture and forestry, but also in copper, silver and lead mining, as well as in glass production. Gartenzwerg museum While in the mid 19th century, numerous people emigrated from the remote area to the United States, the local economy developed in the course of the industrialisation. Gräfenroda station on the Neudietendorf–Ritschenhausen railway line was inaugurated by the Thuringian Railway Company in 1884, followed by a railway line to Gotha in 1892. In the 1870s, two local companies began the industrial production of garden gnomes (). After their first appearance at the 1898 Leipzig Trade Fair, these figurines became increasingly popular throughout Germany, with Gräfenroda as a centre of manufacturing. Today, a museum examines the history of garden gnomes. From 1858 Gräfenroda was incorporated into the Ohrdruf district within the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It became part of the Free State of Thuringia in 1920.

He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Clark. Slim completed two years of high school, at which time he became a professional musician at the age of 15 in 1932 - however, he was performing at grange halls and fairs as early as 1930. In 1945, Slim began spending his summers in Maine, and in 1952 he became a resident there. Clark was first married to Mildred Towne from North Dana. They had two children, Lee and May. He was married to Celia Jo Roberson Clark in 1943. He had two children with Celia, Jewel LaVerne Clark and Wilf Carter Clark, both of whom have pursued careers in music, including yodeling. He was divorced from Celia in 1968. He was married in 1981 to Dr. Kathleen M. Pigeon Clark. Raymond Clark died in St. Albans, Maine on July 5, 2000. Kathleen Clark still resides there. Music career His early days included performances at WHAI in Greenfield, Massachusetts and WKNE in Keene, New Hampshire. In 1936, he went on the air as \\"Wyoming Buck\\" and a few months later the radio station manager renamed him \\"Yodeling Slim Clark\\" - which was his trademark throughout his career. His performances at WKNE starting in 1938 included a memorable weekly show with legendary Keene announcer Ozzie Wade. Later, he moved to Maine, where he starred in the 1960s on the Bangor radio program, \\"RFD Dinnerbell\\". From 1952-1967 he was featured in both radio and television programs at WABI in Bangor. Though primarily known as a single act, Slim's bands included the \\"Red River Rangers\\", \\"The Trailriders\\" and \\"The Trailsmen\\". Country music favorites Kenny Roberts and Dick Curless (The Tumbleweed Kid) were members of the Red River Rangers and the Trailriders, respectively. In 1946, Slim signed with Continental Records in New York City, at the urging of yodeler Elton Britt. He made his first 78 rpm recording that same year. The songs he recorded at Continental were largely traditional cowboy and folk tunes, along with a few Wilf Carter songs and some originals, often co-written with Pete Roy. Clark stayed with the label until 1957, followed by associations with several independent labels. He cut four singles for Doc Williams' Wheeling label in 1953 and later made an album for the Canadian Arc label. In 1965, Clark recorded a few excellent albums for Palomino records. During his very active career, Slim recorded over 50 78s, 40 45s and over 25 albums. Copies of his old 78s are in the Library at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, and have become collector's items. Slim also appeared coast-to-coast on both the NBC network and the ABC network on different jamborees. He was featured on Folk Music USA. Slim performed western music for 70 years. He gained popularity throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe with only a handful of appearances outside his lifelong New England base. After a partial retirement in the early 1970s, he recorded for Palomino Records, and played many festivals during the summertime. Slim won the World Yodeling Championship in 1947 and was inducted into the Yodeler's Hall of Fame, along with Jimmie Rodgers, Elton Britt, and Wilf Carter. He was a member of the Western Music Association's Hall of Fame. He is represented in the Walkway of Stars at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. In November 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Maine Country Music Hall of Fame, Massachusetts Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rhode Island Country Music Hall of Fame. The Old Chisholm Trail =Influences= Two of the biggest influences on Slim's music and career were Jimmie Rodgers and Wilf Carter (Montana Slim). Around 1930, after hearing a Montana Slim national radio broadcast, he decided to become a cowboy singer. \\"A cowboy,\\" he said, \\"is anyone who lives that type of life, no matter where he is.\\" Retirement and non-music careers During his younger days, Slim played pro-baseball as a pitcher for the Blackstone Valley League in Massachusetts. He later tried out to be a pitcher of the Boston Braves. He was an avid sports fan, following baseball, football, basketball and golf. In addition to sports, he maintained a lifelong interest in hunting and fishing, as well as farming and was a Registered Guide in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont for over 17 years. In retirement, most of his time was spent painting. He became recognized for his lifelike paintings of outdoors scenes—one of his most popular paintings being that of a Lombard Log hauler.

It is one of his best-known and most frequently performed plays. In the setting of a rundown seaside boarding house, a little birthday party is turned into a nightmare when two sinister strangers arrive unexpectedly. The play has been classified as a comedy of menace, characterised by Pinteresque elements such as ambiguous identity, confusions of time and place, and dark political symbolism. Pinter began writing The Birthday Party in the summer of 1957 while touring in Doctor in the House. He later said: \\"I remember writing the big interrogation scene in a dressing room in Leicester.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/03/theatre.stage Characters * Petey, a man in his sixties * Meg, a woman in her sixties * Stanley, a man in his late thirties * Lulu, a girl in her early twenties * Goldberg, a man in his fifties * McCann, a man of thirty (The Birthday Party, Grove Press ed., 8) Summary The Birthday Party is about Stanley Webber, an erstwhile piano player who lives in a rundown boarding house run by Meg and Petey Boles, in an English seaside town, \\"probably on the south coast, not too far from London\\".Harold Pinter, Faber Critical Guides (London: Faber and Faber, 2000) 57: The setting evokes \\"Basingstoke and Maidenhead, southern towns ... and ... London – in both Goldberg and Stanley's reminiscences.\\"Audio interview with Harold Pinter, conducted by Rebecca Jones, BBC Radio 4, bbc.co.uk/today, 12 May 2008, Web, 14 May 2008. Two sinister strangers, Goldberg and McCann, arrive looking for him, supposedly on his birthday, and turn his apparently innocuous birthday party organised by Meg into a nightmare. The Birthday Party synopsis, in Samuel French Basic Catalog, rpt. in samuelfrench.com (\\"Little Theatre\\"), n.d., Web, 10 May 2008. Plot ;Act 1 While Meg prepares to serve her husband Petey breakfast, Stanley, described as a man \\"in his late thirties\\" (23), who is dishevelled and unshaven, enters from upstairs. Alternating between maternal and flirtatious affectation toward Stanley, Meg tells him that \\"two gentlemen\\", two new \\"visitors\\", will be arriving (30–31); Stanley appears concerned and suspicious at this information. At \\"[a] sudden knock on the front door\\", Meg goes offstage while Stanley \\"listens\\" at a voice coming \\"through the letter box,\\" but it is just Lulu carrying in a package delivered for Meg. Right after Meg and Lulu exit, Goldberg and McCann arrive, but Stanley immediately \\"sidles through the kitchen door and out of the back door\\" to eavesdrop (38), but they speak only vaguely about \\"this job\\" they must do with bureaucratic clichés (41), nevertheless rendering McCann \\"satisfied\\" (41). After Meg's new \\"guests\\" go up to their room, Stanley enters and Meg gives him the package brought by Lulu containing his birthday present. He opens it to reveal a toy drum. ;Act 2 Stanley encounters McCann and the two talk. McCann is determined to stop Stanley from leaving the house. Stanley's behaviour and speech start to become erratic. He denies the fact that it is his birthday, insists that Meg is mad for saying so, and asks McCann if Goldberg told him why he has been brought to the house. Goldberg enters and sends McCann out to collect some whiskey that he has ordered for the party. When McCann returns, he and Goldberg interrogate Stanley with a series of ambiguous, rhetorical questions, tormenting him to complete collapse. Meg then enters in her party dress, and the party proceeds with a series of toasts in Stanley's honor. Lulu then arrives and engages with Goldberg in romance. The party culminates with a game of blind man's buff, during which McCann further taunts Stanley by breaking his glasses and trapping his foot in the toy drum. Stanley then attacks Meg and, in the blackout that immediately follows, attacks and attempts to rape Lulu. The act ends with Goldberg and McCann backing the maniacally laughing Stanley against a wall. ;Act 3 Paralleling the first scene of the play, Petey is having breakfast, and Meg asks him innocuous questions, with important differences revealing the aftermath of the party. After Meg leaves to do some shopping, Petey begins to express concern to Goldberg about Stanley's condition and Goldberg's intention to take him to an unseen character called Monty. There then follows an exchange between Goldberg and McCann during which Goldberg's usual confident style temporarily abandons him, though he seems to recover after asking McCann to blow in his mouth. Lulu then confronts Goldberg about the way he was the previous night (during unseen events that occurred after the party) but is driven from the house by McCann making unsavoury comments about her character and demanding that she confess her sins to him. McCann then brings in Stanley, with his broken glasses, and he and Goldberg bombard him with a list of his faults and of all the benefits he will obtain by submitting to their influence. When asked for his opinion of what he has to gain, Stanley is unable to answer. They begin to lead him out of the house toward the car waiting to take him to Monty. Petey confronts them one last time but passively backs down as they take Stanley away, \\"broken\\", calling out \\"Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!\\" (101). After Meg returns from shopping, she notices that \\"The car's gone\\" and as Petey remains silent, he continues to withhold his knowledge of Stanley's departure, allowing her to end the play without knowing the truth about Stanley. Genre  The Birthday Party has been described (some say \\"pigeonholed\\") by Irving Wardle and later critics as a \\"comedy of menace\\"As cited by Susan Hollis Merritt, Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (1990; Durham and London: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9, 225–28, 326. and by Martin Esslin as an example of the Theatre of the Absurd.Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd, 3rd ed., with a new foreword by the author (1961; New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004).

Interpretation Like many of Pinter's other plays, very little of the expository information in The Birthday Party is verifiable; it is contradicted by the characters and otherwise ambiguous, and, therefore, one cannot take what they say at face value. For example, in Act One, Stanley describes his career, saying \\"I've played the piano all over the world,\\" reduces that immediately to \\"All over the country,\\" and then, after a pause, undercuts both statements by saying \\"I once gave a concert.\\"Harold Pinter, The Birthday Party, in The Essential Pinter (New York: Grove P, 2006) 14. (Subsequent parenthetical page references to this edition appear in the text.) While the title and the dialogue refer to Meg's planning a party to celebrate Stanley's birthday: \\"It's your birthday, Stan. I was going to keep it a secret until tonight,\\" even that fact is dubious, as Stanley denies that it is his birthday: \\"This isn't my birthday, Meg\\" (48), telling Goldberg and McCann: \\"Anyway, this isn't my birthday. [...] No, it's not until next month,\\" adding, in response to McCann's saying \\"Not according to the lady [Meg],\\" \\"Her? She's crazy. Round the bend\\" (53). Although Meg claims that her house is a boarding house, her husband Petey, who was confronted by two men who \\"wanted to know if we could put them up for a couple of nights\\" is surprised that Meg already has prepared a room (23) and Stanley (being the only supposed boarder) also responds to what appears to him to be the sudden appearance of Goldberg and McCann as prospective guests on a supposed short holiday, flat out denies that it is a boarding house: \\"This is a ridiculous house to pick on. [...] Because it's not a boarding house. It never was.\\" (53) McCann claims to have no knowledge of Stanley or Maidenhead when Stanley asks him \\"Ever been anywhere near Maidenhead? [...] There's a Fuller's teashop. I used to have my tea there. [...] and a Boots Library. I seem to connect you with the High Street. [...] A charming town, don't you think? [...] A quiet, thriving community. I was born and brought up there. I lived well away from the main road\\" (51); yet Goldberg later names both businesses that Stanley used to frequent connecting Goldberg and possibly also McCann to Maidenhead: \\"A little Austin, tea in Fuller's a library book from Boots, and I'm satisfied\\" (70). Of course, both Stanley and Goldberg could just be inventing these apparent reminiscences as they both appear to have invented other details about their lives earlier, and here Goldberg could conveniently be lifting details from Stanley's earlier own mention of them, which he has heard; as Merritt observes, the factual basis for such apparent correspondences in the dialogue uttered by Pinter's characters remains ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.John Russell Brown, \\"Words and Silence\\" (1972), rpt. in 87–99 of Casebook, ed. Scott. (Subsequent parenthetical page references to Brown appear in the text.) Shifting identities (cf. \\"the theme of identity\\") makes the past ambiguous: Goldberg is called \\"Nat,\\" but in his stories of the past he says that he was called \\"Simey\\" (73) and also \\"Benny\\" (92), and he refers to McCann as both \\"Dermot\\" (in talking to Petey [87]) and \\"Seamus\\" (in talking to McCann [93]). Given such contradictions, these characters' actual names and thus identities remain unclear. According to John Russell Brown (94), \\"Falsehoods are important for Pinter's dialogue, not least when they can be detected only by careful reference from one scene to another.... Some of the more blatant lies are so casually delivered that the audience is encouraged to look for more than is going to be disclosed. This is a part of Pinter's two-pronged tactic of awakening the audience's desire for verification and repeatedly disappointing this desire\\" (Brown 94). Although Stanley, just before the lights go out during the birthday party, begins to strangle Meg (78), she has no memory of that the next morning, quite possibly because she had drunk too much (71–74); oblivious to the fact that Goldberg and McCann have removed Stanley from the house – Petey keeps that information from her when she inquires, \\"Is he still in bed?\\" by answering \\"Yes, he's ... still asleep\\"––she ends the play focusing on herself and romanticising her role in the party, \\"I was the belle of the ball. [...] I know I was” (102). For some, Petey’s final reply only makes dramatic sense if the framework of the whole play is in Meg’s mind, that her invention of Stan was necessary in an empty marriage, and what the audience has seen was a tragic possibility - no doubt to be followed by another narrative when her Stan arrives. =Meg and Petey Boles= While on tour with L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter found himself in Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a stranger in a pub who said \\"I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly,\\" and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, > I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the > landlady and a little man, the landlord. There was no one else there, apart > from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in > the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there > was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from > which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, \\"What are you > doing here?\\" And he said, \\"Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to > play in the concert-party here and I gave that up.\\" ... The woman was really > quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and > goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he > stayed, he said, \\"There's nowhere else to go.\\"Michael Billington, Harold > Pinter, rev. and expanded ed. of The Life and Work of Harold Pinter (1996; > London: Faber and Faber, 2007) 76. (Subsequent parenthetical references to > this edition appear in the text.) According to Billington, \\"The lonely lodger, the ravenous landlady, the quiescent husband: these figures, eventually to become Stanley, Meg, and Petey, sound like figures in a Donald McGill seaside postcard\\" (Harold Pinter 76). =Goldberg and McCann= Goldberg and McCann \\"represent not only the West's most autocratic religions, but its two most persecuted races\\" (Billington, Harold Pinter 80). James goes by many names, sometimes Nat, but when talking about his past he mentions that he was called by the names \\"Simey\\" and also \\"Benny\\". He seems to idolise his Uncle Barney as he mentions him many times during the play. Goldberg is portrayed as a Jewish man which is reinforced by his typically Jewish name and his appropriate use of Yiddish words. McCann is an unfrocked priest and has two names. Petey refers to him as Dermot but Goldberg calls him Seamus. The sarcasm in the following exchange evokes some distance in their relationship: :McCANN: You've always been a true Christian :GOLDBERG: In a way. =Stanley Webber= Stanley Webber — \\"a palpably Jewish name, incidentally — is a man who shores up his precarious sense of self through fantasy, bluff, violence and his own manipulative form of power-play. His treatment of Meg initially is rough, playful, teasing, ... but once she makes the fateful, mood-changing revelation —'I've got to get things ready for the two gentlemen'—he's as dangerous as a cornered animal\\" (Billington, Harold Pinter 78). =Lulu= Lulu is a woman in her twenties whom Stanley \\"tries vainly to rape\\" (Billington, Harold Pinter 112) during the titular birthday party at the end of Act II. Themes According to Pinter's official biographer, Michael Billington, in Harold Pinter, echoing Pinter's own retrospective view of it, The Birthday Party is \\"a deeply political play about the individual's imperative need for resistance,\\" yet, according to Billington, though he \\"doubts whether this was conscious on Pinter's part,\\" it is also \\"a private, obsessive work about time past; about some vanished world, either real or idealised, into which all but one of the characters readily escapes. ... From the very outset, the defining quality of a Pinter play is not so much fear and menace –– though they are undoubtedly present –– as a yearning for some lost Eden as a refuge from the uncertain, miasmic present\\" (82). As quoted by Arnold P. Hinchliffe, Polish critic Grzegorz Sinko points out that in The Birthday Party \\"we see the destruction of the victim from the victim's own point of view: > \\"One feels like saying that the two executioners, Goldberg and McCann, stand > for all the principles of the state and social conformism. Goldberg refers > to his 'job' in a typically Kafka-esque official language which deprives the > crimes of all sense and reality.\\" ... [Of Stanley's removal, Sinko adds:] > \\"Maybe Stanley will meet his death there or maybe he will only receive a > conformist brainwashing after which he is promised ... many other gifts of > civilization....\\"Arnold P. Hinchliffe, Harold Pinter, Twayne's English > Authors Ser.; The Griffin Authors Ser. (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1967; > New York: St. Martin's P, 1967) 55, 186. Hinchliffe is quoting from Gregorz > Sinko, \\"Star i Młoda Anglia\\", Dialogue, 60.4 (April 1961): 97–99. (In > Polish.) In an interview with Mel Gussow, which is about the 1988 Classic Stage Company production of The Birthday Party, later paired with Mountain Language in a 1989 CSC production, in both of which David Strathairn played Stanley, Gussow asked Pinter: \\"The Birthday Party has the same story as One for the Road?\\" In the original interview first published in The New York Times on 30 December 1988, Gussow quotes Pinter as stating: \\"The character of the old man, Petey, says one of the most important lines I've ever written. As Stanley is taken away, Petey says, 'Stan, don't let them tell you what to do.' I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now.\\"This interview was first published in Mel Gussow, \\"Pinter's Plays Following Him out of Enigma and into Politics\\", The New York Times, 30 December 1988: C17, as cited in Susan Hollis Merritt, \\"Pinter and Politics,\\" in chap. 8, \\"Cultural Politics\\" of Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (Durham and London: Duke UP, 1995) 179. [Petey's line is one of two epigraphs for Pinter in Play; the other is Goldberg's line relating to the theme of social conformity discussed in criticism of the play by Sinko [as cited by Hinchliffe] and others: \\"Play up, play up, and play the game\\" (Cf. The Birthday Party in The Essential Pinter 92).] Pinter's comment on Petey's line from Gussow's 30 December 1988 New York Times interview with Pinter is also cited by Gussow in his \\"Introduction\\" to Conversations with Pinter, which refers to the edited version of the interview as reprinted in the \\"December 1988\\" section of the collection entitled \\"'Stan, don't let them tell you what to do'\\" (65–79): \\"In conversation in 1988, Harold Pinter said that he lived that line all his life. That stubborn individuality has been a chief motivating factor for the playwright, whether he was rejecting his call up for national service as a young man, or, later in his life, reacting to censors, dismissive critics or nations undermining human rights. In the broadest sense, Pinter has always been a conscientious objector, even as people keep trying to tell him what to do\\" (9). In responding to Gussow's question, Pinter refers to all three plays when he replies: \\"It's the destruction of an individual, the independent voice of an individual. I believe that is precisely what the United States is doing to Nicaragua. It's a horrifying act. If you see child abuse, you recognize it and you're horrified. If you do it yourself, you apparently don't know what you're doing.\\"Qtd. in Mel Gussow, Conversations with Harold Pinter (London: Nick Hern Books, 1994) 69. As Bob Bows observes in his review of the 2008 Germinal Stage Denver production, whereas at first \\" 'The Birthday Party' appears to be a straightforward story of a former working pianist now holed up in a decrepit boarding house,\\" in this play as in his other plays, \\"behind the surface symbolism ... in the silence between the characters and their words, Pinter opens the door to another world, cogent and familiar: the part we hide from ourselves\\"; ultimately, \\"Whether we take Goldberg and McCann to be the devil and his agent or simply their earthly emissaries, the puppeteers of the church-state apparatus, or some variation thereof, Pinter's metaphor of a bizarre party bookended by birth and death is a compelling take on this blink- of-an-eye we call life.\\"Bob Bows, 'The Birthday Party' : *** (out of four stars)\\", The Denver Post, denverpost.com, 11 April 2008, Web, 10 May 2008.

He was included in Time magazine's list of World's 100 Most Influential People in 2010. Bhagat graduated in mechanical engineering at IIT Delhi and completed an MBA at IIM Ahmedabad. He started his career as an investment banker, but left it after a few years to pursue his passion in writing. He has written eight novels and three non-fiction books. His first novel, Five Point Someone, was published in 2004. His novels have been listed as bestsellers. Five of Chetan Bhagat's novels have been adapted into Bollywood films like Hello in 2008 (based on One Night @ the Call Center), 3 Idiots in 2009 (based on Five Point Someone), Kai Po Che! in 2013 (based on The 3 Mistakes of My Life); 2 States in 2014 (based on his novel of the same name) and Half Girlfriend in 2017 (based on his novel of the same name). Bhagat has also written the scripts for Bollywood films like Kick in 2014 and adapted his stories for the movies Kai Po Che! and Half Girlfriend. Bhagat won the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay for Kai Po Che! at the 59th Filmfare Awards in 2014. Bhagat is often invited to speak at various institutes and organisations in India and abroad. He is also active on social media. He also writes op-ed columns for English and Hindi newspapers, including The Guardian, The Times of India and Dainik Bhaskar, focusing on youth, career, leadership, political issues and current affairs. Early life Chetan Bhagat grew up in Naraina Vihar, West Delhi in a traditional middle class Hindu family. His father served as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army and mother worked in a government job in the agriculture department. He was schooled at The Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan. He claims to have been an average student at the age of 15. In Class V, Bhagat submitted a small joke for his school magazine, after being forced to do so by his teacher. Seeing his name in print greatly impressed him. Bhagat graduated with a BTech degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1995. He stayed in IIT Delhi's Kumaon Hostel in Room No NB 24, which is now considered lucky by hostellers as it is believed that two other published authors, besides Bhagat had stayed in the same room. Bhagat then went on to do MBA in Marketing from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) and graduated in 1997 with an MBA degree. He was awarded as the \\"Best Outgoing Student\\" of his batch. In June 2018, IIMA awarded him the \\"Young Alumni Achiever’s Awards 2018\\" in the Art & Entertainment category.  Career  After graduating with an MBA in 1997, Bhagat was placed through his campus at Peregrine Investments Holdings in Hong Kong. However, Bhagat lost this job within six months as the company closed its operations in 1998. His next banking job was as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs at their Hong Kong office. Despite being unhappy with his boss at the bank, he stayed on due to lack of options. Bhagat kept this boss in his mind when he characterised the villain in his second novel One Night @ the Call Center. Bhagat spent most of his time at the Goldman Sachs office in writing, completing and revising drafts of his first novel, Five Point Someone. He worked on 15 drafts of the manuscript. He kept contacting publishers and was rejected. After two years, Rupa Publications accepted his manuscript and offered to publish it after some feedback. After the required changes were made, the novel Five Point Someone was finally published in 2004, when it was declared to be a best-seller. Bhagat then quit Goldman Sachs and joined Deutsche Bank. By 2006, he was vice-president, Strategic Investment Group, Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong. His second novel, One Night @ the Call Center, was published in 2005 and became a best-seller. The entire print-run of 50,000 copies of the book was sold within three days, setting a record for India's fastest-selling book. In March 2008, Bhagat shifted back to India with his wife and three-year-old twin sons after spending more than 10 years in Hong Kong. He joined as director in Deutsche Bank's distressed-assets team in Kodak House, Mumbai. The same year his third novel, The 3 Mistakes of My Life, was published and sold five lakh copies in three months. Bhagat continued to work as an investment banker in 2008 in Deutsche Bank, Mumbai, putting in 12 hours in the office. His day job would keep him busy analysing the financial reports of loss-making companies and bad loan portfolios of other banks that Deutsche Bank may eventually acquire. He kept a low profile in the bank despite having three best-sellers to his credit. Neither the head of corporate communications in the bank, nor the HR head were aware that Bhagat worked with them in their Mumbai office. By August 2008, Bhagat was earning as much from his writing, as he was from his bank job. He had three successful best-seller novels and two movies based on his novels were being shot. It was in 2009 that Bhagat quit his international investment banking career to devote full-time to writing. Bhagat considers writing to be a flexible career which \\"you can do... anywhere\\" He accepts the fact that his personal life suffers at times because of his professional commitments. The protagonist of all his novels is named after Krishna. =Screenwriting= Bhagat has also taken steps in Bollywood by writing dialogues and screenplays for Bollywood films based on his novels and also for a film not based on his novel. Five of his novels have been adapted into movies. For the 2008 film Hello, based on his novel One Night @ the Call Center, Bhagat received two film credits — 'Additional dialogue' and 'Book'. Regarding the film 3 Idiots released in 2009 (based on his novel Five Point Someone), Bhagat alleged that the makers of the film had \\"played\\" with him and had not given him adequate credit. His name came in the end credits or rolling credits of the film. He claimed that 70% of the film was based on his book, while he had been initially informed that only 2-5% of the film followed the book's story. Bhagat later ended the debate by claiming to have moved on. For the film Kai Po Che!' (2013) based on his novel The 3 Mistakes of My Life, Bhagat was one of the four screenplay writers for the film and was closely involved in the adaptation of the book for the film. Bhagat's then eight-year- old son Ishaan made his acting debut in the film. It took Bhagat two years to write the screenplay. The film was a commercial success and Bhagat along with Pubali Chaudri, Supratik Sen and Abhishek Kapoor won the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay for Kai Po Che! at the 59th Filmfare Awards. Bhagat says that his \\"greatest inspiration is Gulzar, an author who has done films scripts as well.\\"  Reception  Bhagat was referred to as \\"the biggest-selling English- language novelist ever in India\\" according to The New York Times. However, he has been criticised for his writing skills. He has even been accused of plagiarism for his novel One Indian Girl, which he denied. In April 2017, the University of Delhi's decision to include Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone as part of the English Literature syllabus was criticised. In September 2017 the University announced that they had kept this decision on hold.

African nationalism is an umbrella term which refers to a group of political ideologies, mainly within Sub-Saharan Africa, which are based on the idea of national self-determination and the creation of nation states.African nationalism The ideology emerged under European colonial rule during the 19th and 20th centuries and was loosely inspired by nationalist ideas from Europe. Originally, African nationalism was based on demands for self-determination and played an important role in forcing the process of decolonisation of Africa ( 1957–66). However, the term refers to a broad range of different ideological and political movements and should not be confused with Pan-Africanism which may seek the federation of several or all nation states in Africa. History Nationalist ideas in Sub-Saharan Africa emerged during the mid-19th century among the emerging black middle classes in West Africa. Early nationalists hoped to overcome ethnic fragmentation by creating nation-states. In its earliest period, it was inspired by African-American and Afro-Caribbean intellectuals from the Back-to-Africa movement who imported nationalist ideals current in Europe and the Americas at the time. The early African nationalists were elitist and believed in the supremacy of Western culture but sought a greater role for themselves in political decision-making. They rejected African traditional religions and tribalism as \\"primitive\\" and embraced western ideas of Christianity, modernity, and the nation state. However, one of the challenges faced by nationalists in unifying their nation after European rule were the divisions of tribes and the formation of ethnicism. Ghanaian nationalists celebrating the 50th anniversary of national independence in 2007 African nationalism first emerged as a mass movement in the years after World War II as a result of wartime changes in the nature of colonial rule as well as social change in Africa itself. Nationalist political parties were established in almost all African colonies during the 1950s and their rise was an important reason for the decolonisation of Africa between 1957 and 1966. However, African nationalism was never a single movement and political groups considered to be African nationalists varied by economic orientation and degrees of radicalism and violence. Nationalists leaders struggled to find their own social and national identity following the European influence that controlled the political landscape during the colonial occupation. African nationalism in the colonial era was often framed purely in opposition to colonial rule and was therefore frequently unclear or contradictory about its other objectives. According to historian Robert I. Rotberg, African nationalism would not have emerged without colonialism. Its relation to Pan-Africanism was also ambiguous with many nationalist leaders professing Pan-African loyalties but still refusing to commit to supranational unions. African nationalists of the period have also been criticised for their continued use of ideas and policies associated with colonial states. In particular, nationalists usually attempted to preserve national frontiers created arbitrarily under colonial rule after independence and create a national sense of national identity among the heterogeneous populations inside them.  Tribalism and ethnic nationalism  African nationalism exists in an uneasy relationship with tribalism and sub-national ethnic nationalism which differ in their conceptions of political allegiance. Many Africans distinguish between their ethnic and national identities. Some nationalists have argued that tribes were a colonial creation.  Women in African nationalism  During the late 1950s and 1960s, scholars of African nationalist struggles have primarily focused on the Western-educated male elites who led the nationalist movements and assumed power after independence. The history of studies of women's involvement in African nationalist struggle, mobilization, and party politics can be traced along intellectual and political paths that initially followed, later paralleled, but have seldom deviated from or led the course of Africanist historiography. The goal of these women involved in the African nationalism movement was to recover Africa's past and to celebrate the independent emergence of independent Africa. It was necessary to raise awareness of this cause, calling to the new emerging generation of African women, raised in a better, more stable society. Although, the challenges they faced seemed increasingly more significant, they however had it better than past generations, allowing them to raise awareness of the African Nationalist moment. Whereas women's historians interested in effecting changes in the process and production of American or European history had to fight their way onto trains that had been moving through centuries on well-worn gauges, the \\"new\\" Africanist train had barely left the station in the early '60s. With a few exceptions, scholars have devoted little more than a passing mention of the presence of African women as conscious political actors in African nationalism. Anne McClintock has stressed that \\"all nationalisms are gendered.\\"A. McClintock, ‘“No Longer in Future Heaven”: Gender, Race and Nationalism,’ in Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation and Postcolonial Perspectives ed. A. McClintock, A. Mufti, E. Shohat (United States, 1997). Undoubtedly, women played a significant role in arousing national consciousness as well as elevating their own political and social position through African nationalism.S. Geiger, J.M Allman and N. Musisi, Women in African Colonial Histories (Bloomington, 2002). It is with this in mind, that both feminism and the research of these women become critical to the re- evaluation of the history of African nationalism. In 1943, a prominent organization called the African National Congress Women's League used its branches throughout the country to build a national campaign. =Women in national organisations= As leaders and activists, women participated in African nationalism through national organisations. The decade of the 1950s was a landmark because of the significant number of women who were politically involved in the nationalist struggle. A minority of women were incorporated and affiliated into male-dominated national organisations. Founded by women in 1960, The National Council of Sierra Leone was to become, in 1968, the women's section of the ruling All People's Congress and dedicated primarily to the vigorous support of head of state, President Stevens. Women activists extended and conveyed militant behaviours. Nancy Dolly Steele was the organizing secretary and co-founder of the Congress, and has been noted for her militant political and nationalist activities. In the same way, throughout Africa, the influence of trade union movements, in particular, became the spawning ground for women organisers as such. South African women, for instance, emerged as primary catalysts for protests against the Apartheid regime. These women first participated in resistance movements through women's branches of the larger male dominated liberation organizations, as through the African National Congress (ANC). Nevertheless, in 1943, the ANC adopted a new constitution which included a new position for women to become full members of the national movement. Women also formed their own national organisations, such as the Federation of South African Women in 1954, which boasted a membership of 230,000 women. Though at the time women viewed themselves primarily as mothers and wives, the act of their joining in political organisations illustrated a kind of feminist consciousness.L. L. Frates, ‘Women in the South African National Liberation Movement, 1948 – 1960: An Historiographical Overview,’ Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies Vol. 21, No. 1-2 (1993). =Women as national leaders= Women were fundamental nationalist leaders in their own right. Under the inspiration of Bibi Titi Mohammed, a former singer in Dar es Salaam who became a Tanganyikan nationalist, Tanzanian women were organised into a Women's Section of the Tanganyikan African National Union. Mohammed, who was semi-illiterate, was an impressive orator and later combined her nationalist work in the 1950s with her political ambitions. She was one of the most visible Tanganyikan nationalists during the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.S. Geiger, “Women in Nationalist Struggle: Tanu Activists in Dar es Salaam,” The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 20, No. 1, (1987), 1 – 26. She was the only nationalist leader, besides Julius Nyerere, who was recognized across the country at the time of Tanzanian independence. Her legacy as a leader, speaker, organiser and activist is testimony to the pivotal role played by many uneducated women in spreading a national consciousness, a political awareness and securing independence from British rule in Tanzania. =Women and Informal Methods of Protest= Whilst some female-oriented initiatives may have been conceived and presented to women by male party-leaders, others were clearly created by women themselves. These women used nationalism as a platform to address their own concerns as wives, mothers, industrial workers, peasants, and as women affiliated to the ANC. The 1940s Anti-tax protest in Tanzania involved the women of Peasant Pare, where women employed methods of direct confrontation, provocative language and physical violence. Explicit use of sexual insult was also central to the powerful Anlu protest of the Cameroon in 1958, where women refused to implement agricultural regulations that would have undermined their farming system.Jean O'Barr, ‘African Women in Politics,’ in African Women South of the Sahara, ed. M. J. Hay and S. Stichter (London, 1984). In the same way, women used music, dance and informal methods to convey their solidarity for African nationalism. The production of Tanganyikan nationalism in Tanzania can be seen as “woman’s work,” where women evoked, created and performed nationalism through their dances and songs.S. Geiger, ‘Women and African Nationalism,’ Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 – 244. Equally, women were considered the best sloganeers, as traditional story-tellers and singers using ideas, images and phrases that appealed to the non-elite population. Market women in coastal Nigeria and Guinea also used their networks to convey anti-government information.E. Schmidt, ‘Top Down or Bottom Up? Nationalist Mobilization Reconsidered, with Special Reference to Guinea (French West Africa,’ American Historical Review (October, 2005), 975 – 1014. ‘Ordinary’ women themselves had transformed \\"traditional\\" methods for networking and expressing disapproval against individuals, into mechanisms for challenging and unsettling the local colonial administration. However, although these women contributed to African nationalist politics, they had limited impact as their strategies were concerned with shaming, retaliation, restitution and compensation, and were not directly about radical transformation. This problem was a reflection of the extent to which most African women had already been marginalized politically, economically and educationally under colonial regimes in Africa.S. Geiger, ‘Women and African Nationalism,’ Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 – 244. By countryGambia= In the Gambia, one of the prominent Gambian nationalists and Pan-Africanists during the colonial era was Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof. From the 1950s up to Gambia's independence, Cham Joof (as he is commonly referred to), held a series of campaigns against the British colonial administration. In 1958, he spearheaded the All Party Committee - the purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the Gambia free from European colonialism and neo-colonialism. In 1959, he organised the Bread and Butter demonstration from outside his house in Barthurst now Banjul, and led his followers to Government House to lobby the British colonial administration. Following that demonstration, Cham Joof and his associates Crispin Grey Johnson and M. B. Jones were indicted as \\"inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land\\" and charged as political prisoners.*Foroyaa : Exclusive interview with Foroyaa Panorama (TRIBUTE TO ALHAJI A.E.

It is roughly midway between Dublin and Belfast, very near the County Louth and County Armagh / County Down border. As of the 2016 census, Omeath had a population of 603, up from 439 during the 2006 census. It is approximately from Carlingford and about from Newry. By sea, Omeath's nearest land neighbour is Warrenpoint on the south County Down coast. Omeath is home to the Cúchulainn Gaels Gaelic Athletic Association club. Name The former Omeath railway station It is named after Muireadheach Méith (méith meaning 'the fat') and was originally called Uí Méith Mara, by the sea, to distinguish it from another Ó Méith named after the same man. History Omeath was a village that sprung up around the old Omeath railway station in 1876. The town attracted day trippers from around Northern Ireland and elsewhere, but unlike nearby Warrenpoint, Omeath never became a major residential center. Smuggling was common, especially around the time of the Emergency (WWII). One mid-19th century source reports that the town had little arable land and residents survived mostly by selling fish. Irish language Speakers of Irish existed in Omeath until the middle of the 20th century. The last native speaker of Omeath Irish was Anne O'Hanlon, who died in 1960 aged 89. Although the dialect is now extinct, recordings have been made by German linguist Wilhelm Doegen for the Royal Irish Academy. Transport The town is located on the R173 regional road. Omeath railway station was on the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore railway, which opened on 1 August 1876 and finally closed on 1 January 1952. A regular bus service runs through the village and links the village with Newry and Dundalk town. Bus Éireann Route 161 operates Monday to Friday, and Halpenny Travel operate a service on Sundays with journeys to Dundalk and Newry. In the summer months a regular foot passenger ferry service operates between Omeath and Warrenpoint County Down. Bikes and small motor cycles can also use this service during the summer months.

It is one of the largest petrels that nests in burrows. Description The spectacled petrel is a large, approximately in length, predominately black petrel. It does have white bands around its eyes, and its bill is yellow. Their lifespan averages 26.4 years. Taxonomy The spectacled petrel is a member of the genus Procellaria, and in turn is a member of the family Procellariidae, and the order Procellariiformes. As a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the petrel are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.Double, M. C. (2003) Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988) In 2004, BirdLife International split the spectacled petrel, Procellaria conspicillata, from the white-chinned petrel, Procellaria aequinoctialis, which had been considered conspecific or even a colour morph.Brooke, M. (2004) Etymology Procellaria comes from two Latin words, procella meaning \\"a storm\\" and arius a suffix meaning \\"pertaining to\\". This is in reference to their association with stormy weather. The word petrel is derived from St. Peter and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrel's habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.Gotch, A. T. (1995) BehaviorFeeding= The spectacled petrel eats cephalopods, fish, and crustaceans. =Breeding= This petrel breeds annually and will lay one egg in its nest, which is situated in wet heath above . Their nests are burrows along the banks of rivers, and also in marshes. Range and habitat The spectacled petrel is pelagic and during non-breeding season the majority of these petrels are found off the coast of southern Brazil. They also range east to the west coast of southern Africa, and it is believed that they were found throughout the southern Indian Ocean in the 19th century. During breeding season, they inhabit Inaccessible Island, of the Tristan da Cunha group. In the past, they probably bred on Amsterdam Island as well.BirdLife International (2009) Conservation The species was classified as critically endangered by the IUCN in 2000. A subsequent study gave cautious hope for a continuing recovery of the population from an all-time low of merely some dozens of pairs in the 1930s.Ryan et al. (2006) Indeed, it appears as if the species' numbers have been underestimated in more recent years as an accurate census is difficult due to the rugged terrain of its island home. Consequently, the conservation status of this species was downgraded to vulnerable in the 2007 IUCN Red List. The 2009 assessment maintained their status at vulnerable. This petrel has an occurrence range of and a population estimated at between 31,000 and 45,000. Their population is trending up at between 1% and 9% over 60 years, and possibly 45% over the last five years. The spectacled petrel is threatened by interactions with longline fisheries which kills hundreds of birds every year as they become entangled in the fishing lines and drown. Other threats comes from feral pigs, the black rat and other rat species. The spectacled petrel is listed on CMS Appendix II and ACAP Annex 1. A census was conducted in 2004, and Inaccessible Island is a World Heritage Site, with restricted access. To help the species, other conservation measures have been proposed. Conducting surveys of the breeding population as an ongoing process. Pushing for adoption of the best-practice mitigation measures in fisheries within this birds range, utilizing organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, and International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Restricting access to prevent colonization of introduced species. Finally, looking for other breeding locations.

The bank had a registered capital of and net equity of as at 31 December 2015. History The bank was the brainchild of the Tianjin mayor (and previous head of the Peoples Bank of China) Dai Xianglong who turned a national banking licence for Tianjin, that had been promised to the city in the mid-1990s, into reality and in the process kicking off an important upgrading of the Tianjin financial system. This was the 1st national banking licence to have been approved by the State Council since China Minsheng Bank in 1995. The precondition for the national licence, stipulated by the regulators, was that foreign expertise should be brought in to ensure that the bank could herald a new era for Chinese banking following the modern organisational design of western banks, in particular the risk management system and product development approach. In turn a small set up team was formed from local bank officials, led by Mr Sun Li Guo, and a beauty contest was held for the foreign banking partner. Standard Chartered Hong Kong was selected as Strategic investor and a 19.99% shareholding was agreed. Other investors included TEDA Holding, COSCO, Baosteel Group, State Development & Investment Corporation, with TEDA taking the lead role with a 25% shareholding. The first appointed official of the bank was from Standard Chartered, an Englishman, Mr Simon Page, the chief risk officer who took up the post in October 2004. The head of Wholesale Bank was a Swiss national, Mr Rolf Berweger. A group of officials and technical experts from Standard Chartered Bank joined the set up team and the preparation for the bank began under the guidance of the project director Mr Clive Haswell, pulling together business strategy, technical & IT infrastructure, policies and procedures. In August 2005, the chairman and chief executive were selected, Mr Yang Zi Lin and Mr Ma Teng and the business licence was approved on 31 December 2005. The chief financial officer, Mrs Guo Rong Li, chief technology officer, Mr Liu Zheng Quan, head of Consumer Bank, Mr Phang Yew Kiat were also appointed. The first branch opened in Tianjin on 16 February 2006 and offered basic retail banking deposit services and corporate banking lending, trade and deposit services.

Hostage to Khomeini His 1981 book, Hostage to Khomeini, was commissioned by Lyndon LaRouche. In the book Robert Dreyfuss provides a detailed explanation of why the Carter administration was fooled into supporting the Khomeini revolutionaries but Khomeini backstabbed the US after the Shah was brought to the US for treatment. The book discusses how various officials in the Carter administration believed that an Islamic Iran could export the Islamic revolution to the Soviet Muslims and cause a break-up of the Soviet Union. Dreyfuss accused Cyrus Hashemi of being a CIA and Mossad agent. Cyrus Hashemi subsequently sued Dreyfuss and Lyndon Larouche. The Devil's Game The Devil's Game, published in 2005, is an analysis of how the United States and United Kingdom used Islamists as a powerful weapon against Communists and nationalists in the Arab and non-Arab Muslim world. He believes that the US labelled any nations' leaders who were unwilling to work with the US as Communists. Dreyfuss asserts that the Muslim Brotherhood is historically connected with the CIA and other western intelligence services. He also claims the CIA and the West used the Muslim Brotherhood in an attempt to overthrow President Nasser of Egypt because he nationalized the Suez Canal and kicked many US and European companies out of Egypt. The book makes claims that the Israelis used the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982 in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy President Assad of Syria during the uprisings in Homs and Hama. Lastly Dreyfuss covers the CIA and British backed 1953 Iranian coup d'état.

Monastic life had declined to a low ebb in England in the ninth century, partly because of the ravages caused by Viking attacks, and partly because of a preference for secular clergy, who were cheaper and were thought to serve the spiritual needs of the laity better. Kings from Alfred the Great onwards took an interest in the Benedictine rule, but it was only in the middle of the tenth century that kings became ready to commit substantial funds to its support. Æthelwold became the leading propagandist for the monastic reform movement, although he made enemies by his ruthless methods, and he was more extreme in his opposition to secular clergy than his fellow reformers, Saint Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester. He is nevertheless recognised as a key figure in the reform movement, who also made a major contribution to the revival of learning and the arts. He was an important political figure, backing Æthelred the Unready against Edward the Martyr, and playing a major advisory role during Æthelred's minority.Yorke \\"Æthelwold\\"Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform pp. 141–154. Early life Æthelwold was born to noble parents in Winchester. From the late 920s he served in a secular capacity at the court of King Athelstan, and according to Æthelwold's biographer, Wulfstan, \\"he spent a long time in the royal burh there as the king's inseparable companion, learning much from the king's witan that was useful and profitable to him\\".Quoted in Foot, Æthelstan, p. 107 The king arranged for him to be ordained a priest by Ælfheah the Bald, Bishop of Winchester, on the same day as Saint Dunstan. After a period in the late 930s studying under Ælfheah at Winchester, Æthelwold moved to Glastonbury Abbey, where Dunstan had been made abbot. Here Æthelwold studied grammar, metrics and patristics, subsequently being made dean. During the reign of King Eadred (946–955), Æthelwold wished to travel to Europe to learn more about the monastic life, but Eadred refused permission, and instead appointed him abbot of the former monastic site of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, which was then served by secular priests. The years he spent in Abingdon were extremely productive, and he undertook the building of a church, the rebuilding of the cloister and the establishment at Abingdon of the Benedictine Rule. When Eadred died, he was succeeded by his nephew, Eadwig, who drove Eadred's chief advisor, Dunstan, into exile. However, Æthelwold attended Eadwig's court in at least some of the years of his reign, 955–59. The future King Edgar had been taught from boyhood by Æthelwold, who evidently inspired his pupil to take an interest in the rule of Saint Benedict. When Eadwig died, Æthelwold naturally backed Edgar's succession.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform p. 145 He seems to have been in the personal service of King Edgar in 960–963, as he wrote many of the charters of this period. Bishop of Winchester The Entry into Jerusalem from the Benedictional of Saint Æthelwold (British Library) On 29 November 963, Æthelwold was consecrated Bishop of Winchester, and the following year, with the connivance of King Edgar and the support of an armed force led by a royal official, he had the clerics of the Winchester Old and New Minsters expelled and replaced by monks from Abingdon. The king had sought the permission of the pope for the expulsion the previous autumn. Between 964 and 971, Æthelwold refounded monasteries at Chertsey, Milton Abbas, Peterborough, Ely and Thorney, and the Nunnaminster nunnery in Winchester. He was also zealous in recovering land which he believed had once belonged to religious communities and subsequently been alienated, and if necessary charters were forged to prove claims to title. Æthelwold was one of the principal advocates for the Benedictine reform movement during Edgar's reign, the author of all the major works of propaganda produced in England. He had the strong support of Edgar and his wife, Ælfthryth, and his works emphasise the role of Edgar, who he saw as Christ's representative, in restoring the monasteries. He envisaged a major role for Edgar in supervising monasteries, and for Queen Ælthryth supervising Benedictine nunneries.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth- Century English Benedictine Reform pp. 146–150 However, he was more extreme in his espousal of monasticism than Dunstan and Oswald, the other great leaders of monasticism in the reign of King Edgar. They followed continental practice in maintaining both monks and secular priests in their households, and did not follow Æthelwold in his dramatic expulsions of secular clerks and replacement by monks. Æthelwold links the terms 'filth' and 'clergy' several times in his writings, regarding them (like other Benedictines) as impure and unfit to serve altars or engage in any form of divine service, because many of them were married and they did not follow a monastic rule.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform p. 150. To Æthelwold's admirers, the epithets \\"father of monks\\" and \\"benevolent bishop\\" summarize his character as reformer and friend of Christ's poor;Catholic Online Saints and Angels: St. Ethelwold accessed on 5 September 2007 though he suffered much from ill- health, his life as scholar, teacher, prelate and Royal counsellor was ever austere, and he was said to be \\"terrible as a lion\\" to the rebellious, yet \\"gentler than a dove\\" to the meek. He is said to have written a treatise on the circle and to have compiled the \\"Regularis Concordia\\".Walsh A New Dictionary of Saints p. 184 The Benedictines were greatly superior to the secular clergy in their learning and their schools. Æthelwold personally taught the older pupils at Winchester, and their works show that they regarded him with great respect and affection. His surviving works in both Latin and Old English show that he was a great scholar, and his vernacular writings are believed to have played an important role in the development of Standard Old English. Some of the wealth he accumulated was used to rebuild churches, and he was also a major patron of ecclesiastical art, although unfortunately none of his works survive, and only written accounts remain. The artistic workshops he established continued to be influential after his death, both at home and abroad. A century later Æthelwold had acquired a great reputation as a goldsmith, and was credited with the production of a range of metal objects at Abingdon, including many figures and objects in precious metal, bells and even a pipe organ. While his later, disreputable successor at Abingdon Spearhafoc clearly was, like Dunstan, a significant artist, that Wulfstan's contemporary Life of Æthelwold mentions him undertaking other forms of manual work, in the gardens and in building, but nothing about metalwork, suggests this legend was a later elaboration, though one that shows the high status of goldsmithing at the time.Wulfstan of Winchester Life of St. Æthelwold, Lapidge, M. & Winterbottom, M. (eds.), OUP, 1991; Dodwell: 49–50. Æthelwold was certainly bishop during the period when the Winchester school of manuscript illumination reached its peak, and the most important surviving manuscript of the school, the Benedictional of Saint Æthelwold (British Library), was commissioned by him. He also rebuilt the Old Minster at Winchester, completed in 980. Political role Æthelwold also played an important political role. When the succession became an issue late in Edgar's reign, Æthelwold supported the claim of Æthelred, the son of his major patron, Ælfthryth, whereas Dunstan and Oswald appear to have supported Edgar's son by an earlier wife, Edward the Martyr, who succeeded to the throne. After Edward was murdered in 978, Æthelwold seems to have played a major advisory role in Æthelred's minority. It is significant that it was only after Æthelwold's death in 984 that Æthelred started acting against the interests of some of the reformed monastic houses. One victim was Abingdon Abbey, and in a charter restoring its privileges in 993 the king acknowledged that Æthelwold's passing had deprived the country \\"of one whose industry and pastoral care ministered not only to my interest but also to that of all the inhabitants of the country.\\"Keynes Æthelred II Death and reputation Æthelwold died on 1 August 984Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 223 at Beddington in Surrey. He was buried in the crypt of the Old Minster at Winchester, but twelve years later Ælfhelm, a citizen of Wallingford, claimed to have been cured of blindness by visiting Æthelwold's tomb. This was taken as the necessary sign for his formal recognition as a saint, and his body was translated from the crypt to the choir. By the 12th century, Abingdon Abbey had acquired an arm and a leg.Royal Berkshire History, Abingdon Relics One of Æthelwold's pupils, Wulfstan of Winchester, wrote a biography which seems to have played a major role in promoting his cult, and in about 1004 Ælfric, another disciple and abbot of Eynsham, abridged Wulfstan's work in Latin and Old English.Lapidge, M. et al. (eds.), The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, Blackwell, 2004, pp.19, 494. For Ælfric's Vita S. Æthelwoldi, see Winterbottom, M. (ed.), Three Lives of English Saints, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Toronto, 1972, and Stevenson, J. (ed.), Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, Rolls Series, London, 1858, II, 255–266 (online at Google Books. Retrieved 1 March 2010). However, the Æthelwold of Wulfstan's life inspired respect rather than devotion, and his cult never seems to have achieved great popularity. Wulfstan's saint is a formidable authoritarian, who, for instance, commands a monk to show his devotion by plunging his hand into a pot of boiling stew. He has a reputation for ruthless insensitivity which is not shared by the other tenth-century monastic reformers. His importance to the reform movement has always been appreciated, but the range of his contributions to scholarship has only been recognised in recent years. Æthelwold's liturgical feast is kept on 1 August,Farmer, David Hugh, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, 1987, pp. 150-2, or on 19 May in the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter.Divine Worship: The Missal p. 734 NotesCitationsReferences *Anglo- Saxons.net Charter S567 accessed on 5 September 2007 *Barrow, Julia, The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine 'Reform', in Patricia Skinner (ed.), Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History: The Legacy of Timothy Reuter, 2009, Brepols, *Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909: St. Ethelwold * *Catholic Online Saints and Angels: St. Ethelwold accessed on 5 September 2007 *Foot, Sarah (2011) Æthelstan: The First King of England, Yale University Press * *Lambertson, Reader Isaac.

Its scientific name derives from Ancient Greek: Pterodroma originates from pteron and dromos, meaning \\"wing\\" and \\"runner\\", and phaeopygia comes from phaios and pugios, meaning \\"dusky\\" and \\"rump\\". Members of Pterodroma genus are also called the gadfly petrels because their erratic twisting and turning in flight resemble that of gadflies. Known by locals as pata pegada or \\"web-footed one\\", Galápagos petrels are highly adapted to the ocean and spend most of their time at sea eating invertebrates and fish. At sea, they are indistinguishable from the Hawaiian petrels: consequently, they were considered the same species for a while. When breeding season arises, they return to their large colonies located on the highlands of some Galápagos islands. The populations of Galápagos petrels have declined substantially over the last three generations (60 years) due to anthropogenic disturbances. Introduced predation (i.e. feral cats, dogs, pigs, and rats) and agricultural expansion have decreased the species' overall breeding success, survivability, and quality of habitats and nesting colonies. Although many conservation efforts are underway, its populations are currently still declining with an estimate of 6,000-15,000 mature individuals remaining. The species is now classified under “critically endangered” in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  Description  The preserve specimen of the Galápagos petrel displays dark-gray upperparts and white underparts with some black freckling on the face. The brown tinge is due to abrasion. It also has a hooked bill that is adapted for manipulating their prey. The Galápagos and Hawaiian petrel are really similar. They are large, long-winged gadfly petrels with an overall dark-gray topside which darkens gradually towards the tip of the wings and tail. A narrow white line on each side of their rump is often present. The species are also characterized by a distinct black hood that extends to the sides of their neck. In contrast, their face and underparts are white, but the underwings have black margins and a diagonal bar that extends from the coverts to near the base of the wings. While all Hawaiian petrels have entirely white foreheads, many Galápagos petrels have black freckles. Also, their legs and feet are pink and the webbings, black. Galápagos petrels do not exhibit sexual dimorphism, and juveniles are indistinguishable from the adults. Although adult petrels sometimes acquire a brown tinge due to abrasion, their feathers remain relatively similar throughout the year. Plus, the molting details are not well-known, but it seems like most feathers are replaced during the non- breeding season. Furthermore, like all gadfly petrels, Galápagos petrels have short, stout, hooked bills with sharp edges that are used to seize, manipulate and cut up small prey. One of the most remarkable features in this group, however, is that all have external tubular nostrils, suggesting that they have developed an ability to smell, detect and locate their food. They can even find their nest burrow within the colony in the dark. Despite all the similarities, there are also some subtle differences between the Galápagos and Hawaiian petrel. Galápagos petrels appear to have longer and narrower bills than the Hawaiian form. They are also lighter (i.e. average for the Galápagos petrel is 420 g, whereas the Hawaiian petrel is 434 g) but have longer wings and tarsi. However, their total wing area and weight-to-wing area ratio are slightly lower than that of Hawaiian petrels, hence Galápagos petrels have lower flight speeds but more agility.  Taxonomy  Illustration of the head of Pterodroma lessoni. Here, the hooked bill and external tubular nostrils are also found in the Galápagos petrel. The Galápagos petrel is one of the 35 species of gadfly petrels within the family Procellariidae and order Procellariiformes. This is one of the most primitive bird orders, and all of its members are collectively referred to as \\"petrels\\". Taxonomically, its genus and family are extremely complex and are often subject to revision. Indeed, the Procellariidae display a slower rate of speciation compared to other bird groups. Although they are now widely distributed around the world, it appears to have differentiated from the other Procellariiformes over 40-50 million years ago in the Southern Hemisphere. A DNA study revealed that the closest relatives to the petrels are the divers, penguins, and frigatebirds. However, many members of family are still poorly known, as it is the case with the Galápagos petrel. The species was first described as Estrelata phaeopygia by Salvin in 1876. In 1918, he renamed the Galápagos petrel because he thought it was a conspecific of the Hawaiian petrel (i.e. together, they were also known as the Dark-rumped petrel); hence it became known as Pterodroma phaeopygia phaeopygia. However, their genetic variation, their geographical separation and their morphological and behavioral differences provided enough evidence to split them into two unique species. The Galápagos petrels were finally elevated to a species taxon as Pterodroma phaeopygia. Plus, recent studies found that some genetic, morphometric and behavioural differences also exist among individual island populations of the Galápagos petrel. It appears that the Isabela population recently derived from the Santiago population, and the San Cristobal population is a combination of all the other populations.  Habitat and distribution  Distribution of the Galápagos petrel. It nests on five islands including Isabela, Santiago, Floreana, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. The Galápagos petrel is endemic to the Galápagos Islands. They are mainly distributed in the Galápagos Marine Reserve area, but studies revealed that individuals frequently leave the reserve and disperse northeast towards South America and up to 2000 km southwards in the period between January and February. Like other gadfly petrels, these subtropical seabirds are highly pelagic and are maladapted to the terrestrial habitats. Therefore, they are usually found far from the land and will only return to their nest to breed. The nesting colonies are distributed among five islands: Santiago, Floreana, Isabela, Santa Cruz, and San Cristobal, which are all less than 170 km apart. Multiple colonies can occur within one island; each can be as large as 200 m by 300 m and are separated by a distance that varies from 300 m to 5 km. Nowadays, the Galápagos petrels commonly nest on offshore islets because their habitats have been destroyed or displaced by anthropogenic disturbances. Their nests typically occur in highlands that are at least 180 m above the sea. Most can also be found in thickly vegetated sites where the soil is soft enough to burrow deep cavities, but some individuals also choose to nest in volcanic crevices. These ground nests make the species more vulnerable to introduced predators.  Behavior  Two Galápagos petrels flying together. In general, all Procellarids are very mobile and can travel long distances for several months. However, it is still unclear what behavior they exhibit when it is not the breeding season. Sometimes, petrels aggregate around shoals or other rich food sources. All procellarids are adapted to the ocean but not so much to the land. As a result, they only frequent landmasses for a prolonged period during the breeding season. Also, these petrels are gregarious and typically form large discrete breeding colonies. The Galápagos petrels are highly philopatric, meaning that every year they return to their natal colony or the same nesting site with the same partner. Many petrels have nocturnal habits, including the Galápagos form. Indeed, they forage in the evenings and return to feed their offspring during the day. They often fly just above the water to feed on their prey without diving in. Courtship also occurs in the night and the petrels are often seen towering into the sky and flying erratically as a display to attract a female. = Diet = A Galápagos petrel flying over the water. Galápagos petrels are adapted to make efficient use of food resources which are typically distant from the colonies, patchily distributed and have low nutritive value. The petrels mainly take mesopelagic prey such as squids, small fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates. These are presumably taken at night because that is when some of the prey migrate vertically to feed at the surface; although sometimes, they are driven to the surface by tunas and porpoises. Plus, some of their prey (about 82% in number and 75% by mass) are bioluminescent, which may help the species detect them at night. Galápagos petrels catch and eat them while flying. During the nesting season, the parents take turn to feed the chick by regurgitating their meal. A study of the chicks' stomach content revealed that they are fed semi-digested seafood mixed with a large amount of high-caloric stomach oils produced by the parent. These oils are the main source of energy and water for the offspring. Interestingly, the feeding rates are highest during the month that follows hatching but decreases as they prepare to fledge. This much energy is required in young birds to develop their thermoregulatory ability, and their mass- specific metabolic rate is also the highest during that time. = Vocalization = Most gadfly petrels tend to remain silent at sea, but become very vocal at night when they are near their breeding colony. Also, during communal courtship, they often emit various shrill cries. Moreover, from the inside of their burrow, they typically produce different crooning or growling notes and some moaning cries. Studies reported that the Galápagos petrels call from after sunset until dawn on all islands. This occurs when they circle or fly out of their colonies and during high-speed chases. Their calls increase the most just before sunrise when the birds are the most numerous in the sky. However, one study also noted that they were silent for most of the night and only began calling before sunrise (i.e. 6 AM). The main flight call recorded sounded like “kee-kee-kee-(c)ooo” with the last note drawn out. The Galápagos petrels mainly use three flight calls. There is a short 3-5 syllable call that may be used for identification; a long call of 6-20 syllables for aggressive or defensive situations; and a single-syllable call for very stressful situations. The short and long call are sexually dimorphic: calls in males are sweet and pleasant but are coarser and grating in females. Interestingly, individuals of different islands also have call differences that distinguish them. In comparison to the Hawaiian petrel, their vocalizations are quite different. = Reproduction = Galápagos petrel flying overland. Pterodroma species reach sexual maturity at age 5-6 and generally nest once every year from then on. The breeding season occurs at a different time for different Galápagos petrel populations. In Santa Cruz and Santiago, the season starts from March to January; in Isabela, from the end of April to January; in Floreana, from October to August; and in San Cristobal, from May to October. Although some seasons overlap, there is little to no interbreeding between populations. These populations have likely diverged from each other because of their rigid cycle and high fidelity to their mate and nesting site. Mature individuals dig or take up abandoned rabbit burrows and prepare for nesting by enlarging their burrow and gathering dry vegetation. When finding their life- long partner, male gadfly petrels have different displays to attract females. They exhibit elaborate courtship flights that include aerial chasing, high- speed swoops, and towering which are accompanied by loud calls. Breeding pairs associate in their burrow and engage in mutual preening and series of calls. After copulation, they return to the sea to feed abundantly in preparation for the gestation period and the subsequent long incubation period. During this time, which lasts approximately two weeks, each of the pair will pay short visits to the nest so that others do not think it is deserted. View of Island area. Floreana island is one the nesting sites of the Galápagos petrel. Each pair lays one egg that is white and ovate. In a study, the eggs weighed about 17 or 20% of the female body weight, but on average eggs weigh 20-24% of that in all gadfly petrels. The incubation period is about 50 days, and the male and female take turns to incubate the egg for an average of 12 days. While the incubating parents are losing an average of 10-15 g per day, the others are foraging at sea with no evidence that they return to feed their partners. Although the eggs are rarely left unattended, both parents will sometimes leave the nest to forage when food is scarce. As an adaptation to this, the eggs are resistant to the cold. However, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus) prey on the eggs. Upon hatching, chicks are covered by an off-white down on the front and sides of the throat, as well as the center of the belly. Parents take turns feeding them, and they quickly become fat, exceeding the weight of their parents. The Galápagos petrel chicks have also adapted to the scarcity of food as they are resistant to starvation. The second down appears after around 10 days and the feathers, after 5 weeks. Once the chicks are fully feathered and look like molted adults, parents stop their visits. Overall, their nesting success is low.

() is a Japanese entertainment conglomerate led by founder Max Matsuura and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Founded in 1988, the company manages J-pop talents like Ayumi Hamasaki and internet sensation PikoTaro. It has also shifted into other business domains like anime, video games and live music events, partnering with Ultra Music Festival and hosting the annual A-nation. The company is a member of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) keiretsu. Name Avex is an acronym of the English words Audio Visual Expert. Since its foundation, its corporate name was Avex D.D., Incorporated, and ten years later it was changed to Avex, Incorporated. The current name, Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated, was adopted in 2004 as part of reconstruction process after Tom Yoda's resignation. Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated was used for the main subsidiaries, while the old name (Avex, Incorporated) was for entertainment components of the Group. In 2005, Avex, Incorporated became Avex Entertainment, Incorporated, and stayed on as part of the Group. History The , finished in 2002 and funded by Sumitomo Life, in Minami-Aoyama, Tokyo. It was vacated in October 2014 to give way to the move to Izumi Garden Tower. The Izumi Garden Tower in Roppongi. Avex Group moved to the 36th floor of the tower on October 1, 2014. Avex Group logo used from 2000–2017 =1988–1999: The early years= Avex was registered June 1, 1973 as , although it did not become established until 1988. They began as a CD wholesaler based in Machida, Tokyo.:ja:エイベックス・グループ Avex Group's article on the Japanese Wikipedia. In September 1990, they opened a recording studio and created Avex Trax as a music label. In the same year, they created \\"Musique Folio Inc.\\", a music publishing company, which became \\"Prime Direction Inc.\\" During their early years, Avex operated as an indies label, but had an especially close relationship with the Sanwa keiretsu; 2.8% of shares of Avex were held by Sanwa Bank, in turn 1.15% of shares of Sanwa Bank were held by Hitachi. In 1993, they transferred to Aoyama, Tokyo and created a U.S. branch, called \\"AV Experience America Inc.\\" The year also marked the first of Avex's yearly events. It was held in Tokyo Dome under the name \\"avex rave '93\\" and attracted 50,000 attendees. This led to the creation of the Cutting Edge label. In 1994, they formed two UK subsidiaries, \\"Rhythm Republic Limited\\" and \\"Avex U.K. Limited.\\" Later that year, they opened a disco, claimed on their website to be \\"the world's largest scale disco\\", named Velfarre. In 1997, they opened a series of concert halls called \\"Zepp\\" with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. In early 1999, they signed an agreement with Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records to handle the companies' Japanese CD releases. Later that year \\"Avex Mode\\", an animation company, was established. In December, the company was listed on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 7860. =2000–2009: Times of unity and divisiveness= In 2001, Avex opened the \\"avex artists academy\\" music school. In 2002, they released the \\"CCCD\\", a type of copy-protected CD, and opened their building in Aoyama, paid for by Sumitomo Life and worth 205 billion yen. In 2003, they opened a classical music business (named Avex Classics). In January 2004, they began selling Japanese music CDs in South Korea. In December of that same year, President Max Matsuura \\"spotted\\" former idol Ami Suzuki performing live at the annual festival of their school, Nihon University. He subsequently signed her to the Avex label. In 2005, Avex acquired distribution rights for Aozora Records' catalogue including all future Hitomi Yaida releases. In early 2008, Avex partnered with Victor JVC to officially create the label D-topia Entertainment as a business partnership between the labels and its founder, Terukado Onishi, with the sales promotion handled by Victor while the area promotion handled by Avex. As part of the Avex Group's 20th anniversary celebration, a big project occurred with avex trax's \\"produced by avex trax\\" artists; the band Girl Next Door, formed and debuted in September 2008. Avex Group launched its own IPTV service, BeeTV, May 2009 in partnership with NTT DoCoMo. 2004: Internal feud : Max Matsuura v. Tom Yoda In August 2004, a feud between Max Matsuura and co-founder Tom Yoda affected the group. It started because of Yoda's ambition to expand Avex into other entertainment- related ventures, especially producing movies. In addition, he accused Ryuhei Chiba, the company's executive director and president of Avex Inc. (now Avex Planning and Development), of pursuing personal profit from a few big artists. July 30: In a board meeting, Yoda introduced a resolution calling on Chiba to resign because of an alleged conflict of interest. A source says the disagreement arose because Chiba had signed an artist managed by a member of his family. The board backed Yoda's resolution in a 6-1 vote. However, Matsuura — described by insiders as a close ally of Chiba — introduced a second resolution demanding that Yoda step down due to \\"a difference of opinion in management principles\\". Matsuura's motion was defeated 5-2. He and Chiba resigned the next day. August 2: Matsuura and Chiba announced their resignations in a meeting with employees of Avex. Chiba denied any fault, while Matsuura complained that Avex had lost its love of music and said he wanted to start over. They had the support of many staff who also said they would quit. More significantly, the label's top star, Ayumi Hamasaki, said she would leave. As a result, Avex's stocks in the TSE fell by 16 percent that day. August 3: Due to pressure by employees and artists and to save the company from bankruptcy, Yoda resigned and was replaced by Toshio Kobayashi. =2010–present= AGHD is listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Börse München of Germany under the ticker symbol AX8. More K-pop artists from other agencies continued to sign with Avex such as SM Entertainment's TVXQ (2006), YG Entertainment's 2NE1 (2010), S-plus Entertainment's SS501 member Kim Hyung Jun (2011), Pledis Entertainment's After School (2011), NH Media's U-KISS (2011) and Yejeon Media's Shu-I (2011). On July 21, 2011, it was announced that Avex had paired with Korean management label YG Entertainment to form YGEX Entertainment. In 2012, the group began offering limited releases for sale, DRM-free for the first time within Japan on Amazon MP3. Max Matsuura and Toshio Kobayashi, the company's top two individual shareholders, launched their own investment companies to anchor their shares in 2012. As a show of modernization, Avex Group moved to Izumi Garden Tower in Roppongi in October 2014. The company was designated to the 36th floor – the former address of DWANGO. On February 15, 2017, Avex Group discontinued all foreign exports of Blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs published under their Avex Pictures label. The company provided no official statement on the decision. OperationsSubsidiaries= In April 2010, the Avex Group corporation was re-structured to establish Avex Music Publishing Inc. as a consolidated subsidiary, in a corporate spin-off of music publishing division of Avex Group Holdings Inc.

He batted .301 lifetime and set a major league record for career games in right field, as well as retiring among the career leaders in total games (5th, 1813), assists (9th, 264) and double plays (5th, 69) as an outfielder. Donovan batted and threw left-handed. Early years Born in Queenstown, County Cork, Donovan established himself as the most successful Irish-born major leaguer. He broke into organized baseball in with the Lawrence, Massachusetts team in the New England League. Minor league career In and , Donovan played outfield for the London Tecumsehs of the International Association at Tecumseh Park (today's Labatt Park) in London, Ontario, Canada, where, in his first season in 1888, he led the league in batting with a .359 batting average (according to the Donovan family Web site; however, the London Tecumsehs' official scorer C. J. Moorehead, in a 1903 copy of The London Advertiser, cited Donovan's 1888 batting average as .398), had 201 hits, scored 103 runs and stole 80 bases. His second season with the Tecumsehs was less successful due to a leg injury. Major league career In 1890 he made his major league debut in the National League (NL) with the Boston Beaneaters, and moved to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in midseason; it would be the only time in his career that he played for a league champion. In he played in the American Association (AA) for the Louisville Colonels and Washington Statesmen; he then returned to the NL in , first with the Senators (the former Statesmen, who had joined the NL in a league merger) before going to the Pirates for most of the year. Donovan starred with the Pirates from through , notching six consecutive seasons batting .300 and serving as player-manager in and . The team was sold late in 1899, during a time when the league was contracting from twelve teams to eight; new owner Barney Dreyfuss brought in Fred Clarke to be manager, with Donovan being sent to the Cardinals. He played for St. Louis from -, sharing the league lead in stolen bases (45) in his first season, also managing the team in his last three seasons with them. By the end of the 1903 season he ranked among the NL's top ten career leaders in hits and at bats, though he would drop from among the leaders before his playing career ended. His 64 career double plays in the NL ranked one behind Jimmy Ryan's league record. He then served as player-manager for the American League's Washington Senators in 1904, his last season as a regular. In 1903, he broke Sam Thompson's major league record of 1401 games in right field; Willie Keeler passed him in 1906, before Donovan played his last several games and retired with a total of 1620. In , he became manager of the Brooklyn Superbas, and made his last few playing appearances that year, along with one more game at the end of the season. In a 17-season playing career, Donovan had 2256 hits, 1321 runs, 16 home runs and 738 runs batted in in 1824 games, along with 208 doubles and 75 triples. Donovan collected 302 stolen bases from 1890 to 1897, and 216 more after the statistic was revised to its modern definition in 1898. Post-playing career Donovan joined the Boston Red Sox as a scout in , and managed the team in and . As a major league manager, he compiled a 684-879 record (.438) in 11 seasons. He was also instrumental in bringing Babe Ruth to the Sox in through his acquaintance with one of the Xaverian Brothers who coached Ruth at a Baltimore orphans' home. Later he went to the International League, where he led Buffalo to pennants in and , and also managed Jersey City in 1921–22 and 1925–26. In 1929 and 1930, Donovan managed the Orleans town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1930 one of his charges at Orleans was future New York Yankees legend Red Rolfe. In a 1930 old-timers' game at Braves Field in Boston, Donovan had a pinch hit single, at the age of 65.http://admin.goterriers.com/sports/2016/6/13/braves-nickerson-100-moments- html.aspx He finished out his career coaching High School baseball at Phillips Academy in Andover, where he coached the future 41st President, George H.W. Bush. Donovan died at the age of 88 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Christmas Day 1953, and is interred at St. Mary Cemetery in Lawrence.

He played a role in the victory of the Communist Party of China over the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, in his capacity as private secretary and aide-de-camp to Hu Zongnan, one of the most senior Nationalist generals; Xiong was secretly a Communist mole and for many years passed highly sensitive information to the Communist Party leadership, including top-secret orders and documents of Chiang Kai-Shek. After 1949 he held important diplomatic posts, serving as chargé d'affaires to the United Kingdom and ambassador to Mexico. His career culminated in the 1970s and 1980s, when he was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Investigation Department (the primary Chinese civilian intelligence agency at the time) from 1973 to 1982, and Vice Chairman and Party Secretary of the multi-billion China International Trust Investment Corporation (CITIC) from 1982 to 1987. Life Born in Laizhou, Shandong, Xiong Xianghui came from a prominent family with roots in Fengyang County, Anhui. His father was a high-ranking judge who served as President of the High Court of both Hubei and Hunan provinces. In 1936 Xiong began studying at the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Tsinghua University, where he was secretly recruited to the Communist Party of China. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Xiong was ordered by the Communist Party to rush to Changsha in order to sign up for the Hunan Youth Battlefield Service Corps headed by Li Fanglan in General Hu Zongnan's First Army, in the hope of successfully penetrating the Nationalist military. Because of his strong family connections and his own skill and cleverness, Xiong caught the eye of Hu Zongnan who first sent him to study at the accelerated course of the Central Military Academy (which lasted a year) and, after his graduation as an infantry second lieutenant, named Xiong his private secretary (or mishu) and aide-de-camp. For the next 9 years, until 1947, Xiong would secretly pass countless top-secret documents to the Communist leadership. His most critical contribution came in March 1947, when Hu Zongnan, under orders from Chiang Kai-Shek, moved to attack Yan'an. Although Hu was successful in the \\"lighting attack\\" operation to sack Yan'an, he was unable to capture or kill the CCP leadership, as Xiong Xianghui had secretly managed to warn the CCP leadership two weeks prior to the Nationalist assault. Xiong's warning gave the CCP leadership enough time to relocate to Zhangjiakou. Xiong had also provided the CCP with Hu's battle plans and elements of private conversations he had overheard with Chiang Kai-shek, which would cause immense damage to Hu's forces and to the wider Nationalist war effort thereafter. In late 1947 Hu Zongnan (still completely unaware of Xiong's secret Communist allegiance) sent Xiong to study abroad, at Western Reserve University in the United States, where Xiong stayed until 1949, earning a master's degree in Social Sciences. Xiong had a long diplomatic career after returning to China, ultimately serving in key posts and alongside Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, with whom he had a lifelong friendship.

History  Co-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by John Heron who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey UK, and Tom and Dency Sargent from Hartford (Conn., USA). (First published by Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey, Guildford in 1974) The CCI break was ideological and CCI developed in significantly different ways in practice, theory and organisation. The first gatherings of CCI co-counsellors took place in 1974 in the USA and in Europe and annual international gatherings have taken place in both locations since then. The European gatherings currently rotate between Germany, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands and UK. John Heron's status within the network has always been as an equal member, although inevitably as a founder member, activist for some 15 years and the person who developed much of the thinking behind CCI there was a certain amount of transference on to him. He now lives in New Zealand and has an involvement with the CCI network there. There is no imperative in CCI to evangelise and so the network has spread somewhat slowly and haphazardly. In the USA the network existed for many years mainly in and around Connecticut but it is now spreading to other parts of the country. Outside of Europe and the USA the main development has been in New Zealand where there is now an active network and they hold their own series of international gatherings.  Practice  In CCI the person in the client role is wholly in charge of the session. The counsellor only intervenes in accordance with one of three levels of “contract” - free attention, normal and intensive – which are defined in CCI's principles. The only requirement of the counsellor is that they give “free attention” - that is full supportive attention – to the client. The other two contracts constitute invitations to the counsellor to make interventions from within those permitted if they feel it is appropriate. Clients in CCI may and do draw on a wide range of therapeutic activities that can be used self- directedly as well as the cathartic discharge - re-evaluation activities.  Organisation  CCI is a peer network with no core structure, classes and activities are organized by individuals or groups acting self-directedly. The network consists of individuals and groups who agree to a set of ideas about what CCI is. Although it has no formal status, the principles outlined in A Definition of CCI have stood the test of time as a necessary and sufficient statement of those ideas. Organisation within the network varies from place to place. In some parts of the world there are structured organisations at national or local level, or both, with a variety of organizational structures and requirements for membership, e.g. the payment of subscriptions, in addition to being members of CCI. In other places the network has no fixed structure and co-counsellors organise in an ad hoc way. The network is currently active in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, UK and USA. There are also groups or contacts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Iceland and Spain. Members of the active parts of the network generally organise local and national gatherings of co-counsellors in addition to the international gatherings. These gatherings are usually self-creating, in other words there is no pre organised programme, facilitators or speakers. Facilitation rotates between volunteers or sometimes even plenary sessions are peer facilitated. Plenary sessions are mainly about organising the business of the day, as part of which anyone who wants to suggest or offer to facilitate a \\"workshop\\" explains their idea. The workshops cover a wide range of topics from applying co-counselling to a range of issues e.g. depression or gender issues, to trying out other approaches to personal development such as meditation or cognitive behavioural therapy. Some of the sessions may be training, e.g. in assertiveness, while others may be for games, music or dance. Generally there is a choice of things to do, including having co- counselling sessions or just socialising. The events generally have to be self-financing with the participants paying the costs of accommodation, food and any necessary administration. In addition to these events, individuals or groups of co-counsellors organise a range of ad hoc themed or facilitated activities. These can range from residential training courses for which the facilitator would be paid to day or half day sessions on a theme such as money or eating. A number of local newsletters are produced to keep co-counsellors in contact, let them know about events and spread news, ideas and experiences. The practice is not to edit contributions to these newsletters and they may contain personal experiences as well as private lists of co-counsellors. For these reasons they are generally confidential and not available to non co- counsellors. CCI does, however, have a fairly active public web presence.  Culture  CCI has no rules to cover anything outside of co-counselling sessions, so the manner in which co-counsellors relate to one another is up to them. New co-counsellors are usually alerted to the possibility that they may develop strong feelings about people they counsel with and are advised to stick to co-counselling with them until they have a clearer idea about what is going on. Gatherings of co-counsellors are somewhat like temporary intentional communities and co-counsellors generally seem to be able to relate and organise very effectively in a no rules environment. In principle, i.e. according to the principles of CCI, any CCI co-counsellor may teach it. In practice local organisations tend to exercise oversight over people teaching in their area and people offering to teach are expected to have some training. In addition, people putting themselves forward to teach CCI co-counselling are generally publicly known (a number are listed on CCI websites) and are open to be challenged by anyone who has concerns about what they are doing. Supervision of activities in the network occurs along panocratic lines (see panocracy), in other words it is the responsibility of all CCI co-counsellors. An important way that this takes place is through local, national and international gatherings of co-counsellors. In general these gatherings are open to all members of CCI so that even local events may be attended by co- counsellors from other parts of the country or the world. Any differences are usually highlighted at these events and resolved through creative problem solving.  References  * .

It is endemic to the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, and until recently was restricted to the 218-hectare Rangatira or South-East Island. Description Illustration by Joseph Smit, 1896 The Chatham petrel is a medium-sized petrel with a mottled dark-grey and white forehead, dark grey back and upper wings, and white underparts. A black diagonal bar extends from the leading edge of underwing to a black ‘armpit’. The shoulders and upper-wing coverts are a deeper grey giving a dark M pattern across the spread upper wings. The bill is black and strongly hooked tip. The eye is dark, and the legs and feet are pink, with dark outer toes and webs. The sexes are alike. Chatham petrels are rarely observed away from the colony; the few at-sea records are from ships in oceanic waters. Breeding Chatham petrel in nesting box, on egg Chatham petrels nest in burrows under the forest canopy to which they are generally faithful to over time. Leaves are used as nesting material. Each pair lays a single white egg in December or January and the chicks fledge in May or June. Status and threats The population is estimated at 2,000 birds and is classified as nationally vulnerable. Present throughout the Chatham group before the arrival of man, predation by man and introduced mammals (rats and cats) and the loss of forest habitat saw the species restricted to Rangatira island. Before conservation efforts began, the size of the Rangatira population was limited by burrow competition with the broad-billed prion Pachyptila vittata, of which an estimated 330,000 pairs inhabit the island. =Conservation management= Conservation efforts for the Chatham petrel started in the late 1980s, the initial focus of which was locating burrows and determining the cause of breeding failure. Once it was determined that burrow competition from broad-billed prions was causing most breeding attempts to fail, attention shifted to protection of burrows and chicks from prion interference. Burrows are located using telemetry - adult birds caught on the surface are fitted with a small transmitter and tracked to their burrows. Burrows are then protected by installing a plastic or wooden artificial burrow (to guard against collapse) and protected from prion entry by the fitting of a neoprene flap over the burrow entrance. Burrows are also blocked over the non-breeding period to ensure they are not occupied by prions during the petrels' winter absence. In the 2005/06 breeding season of the 155 known breeding pairs on Rangatira, 83% were successful in fledging their chick. The transfer of 200 chicks to a predator-proof fenced area on nearby Pitt Island/Rangiauria over the four years 2002-05 has seen the return of small number of birds to the site and the first breeding occur (with the fledging of 1 chick) in the 2005/06 season and four breeding pairs in 2006/07. The transfer of 200 chicks over four years to a predator-proof fenced site on the South coast of Chatham Island started in April 2008 with the translocation of 47 chicks.

The Enterprise was a gas inflated aerostat built by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe along with his father Clovis Lowe in 1858. It was the second balloon built by Lowe at his Hoboken, N.J. facility and named with the express approval of his wife Leontine because of the money and time they put into creating it. The Enterprise was built of the India silk, lightweight cording, and Lowe's patent (recipe kept secret) varnish which could keep the balloon envelope gassed up for as long as two weeks.Mary Hoehling, p. 46.  Cincinnati to South Carolina  The Enterprise was one in a set of smaller balloons taken to Cincinnati in March 1861 for use as a pre-flight test for a proposed transatlantic flight planned to take place in June 1861. Lowe had already made a successful test flight in his super-gigantic balloon, the City of New York (renamed Great Western), in June 1860. However, his attempts to take off on a transatlantic attempt in September were thwarted by weather, which damaged the balloon to an extent the attempt would have to be delayed until the next spring. Prof. Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution advised Lowe to take test flight from a point west to the eastern seaboard. This would maintain the interest in his investors. Lowe decided on Cincinnati. Lowe's balloon used the normal easterly winds, below the jetstream. It was his intent to wait for perfect conditions, that is, a wind blowing west through which he would fly and catch the easterly wind home. It was a month before the conditions came about. Lowe was hailed from a dinner being held in his honor to begin inflation. At 4 a.m. on April 19, 1861, Lowe boarded the Enterprise with a container of hot coffee wrapped in a blanket, another of water, and a batch of freshly printed Cincinnati newspapers which would be proof of his flight should he succeed. Lowe ascended through the west wind and into the dark. By morning he was spotted over Kentucky. He had attained altitudes in excess of 20,000 feet according to his instrumentation, and had flown some 900 circuitous miles to a landing in Unionville, South Carolina. There he was taken under house arrest as a Yankee spy, and it was a few days deliberating his fate until which time a local college professor could vouch for Lowe's work as a scientist. Lowe was given safe passage back to Cincinnati to pick up his balloons. It was at this point that he was asked to, and ultimately offered his services to the Union Army.  Washington, D.C. to Bull Run  Lowe was called to Washington, D.C. by the Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase. By June 11 Lowe had an audience with Lincoln and offered a demonstration of his balloon. With the use of a telegraph key and operator, Lowe ascended in the Enterprise 500 feet over the White House and transmitted: :Balloon Enterprise in the Air :To His Excellency, Abraham Lincoln :President of the United States :Dear Sir: :From this point of observation we command an extent of our country nearly fifty miles in diameter. I have the pleasure of sending you this first telegram ever dispatched from an aerial station, and acknowledging indebtedness to your encouragement for the opportunity of demonstrating the availability of the science of aeronautics in the service of the country. :I am, Your Excellency's obedient servant, :T.S.C. Lowe Lowe was held up in Washington for a time while decisions on the use of balloons were being made. At the same time, there were other applicants seeking the position of Chief Aeronaut. Lowe tried to convince the military that special duty balloons would need to be built for military purposes and that even his own Enterprise was not up to the task. So as not to shrug from his purpose at hand, Lowe took the Enterprise out with General McDowell's army to the site of the Battle of First Bull Run. In his first free flight demonstration, Lowe's landing was rebuffed by Union soldiers who could not make out any type of military insignia for Lowe and his balloon — as he had none — and was forced to land behind enemy lines. Fortunately he was rescued before the enemy could find him. In this escapade the Enterprise was badly damaged, but Lowe was finally given orders to build a proper balloon. Eventually the Enterprise was put back into light service with Lowe's father, Clovis, and assistant Capt. John Dickenson (Navy retired) in Washington, D.C. After Lowe was able to build seven proper military balloons, the Enterprise was decommissioned.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, HD 85512 b (3.6 Earth masses) and OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb (5.5 Earth masses), or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses).  Background  The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations of extrasolar planets. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply for few of the extrasolar planets known; because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b. That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14. Most known transiting planets are hot Jupiters. Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation.  Planetary classes  Class I: Ammonia clouds = Planets in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about . The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for JupiterJupiter Fact Sheet and 0.342 for Saturn.Saturn Fact Sheet The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet require a cool star or a distant orbit. The former stars might be too dim for us even to know about them, and the latter orbits might be too unpronounced for notice until several observations of those orbits' \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). Superjovians would have enough mass to improve these observations; but a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter will have more internal heating than said planet, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. = Class II: Water clouds = Planets in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (-23 °C; -10 °F). Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. = Class III: Cloudless = Planets with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds. These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, COROT-9b and HD 205739 b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds. = Class IV: Alkali metals = Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet. HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky. HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. = Class V: Silicate clouds = For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments. Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b. HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13 b.

The Fiji petrel was originally known from one immature specimen found in 1855 on Gau Island, Fiji by naturalist John MacGillivray on board HMS Herald who took the carcass to the British Museum in London. It was rediscovered in 1983, since when there have been a further 21 records, which included the capture and photographing of one adult in April 1984. This species is classified as critically endangered as it is inferred from the number of records that there is only a tiny population of less than 50 confined to a very small breeding area. This bird is described as being long dark with chocolate-coloured feathers, a dark eye and bill and pale blue foot patches. It may be seen in waters around Gau Island but is believed to disperse to pelagic waters far from the island. The rarity and significance of this species is known to local residents of Gau and it is featured on a Fijian bank note, as well as featuring in the logo for now-defunct Air Fiji. It is protected under Fijian law. In 1989, research on the ridge around possible nesting areas was terminated since it was felt that such activities, without complementary conservation action, could encourage cats to follow paths into the area.

Two months before the 1997 general election he defected to the Referendum Party, becoming the only MP it ever had. The party dissolved later that year. Political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh described Gardiner as \\"a staunch right-wing Thatcherite\\".  Early life and career  Born at Bush Bungalow in Waltham Abbey, Essex, Gardiner was the son of Stanley Frederick Gardiner (13 August 1906 - 4 September 1958), a gasworks manager, and Ethel Emma Gardiner nee Gale (31 March 1903 - August 1987), a bookkeeper. Gardiner's parents divorced when he was 10, at the end of the Second World War. As an only child (though he would gain two half-brothers from his father's second marriage), from this point he was raised by his mother as a single parent who worked in a butcher's shop and lived in a cheaply rented home. He was educated at the Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) and gained a first-class honours degree in 1958. Before his period at Oxford University, he did his national service, and was a sergeant tester of entrants, posted to the Pioneer Corps. He joined the Conservative Party in 1950; at Oxford University he organised a petition in support of Anthony Eden's Suez policy. Gardiner became secretary of the University Conservative Association in 1957. During an election for the post of president of the association, he printed scores of forged ballot papers for a postal vote backing his own candidacy. His deception was discovered and he had to withdraw. He worked as a journalist after he left university. He was political correspondent for the Western Daily Press from 1961 to 1964, and then was chief lobby correspondent for Thomson Regional newspapers from 1964 to 1974. Whilst there he was mistrusted by some of his colleagues because of his close affiliation with the Conservatives. From 1978 to 1989, Gardiner had a column in the Sunday Express. He stood unsuccessfully as Conservative candidate for Coventry South at the 1970 general election, in which he distanced himself from the anti-immigration rhetoric of Enoch Powell and built a close relationship with the local Sikh community. Like Powell, in later life Gardiner was well known for his vehemently Eurosceptic views, but earlier he had supported Britain's entry into the European Community (EC). He was a founder member of the Conservative Group for Europe, and had argued in A Europe for the Regions (1971) that the regions would benefit from entry into the EC. Parliamentary career On 22 January 1973, the local Conservative Party in Reigate accepted Gardiner as their prospective parliamentary candidate, and he was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Reigate, a safe seat, on 28 February 1974. He served as MP for the constituency for the next 23 years. Although a right-wing Conservative, Gardiner was a Heath loyalist after the 1972 economic U-turn to combat rising unemployment, which produced the Barber boom by injecting more spending yet cutting taxes. After the party's fall from government at the February 1974 general election he remained loyal, but after another party defeat in the October 1974 election he concluded that Heath had to resign, and sought a replacement within the Conservative Party. Gardiner was always proudest of the role he played in the election of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative Party leader. Along with Thatcher, Norman Tebbit and Airey Neave, he formed what was dubbed by the Tribune newspaper 'The Gang of Four' in her leadership race. In 1975, Gardiner wrote a biography about Thatcher, named From Childhood to Leadership. However, despite his long, enthusiastic and loyal support, Thatcher never once offered Gardiner a ministerial or front bench position during her years as party leader or as Prime Minister. From the 1979 general election, the first of four terms of Conservative government, Gardiner was vociferous in urging the government to go faster on trade union reform and rebuked the government when it climbed down over pit closures after threats of industrial action from the National Union of Mineworkers. In March 1985, he urged the government to abolish wage councils, which took some time to implement, as in some industries, wage councils formed the backbone of trade union negotiations, and it occurred only in September 1993. He shared an office for some time at Westminster with Neil Hamilton. Gardiner became a leading member of the Monday Club. In 1984, he was a member of the Club's National Executive Council and was also Chairman of the Privatisation Policy Committee, which produced, in September 1984, a policy paper entitled Killing the Dinosaur of State Ownership. He was on the editorial board that prepared the Club's October 1985 Conservative Party Conference issue of their newspaper, Right Ahead and contributed an article: 'Why Margaret – Still?' in support of Margaret Thatcher. Gardiner continued writing for the Club, and in the October 1989 edition of Right Ahead, he contributed the leading front-page article entitled 'Murders that should lie on the conscience of MPs', calling for the return of capital punishment. Gardiner was also a strong supporter of the unpopular and short-lived Poll tax (officially known as the Community Charge). When in November 1990, Margaret Thatcher was on the verge of resignation, Gardiner led a last gasp deputation of loyal MPs to Number 10 to try to persuade her to fight on. She listened politely to their pleas, but her mind was already made up and she announced her departure the following day. Gardiner was rewarded with a knighthood in her resignation honours list. He voted for her chosen successor, John Major, in the leadership contest to replace her, and was delighted when Major defeated Michael Heseltine and Douglas Hurd to become Prime Minister and Conservative party leader. However, he later became disillusioned with Major for his apparent lack of Thatcherite beliefs and plotted against him. He was vice-president of the conservative Selsdon Group, named after the key swing voters that the party said it needed to win elections, the Selsdon resident. In 1986, he was elected to the 1922 Committee executive. In January 1991, following the demise of his friend, David Storey, the Club's ousted chairman, Gardiner left the Monday Club. That year, he was knighted. Attempting to preserve the party's Thatcherite philosophy undiluted, Gardiner was instrumental in setting up the Conservative Way Forward group, with the express aim of providing a focal point for supporting those seen as ideologically sympathetic to Thatcherism in the government: including Michael Portillo and John Redwood. Some credit the organisation with success in ensuring a shift to the right in the new prospective parliamentary candidates being selected within the party after 1992. In February 1994, Gardiner was given short shrift by Major after it was disclosed by the press that a delegation of MPs he led intended to tell Major that he must promote key right-wing ministers as a condition of their continued support. In July 1994, Gardiner left the Church of England and became a Roman Catholic in protest against the Anglican church's ordination of women priests. In the July 1995 leadership election contest, Gardiner reluctantly voted for Redwood as party leader; in fact, he would have preferred Portillo. After Redwood was defeated, Gardiner told Major to bring him back to the cabinet, which Major refused to do. Gardiner resigned from the Conservative Party after being deselected by his local party association. He had survived a deselection attempt on 28 June 1996, but an article six months later in the Sunday Express, where he compared Major to a ventriloquist's dummy for the government's pro-European Chancellor Kenneth Clarke proved to be the last straw for his constituency party, and Gardiner was deselected as Conservative candidate for the next general election, by 291 votes to 226 votes, on 30 January 1997. After unsuccessfully challenging the decision in the courts, on 8 March 1997, Gardiner joined the Referendum Party and was its candidate in the 1997 general election. He was, for two weeks, the only person ever to have sat as a Referendum Party MP. On 1 May 1997, Gardiner stood in Reigate as a Referendum Party candidate. He was defeated, obtaining 7% of the vote. He came fourth out of six candidates. This was the end of Gardiner's political career. Later life After William Hague became Conservative party leader in June 1997, Gardiner rejoined the Conservatives. Two years later, in 1999, he published his autobiography covering mainly his years in politics, named A Bastard's Tale, a reference to Major's remark six years earlier to Michael Brunson, but it touched upon his life before becoming an MP. Gardiner revealed that he cried himself to sleep on the night of Thatcher's resignation and described John Major as 'a walking disaster' and a 'Walter Mitty' with no beliefs. In his autobiography later that year, Major claimed that Gardiner was 'so convoluted he could have featured in a book of knots'. Of Gardiner's deselection in 1997, Major wrote that \\"the Conservative Party was able to bear his departure with fortitude\\". Personal life In July 1982, Gardiner underwent a heart by-pass operation. Sir George Gardiner died at St George's Nursing Home, Westminster, on 16 November 2002 of polycystic kidney disease and chronic renal failure and was buried nine days later, in Brompton Cemetery, London. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Gardiner married twice. His first marriage was in Bristol in 1961 to Juliet D Wells with whom he had two sons and a daughter. This marriage broke up just before the 1979 general election. His second marriage was in London on 19 September 1980 to (Daphne) Helen Hackett. There were no children from his second marriage.

They were one of the few U.S.-based bands who styled themselves on England's distinctive shoegaze sound, taking their inspiration from bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Th' Faith Healers, and Bleach. The band was formed by former classmates Greg Ackell (vocals, guitar) and Chris Roof (drums), who recruited Paula Kelley (vocals, guitar), Steve Zimmerman (bass), and Motohiro Yasue (guitar).Strong, Martin C.:\\"The Great Alternative & Indie Discography\\", 1999, Canongate, Overview Much like Boston's Pixies before them, Drop Nineteens were better known in the UK, where, as an unsigned band, they first gained attention from the British music press with two 8-track demos. The band ultimately reached the UK's Indie Album and Indie Singles charts with formal releases after signing a record deal. Signing to Caroline Records (Hut Records in the UK), Drop Nineteens immediately garnered college radio airplay with their 1992 debut album, Delaware. Because of artistic differences, several member changes occurred between the first and second full-length releases. Kelley, Roof and Yasue went on to pursue other interests, and Megan Gilbert (vocals, guitar), Pete Koeplin (drums, now drummer for the band Kahoots) and Justin Crosby (guitar) were added to the lineup in 1993. Shortly thereafter, Drop Nineteens released their second full-length album, National Coma. Its original cover design was a photograph of a reclining nude woman, painted entirely white, wearing a white ski mask, in front of a white background. Most CD copies had a jumbled (censored) version of this photo, while LPs had the original cover. (The Japanese version of the album had two bonus tracks: \\"Tempest\\" and \\"Sea Rock.\\") The band made three music videos, and toured on the success of their first album; they headlined/co-headlined/opened tours in England, Europe, and North America, and recorded BBC radio sessions for John Peel and Mark Goodier. They also played several music festivals including England's Reading Festival and North America's Lollapalooza. Further artistic differences ensued, however, and the band broke up for good in 1995. In the late 1990s, Ackell and Koeplin recorded an album under the band name Fidel,http://www.myspace.com/fideltheband which was never formally released. Kelley went on to front the bands Hot Rod and Boy Wonder, and is currently a solo artist with the Paula Kelley Orchestra.

Camerino, the older town, had a better position to control the huge number of traffic that came through the narrow pass at Muccia on the Flaminian road. The Camerinese were keen to control the routes through to southern Italy. The castle at Grotagna, that came to be called Macereto, was often disputed in the fierce rivalry with Visso, and when Pope Boniface IX placed Macereto under the jurisdiction of Visso in 1404 and then finally, in 1521, when \\"Duke Giovanni Maria Varano organised inspections and an in-depth study on the disagreements between the communities of Appennino, Ussita and Cupi\\" and a decree was issued that divided the contested land and put the hilltop of Macereto under control of Visso. Vissanis celebrated this event with the commission of the sanctuary. =Naming = Macereto as a place was first documented in 1255, when a landholder of the region, Tiboldo di Farolfo of Nocria sold this and nearbly properties to Visso In 1259, the Count Magalotto dei Magolotti sold to Camerino a number of properties, including the Macereto Castle and its people.Venanzangeli, p. 14. A rivalry between the boroughs heightened, because neither of these sales was entirely legal, since much of this desolate and barren land had never been formally recorded; thus the intramilial feud changed into an inter-communal feud. In 1277 Visso burned down the Camerinese Appennine Castle, which was subsequently rebuilt. In 1313, Camerino destroyed the Castle of Macereto with the help of the Duke of Spoleto. This castle was also rebuilt. Pope Boniface IX tried to mediate, assigning the Rocca di Macereto to the Counts Bante and Apollonio, sons of the papal notary Cataldino Boncompagni. By the end of the 14th century, the Boncompagni left the isolated Castle of Macereto and moved to Visso. In 1499 in one of the ensuing battles, the Camerinese killed Cataldino Boncompagni, forcing the family to emigrate and sell off the title to Visso. This left Castle of Macereto under the official control of Visso. They were to be linked again when in 1583 Pope Gregory XIII, from the same Boncompagni family, honoured his familial roots by making Visso a permanent base for the Government. In 1521, the issued decree and truce ended the disputes over the land, with \\"the verdict agreed and sworn upon by Sir Venanzio Cistofori, legal authority of Camerino and by Sir Gianpietro Dominici, legal authority of Visso\\". In 1522, having set up the new borders with Camerino and achieving domination over the area with a final decisive victory over another rival borough of Nursini in the battle of Pian Ferduto, \\"Visso was then able to make use of its freedom and new security to realize the long planned project and build at Macereto, a great and artistic sanctuary.\\"Venanzangeli, p. 30. Origin of the Sanctuary Statue of Our Lady of Macereto The Macereto plateau had been grazing lands for shepherds transiting from Mounts Sibillini to the territories of Visso and Norcia, and the Roman plains, between the end of September and the beginning of May.Grazing routes described by Varrone (in Rerum Rusticarum) and Columella (De re rustica)In the Macereto plain, flocks could come and graze without encroaching on each other. This led to annual summer sheep fairs (fiere), which continues to this day. The altopiano of Macereto was also traversed by a road running from the Marche to the Kingdom of Naples. With the increasing flow of pilgrims, the fiera of Macereto gained importance.Paciaroni pp. 183–184. A small shrine likely already existed at the spot before the miracle, tended by the shepherds. The sanctuary at Macereto supposedly was erected after a miracle. A wooden statue of the Madonna and Child (Madonna di Macereto) by an unknown master was being transported across the mountains as a gift from the Marca di Ancona to the Kingdom of Naples. On 12 August 1356, the animal that hauled the wagon with the statue halted here at Macereto, a spot the Madonna putatively chose.In Il Quattrocento, Raffaele Casciaro of Camerino, described the statue as \\"the most famous work, and therefore the eponymous piece, of a group of anonymous sculptures distributed between the ancient diocese of Camerino and of Valnerina and connected by tightened technique and similar style. The resulting geometric synthesis of this compact group of wood carvings, the iconic system of the image, is transfigured in an embrace of overwhelming sweetness\\", while others described it as an \\"idyll of love, tenderness and sublime devotion\\".Venanzangeli, pp. 76–78. This sweet and sentimental style of carving was popular in The Marche; similar statues exist in Castel Sant'Angelo, Caldarola, Visso, Preci, Camerino and Sarnarno. It is unclear if the sculptor derives from Umbria or Siena. By 1414, miraculous healings had been attributed to the statue; for example, one Angelo di Forsivo had regained sight in the presence of the statue. The chiesetta became filled with ex-voto gifts and many tokens were also given to the church of Santa Maria in Visso. By 1486, the chiesetta was a common stop on the pilgrimage route to Loreto. (The Church did not approve of Loreto as a place of pilgrimage itself until 1507). \\"With a legal testament made on the 29 April 1486, a certain Clemente di Arbe sent in his place a person to complete a devout pilgrimage and he exhorted him, after to have been to Assisi, to continue for Saint Maria di Loreto, taking the route of the Valnerina, with pause at Macereto.\\"Grimaldi p. 100. The shrine became the recipient of donations and inheritances, and was the focus of local devotion. In 1480 the people of Ussita were exhorted to visit the church \\"at least once a month between the months of April and September. Failure to visit the church would incur a charge of 10 soldi. Also, everyone from the castle owner to the labourer has to sing during the mass and take part in prayers.\\"Venanzangeli, p. 28. Important visitors began to arrive on pilgrimages as recorded on the temple stone, \\"prodigiorum pompa culture populum illustres principes frequenter viros traxit ad se\\" and on 12 August 1464 it was recorded that \\"between the pilgrims there were cardinals Marco Rovere and Teodoro Leli\\", also, in 1503 \\"when Pope Alessandro VI died, the tyrannical Duke Valentino took over the area near Visso. The bishops from Umbria, in return, pilgrim to Macereto and the bishops and priest from Camerino were asking our powerful Queen for a new Pope and peace for the Church.\\" On 12 August 1520, \\"within the crowd and the famous pilgrims was Marca Niccolo Bonafede, bishop of Chiusi\\".Venanzangeli, p. 29. Some state Niccolo's first name was not Marca, but instead he was likely a governatore of Marca. In 1510, the fame of the Madonna of Macereto motivated the Duke of Camerino, Giovanni Maria Varano and his party, to move the statue from Macereto to Camerino. The Vissani however intercepted the party at the Varenesi crossing. In the ensuing battle, the statue was irreparably damaged. The Bishop Bonafede of Chiusi intervened, and by 1517 he helped the presbytery of Visso to apply to have the Macereto chapel under the local government Venanzangeli, p. 30. and persuaded Varano to define a borders between Camerino and Visso. Once the legal rights to the land were secure, the Vissani swiftly planned for a sanctuary to encompass the chiesetta. The Capitolo della Collegiata of Visso, who previously administered the chiesetta, was entrusted to raise funds from three sources: income earned from the land that was already owned by the sanctuary, money from the four collection boxes placed in the church made up the second part and the third section comprised donations and gifts that were streaming in from outside the church itself. As soon as it was known that there was to be a marvellous sanctuary built, the local population began donating great sums of money to the project. Naturally most of the money came from wealthy patrons. Connected with The Church, these donations assuaged the guilt perhaps felt by the very rich. In this case, the donations were carried along on the \\"fiume delle lane\\" (Don Sante Deuteri - interview) that had brought huge wealth to the landlords of the region. This ambitious project was carried out by sizable donations of Visso, left after pilgrimages and endowments by the devout, like Cristoforo Pierangel from Ussita, who died in 1524 \\"near the sanctuary where he had gone in ill health\\".Venanzangeli, page 31. By the 1520s there were so many donations coming in that it was said, \\"there were no wills done that would not leave something towards the construction of that church\\".Pirri, p. 39. The Collegiata administered the funds until 1562 when irregularities were noted, for example, \\"apparently in good will, 47 scudi coming from Macereto were spent to buy a new floor in Santa Maria of Visso.\\"Venanzangeli. The Priori of Visso were then given the administration responsibilities and they in turn would report to the Collegiata. On 26 September 1586 Pope Sixtus V issued a document that made the situation official through a \\"transaction that took place on 12 December 1583 between Church and Community leaders of Visso… Amongst other things, the way that the expenses towards the maintenance of the church people in service in Macereto were dealt with, their rights and duties, the responsibilities of the Priori for all expenses – which they could not authorize without orders and planning from the architects, failure to do so would have resulted in them being held responsible with their own belongings – all came under strict regulations.\\"Venanzangeli, p. 32. The Architects of the Sanctuary In 1527 the Collegiata and the Commune of Visso entrusted Master Gian Battista da Bissone with the design of the Sanctuary. He had designed and built Palazzo Ottoni (1452) and Palazzo Piersanti in nearby Matelica. Also involved was Master Filippo Salvi from Melide, Switzerland who had worked on the Santa Maria della Consolazione (Todi) at Todi. Some theorize the original circular design was by Donato Bramante. But Bramante, Salvi and Gian Battista da Lugano all fled Lombardy at about the same time. The facts are that when Bramante went to Milan in 1480, where he was employed on creating the dome for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. \\"By 1490, centralized structures not unlike those of Bramante's St. Peter's or Santa Maria della Consolazione at Todi had appeared amongst Leonardo's sketches.\\"Bruschi p. 44 The pragmatics of building a symmetrical church are challenged by the cost. Presuming that one solved the placement of the main altar, another unanswered question is where to put the campanile. Bramante's Tempietto did not pose this dilemma since it did not require one; for St Peter's Basilica, cost was not an issue, so a campanile at each 'corner' was planned (which was Leonardo's vision, see fig). The clearest illustration of an attempt to deal with the campanile question in a church outside Rome is the sanctuary of Santa Maria della Consolazione at Todi which in fact is not even clearly attributed to Bramante, although Bruschi does list references to Bramante in connection with it. \\"Typically understood as a simplification of his plan for St Peter's, there is evidence for Bramante's participation in its design at some level. The design, after all, has much in common with the Leonardesque themes that Bramante brought with him from Milan. Above all, the Consolazione's pristine combination of cube, drum, dome and apses shows its origins in the sketches by Leonardo that were central to his development as an artist (fig)…Though in most respects the ideas of Bramante are undeniably present, the flaccid orders on the exterior of this otherwise impressive church suggests that he may not have participated directly in its execution\\".Bruschi pp. 44–45 The connection between the sanctuary of Santa Maria della Consolazione and that at Macereto is evident in architectural details and motifs. As at Todi, the Macereto sanctuary is centrally planned, built on a Greek cross system within an octagonal drum. Todi was also built to house a relic that would have been placed in a small chapel beneath the central dome as at Macereto. The architect who had worked on both buildings was Master Filippo Salvi da Meli who worked with Gian Battista da Lugano and it was Gian Battista who remained in charge of the construction until his untimely death in 1539 when he fell from a scaffold whilst completing the arches of the temple. Bramante's influence is everywhere and most people writing about the sanctuary mention him at some point, even if only to say that the building is Bramantesque. In his The temple of the Madonna of Macereto. Malpeli claims \\"the temple of Macereto was heavily influenced by Bramante, especially in the decorative vibrations which were very particular. This is why we were allowed to say that the monument is of a Bramantesque style. The paternity of the temple has to be given to the architect Battista Lugano, especially for the general idea and the more constructive part, which was getting away from the minimalism that is found in Bramante's work.\\"Malpeli p. 37 The imposing exterior walls of the sanctuary are almost entirely undecorated. There are three great, classically inspired doors with pedimented arches decorated with columns with Doric capitols. Unadorned white stone walls rise to the cornice that is also simply decorated with Corinthian columns. The outside of the building remains unfinished as work had to be stopped in 1566 when the builders discovered that the ground would not support the external dome or a campanile. It is the interior however, that bears such a striking resemblance to the interiors of both Santa Maria della Consolazione and Santa Maria at Loreto. All three buildings have a great dome above sacred image. In the case of the Santa Maria della Consolazione, the image has ended up in one of the semicircular apses, but it is this church that has the architectonic connections with the sanctuary of Macereto. Four main pillars that are connected by great arches, which are decorated identically, support the central dome. The arches are decorated with coffers with rosettes. Both churches have the same decorations and it is this style that links the Todi and Macereto sanctuaries, pointed out by most commentators. It would have been Master Filippo Salvi, working on both projects, who would have used this technique. These two great Marian sanctuaries of the cinquecento in central Italy correspond with each other because of the actual connection provided by Salvi but they were also representative of the spirit of the age. And even if it was not actually Donato Bramante who had submitted the original drawings for the buildings, it is undeniable that his presence is in both structures. At the sanctuary in Loreto, the dome and shrine are at the eastern end of a conventional church built in the oblong model of the basilica. But once one comes to the focus of the church, the tiny capella that houses the Santa Casa, the relationship between this and the sanctuary at Macereto is clear. The 'original' home of the Virgin Mary was transported first from Galilee to Dalmatia and then, in 1294 across to the bandit-infested laurel grove above Porto Recanati, hence the name 'Loreto'. It would not be until about two hundred years later, in 1507 that the Church approved of Loreto as a place of pilgrimage and the work began, which was around the same time as the construction of the sanctuaries of both Todi and Macereto. Whilst it is apparent that more money came to Loreto and so the Santa Casa is visibly more splendid, the decoration of the inner chapels are very similar and it is generally agreed that the chiesetta at Macereto echoes that of Loreto. A simple white stone and marble rectangular shell surrounds the original building that contains the image. It was Bramante who had handed in the original designs for the shrine at Loreto but had had very little to do with it after that, the job having been taken on by the great medal designer Gian Cristoforo Romano, Andrea Sansovino and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. It is a good example of High Renaissance Architecture, combining the elegance and simplicity of the classical lines and motifs with rich encrustations of statues and other decoration. The basic design of the Santa Casa resonates in the chiesetta at Macereto. The cornice is decorated with a simple Greek key design, below which hang swags. The columns, in bas-relief at Macereto are lighter and more minimal than the pomp and splendour of those at Loreto. Where the statues of the prophets seated around the lower level of the shrine at Loreto (highly reminiscent of Michelangelo's prophets in the Medici tomb in Florence) are, at Macereto there are empty niches. Whether there were plans to install any statues is not known. The outer walls of the Santa Casa are covered with relief work, statues and other decoration, there is very little empty space, as if the three artists commissioned to complete the building could not resist making yet another addition. As a result it comes across as being rather overloaded in contrast to the delicate simplicity of Macereto's chiesetta. If we work on the assumption that the sanctuary at Macereto was one of the officially recognised stop-overs on one of the major pilgrimage routes to Loreto it is tempting to view the construction of the chiesetta as being something that would not only connect the two sanctuaries by visible association but also serve to keep the pilgrims minded of their eventual destination. The architectural motifs and style of the two - churches-within- churches - are rare and bear such a striking resemblance to one another that with the suggestion that Donato Bramante may have had a hand in the design of both. At some stage, it would hint that there is more to connect them than the fact that they are both Marian shrines. Added to this, both Todi and Macereto sanctuaries are centrally planned 'temples'of the High Renaissance, a time when The Church was eager to convince a population shaken by the steady drip of the Reformation that there was only one true Church. The connection between the sanctuaries at Macereto and Todi is also clear in the documents and also the treatment of other architectural details, I have used this to indicate the link between the architects, with Filippo Salvi as the 'go-between' for Bramante. The importance of this sanctuary and perhaps the reason why it was valued so highly was that it contained the holy statue, a physical representation of a miracle that in turn stood for the victory of one powerful and rich merchant town over its more ancient and venerable neighbour.

After leaving uniformed military service as a colonel, he held high-level posts in military intelligence as a civilian. He led intelligence analysis of the Middle East and South Asia for the Defense Department and world-wide HUMINT activities in a high-level equivalent to the rank of a lieutenant general. Background Lang graduated from the Virginia Military Institute with a BA in English and from the University of Utah with an MA in Middle East Studies. He is a member of Phi Kappa Phi. Lang is a member of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a Roman Catholic chivalric order, in which he holds the rank of Knight Commander. Personal life He is married to the former Marguerite Lessard. They reside in Alexandria, Virginia. His uncle is John H. Lang, who served in both World Wars and during the interwar period, with Canadian and U.S. military forces. He received military honors for his actions and bravery from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan. Military service While serving in the US Army, Lang graduated from the U.S. Army War College, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and the Armed Forces Staff College. He is a decorated veteran of several of the United States' overseas conflicts. During the Vietnam War, he served in the Special Forces and Military Intelligence.democrats.senate.gov transcript He was trained and educated as a specialist in the Middle East and served in that region for many years. He was the first professor of Arabic at the United States Military Academy, where he was twice selected as best classroom teacher of the year.democrats.senate.gov transcript At the Defense Intelligence Agency, he was the defense intelligence officer (DIO) for the Middle East, South Asia and counter-terrorism, and later, the first director of the Defense Humint Service. At the DIA, he was a member of the Defense Senior Executive Service. He participated in the drafting of National Intelligence Estimates. From 1992 to 1994, all the U.S. military attachés worldwide reported to him. He was also the head of intelligence analysis for the Middle East for seven or eight years at that institution. He was the head of all the Middle East and South Asia analysis in DIA for counter-terrorism for seven years. For his service in the DIA, Lang received the Presidential Rank Award of Distinguished Executive. Senate Hearing Transcript Post-retirement activities After leaving government service, he joined Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, but left that group over policy differences. For a period prior to and during the Iraq War, he registered under the U.S. Department of Justice's Foreign Agents Registration Act, for his work on behalf of a Lebanese politician and industrialist. He promoted the peace process, vocational training for the building trades, English and French-language instruction, and extending microcredit. He registered on advice of counsel and has since deregistered. Continuing his work on the peace process, he participated in work of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation. As an example: Imagining the Next War. The foundation sponsors individuals for \\"scholarly research on violence, aggression, and dominance.\\" In 2006, Lang was appointed to the foundation's board of directors. Lang edits a personal blog Sic Semper Tyrannis on the subjects of intelligence gathering and analysis, military affairs, and war and peace.  Selected writings  Since his retirement from the US Army, Lang has published many articles on intelligence, special operations and the Islamic World. *\\"Drinking the Koolaid\\", Middle East Policy Journal, August 2004. In 2004, he wrote that members of the Bush Administration manipulated intelligence analysis to strengthen the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Lang has written and discussed the 2006 Lebanon War, in which he described the Hezbollah defense as a defensive belt which he called the \\"Tabouleh Line\\". In an interview with Helena Cobban, he said: > A basic lesson of history is that one must win on the battlefield to dictate > the peace. A proof of winning on the battlefield has always been possession > of that battlefield when the shooting stops. Those who remain on the field > are just about always believed to have been victorious. Those who leave the > field are believed to be the defeated.'Just World News' with Helena Cobban: > Lebanese war; post-war; role of UNIFIL =Iraq and the Middle East= In 2006, Lang said that he thought an American attack on Iran would have deadly repercussions on U.S. occupation troops in Iraq. He noted that \\"troops all over central and northern Iraq are supplied with fuel, food, and ammunition by truck convoy from a supply base hundreds of miles away in Kuwait. All but a small amount of our soldiers' supplies come into the country over roads that pass through the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq.\\" Iraqi Shiia could easily interdict these supplies, not easily replaced by air, once hostilities start.\\"The vulnerable line of supply to US troops in Iraq\\", Christian Science Monitor, 21 July 2006 =Conflict with Iran= In an interview in 2007, he stated that \\"the U.S. has no plans to bomb Iran,\\" to mean that intensive planning is at an advanced stage but no final decision has been made to push the button. He said the forces are largely in place. The bombing could be carried out by naval air from the aircraft carriers in place, missiles from the screening ships of the carrier groups, and air force assets. He said there is dissent in the U.S. administration at high levels whether to bomb Iran, and it is possible for high level resignations to occur even in the uniformed services. He said the concentration of forces has a dual purpose, to prod Iran toward serious negotiations and to be there as a resort if negotiations fail.\\"Interview, W. Patrick Lang\\", CNN, =Personal blog= In 2005 he started his blog, Sic Semper Tyrannis (A Committee of Correspondence).http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/ The main foci of the blog are current affairs and politics, with special emphasis on foreign policy, the military, intelligence and the ME. More recently he published two articles of his memoirs in military intelligence.http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2015/01/yemen- arizona- in-1870-reborn.htmlhttp://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2015/05/ap- bu-nho-a-remembrance-on-memorial-day.html =Historical fiction= Based on his experience in the military and military intelligence and a lifelong interest in the American Civil War, Patrick Lang wrote three novels set in the American Civil War. The trilogy is called: \\"Strike The Tent: A Tale Of The Confederate Secret Services\\". His main character is Confederate agent Claude Devereux around whom the historical events unfold. The first volume, The Butchers Cleaver, was published in 2007. In this book Claude Devereux, who like his whole family in Alexandria does neither support slavery nor secession, is forced by events into his role as Confederate agent. The second volume, Death Piled Hard, was published in 2009. Devereux's brother Patrick is killed at Gettysburg. But there is not much time to mourn for Claude Devereux, who is slowly finding his way into command circles behind enemy lines. The third volume, Down the Skies', was published in 2012. Confederate spy Devereux, by now Brigadier General of the Volunteer Union Forces, not only gained the confidence of president Lincoln but is also getting deeper and deeper insights into the whole administration. But he is suspected of disloyalty, and the Union's Counter-intelligence is on high alert.

It was named after Junio Valerio Borghese, an Italian World War II commander of the Xª MAS unit, convicted of fighting alongside Nazi Germany but not of war crimes, but still a hero in the eyes of many post-War Italian fascists. The coup attempt became publicly known when the left-wing journal Paese Sera ran the headline on the evening of 18 March 1971: Subversive plan against the Republic: far-right plot discovered. The secret operation was code-named Operation Tora Tora after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Willan, Puppetmasters p. 91 The plan of the coup in its final phase envisaged the involvement of US and NATO warships which were on alert in the Mediterranean Sea. However, only a few marginalized sectors of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were in favour of the coup, while the main response was not to allow major changes in the geo- political balance in the Mediterranean. The alleged coup The botched right-wing coup took place after the Hot Autumn of left-wing protests in Italy and the Piazza Fontana bombing in December 1969. The failed coup involved hundreds of neo-fascist militants from Stefano Delle Chiaie's National Vanguard, helped by 187 members of the Corpo Forestale dello Stato, who were to seize the headquarters of the Italian public television broadcaster RAI.https://fondazionenenni.blog/2016/12/08/quarantasei-anni-fa-il-colpo-di- stato-negato/ The plan included the kidnapping of the Italian President Giuseppe Saragat; the murder of the head of the police Angelo Vicari; and the occupation of RAI, the Quirinale, the Ministry of the Interior (from which Vanguard militants would seize weapons), and the Ministry of Defense. Milan- based army dissidents in the Battalion of Lt. Colonel Amos Spiazzi also planned to occupy Sesto San Giovanni, at that time a workers' town and a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party. Apparently some militants briefly entered the Ministry of the Interior, but Borghese suspended the coup a few hours before its final phase. A submachine gun (a Beretta Model 38) not returned by one of the militants was later viewed as a key piece of evidence in the sedition trial.Willan, Puppetmasters p. 91-92 According to Borghese, the neo-fascists were actually gathering for a protest demonstration against the upcoming visit of President Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, which was later postponed. This protest was supposedly called off because of heavy rain.Prince's Lawyers Deny Charge, The New York Times, 22 March 1971 Spiazzi stated that the coup was suspended because the Christian Democratic (DC) government knew of the coup plan and was ready to suppress the plotters and to declare martial law. This suppression was known in its preparatory stages as \\"Exigency Operation Triangle\\", which would be executed in accordance with the Piano Solo plan and comprised the deployment of thousands of government troops, as well as military and civil police to seize control of political parties and publishers, undertake mass arrests and deportations, and effectively preempt any perceived threats to the civil power. Thus Borghese, lacking the support of Spiazzi and his men, aborted the coup at the last minute as the plotters moved into position. Dianese & Bettin, La strage, pp. 165–69 Participants at the semi-clandestine rallies seem to have believed that they would take part in the arrest of politicians and the occupation of key installations by sympathetic army units. When Borghese called off the coup late that night, the presumed plotters, reportedly unarmed, improvised a late spaghetti dinner before returning home.Italian Police Track Leftist Terrorists, The New York Times, 29 March 1971 Several members of the National Front were arrested and a warrant was served for Borghese. Borghese himself fled to Spain and died there in August 1974.Prince Junio Borghese, 68, Dies; Italian War Hero and Neofascist, The New York Times, 28 August 1974 Inquiry On 18 March 1971, the leftist journal Paese Sera was published with the headline: Subversive plan against the Republic: far-right plot discovered. The first arrests concerning the coup attempt were made on the same day. The first people arrested on 18 and 19 March were Mario Rose, a retired army major and National Front secretary; Remo Orlandini, also a former army major, a real-estate proprietor and close associate of Borghese; and Sandro Saccucci, a young paratrooper. An arrest warrant for Borghese was also served, but he could not be found. Later arrestees included businessman Giovanni De Rosa and a retired Air Force colonel, Giuseppe Lo Vecchio. The investigation into the coup attempt was resurrected after Giulio Andreotti became defense minister again. Andreotti handed over a report by the secret service to the Rome public prosecutor in July 1974, revealing a detailed knowledge of the inner workings of the conspiracy and links to members of the secret service. Shortly thereafter, General Vito Miceli, a former head of SID, was brought for questioning before the investigating judge. Miceli's interrogation led to his arrest two days later. Miceli was then sacked, and the Italian intelligence agencies were reorganized by a 1977 law. Trials Junio Valerio Borghese in 1970. Three trials were started for conspiracy against the Italian state. In 1978, Miceli was acquitted of trying to cover up a coup attempt. Saccucci, Orlandini, Rosa, and others were convicted of political conspiracy, which also included Chiaie, whose specific role is unclear. According to a 1987 UPI news cable, he had already fled Italy to Spain on 25 July 1970. However, according to other sources, Chiaie led the commando team which occupied the premises of the Interior Ministry.René Monzat, Enquêtes sur la droite extrême, Le Monde-éditions, 1992, p.84 At the appeal trial in November 1984, all 46 defendants were acquitted because the \\"fact did not happen\\" (il fatto non sussiste) and only existed in \\"a private meeting between four or five sixty-years-olds\\". Il golpe Borghese. Storia di un'inchiesta , La storia siamo noi, Rai Educational (accessed 24 February 2011) E la Cia disse: sì al golpe Borghese ma soltanto con Andreotti premier, La Repubblica, 5 December 2005 The Supreme Court confirmed the appeal judgment in March 1986. Il golpe Borghese: La vicenda giudiziaria , Misteri d'Italia website The final trial connected with the Golpe Borghese began in 1991, after it was discovered that evidence involving prominent persons (Licio Gelli and admiral Giovanni Torrisi) had been destroyed by the secret service before the first trial. Andreotti, minister of defence at the time the evidence was destroyed, declared in 1997 that names had been deleted so that the charges would be easier to understand. This last trial ended without convictions because the period of prescription for destruction of evidence had passed. According to the journalist René Monzat, investigations lasted seven years, during which it was alleged that the Golpe Borghese had benefited from military accomplices, as well as from political support not only from the National Front and from MSI deputy Sandro Saccucci, but also from other political personalities belonging to the DC and to the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI). According to Monzat, investigations also discovered that the military attaché at the US embassy was closely connected to the coup organizers and that one of the main accused declared to the magistrate that US President Richard Nixon had followed the preparations for the coup, of which he was personally informed by two CIA officers. These facts were confirmed through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica in December 2004. However, only a few marginalized sectors of the CIA were in favour of the coup, while the main response was not to allow major changes in the geopolitical balance in the Mediterranean. Involvement of the Mafia According to several state witnesses (pentiti) such as Tommaso Buscetta, Borghese asked the Sicilian Mafia to support the coup. In 1970, when the Sicilian Mafia Commission was reconstituted, one of the first issues that had to be discussed was an offer by Borghese, who asked for support in return for pardons of convicted mafiosi like Vincenzo Rimi and Luciano Leggio. The mafiosi Giuseppe Calderone and Giuseppe Di Cristina visited Borghese in Rome. However, other mafiosi such as Gaetano Badalamenti opposed the plan, and the Mafia decided not to participate.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 151-53 According to Leggio, testifying at the Maxi Trial against the Mafia in the mid-1980s, Buscetta and Salvatore \\"Ciaschiteddu\\" Greco were in favour of helping Borghese. The plan was for the Mafia to carry out a series of terrorist bombings and assassinations to provide the justification for a right-wing coup. Although Leggio's version differed from Buscetta's, the testimony confirmed that Borghese had requested assistance by the Mafia.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 186 According to the pentito Francesco Di Carlo, the journalist Mauro De Mauro was killed in September 1970 because he had learned that Borghese – one of De Mauro's childhood friends – was planning the coup. \\"De Mauro venne ucciso perché sapeva del golpe\\", La Repubblica, 26 January 2001 De Mauro ucciso per uno scoop: scoprì il patto tra boss e golpisti, La Repubblica, 18 June 2005Revealed: how story of Mafia plot to launch coup cost reporter his life, The Independent on Sunday, 19 June 2005 Significance The failed coup has gone down in history as \\"a comic-opera coup staged by naive incompetents, which posed no real threat to the state\\" and newspapers wrote about it as \\"the coup that never was\\".Willan, Puppetmasters, p. 90 However, the secret service report revealed serious connections of the conspiracy with the Nixon administration and with NATO units based in Malta.Willan, Puppetmasters, p. 93 In popular culture A comic film directed by Mario Monicelli and starring popular Italian actor Ugo Tognazzi was released in 1973 and was in the selection of Italian films for the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. It is called Vogliamo i colonelli (We Want the Colonels, in reference to the contemporary US-backed Greek fascist military dictatorship). In this film, Tognazzi portrays a boisterous and clumsy far right MP called Tritoni trying to stage a coup against the government. Though the botched attempt sinks in ridicule and chaos, and Tritoni has to go in exile, right wing political measures are nevertheless enforced, such as forbidding labor strikes and political gatherings. The character's name Tritoni (Triton) is a direct reference to Borghese and his military past as the leader of an assault frogmen unit. The film is peppered with joke references to the fascist period, the post-war neo-fascist Italian Social Movement and the Decima MAS frogmen unit.

Norakuro strongly influenced Machiko Hasegawa, the author of Sazae-san, who apprenticed with its author Suihō Tagawa, as well as Fullmetal Alchemist author Hiromu Arakawa. There is an excerpt that appears in the sixth Kramer's Ergot comics anthology which is the only example of Tagawa's work published in English. History In the original story, the central character Norakuro was a soldier serving in an army of dogs called the . The strip's publication began in Kodansha's Shōnen Kurabu in 1931, and was based on the Imperial Japanese Army of the time; the manga artist, Suihō Tagawa, had served in the Imperial Army from 1919 to 1922. Norakuro was gradually promoted from private to captain in the stories, which began as humorous episodes, but eventually developed into propaganda tales of military exploits against the \\"pigs army\\" on the \\"continent\\" - a thinly-veiled reference to the Second Sino-Japanese War. Serialization of Norakuro stopped in 1941 for wartime austerity reason. After the war, due to the popularity of the strip, the character returned in various guises, including a sumo wrestler and a botanist. Pre-war animated films based on the military Norakuro, and two post-war animated series of Norakuro, in 1970 and 1987, have also been produced. In the 1970 series, the voice of Norakuro was played by Nobuyo Ōyama, also known as the voice of Doraemon. During the 1980s and early 1990s Norakuro was the mascot of the Physical Training School (Tai-Iku Gakko) of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

With his accurate, heavily detailed images of insects he was recognised as an important figure in modern entomology. Life Descendant of a \\"noble family of Austria\\", Rösel was born August Johannes Rösel. This was modified in 1753, undoubtedly in the honour of his uncle, the animal painter Wilhelm Rösel von Rosenhof. Rösel’s father died when he was very young and it was his uncle who gave him an artistic education after his godmother, the princess Augusta Dorothea von Arnstadt-Schwarzburg, had detected his talent. He continued studies of art at the Academy of Nuremberg (1724–1726) where he became a very gifted painter of portraits and miniatures, which enabled him to join the Danish court of Copenhagen in 1726. There he remained two years before returning to Germany, once more to Nuremberg. Recovering from a disease, he discovered the work of Anna Maria Sibylla Merian, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium (1647–1717) in which she described the insects and other animals which she observed in Surinam. Rösel conceived the idea to write and illustrate a similar book on the German fauna. In 1737, he married Elisabeth Maria, the daughter of the surgeon, physiologist and poet Michael Bertram Rosa. In 1741 they had a daughter Katharina Barbara Rösel von Rosenhof, who would also become an artist. His artistic talent gave him a very good reputation so that he lived comfortably while painting and he could use his spare time to observe insects, amphibians and reptiles in nature. He collected eggs and larvae in order to raise them at home and to study their development and their metamorphoses. His detailed observations, more useful by being accompanied by very beautiful illustrations, were published in two large books. The first, Insecten- Belustigung, appeared in 1740 and was devoted to the insects and other invertebrates like the sea anemones. His classification of the insects followed a natural system and he is regarded as one of the fathers of German entomology.A Dutch translation appeared between 1764-1768. The book influenced Christian Sepp. The fourth part is practically a monograph of the spider Araneus diadematus. The description of the animal is illustrated by six plates which show the differences in variation of the colouring of the species. They show also internal dissections. Rosenhof was interested in the production of silk but he confused the anus with the opening of silk-producing glands. He published, between 1753 and 1758, Historia naturalis Ranarum nostratium devoted to frogs. The quality of the work, in particular of its illustrations, make it one of the most beautiful devoted to these animals. He presented the life cycle of all the species of Germany, and their anatomy and their osteology. The second part of the work, appeared in 1758. It is prefaced by Albrecht von Haller (1708–1777). He then started a similar work on the lizards and the salamanders but a cerebral attack paralysed him and he died a little later on March 27, 1759. Many descriptions of species made by Carl von Linné are based on the descriptions given by Rösel. Roesel's bush-cricket Metrioptera roeseli was so named in his honour.

Though officially regarded as the daughter of King Christian VII, it is widely accepted that her biological father was Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king's royal physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of her birth.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon She was referred to sometimes as \\"la petite Struensee\\"; this did not, however, have any effect on her position.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon Early life Portrait of Princess Louise Auguste as a child. Pastel by H.P. Sturz, 1771. In the collection of Rosenborg Castle, Denmark. She was born at Hirschholm Palace in present-day Hørsholm municipality, Denmark. After the arrest of Struensee and Queen Caroline Matilda on 17 January 1772, and the subsequent execution of Struensee and the banishment and imprisonment of her mother, she was raised at the Danish court residing at Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen along with her four-year-old brother, Crown Prince Frederick, under the supervision of Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Louise Augusta and her brother had a very close relationship their entire life, and it was on his request that she agreed to marry, despite the fact that she had no enthusiasm for the match. She was her brother's closest friend, and he developed a strong resentment toward Queen Juliana Maria when she tried to separate them. Marriage Jens Juel. In February 1779 the nation's foremost statesman, Chief Minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff, hatched an ingenious plan for the young princess. Since a son of hers could ascend the throne some day, it would be advantageous to arrange a marriage early, and to marry the \\"half-royal\\" back into the family, to the Hereditary Prince of Augustenborg.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon This plan not only had the positive effect of more closely connecting the Danish royal house's two lines, the ruling House of Oldenborg and the offshoot House of Augustenborg, thus discouraging the threat of a breakup of the kingdom, but also the prevention of her marriage into the Swedish royal house. Her future spouse was a prince with an exceptionally high concentration of recent Danish ancestors. He was closely related to all important families of the then high nobility of Denmark. The binding agreements were made a year later, and in spring 1785 the 20-year-old Duke Frederick Christian II came to Copenhagen. The engagement was announced then, and a year later, on 27 May 1786 the 14-year-old Louise Augusta was married at Christiansborg Palace.  Life at the Danish court  Juel The couple lived at the Danish court in Copenhagen for many years until the Christiansborg Palace fire of 1794 and the death of the elder Duke of Augustenborg (Frederik Christian I, 1721–1794), when her husband inherited the estate and the Duchy. The princess was often the center of court activities, and was proclaimed the “Venus of Denmark”; she was the real female center of the Danish royal court even after her brother's marriage in 1790. After 1794 they lived during the summer on the island of Als and at Gråsten. They lived in Denmark in the winters and in Augustenburg during the summers, where she held a lively court, where artists, such as the poet Jens Baggesen, were among her admirers. The spouses were dissimilar: while Louise Augusta was extrovert, lively, beautiful and pleasure-loving, her spouse was unattractive, serious, interested in philosophy and politics. She was said to have many lovers, among them most notably the doctor Carl Ferdinand Suadacini, who treated her for infertility and was believed to have fathered her children, though this cannot be proven.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon Louise Augusta felt sympathy for the French revolution and had therefore anti-British views from 1789 onward.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon  Later life  Over the years conflict developed between her husband and her brother, especially over the relationship of the double-duchies of Schleswig- Holstein and his small appanage around Sonderborg on one hand and the Danish monarchy on the other. She remained loyal to the Danish Royal House or rather, to her brother, throughout the differences, and acted as his agent with her spouse. In 1810 she worked actively to stop the Duke's attempts to be chosen as successor to the Swedish throne, which were linked with the duke's younger brother Charles August of Augustenburg becoming chosen by Swedes and then dying, after which Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Marshal of France and Prince of Ponte Corvo, was elected. Their relationship eventually fell apart, and Frederik Christian tried to legally limit her influence over their children's future. He died on 14 June 1814, and Louise Augusta took control of the Augustenborg estates and the children's upbringing. The estate was turned over to the eldest son, Christian August, on his return from an extended foreign tour in 1820. From then on she resided in the Augustenborg Castle, where she established an eccentric court. In 1832 in order to give her youngest son, Frederik Emil August, better income possibilities she purchased the estate Nør and Grønwald in Dänischwold near Ekernførde Fjord in South Schleswig. She had a close and warm relationship with her daughter and her son-in-law, but her relationship to her sons was tense. She died at Augustenborg in 1843, when her brother's reign in Denmark had already ended and Christian VIII, her son-in- law, ascended - she thus died as the mother of the then Queen of Denmark.  Louise Augusta in culture and legacy  Two portraits of her were painted by Danish artist Jens Juel. The first from 1784 is in Royal Collection, London, and the second from 1787 is in the Frederiksborg Palace Museum. Another portrait of her by Anton Graff is in Sønderborg Castle. Danish author Maria Helleberg has written a best-selling historical novel based on the life of Louise Augusta called \\"Kærlighedsbarn\\" (\\"Love Child\\"), which inspired a special biographical exhibition on the life of the princess at Rosenborg Castle.

Thomas Cole Richens and Patricia S. Wayne. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2006 at 645 Titus Avenue. Since the initial relocation in 1972, the House of Guitars has purchased three additional adjacent buildings, interconnecting these buildings for means of expansion. This had led to what some consider a bizarre 'maze' like layout, where separate store rooms containing music related equipment are connected via long hallways, sharp turns, un-level floors, et cetera. > ...

Unique store layout The interior of HoG. The store is divided into two distinct sections: the front part, facing Titus Avenue, houses all varieties of electric guitars, acoustic guitars and bass guitars as well as drums, keyboards and amplifiers. The rear section, accessible from a back door near Grange Pl. or from the front through a short maze of corridors, houses the music collection. At first sight, the music store appears as more of a rummage sale, with nearly everything arranged in a state of disarray, however, simply asking an employee for help is an option, as most employees know where everything is. In addition to music on CD, cassette and vinyl records, the store also sells videos, T-shirts, magazines, posters, music books and thousands of other rock memorabilia items. The angled ceilings are covered with signed photographs, posters, and drum pads, while the walls are covered in sharpie signatures from musicians who have visited in the past. Cultural impact House of Guitars (sometimes referred to its abbreviation, the 'HoG') has appeared in several magazines. This includes an August 1997 issue of People magazine, which features a page-long article on Armand Schaubroeck and The House of Guitars. In this article, Schaubroeck is quoted as saying, \\"If you want a hard-to-find guitar, we can hand it to you in six or seven different colors.\\"No byline (1997-08-11) \\"Strum Major\\" from People magazine One of the characters in the 1994 film PCU wore a House of Guitars T-shirt throughout the film. The Wall Street Journal also published an article about the store on June 12, 1997. HoG also appeared in Details magazine as 'Top Guitar shop' in February, 2002. In 2008, it was named in the Top 200 Largest Music Product Retailers. Several popular musical acts/bands have at one time or another shopped at the House of Guitars, including Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, Mathew Sweet, Aerosmith, Jon Bon Jovi, The Ramones and Mötley Crüe. Many national acts stop in when they have gigs in the Rochester area and the store often holds events where fans can meet musicians for autograph signings and photo ops. The House of Guitars has employed a non-traditional approach to commercial sales. One example of this is their bizarre surrealist early television commercial ads of the 1960s–1980s, shot on 16mm film which can still be viewed on local area television from time to time.

A deeply unpopular figure, he has the ignominious distinction of being the first recorded person to have been lynched à la lanterne. Offices Born in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, Foullon served as Intendant- General of the Armies during the Seven Years' War, and as Intendant of the Army and Navy under Marshal de Belle-Isle. In 1771 he was appointed Intendant of Finances. In 1789, when Jacques Necker was dismissed, the reactionary Court party nominated Foullon as Controller-General of Finances and minister of the king's household in the new government. Foullon became unpopular on all sides. The farmers-general resented his severity, and the Parisians his wealth, viewed as resulting from the exploitation of the poor. An unsubstantiated rumor accused him of having said during an earlier famine: \\"If those rascals have no bread, then let them eat hay\\". A staunch conservative, he also was very hostile to Louis Philippe d'Orléans' circle. Foullon was a member of the Parlement of Paris immediately prior to the French Revolution, nicknamed Ame damnée (familiar demon). Refuge and murder After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, Foullon fled from Paris to his friend Antoine de Sartine's house at Viry-Châtillon, a few miles south of the capital. Aware of the feeling against him Foullon had reports of his own death circulated. On 22 July Foullon was captured by the peasants on Sartine's estate, and taken to the Hôtel de Ville. Made to walk barefoot, he had a bundle of hay tied to his back, was given peppered vinegar to drink, and had the sweat on his face wiped off with nettles. In Paris Jean Sylvain Bailly and the Marquis de La Fayette tried to intervene but Foullon was dragged by the populace to the Place de Grève. As he was hanged from a lamp-post, the rope broke three times in a row — so members of the crowd decided to behead him instead, before parading his head on a pike with his mouth stuffed with grass, hay and excrement.Simon Schama, page 405 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Foullon's son-in-law Bertier de Sauvigny, the intendant of Paris was confronted by the severed head before being lynched himself. The nature of the killing of both Foullon and Bertier was endorsed by Antoine Barnave, a member of the new National Legislative Assembly, with the comment: \\"What, then, is their blood so pure?\\".Simon Schama, page 406 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Foullon's killing is mentioned in Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. It is also discussed in Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (1791), in which Paine likens Foullon's ordeal to that of Robert-François Damiens, executed in 1757 following an attempted regicide, in order to argue that the Reign of Terror was the result of behaviour learned from the rulers of the Ancien Régime.

He did residencies at Pennsylvania Hospital in general surgery and urology and taught urology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He served in the US Navy Medical Corps with the rank of lieutenant commander from 1968 to 1971. In 1976, von Eschenbach began his long association with The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, beginning as a urologic oncology fellow, and becoming chair of the department of urology in 1983. He was founding director of the Prostate Cancer Research Program in 1996, director of the Genitourinary Cancer Center, and held the Roy M. and Phyllis Gough Huffington Clinical Research Distinguished Chair in Urologic Oncology. Driven by his father's prostate cancer, he specialized in the disease. Von Eschenbach was president- elect of the American Cancer Society when he was selected by President George W. Bush to head the NCI in December 2001. As director of the NCI he announced in 2003 that his organization's goal was to \\"eliminate suffering and death\\" caused by cancer by the year 2015. However, under von Eschenbach's leadership the FDA has been criticized for being too risk averse when considering life saving treatments for desperate, dying patients. For example, in 2007 the FDA failed to approve Provenge for the treatment of late stage prostate cancer against the recommendation of an independent advisory committee. Von Eschenbach was criticized for overruling his staff recommendations, and approving the Menaflex knee implant, made by ReGen Biologics Inc., New Jersey, on a fast-track basis, after four New Jersey congressmen lobbied on ReGen's behalf.

The crime, regarded as one of the most infamous in Australia's history, caused massive shock at the time and attracted huge public attention, and was the country's first well known kidnap for ransom. The police investigation that led to the capture and conviction of his murderer, an immigrant named Stephen Bradley, is often considered as pioneering, sophisticated, and the beginning of modern forensic investigation in Australia. Background By 1960, the construction of the Sydney Opera House was proving increasingly expensive, so the New South Wales government initiated numerous Opera House lotteries to help raise money. The A£100,000 first prize (equivalent to A$2.9 million in 2017 values) for Lottery 10 was won by Bazil Thorne (ticket 3932) in the lottery drawn on Wednesday 1 June 1960. As there was no real conception of the need for privacy for lottery winners at that time, and also for the sake of transparency, images and private details of lottery wins were published on the front pages of Sydney newspapers. It was also revealed that the prize would be paid by Thursday 7 July. The Thorne family consisted of Bazil, his wife Freda, older daughter Cheryl (who had been institutionalised), son Graeme (8), and younger daughter Belinda (3). They lived at 79 Edward Street, a rented house in the Sydney suburb of Bondi. Thorne's morning routine was to wait at the corner of Wellington and O'Brien streets, a walk of approximately 300 metres, where a family friend, Phyllis Smith, would pick him up and take him to school with her sons. On the morning of 7 July, five weeks after the win, Thorne left for school as usual at 8:30 AM, but when Smith came to collect him at 8:40, he was nowhere to be seen. Smith drove to the Thornes' home to find out if he was going to school. Surprised, Freda Thorne confirmed that he was and wondered if he might have arrived at the school by some other means. Smith drove to the school, The Scots College in Bellevue Hill, but returned upon finding out Thorne was not there. A concerned Freda Thorne then called the New South Wales police to report him missing. Ransom demand At 9:40 AM, 70 minutes after Thorne had left for school, a man with a noticeable foreign accent telephoned the Thorne household. Sergeant Larry O'Shea of Bondi Police had already arrived around 9:30, and took the telephone from Freda Thorne, pretending to be Bazil Thorne (who was out of town in Kempsey on business). The kidnapper stated: \\"I have your boy. I want £25,000 before 5 o’clock this afternoon. I’m not fooling. If I don’t get the money before 5 o’clock, I’ll feed the boy to the sharks.\\" O'Shea expressed doubt as to his ability to get hold of such a large sum of money, being unaware that the Thornes had recently won the lottery. The caller then said that he would call back at 5:00 PM with more details, and hung up. At 9:47 PM the kidnapper phoned again, but the telephone was answered by a different police officer (also pretending to be Bazil Thorne), who stalled for time to allow for a phone trace to happen. The kidnapper started to give instructions that the money was to be put in two paper bags, but then hung up abruptly without providing further instructions.  Investigation  The police had been busy during the first day of the kidnapping, conducting a concentrated search near the Thorne house in Bondi. News of the kidnapping soon leaked to Bill Jenkings of the Sydney Daily Mirror, and at 8.30 PM a public appeal was made on television from Bondi Police Station by NSW Police Commissioner Colin Delaney, then briefly by an emotional Bazil Thorne. The next evening (Friday, 8 July), the focus of the investigation moved to Sydney's north-eastern suburbs, when Thorne's school case was found near Seaforth. On the same day a tip was received that a boy matching Thorne's description was seen with two men heading out of Pennant Hills. On 11 July, Thorne's school cap and the contents of the case were found nearby. Soon after the discovery, an official reward of £5,000 was declared, and another £15,000 was offered by two newspapers, leading to a number of hoax calls. Investigators (now led by Ray Kelly, and with the collaboration of Sydney's underworld) followed other pieces of evidence. Some weeks before the kidnapping (on Tuesday, 14 June), a foreign man, acting as an investigator, had called at the Thornes' residence seeking a \\"Mr Bognor\\", also asking Freda Thorne to confirm their as yet unlisted telephone number. A similar looking man had also been seen numerous times by multiple witnesses in the park opposite the house. Also, at 8:20 AM on the morning of the kidnapping, some witnesses had seen an iridescent blue 1955 Ford Customline double-parked on the corner of Francis and Wellington streets, near where Thorne was usually picked up. Investigators, checking more than 270,000 registration records, established that there were 5,000 vehicles matching this general description. Assuming the car had been either borrowed or stolen, officers interviewed owners, including Bradley on 24 August, about car use at that time, but he denied having been in Bondi that day. On Tuesday 16 August, nearly six weeks after the kidnapping, and 1.5 km from where the school case was found, Thorne's body was finally discovered hidden on vacant land in Grandview Grove, Seaforth in Sydney, and identified at the City Morgue by his father the next day. Wrapped in a blue tartan picnic blanket, and tucked into a ledge, he was tied with string, had been gagged with a scarf, and was still wearing his school uniform. The blanket containing the body had been there for some time; two local children had known about it, but the discovery was only made when mentioned to their parents around 7:00 PM that day. Forensic examination of the blanket showed it to be No.0639 (of 3,000) which had been manufactured at Onkaparinga Mills in South Australia, between 6 June 1955 and 19 January 1956. It had been sold in Melbourne, and bought by a friend of Bradley's wife for her. Also, two tree types (Chamaecyparis pisifera and Cupressus glabra) that were not present at the vacant lot where the body was found were identified in the blanket, along with Pekingese and blonde human hair. Examination of the body showed cuts and abrasions and internal trauma, and it was clear that the boy had died from either asphyxiation, a skull fracture, or a combination of the two. Forensic experts (including from the School of Agriculture, University of Sydney) gathered time data from Thorne's body, his stomach contents, fungi on his shoes, and fly larvae (identified as Calliphora stygia). Examination established that he had been murdered within twenty-four hours of the kidnapping, and dumped soon afterwards. In addition, soil scrapings from the body and the blanket showed tiny fragments of pink limestock mortar, revealing that his body had been stored under a house. Police then searched for a house with a blue car, pink mortar, and with the two trees growing in the yard. Although cypresses could be found growing in many people's yards, the combination of the two together was rare. Following a tip-off from a postman, a house was identified at 28 Moore Street in the suburb of Clontarf, 1.5 km from where the body was found. Police visited the house on Monday, 3 October and learnt that it had been occupied by a Hungarian immigrant named Stephen Bradley. Bradley had also owned an iridescent blue 1955 Ford Customline (registration number AYO-382), had a Pekingese as a family pet, and his wife had dyed blonde hair. However, Bradley and his family had vacated the house on 7 July for a rented flat at 49 Osborne Street in Manly, and had left Australia for London with his family a week earlier, on 26 September, aboard . Extradition and trial When Himalaya docked at Colombo, Ceylon, on Monday 10 October, two Sydney policemen, Sergeants Brian Doyle and Jack Bateman, were waiting for Bradley. After five weeks of legal wrangling, Bradley was extradited to Australia on 18 November 1960, allegedly making a verbal confession to Bateman just before the BOAC flight landed in Sydney. The next day at 10:00 AM, Bradley signed a written confession in English (although he later retracted it), part of which states: > \\"I went out and watched the Thorne boy leaving the house and seen him for > about three mornings and I have seen where he went. And one morning I have > followed him to the school at Bellevue Hill. One or two mornings I have seen > a pick him up, and take him to the school. On the day we moved from Clontarf > I went out to Edward Street. I parked the car in a street I don’t know the > name of the street it is off Wellington Street. I have got out from the car, > and I waited on the , the boy walked down to the car.\\" The trial at the Central Criminal Court in Sydney began on Monday 20 March 1961. Examination of Bradley's past revealed that he had been born Istvan Baranyay in Budapest on 15 March 1926 and, having survived World War II and the communist takeover, he arrived in Melbourne aboard Skaugum on 28 March 1950. A divorcee since 1948, in 1952 he had then married and had a child with Eva Maria Lazlo in Melbourne and lived with her until she died (perhaps suspiciously) in a car accident on 26 February 1955. Baranyay later anglicised and changed his name by deed poll to Stephen Leslie Bradley in August 1956. In 1958 he married a third time to Magda Wittman, a divorcee with two children. Feeling pressure to care for his expanded family, he was forced to work hard at a number of different jobs as their savings dwindled. He was then possibly inspired by the April 1960 Peugeot ransom case in Paris to attempt the abduction. In court, Bradley pleaded not guilty to murder but was identified as the man seen by witnesses (including by Freda Thorne). He admitted the kidnapping, providing details of how he posed as a driver and fabricated a tale to persuade Thorne into his car that day. Taking him west to Centennial Park, he had then assaulted the boy, rendered him unconscious, then tied and wrapped him up in a blanket, and placed him in the boot, before driving north across the Harbour Bridge and making the first ransom call. Arriving at his home in nearby Clontarf, he rechecked the boy, but at around 3:00 PM when he checked again, he claimed that Thorne had apparently suffocated in the back of his car. Forensic experts soon disproved this by connecting a breathing mask to the inside of the boot and breathing the air for seven hours. Bradley's wife was also brought in from London to testify, but there was no clear evidence of her involvement. The high-profile trial for murder lasted nine days, and he was sentenced to penal servitude for life, the maximum penalty provided in NSW for murder. A later Court of Criminal Appeal hearing was dismissed unanimously on 22 May 1961. Aftermath News surrounding the case led to an overwhelming sense of public shock, disbelief, and anger which, alongside later events such as the Wanda Beach Murders and the Beaumont disappearance, \\"marked an end of innocence in Australian life\\". Lottery procedures in Australia were changed after the Thorne case, with winners being given the option of remaining anonymous. The case also proved pivotal to the development of forensic science and new kidnapping laws in Australia. Kidnapping for ransom was seen as a primarily American phenomenon, most notably in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Prior to the Thorne case, such events were unknown in Australia. The late crime journalist Alan Dower was of the opinion that Thorne was not Bradley's initial target. Dower's theory was that his younger sister was Bradley's goal and that he had no intention of killing her. At 4, she was young enough that, if she had been kidnapped and then released, she would not have been able to give any useful information that could identify her kidnapper. However, she was also so young that she was never away from her parents. After the trial, Bradley was sent to Goulburn gaol, where he worked as a hospital orderly and was kept protected from other prisoners. His wife and children returned to Europe, and Magda Bradley divorced him in 1965. On 6 October 1968 he died in prison of a heart attack aged 42 while playing in the gaol tennis competition, and was buried in the Catholic section of Goulburn cemetery. Regarding the crime, \\"Bradley never showed any remorse whatsoever\\". The Thornes, meanwhile, moved to another nearby suburb, Rose Bay. Bazil Thorne died in December 1978. Freda Thorne died in 2012 aged 86.  Media  Thorne's murder was the focus of the Crime Investigation Australia season 1 episode \\"Kid for Ransom\\" aired in 2005. In 2008, a children's detective book titled Kidnapping File: the Graeme Thorne Case was developed by Amanda Howard and published in the U.S. The book Kidnapped by Mark Tedeschi QC was published in 2015, and in January 2018, Casefile True Crime Podcast featured the Thorne kidnapping in Case 75.

The university is regarded nationally and internationally as a center of excellence having graduated numerous important names in Brazilian history. History Part of the São Paulo Campus on Maria Antônia Street In 1870, the American Presbyterian missionary Rev. George Whitehill Chamberlain and his wife Mary Annesley founded a private grammar school inside their home. The classes were held in their living room and, a few years later, the \\"American School\\" was established as a center of excellence in São Paulo. The Chamberlains' American School was revolutionary for the Brazilian standards at that time: no corporal punishment on students was permitted, and both boys and girls could attend classes. Even though the Chamberlains were openly Presbyterians, students from all ethnic backgrounds, social classes, and religious denominations were welcome. The fame of academic rigor allied to religious tolerance soon reached the United States. In 1896, John Theron Mackenzie, an attorney from Phelps, New York, and his sisters donated US$50,000 \\"for the establishment of an engineering school to be built under the auspices of Mr. Chamberlain\\". The Mackenzie building was built the next year, and the college was named in their honor.

It is District 7 of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. History The Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) was founded in 1907 by a group of educators from four public and private Pittsburgh schools who sought increased regulation and governance of student athletic eligibility and interscholastic athletic competition. The founding schools in the league included Shady Side Academy, Allegheny Prep, Pittsburgh Fifth Avenue High School, and Pittsburgh Central High School. William R. Crabbe of Shady Side Academy acted as a central force in the formation of the League and served as its first president. At its inception the league was poorly received by the public and the press, and found it difficult to enforce its rules. However, the league slowly spread throughout the Pittsburgh area. The league controlled the growth to small numbers that they could handle. As such, the only organization absorbed as a whole was the old Allegheny Valley League. Following the local success of WPIAL, the idea was brought to the whole state in 1914 when the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) was founded. Within PIAA, WPIAL has been designated as District 7, and since 1982, WPIAL/District 7. Although officially known as District 7, the WPIAL is grandfathered to keep the older name due to it predating the PIAA. Originally numbering three high schools, WPIAL had a high of 156 participating school as late as the 1981–82 school year. As of October 2012, there are 137 high schools and 148 junior high school members in the WPIAL. Member schools The league is responsible for administering the interscholastic athletic participation/competition of public school districts and private schools located in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Lawrence, Washington, Westmoreland counties in Western Pennsylvania. Exceptions as of the 2015–16 school year include: *Ligonier Valley School District in Westmoreland County participates in District 6. *Slippery Rock Area School District and Moniteau School District in Butler County participate in District 10 and District 9 respectively. *Wilmington Area School District in Lawrence and Mercer counties participates in District 10. *Since 2012, four high schools from Pittsburgh Public Schools in Allegheny County, which makes up PIAA District 8, compete in the WPIAL for baseball, softball, soccer, swimming, tennis, golf, and cross country. *Altoona Area High School and Hollidaysburg Area High School in Blair County were granted \\"conditional membership\\" for football and began competing in District 7 in 2013. The condition stated: If the PIAA does approve an expansion from four to six classifications in football, the WPIAL will look at its alignments to see if the schools' inclusion will benefit the WPIAL's scheduling.\\" Such an expansion was approved to take effect for the 2016–17 school year. Hollidaysburg intended to leave District 7 after the conclusion of the 2015–16 season.

Biography Portrait of Antokolsky by Ilya Repin, 1914 Mordukh Matysovich AntokolskyBoris Schatz: The Father of Israeli Art Yigal Zalmona, The Israel Museum, 2006, signed letter from Paris, p.18. was born in Vilnius (Antokol city district), Lithuania (at the time part of the Russian Empire). He studied in the Imperial Academy of Arts (1862-68) at St. Petersburg. He first began with Jewish themes, statues: \\"Jewish Tailor\\", \\"Nathan The Wise\\", \\"Inquisition's Attack against Jews\\", \\"The Talmudic Debate\\". From 1868–1870, Mark Antokolsky lived in Berlin. His statue of Ivan the Terrible (1870) was purchased for the Hermitage by Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The latter approved his work and awarded the sculptor the title of Academic. Antokolsky believed that sculpture was a social and humane ideal. In order to improve his failing health, he moved to the Italian resorts in 1871 and settled in Paris six years later. Every year Antokolsky would come back to his native town of Vilnius during his summer holidays. Namely here he created his first significant work, high relief \\"A Jewish Tailor\\", during his summer holidays of 1864. The work of the young sculptor provoked debate in the Academy in Petersburg. On 28 October 1864, the Council of the Academy decided to award Antokolski with the Small Silver Medal for the \\"Tailor\\" by the majority of votes. While in Vilnius the following year, Antokolski created another high relief - \\"A Stingy Man,\\" which is sometimes referred to as \\"A Stingy Jew Counting his Coins\\". The artist was born into a poor family and saw how his father's financial situation improved. The sculpture might have reflected Antokolski's feelings towards his native town of Vilnius, and firstly to his father. This work as well as the first sculpture was positively evaluated by Vasily Stasov who saw \\"the features of the simple truth, the things that, previously, nobody dared to think about in sculpture\\" in the works of the artist. In 1865, the high relief \\"Stingy Man\\" was awarded the Grand Silver Medal of the Academy. In later years the sculptor continued working on Jewish themes, which developed into complex, yet unfinished compositions: \\"Talmud Dispute\\" (1866–1868) and \\"Inquisition Attacks the Jews\\" (1868–1869). The \\"Inquisition\\" was M. Antokolski's last work on the Jewish topic in his student years. According to the review of the Art Academy, Antokolsky was granted personal name of honorary citizen \\"for wonderful knowledge of art\\" on 7 April 1870. This fact was also entered into an archival record. Moreover, an inscription remained that Morduchas was excluded from the revision register of Antakalnis Jewish community as a person awarded the name of an honorary citizen. In 1871 Antokolsky started his first \\"Russian\\" sculpture, \\"Ivan the Terrible\\", which made an enormous impression on all valuators and connoisseurs of art. When Emperor Alexander II saw the sculpture he asked to make its bronze copy and allocated the sculptor advance payment of 4,000 roubles. Pavel Tretyakov ordered a marble copy for his gallery. The funds received enabled the artist to resolve his personal problems. In 1871 (in Vilnius) Antokolski met Jelena (Gene), daughter of a rich Vilnius merchant Judelis Giršovičius Apatovas. The two married on 6 September 1872. Mark Antokolski in his Paris studio. Antokolsky used 4,000 rubles for the \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" to buy half of a big house in Vilnius, the other part of which had previously belonged to his wife. In 1876, upon his regular visits to Vilnius, Antokolsky rebuilt the house. After 1876, Antokolsky was a rare visitor to his native town due to illnesses, work, and exhibitions in Paris and Italy, which took almost all of his time. However, the artist did not break his links with Jewish life. Concern over his nation urged Antokolsky to return to his work \\"Inquisition Attacks the Jews\\", started 30 years before in Vilnius. In Rome, Antokolsky completed the statue of Peter the Great for Peterhof Palace in 1872, with its copies for Taganrog and Archangelsk. In 1878 Antokolski exhibited most of his works at the Paris Universal exposition, and received the Grand Prize. In 1880, the personal exhibition of the artist was held in Saint Petersburg, and he was given the rank of professor. Antokolsky left for Paris the same year, and stayed in the French capital until the end of his life, apart from periods on Lake Maggiore, in northern Italy. He realised here the following works: \\"Spinoza\\" (1881), \\"Mephistopheles\\" (1884), \\"Yaroslav the Wise\\" (1889), \\"Nestor the Chronicler\\" (1889) and \\"Yermak Timofeevich\\" (1891). Several of his small- size sculptures are in the European Art collection of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. He had also planned a monument to Catherine II in Vilnius. However, with the chronic stomach disease getting more severe, the artist suddenly died on 9 July (27 June according to the old calendar) in Frankfurt (Germany). The last work was completed by I. Ginzburg after the sculptor's death. The monument has not survived. Antokolski was buried in St. Petersburg. The train with a special carriage went via Vilnius. Antokolski was buried on the 18th (6th according to the old calendar) of July 1902 in the Jewish part of Preobrazhenskoye Cemetery in St. Petersburg. His grave and tombstone can still be found there, not far from the entrance gate, but were not well maintained and cared for at least up to the 1990s.

Lev Leviev has a net worth of $1.0 billion as of March 2018, and has been a philanthropist for Hasidic Jewish causes in Eastern Europe and Israel. Beginning in the 1990s, Leviev avoided being directly involved with the Yeltsin family, and nurtured ties with Vladimir Putin. His diamond mining investments in Angola and his investments in Israeli settlements have been the target of protests. A prominent member of the Bukhari Jewish community, he is president of the World Congress of Bukharian Jews. Early life Leviev was born in Samarkand, Uzbek SSR in 1956. His family moved to Israel in 1971 where he lived until 2007 when he moved to London. As of 2018, he lives in Russia. His parents, Avner and Chana Leviev, were prominent members of the Bukharian Jewish community, and Leviev is a practicing Orthodox Jew. He is a supporter of the Chabad movement, but as a Bukharan Jew he was brought up in the Bukharan liturgy. In 1971, when he was fifteen, his family emigrated from Uzbekistan to Israel. =Start in the diamond trade= Shortly afterwards, Leviev began to work as an apprentice in a diamond polishing plant, learning the 11 steps of the diamond cutting process. After serving in the communications directorate of the Israel Defense Forces, he established his own diamond polishing plant. In 1992, he moved to Russia and purchased Russia's oldest jewelry factory, Ruis Diamonds Ltd. of Moscow which specializes in fancy cutting and high-end ideal cuts of larger diamonds and competes with Smolensk Cristal, and the Moscow Jewelry Factory (). Valery Rudakov (), a representative with the Main Directorate of Precious Metals and Diamonds (Glavalmazzolot) and the former head of the Yakutskalmaz trust, facilitated Leviev's ownership of Ruis Diamonds. Early ties to Jewish causes After the Revolutions of 1989, Leviev expanded his business endeavors into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He received the blessings for success in business and personal support of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson for his philanthropic activities, which include \\"an army of some 10,000 Jewish functionaries from Ukraine to Azerbaijan, including 300 rabbis. Most of the 300 rabbis are Chabadniks\\" - adherents of the Brooklyn- based Chabad Hasidic group. In particular he sponsors many of the activities of the Jewish Learning Initiative. =Pro-Putin support= Leviev organized the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia (FEOR) () in 1997 as a pro- Putin organization for Russian Jews in order to counter the Russian Jewish Congress (REC) () which was formed by Vladimir Gusinsky in 1996 as an organization for Russian Jews that became highly critical of Putin. Business interests Leviev is an investor in the diamond industry, real estate and chemicals. By an agreement, signed in October 2006, Leviev hoped to get into the incarceration business, as a concessionaire for the first private prison in Israel. However, in September 2009, the Israeli High Court of Justice declared private prisons unconstitutional in Israel. Leviev is currently controlling shareholder and chairman of Africa-Israel which has numerous large real estate investments in Russia. Africa-Israel is on the verge of insolvency, asking to restructure NIS 21 billion of debt.TA market drops as Africa Israel plunges  Business News  Jerusalem Post Trying to save the company from bankruptcy, justice Varda Alshech has confirmed the debt- restructuring arrangement between Africa-Israel and its creditors. However, the justice expressed her disapproval: \\"The arrangement is far from being the best,\\" Alshech said, because the company \\"is passing on the damage of its investments to its investors.\\" Additionally, he is an international investor in residential real estate, shopping malls, energy, fashion, telecommunications, and media. Leviev had purchased 60% of the company in 1996 for $400 million. By 2007 it had swelled to $8 billion in market value. With the onset of the 2007–2008 global financial crisis the value of the company plunged, with company debt reportedly totalling $5.5 billion in September 2009. Leviev owns diamond mines in Russia and Africa, and is a major competitor to the De Beers international diamond cartel. In 2005, Africa- Israel completed a $230 million 5,800-apartment project in Modi'in Illit, an ultra-Orthodox settlement in the West Bank. In early 2007, Africa-Israel opened a luxury jewelry store on Old Bond Street in London and was considering plans to invest billions in the Far East, Argentina, Brazil and Russia. Soon thereafter the global sub-prime mortgage crisis broke, and the value of Africa-Israel's real estate investments plummeted, particularly in New York, where it had invested heavily. =Debt restructuring= Following the Financial crisis of 2007–2008, Africa Israel Investments was hurt by the drop of real estate values in the United States, Russia and eastern Europe. It defaulted on a series of bonds and in 2010 it restructured 7.4 billion shekels of debt. In 2016, Africa Israel Investments sought a second debt settlement. In a recorded conversation that was leaked to Israel Channel 10 News, Lev Leviev is heard saying: \\"I shit on every bank, but they haven't been able to make me move a centimeter because I don't owe any of them money, to no bank in the world. I piss on every bank from above, even Rakefet\\" (referring to Bank Leumi CEO Rakefet Russak-Aminoach) =Angolan diamonds= As De Beers came under fire during the blood diamonds furor, Leviev increasingly came to dominate the legal Angola diamond market through the Angola Selling Corporation (Ascorp) formed in early 2000 in which the Angolan government maintains half the stake in Ascorp and Leviev and the Omega Diamonds of Antwerp, Belgium, each have about a quarter stake in Ascorp. At the same time, all contracts signed with Angola Exploration, Exploitation, Lapidation and Trading Company of Diamonds (Endiama), Angola's state owned diamond marketing company, were declared void which hastened De Beers exit from Angola and thus allowed Leviev to gain a large stake in Angolan diamonds. Leviev says he presented Angola with a plan to reduce smuggling and increase revenue by funneling diamonds through only one source, while others claim the deal was clinched through Leviev’s connections with obscure Russian businessmen. Leviev focuses on the benefits his company brings Angola, arguing that before his involvement in 1998, Angola’s tax revenue from diamonds was under $10 million but rose to $49 million by 2001: “The government of Angola has obviously profited from this venture.” When critics query how his company benefits not just the government but the people of Angola, he answers that the Leviev Group's heavy investments in Angolan diamonds \\"will change the informal way of doing business into a more formalized, educated system that helps individual families... We want to help people who work with their hands. We want Angolans to develop many different new skills.” New York Magazine reported in 2007 that a security company hired by Leviev had been accused by a local human rights group that year \\"of participating in practices of 'humiliation, whipping, torture, sexual abuse, and, in some cases, assassinations.' Leviev did not directly respond to the charges, but noted his charitable activities in Angola. Both Isabel Dos Santos and Leviev, who has a majority ownership, are partners in Angola's first and, at the time, only kimberlite mine at Catoca in the Cuango Valley. In 2014, the Catoca mine was owned by Alrosa with a 32.8% stake, Angolan government holding a 32.8% stake, and Lev Leviev International (LLI) with an 18% stake, and Odebrecht holding a 16.4% stake. In December 2018, the Luaxe kimberlite deposit named Luele, which is only 25 kilometers from the Catoca mine, will be developed by the Catoca Mining Company which is owned by Endiama and Alrosa each with 41% stake and the Lev Leviev International Holding BV with an 18% stake. Catoca Mining has a 50.5% stake in the Luaxe deposit and expects to begin industrial production at Luaxe after 2020. With its headquarters at Saurimo, Lunda Sul province, the Catoca Mining Company is the fourth largest producer of diamonds in the world and produces 86.3% by volume and 60.3% by monetary value of Angolan diamonds. VTB will finance the development of Luele which is one of the largest diamond deposits in the world and is expected to more than double Angola's diamond output by 2022. = Alaska Diamonds = The surge in diamond price in 2011 has caused diamond rushes in lesser known areas. It gave Leviev the chance to finally break into the US diamond market, giving birth to new towns all over Alaska. Leviev was recently quoted as saying: “This stampede for diamonds is now making one of the loneliest regions a bit noisier, and a whole lot wealthier.” In the Northwest Territories, companies are extracting the equivalent of a coffee can full of diamonds each day. The gems within that can are collectively worth $1.4 million. Leviev sees this new rush in the Alaska region as a new great addition to his already successful diamond empire. The mine which Leviev has procured has a 10-year mining license and has already been successful for the past 5 years. Some investors also claim that the takeover of this mine was due to Levievs strong government connections and an unknown Texan company. =Israeli settlements= Leviev is involved in the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Leviev’s Danya Cebus company, a subsidiary of Africa-Israel, subcontracted the construction of Mattityahu East to Shaya Boymelgreen. Danya Cebus is also building part of Har Homa and Maale Adumim. In 1999, Leviev's company Danya Cebus announced plans to build new homes in the settlement of Ariel. Through another subsidiary, LIDAR, Leviev appears to be the sole realtor-developer of the settlement of Zufim. Leviev's devotion to settlement construction have drawn protest from outside the Old Bond Street store in his London home, to the Leviev-owned jewelry store in New York City, and has impelled Oxfam to make it clear that Leviev has not donated to the charity. UNICEF has also advised Leviev that they will not partner with or accept any contributions from him due to the controversy. In a press release, a spokesperson for Leviev described the protests as \\"politically motivated\\" and accused protesters of \\"deliberately neglect[ing]... extensive humanitarian and philanthropic work, which includes building schools, orphanages, and fostering economic development in communities around the world.\\" Anti-Defamation League head Abraham Foxman condemned UNICEF's decision as \\"selective political discrimination\\" that \\"only gives legitimacy to those who would seek to promote a boycott of the State of Israel and its supporters.\\" In April 2009, following public pressure for a boycott, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that it would not be renting its Tel Aviv embassy from Leviev's Africa-Israel company. In 2013, the Norwegian finance ministry, after a review of Africa-Israel's activities, announced that Norway's oil fund was now allowed to re-invest in Africa- Israel. However, on 30.01.2014 Africa Israel Investments Ltd was placed on the exclusion list, based on \\"Serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war or conflict\\", and has remained there since. =Links to Trump family= According to an article published in The Guardian on July 24, 2017, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner sealed a real estate deal in 2015 worth $295 million to purchase space in the former New York Times Building on 43rd Street near Times Square from Lev Avnerovich Leviev's firms Africa Israel Investments and Five Mile Capital. Later, in October 2016, Kushner used this space as a basis for a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank. The ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests attracted the justice department’s special counsel, Robert Mueller while Mueller was investigating alleged Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election. Philanthropy Leviev is a major supporter of Jewish philanthropic causes and president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS (FJC), an umbrella body representing Jewish communities across the former Soviet Union. He is the founder of the Ohr Avner Foundation (named for Leviev's father). A prominent member of the Bukharan Jewish community, he serves as president of the World Congress of Bukharian Jews. Personal life Leviev moved to Hampstead, London, with his wife Olga, son Joshua and their daughter, Ruthie, in 2007. As a keen follower of golf, Leviev also maintains a house in the beach resort of Ponte Vedra, Florida. As of 2018, Leviev lives in Russia. On November 6, 2018, Lev Leviev's sons, Zevulun and Moshe, were arrested in Israel for suspected illegal diamond smuggling from Russia to Israel through LLD Diamonds.

They first appeared on the network in VicRail teacup livery in 1981 to replace the last of the 60-year-old Tait trains. More were ordered after the failed refurbishment and subsequent withdrawal of the Harris trains. In total 570 carriages (380 motor cars and 190 trailer cars, a total of 95 six carriage sets) were built by Comeng, Dandenong. Description The Comeng trains are single deck and are semi-permanently coupled as M-T-M (motor- trailer-motor) sets, but these sets spend much of their time coupled in pairs as six-carriage sets. Comeng trains have power operated doors that must be pulled open by hand but are closed by the driver. The trains were the first suburban trains in Melbourne to have air-conditioning in the passenger saloon. (The older Hitachi trains had driver only air-conditioning fitted more recently.Vicsig: Hitachi Trains) They operate in larger numbers on the Northern, Dandenong, Cross City and Sandringham group lines, although some continue to run on the Burnley and Clifton Hill group lines which are serviced by a higher proportion of newer X'Trapolis trains. The design of Melbourne's Comeng trains is closely related to that of TransAdelaide's diesel-electric 3000 class railcars. Comeng trains will be replaced by the new High Capacity Metro Trains on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines from early 2021. History The trains first ran in 1981. By the middle of 1984, 38 sets had been delivered, and some older rolling stock had begun to be phased out. The order was increased from 50 to 95 six-car sets, with the aim of completely replacing the Tait and Harris sets by 1988. Set 381M-1041T-382M was the first delivered in the Metropolitan Transit green and yellow scheme, though the sets including 27T and 28T had been repainted (with those cars renumbered 1027T and 1028T respectively) before then.Newsrail April 1984 p.120 Notably, when the 41st set was delivered the front panels of the motor carriages were still silver-framed rather than yellow.http://vicsig.net/photo/3051 The 45th set delivered had custom decals applied to the sides celebrating the halfway point through the order. These had been removed by 1 February 1991.Newsrail April 1991 p121 =Refurbishment= 2000 - 2003 Between 2000 and 2003, the two train operators at the time, Connex and M>Train, had Alstom and EDi Rail respectively refurbish the trains.Australian Railway Industry Corporation: EDI Rail The Alstom and EDi Rail sets have a number of differences, including: * Interior arrangement - The interior LED displays on the M>Train trains were in the middle, as opposed to being at both ends of the carriage on Connex sets. * Upholstery - Seats in M>Train trains are blue, while Connex opted for rainbow- textured seats. * Seating arrangement - Connex provided a different seating layout from M>Train. * Exterior front panels - Information on the train's terminus is displayed on top of the window on M>Train fleets, while Connex trains have them displaying on the left window (in the pre-refurbishment style). * Cab layout - The EDI Rail refurbished trains retained a second full- size seat on the right-hand side of the cab, originally used for the guard, whereas the Alstom sets only have a small seat, the same size as the passenger ones. * Cab fittings - The EDi Rail trains also have a windscreen-wiper on both sides, the Alstom sets only having one on the driver's side. * Light fittings - The Alstom refurbished trains have grated light coverings, while the EDi type retained the original flat coverings. Both sets had CCTV and emergency assistance panels added as part of the refurbishment program.Department of Infrastructure New and refurbished trains and trams After Connex assumed responsibility for all of Melbourne's suburban train network in 2004, the EDi refurbished trains had the M>Train exterior logos removed, and later received Connex blue and yellow side stripes, and a repainted front panel. =Concorde program= 2006 - 2007 From December 2006 both fleets were allowed to run system wide. The electronics of both Comeng types were altered to make them electronically compatible with each other, with both the PID voices and display formatting altered. Both types of Comeng can run system wide and can run in multiple unit with trains of the same or different type. =Interior rearrangements= 2009 From the beginning of March 2009, Connex ran a test set of carriages with new seating arrangement on city lines. The new arrangements removed 44 seats, making room for more standing on the train. The changes were made to accommodate the increased patronage on the Melbourne rail network. As part of its franchise agreement, Metro Trains Melbourne is required to modify the seating layout of all Comeng trains to have 2-2 seating which allows better passenger flow through the train and more standing room. So far most Comengs have had modifications to seating around the passenger doors to avoid people clogging up the doorways when a train is overcrowded. =Door upgrades= 2014 - 2015 Comeng trains still require passengers to manually open saloon doors to enter and exit the trains. Pneumatic air pressure keeps the doors closed whilst the trains are in motion, and is released by the driver when the carriages stop at station platforms. Prior to 2014, the doors were fitted with large \\"door knob\\" style handles. These made it relatively easy for unruly passengers to force the doors open, including while the train was in motion. All carriages were retrofitted with a new flat slim handle designed to make doors more difficult to force open. This followed an incident at Watergardens railway station where teenagers forced a door open while the train was moving and one jumped out, causing injury to himself. Alan Osbourne, then director of Transport Safety Victoria (TSV), informed Metro that the Comeng trains would be taken out of service if their doors were not made impossible to force open by 2017. =Life extension / retirement= 2017 - 2021 75% of the Comeng fleet are currently undertaking a life extension (stages 1/2) refurbishment program with a number of upgrades taking place including: *Upholstery - Seats in Connex rainbow-textured pattern change to Public Transport Victoria’s corporate identity in either orange or blue geometric design. *Concertina style enclosed gangways between carriages. *Improved saloon lighting and additional handholds. *LED marker lights *New vinyl stickering with PTV branding identity livery on the exterior fibreglass front panels. *Removal of external handles and step ladders at the leading end of all motor cars to reduce instances of train surfing. In December 2019, it was announced that the 31% of the existing Comeng units (Tread Units) will be further enhanced with upgrades under the third stage of the life extension programme. A number of upgrades taking place included: * Dynamic Passenger Information Screens which displays real time data. * Improved safety enhancements, including an upgrade to high definition CCTV cameras with better clarity and a wider field of view * Improvements to hearing aid links with a new and upgraded speaker system. * Improvements to the overall air compression system powering the brakes, doors, pantographs and traction systems. By end of 2021, 75% of the fleet are expected to have received the upgrades with the remainder of the non-life extended Comeng units planned to be progressively replaced by High Capacity Metro Trains which would see those units retired. In 2019 it was revealed that if the X'Trapolis 2.0s were made the Comengs could be out of service as early as 2026 Stored carriages 21 Comeng carriages have been scrapped or removed from service. Eight carriages have been scrapped: 315M, 388M, 1165T, 1109T, 533M, 305M, 1003T and 306M. 315M was burnt out at Hurstbridge on 9 April 1983, along with Tait 472M, 388M was hit by V/Line locomotive N457 at Officer, 1165T was burnt out at Northcote, 1109T was damaged in a collision at Epping,Vicsig: Comeng-1109T while 533M was burnt out by vandals at Merlynston in April 2002. Both 1109T and 533M were stored at the Ballarat Workshops and were scrapped in August 2010. In November 2012, 305M-1003T-306M crashed into a truck at Abbotts Road in Dandenong South. These cars were stored in Dandenong South near the crash site, visible from the Cranbourne Line until May 2014, when they were scrapped. Another four carriages have been stored: 500M, 671M, 672M, and 1186T. 500M was burnt out at Sandringham in 2002Vicsig: 500M burnt out at Hampton and can be seen in a yard close to the North Williamstown station side of the Newport railway workshops. 671M was partly burnt out at Gowrie. Spare cars 672M and 1186T underwent a prototype refurbishment before being stored. 671M is currently in use by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade for firefighter training. In November 2017, all remaining nine Comeng chopper carriages including the (691M-698M) motors and (1196T-1199T) trailers were not included in the new Metro contract which saw them retired out of service. These units have been supplying parts to the remaining Comeng units in service.

Description It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer growing to tall, exceptionally to tall, with a trunk up to across, and a very narrow conic crown. The bark on young trees is smooth, gray, and with resin blisters, becoming rough and fissured or scaly on old trees. The leaves are flat and needle-like, long, glaucous green above with a broad stripe of stomata, and two blue-white stomatal bands below; the fresh leaf scars are reddish. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but with the leaf bases twisted to be arranged to the sides of and above the shoot, with few or none below the shoot. The cones are erect, long, dark blackish-purple with fine yellow-brown pubescence, ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged seeds in early fall. Taxonomy There are two to three taxa in subalpine fir, treated very differently by different authors: *The Coast Range subalpine fir Abies lasiocarpa in the narrow sense, is the typical form of the species, occurring in the Pacific Coast Ranges, the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range from southeast Alaska (Panhandle mountains) south to California. *The Rocky Mountains subalpine fir is very closely related and of disputed status, being variously treated as a distinct species Abies bifolia, as a variety of Coast Range subalpine fir Abies lasiocarpa var. bifolia, or not distinguished from typical A. lasiocarpa at all. It occurs in the Rocky Mountains from southeast Alaska (eastern Alaska Range) south to Colorado. It differs primarily in resin composition, and in the fresh leaf scars being yellow-brown, not reddish. The Flora of North America treats it as a distinct species (see external links, below); the USDA includes it within A. lasiocarpa without distinction. *The corkbark fir Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica occurs in Arizona and New Mexico. It differs in thicker, corky bark and more strongly glaucous foliage. In resin composition it is closer to A. bifolia than to typical A. lasiocarpa, though the combination \\"Abies bifolia var. arizonica\\" has not been formally published. The Flora of North America includes it within A. bifolia without distinction; the USDA treats it as a distinct variety of A. lasiocarpa. Distribution Abies lasiocarpa is native to the mountains of Yukon, British Columbia and western Alberta in Western Canada; and to southeastern Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, western Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, northeastern Nevada, and the Trinity Alps of the Klamath Mountains in northwestern California in the Western United States. Range It occurs at high altitudes, from in the north of the range (rarely down to sea level in the far north), to in the south of the range; it is commonly found at and immediately below the tree line. Ecology The bark is browsed by game animals and its leaves are eaten by grouse. Songbirds, Richardson's grouse, Cascade pine squirrels, and other mammals consume the seeds.  Uses  The wood is used for general structural purposes and paper manufacture. It is also a popular Christmas tree. It is a popular ornamental tree for parks and large gardens, grown for its strongly glaucous-blue foliage. The cultivar Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica 'Compacta' is suitable for smaller gardens, growing as a shrub to tall by broad. In the UK It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Some Plateau Indian tribes drank or washed in a subalpine fir boil for purification or to make their hair grow.

The escalating violence and extremism, which had been provoked by the military's cancellation of the legislative elections in 1991 that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), an Islamist party, were expected to win, compelled the major political parties to unite under the auspices of the Catholic Community of Sant'Egidio in Rome. The community had previously played an important role in the drafting of the Rome General Peace Accords in 1992 which ended the civil war in Mozambique. The presence of representatives from the FIS as well as the National Liberation Front (FLN) and Socialist Forces Front (FFS) at these negotiations was extremely significant; the three parties collectively accounted for 80 per cent of the votes in the 1991 election. At the end of the negotiation period, a joint statement released by the parties in which they rejected violence to achieve political goals and called for respect of human rights and democracy. The final version of the platform included demands for the reinstatement of democracy through the holding of new parliamentary elections and the repeal of the dissolution of the FIS, independent investigations of human rights abuses following the coup d'état, the withdrawal of the Algerian army from the political sphere, and a renewed commitment to the Constitution. The platform was meant to be a model of democratic governance and political reconciliation with the goal of restoring a national consensus and fostering an inclusive political culture in Algeria. The commitment by the FIS was significant as it revealed its commitment to the peaceful transition of political power, however at the time of signing fragmentation within the Islamists was already well entrenched, with both of its armed wings expressing dissatisfaction with the platform at the time of signing. The Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) called the platform as a diversion, while the increasingly radicalized Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA) presented three ultimatums including punishment of secularist Algerian generals, the banning of the communist and atheist political parties and the liberation of important Islamist leaders, including Abdelhak Layada, from prison. Ultimately, the platform would never be implemented due to the lack of endorsement it received from the armed Islamists and categorical rejection by President Zeroul who denounced the platform as a threat to national sovereignty since it invited foreign intervention into the internal affairs of Algeria. The platform was signed by: * Ali Yahiya, representing the Algerian Human Rights League (LADDH). * Abdelhamid Mehri, representing the National Liberation Front (FLN). * Hocine Aït Ahmed and Ahmed Djeddai, representing the Socialist Forces Front (FFS). * Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam, representing the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). * Louisa Hanoune, representing the Workers Party (PT). * Ahmed Ben Bella and Khaled Bensmain, representing the Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA). * Abdallah Djaballah, representing the Islamic Renaissance Movement (al-Nahda) party. * Ahmed Ben Mouhammed, representing the Contemporary Muslim Algeria movement (JMC).

Total prize money is A$2,000,000. The origins of this race are associated with colonial Sydney and the growth of thoroughbred racing in the colony during the 1850s. The Australian Jockey Club initiated an Autumn race meet of initially two days and expanded it as horse racing became the most attended sport meeting. Name The inaugural running of the race was 1 May 1862 as part of the Metropolitan Autumn Meeting at Randwick. The race was known as Jockey Club Handicap and it was the third race on the card. The race attracted 9 runners over the famed 2 miles and was won by the odds on favourite Talleyrand in a time of 3 minutes 52 seconds. In 1863 the Randwick Autumn Meeting, the third race on the first day of the meet was the Randwick Grand Handicap. The race was run by five entrants with the winner Traveller in a time of 3 minutes 42 seconds. By 1865 the race was called the Randwick Grand Handicap Sweepstakes. With influx of money that was being offered by the Victoria Racing Club in Melbourne for the Melbourne Cup the AJC decided to change the name of the race in 1866 to the Sydney Gold Cup and move its scheduling to the second day of the meet. The 1866 Sydney Cup was presented to jockey Samuel Holmes and the immensely popular colonial horse, Yattendon, who demonstrated prowess by winning 11 out of his 17 starts. The gold cup was presented for the first time in this race and was made of 18 carat gold. Of the more famous horses to win the race was dual winner of the race The Barb (1868–69) and also winner of the Melbourne Cup and from the same era Carbine who also won the race twice (1889–90). In the 20th century the race held its prominence and although it never overtook the Melbourne Cup the race complemented the Australian Racing Calendar by being held in the autumn. Other dual winners include: Mosaic (1939–40), Veiled Threat (1942, 1944), Tie The Knot (1998–99). In 1973 the race was set at a distance of 3,200 metres due to the metric conversion in Australia. Kingston Town was the first to win the Sydney Cup as a Group 1 race in 1980. The distinction for the fastest recorded time is 3 minutes and 19 seconds, set by 'Apollo Eleven' in 1973 and equalled by Just A Dancer in 1991. History Electro, 1957 winner jockey Doug Weir.

Artek is a Finnish furniture company. It was founded in December 1935 by architect Alvar Aalto and his wife Aino Aalto, visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl. The founders chose a non- Finnish name, the neologism Artek was meant to manifest the desire to combine art and technology. This echoed a main idea of the International Style movement, especially the Bauhaus, to emphasize the technical expertise in production and quality of materials, instead of historical-based, eclectic or frivolous ornamentation.Thomas Kellein (Editor), Alvar & Aino Aalto: Design. Hatje Cantz Publishers, 2005. The original aim of the venture was to promote the furniture and glassware of Alvar Aalto and Aino Aalto, and to produce furnishings for their buildings. Göran Schildt, Alvar Aalto. A life's work: Architecture, Design and Art. Otava, Helsinki, 1994 Before 1935 the Aaltos' designs were manufactured by Huonekalu-ja Rakennustyötehdas Oy in Turku. That company was renamed Huonekalutehdas Korhonen Oy and moved to Littoinen, but now Artek and both companies are all part of Vitra (furniture). Artek have their own in-house designers, such as renown Ben af Schulten. Originally, the studio was set up ostensibly to assist Aalto's architects' office with interior designs for his buildings. Since Aalto's passing in 1976 the company has sold design objects by other Finnish designers, such as Juha Leiviskä and Eero Aarnio, as well as Vitra furniture. Artek's main store in Helsinki Shigeru Ban, Artek Pavilion, 2007  Representative furniture  Chairs and table by Artek at the Aalto-designed Academic Bookstore = Paimio Chair = From the very beginning of his career Alvar Aalto experimented with materials, especially wood, and even applied for patents for the bending of wood as applied in his furniture designs and as acoustic screens in his buildings. The Aaltos designed several different types of furniture and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium (1929–33). The best known of the furniture pieces is his cantilevered birch wood Paimio Chair, which was specifically designed for tuberculosis patients to sit in for long hours each day. Aalto argued that the angle of the back of the chair was the perfect angle for the patient to breathe most easily. The design of the chair may have been influenced by Marcel Breuer's metal Wassily Chair, though Aalto was generally negative towards metal furniture. Bayley, Stephen, Conran, Terance Design: Intelligence Made Visible. Firefly Books. 2007 pp. 63–64 The degree of bending of the wood tested the technical limits of that time. The chair is part of the permanent collections at the MoMA in New York City and the Finnish Design Museum. = 3 Leg Stool 60 = The Model No. 60 stool, designed circa 1932–1933, demonstrated Alvar Aalto's interest in basic functional, utilitarian forms. It was constructed of bent laminated birch, and originally came in all natural (plain) or curled birch, or with a black, red, or blue seat with natural (plain) legs. = 3 Leg Stool X600 = The X600 evolved from the 60. The handmade legs have the portions attached to the seat opening up into a fan, showing simultaneously the bent wood characteristic of Artek furniture and the fan motif that runs through Aalto's architecture.  Artek Pavilion  In 2007, Japanese architect Shigeru Ban designed an exhibition pavilion for Artek, built from reconstituted waste material provided by the Finnish paper manufacturer UPM. The pavilion was first used at the Milan Triennale in 2007, after which it was temporally in use outside the Design Museum, Helsinki.

Validly published names other than the correct name are called synonyms., Article 7.2 Since taxonomists may disagree as to the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, there can be more than one correct name for a particular plant.

Other spellings are called orthographical variants., Articles 60-61 The zoological equivalent of \\"correct name\\" is \\"valid name\\". Example Linnaeus' Adenanthera falcataria has many other names Different taxonomic placements may well lead to different correct names. For example, the earliest name for the fastest growing tree in the world is Adenanthera falcataria L. The \\"L.\\" stands for \\"Linnaeus\\" who first validly published the name. Adenanthera falcataria is thus one of the correct names for this plant. There are other correct names, based on different taxonomic treatments. * It can be placed in the genus Albizia, as Fosberg first did. When placed in this genus, the first choice of correct name is the new genus name followed by the earlier species epithet, giving Albizia falcataria., Article 11.4 This name cannot be used if there is already a species in the genus with this epithet, so that an illegitimate duplicate would be created., Article 53 As this is not the case, the correct name for the plant in this genus is Albizia falcataria (L.) Fosberg. \\"Fosberg\\" is the authority for the transfer to the new genus; \\"L(innaeus)\\" the authority for the 'base name' (basionym) from which the new name is derived. * It can also be placed in the genus Paraserianthes. Its correct name in that position is Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) I.C.Nielsen. * Within the genus Paraserianthes, it is placed in section Falcataria. If the section is raised in rank to become the genus Falcataria, the correct name cannot be Falcataria falcataria, as might be expected, since under the botanical code (but not the zoological code) names with the same word as both the genus and the specific epithet (tautonyms) are forbidden., Article 23.4 An alternative basionym must be sought or a new name created. The correct name is Falcataria moluccana (Miq.) Barneby and J.W.Grimes. The four names Adenanthera falcataria, Albizia falcataria, Paraserianthes falcataria and Falcataria moluccana are each correct, given that the plant is placed in these four genera.

Villa Carducci, Florence. Manente degli Uberti (1212 – 11 November 1264), known as Farinata degli Uberti, was an Italian aristocrat and military leader of the Ghibelline faction in Florence. He was considered to be a heretic by some of his contemporaries, including Dante Alighieri, who mentioned Farinata in his Inferno. Life Farinata belonged to one of the most ancient and prominent noble families of Florence, his native city. He was the leader of the Ghibelline faction in his city during the power struggles of the time. He led the Ghibellines from 1239, but after the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, in 1250, the Guelphs were able to reassert power in Florence, securing his exile from the city, along with his supporters. The exiles sought refuge in Siena, a Ghibelline stronghold. In response to the exile, Farinata allied himself with Frederick's illegitimate son, Manfred of Sicily, who was seeking to expand his alliances in order to secure himself on the throne of Sicily. In September 1260 Farinata led the Ghibelline forces to victory over the rival Guelphs at the Battle of Montaperti. As a result, he was able to capture Florence. The leading Guelph families were banished and the government of Florence was radically restructured to ensure Ghibelline dominance. Farinata's allies wanted to ensure that Florence would never again rise to threaten them. Following the example of Roman ruthlessness towards its enemy Carthage, they voted to raze Florence utterly to the ground. Only Farinata stood out against them, declaring himself to be a Florentine first and a Ghibelline second, and vowing that he would defend his native city with his own sword. The Ghibellines thereupon took the lesser course of destroying the city's defences and the homes of the leading Guelphs, knocking down 103 palaces, 580 houses, and 85 towers. When the Guelphs regained control of the city in 1266, they repeated in reverse the demolitions, by destroying every building belonging to the Uberti clan, which were in what is now Piazza della Signoria, decreeing as well that no building should ever be erected in that accursed space. This is why Palazzo Vecchio, begun in the 1290s, is not in the center of the piazza, but squeezed over to one side. Heresy Farinata degli Uberti in niche on portico of Uffizi Palace, Florence, 16th century Dante and Virgil before Farinata Farinata died at Florence in 1264. In 1283 his body and that of his wife, Adaleta, were exhumed from their resting place in Santa Reparata, and tried for heresy. They were found guilty by the Franciscan-led Inquisition, and their remains were subjected to a posthumous execution. According to Boccaccio, in his commentary on Dante, the Inquisition discovered, among other things, that Farinata denied life after death: > He was of the opinion of Epicurus, that the soul dies with the body, and > maintained that human happiness consisted in temporal pleasures; but he did > not follow these in the way that Epicurus did, that is by making long fasts > to have afterwards pleasure in eating dry bread; but was fond of good and > delicate viands, and ate them without waiting to be hungry; and for this sin > he is damned as a Heretic in this place. Therefore, Farinata appears with several other atheists and heretics in Dante's Inferno. Since they denied the immortality of the soul, their eternal punishment is to be entombed in fiery coffins, the dead among the dead, within the city of Dis. Farinata is also mentioned in C.S.

White began creating and self-publishing comics in the 1980s.He was a contributor to the literary free magazine The Black Dog published in Austin, Texas in the late eighties. His first professionally published story was \\"El Bandito Muerto\\" which appeared in Rip Off Comix in 1990. Throughout the 1990s, he contributed to a number of comics anthologies (most notably Zero Zero, Buzz and Snake Eyes), magazines (Details, Heavy Metal, Boing Boing, and others), and newspapers (Austin Chronicle and Austin American-Statesman). His books include: The Mutant Book of the Dead (Starhead Comics, 1994); Villa of the Mysteries (a limited series published by Fantagraphics, 1996–98); and The Bush Junta (Fantagraphics, 2004), a political comics anthology which he co-edited with Gary Groth. White's artwork was featured in the Comics on the Verge art show which was presented by the Yerba Buena Arts Center in 2003 and later toured galleries and universities throughout the United States. In addition to his comics work, White is co-host (with SMiles Lewis) of the Internet radio talk show PsiOp Radio which is carried on iTunes and elsewhere on the Internet. White was featured in the 1995 documentary Day 51: The True Story of Waco and in 2010 acted in the independent film Bozoland; in 2012, he played the lead role in the short film A Second Coming. White's early stories were bizarre, darkly humorous, and dealt with metaphysical themes. The Baltimore City Paper described his work as combining \\"an illustrative style reminiscent of serial adventure comic strips with the paranoia of Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminatus! Trilogy.\\" Later, his work became more political, the best known examples being \\"Dead Silence in the Brain: The CIA Assassination of John Lennon\\" (The Comics Journal Summer Special 2001); \\"Operation Northwoods\\" (The Comics Journal Winter Special 2002); \\"1963,\\" an autobiographical account of growing up in the Dallas area during the Kennedy assassination, which appeared in Roadstrips (Chronicle Books, 2006); and the aforementioned book The Bush Junta, in which White and 25 other cartoonists told the history of the George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush presidential administrations in comic strip form. White has also worked in the Western genre, one example being his story \\"Trouble in Tascosa,\\" which appeared in Hotwire 2 (Fantagraphics, 2008). In 2011, White collaborated with author Mike Kearby on Texas Tales Illustrated: The Revolution, a graphic novel about the Texas Revolution (Texas Christian University Press). In 2015, White and Kearby published a second volume of Texas Tales Illustrated: The Trail Drives. Awards 2012, Will Rogers Medallion Award in the Young Readers category for Texas Tales Illustrated: The Revolution. 2016, National Cowboy Museum Western Heritage Award in the Juvenile category for Texas Tales Illustrated: The Trail Drives. 2017, San Antonio Conservation Society Award in the Children's Book category for Texas Tales Illustrated: The Trail Drives.

She was named for William Moffett. Moffett was laid down 2 January 1934 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 11 December 1935; sponsored by Miss Beverly Moffett, daughter of Rear Admiral Moffett; and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts 28 August 1936, Commander Andrew H. Addoms in command. Moffett left Newport, Rhode Island, her base for Atlantic Fleet operations between 1936 and 1941, on 24 April 1941, joining the South Atlantic Neutrality Patrol off Brazil. After the fall of France, she operated out of Puerto Rico with a force guarding against hostile action by a Vichy-inclined admiral commanding the French West Indies fleet based at Martinique and Guadeloupe. She left her South Atlantic duty in August 1941 to protect Augusta, which was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Atlantic Charter Conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at NS Argentia, Newfoundland. For the first 2 years of World War II, Moffett operated with typical destroyer versatility on patrol and convoy duties in the South Atlantic and Caribbean, escort missions bringing her to U.S. ports from time to time. She made several voyages to West African parts in 1943. On 17 May 1943, as she and Jouett were on escort duty in the Caribbean, she learned that patrol planes had spotted and fired upon a German submarine. At 1246, Moffett sighted the German submarine U-128. The two destroyers sank the submarine with 5 inch gunfire, and then rescued 50 survivors including the German commanding officer. Three months later, while escorting Memphis and a merchant ship to Ascension Island, Moffett made contact with U-604, and again joined Navy aircraft to attack. A running fight ensued through the night, and when the submarine surfaced 95 miles north of Trinidad next morning, Moffett drove her down once more with five hits. Three days later, with the aid of aircraft, contact was regained and the submarine was badly damaged by Moffett's depth charges. In the dark and confusion of action, a friendly aircraft mistaking Moffett for the enemy made two strafing runs which caused minor damage. The stricken submarine was finally scuttled by her crew 11 August; Moffett was credited with the kill. On 26 March 1944, Moffett sailed as escort commander of Convoy YN-78, a group of tugs, barges, and patrol craft en route to England for the invasion of Normandy. After visiting Wales and Northern Ireland, Moffett returned to New York 11 May. Moffett's last combat experience came 1 August, when enemy planes attacked Convoy UGS-48 as she screened it en route to Bizerte, Tunisia. Laying smoke to protect the convoy, Moffett went into a series of brilliant tight turns and maneuvers to dodge the torpedo planes which continued to attack through the night, and with other escorts drove them off with antiaircraft fire. She returned to New York from this mission 27 August. After a last escort voyage to Oran in April 1945, Moffett began extended repairs at Boston. Towed to Charleston, South Carolina, 28 May for further repairs, Moffett was still in the yard at the close of the war in August, and work was stopped. She was decommissioned in Charleston 2 November 1945 and entered the Reserve Fleet. Stricken from the Navy list 28 January 1947, Moffett was sold for scrapping 16 May 1947 to Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland. Moffett received two battle stars for World War II service. No other United States Navy ship has been named Moffett.

For instance, Max Wertheimer did experiments with two stationary, flashing lights that at some interstimulus intervals appeared to the subject as moving instead of stationary. In these experiments, the interstimulus interval is simply the time between the two flashes. The ISI plays a large role in the phi phenomenon (Wertheimer) since the illusion of motion is directly due to the length of the interval between stimuli. When the ISI is shorter, for example between two flashing lines alternating back and forth, we perceive the change in stimuli to be movement. Wertheimer discovered that the space between the two lines is filled in by our brains and that the faster the lines alternate, the more likely we are to perceive it as one line moving back and forth. When the stimuli move fast enough, this creates the illusion of a moving picture like a movie or cartoon. Phi phenomenon is very similar to beta movement.Cummins, E. (n.d.). The Phi Phenomenon: Definition & Example. Retrieved May 03, 2016, from http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-phi-phenomenon-definition-lesson.html As it applies to classical conditioning, the term interstimulus interval is used to represent the gap of time between the start of the neutral or conditioned stimulus and the start of the unconditioned stimulus. An example would be the case of Pavlov's dog, where the time between the unconditioned stimulus, the food, and the conditioned stimulus, the bell, is considered the ISI. More particularly, ISI is often used in eyeblink conditioning (a widely studied type of classical conditioning involving puffs of air blown into the subject's eyes) where the ISI can effect learning based on the size of the time gap. What is of interest in this particular type of classical conditioning is that when the subject is conditioned to blink after the conditioned stimulus (tone), the blink will take place within the time period between the tone and the air puff, making the subject's eyes close before the puff can reach the eyes, protecting them from the air. The timing between the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is important. There are two types of approaches for eye blink conditioning when it comes to timing between the stimuli. The first is called delay conditioning, which is when the conditioned stimulus (tone) starts, then continues until the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) is released after a delay, then they both suspend at the same time. The other is called trace conditioning, where the conditioned stimulus (tone) is shorter and stops before the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) begins, leaving a gap between the two stimuli. This type of conditioning forces the subject, in this particular example, a bunny, to remember to link the conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus. The distinction between the two types of conditioning is of importance because the difference in the interstimulus interval (ISI) can have major effects on learning. For example, it has been shown that the length of the ISI, as well as the variability, changes habituation in subjects.Davis, M. (1970). Effects of interstimulus interval length and variability on startle-response habituation in the rat. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 72(2), 177-192. doi:10.1037/h0029472 When ISI is short and constant, habituation will happen more rapidly. The changes in the gap of time can be minuscule, from tens of milliseconds to several seconds long, and the effects it will have will still be important.Buonomano, D. V., Bramen, J., & Khodadadifar, M. (2009). Influence of the interstimulus interval on temporal processing and learning: Testing the state-dependent network model.

The document came to be known as Batman's Treaty and is considered significant as it was the first and only documented time when Europeans negotiated their presence and occupation of Aboriginal lands directly with the traditional owners.Richard Broome, pp10-14, Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800, Allen & Unwin, 2005, , The so-called treaty was implicitly declared void on 26 August 1835 by the Governor of New South Wales, Richard Bourke. Making of the treaty In January 1827, John Batman and Joseph Gellibrand applied for a grant of land at Port Phillip,Joseph Gellibrand \\"Australian Dictionary of Biography\\" which was at the time part of the colony of New South Wales. The petitioners stated that they were prepared to bring with them sheep and cattle to the value of £4000 to £5000. The application was refused, as inconsistent with the Nineteen Counties Order. By 1835, Batman prepared to sail to Port Phillip to explore the area. Gellibrand, a lawyer, prepared a draft deed for Batman to take on his trip, in case he found an opportunity to use it. The deed was for a transfer of an interest in land and provided for the payment of an annual tribute. On 10 May 1835 Batman sailed the 23-ton schooner Rebecca from Launceston for the mainland. The expedition included master Harwood, mate Robert Robson, three seamen, seven Aboriginal men from Parramatta, outside Sydney, New South Wales and three other white men, James Gumm, William Todd and Alexander Thomson. The party finally sailed into Port Phillip on 29 May 1835 after being delayed by bad weather. On hearing a native dog howling, they landed at Indented Head to investigate. After letting his own dogs play with the native dog, they drove it into the sea and shot it. Over the next week, they explored the area around the Bay, first at Corio Bay, near the present site of Geelong, and later moving up the Yarra and Maribyrnong rivers at the north of the Bay. Batman's party met with Aboriginal people several times, presenting gifts of blankets, handkerchiefs, sugar, apples and other items, and receiving gifts of woven baskets and spears in exchange. On 6 June, Batman met with eight elders of the Wurundjeri, including ngurungaetas Bebejan and three brothers with the same name, Jika Jika or Billibellary, the traditional owners of the lands around the Yarra River. For 600,000 acres of Melbourne, including most of the land now within the suburban area, Batman paid 40 pairs of blankets, 42 tomahawks, 130 knives, 62 pairs of scissors, 40 looking glasses, 250 handkerchiefs, 18 shirts, 4 flannel jackets, 4 suits of clothes and 150 lb. of flour. Location of treaty signing The meeting with the Aboriginal Elders took place on the bank of a small stream, which Batman described in his diary as a \\"lovely stream of water\\". Although the precise waterway and location is not given, 20th century historians suspect a likely location to have been Merri Creek, in what is currently Northcote. Alternative locations have been suggested on the Plenty River near Greensborough,James A. Blackburn The locality of Batman's treaty with the Port Phillip natives published by Robert Barr, 1886 Edgars Creek,J Stuart Duncan, John Batman's Walkabout Victorian Historical Journal lvii 1986 and on Darebin Creek.Alistair Campbell, John Batman and the Aborigines Malmsbury [Vic.] : Kibble Books 1987 These were generally based on analysis of the description of the journey given in the diary. However, there have been some suggestions that the critical period in the diaries was manipulated to allow for a larger tract of country to be obtained.Harcourt, Rex (2001), Southern Invasion. Northern Conquest. Story of the Founding of Melbourne, Golden Point Press, Blackburn South. Harcourt identifies the treaty signing location as \\"West Bend\\", a bend in the Merri Creek at the western end of Cunningham Street, Northcote and opposite Rushall Station. . He relies on a range of evidence including oral traditions, the description of the signing location in John Pascoe Fawkner's accounts, previous commemorative markers and ceremonies, interpretation of landmarks in contemporary descriptions, and later depictions such as Burtt's painting of the event,Batman's treaty with the aborigines at Merri Creek, 6 June 1835 [art original] / John Wesley Burtt which may have been prepared following discussions with participants in Batman's expedition.

Here Batman showed John Helder Wedge where he had explored and, from these details, Wedge prepared the first map of Melbourne (published in 1836), showing the location Batman had chosen as the site for the \\"village\\" and the division of land between association members. Several days after his return Batman wrote to the Governor of Tasmania, George Arthur, informing him of the treaty and of the Association's plans to run 20,000 sheep on the lands purchased. According to Batman's petition to George Arthur, Batman and Wedge would proceed immediately to the district with stock and only married servants (with their wives) would be allowed to accompany them. Arthur was not pleased with the Association's actions and wrote to the Governor of New South Wales, Richard Bourke. Wedge left Launceston on 7 August 1835, to set up a settlement on the Association's new lands. After stopping at the Barwon River, Wedge moved on to the Yarra River, where he encountered a party sent by John Pascoe Fawkner. (Fawkner himself arrived only in October.) Wedge told Fawkner of the treaty, but Fawkner would not leave, dismissing the treaty as worthless. Disputes over the treaty On 26 August 1835, Governor Bourke issued a Proclamation which formally declared that agreements such as Batman's Treaty were \\"void and of no effect as against the rights of the Crown\\" and declared any person on \\"vacant land of the Crown\\" without authorisation from the Crown to be trespassing. The proclamation was approved by the Colonial Office on 10 October 1835. The official objection to the treaty was that Batman had attempted to negotiate directly with the Aboriginal people, whom the British did not recognise as having any claim to any lands in Australia. Also, Batman had purchased the lands for the Association, and not for the Crown. The validity of the treaty has been widely disputed. It is possible that the marks which Batman claimed were the signatures of the eight Wurundjeri elders were instead made by one of the five Aboriginal men he had brought with him from Parramatta, since they resemble marks commonly used by Aboriginal people from that area. Furthermore, since neither Batman, the Sydney Aboriginal men or the Wurundjeri men spoke anything approaching the same language, it is almost certain that the elders did not understand the treaty, instead probably perceiving it as part of the series of gift exchanges which had taken place over the previous few days amounting to a tanderrum ceremony which allows temporary access to and use of the land.Kenny, Robert. 2008. Tricks or treats?A case for Kulin knowing in Batman’s treaty. History Australia 5 (2): pp. 38.1 to 38.14. DOI: 0.2104/ha080038.38.14 In any case, the European system of understanding property was entirely alien to almost all Aboriginal peoples. Nevertheless, the treaty has been praised as the only documented attempt to reach an agreement for land use between white colonists and the local Aboriginal people. The treaty is significant more broadly as it is the first and only documented time when Europeans in Australia have negotiated their presence with Aboriginals. Batman maintained until his death in 1839 that the treaty was valid. Some historians continued to assume that the treaty was a forgery, but the recollections of the Aboriginal elder Barak, who was present at the signing of the treaty as a boy, established that Batman, with the aid of New South Wales Aboriginal peoples, did in fact participate in a signing ceremony. All the same, although the document has come to be known as \\"Batman's Treaty\\", it does not classify itself and its key terminology is of private rather than of public law: \\"Do for ourselves our Heirs and Successors Give Grant Enfeoff and confirm unto the said John Batman his heirs and assigns\\". It isor, more exactly, is the deed which recordswhat later came to be termed a \\"private treaty\\", a sale between private parties on negotiated terms.\\"a sale of property on terms determined by conference of the seller and buyer\\" (Merriam- Webster Dictionary, \\"private treaty\\", recording that the expression is first found in 1858).

He was also a poet and essayist.  Biography  He was born in Cuba and studied in the United States and Spain. Bayo's most significant action during the Spanish Civil War was his invasion and retreat from the islands of Ibiza and Majorca.  Activities  In his youth he joined the Spanish Military Aviation. He had his first flight in 1916. He was expelled from the Aviation after taking part in a duel. He was then forced to join the Spanish Legion in 1924, and participated in the Moroccan War, which he stayed for two years as a company commander. In 1925 he was seriously wounded in the groin, spending a year in recovery. In 1926 he requested to return to Africa, and was assigned the 3rd battalion of the Mehal-la de Gómara - which was part of General Capaz's troops - taking part in heavy fighting until 1927. He returned to the air force during the Second Spanish Republic and was stationed in administrative posts, but he was not promoted. He was appointed as the 2nd Chief of Staff of the V Army Corps for the Battle of Brunete, Modesto, but the commander of the unit opposed this and Bayo was relieved. After that war was lost, Bayo had a furniture factory in Mexico, and is reported to have been an instructor at the Military Academy of Guadalajara. Bayo had contact in Mexico with prominent Latin American revolutionaries, and was associate/mentor of some, including Ernesto Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.

A number of small reflective markers are placed on the thoraco-abdominal surface by hypoallergenic adhesive tape. A system for human motion analysis measures the three-dimensional coordinates of these markers and the enclosed volume is computed by connecting the points to form triangles. From OEP it is thus possible to obtain volume variations of the entire chest wall and its different compartments. The chest wall can be modeled as being composed of three different compartments: pulmonary rib cage (RCp), abdominal rib cage (RCa), and the abdomen (AB). This model is the most appropriate for the study of chest wall kinematics in the majority of conditions, including exercise. It takes into consideration the fact that the lung- and diaphragm-apposed parts of the rib cage (RCp and RCa, respectively) are exposed to substantially different pressures on their inner surface during inspiration, that the diaphragm acts directly only on RCa, and that non-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles act largely on RCp. Abdominal volume change is defined as the volume swept by the abdominal wall. Optoelectronic plethysmography can be used following different measurement protocols, specifically developed for different applications and different experimental and clinical situations. In the arrangement designed for the analysis in sitting and standing positions, 89 markers are arranged on the thoraco-abdominal surface.Optoelectronic plethysmography can be used also in supine and prone positions.OEP was used to study chest wall kinematics in healthy subjects during exercise, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, patients with neuromuscular disorders and in Intensive Care Unit. The validation of the method was obtained by comparing the lung volume changes obtained by Volumetric and Flow measuring Spirometers and chest wall total volumes by optoelectronic plethysmography during different maneuvers.  History  This method has been developed at the Bioengineering Department of the Politecnico di Milano university by Andrea Aliverti and collaborators.

She served as a commissioned ship for 25 years and 9 months. Tolland was laid down as a Type C2-S-AJ3 ship under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1700) on 17 October 1944 by the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company in Wilmington, North Carolina and launched on 12 December 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Rex Freeman. She was delivered to the Navy on 23 December 1944 to be completed as a Navy attack cargo ship at the Todd Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York. She was commissioned at Brooklyn on 23 June 1945 with the hull code AKA-107, Captain F. B. Eggers commanding. Service history1945-1949= Based at the Amphibious Naval Base, Little Creek, Virginia, the Vermilion was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and spent over a year in shakedown and refresher training. In November 1946, she cruised to South American waters before assuming duty upon her return to Norfolk. For the next three years she took on standard Atlantic fleet operations, including midshipman training cruises, amphibious exercises, type training and reserve training cruises. She was then decommissioned on 26 August 1949 and berthed with the Reserve Fleet Group at Orange, Texas. =1950-1959= The outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950 meant the Vermilion was recommissioned at Orange on 16 October 1950, Captain A. Jackson in command. However, though the war had prompted her return to active duty, she never saw service in the Far East. Instead, she was used to replace other Atlantic Fleet ships released for duty. In the summer of 1951 the Vermilion took part in Operation Blue Jay, the first large-scale seaborne supply lift to the new airbase under construction at Thule, Greenland. She returned to Little Creek on 29 August 1951 and resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet, before visiting Thule on a second supply mission during the summer of 1952. By 25 August she had once again returned to Little Creek and resumed Atlantic Fleet duty. During the winter she operated in the West Indies out of the base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba before returning to Little Creek and Atlantic Fleet duty on 2 February 1953. For the next five years, Vermilion participated in Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises at Onslow Beach, North Carolina and in the Caribbean. She also conducted independent ship's exercises and made cruises the length of the Atlantic seaboard. She spent the second half of 1958 deployed in the Mediterranean Sea, returning to Little Creek and Atlantic Fleet duties in December. =1960-1971= Her routine of amphibious exercises and independent ship's exercises continued until the fall of 1962 when she was deployed to the West Indies to support the American quarantine of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. She then returned to Little Creek and her routine operations before deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean beginning May 1963. Vermilion returned to Little Creek on 17 October and began another four-year stint of operations along the Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean. In January 1968 she departed Morehead City, North Carolina, accompanied by Marine Air Control Squadron 6, bound for the Ryukyus via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor. She arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa on 22 February 1968 and departed three days later with Marine Air Control Squadron 8 embarked. The air squadron disembarked at Morehead City on 30 March before the Vermilion reached Norfolk the following day. Following a six-month overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard – during which she was redesignated LKA-107 – Vermilion resumed Atlantic Fleet operations in November, continuing to operate out of Norfolk for over three years. =Decommissioning= She was once again decommissioned on 13 April 1971 and then transferred to the Maritime Administration on 27 July 1971 to be laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 January 1977. On 19 February 1988 Vermilion was transferred to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and on 24 August 1988 she was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean 40 nautical miles (46 miles; 74 km) off Georgetown, South Carolina, to form an artificial reef.navsource.org USS Vermilion (LKA-107) ex SS Vermilion (AKA-107) (1944 - 1969)  References  * External links * * Military.com: USS Vermilion * 51 Years of AKAs Category:Tolland-class attack cargo ships Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the Carolina coast Category:Ships built in Wilmington, North Carolina Category:1944 ships Category:Ships sunk as artificial reefs Category:Maritime incidents in 1988 ","title":"USS Vermilion (AKA-107)"},{"id":"2768537","text":"La Ferté is a French toponym meaning a fortress or bastion, derived from Gallo-Roman firmitate, ultimately from Latin firmus, meaning 'stable or strong.'

It is a sequel to the hit 1985 film, Police Story, continuing the storyline of Chan's character, \\"Kevin\\" Chan Ka-kui. It is also marks the last appearance in the series for Lam Kwok-Hung as Superintendent Raymond Li, Chor Yuen as Chu Tao and Charlie Cho as John Ko. Plot Inspector Chan Ka-kui has been demoted to highway patrol as the result of his handling of his previous case, which involved the violent arrest of crime lord Chu Tao and heavy property damage. The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her. However, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he has been released from prison, and while he is still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui. John Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka-Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her aunt are beaten by John Ko and his men. Ka-Kui can no longer hold back, and he lashes out against John Ko and his men at a restaurant. Ashamed of his behavior, Ka-Kui resigns from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. He plans to take a trip to Bali with May, but while he is at a travel agency in a shopping mall, some police officers see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat. Unable to resist the urge to get involved in police work, Ka-Kui tells the officers to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared, and agrees to take responsibility for the decision. A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast. Ka-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try to learn more about the bombers. This leads to a suspect who is a deaf-mute and is a fierce martial artist and explosives expert. The bombing gang, aware that the police are on to them, plan a simultaneous bombing of the property company and the police headquarters. They double their ransom demand to $20 million and kidnap May, luring Ka-Kui into a trap in which he is strapped with an explosive vest and forced to pick up the extortion money from the property company. However, after picking up the money, Ka-Kui tells the gang that they are being followed and split up. Ka- kui, still holding the ransom, is able to drive his car into a tunnel so that the bomb he is wearing cannot be activated and he strips it off. He then goes to rescue May, who is being held in a warehouse full of fireworks. Ka-Kui again faces the deaf-mute man, who throws small firebombs at him. Ka-Kui then gains the upper hand and brutally retaliates against the mute man, finally throwing him off a third story catwalk onto a pile of plastic drums below. Ka- Kui then rescues May and departs the warehouse, just as it explodes in a huge ball of fire. Cast *Jackie Chan as Sergeant \\"Kevin\\" Chan Ka-kui a.k.a.

Reception The film received a rating of 86% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"a fine introduction to the Jackie Chan phenomenon\\" that is less emotionally charged than the first film and less outlandish than the sequel. TV Guide rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that the film makes up for its lack of story and eye-opening stunts with better pacing and more action. They concluded that this film \\"remains among Chan's best\\". In a review of the Shout! Factory double-bill, Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"This isn't so much exemplary filmmaking as it is bravura stunt work, but Police Story is a veritable case study in the value of the latter.\\" On reviewing the Police Story series, Kim Newman wrote in Sight & Sound that \\"a rare instance of a sequel that takes criticism of the original into account, but not to the benefit of the series\\" as Chan \\"actually does tone down the destruction, making for an oddly action-light action movie with the amiable Chan out of his depth as the story tries to turn serious.\\" In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.

Early life and education Jansen was born to a musical family. Her father Jan Jansen (nl) plays organ, harpsichord and piano; from 1987 to mid-2011 he was the organist of St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht, and was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Her mother was a classical singer; her brother David (nl) is a harpsichordist and organist; her brother Maarten is a cellist; and her uncle is the bass singer Peter Kooy. She began to study the violin at age 6, and has studied with Coosje Wijzenbeek, Philippe Hirschhorn, and Boris Belkin. She is married to Swedish conductor Daniel Blendulf and lives in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Career She appeared as soloist with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland in 2001, where she performed the Brahms Violin Concerto. She opened the BBC Proms in 2005. She has eschewed tradition by recording with only five solo strings rather than an orchestra, including her brother as cellist and father playing continuo. In live concerts, she has received standing ovations from enthusiastic audiences, for example at the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra 2006 concert at Berlin's Waldbühne, with a full attendance of 25,000, and in Los Angeles at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in 2008 to a sold-out audience. Jansen has performed on the 1727 Stradivari \\"Barrere\\" violin, which was on loan from the Stradivari Society of Chicago, also the 1727 Stradivari \\"Baron Deurbroucq\\", which is owned by the Beare's International Violin Society.Janine Jansen . Retrieved 2015-06-10. As of September 2016, Jansen is in possession for 10 years of the 1707 Antonio Stradivari ‘Rivaz, Baron Gutmann’, which is owned by the Norwegian national bank's subsidiary: Dextra Musica. She has begun her own chamber music festival in Utrecht. She has been a member of Spectrum Concerts Berlin since 1998. She received the Dutch Music Prize in 2003, and the distinguished Royal Philharmonic Society Instrumentalist Award in Britain in 2009. Jansen was a Radio 3 New Generation Artist from 2002–2004. She and her ex-boyfriend, the violinist Julian Rachlin, have collaborated in chamber music performances. In January 2018, Jansen performed Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 and Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 1 under Daniele Gatti's baton. In February of the same year, Jansen performed with Mischa Maisky, Martha Argerich and Barbican Conservatory at the Barbican Centre. In December 2018, Jansen performed with Valery Gergiev and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. For her performance with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra between 1997 and 2018, Jansen became a recipient of the Johannes Vermeer Award, which was awarded to her by the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Ingrid van Engelshoven. Recordings As of January 2006, she had recorded two mainstream CDs (one also a hybrid SACD). The first is a collection of encore pieces, conducted by Barry Wordsworth, the second a chamber ensemble rendition of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. In particular, her Vivaldi recording has seen great success in terms of download sales. In October 2006, she released her third album. This CD features the Mendelssohn and Bruch Violin Concertos, along with the Bruch Romance for Viola, with conductor Riccardo Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In 2007, she released her fourth album, Bach: Inventions & Partita. In 2008, she recorded a live session for the iTunes music store consisting of Bach's \\"Trio Sonata in G Major\\" and \\"Sonata for Violin and Harpsichord No. 6 In G Major\\". In 2009, Jansen released her recording of the Beethoven and Britten Violin Concertos. The Beethoven was recorded with Die Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, and the Britten with the London Symphony Orchestra. Both orchestras were conducted by Paavo Järvi. Jansen said that recording these concertos together was a long-standing desire of hers, as she sees these two works as among the greatest concertos in the current repertoire. On 29 December 2010, Jansen played with Mischa Maisky and Hannes Minnaar Antonín Dvořák's Piano Trio in e minor, op.90 'Dumky' at the Internationaal Kamermuziekfestival Utrecht, Vredenburg. Jansen has been a member of the chamber music series Spectrum Concerts Berlin since 1998. Various CDs with Spectrum have been released on the NAXOS label: Ernő Dohnányi - Serenade for String Trio and the Sextet (Nr. 8.557153) Robert Helps - Piano Quartet, Postlude and Nocturne (Nr. 8.559199) John Harbison - Four Songs of Solitude, Variations and Twilight Music (Nr. 8.559173). In 2010, she recorded her first recital for violin and piano with Itamar Golan, issued by Decca the next year. She chose a French repertoire, exposing her wonderful sophisticated sound. In addition to Debussy's and Ravel's sonatas for violin and piano and other pieces from the French 20th century, she recorded some pieces by Richard Dubugon, who composed them for Jansen. In 2012, Jansen recorded an album dedicated to Prokofiev, combining chamber music and concert music. With the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vladmir Jurowski, she played Prokofiev's concerto for violin and orchestra n. 2; with her colleague Boris Brovtsyn, she played the sonata for two violins in C major; finally, with Itamar Golan at piano, Jansen recorded the violin sonata in F minor. Jansen also recorded an album of chamber music with the violinist Boris Brovtsyn, the violists Amihai Grosz and Maxim Rysanov, the cellists Torleif Thedéen and Jens Peter Maintz. The album contains Verklärte Nacht by Schoenberg in its original version, for string sextet, and the string quintet in C major by Schubert. The album was issued by Decca on 1 April 2013. In June 2013, Jansen recorded her second album completely dedicated to Bach. She recorded Bach's concertos for violin in A minor and in E major with a small ensemble with players chosen by herself (strings: Boris Brovtsyn, Cindy Albracht, Fredrik Paulsson, Julia-Maria Kretz, Tijmen Huisingh, Monika Urbonaite, Nimrod Guez, Pauline Sachse, Maarten Jansen, Rick Stotijn; harpsichord: Jan Jansen) and the concerto for violin and oboe with the soloist Ramón Ortega Quero.

History Ceneca Communications Inc. developed the original PageMill and SiteMill products. During open beta testing, Adobe acquired the company and rebranded the product with their own logo. Adobe released PageMill 1.0 in late 1995. Adobe began shipping PageMill for the Macintosh priced at $99. It was considered revolutionary at the time, as it was the first HTML editor that was considered user-friendly, cited as the \\"PageMaker of the WWW\\". This first version, however, was also criticized for lacking items such as a spell- checker and support for creating HTML tables. Adobe acquired Ceneca in 1996. Adobe PageMill 2.0, which was introduced in early 1997, corrected these issues with a package that, according to one review, \\"adds more features than I have fingers and toes… PageMill with its tables, frames, graphics, and support for form interfaces, makes it easy to lay out a page\\". Adobe PageMill 3.0, released in early 1999, supported embedded font commands and a site-management feature. It was discontinued in February 2000, due to the acquisition and promotion of Adobe GoLive.

The rules vary to a great extent between the countries. Also the name of bank codes varies. In some countries the bank codes can be viewed over the internet, but mostly in the local language. The (national) bank codes differ from the international Bank Identifier Code (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code). Those countries which use International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) have mostly integrated the bank code into the prefix of specifying IBAN account numbers. The bank codes also differ from the Bank card code (CSC). The term \\"bank code\\" is sometimes (inappropriately) used by merchants to refer to the Card Security Code printed on a credit card.  Europe  * Belgium has a national system with account numbers of 12 digits. There are no separate bank codes. The first 3 digits of the account number are called the protocol number, and indicate the bank the account belongs to. * Czech Republic and Slovakia have 4-digit bank codes, used behind account number (domestic account number is XXXXXX-YYYYYYYYYY/CCCC, where CCCC is bank code). A bank branch can be identified from the bank code. * Denmark has 4-digit bank code (called Registreringsnummer, or Reg. nr.). * France has a 10 digit code, the first 5 digits contain the clearing identifier of the banking company (Code Banque), followed by the 5-digit branch code (Code Guichet). Both numbers are only used as a combined prefix for the nationwide full account number. * Germany has an 8-digit routing code. The first 4 digits identify the banking company and the latter 4 digits are assigned to the branch. In the 4-digit bank identifier: ** the first digit corresponds to one of 8 clearing regions of Germany, ** the first 3 digits (clearing region identifier and the next 2 digits after it) identify a \\"banking location\\" (Bankplatz), ** the last digit (4th in the whole routing code) denotes a banking company's classification (Bankengruppe). :For bank classification values and identifiers for German clearing regions, see Bankleitzahl (in German). :For a comprehensive list of Germany's \\"banking location\\" identifiers, see Bankplätze (in German). * Greece has a 7-digit Ηellenic Bank Identification Code (HEBIC), where the first 3 digits are the bank code and the last 4 the branch code. * Ireland uses a 6-digit sort code followed by an 8-digit account number similar to and partially integrated with the UK system. :The first two digits of the sort code identify the bank (90-xx-xx = [Bank of Ireland], 98-xx-xx = [Ulster Bank], for example) and the last 4 identify the branch. :There is an exception with 99-xx-xx - these codes are used for international banks Irish Clearing ACs, and some Post Office accounts. * Italy has a similar clearing system is used with 5 digits identifying the banking company (Codice ABI), followed by a 5-digit CAB (Codice di Avviamento Bancario) identifying the branch, followed by the account number. * The Netherlands has a national system with account numbers of 9 or 10 digits. There are no separate bank codes. The first 5 digits of the account number can be used to identify the bank (originally also the branch, but clients can now often keep their account number when they move to another branch). * Spain also has a similar format, with the first 4 digits identifying the banking company, the next 4 identifying the branch, the next 2 being the checksum, followed by the 10-digit account number. * Switzerland has a 3 to 5 digit bank code (Bankenclearing-Nummer); the first digit indicates the bank's classification group. Following after the bank code, a 4-digit number branch code identifier. For a list of Swiss bank codes, see Bank clearing number. * Sweden has 4 digit bank codes (clearingnummer), with an extra check digit for Swedbank. The first one or two digits are the bank group, and the rest the branch. For a list of Swedish bank codes, see lista över clearingnummer till svenska banker (in Swedish). * Ukraine has 6 digit bank codes. Account number does not include bank code. List of bank codes is available at the site of the National Bank of Ukraine.National Bank of Ukraine (in Ukrainian) * The UK has a 6-digit sort code. For prefixes identifying UK banking companies, see the list of sort codes of the United Kingdom. * Russia has 9 digit bank code (БИК код). As of February 2014 all countries in the Single Euro Payments Area have switched to an IBAN-based system for clearing (including TARGET2 for cross-border transfers). The national bank codes have been integrated into the IBAN definition, in most cases at the start of the new account number (starting at position 5 after the common prefix of two- letter country identifier and two check digits). This is valid for transfers in the euro currency. Countries which retain their own currency use their own system for transfers in their currency.  North America  * United States - The American Bankers Association since 1910 has used a 9-digit routing transit number to identify American banks, which are used in the automated processing of checks. The bank company is identified in the 5th to 8th digits (the 4 digits before the last checksum digit). The company number assigned to a bank includes a regional prefix indicating the metropolitan area and/or state. *Canada uses codes called routing numbers. They consist of 5 digits identifying the branch and the 3 digits identifying the financial institution.  South America  * Venezuela - The Central Bank of Venezuela, since 2001, has used a 20-digit to identify venezuelan banks. The bank company is identified in first four digits followed by four digits for agency, two digits for checksum and last ten digits for bank account. * Argentina - In this country each bank account is identified by the CBU (Clave Bancaria Uniforme).It is a 22-digit code build up as follows: 3 digits for the Bank Code, 4 digits for the Agency, 1 check digit and 13 digit for the bank account.  Asia-Pacific  * Australia has a 6-digit Bank State Branch (BSB) code which precedes the account number. The first 2 or 3 digits indicate the financial institution and the other 3 or 4 digits are the branch codes assigned by the institution. * New Zealand has a 6-digit prefix identical to Australia's BSB code, and although they appear similar (e.g. ANZ bank accounts in both countries start with 01, Westpac with 03), they are not compatible. The first 2 digits indicate the bank and the next 4 digits indicate the branch. All digits, along with the seven-digit account number and two or three digit suffix, are required for all wire transfers regardless of whether the transfer is intra-bank or interbank. * India has an 11-digit alpha numeric Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). The first 4 characters indicate the financial institution, the fifth digit is 0 and the other 6 digits indicate the branch. In between space you just enter 0 in it to complete. * Iraq has a 1 to 3 digit bank code which identifies the bank branch. * Indonesia It is used for clearing/kliring transactions such as checks, giros, etc. PayPal uses this domestic clearing code to transfer money from the PayPal accounts of Indonesian users to their Indonesian bank accounts in Rupiah. The first three digits of the bank code are also used for inter-bank transfers using an ATM. * Since 2010, South Korea uses a 7-digit code starting with 0 or 2. The first 3 digits, called the bank code, is required for interbank wire transfers. The last 4 digits are a branch code, which is rarely used.

It was established in 1933 and is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury. It is one of four Roman Catholic secondary schools in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, and one of three Irish Christian Brothers schools in the Merseyside area. Admissions Founded in 1933, the school was in recent years granted Technology College and then Academy status, in cooperation with Upton Hall School, the local Catholic girls' school. The school used its specialist school status as an opportunity to improve some teaching facilities and broaden aspects of the curriculum.  History Foundation= The school was founded in 1933 by the trustees of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, at the invitation of Hugh Singleton, Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury. In 1946 it became a direct grant grammar school and continued as such until 1975, when the trustees opted for the school to be independent in order to continue as a single-sex =Grant-maintained status= The Education Act 1993 gave the trustees the chance to re-enter the maintained sector and so, once again, offer parents the choice of a Catholic Grammar School education for their sons, irrespective of their ability to pay. In 1995, the school became one of the first Independent schools to re-enter the maintained sector. The prep department retained its independent status and is now known as Redcourt St Anselm's. The two schools still maintain links and Redcourt is one of the College's main feeder schools. In September 1999, the school became voluntary aided in line with the Education Act 1998. = Specialist School Status = After two unsuccessful applications, the school finally achieved joint Technology College status together with Upton Hall School, another local Catholic grammar, as part of the UK Specialist schools initiative. The school had, at the time, been unable to apply for specialist Language College status because, Wirral Grammar School for Girls, another school in the Wirral LEA had already applied for this as a first specialism. Upon achieving the status the school further developed its programme for A-level and GCSE in ICT, installed a wireless computer network in many areas of the school, increased the number of computer workstations available to students for academic work, and also made an email service and extranet available to all students and staff. In 2006 the joint Technology College designation expired, and the school announced its intention to make an application, independently from Upton Hall School to renew its status. The school also announced, because of the success of the programme, its intention to apply for a second specialism in Languages. Both applications were successful. In 2009 the college was invited to take up a third designation as a Leadership Partner School. = Academy = The school converted to academy status on 1 June 2011. =Links with the church= The teaching staff at this and other Christian Brothers schools have traditionally been avowed Christian Brothers, but over the decades, the responsibility for this provision has been passed down to what is now a full-time lay teaching staff of 44, maintaining strong links with the Edmund Rice Family and with the guidance of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury.  Ethos and mission  Education at the school is, at its core, Roman Catholic, and inspired by the work of Blessed Edmund Rice. It is fundamentally based on the Eight Essentials of Christian Brothers Education, and the religious studies programme at the school follows that prescribed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury. The study of the history and ethos of the college forms a part of the Religious Studies programme at Key Stage 3, and is a common focus for the weekly assemblies. (The Christian Brothers resident in the house that adjoins the college ensure that Sixth Form students are kept well informed about the ethos of the college by an annual programme of discourse which complements the PSHE programme. =Patron saint= Saint Anselm of Canterbury (1033 or 1034 – 21 April 1109).  Sports  The college has a reputation for sporting achievement far outstripping its size. Notable sporting achievements include winning the National Schools Cross Country Championship at Intermediate Level and winning the Northerns Schools Championship countless times, regularly attending the National Schools Athletics Final and travelling the country competing in various rugby union competitions. The school also partakes in Hockey and Cricket competitions.  Affiliations  The College had traditionally been affiliated with Redcourt - St Anselm's, a local independent primary school, and although now independent from the secondary school, both schools are part of the Edmund Rice Family, and share sports facilities in Noctorum. The joint- technology college status of the school with Upton Hall School until Autumn 2006 gave rise to increased cooperation between the two Catholic grammar schools on the Wirral Peninsula. Other joint activities include language talks and spiritual activities. Notable alumni and staff Alumni of the school are referred to as Old Anselmians, or within the school as Old Boys, reflecting the single-sex nature of the school. The alumni association of the college is the Anselmian Association. * Dave Balfe, keyboard player in various Liverpool bands especially The Teardrop Explodes and manager of Blur (band) * Harry Charsley, footballer with Everton FC * Peter Davenport, footballer with Manchester United FC, Middlesbrough FC, Sunderland AFC * Bob Fitzharris, Archdeacon of Doncaster from 2001 to 2011 * Christian Furr, UK artist who painted HRH * John Gorman (entertainer) in The Scaffold * Austin Healey, former English International rugby player (Leicester Tigers) * Ben Johnston, English International rugby player (England Saxons) * Prof Dennis Kavanagh, Professor of Politics from 1996 to 2006 at the University of Liverpool * Ross MacManus, UK musician; father of Elvis Costello * Chris Malkin, former footballer with Tranmere Rovers * Prof Paddy Nixon FBCS FRSA, Vice-Chancellor since 2015 of Ulster University * Sean O'Connor (producer), Executive Producer since 2016 of EastEnders, and former Editor of The Archers on BBC Radio 4 * Mark Palios, former Chief executive of The Football Association and owner of Tranmere Rovers F.C. * Chris Pilgrim, Newcastle Falcons rugby player * Prof Christopher J.
