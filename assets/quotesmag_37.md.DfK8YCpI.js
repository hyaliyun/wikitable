His name is engraved on the east side of the Arc de triomphe.  Life  He entered the French army as a private in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment on 24 March 1791, rising to sous-lieutenant on 10 May 1792 and ordnance officer for his regiment on the staff of the armée du Rhin. On 19 May 1793 he was made an aide de camp, took 7 boxes from the enemy and captured the colonel Johann von Klenau. He was attached to the general staff on 29 vendémiaire year II. On the night of 12-13 frimaire, having learned on a visit to the vanguard that the Austrian army defeated at Niederbronn was evacuating Haguenau, he marched on Haguenau with 50 dragoons, surprised the sentries guarding the gate, entered the city, stopped the enemy from looting it and took 400 prisoners. In recognition of that action he was made chief adjutant general of the battalion on the following 23 germinal. On 4 prairial, with two squadrons of chasseurs, he was commanded to capture the positions at Neunhoffen, then held by 1,500 Bavarians--he forced them to retire and took 200 prisoners. Promoted to adjudant-général colonel provisoire on 3 messidor the same year, he went to join the siege of Mainz where, on the night of 25-26 brumaire year III, he captured 600 men of the corps known as the Manteaux- Rouges, who were at Weisenau--this post was re-occupied on 26 brumaire and Bellavène surprised it the following night and captured 400 men. He was then confirmed as adjudant-général colonel on 25 prairial year III before taking part in the commission set up by general Moreau to plan a crossing of the Rhine. In prairial year IV this plan was presented to the general, who approved it, and it took place on 6 messidor. The same day Moreau, the commander-in-chief, made Bellavène a général de brigade. At the battle of Rastadt on 17 messidor, general Sainte-Suzanne's division found itself compromised. Bellavène went to support it with his demi-brigade of cavalry and was struck by a cannonball which took off a leg and knocked over his horse. On 22 messidor the French government confirmed his provisional promotion to général de brigade. He was then employed in the government's mapping office and on 5 pluviôse year V was given a command in the 3rd Military Division, which he held until 1 germinal year VII. He was made inspector of reviews on 8 pluviôse year VIII before being recalled to command the 4th Military Division during the congress of Lunéville. On 19 ventôse year XI, Bonaparte entrusted him with the command, organisation and direction of studies at the military academy at Saint-Cyr, as inspector of the Prytanée militaire ; he then made him, in year XII, a member of the Légion d'honneur on 19 frimaire and a Commander of the order on 25 prairial. He was then made a général de division on 4 October 1807, a baron de l'Empire in 1808 and inspector-general of military schools on 1 July 1812. On 8 July 1814 the restored king made him a Cross of the Order of Saint Louis, but on 2 August that year he was dismissed as inspector-general and on 1 January 1815 put on half pay. He was made inspector-general again by Napoleon during the Hundred Days and gave the government 4,000 francs to spend on equipment for the National Guard. The Dictionnaire des Généraux français relates of him: Louis XVIII, now back in Paris, allowed Bellavène to retire to Milly-la-Forêt on 27 September 1815, where Bellavène died in 1826.

The original version was created on 21 December 1937. It entered into force on 1 January 1942. Previously, criminal law had been a cantonal competency. History The Swiss Criminal Code was based on an initial draft by Carl Stooss in 1893. He proposed one of the first criminal codes that included both punishment and preemptive safeguard measures. The original code was approved by the people on 3 July 1938 in a referendum, with 358,438 voting in favor to 312,030 voting against. With its entry into force on 1 January 1942, all cantonal legislation that contradicted the new Criminal Code was abolished. This especially included the death penalty, which was still in force in some cantons. Moreover, the competences for substantive law was largely transferred from the cantons to the Confederation. The cantons retained only the competence in procedural law and cantonal tax legislation and violations. The code has been revised numerous times since 1942. The most recent significative revision took effect in 2007 and introduced the possibility to convert short prison sentences (less than one year) into fines, calculated using a day-rate based on the \\"personal and economic situation of the convict at the time of the verdict\\", with an upper limit set at CHF 3000 per day of the sentence. Practically all prison sentences shorter than one year have since been converted into fines, conditional sentences (parole) to conditional fines. This has caused controversy because the result is that lighter offences not punishable by imprisonment always result in unconditional fines, while more severe offences now often result in conditional fines that do not need to be paid at all. The Federal Council in October 2010 announced its intention to revert to the earlier system, and all large parties expressed at least partial support.

It was built in 1901 during British rule. Freemasonry was first introduced by the Dutch with the establishment of a masonic lodge, Fidelity Lodge, in Colombo in 1771 by the Grand Lodge of Holland, followed by a second lodge in Galle in 1773 and another lodge in Colombo in 1794. In 1795 the British took possession of all the Dutch settlements on the island and in 1801 Ceylon was formed as a separate Crown colony. On 9 February 1801 the officers of the 51st Regiment were issued a warrant by the Grand Lodge of Scotland to establish the Orange Lodge No. 274 in Colombo (it was dissolved in 1848), which was followed by No. 329 for the 6th Battalion in 1802 (dissolved in 1830) and No. 340 in September 1807 for the 34th Regiment of Foot but it is doubtful this lodge ever convened (dissolved November 1807). In 1822, the Taprobane Lodge was established in Ceylon under a provisional warrant from the United Grand Lodge of England, but was dissolved in June 1862. In the same year (1822), St. John's Lodge No. 628, was formed at Colombo by members of the St. Andrew's Union Lodge, which was attached to the 19th Regiment of Foot. It still exists as Lodge No. 434, but is located in the District of Madras. In August 1838, the oldest existing lodge in the country, St. John's Lodge of Colombo, No. 454, was formed. In 1861 the Grand Lodge of Ireland established its first masonic lodge in Ceylon, Sphinx Lodge No. 107 and on 9 October 1878 formed a provincial Grand Lodge of Ceylon, which went into abeyance in 1890. It was not until 1886, that the next English lodge was formed, the Lodge of St. George No. 470, which still exists in Colombo. Masonic meetings at that time were held at the De Soysa Building, in Slave Island. In 1897 a gathering of senior Freemasons proposed the construction of a temple building in commemoration of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee but construction was delayed to accommodate the land acquisition, preparation of plans and the raising of funds. After the necessary funding was raised by subscription and debentures, the cornerstone of the building was laid on 27 September 1900 by John Norman Campbell, a Freemason and a philanthropist, and the building was completed in August 1901 with a formal opening on 1 September 1901. The temple was designed by Edward Skinner, a Freemason and an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and built by the Colombo Commercial Company.Lodges in Sri Lanka The building was built in neo-Georgian style mixed with elements of Eastern architecture. The Ceylon Independent stated on 2 October 1901: On 1 May 1907 the six English masonic lodges were consolidated under the auspices of the District Grand Lodge of Sri Lanka. In 1914 it was resolved to construct a front porch with a room above on the northern side of the building however due to the outbreak of World War I the works were deferred. In 1928 the additions were built by Walker Sons and Company for Rs. 6,800. In 2002, Sri Lanka Post featured the Victoria Masonic Temple on its Rs. 4.50 stamp to commemorate the centenary anniversary of the temple. left References Category:Masonic buildings completed in 1901 Category:Buildings and structures in Colombo Category:Masonic buildings ","title":"Victoria Masonic Temple"},{"id":"29636694","title":"Møbelringen Cup 2010"},{"id":"29636697","text":"Nemom Railway Terminal also known as Thiruvananthapuram South Terminus, (Code:NEM) is one of the 5 railway stations serving the city of Trivandrum in the state of Kerala, India.The Hindu : Kerala / Thiruvananthapuram News : Thiruvananthapuram Central to be made a world-class station Nemom is in the Thiruvananthapuram Railway division of the Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways.

It was established by Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002R2195:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) and amended by European Commission Regulation (EU) No. 213/2008 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008R0213&qid;=1429986881823&from;=EN issued on 28 November 2007. Description CPV codification consists of a main vocabulary which defines the subject of the contract, and a supplementary vocabulary to add further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure made up with codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit). This combination of digits is associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services defining the subject of the contract. A Call for Tender is quite often described by more than one CPV Code, aiming to give a better and more detailed description of the object of the contract. Commercial organisations promoting public contracts to their members or readers generally use CPV codes to identify business sectors likely to be interested in specific tenders, along with NUTS Codes which indicate the country and region within which the contract is to be performed. Main Vocabulary classification structure The numerical code consists of 8 digits, subdivided into: Divisions: first two digits of the code XX000000-Y. Groups: first three digits of the code XXX00000-Y. Classes: first four digits of the code XXXX0000-Y. Categories: first five digits of the code XXXXX000-Y. Examples Some examples (taken from the 2008 amended version) are: 03113100-7 Sugar beet 03113200-8 Sugar cane 18451000-5 Buttons 18453000-9 Zip fasteners 71355000-1 Surveying services 71355200-3 Ordnance surveying Each of the last three digits of the code allows to provide a more precise description of the subject within each category. The ninth digit, the so- called \\"control digit\\", verifies the previous eight ones, avoiding any possible error in the assignation of codes to the subject of public procurement Supplementary Vocabulary Although the Supplementary Vocabulary is not always used, it can be added in certain cases to expand the description of the subject of a contract. It is made up of an alphanumeric code with a corresponding wording allowing further details to be added regarding the specific nature, purpose or context of the goods or services to be purchased: for example, specific metals may be designated e.g. AA08-2 (Tin) or AA09-5 (Zinc); food form may be designated e.g. BA04-1 (Fresh), BA06-7 (Hot) or BA24-1 (Frozen); and users or beneficiaries may be designated e.g. EA02-8 (for children) or EA07-3 (for pregnant women). The Supplementary Vocabulary was reconstructed and enriched in the 2008 revision. The alphanumeric code includes the following levels: * first level comprising a letter corresponding to a section; * second level comprising four digits: three to denote a subdivision and the last one for verification purposes.

O'Kelly (1915 – October 1982) was an Irish archaeologist who led the excavation and restoration of Newgrange, a major Late Stone Age passage tomb in the Boyne Valley, County Meath, Ireland, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Early life O'Kelly was born in Abbeyfeale, County Limerick in 1915. Although he was baptized Michael Joseph, and published as Michael J. or M.J., he was known to family and friends as Brian, the name his mother originally wanted, throughout his life. He entered University College, Cork (UCC) in 1934. He began fieldwork as an undergraduate in 1937. He worked as a surveyor in the excavation of the ring-fort at Garranes, County Cork with Seán P. Ó. Ríordáin, then Professor of Archaeology at UCC. Later that year he moved on to the Neolithic site of Lough Gur. After receiving his M.A. he was appointed curator of the new Cork Public Museum in Fitzgerald Park. In 1945 he married Claire, also an archaeologist, whom he had met as a student. Career In 1946 O'Kelly succeeded Professor Ó Ríordáin as head of the Archaeology Department at UCC, a position he held for 36 years. He led field work each summer, and from 1944 was published extensively in scholarly journals. =Newgrange= Newgrange, the site O'Kelly is most associated with, was originally accidentally discovered in 1699. It was in extremely poor condition in 1961, with no public access. That year the archaeologist Patrick Hartnett selected O'Kelly to direct excavations. Work continued every season through to 1975. On December 21, 1967 O'Kelly confirmed a local legend that the rays of the sun on the midwinter sunrise go straight through the tomb – passing through a small 'roof-box' opening above the doorway to penetrate along the whole length of the passage as far as the center of the chamber. O'Kelly speculated: \\"I think that the people who built Newgrange built not just a tomb but a house of the dead, a house in which the spirits of special people were going to live for a very long time. To ensure this, the builders took special precautions to make sure the tomb stayed completely dry, as it is to this day. …\\" O'Kelly and his wife also led work on other sites within the Boyne Valley complex.

Many people come to the shrine from Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh along with people from Odisha. The legend says Devi is worshipped from centuries whereas the temple is a new one. Every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday the temple draws a large crowd from nearby area. Dussehra in October and Chaitra parva is most famous in March–April. The nearest railhead is Rayagada. People who have unfulfilled wishes come here and stay for many days for worship. History According to the Odisha Gazetteer, “in the fourteenth century the Suryavanshi king Viswanath Dev Gajapati chose Rayagada as his capital and shifted his headquarters to that new town from Nandapur. He built an enormous fort at devotion of the entire Rayagada the ruins of which are still seen. Viswanath Gajapati also constructed rows of temples along the river Nagavali and the ruined temple called Majhi Ghariani is also attributed to the Goddess right in the middle of his palace and the temple was raised later at that very spot. Hence, the name Majhi Ghariani, or the one seated in the central room. The construction of the temple (The structure as we see today) is of very recent origin of around forty years. In the past days, the temple was located inside the fortress of Vishwanath.

In the fallowing engagement, he was credited with destroying two enemy fighters. When he returned to Akagi, he was immediately sent back in air to defend the IJN carriers against US Navy torpedo bombers. During the combat air patrol (CAP), he and his unit was credited with shooting down six enemy torpedo bombers. He landed on Hiryū after Akagi was hit by USN SBD Dauntless dive bombers. In the afternoon he took off from Hiryū to conduct CAP, but Hiryū too was hit he along with his unit commander Lieutenant Ayao Shirane were forced to ditch. They were picked up by a Japanese light cruiser. After the Battle of Midway, Petty Officer Ōmori was transferred to the carrier Shōkaku. In August 1942, he participated during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, where he was assigned to cover the strike force that attacked US carriers. The escort of nine Zeros was led by Lieutenant Yasuhiro Shigematsu. When they spotted the USN aircraft approaching IJN fleet, Ōmori along with four other Zeros broke away from the strike force to attack the enemy. However, one of his wingman, Petty Officer Third Class Sadamu Komachi, did not follow and stayed with Shigematsu. In October 1942, Petty Officer Ōmori participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands where he and his wingman Petty Officer Komachi conducted CAP. While defending the IJN carriers against SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Hornet, Ōmori was killed in aerial combat while attempting to ram the leading bomber. They managed to account for four enemy dive bombers during their approach. He was posthumously promoted to Ensign.

It was built by the Cleveland Grays, a private military company which was founded in 1837.Cleveland Grays, Cleveland Grays - The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. This is one of the oldest standing buildings in downtown Cleveland.  The Cleveland Grays  The Cleveland Grays is a social organization devoted to the promotion of patriotism and the preservation of the military heritage of Greater Cleveland. It was founded as a volunteer private military company at a time when the common or constitutional militia languished due to disinterest and neglect by state politicians. The unit's original purpose was twofold: to provide assistance and support to the local law enforcement authorities of the time as well as to provide a first line of defense for the city in the event that the fighting in Canada's Rebellions of 1837 spilled over the border and into the United States resulting in a third war with the United Kingdom in less than a century.Vourlojianis (2002), p. 14 The unit's motto is Semper Paratus (from the Latin: \\"Always Ready\\"). The first organizational meeting was held on August 28, 1837, and on September 18, seventy-eight men joined the active company. At the time of its founding, the unit was called The Cleveland City Guards but within the next year the membership decided that their organization would be known by reference to the gray color of their uniforms.Vourlojianis (2002), pp. 7-11 On November 29, 1838 the Grays made one of the first of their many parade appearances fully dressed in their distinctive gray uniforms and tall black bearskin caps. As the years passed, those who had earned the status of \\"Pioneer\\" for their membership of twenty- five or more years were entitled to add leather aprons to their uniforms and to carry axes when on parade. The Grays saw military service as a unit during the Civil War and the Spanish–American War. Reforms of the country's militia system which began with the Militia Act of 1903 and continued with subsequent legislation at the state and federal levels meant that the era of private military companies' official participation in national military affairs had come to an end and while the Grays, under the leadership of Ludwig S. Connelly, were able to enlist in the Ohio National Guard (ONG) for duty during the Mexican Punitive Expedition, they essentially did so as a group of private citizens enlisting en masse and not as a private military company. Their participation in World War I, which began immediately upon their ONG unit's release from duty on the Mexican border, was the last conflict in which the Grays saw active service even as a group of enlistees.Vourlojianis (2002), pp. 91-115 Individual members have served in subsequent conflicts. Building The Grays made their home in several different places from the time of their founding until the completion of their own building on Bolivar Road. The Grays' first armory was located on the fourth floor of the Mechanics Block, newly erected in 1838 at the southeast corner of Ontario Street and Prospect Street.Rose (1990), pp. 154, 165. In 1870, they moved into a building which had once served as a fire station on Frankfort Street.Rose (1990), p. 174. By March 20, 1880 the Grays had moved into the new City Armory on Long StreetRose (1990), p. 439. and used that facility as its headquarters along with the 5th Regiment, Ohio National Guard until December 8, 1892 when fire destroyed the building and much of its contents including equipment and guns belonging to the Grays. Major Otto Schade and several of his men were able to save a few items without any cost to their health or their lives. The unit was able to recover very quickly and funds were soon amassed for the purpose of building a new armory. Until construction was completed in 1893, the company found a temporary home at the Gatling Gun Battery Armory on Sibley Street.Rose (1990), p. 540. =After the fire= The armory's entrance On May 30, 1893. a three- ton Berea sandstone foundation block was put in place by Colonel John Frazee. The main portion of the building is four stories high, and the most notable feature is the five-story tower on the northeast corner of the building. The tower has '3 x 5' foundation blocks, the main entrance corners and the front window lintels are all of solid rough-hewn sandstone. The main entry arch rests on top of polished granite columns that rise from each cornerstone. Positioned above is a black iron drop-gate, and a gothic barrier between the front steps and the colossal oak doors. There were also pointed iron rods bolted to the scarlet brick walls that make up the window protectors on the first floor. The effect is a splendid mix of color and texture in materials. The overall design effectively conveys that this is an urban fortress. The Cleveland Grays Armory has been long known for hosting the city's premiere social events. Grays Armory earned repute as an exclusive venue right from the beginning during the celebrations for Cleveland's Centennial (1896). The Grays Armory events went way beyond the customary military balls and band concerts typical during that era. This building was originally built to house weapons and provides a drill hall for the militia; this edifice quickly evolved into a vital community center for the turn-of-the century Clevelanders. Cleveland Grays Armory Museum The Grays Armory Museum seeks to share its historical and cultural legacy with the public. Beyond stewardship of the building and conservation of artifacts, the museum strives to preserve the traditions and the rich heritage of those who serve their country and their community. The museum actively fulfills this objective by preserving, interpreting and presenting the military history of the United States. The museum regularly reaches out to Greater Cleveland by sponsoring open-house events intended to reach diverse audiences. Each Veterans Day, the museum presents a cultural and educational program honoring those who serve. In the past, programs that have included patriotic orchestra concerts and special touring exhibits. The Grays Armory can also be rented for special events such as private parties, weddings, receptions, and even proms. Organ In July, 1970 the 3 manual 17 rank pipe organ was installed. The organ originates from the Warner Theater in Erie, Pennsylvania. Three or four concerts per year are given on this organ, sponsored by the Western Reserve Theater Organ Society.

The fifteen domes of the mosque were once gilded, giving the mosque the name of Choto Shona Masjid (Small Golden Mosque).Chhota Sona Masjid. Gaur  By Bangladesh Channel. Bangladesh.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-22. The mosque is one of the best-preserved sultana monuments under protection by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Governments of Bangladesh. The gilding that gave the building its name does not exist anymore. The mosque premise, which covers an area of 42 m from east to west by 43.5 m from north to south, was originally surrounded by an outer wall (now restored) with a gateway in the middle of the east side. Plaque at the entrance with a short history of the mosque Design Choto Sona Mosque, view from outside Built of brick and stone, the mosque proper forms a rectangle having outside dimensions of from north to south and from east to west. All the four walls are veneered externally and to some extent also internally with granite stone blocks. These stones have disappeared from the southern side of the west wall because of conservation works after the destruction by the earthquake of 1897. The four exterior angles of the building are strengthened with polygonal towers, of which nine facets are visible. The cornices are curvilinear and have stone gutters to drain off the rain water from the roof. There are five arched doorways in the eastern facade and three each on the north and south walls. Corresponding to the five archways in the east wall there are five semi-circular mihrabs inside the west wall. The stones of most of these miharbs have disappeared. The interior of the mosque, measuring , is divided into three aisles by two rows of stone pillars, four in each row. A wide central nave has cut the aisles into halves, each half showing six equal square units with a side of 3.5 m. The nave has three rectangular units, each measuring 3.5 by 4.5 m. The interior of the mosque has therefore a total of fifteen units, of which the three rectangular units are covered with chauchala vaults, and the remaining twelve square units each by an inverted tumbler- shaped dome. They are all carried on radiating arches springing from the free- standing stone pillars and the engaged pilasters. The upper corners in between the arches of the square units are filled with corbelled brick pendentive to make up the phase of transition for the domes. At the northwest corner of the mosque there is a royal gallery forming an upper floor, which is still standing in a dilapidated condition. It was approached from the northwest corner of the mosque through a stepped platform connected with a doorway. The gallery has a mihrab in front. Stone carving, brick-setting, terracotta, gilding, and glazed tiles were used in decorating the building, and of them the former played the dominant role. The subject matters of the stone carving were chosen according to the demand of the spaces, e.g., the borders of the panels with creepers and their interior with various forms of stylised hanging patterns adapted from the chain-and-bell of the Bauddha and Jaina period. The spandrels of arches and the spaces above the frames are always dotted with rosettes, an attractive form of designs, but are all carved differently. The interior of the domes and vaults are decorated with terracottas, those of the vaults being copies of the bamboo frames of local huts. All the frontal archways and those of the mihrabs are cusped. Ornamentation Side view of Sona Mosjid The most important ornamentation of the mosque is to be seen on the frontal courtyard of the mosque, only recently excavated. The ornamentation consists of mosaic roundels in blue and white colours of variegated design. The mosaic design is not in situ, but a roundel has been composed by the excavators, putting the flakes in their appropriate places and exhibiting it in a room attached to the guesthouse nearby. At a distance of 14.5 m to the east of the gateway there is a stone platform containing two tomb sarcophagi inscribed with verses from the Quran and some names of God. It is unknown who is buried here. Cunningham suggests these are the tombs of Wali Muhammad, the builder of the mosque, and his father Ali. Current situation The glamour of the Chhoto Sona Masjid is not there as it was originally, particularly because of the stripping of the decorative mihrabs and the mosque courtyard, but the remains are nevertheless one of the most attractive monuments of Guar-Lakhnauti.

It is one of the Boulevards of the Marshals that circle the outer parts of the city.  Location  The Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix starts at the avenue de Malakoff and ends at the place du Maréchal-de-Lattre-de- Tassigny. It is long and wide.  History  A portion of the Thiers wall, the military structure and moat that later was replaced by the various Boulevards of the Marshals. The French war department had completed the Thiers wallincluding fortifications, a dry moat, a Rue Militaire and a large bermaround 1840. In 1859, the military engineering service gave conditional control to the Paris city council. The expansion of the land area of Paris in 1860, by annexing bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything without was not. The Thiers wall, with its accompanying berm and moat, led to a profound disruption and complication of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs. Paris city council started upgrading and conversion of some sections of the Rue Militaire into boulevards in 1861, with the (yet unnamed) Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix one of the first stretches to open. In 1864, the boulevard was named after Jean Lannes (1769–1809), Duke of Montebello, Prince of Siewierz and Marshal of France. Each section of the upgraded Rue Militaire was then named for a marshal of the First French Empire (1804–1814) who served under Napoleon, leading to the entire ring being collectively called the Boulevards of the Marshals. The Boulevards of the Marshals concept was almost fully realized by 1932, with the original 19 boulevards named for Lefebvre or one of his fellow First Empire marshals. In 1932, Paris chose to recognize the famed French Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix (1759–1805) by renaming a portion of Boulevard Lannes as Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix. Bruix, who was a Vice admiral and had resigned as Minister of the Navy in July 1799, was one of Napoleon's confidants during the planning of the November 1799 Coup of 18 Brumaire. After seizing power, Napoleon promoted Bruix to admiral, and later appointed him as Conseiller d'État. This is one of only three Boulevards of the Marshals which do not bear the name of a marshal of France. The final two sections of the Boulevards of the Marshals (named for 20th century generals and Martial Henri Valin), bringing the total to 22 and closing the ring, would not be completed until 2005.

The Russell Industrial Center is a , seven building complex, designed by Albert Kahn for John William Murray in 1915. It contains studios and lofts and serves as a professional center for commercial and creative arts. Murray Body Corporation supplier of bodies to Ford and the third largest auto-body company in the U.S. built the complex for its business in 1924. Murray soon diversified its business leaving the automotive industry in 1955. The complex has become another of Detroit's renovated buildings. In 2003 Dennis Kefallinos purchased it and converted it into more than one million square feet of studio space and lofts for various artists, creative professionals, and businesses. The Russell Industrial Center works with non profits, local colleges, and businesses. Kefallinos owns several Detroit businesses, such as Nikki's Pizza in Greektown. History John William Murray, born 1862, in Ann Arbor, Michigan formed the J W Murray Mfg. Co. in 1913 to supply sheet metal parts for the automobile factories in the Detroit area.Murray Corporation of America Coachbuilt.com. accessed May 20, 2018 The first plant was located in Detroit, at 1975 Clay Street, which is next to the Grand Trunk Western Railroad line and borders Fordyce, Morrow, Marston and Clay Streets. Murray Manufacturing began manufacturing automobile bodies, stamped fenders, hoods, cowls and frames. The growing demands from customers, such as the Dodge brothers, Ford Lincoln, Crosley, Willys, Hudson, Hupmobile, King and Studebaker, led Murray to expand his operations. In 1915 Murray hired architect Albert Kahn, to design a larger industrial center to meet the demands of Detroit's growing automotive industry. Kahn was one of Detroit's foremost industrial architects, known for his large concrete- reinforced automobile factories. His design was strong, fireproof, inexpensive to construct, and opened up by eliminating heavy obstructive columns. Another characteristic was providing a large amount of windows and gaslight to give factory workers an ample amount of natural light. J W Murray Mfg. Co merged with another of Henry Ford's major suppliers, C R Wilson Body Co, when Wilson's owner and founder died. Adding some more smaller firms they formed Murray Body Corporation in 1924 and became after Fisher and Briggs the third largest body company in the United States. J W Murray retired soon after the merger and his son set up his own new business. Murray Corporation's new president, Allan Sheldon, made a series of costly mistakes which created financial difficulties when combined with the sharp recession of 1924-1925. However sales rebounded in 1925 and following a financial reorganisation Murray Corporation of America was formed to continue the business. In the 1940s Murray Corporation manufactured military supplies, airplane wings and other components of the fighter/bomber planes, and washing machines for Montgomery-Ward. When the war came to an end, expressways opened up the city of Detroit to the surrounding suburbs. This led to suburbanization, and another recession for Murray Corporation. Murray Corporation continued manufacturing automotive parts until 1955. In 1960 Packard Properties (Helmsley-Spear Inc., of New York) renamed the complex Russell Industrial Center'Michigan: A Reference Study - Page 48, Industrial Development Manufacturers Record. Conway Publications, Atlanta Georgia, 1962 and began leasing out space describing the complex as an 11-plant \\"apartment house for industry\\". At that time tenants already included sixty manufacturing and distribution firms and more than half a million square feet remained available.Russell Industrial Center. Detroit Engineer Volumes 25-28, Page 238. Engineering Society of Detroit, 1960 A later owner of the Russell Industrial Center was Leona Helmsley who purchased the complex in 1970 and sold it in 1991, to printer Wintor-Swan. In 1998, the Russell was damaged by a tornado and storm that flooded and destroyed the building's transformer and many of the windows. The Swan Company experienced financial difficulties and could not afford to stay in business. The building stood vacant and in disrepair until its purchase by Dennis Kefallinos, owner of Boydell Development Company, for one million dollars.Crain News Service September 10, 2008 Due to safety code violations, the building has been ordered vacated as of Feb. 21, 2017. By 2018 issues with the city had been resolved and the Russell Industrial Center transformed into a center for small business and the arts. It is currently home to over one hundred small businesses and artists.  Renovation  Since the structure of Kahn's building was made of concrete and was covered in windows, Kefallinos decided that it would be suitable for art studios and began plans to create several lofts for studio space. His efforts are an example of Urban development in Detroit. His plan to transform an industrial building into lofts, and promote the arts is recognized as one of the many urban renewal efforts in the city of Detroit. In 2010 artist Kobie Solomon painted the Detroit Chimera Graffiti Mural on building number 2.

The project is an idea of the artists Marco Porta and Mari Brignolo. Risalto was the first modern art exhibition in the world that presented mosaics reproduced exclusively in coloured rice. International artists were invited to design the mosaics, that were then produced by the creators of the event in collaboration with the artists.  Technique  A phase of the creation of a rice mosaic The production of the mosaic is a long and complicated process that requires precision and patience. Every year the project starts with the invitation of some selected artists, whose task is to create a stub: usually a drawing or a painting or just criteria for the production of the mosaic. The artist's work is then enlarged and copied on the support 2 metres square. The next step is the colouring of the rice, in the various colours and tones needed, dipping it into a bath of aniline, acrylics or enamel paints. Sometimes, to make the final work fit to the original artist's project, it has been necessary to use extraordinary types of colouring (carbon, nacre, glitter). The rice, dried and covered with a protecting varnish, is then stuck on the support. Lastly there is a finer colouring made using brushes or airbrush, or particular colours; sometimes the artist themselves comes to refine and complete the work.  History  The project RisAlto started in 2001 from an idea of Mari Brignolo and Marco Porta.

Restricted to a single cliff-top dune system on the remote south coast of Western Australia, it is listed as rare and endangered. It was discovered by E. Charles Nelson in 1973, and formally described and named in 1978. Description Adenanthos eyrei grows as an erect shrub up to a metre tall, without a lignotuber, and with warty bark on older stems. Leaves are about 15 mm long, and usually segmented into three lobes, each up to 10 mm long and around 3 mm wide. As with A. cuneata, young leaves are bright red. The flower is dark crimson, with a 25 mm long perianth and a 35 mm style. Reports of flowering time vary: some say that it flowers only in October, others that it flowers throughout the year. Taxonomy The first herbarium collection of A. eyrei was made in October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited the south coast to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from an interest in the problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore made collections at several locations, including three cliff-top dune systems of siliceous sand, isolated from each other by the calcareous soils of the Nullarbor Plain. A. eyrei was found only on the sand patch at Toolinna Cove, though initially Nelson did not rule out the possibility of it occurring also on the sand patches at Twilight Cove and Point Culver. Four years later Nelson published a comprehensive taxonomic revision of Adenanthos, formally publishing this species and naming it Adenanthos eyrei in honour of Edward John Eyre, the first explorer to visit the area, who is thought to have passed through the Toolinna sandpatch around 1 May 1840. Nelson followed George Bentham in dividing Adenanthos into two sections, placing A. eyrei into A. sect. Adenanthos because its perianth tube is fairly straight, and not swollen above the middle. He further divided the section into two subsections, with A. eyrei placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of A. eyrei in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: ::Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. × cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus The species is most closely related to A. forrestii, from which it can be distinguished by its much larger leaves, its darker flowers, and by the absence of a lignotuber. As of 2009, the question has been asked whether these differences in fact suffice to distinguish the two species from each other. Observations have shown both species to have quite variable flower colour, and neither a slight difference in leaf shape nor the presence or absence of a lignotuber as usually accepted as legitimate grounds for distinguishing species. A taxonomic review of A. eyrei is under way. =Common names= The common name most often reported for A. eyrei is Toolinna Adenanthos. However Nelson regards this as a \\"concocted\\" common name, \\"rather crudely made up from an English word or two tagged on to unitalicized Adenanthos\\", and adds that Eyre's rather than Toolinna \\"would have respectfully preserved the associations intended by the original author\\". Distribution and habitat This species is known only from a single population growing on a cliff-top dune system about 200 m east of Toolinna Cove, on the coastal margin of the Nullarbor Plain in southern Western Australia. Even at that locality it is very rare: monitoring suggests a stable population of between 200 and 250 individual plants. It grows on dunes of deep siliceous sand, amongst low open scrub, sandheath or kwongan. Associated species include A. forrestii, A. cuneatus, Banksia epica and B. media. Conservation Adenanthos eyrei is gazetted as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 and is listed as endangered under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Potential threats include ;Fire: Because the species lacks a lignotuber, it is killed by fire, so populations survive fire only by regenerating from seed. This makes them vulnerable to a too-frequent fire regime in which plants are burnt before they have had time to reach reproductive maturity and establish a soil seed bank adequate for regeneration. ;Disease: Reports vary on the susceptibility of A. eyrei to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. In 2006 it was reported to be highly susceptible, but the species' Recovery Plan states that its susceptibility has never been assessed. ;Wind erosion: The occurrence of A. eyrei on a cliff-top dune system makes it vulnerable to erosion by the wind. ;Vehicle tracks: One of the main access tracks within Nuytsland Nature Reserve runs through the middle of the population, creating the threat of direct damage by vehicles, providing a vector for the transmission of disease, and increasing the potential for wind erosion. The habitat is secure against most other threats, as it falls entirely within the Nuytsland Nature Reserve, and is in an extremely remote area rarely visited by humans. The species is currently being managed by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation under a five-year Recovery Plan. Actions being undertaken or considered include: a taxonomic review of the species; closure of the access track that passes through the population; ongoing surveys, mapping and monitoring of the population and habitat; the collection and ex-situ storage of seed; the collection of cuttings for cultivation at Kings Park and Botanic Gardens; and further research into the biology and ecology of the species. Cultivation Adenanthos eyrei is utterly unknown in cultivation, and probably has no horticultural potential.

Before adopting their software, individual banks in Pakistan were using a software application that allowed them to have links with only their own ATMs during regular banking hours only. Most banks in Pakistan needed to have online network connectivity for their ATMs especially after banking hours.

Enschedé, a historical site in Haarlem that was dug up in the 1990s and is today home to an underground parking garage. The building was previously a workshop for the Grafische Inrichting, or Typography. The Joh. Enschedé company was at one time the largest printer in the Netherlands which from 1737-1940 printed the Oprechte Haerlemsche Courant and from 1810 onwards became a mint that printed banknotes and later postage stamps. The museum used to have on display an overview of the art of printing in Haarlem and the Typeography of Enschedé in particular. The collection of newspapers has been put online via the Koninklijke Bibliotheek and the collection of atlasses by Joan Blaeu has also been digitized. Work is being done to digitize other parts of the collection. There are artifacts regarding Costeriana (things that support the legend of Laurens Janszoon Coster) and the art of printing banknotes through the centuries in Haarlem.

Non per un dio ma nemmeno per gioco: Vita di Fabrizio De André, Feltrinelli Editore«In spite of all predictions, the kidnapping only strengthened De André's love for Sardinia and, as already mentioned, materialized in an album focused on the similarity between the Sardinian people and the Indian people, foretold by the cover image of the American painter Frederic Remington, representing a Native American on horseback.» Sanna, Silvia (2009). Fabrizio De André: storie, memorie ed echi letterari, Effepi Libri, p.93 It opens with the sounds of gunshots and people shouting from a bison hunting party, recorded in Sardinia especially for the album but intended to represent a hunting scene by Native Americans. These sounds also reappear in other sections through the album (the people involved in the hunting party are not credited). Also, the songs \\"Fiume Sand Creek\\", \\"Hotel Supramonte\\" and \\"Franziska\\" start with piano/keyboards introductions, musically unrelated to the songs themselves. The intro to \\"Hotel Supramonte\\" is freely based on \\"Summer '68\\" by Pink Floyd's Richard Wright (from Atom Heart Mother), deliberately inserted by keyboard player Mark Harris as a further Floydian reference, in addition to his arrangement for \\"Ave Maria\\" (see below). *\\"Quello che non ho\\" (\\"What I haven't got\\") is an ironical blues song, where De André describes himself as lacking the possessions, benefits and advantages typically associated with wealthy people or upper classes in general. *\\"Canto del servo pastore\\" (\\"Shepherd Servant's Song\\") is a gentle, moderately-paced ballad about a shepherd's idyllic lifestyle. *\\"Fiume Sand Creek\\" (\\"Sand Creek river\\") is a country & western song, including multiple (layered) acoustic guitars, percussion and male backing vocals, whose lyrics are a transfigured account of the Sand Creek massacre in 1864, seen from the point of view of one of the victims. *\\"Ave Maria\\", a folk song from Sardinia based on a version of the Hail Mary prayer in the local language, was sung in a choral multi-tracked style by Connecticut-born keyboardist Mark Harris providing the higher vocals, and De André providing the lower ones. According to Harris's recollections within \\"L'anarchia\\" [\\"Anarchy\\"], the seventh DVD in the 2011 documentary series Dentro Faber [\\"Inside Faber\\"] about De André's life and work, the song was supposed to be sung by a group of tenores, a Sardinian polyphonic male choir, and Harris recorded a demo with his own voice to teach the song to the choir. However, when De André heard the demo, he was impressed by Harris's performance and told him: \\"Fuck it all, just sing this by yourself,\\" also adding that he loved Harris's voice when it was strained.Interview with Mark Harris about his collaborations with De André and Enzo Jannacci (in Italian) The final recording, with an instrumental arrangement inspired by Pink Floyd (particularly by their 1971 album Meddle), does indeed feature Harris's full- throated singing from the demo, which he jokingly referred to as \\"a highly unlikely vocal performance by an American singing a Sardinian song in Sardinian.\\" Harris also explained that, although he is not really a Pink Floyd fan, he does own a copy of Meddle, and that he played it for De André during the sessions, in response to the latter's request to find unusual, weird sounds.Dentro Faber DVD series; vol. 7, L'anarchia [Anarchy]. *\\"Hotel Supramonte\\" refers to the kidnapping of De André and Dori Ghezzi in 1979 in the Supramonte area of Sardinia. As with other songs concerned with personal matters, De André's lyrics are not a direct account of the event or of its circumstances, but instead a metaphorically idealized, poetic vision of it through his own eyes. The singer addresses a woman and invites her to spend some time with him at the \\"Supramonte Hotel\\", in an attempt to regain some feelings of love – which he laments she has lost. De André sings the whole lyric in a sweet, quiet style, without any traces of sadness or – for that matter – of anger. *\\"Franziska\\" is a Latin American-flavored song, set as a fast rumba at 130 BPM (almost a bachata). The lyrics are about a Spanish girl, a penniless unlucky suitor of hers (described alternately as a \\"bandit with no moon, no stars and no luck\\" and as a \\"forest sailor [i.e. not a seafaring man at all], without sleep and without songs\\") and a painter who, although nearly blind, is madly in love with her and morbidly jealous of everyone else. *\\"Se ti tagliassero a pezzetti\\" (\\"If somebody cut you into little pieces\\") is, unusually for De André, a straightforwardly sentimental love song, addressing a nameless and possibly imaginary woman. (In the second-to-last verse, he calls her \\"Mrs. Liberty, Miss Fantasy\\"; in live performances, he changed the latter to \\"Miss Anarchy\\".) The title, inspired by Nick Mason's tongue-in-cheek vocal phrase (\\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces!\\") on Pink Floyd's \\"One of These Days\\", also from Meddle, is not meant to be understood literally, but just as ironically as Mason's utterance in Pink Floyd's experimental track. Indeed, the first two lines in De André's song are as follows: \\"If somebody cut you into little pieces / The wind would pick them all up and gather them.\\" In one line, De André refers to himself as \\"Me, a guitar player; me, a violin player\\"; although the word \\"violin\\" was mainly chosen for rhyming purposes, De André did actually play both violin and guitar in his youth, starting on the former and then switching to the latter, and his son Cristiano is equally proficient on both. *\\"Verdi pascoli\\" (\\"Green pastures\\") is a joyous, quasi-reggae song, including prominent keyboards, backing vocals and a short drum solo. Its lyrics, inspired by a book on Native American culture De André was reading at the time, are about a very stylized and non-religious representation of a happy afterlife, closer to Summerland than to the Christian vision of Heaven. Personnel The musicians playing on the album were all hand-picked by Mark Harris, who also took care of the arrangements.Told by Harris in Dentro Faber, vol. 7, as above. The line-up features, among others, top Italian session men such as Gabriele \\"Lele\\" Melotti, Pier Michelatti, Aldo Banfi and Massimo Luca, as well as De Andrè's wife Dori Ghezzi and co-producer Oscar Prudente on backing vocals. *Fabrizio De André – Acoustic guitar in \\"Franziska\\" and \\"Hotel Supramonte\\", lead and backing vocals. *Lele Melotti – Drum kit *Pier Michelatti – Bass guitar *Tony Soranno – Acoustic and electric guitars *Mark Harris – Keyboards, synthesizers, lead vocals on \\"Ave Maria\\", backing vocals *Aldo Banfi – Synthesizer *Pietro Pellegrini – Oberheim OB-X *Maurizio Preti – Percussion *Andy J.

Today it serves as a museum displaying collections and photographs of the Asian–African Conference, the first Non-Aligned Movement that was held there in 1955.Indonesia handbook, Volume 3  Architecture  Conference hall in Gedung Merdeka in 2010. The present building was designed in 1926 in art deco style by Van Galen and C.P. Wolff Schoemaker, both professors at Technische Hogeschool (today ITB) and famous architects of that time. The 7500 m² building had Italian marble floors, some saloon and rooms in cikenhout wooden finishing, and was adorned with crystal lamps on the ceilings.  History  The 19th century Sociëteit Concordia before its rebuilt in 1926. The first building on the site at the intersection of Braga Street and Jalan Asia-Africa was constructed in 1895 for the Sociëteit Concordia. In 1926 it was rebuilt by Wolff Schoemacher, Albert Aalbers and Van Gallen.Gedung Merdeka The Sociëteit Concordia was the dance hall, entertainment and social gathering venue for rich people in Bandung and its vicinity. That included plantation owners or employees, officers, officials, and wealthy businessman. During weekends, the building was filled with people enjoying art performances, social dances and dinner. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the building was renamed Dai Toa Kaman and served as cultural centre. After the Indonesian proclamation of Independence on 17 August 1945, the building was used as headquarters of Indonesian independence fighters against Japanese troops. After the recognition of Indonesian Independence by The Netherlands in 1949, and the formation of federal government of Negara Pasundan, Concordia building was once again used as public gathering hall, for art performances, parties, dances, and gala dinner. In 1954, the government of Indonesia appointed Bandung as the host of Asian–African Conference, the Concordia building chosen as the venue of this International conference. At that time Concordia was the largest and grandest hall in Bandung, with strategic location near Savoy Homann Hotel and Preanger Hotel in the city centre. In early 1955, the building was renovated to meet international conference requirements by Ir. R. Srigati Santoso, and renamed Gedung Merdeka (independence building). The building also served as Indonesian House of Representatives (MPR) convention building. In 1965 the Gedung Merdeka was the venue for the Asian-African Islamic Conference. In 1971 all of the House of Representatives meetings and activities were moved to Jakarta. In March 1980 the building hosted the 25th anniversary of the Asian-African Conference, and the Asian-African Conference Museum was inaugurated by president Soeharto.

Life John Richard, son of John and Elizabeth Walbran, was born at Ripon, Yorkshire, on 24 December 1817, and educated at Whixley in the same county. After leaving school he assisted his father, an iron merchant, and eventually became an independent wine merchant. From his early years he had a marked taste for historical and antiquarian studies, and all the time that he could spare from his avocation was occupied with archaeological investigations, especially with respect to the ecclesiastical and feudal history of his native county. His study of the records of Fountains Abbey led him to make a specialty of the history of the whole Cistercian order. A paper by him On the Necessity of clearing out the Conventual Church of Fountains, written in 1846, originated the excavations at Fountains Abbey, which were carried out under his personal direction. Walbran was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 12 January 1854. He was the mayor of Ripon in 1856 and 1857. He married, in September 1849, Jane, daughter of Richard Nicholson of Ripon, and left two sons, the elder of whom, Francis Maximillian Walbran of Leeds, is the author of works on angling. In April 1868 he was struck with paralysis, and died on 7 April 1869. He is buried in Holy Trinity churchyard, Ripon. Works Although he had great literary ability, he had a singular dislike to the mechanical part of authorship, that connected with printing, and had it not been for the encouragement and technical assistance of his friend William Harrison, printer, of Ripon, few of his writings would have been printed. The first edition of his Guide to Ripon was printed in 1844, and was succeeded by nine other editions in his lifetime. His chief work, The Memorials of the Abbey of St. Mary of Fountains (Surtees Soc. 1864–78, 2 vols.), was left unfinished. Another uncompleted work was his History of Gainford, Durham, 1851. He also made some progress with a History of the Wapentake of Claro and the Liberty of Ripon, and a History of the Parish of Halifax. Walbran's minor works include: * Genealogical Account of the Lords of Studley Royal, 1841; reprinted, with additions, by Canon Raine in vol. ii. of Memorials of Fountains. works on Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal * A Summer's Day at Bolton Abbey, 1847; regarding Bolton Abbey * Visitors' Guide to Redcar, 1848. * On the Oath taken by Members of the Parliaments of Scotland from 1641, 1854. * Notes on the Manuscripts at Ripley Castle, 1864. on materials in the library at Ripley Castle His manuscripts were after his death purchased by Edward Akroyd of Halifax, and presented by him to York Cathedral Library.

The songs were written by Fabrizio De André and Mauro Pagani. As Pagani revealed in an interview within the 2011 DVD biographical documentary series Dentro Faber (i.e. Inside Faber, the latter being De André's nickname in Genoese), he is responsible for the writing of most of the music, while De André wrote all of the lyricsDentro Faber DVD series, vol. 5: Genova ed il Mediterraneo [Genoa and the Mediterranean]. – except for Don Raffaè, detailed below, whose lyric writing is shared between De André and singer-songwriter Massimo Bubola, and the lyrics to the two songs in Genoese on side B, \\"Mégu megún\\" and \\"'Â çímma\\", which De André co-wrote with fellow Genoan Ivano Fossati because, according to De André, his colleague's ability to play with the sounds and the inner melodies of the Genoese dialect was much better than his own.Dentro Faber, DVD 5, as above. Pagani's collaboration with De André, always according to the Lombard musician, happened in an identical way for De André's previous album, Crêuza de mä, with Pagani setting to music De André's already fully written lyrics, on the basis of a few melodic ideas from the latter. His next songwriting collaboration with Fossati, on Anime salve, would be more equally balanced, with he and Fossati composing music by actually playing together.Dentro Faber DVD series, vol. 2: Gli ultimi [The lesser ones].

Side A concerns contemporary society and the songs are all written in Italian, except for \\"Don Raffaé\\" (see below), written in a very Italianized Neapolitan. Side B concerns traditions and stories from the past, and the songs are written in three different languages spoken within Italy. =Side A= *\\"Le nuvole\\" (\\"The clouds\\") features an orchestral background written by Pagani and orchestrated by Piero Milesi, over which two Sardinian women, who were chosen for their age difference (the elder Lalla Pisano and the young Maria Mereu) recite a free-verse poem apparently about clouds; the real subjects in the poem, which is inspired by Aristophanes's same-titled comedy, are in fact prominent figures who disturb and disrupt ordinary people's lives, namely politicians and powerful business managers. *\\"Ottocento\\" (\\"Eight hundred\\", but with a pun on \\"1800s\\") is an intentionally funny song sung by De André in a mock-operatic style, musically set as an operetta-like waltz, and inspired by his colleague and friend Francesco Baccini, which parodies the hustle and bustle of modern life. It also features a section in tempo rubato, where De André, singing normally, mocks the dramatic style and subject matter of his own early compositions, such as \\"La canzone di Marinella\\". After the interlude, De Andrè moves into a faux-German section, comically mixing authentic German words with Italian \\"Germanized\\" ones. (Eine kleine Pinzimonie, wunder Matrimonie, Krauten und Erbeeren... etc.)The full lyrics to the \\"German\\" section read as follows: \\"Eine kleine Pinzimonie, wunder Matrimonie, Krauten und Erbeeren / und Patellen und Arsellen fischen Zanzibar; / und einige Krapfen früher von schlafen, und erwachen mit der Walzer / und die Alka-Seltzer für dimenticar.\\" These are 'translated' by De André in the liner notes as \\"A little pinzimonio (an olive oil-based sauce), wonderful marriage, sauerkrauts and strawberries / and patellas and tellinas fished in Zanzibar; / and a few krapfens before sleeping, and wake up with the waltz / and the Alka-Seltzer [tablet] to forget.\\" All of the grammar here is intentionally wrong, as well as De André's pronunciation. This section, which is supposed to be set in Tyrol, leads to the coda of the song, an increasingly fast yodel. All of the instrumentation in the song is orchestral. When performing it live, during his 1990–1991 tour to promote the album, De André wore a black tie attire, to underline the satirical aspects of the lyrics, and sang the entire song while standing up – which was extremely unusual for him. He ran offstage during the yodel section and reappeared onstage shortly thereafter, for \\"Don Raffaé\\", in his usual stage outfit – bleached jeans and a black sweater. *\\"Don Raffaè\\" is a satirical/parody song about Italian Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, partly sung in Neapolitan from the point of view of a jailer in the Poggioreale prison where Cutolo is kept; by portraying the character as a close friend of the titular Raffaele's, De André uses references to the real Cutolo (such as the famous \\"maxi-trial\\" in the late Eighties, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment), never naming him explicitly, to spoof a number of well-known Italian stereotypes about Camorra, Naples and Neapolitans in general. An ironical footnote printed in the booklet after the lyrics says: \\"The facts and characters in this song are fictional. Any references to actual people are nothing but coincidences.\\"Le nuvole CD booklet. In 1992 the song was covered by Roberto Murolo as a duet with De André; Murolo's cover is included in his album Ottantavogliadicantare, celebrating the singer's 80th birthday – the album's title being a pun on Ho tanta voglia (i.e. I feel like (singing) so much) and ottanta (i.e. eighty).Entry for Ottantavogliadicantare on Discogs For Murolo's cover, the arrangement was changed into a slightly slower and more traditionally Neapolitan-sounding tarantella beat, featuring additional keyboards and percussion. *\\"La domenica delle salme\\" (\\"On Corpses Sunday\\", with a pun on Palm Sunday) describes the dissolution (and, more generically, the loss of importance) of the Communist ideology in Europe at the end of the 1980s, and the ensuing political chaos caused in Italy by such dissolution, again without explicitly mentioning anyone's names, but depicting a series of grotesque, highly stylized characters and situations. De André's utter, resentful disillusionment with the then-current political outlook is underlined by his occasional use of vulgar language: an imaginary \\"Minister of Rainstorms\\" is described by the singer as \\"hop[ing] for democracy with a tablecloth in his hands and his hands on his bollocks\\"; describing a woman climbing up a section of the just-demolished Berlin Wall, he sings: \\"While she was climbing, every one of us saw her ass\\"; later on, talking about his singer-songwriter colleagues in Italy and accusing them of having forsaken their political stance in the name of commercialism, he remembers that \\"All of you had powerful voices, fitting for a «fuck you!»\\". The music for this song, consisting of an almost-recited, low-key monologue over two intervals of no more than five notes each, and backed by a complex acoustic guitar accompaniment in 9/8, has been described by De André and Pagani at the time (namely, on the eighth and final volume of the Dentro Faber DVD series) as very forced and almost unsingable, as it was written after the lyrics and meant to adapt to them, rather than vice versa. Side A also features two piano excerpts from Tchaikovsky's \\"The Seasons\\", before and after \\"Don Raffaé\\", played by pianist Andrea Carcano. Furthermore, the side opens and closes with the sound of grasshoppers singing, which symbolizes people talking endlessly and aimlessly. =Side B= *\\"Mégu megún\\", written in Genoese, is a satirical song about deficiencies and malpractice in the Italian health care system, personified by a greedy physician who cares much more about money than about his patients' well-being. De André's sparse usage of profanity emerges again here: \\"Ooh, what a fucking contract you would make me sign!\\" The song has a world music feel, with Pagani playing several ethnic instruments and singing backing vocals in an invented, pseudo-African language (\\"ooh welele, ooh welelele\\"). *\\"La nova gelosia\\" is De André's rendition of a romantic anoymous song from 1700s Naples, which he learnt from Roberto Murolo (who recorded it earlier). The lyrics, written in a poetical, literary form of Neapolitan, are a lament by a young boy in love with a girl who has recently installed a new blind on her window; the boy implores the blind itself, which is adorned with small, shining golden nails, to stay open and let him see his loved one, otherwise he will die. The song was not included in the setlist of De André's 1990–'91 promotional tour for the album, as its delicate instrumentation did not translate well to an arena stage. *\\"Â çímma\\", in Genoese, is a very detailed description of a Genoan recipe for a traditional boiled stuffed veal dish. The preparation process and the ingredients are described at length in the lyrics, and the \\"rope\\" referred to in the title is actually the cotton thread used to tie the stuffed veal up. The lyrics also mention some ancient folk traditions, such as setting a broom upright in a corner to keep witches away from the kitchen; according to the tradition, if a witch came into the kitchen by sliding down the chimney and the fireplace, she was compelled by the desire to count all of the bristles in the broom and would not stop until dawn, when she was forced to leave. The final verse mentions the fact that a bachelor is entitled to give the first knife-cut to the finished dish. *\\"Monti di Mola\\" (\\"Mountains of Mola\\"), a song written in Gallurese, set in Gallura and inspired by a local folk tale, describes a love affair between a female donkey and a young shepherd. They fall passonately in love with each other and want to marry, but they are unable to, because their birth certificates reveal them to be first cousins. The song, like most of Side B, features a simple, folk-based arrangement, once again adorned by a variety of ethnic instruments played by Pagani. Sardinian trio Tazenda sing backing vocals on the track, which, like \\"La nova gelosia\\", was never performed live by De André. Personnel Among its musicians, the album features prominent Italian sessionmen Lele Melotti, Paolo Costa, Amedeo Bianchi and Demo Morselli, as well as members of De André's regular live band at the time, such as ethnologist Mario Arcari and guitarist Michele Ascolese; Flavio Premoli from PFM and \\"Rocco Tanica\\" from Elio e le Storie Tese are also featured, the latter credited with his real name (Sergio Conforti).

The final project was published in October. In 2008 the building was named 'Sky Towers', during the year slurry wall were installed. Preparation for foundation pit began in 2009. In April 2010 construction of eight underground floors began, in May the first tower crane was set. The construction process went very slow, with pauses due to financial difficulties. 16 September 2010 illegal workers from Turkey, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, that were building the skyscraper were arrestedhttp://1tv.com.ua/ru/news/2010/09/16/1616. In October the Turkish company Ant Yapi became the project's main contractorhttps://emlakkulisi.com/ant-yapidan-ukraynada-yeni-bir-sky-towers- projesi/50469. In October 2011 construction of zero floor began. 24 October the underground floors were finished and preparation for the first floor construction began. In May 2012 an American company, called Cimbrorum Holdings LLC bought the project, KDD Group developer took a credit from them and Ukreximbank to build the skyscraper. Also planned hotel inside the lower tower was cancelled. In November the Tower A's first floor construction began, next month Tower B's zero floor was complete. In January of 2013 the building rose above one floor and started 'growing' quickly. Due to unseasonable weather of March construction has slowed. In May Tower A had ten floors and Tower B had seven. In June both towers reached 11 floors, which was a limit in main contractor's contract, so construction was paused for some time. In July construction continued, since August both towers were being constructed concurrently. The building reached 15 floors in October and 20 in December. In December it reached 20 floors. In January 2014 first glass was installed on facade of the Tower A. 17 February a 1.5 m long metal rod flew off the construction site and struck a car, as a result it pierced the roof and one passenger got minor injurieshttps://www.segodnya.ua/kiev/kaccidents/v-kieve- truba-so-stroyki-edva-ne-ubila-passazhirov-inomarki-496173.html. After Euromaidan construction slightly slowed. In March the building had 23 floors and was already taller than 100 meters. At the end of the month the building already had 25 floors. A glass facade was installed on Tower B, first escalators were set in the atrium. In April glass installation began on both towers. In the end of the month atrium's construction began, it was finished in May. Next month there were 27 floors ready and glass installation was ongoing. Next month construction of new floors was stopped, but the glass installation accelerated. During July-August almost a half of the building already had glass installed. 2 August 2015 KDD Group, building's developer, went bankrupt, unable to pay all the debts to Cimbrorum and Ukreximbankhttp://domik.ua/novosti/u-kiyevi-stalo-odnim-zabudovnikom-menshe- yak-likvidovuvali-kdd-group-n240365.html.

These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety- conscious field, particularly for their resistance to fatigue. The field of materials engineering is an important one within aerospace engineering. Its practice is defined by the international standards bodies who maintain standards for the materials and processes involved. Engineers in this field may often have studied for degrees or post-graduate qualifications in it as a speciality.  History  Radome over H2S radar scanner on a Halifax Honeycomb sandwich structure of Glass Reinforced Aluminum = Edwardian period = The first aerospace materials were those long-established and often naturally occurring materials used to construct the first aircraft. These included such mundane materials as timber for wing structures and fabric and dope to cover them. Their quality was of utmost importance and so the timber would be of carefully selected sitka spruce and the covering of irish linen. Standards were required for the selection, manufacture, and use of these materials. These standards were developed informally by manufacturers or government groups such as HM Balloon Factory, later to become RAE Farnborough, often with the assistance of university engineering departments. The next stage in the development of aerospace materials was to adopt newly developed materials, such as Duralumin the first age hardening aluminum alloy. These offered attributes not previously available. Many of these new materials also required study to determine the extent of these new properties, their behavior and how to make the best use of them. This work was often carried out through the new government-funded national laboratories, such as the Reichsanstalt (German Imperial Institute) or the British National Physical Laboratory (NPL). = World War I = The NPL was also responsible for perhaps the first deliberately engineered aerospace material, Y alloy. This first of the nickel- aluminum alloys was discovered after a series of experimentsExperiment 'Y' of the series, giving the alloy its name. during World War I, deliberately setting out to find a better material for the manufacture of pistons for aircraft engines. = Interwar period = Between the wars, many aerospace innovations were in the field of manufacturing processes, rather than just an inherently stronger material, although these too benefited from improved materials. One of the R.R. alloys, R.R.53B, had added silicon which improved its fluidity when molten. This allowed its use for die casting as well as the previous sand casting, a means of making parts that were both far cheaper and also more accurate in shape and finish. Better control of their shape allowed designers to shape them more precisely to their tasks, leading to parts that were also thinner and lighter. Many interwar developments were to aircraft engines, which benefited from the vast improvements being made for the growing car industry. Although not strictly an 'aerospace' innovation, the use of refractory alloys like Stellite and Brightray for the hard-facing of exhaust valves offered huge gains in the reliability of aircraft engines. This itself encouraged long-range commercial flights, as the new engines were reliable enough to be considered safe for long flights across oceans or mountain ranges. = World War II = The de Havilland Albatross airliner of 1936 had a fuselage of wooden sandwich construction: wafers of birch plywood were spaced apart by a balsa sheet. This same construction achieved fame with its wartime use in the Mosquito fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminum, a strategic material during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialized aircraft metalworkers. When Germany attempted to copy this aircraft as the Moskito it was a failure, primarily for materials reasons. The original phenolic Tego film adhesive was only produced by a factory that was destroyed by bombing. Its replacement led directly to catastrophic failures and loss of the aircraft. Radar became small enough to be carried on board aircraft, but the fragile feed horns and reflectors needed to be protected and streamlined from the airstream. Molded radomes were constructed, using the Perspex acrylic plastic that was already in use for cockpit windows. This could be heated to soften it, then molded or vacuum formed to shape. Other polymers developed at this time, notably Nylon, found uses in compact radio equipment as high-voltage insulators or dielectrics. Honeycomb structures were developed as flat sandwich sheets used for bulkheads and decking. These were long established with wood and paper board construction, but required a more robust material for aerospace use. This was achieved towards the end of the war, with all-aluminum honeycomb sandwiches. = Post-war = = New materials = New lightweight materials include Ceramic matrix composites, metal matrix composites, polymer aerogels and CNT- yarns, along the evolution of polymer composites.  Marketing outside aerospace  Carbon fiber money clip The term \\"aerospace grade\\" has come to be a fashionable marketing slogan for luxury goods, particularly for cars and sporting goods. Bicycles, golf clubs, sailing yachts and even flashlights are all sold on the basis of their high-performance materials, whether these are relevant or not. Since their appearance in 1979, Maglite have advertised their use of 6061 aluminum for their torch bodies, one of the first to make a deliberate feature of aerospace materials for a non-performance reason. Some sporting uses have been for the material's actual qualities. Many ski makers have produced skis wholly from cloth and resin composite materials, using the tailorability of such construction to vary the stiffness, damping and torsional stiffness of a ski along its length. Hexcel, a manufacturer of aluminum honeycomb sheet, became well known for its branded skis, using this same advanced material. Sporting uses may be every bit as demanding as aerospace needs. Particularly in cycling, materials may be loaded more highly than in aerospace use, the risk of possible failure being seen as more acceptable than for aircraft. Many uses of aerospace materials for sporting goods have been as the result of a 'peace dividend'. After World War II, Hiduminium alloy appeared in bicycle brake components as its maker sought to expand new markets to replace their previous military aircraft. In the 1990s, both smelters and recyclers of titanium sought new non-military markets after the end of the Cold War, finding them in both bicycle frames and golf clubs. Carbon fiber composite, and its distinctive weave pattern, has become a popular decorative choice on cars and motorbikes, even in purely decorative contexts such as dashboards. This has extended to the use of flexible stick-on patterned vinyl to skeuomorphically reproduce the appearance, without any of the physical properties.

The Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth is a set of principles and guidelines set up to assist the G20 nations and other global actors in working collaboratively with less developed countries in order to boost their economic growth and to achieve the UN's Millennium Development Goals. It was endorsed by the leaders of G20 nations at the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit, with a multi-year action plan drafted for the delivery of tangible results. In contrast with the older Washington Consensus, the Seoul Consensus allows a larger role for state intervention. Rather than seeking to impose a uniform \\"top down\\" solution, it postulates that solutions should be tailored to the requirements of individual developing nations, with the developing countries themselves taking the lead in designing packages of reforms and policies best suited to their needs. The Washington Consensus as originally defined was a set of ten key principles. The new Consensus is based on six core principles and has nine \\"key pillars\\". Core Principles The six core principles of the Seoul consensus are: * Focus on economic growth The G20 suggest that economic growth is closely linked with low income countries' (LICs) ability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They state that measures to promote inclusive, sustainable and resilient growth should take precedence over business as usual. * Global development partnership. LICs should be treated as equal partners, with national ownership for their own development. Partnerships should be transparent and accountable. * Global or regional systemic issues. The G20 should prioritise regional or systemic issues where their collective action is best placed to deliver beneficial changes. * Private sector participation. The G20 recognise the importance of private actors in contributing to growth and suggest that policies should be business friendly. * Complementarity. The G20 will try to avoid duplicating the efforts of other global actors, focussing their efforts on areas where they have a comparative advantage. * Outcome orientation. The G20 will focus on tangible practical measures to address significant problems. =Key Pillars= The nine key pillars are areas believed to be most in need of attention within developing countries. These are 1) infrastructure, 2) private investment and job creation, 3) human resource development, 4) trade, 5) financial inclusion, 6) resilient growth, 7) food security, 8) domestic resource mobilization 9) knowledge sharing. History of the Seoul consensus The Seoul consensus was created by the G20, to what extent it was influenced by calls for a \\"Seoul development consensus\\" from NGOs such as Oxfam is not yet fully clear. =Creation= Development issues have been discussed at G20 leader level since the 2009 London summit. After the 2010 Toronto summit the G20 issued a statement saying that \\"narrowing the development gap and reducing poverty are integral\\" to their broader goals. Shortly after it was announced the next summit would be in Seoul, civil society actors including Oxfam began advocating for what they called a \\"Seoul Development Consensus\\". The G20's original draft document for the consensus had included provisions to allow the poorest countries unrestricted access to the markets of G20 economies, something which NGOs and even religious leaders such as the Pope had strongly advocated for in his 2009 social encyclical. The provision was dropped from the final declaration as not all members could agree. =Implementation= After their 2011 April meeting of Finance ministers the G20 released a communique where they emphasised the importance of implementing the Consensus, saying they were anticipating concrete recommendations to be released by their high level panel in September. Reactions Initial reactions on the Seoul consensus have been mixed. An editorial in The Financial Times described its \\"pragmatic and pluralistic view of development\\" as appealing, but also suggested it might \\"do little more than drive another nail into the coffin of a long-deceased Washington consensus\\" An article published by The Wall Street Journal was somewhat more positive, noting that a concrete step already taken was to create a new panel of 12 countries that would work on infrastructure financing. The Korean Daily News published an article suggesting the Consensus may turn out to be the only durable achievement of the Seoul Summit. British charity CAFOD said the new consensus was \\"eerily familiar\\" compared to the earlier Washington version, and were not pleased with the emphases on involving the private sector, especially with infrastructure. Oxfam's Avinash Kumar was disappointed by the whole focus on physical infrastructure, suggesting a clearer commitment to improving social infrastructure in less developed countries would have been better. Some scholars noted the consensus offered vague announcements, but limited details in implementation, others noted just comestic changes between Washington and Seoul Development consensus, hence just \\"all talk, but no walk\\". https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/development-and-g20 http://revistaestudospoliticos.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/02/Vol.5-N.1-p.74-94.pdf See also *Bretton Woods system *Beijing Consensus *Mumbai Consensus Notes and references External links *Update on Knowledge Sharing Pillar from G20 steering group's May 2011 Mexico meeting. *Info on Second G20 Development Working Group Meeting, Cape Town.

Cardozo (born June 28, 1941) is an American lawyer. From 2002 through the end of 2013, he was the Corporation Counsel for the Government of New York City, New York (a position appointed by the mayor). Cardozo is a partner at the law firm Proskauer Rose, and a former president of the New York City Bar Association. His great grandfather's first cousin was United States Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Early life and education Michael A. Cardozo was born on June 28, 1941 in New York City to Lucile and Harmon Cardozo. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963 from Brown University, located in Providence, Rhode Island, and his Juris Doctor degree in 1966 from Columbia Law School, located in New York City. After graduation, Cardozo served as a law clerk to Judge Edward C. McLean in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Career In 1967, he joined the law firm of Proskauer Rose and became a member of the Litigation Department. He became a partner in 1974 and served in that capacity until 2002 when he was appointed Corporation Counsel. While at Proskauer Cardozo was co- head of its Sports Law Practice and represented, among other clients, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer. Cardozo was elected three times to the firm's executive committee, and co-chaired its litigation department from 1987 to 1991. In January 2002, Mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed him the City's 77th Corporation Counsel, the City's chief legal officer. In that capacity he served as head of the City's 700 lawyer Law Department and as legal counsel to Mayor Bloomberg, elected officials, the City and all its agencies. He held that role for 12 years for the full 3-term tenure of the Mayor, the longest anyone has served in that capacity since the Office was created in the mid-19th century. During Cardozo's tenure the City's payout of settlement and judgments declined by 14 percent. Cardozo advised on scores of significant litigations, handling some of them himself. Under his direction, the Law Department brought successful suits concerning the illegal use of guns and the improper sale of cigarettes, and defended a major class action discrimination suit against the Fire Department, numerous challenges to the health care initiatives of Mayor Bloomberg, and steps taken in connection with the Occupy Wall Street and Republican National Convention demonstrations. Among the cases Cardozo personally successfully argued was a real estate tax dispute with the government of India in the U.S. Supreme Court, and a $2.5 billion bond case in the New York Court of Appeals. In 2014, Cardozo returned to Proskauer where he is a senior litigation partner handling commercial litigations of all types and suits against New York City, New Jersey and Florida. He also successfully represented long time felon Judith Clark, the get-a-way driver in the infamous Brinks robbery, in seeking parole after having served 39 years in prison. =Civic involvement= Long active in civic affairs Cardozo presently serves as Chair of the New York State Commission on Legislative, Judicial and Executive Compensation. He is also a member of the Board of Citizens' Union and Sanctuary for Families and is a member of the Advisory Board of Legal Outreach. He was president of the New York City Bar Association from 1996 to 1998. He also previously served as Chair of the Columbia Law School Board of Visitors and the Fund for Modern Courts, a non-partisan citizen organization devoted to improving New York State courts. He also previously chaired two court-system task forces appointed by New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler. Among the honors Cardozo has received are: the American Lawyer Lifetime Achievement Award, the Citizens Union Public Service Award, the New York Urban League Frederick Douglas Medallion for Leadership and Service, the Federal Bar Council’s Emory Buckner Award for Outstanding Public Service, the Columbia Law School Lawrence Wien Prize for Social Responsibility, the Anti-Defamation League's Human Relations Award, the Fund for Modern Courts' Cyrus R. Vance Tribute for Dedicated Work Towards Judicial Reform, the George A. Katz Torch of Learning Award from American Friends of Hebrew University; the New York Law Journal’s Impact Award and The Fund for Modern Courts Career Public Service Award. Personal life He married the former Nancy Caryn Cogut in Roslyn, New York on June 20, 1965. They have two children: Hedy (born November 9, 1967 who is married to Michael N. Rosenblut) and Sheryl (born December 25, 1970 who is married to Adi Diner).

They were usually made of a decorative wood and sometimes had special designs so as to conceal them from the casual observer. They were found in pubs, taverns, and homes of the wealthy. History Wood box containers as freestanding alcoholic beverage cabinets first appeared in Europe in the fifteenth century to hold and secure alcoholic beverages in public houses. Cellarettes first appeared in colonial America in the eighteenth century as a form of the European liquor cabinet. The main purpose of a liquor cabinet or cellarette was to secure wine and whiskey from theft as the bottles were hidden and the cabinet could have a lock. During the American Revolutionary War and the Civil War army officers' cellarettes often came with crystal decanters, shot glasses, pitchers, funnels, and drinking goblets. Eighteenth century cellarette designs were used into the twentieth century. Cellarettes of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries were found in taverns and pubs and, in some cases, in the private homes of the elite. Prohibition in the United States brought about variations of trompe l'oeil cellarettes designed to conceal illegal alcoholic beverages. To the casual observer, the three dimensional trompe l'oeil artwork on these cellarettes made them appear to be an ordinary table, bookcase, or other piece of furniture.  Description  Cellarettes in England and America were custom designed wooden chests to carry, transport and store small numbers of bottled alcoholic beverages. They were often made of fine decorative wood like mahogany, rosewood, or walnut and could be of various shapes and sizes. Cellarettes were generally associated with dining room furniture. Sometimes cellarettes were small portable pieces of furniture with handles that could be moved from room to room in a house. Another type was a permanent piece of furniture built on a stand with a sliding shelf to hold glasses and a drawer for serving paraphernalia. They could be free standing or built into a \\"pedestal-end\\" dining room buffet serving sideboard. Normally a cellarette had a hinged door or hinged top cover. Frequently a lock was provided, to secure the contents from thieves. Some cellarettes were lined internally with metal. This allowed wine or food to be iced keeping them longer than if they were at room temperature. The metal also prevented melted ice water from soaking into the wood. Men of wealth had as many as three cellarettes at a time as a status symbol, not necessarily indicating one was a heavy drinker. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries, cellarettes were typically simple in design, following a Neoclassical aesthetic. Eventually, as Neoclassicism gave way to the more ostentatious Empire style, cellarettes became heavier and more ornate, emphasizing Roman and Grecian motifs. Some examples were made in the shape of sarcophagi mounted with lions' heads and animal-paw feet. Cellarette use declined in the 20th century due to the use of the refrigerator. Etymology and term origin When the word cellarette is broken apart as \\"cellar-ette\\" it denotes a small piece of furniture used to store bottles of alcoholic beverages. It is associated with a food serving sideboard used in a formal dining room area of a home. Some sources say that the word \\"cellarette\\" came into use during the eighteenth century at the time of cabinetmaker George Hepplewhite. In Hepplewhite's 1794 The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide he demonstrates cellarettes as being octagonal and elliptical shaped with internal compartments for bottles of wine and liquor. Renowned eighteenth century Charleston, South Carolina, furniture craftsman Thomas Elfe made several \\"Mahogany Cases for bottles with brass handles\\" for £12. In 1803, furniture designer Thomas Sheraton described the piece as: \\"Cellaret, amongst cabinet makers, denotes a convenience for wine, or wine cistern. In the eighteenth century a cellarette was sometimes referred to as a \\"Mahogany Butler for liquors\\" or a \\"wine cooler\\" or a \\"butler\\". The word bouteillier/butler was later standardized as a reference to the staff person exercising custodial responsibility over the bottles contained in a cellarette or wine cellar.

The Ferdowsi millennial was held at the initiative of Reza Shah Pahlavi and was announced at the beginning of the year by the government of Iran. The Millennial Congress convened for five days, from 2 to 6 October 1934, in Tehran, and more than eighty notable European and Iranian scholars attended the congress. The celebrations lasted for nearly a month. Various official ceremonies were held simultaneously in a number of European countries including France, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, in universities, clubs, and embassies. Also, a number of other countries, including the United States, Egypt and Iraq, held festivities.  Participants in the Millennial Congress  Reza Shah Pahlavi officially dedicating the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting at the conclusion of the Ferdowi millennial conference The gathering in Tehran and Mashad of about a hundred distinguished scholars as well as many dignitaries of various nationalities was a most beneficial event for Iranian studies in general and for research on Ferdowsi and the Shahnameh in particular. Distinguished participants included: Henri Massé (France), Vladimir Minorsky (England), Sebastian Beck (Germany), Evgeniĭ Berthels (Soviet Union), Georges Contenau (France), Arthur Christensen (Denmark), Friedrich Sarre (Germany), Denison Ross (England), A.A.

The final event of the celebrations was the inauguration of the new building for the mausoleum of Ferdowsi in Tous, by the congress participants, with the presence of Reza Shah Pahlavi.  Scholarly publications related to the millennial  An important outcome of the Ferdowsi millennial was the publication of a large number of scholarly works dedicated to the study of Ferdowsi and the Shahnameh, notably: * Mohammad Ramazani published the Shahnameh (based on Macan's edition) a year before the millennial (Tehran, in five volumes). * Sayf Azad edited and published the Shahnameh and illustrated it with pictures of ancient kings inspired by Achaemenid and Sasanian sculptures (4 vols., Berlin, 1934–1935). * Henri Massé's Firdausi et l'épopée nationale (Paris, 1934) * Mohammad-Taqi Bahar's collected articles on Ferdowsi's life and works and the chronology of the Shahnameh, in a special issue of Bāḵtar monthly (Isfahan, 1934) * A collection of papers presented by various Persian scholars to the congress in Ferdowsī- nāma-ye Mehr (Tehran, 1934) * A collection by Armenian scholars in Yerevan under the title Firdusi Žolovacus (Ferdowsī celebration) * A collection by Soviet scholars titled Ferdovsi (Moscow, 1934) * Firdausi Celebration (New York, 1934), a collection of articles that included a catalog of the principal manuscripts of the Shahnameh then known. * The 1935 volume of the French periodical Journal Asiatique, devoted to Ferdowsi * A special commemorative issue of Īrān-e Bāstān (Berlin, 1936) by Sayf Āzād. * A collection of 33 papers read by the participants in the congress, under the title Ketāb-e hazāra-ye Ferdowsī (Tehran, 1943) One of the first tickets sold for the celebration clearly shows the layering structure of the tomb  Impact of the Ferdowsi millennial on Iranian Studies  Tus Several participants of the congress expressed the opinion that the greatest service that the scholarly world could render to the Persian-speaking people would be the publication of a critical and reliable edition of the Shahnameh. The Borūḵīm Publishing House in Tehran tried to address this issue and published the complete text of the Šāh-nāma, based on the Vullers edition under the supervision of Mojtaba Minovi, Abbas Eqbal, Solayman Haïm and Said Nafisi. Fritz Wolff made a lasting contribution with the publication of his glossary of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh (Glossar zu Ferdosis Schahname), which was presented as a gift to the Persian people by the German ambassador on the first day of the congress. These contributions greatly advanced Iranian scholarship, and led to the appearance of a number of monumental scholarly works on Ferdowsi and the Shahnameh in subsequent decades.

He became a popular performer of lusty seaside songs and originated the J. Glover-Kind classic, \\"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\\" in 1909. He recorded more than fifty songs during a ten-year period, including \\"One of the Bhoys\\" (1910), \\"Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser\\" (1914) and \\"I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare\\" (1915). He was also a major presence in pantomime productions throughout the British Isles during his later career. Sheridan was born in Hendon, Sunderland, County Durham, and initially worked on the Sunderland docks before being employed at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Theatre, where he took up amateur dramatics. To progress his stage career, he secured engagements in Europe and South Africa in 1890, and performed in Australia two years later. In 1895 he returned to London and entered the vibrant scene of English music hall and became a leading performer on the circuit. In 1909 he first performed what was to become his most famous song \\"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\\", which he later recorded. In 1917, Sheridan wrote and composed the musical burlesque, Gay Paree, which he performed with a London theatre company and later toured the northern provinces including Scotland. His career took a decline in later years and he suffered severe depression, as a result. He committed suicide in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow in 1918 aged 53.

He progressed from there to working in the back offices of the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Theatre for four years between 1877–1881.Mellor, p. 90 There, he became interested in performing and took up amateur dramatics. Sheridan decided to shorten his name to Fred as was a popular name on the music hall circuit.Mark Sheridan Laing, Allan The Caledonian Mercury, The Caledonian Press online edition, 20 March 2010, accessed 12 December 2011 He later changed his name again when he moved from amateur dramatics to the professional theatre and decided upon Mark Sheridan. He took the first name from the American writer and humorist Mark Twain and used his Irish mother's maiden surname, Sheridan.\\"Mark Sheridan's Military Songs\\", The Era, 14 October 1914, p. 7 His early experiences in variety shows were mainly in Europe, followed by performances in South Africa in 1890, where he went after his marriage to Ethel Maude DavenportEngland & Wales Marriages 1837-2005, Vol. 1D, Page 768.. Two years later, he travelled to Australia and appeared on the Harry Rickards circuit, where he started a double act with his wife called \\"The Sheridans\\". He arrived back in London with his wife in 1895 but dissolved the double act with her. He was engaged to appear at the Standard Music Hall, Pimlico, the same year. From there he became a regular on the London music hall circuit, and quickly built up a reputation as one of the most popular music hall comedians of the time. Sheridan made frequent appearances on the same bill as Marie Lloyd, Little Tich, Dan Leno and George Robey. As well as his comedy sketches, he became a successful singer and enjoyed his biggest success in 1909 with \\"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\\". This led to performances as a principal boy in countless pantomimes across the country and further recordings, including \\"One of the Bhoys\\" (1910), \\"Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser\\" (1914), \\"Here We Are Again\\" (1914) and \\"I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare\\" (1915). =Later career and death= In 1915, Sheridan starred in the comic revue Winkles,\\"Mark Sheridan in his Latest Success\\", Western Daily Press, 18 October 1915, p. 7 which later toured the northern provinces.\\"Bristol Hippodrome Twice Nightly\\", Western Daily Press, 15 September 1916, p. 4 As music hall was on the decline with audiences, Sheridan concentrated on revue.

In 1917, Sheridan returned to Glasgow where he had enjoyed some of his earliest successes. He wrote and personally financed Gay Paree, a musical burlesque show based on W. G.

It was broadcast on 19 November 2010 as part of children's charity Children in Need's 2010 telethon on BBC One. Written by Daran Little, it stars several actors from both television shows, and depicts humorous encounters between their characters. Plot Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver), Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) greet Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) and Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) as they arrive in Weatherfield (in Greater Manchester) from Walford (in Greater London). Sean takes an immediate liking to Christian, while Zainab and Sunita argue about Asian accents and dress. Jodie is unable to walk on Coronation Street's cobbles in her high heels. Sean flirts with Christian and invites him out clubbing, but Christian says he has a boyfriend who he loves. Sunita, Hayley and Jane talk about life in their respective boroughs, saying that they are similar as nothing out of the ordinary ever happens. They say that Weatherfield and Walford would therefore be perfect for town twinning. Eileen invites Zainab into her home and Zainab is shocked to learn that Eileen has a gay son and a gay lodger, so she hurries out, and walks into the door frame. This scene can also be seen as a precursor to the December 2010 tram crash, as when the house shakes and Zainab asks what that was, Eileen says \\"Oh it was the tram - I've always said they'll be the death of me!\\" Meanwhile, Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) take photos of Albert Square. Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) wolf whistles at Michelle and points out a ladder in her tights. Dev goes off for a business meeting, while Michelle meets Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and recognises him from a 2007 holiday in Spain. Inside The Queen Victoria, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) cannot understand Jason Grimshaw's (Ryan Thomas) accent, so Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) serves him. Jason sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) and they are attracted to each other. Kat tells Liz her skirt is too short after measuring it. Dev meets Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) in the Minute Mart shop where they talk about business and Asian stereotypes. When they part ways, Dev makes a call saying the shop is perfect, while Masood makes one saying Dev has fallen for his ruse. Kat is unhappy that her husband Alfie is talking to Michelle. Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) meets Denise Fox (Diane Parish) in Walford's café and asks if Denise is married. Denise says her husband is in prison for murdering her ex-husband. Gail says her husband killed his ex-wife and their neighbour. Denise says hers also killed his ex-wife, and then took her to the canal. Gail says hers drove her and her family into a canal. Denise says hers locked her in a basement, so Gail says it does not compare to being in prison, to which Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) says Gail is the winner. Michelle and Alfie sing karaoke but are stopped by Kat, who tells Michelle to get out of her pub. She then sees a charm on Liz's bracelet and asks her to explain it. Liz says she gave up a child for adoption and made charms out of two nappy pins, one which she kept and one which she gave to the adoptive parents to give to her daughter when she turned 18. Liz says they probably did not do that, but Kat says maybe they did, revealing an identical charm. Kat insists Liz is not her mother, but Liz says she is (as a reference to the majorly recognised Kat and Zoe cliffhanger from 2001). Background The crossover was announced on 8 November 2010 as part of the BBC One telethon for the children's charity Children in Need. It is the first time characters from both shows come face- to-face, and takes place on the sets of both programmes, including the Rovers Return Inn and The Queen Victoria public houses. EastEnders cast who took part in the mini-episode were Laurie Brett (Jane), Charlie G. Hawkins (Darren), Kylie Babbington (Jodie), Nina Wadia (Zainab), John Partridge (Christian), Diane Parish (Denise), Jessie Wallace (Kat), Shane Richie (Alfie), Ricky Norwood (Fatboy), Nitin Ganatra (Masood), Shona McGarty (Whitney) and Jamie Borthwick (Jay). The stars from Coronation Street who appear are Sue Cleaver (Eileen), Antony Cotton (Sean), Julie Hesmondhalgh (Hayley), Shobna Gulati (Sunita), Beverley Callard (Liz), Kym Marsh (Michelle), Helen Worth (Gail), Jimmi Harkishin (Dev) and Ryan Thomas (Jason). Callard, Marsh, Worth, Harkishin and Thomas visited the EastEnders set, Partridge, Hawkins, Brett, Wadia and Babbington visited the Coronation Street set, while the other cast members remained on their respective usual sets. Cast reactions On filming on the EastEnders set, Callard said, \\"I've visited the EastEnders set many years ago but this is the first time I've worked on it and it was great. We've had a great time and the script is so funny. It's so good.\\" Parish added: \\"It's been an honour and a pleasure. I think they should do more of it actually. It's been a lot of fun and I was slightly nervous but very honoured to be working with Helen Worth. I think she's lovely and I've always loved her character.\\" Marsh opined: \\"It's been such fun. That's the one word I can honestly say and it's been very funny. Of all the soaps, we're the two that don't really see each other that much or get to mingle, probably because of the distance and all the rivalry stuff that people make up. So it's nice to show that we do get on and it's been a pleasure.\\" Richie said filming with Coronation Street stars on the Albert Square set was \\"very surreal\\", adding \\"I loved watching their reactions when I showed them round the Square. And seeing Bev [Callard] and Jessie [Wallace] behind the bar was strange.\\" Hesmondhalgh said the experience was exciting but nerve-wracking, and said her character Hayley probably has a crush on Christian when they meet. Wadia joked that the Coronation Street cast were slightly arrogant and obnoxious, while Cleaver said it was as if the EastEnders cast had been on the Coronation Street set forever. Babbington was also excited and said she had fun, and Worth was also very nervous. Borthwick thought the crossover was something that should have been done a long time ago. Norwood said the scene between Kat and Liz was nice because of the similarities between the characters. A month after the broadcast of \\"East Street\\", Callard, who later departed from Coronation Street in 2011, said she loved filming the scenes with Wallace and they could not stop laughing. She added that she would love to play Kat's mother in EastEnders for real. Reception Before airing, Mark Jefferies from the Daily Mirror called the episode \\"bizarre\\". Andy Welch for AOL Television said, \\"They might be fierce rivals when it comes to ratings and awards, but it's nice to see Coronation Street and EastEnders can bury the hatchet for a good cause.\\" Katie Byrne from the Evening Herald said the episode was \\"comedy gold\\" and the best moment of the entire telethon, adding that the conversation between Gail and Denise was the funniest scene, as it poked fun of the soaps' often similar storylines, and praising the cast and writers for parodying soap stereotypes, exaggerating storylines and poking fun at themselves. Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror said the crossover was \\"kind of excruciating.\\" In her review of soap operas in the second half of 2010, Ruth Deller from lowculture.co.uk said that \\"East Street\\" deserved a special mention as it was \\"great fun, especially the evil husband top trumps scene.\\" See also *List of EastEnders television spin-offs *Coronation Street § Crossovers References External links * Category:Coronation Street spin-offs Category:EastEnders spin-offs Category:Children in Need Category:2010 British television episodes Category:Crossover television ","title":"East Street (Children in Need)"},{"id":"29638044","text":"2010 NERFU College Men's Division III Rugby Tournament The 2010 NERFU College Men's Division III Rugby Tournament featured the top 8 Division III college rugby teams out of 32 competitors from the four NERFU sub-conferences (North, South, Central, West).

Plot Donald Wilson tries to make a living in New York with different jobs. He reads detective novels all the time, so that his distraction causes him to have various misadventures that repeatedly cost him his jobs. A notice on a notice board draws his attention to the detective training of Paul Miller, whose school he attends. The school is located in a run-down house and the owner Paul has all kinds of debts with various creditors. Instead of getting a decent education, Donald is the only detective candidate at the school, is financially exploited and has to take part in Paul's fraudulent actions to reduce his debts. Both of them accidentally get into conflict with three Italian cheese-making families, the Lombardis, the Zanettis and the Falcones. They discover Caterina Zanetti, the woman who was kidnapped by the Falcones, the woman Carlo Lombardi actually wanted to marry. Carlo has been told in a fake letter that Caterina has fallen in love with another man. The Falcones now want to marry him to Sonia Falcone in order to maintain their position in the Italian cheese market. Caterina can give the two unsuspecting Americans a message to deliver to their cousin Mario Zanetti at the airport so that the wedding can be stopped. Paul and Donald drive to the airport, have to steal two passports to follow Mario Zanetti on the plane. Since they are being followed by the Falcones, they have to fly to Rome, for better or worse. On the flight Mario is poisoned, so the two of them have to deliver the message. Since Donald lost his wallet when Mario was murdered, he now also becomes a suspect in a murder case. In their search for Carlo, Paul and Donald are constantly exposed to persecution by their families, so that they are constantly on the run and have to disguise themselves as monks, for example in the Vatican. In spite of everything, they manage to get the message across to Carlo that Caterina still loves him. Carlo wants to cancel the wedding with Sonia, who looks \\"like a beaver\\", but is blackmailed with the killing of Caterina if he does not marry Sonia. He could see Caterina in Venice one last time, but would have to marry Sonia. In contrast to Paul, Donald still wants to prevent the wedding. After a short stopover in Pisa, they drive to Venice for the planned wedding. After Carlo and Caterina meet on a canal, Paul manages to free Caterina, while Donald is able to tie up the supposed bride Sonia. They exchange the bride and only when the veil is lifted does Carlo face his beloved Caterina. The families draw their weapons, but see the event in the church as a sign from God, so that the wedding continues. A reward of 25,000 dollars is refused by Paul, as he is allowed to keep what he considers a valuable pendant. Back in New York the two want to sell the pendant and it turns out that it is actually worth 300,000. However, it is not dollars, but Italian lira, so the total amount is not even 175 dollars.

It is noted for its low-budget production values, cheesy '80's synth soundtrack, and being the only film released from the Cannon Group to have lost money at the box office. However, it is also representative of '80 culture at the time when slapstick briefly resurfaced in popularity with American audiences.

Expedition to British East Africa 1896 In 1895, a claimant to the chieftainship of Takaungu in British East African Protectorate rebelled against British authority. This led to widespread disturbances in the districts of Wanga, Mombasa and Malindi (in modern Kenya). In March 1896, the 24th (Baluchistan) (Duchess of Connaught's Own) Regiment of Bombay Infantry (now 6th Battalion The Baloch Regiment of Pakistan Army) under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Astley Pearson was ordered to Mombasa to restore order. The rebellion was soon brought under control by occupation of food centres and relentless pursuit of insurgents by battalion columns. In July 1896, the 24th Baluchistan Infantry returned to Quetta. For its services in the campaign, the battalion was awarded the Battle Honour of 'British East Africa 1896' in 1901. The Battle Honour is unique to this unit. In 1922, when the Regimental Group System was adopted by the British Indian Army, the battalion was redesignated as the 1st Battalion (Duchess of Connaught's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment, and the Battle Honour was extended to all the battalions of 10th Baluch Regiment.Chaldecott, Lt Col OA.

The basic feature of the scam involves diagnosing the victim (the \\"mark\\") with some sort of secret problem that only the grifter can detect or diagnose, and then charging the mark for ineffectual treatments. The archetypical grifter working the scam is a fortune teller who announces that the mark is suffering from a curse that her magic can relieve, while threatening dire consequences if the curse is not lifted.Illinois State Police, Common Citizen Scams, accessed Nov. 17, 2010People v. Bertsche, 265 Ill. 272, 106 N.E. 823 (Ill. 1914) Method In this scam, a fortune teller uses her cold reading skill to detect that a client is genuinely troubled rather than merely seeking entertainment; or is a gambler complaining of bad luck. The fortune teller informs the mark that they are the victim of a curse, but that for a fee a spell can be cast to remove the curse. In Romany, this trick is called bujo, originally meaning simply \\"bag\\", but now meaning \\"a swindle involving a large amount of money from a gullible fortune-telling customer.\\"Anne Sutherland, in Gypsies, Tinkers, and Other Travellers (Academic Press, 1975) This name comes from a traditional form: the mark is told that the curse is in their money; they bring money in a bag to have the spell cast over it, and leave with a bag of worthless paper;See, e.g., Marks v. State, 144 Tex.Crim. 509, 164 S.W.2d 690 (Tex.Crim.App. 1942) or money or property are given to the fortune teller to be destroyed as bearing the curse, and an item of lesser value is swapped and conspicuously destroyed instead.W. W. Zellner, William M. Kephart, Extraordinary groups: an examination of unconventional lifestyles (Macmillan, 2000; ), pp. 121-122 In some cases the curse is \\"verified\\" by a sleight of hand trick, often involving an egg. The grifter tells the mark to bring an egg to a reading,Sylvia Browne, Lindsay Harrison, The Truth About Psychics: What's Real, What's Not, and How to Tell the Difference (Simon and Schuster, 2009; ), pp. 230-321 which when cracked open reveals disgusting matter or symbols of evil. This discovery confirms the curse.Illinois State Police, aboveSkip Hollandsworth, \\"The Curse of Romeo and Juliet\\", Texas Monthly, June 1997 Incidents These scams continue into the present day. A 1996 reported decision out of Hawaii described the scam as \\"a centuries old confidence game that victimized the elderly or those with emotional problems\\", describing its operation in this manner: A Texas woman was sentenced to 2 years on Federal charges for wire fraud and money laundering after she operated a scam involving a psychic telephone line.

The dictatorship has been the subject of much controversy due to its violations of human rights, use of torture, and the unexplained disappearances of many Uruguayans. The term \\"civic-military\\" refers to the military regime's relatively gradual usurpation of power from civilian presidents who continued to serve as head of state, which distinguished it from dictatorships in other South American countries in which senior military officers immediately seized power and directly served as head of state. The dictatorship was the culmination of an escalation of violence and authoritarianism in a traditionally peaceful and democratic country, and existed within the context of other military dictatorships in the region. It resulted in the suppression of all former political activity, including the traditional political parties. Many people were imprisoned and tortured, especially Uruguayans with left-wing sympathies. Political situation in Uruguay The slow road to dictatorship started in the late 1960s. Between 1952 and 1967, the country experimented with a collective presidency. The National Council of Government had nine members, six from the majority party and three from the opposition. It provided weak leadership in the midst of a worsening economic situation. After the re-establishment of the Presidency, the new President Óscar Diego Gestido was unable to improve economic conditions. He died in December 1967, six months after taking office. His constitutional successor, President Jorge Pacheco Areco (1967–1972) banned the Socialist Party of Uruguay, other leftist organizations and their newspapers, purged liberal professors from universities, and suppressed labor unions. His repressive politics as well as the crisis in economy and high inflation fueled social conflict and far-left guerrilla activity; the latter of which manifested in the form of the Tupamaros. On June 13, 1968, Pacheco declared a state of emergency. In between a far-right student organization was born, the Juventud Uruguaya de Pie. More states of emergency were declared in August 1970, after Tupamaros killed US security expert Dan Mitrione, and in January 1971, when they kidnapped UK ambassador Geoffrey Jackson. When more than 100 Tupamaros escaped from jail, on September 9, 1971, Pacheco ordered the army to suppress all guerrilla activities.Pachequism, 1967-72 To coordinate their anti-guerrilla actions, the armed forces created Junta de Comandates en Jefe which was the first military coordination body independent of the usual Ministry of Defense oversight. Later, it evolved into Estado Mayour Conjunto (ESMACO).Bounded Missions: Military Regimes and Democratization in the Southern Cone Between 1968 and 1971, expenses on military doubled from 13.3% of the budget to 26.2% while expenses on education fell from 24.3% to 16%.Latin American Dictators of the 20th Century: The Lives and Regimes of 15 Rulers In November 1971, general elections were held. In response to Pacheco's effort to change the constitution and to run for re-election, leftist parties created Broad Front. In the controversial election, Wilson Ferreira Aldunate won more votes than Pacheco's handpicked successor, Juan María Bordaberry from the Colorado Party.NIXON: \\"BRAZIL HELPED RIG THE URUGUAYAN ELECTIONS,\\" 1971 However, owing to the Ley de Lemas multi-candidate system, Bordaberry became president when Colorado candidates received a combined 12,800 more votes than the combined vote of Ferreira's National Party. Immediately, Bordaberry was perceived as a weak president. Bordaberry presidency: 1972-1973 After becoming president on March 1, 1972, the inexperienced Bordaberry had to concentrate on fighting Tupamaros and chose to continue Pacheco's repressive policies. On April 15, 1972, he declared a state of \\"internal war\\" and suspended civil liberties. That was then extended by the National Assembly in September 1972, November 1972, and March 1973. On July 10, 1972, a new State Security law came into force and allowed political prisoners to be tried in military courts. Army officers assumed more responsibilities in government. By the end of the year, the army had effectively destroyed the Tupamaros and their leader, Raúl Sendic, was imprisoned. Most of the Tupamaro leaders spent 12 years in prison and later became prominent politicians. Torture was effectively used to gather information needed to break up the Tupamaros and against trade union activists, members of the Communist Party of Uruguay and even regular citizens. On June 22, 1972, the National Assembly decided to investigate allegations of torture and human-rights violations by military. In response, the military refused to cooperate with this investigation and persuaded Bordaberry to establish a joint military commission that would investigate corruption by politicians. Coup of 1973 During the few years when it was granted extraordinary powers, the Uruguayan military had acquired a taste for political power and began to behave independently of the civilian authorities. In late 1972, Bordaberry tried to limit the military's political powers. In an October 19, 1972 meeting with military chiefs, Bordaberry was presented with an eight-point program in which the military demanded the immovability of commanding officers, military participation in state enterprises, independence of military corruption investigation, and military control over police. On February 8, 1973, Bordaberry tried to assert his authority over the military and appointed a retired general, Antonio Francese, as the new Minister of National Defense. The Navy initially supported the appointment while the Army and Air Force commanders rejected it outright and on February 9 and 10 issued public proclamations in which they demanded radical changes in the country's political and economic system. They promised to end unemployment, support local industry, eliminate corruption, implement land reform and end all terrorism. Bordaberry bowed to the pressure, and on February 12, in the Air Force headquarters, concluded an agreement with the armed force commanders to provide for their involvement in politics in advisory role. A new National Security Council (COSENA) was created, consisting of Army, Air Force and Navy commanders as well as ministers of National Defense, Interior, Economics and Foreign Affairs. From now on, they effectively were in control of the country. Bordaberry had saved his post by participating in a self-coup. Presidents * Juan María Bordaberry (1973–1976), democratically elected and later removed. * Alberto Demicheli (1976), appointed and removed. * Aparicio Méndez (1976–1981), appointed. * Gregorio Álvarez (1981–1985), appointed. Dictatorship Uruguay's democratically elected Parliament continued working until June 27, 1973, when it was dismissed for resisting the military regime. Bordaberry created a new Council of State and put the military in control over civilian life. The new dictatorship was inspired by Brazilian military government, which said that the Cold War allowed all means to defeat the Left and Communists. The COSENA was the de facto governing body, meeting every week and approving policies while the JOG (Junta de Oficiales Generales) was the source of the power. By 1977, it consisted of 28 members mostly army generals, air force brigadiers and navy admirals. To secure its rule, on December 6, 1976, a new Council of the Nation was created by uniting the Council of the State and the JOG. The regime's promises to improve the economy were dashed by the global crisis caused by the 1973 oil crisis. Uruguay started borrowing money from international lenders, chiefly from the US. Opening of the small local economy to global corporations and financial institutions ruined local Uruguayan companies, who could no longer compete. The regime was forced to borrow even more and cut budget expenditures. By 1981, the country of 3 million people owed US$4 billion. Bordaberry, whose political career was notable for opportunism, gradually became even more authoritarian than the military commanders. In June 1976, he proposed a new, corporatist constitution that would have permanently shuttered the parties and codified a permanent role for the military. This was further than even the military wanted to go, and it forced him to resign.Juan María Bordaberry obituary He was succeeded by Alberto Demicheli a Colorado and head of the Council of State who, while a relative liberal among the ruling group, canceled the elections that were supposed to take place in 1976. However, he refused to sign a law removing political rights of thousands of politicians. In his place, on September 1, 1976, a senior politician, Aparicio Méndez of the National Party, was appointed president. The Minister of Economy and Finance, Alejandro Végh Villegas, tried to improve economy by promoting the finance sector and foreign investment. Social spending was cut, with many state companies privatized. However, after 1980, the economy deteriorated, GDP fell by 20% and unemployment rose to 17%. The state stepped in and bailed out many collapsing businesses and banks. The failure of the regime to improve the economy further weakened its position.The Military's Economic Record In August 1977, the armed forces announced its plan for reorganizing Uruguayan democracy. Only two traditional parties, the Blancos and Colorados, were to exist, and the president would be elected from a single, pre-approved candidate. In 1980, the regime put its plan to the voters via a referendum. In a shock to the regime, 57.2% of voters voted against the proposal. The vote marked the start of negotiated return to democracy. The military's belief that it needed to legitimize their proposed constitution by holding an actual referendum, as opposed to simply falsifying the voting results, was itself an indication that democracy was not quite dead yet in Uruguay. On September 1, 1981, General Gregorio Conrado Álvarez, who was secretary of the National Security Council since 1973 and Commander-in-Chief of Uruguayan Armed forces from 1978 to 1979, assumed the presidency. He began negotiations with civilian politicians about returning power to elected officials. On June 7, 1982, a law allowed the traditional political parties (Blancos, Colorados, and Civic Union Party) to resume their activities, but leftist parties remained banned. On November 28, elections were held to elect representatives to political party conventions, which then were expected to select new leaders, who then would be allowed to participate in the presidential elections of 1984.Uruguay: voters cast ballots for 'end to military dictatorship' In 1983, workers and labor unions were allowed to demonstrate on May 1. From May to July 1983, political parties and military officers held negotiations in Park Hotel without any results. On November 27, 1983, a massive street demonstration was allowed in Montevideo with approximately 500,000 people participating. Return to democracy, 1984-1985 In 1984, there were strikes against the regime and in support of political prisoners. On January 13, 1984, the first 24-hour general strike since 1973 was organized. Talks between military leadership and civilian politicians intensified despite the fact that several political leaders were still notable, such as Wilson Ferreira Aldunate. On August 3, 1984, the Naval Club Pact was signed and restored the constitution of 1967 and allowed the military to advise in security matters and control appointments of senior officers. The military also received blanket amnesty for human rights violations.Pact of the Naval Club On November 25, 1984, elections were held, and following the brief presidency of Rafael Addiego Bruno, on March 1, 1985, Colorado Party candidate Julio Maria Sanguinetti became the new president. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democratization following the country's years under military rule. Nonetheless, Sanguinetti never supported the human rights violations accusations, and his government did not prosecute the military officials who engaged in repression and torture against either the Tupamaros or the MLN. Instead, he opted for signing an amnesty treaty, called in Spanish \\"Ley de Amnistía.\\" Oppression and emigration Uruguay's disappeared people During the dictatorship, more than 5000 people were arrested for political reasons and almost 10% of Uruguayans emigrated from the country. Torture extended until the end of Uruguayan dictatorship in 1985. Uruguay had the highest number per capita of political prisoners in the world. Almost 20% of population were arrested for shorter or longer periods. MLN heads were isolated in prisons and subjected to repeated acts of torture. Emigration from Uruguay rose drastically, as large numbers of Uruguayans looked for political asylum throughout the world. Around 180 Uruguayans are known to have been killed during the 12-year military rule from 1973 to 1985. Most were killed in Argentina and other neighbouring countries, with only 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay. Many of those killed were never found, and the missing people have been referred to as the \\"disappeared\\", or \\"desaparecidos\\" in Spanish. The Museo de la Memoria, in Montevideo, commemorates those who were murdered or disappeared under the regime.  Censorship  = Media and literature = During the years of the dictatorship, censorship was heavily placed on Uruguayan people. Censorship was being institutionalized by the government, infiltrated into every corner of society. Since 1976, the government started implementing censorship on press media. Media constantly faced threats of closure and interrogation. News companies had to submit its journalists', editors' and staffs' names to the Ministry of Education and Culture with a clear statement of its publication objectives and financial sources. Articles or publications which intended to damage the reputation of national prestige is forbidden, especially regard to the report on Tupamaro urban guerrillas. Open information on Tupamaro needed to be drawn from government sources. At the same time, censorship on literature works reached to the strictest level in Uruguayan history. The numbers of professional writers were detained by the government exceeded any previous period in the history. The illiberal political environment forced many influential writers to move out of the country to publish their works. Mario Benedetti, the most prominent Uruguayan novelist, lived in exile in Peru, Cuba and Spain. He wrote considerable influential novels to criticize the strict censorship under the Civic-Military dictatorship, calling for a non-violent opposition in the country. = Music and radio = As the written works became increasingly hard to get published, writers turned articles into songs. As the consequence, the regime started carrying out more censoring measures on music and radio station. The government did not send out an official public announcement on banning music and broadcasting. However, music and radio stations sensed increasing pressure from the government. The radio station began with receiving police notice if they broadcast sensitive songs. Then the music and radio station started self-censorship when some representative composers or music station's staffs were sentenced by the government. The arrest of songwriters forced other performers of protest songs to leave the country and radio stations stopped broadcasting any music due to social conformity. = Education = Apart from censoring intellectual works, the government under Civic-Military dictatorship attempted to restructure the national educational system for the goal of prioritizing \\"moral and civic education\\". In 1969, Professor Acosta y Lara took the Secondary Education Council under control. He had a tight political alliance with the regime, who actively attack students' dissents. In 1972, the controversial General Education law passed, which eliminated autonomy of education councils. Since then, staffs from the Education council started patrolling schools and wearing armbands. Security personnel from the Education council strictly monitored student activities and class discussions. Moreover, the state imposed stringent syllabus, censored textbook and evaluated students' performance based on their ideological attachment to the regime. A computerized system allocated a letter of designation of democratic faith (A, B or C) to people according to their levels of ideological loyalty. After the return to democracy, Uruguayan people are calling for establishing June 27 as a national day to memorialize this silent and dark history in their country. Uruguayan people hope that through the establishment of the national day can re-emphasize their commitment to truth, justice and transparency. Aftermath The legacy of the dictatorship still gives rise to debate and controversy. In the conversations that led to the Naval Club Pact, the idea was floated that the military would release its power on the condition that those involved would not be prosecuted for their actions during the dictatorship. Many considered it unacceptable, but a political crisis that eventually menaced Uruguay's relatively fragile new democratic government during the redemocratization process led to the controversial enactment in 1986 of the Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State (), which is still in force: in 1989 and 2009, Uruguayans voted in referendum twice to keep the law, which detractors consider to be plain impunity.

The Los Angeles Times reported the man, a convicted felon named Harold Martin Smith, was approached by police in the apartment lobby, at which point he pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the head.LA Times article: \\"Suspect in Ronni Chasen slaying had been under police surveillance before he killed himself.\\" On December 6, 2010 it was reported that the man was no longer considered a person of interest in the murder. However, on December 8, 2010 the Beverly Hills Police Department declared its preliminary conclusion that Chasen's murder had been a random act of violence, a robbery attempt turned violent. According to the police, the gun the suspect used to kill himself was the same one used to murder Chasen. Police said they believed the man acted alone and it was in no way connected with road rage – an operating theory the previous week. The big break in the case was a tip through America's Most Wanted – after the suspect began bragging to neighbors that he shot Chasen and got $10,000 for it. The AMW tipster – who wants to remain anonymous – stood to collect a $125,000 reward.

The title is based on the fictional Emerald City from the Oz Books. Nucky asks Margaret to toe the party line; Angela witnesses Jimmy's violent side; Capone faces a crossroads; Van Alden grapples with his emotions. Plot Following Nucky's assassination attempt, Richard stays at the Schroeder apartment; his scarred face and tin mask frighten the children. Sebso's false account about Winslow's attempted escape is accepted by Van Alden's boss, who gives Sebso vacation time and warns Van Alden that further mistakes will ruin his career. Jimmy is released from jail for lack of evidence; he returns home and works at reconnecting with Angela. Nucky tries to allay Margaret's apprehensions about living under guard, promising her that he has the situation well in hand. In New York, Rothstein meets with Mickey and the D'Alessio brothers. Rothstein, a calculating gambler who values the power of accurate information, rebukes the group for not doing enough research on Nucky's butler, Eddie, and for shooting an innocent civilian during the attack. When they ask how they can make it up to him, Rothstein replies, \\"Nothing says 'I'm sorry' like money.\\" In Chicago, Torrio becomes furious with Capone for interrupting a business meeting with a juvenile prank. Later, Capone follows Torrio to the bar mitzvah of an associate's son. In the synagogue, one of the congregants chats with Capone about the ceremony's significance and the responsibilities that come with manhood. Capone is deeply moved by the ceremony and apologizes to Torrio, promising to act like an adult and take on more responsibility. Torrio tasks him with fixing the distribution problems at a brewery in their territory. As the Darmodys pass the photography shop on the boardwalk on a family outing, Jimmy's son Tommy points to a picture of Robert and Mary Dittrich and calls one of them Angela's \\"kissing friend\\", referring to Mary. Misunderstanding, Jimmy storms inside and beats up Robert, prompting Angela to promise Mary she will leave Jimmy and move with Tommy and her to Paris. Margaret celebrates the passage of women's suffrage, but Nucky immediately pressures her to help rally new female voters in support of Bader. She finally gives in and makes a rousing speech in favor of Bader, but sours when she sees Nucky gladhanding with other powerful men. Margaret also invites Richard to sit while she reads the children The Road to Oz, and later admits that she was a bit frightened herself at his disfigurement. Richard replies that because he himself has not moved past judging by appearances, he can hardly expect the same of others. He also notes that he sometimes forgets the changes he has undergone, and is reminded only when he looks into a mirror. Van Alden visits Margaret and, in a plea fraught with religious and romantic overtones, demands that she let him save her from damnation for participating in Nucky's life of crime. When she rejects him, he visits a bordello, where he takes shots of whiskey and has sex with Lucy. Worried the D'Alessios will soon kill him, Mickey reveals the conspiracy to an enraged Nucky, who enlists Chalky to arrange a false deal with Lansky in the hopes of luring Rothstein's men into an ambush. When Lansky and two of the D'Alessios meet with Chalky, one of them mentions his Packard, a detail they could only know from seeing it when they killed Chalky's driver. After Chalky takes them prisoner, Nucky identifies one of the brothers as his would-be assassin; Jimmy shoots him in the head. The remaining D'Alessio promises Chalky that his surviving brothers will lynch him; Chalky strangles him with his bare hands. Seeing that the original plan is ruined, Nucky releases Lansky and demands that he tell Rothstein what has happened. Nucky returns home to Margaret, blaming his late return on a campaign strategy meeting. The episode ends with Margaret looking in the mirror, contemplating the decisions she has made.  Reception  =Critical reception= IGN gave the episode a score of 8.5 calling it \\"Great\\" and said \\"\\"I don't control anyone, Margaret,\\" Nucky says. \\"I'm more of an overseer.\\" If \\"Emerald City\\" is any indication, how Nucky observes and participates in the events of Season One's final two episodes will involve more changes and more strategic bloodshed.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B\\", describing it \\"For the first nine episodes of Boardwalk Empire, we've been getting a lot of introduction and backstory and a lot of exploration of the world of 1920, but only a little bit of forward movement on the plot that was set into motion back in episode one. Yes, we've seen Margaret blossom from an abused immigrant peasant to an increasingly assured political player and Jimmy go from being a small-time crook to a shrewd mobster, and we've seen a number of folks get shot. But we began this adventure with Nucky Thompson, Arnold Rothstein, and the agents of the United States government all at odds over the future of the booze biz, and their respective advantages haven't changed much since then. And not to be an alarmist, but after tonight's \\"The Emerald City\\", there are only two episodes remaining in the first season.\\" Expanding on that, they said \\"As mentioned, \\"The Emerald City\\" features a lot of scenes of powerful men dealing with underlings who may or may not be up to the responsibilities of their respective organizations. Even Arnold Rothstein has a rough time of it, trying to explain \\"the age of information\\" to a bunch of goons whose idea of sound business practice is to shoot a man in the street. But then that's what Boardwalk Empire is all about, isn't it? Or at least it's what keeps me fascinated by the show even when it occasionally annoys me. What is it that all these characters are engaged in: Is this business or crime?

It has been scheduled as an ancient monument. Archeological digs have uncovered the earthworks, revealing the outline of the construction, which is still visible, with the banking reaching 25 feet from the bottom of the arena. The arena itself is approximately by . Roman artefacts including coins and pottery have been discovered on the site. It is estimated that it was constructed towards the beginning of the 2nd century. Here is a clearer view of the excavation area on the north-east quadrant. A thermal image captured in darkness. In Roman Britain, Cirencester was known as Corinium Dobunnorum, and was the second biggest town in Britannia, after Londinium (London). This amphitheatre is also the second largest, which indicates the significance of the location in Roman times. Although only slightly larger in diameter than the amphitheatre in Silchester, it has much higher sides. The earthworks show evidence of tiered wooden seats for around 8000 people, placed upon terraces made of stone, although a timber only structure may have existed before the 2nd century. There are two entrances, located at the North-Eastern and South- Western ends of the stadium. During the 5th century, when the Western Roman Empire was under attack and soldiers returned to Rome to defend it, the amphitheatre was fortified to defend against the invading Saxons. Wooden structures were erected within the arena itself, placed in postholes, and a portion of the North-Eastern entrance was blocked. Unlike other amphitheatres, it is aligned in parallel to the streets of the town itself. It has also been referred to as the 'Bull Ring', because the sport of bull-baiting used to take place there. In 2012 plans were announced by the Cirencester Town Council to improve access and signage at the site. Further plans for a visitor centre and car park followed in 2014.

Expedition to British East Africa 1897–99 In the late 19th century, the British took over control of area now forming Kenya and Uganda and declared it as the British East Africa Protectorate. However, despite harsh measures, they faced stiff resistance from the local princes and chiefs. In 1897, the situation took a serious turn in areas now forming Uganda, when the Sudanese troops of the local militia mutinied and killed their British officers. In December 1897, the 27th Regiment (1st Baluch Battalion) of Bombay (Light) Infantry (now 10th Battalion The Baloch Regiment of Pakistan Army) under Lieutenant Colonel WA Broome was despatched to East Africa to quell the rebellion. After a tough anti-insurgency operation lasting for a year, the situation was brought under control by January 1899, and the battalion returned to Karachi in May. During the campaign, the battalion suffered 56 casualties. For its services in the campaign, the Baluch battalion was awarded the Battle Honour of ‘British East Africa 1897–99’ in 1901. The Battle Honour is unique to this unit. In 1922, when the Regimental Group System was adopted by the British Indian Army, the battalion was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion (Queen Mary's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment, and the Battle Honour was extended to all the battalions of 10th Baluch Regiment.Maxwell, Lt Col WE.

Development  Wright-Whirlwind J-5 In 1925, Clarence Duncan Chamberlin was friends with, and worked as chief test pilot for, the aircraft designer Giuseppe Mario Bellanca. A flight instructor in World War I, Clarence was an early customer of Bellanca designs, purchasing the only Bellanca CE, built when he was working for the Maryland Pressed Steel Company. Through Clarence, Bellanca secured a position as a consultant for the Wright Aeronautical company to produce a 5–6 passenger aircraft to demonstrate their new Wright Whirlwind J-4 engine. Bellanca built an all-wood aircraft, the WB-1 in 1926, which crashed at Curtiss Field in an attempt on the world non-refueled endurance record. The WB-2 follow-on aircraft, made of fabric-covered steel tubing, was already in development to test the updated Wright Whirlwind J-5. The aircraft had some features intended for long-distance overseas flights built in. The landing gear could be dropped off, to prevent flipping in a water landing. Once on the water, the large gas tanks could provide flotation, and a saw was carried to drop the dead engine weight if needed. Operational history Lindbergh trumps Levine The WB-2 Columbia was introduced at the 1926 National Air Races flown by Lieut C.C. Champion, where it won both efficiency records. Wright Aeronautical chose to continue to develop the Whirlwind engine, but discontinue aircraft operations to avoid competition in profitable engine sales with rival aircraft manufacturers. Bellanca left Wright Aeronautical, with the rights to the WB-2, and the WB-2 prototype purchased for $15,500 and formed a new interest, Columbia Aircraft Company, with the investor Charles Levine. Levine became a millionaire at the young age of 28 by reselling surplus armaments to the United States government. When partnering with Bellanca, he had plans to put the WB-2 in production. The plans never came through, and the aircraft would not see production until Bellanca manufactured an updated version later in 1928 with his own company. *Endurance record Bellanca and Levine felt that Columbia could beat the current world record for endurance held by Maurice Drouhin and Landry Jules in France. Leigh Wade, a pilot of the 1924 round-the-world flight in a Douglas World Cruiser, was hired for publicity but soon quit in disagreements with Levine. Bert Acosta was brought on as his replacement. On April 12, 1927, Clarence Chamberlin and Bert Acosta set off on their endurance attempt. The aircraft was predicted to crash by Curtiss engineers, but took off in only 1200 feet of runway. They stayed aloft over Roosevelt field in New York City for 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds. The estimated distance flown was 4,100 miles, which was 500 more than was needed for the Ortieg Prize attempt between New York, USA and Paris, France. Shortly after the record flight, on April 24, 1927, the WB-2 was christened in Prohibition-era ginger ale the Columbia by Levine's 8-year-old daughter. Later that day, Chamberlin safely landed the plane with two children on board with a broken landing gear. *Missed opportunity with Lindbergh In late 1926, an enterprising Charles Lindbergh had convinced Earl Thompson, and Major Albert Bond Lambert to back him on an attempt to win the $25,000 Orteig Prize for a non-stop transatlantic flight. He specifically wanted a single pilot, and a single engine to reduce weight and chances of failure. The ideal plane was the Wright-Bellanca WB-2. Lindbergh set out by train to New York in a new suit to look professional for a face-to-face meeting with Columbia Aircraft to buy the only WB-2. In the meeting, Levine said the aircraft was worth $25,000, but would discount it to $15,000 due to the free publicity that would be made from the flight, well above the approximate $10,000 price that had been anticipated by Lindbergh and his backers. Lindbergh returned to St. Louis, and had a check signed to him personally for $15,000 and a request to name the WB-2 The Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh said he would have the plane back in St. Louis in a week. The second meeting in New York was attended by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the flight crew, to which Lindbergh objected. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, they made him leave to reconsider and call back the next day. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired what it would cost to buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000. *Orteig Prize attempt Prior to the crossing, Levine planned on using Clarence Chamberlin or Bert Acosta as pilot with Lloyd W. Bertaud as copilot. The pilots were promised a settlement to their wives if they crashed, and the prize money if they completed the flight, but Levine refused to sign the document before the flight. Bertaud first objected, then later offered to purchase Columbia for himself. Levine bumped Bertaud from the copilot position, prompting an injunction preventing any Ortieg record flight. Lindbergh arrived on May 5, 1927. While Chamberlin waited for the injunction to be lifted, his other competition, Admiral Byrd's team, was repairing his Fokker C-2 Trimotor, the America after a practice run crash. On May 20–21, 1927, Lindbergh left Roosevelt Field and crossed the Atlantic, while leaving the Columbia and Atlantic behind at the adjacent Curtiss Field. Bellanca publicly announced he was leaving the company. After the confirmation that Lindbergh had won the prize, Columbia was unloaded and a fire erupted from the spilled fuel. The tension between the various groups was still present, as each remaining plane could still make transatlantic records to other cities. While trying to position Columbia for another attempt at the crossing, mechanics from the American Trans-Oceanic Company (sponsor of the America, who also leased the airfield) would not allow Columbia to move without a permit from their president Grover Whalen, who could not be found. It was claimed later, that it was for everyone's safety to prevent stray aircraft on the field, Lindbergh had filled out his paperwork properly. *First transatlantic flight of Columbia The Brooklyn chamber of commerce also offered $15,000 for a transatlantic challenge. Chamberlin was given the piloting job, and picked Bernt Balchen as his co-pilot. Balchen was unavailable, so Chamberlin's wife was offered the seat for the attempt, only to be displaced by the flight's backer, Levine. On June 4, 1927 The Columbia took off on its transatlantic flight from America to Berlin, Germany, with Charles Levine as the first passenger to cross the Atlantic in an airplane, and making Columbia the third plane to fly non-stop across the Atlantic. In an oft-repeated situation, Levine told his wife he was just going up for a test flight. His lawyer notified her by a letter of his intentions after they took off and kept going. At one point in the flight, Levine was at the controls flying at 20,000 feet without oxygen. He entered a spin, and descended to 4,000 feet before recovering. The Columbia did not reach Berlin, but landed 100 miles short in a field at Eisleben, Germany. The flight covered 3,905 miles (6,285 km) and 42 hours and 45 minutes. The trip was 315 miles (507 km) and 9 hours and 6 minutes longer than Lindbergh's transatlantic crossing *The Queen of Diamonds While Levine in Europe, Mabel Boll \\"the Queen of Diamonds\\" attempted to get Levine to fly her to America in Columbia, which was still in France after a record setting flight from New York. The inexperienced owner of the aircraft, Levine had plans to fly it back to America with a French pilot, Maurice Drouhin. After disagreements with Droughin and Lawyers left the plane guarded and grounded. Levine took off to England claiming he was just testing the engine. Boll followed Levine to England by boat, talking Levine into letting her be a passenger. Just before the flight, Levine's new pilot Capt. Hinchliffe, publicly refused to let Boll fly along, and instead flew to Rome, Italy dropping a present to Benito Mussolini's son. Boll was invited to try an east–west flight from America, and she set out for New York by boat in January 1928. On December 30, 1927, Bellanca left Columbia aircraft, to form Bellanca Aircraft Company, taking with him again the rights to the WB-2 series of aircraft. *Non-stop flight to Cuba On March 5, 1928, Wilmer Stultz, O. Le Boutilier, and Mabel Boll on an improvised seat made the first non-stop flight in Columbia between New York, New York and Havana, Cuba. Mabell was soon turned down again to fly the Atlantic in Columbia by Levine. Undeterred, She publicly announced she had hired Stultz, and was going to make the attempt. Stultz abandoned the project, and Boll attempted to recruit Admiral Byrd's Fokker for the flight. She was passed over the opportunity by the much less flamboyant, and capable Amelia Earhart. Levine and Boll eventually partnered again, this time with competition. *Another missed opportunity - first female across the Atlantic attempt On June 26, 1928 Mabel Boll was filmed leaving Roosevelt Field in the newly renamed Miss Columbia. Mabel was later spotted in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland as a passenger in Columbia, piloted by Captain Oliver C. Le Boutillier and Arthur Argles. While Boll publicly announced aspiration to be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, Amelia Earhart was also in Newfoundland at the same time, and the German Thea Rasche. The newspapers was focused their attention on the aspirations of \\"the Diamond Queen of Broadway,\\" Preparations for the trip were done with full publicity. At the same time in relative secrecy, pilots, Wilmer Stultz and Gordon, were believed by the press to be preparing Byrd's Fokker Friendship for his planned trip to the South Pole. Stultz himself was planned to be the pilot of Columbia, and defected to Byrd's crew. On June 17 Friendship took off from the bay at Trepassey, Newfoundland with Earhart on board, while the crew of Columbia were grounded for 5 days due to the weather. Upon learning of successful flight by Earhart and crew, Bolls returned to America in Columbia, donating $500 to the Newfoundland airstrip for development. In 1929 Columbia placed second in a race from New York to California piloted by Commander John Iseman, Lieut. J Farnum. *Bermuda Record On June 29, 1930, Columbia performed the first non- stop flight from New York to Bermuda and back. The flight dropped off mail, but there was not a suitable landing field on the island at the time. The flight was piloted by Erroll Boyd, Roger Q. Williams, and Harry P. Conner took 17 hours, 3 minutes. Williams relocated Columbia to Montreal just two days before a hangar fire destroyed Columbia Airlines' newest plane, the underperforming Uncle Sam. A Sperry Horizon *Second transatlantic flight The Columbia was flown to Toronto, renamed Maple Leaf after the song \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\". The plane was then demonstrated at the 1930 Canadian National Exhibition. The aircraft had an early Sperry Attitude indicator installed, taken out of Jimmy Doolittle's Lockheed Vega. Pilot Roger Q. Williams, held up the flight for three weeks with legal disputes with Levine over back pay. On October 9, 1930, Maple Leaf performed the first transatlantic flight by a Canadian between Canada and London, England in 36 hours, 10 minutes. The aircraft was piloted by Erroll Boyd, and Harry P. Conner, who traveled with $18 in their pockets and an unpaid Toronto Hotel bill. Upon arrival they flew a tribute flight in honor of the R-101 crash victims. *New York to Haiti non- stop In 1933 Maple Leaf performed the first non-stop flight from New York to Haiti in 24 hours and 8 minutes. The pilots were Erroll Boyd, Robert G. Lyon, and a passenger, H.P. Davis. On June 7, 1933, Maple Leaf left Port-au-Prince, Haiti non-stop to Washington D.C. with a special-issue stamp. The aircraft was piloted by Erroll Boyd, and Robert G. Lyon. Maple Leaf was destroyed January 25, 1934 in a hangar fire at the Bellanca factory in Newcastle, Delaware. =Artifacts= *A Bellanca CH-400 painted to resemble the WB-2 Columbia is on display at the Virginia Aviation Museum. *The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum has in its collection an embossed aluminum ashtray made from the metal of the fuel tanks of Columbia after the fire. *A block of four stamps carried on the first transatlantic trip from Canada to England in Columbia was valued at $20,000 in 1995. *An original canvas panel from the transatlantic Columbia flight to Berlin with Clarence Chamberlin and Charles Levine is on display at Allen Airways in San Diego, California, along with Chamberlain's 1927 passport and several logbooks.

It has since been used for other expatriate nationalities. Cemetery tombstone sculpture Cemetery Details View of the British Cemetery  History  The British Cemetery began its activities in 1834, when the British Consul in Lima and Callao obtained a supreme decree from the Peruvian Government granting him the right to purchase a plot of land for the construction of a cemetery exclusively for burials of members of the British Colony.http://www.cementeriobritanico.pe/historia_eng.php For the proper management of this cemetery, in 1835 the Government of King George IV sent money through a British Parliament Act (Art. 6, Chapter 85, Paragraph 14), under the supervision of the British Consul in Peru. This marked the beginning of the British Cemetery Association, which has since then been protected by its Statutes. To corroborate the above, the Peruvian Government issued a supporting regulation under a Decree dated 5 May 1836, authorizing the burial of members of the British Colony. After more than 160 years, the British continue to be responsible for the Burial Ground Society (now the British Cemetery Association), with 2 British Cemeteries - the Old Cemetery in Bellavista - Callao and the New Cemetery in Av. Colonial, also in Callao, named that way for strictly chronological reasons. Present day Among the tombs at the Old British Cemetery in Bellavista, one can find the names of people of many other nationalities: Germans, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Hungarians, Czechoslovakians, Yugoslavians, Russians, Swiss, Chinese, Japanese, Americans and many others, as well as an endless variety of religions. People of these and other nationalities participated in the development of Peru after the war of independence from Spain in 1821. The very first person to be buried there was the youngest son of General Sir Gordon Drummond G.C.B., Lieutenant William Russell Drummond, who died when his leg was amputated on 1 January 1835 after being shot in an ambush while on duty. One of the men who fought for Peru's independence was the English General (subsequently named Peruvian Marshall) William Miller, who was originally buried in the British Cemetery in Bellavista upon his death on 31 October 1862, at 65 years of age. His remains were transferred to the \\" Official Pantheon of Heroes\\" on 16 October 1926, under the mandate of President Don Augusto B. Leguia, a great anglophile. However, not only illustrious people are buried in Bellavista. General Miller's favourite cook, a black man named William Hanam born in Kingston, Jamaica, died at the age of 60 from edema and was the 17th person to be buried in the Old British Cemetery. Several foreigners who died in the Battle of Angamos during the Pacific War between Chile and Peru were also buried there; others who survived the battle were later also laid to rest in the Bellavista Cemetery, including Samuel MacMahon, the first engineer of the Peruvian Monitor Huascar, who witnessed and survived the Battle of Angamos. During the same war, Bernard Fleming, a 17-year-old who was born in Lima of British parents, died in the Battle of Miraflores on 15 June 1881. His colleagues laid his body to rest in the British Cemetery. There are many other anecdotes like these. The cemetery contains five Commonwealth War Graves of British naval personnel, three from World War I and two from World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, details obtained from casualty record. Thanks to the documents kept in the Cemetery, we have a record of diseases and plagues of medical interest, such as the Yellow Fever plague in Lima in April 1868, when more than 200 Germans died within only a couple of months, without counting the British and Peruvian casualties of this disease. Another incident recorded was the Smallpox plague in 1879, a disease that has been very rare on these coasts since the discovery of the smallpox vaccine. Many members of the British and American colonies who helped develop the cemetery are also buried there, such as: William Pitt Adams, Business Manager and a prominent and well- known member of the British Delegation in Peru and one of the promoters of the Cemetery. Also buried there are the remains of the son of the former secretary of the American Treasury, the honourable A. Adams, Captain Alexander Dallas, Commander of the American Squadron in the Pacific. Europeans and their descendants include families like the Backus family, founders of the breweries, as well as descendants of the famous railway entrepreneur Mr. Enrique Meiggs who built the Southern Railway (Mollendo - Arequipa) during the Balta Government and, subsequently, the Central Railway. It is also the resting place of Scottish engineers who arrived to build the railway to La Oroya and died of the dreaded malaria.

Wells is a federal magistrate judge for the United States District Court for the District of Utah. She was appointed to this position on June 4, 2003.  Early life and education  Wells was raised in Oklahoma, and attended Oklahoma State for two years, but moved to Utah before completing her degree there.Rice, Robert O. “Judge Brooke Wells,” Litigation Section of the Utah State Bar—Benchbook. Wells had wanted to attend law school, but did not think that pathway open to herWelling, Angie. “Wells is sworn in as new federal magistrate,” Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City, Utah). 23 Aug. 2003. but changed her mind after she served as secretary to Randy Dryer while he was the Student Body President at the University of Utah.Hafen, Jonathan O. “Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells,” FBA Newsletter Profile. May 2004. Wells graduated from the University of Utah with an undergraduate degree in Political Science in 1973. She enrolled in the University of Utah's master's degree program in Public Administration and started taking classes, but no longer pursued the degree after she decided to attend law school instead. She received her juris doctor degree from the University of Utah's S. J. Quinney School of Law in 1977.  Legal career  Although she took and passed the Utah bar exam following graduation from law school, Wells moved to San Antonio, Texas. After she passed the Texas Bar Exam, she was hired as a legal services lawyer for Bexar County Legal Aid and provided civil legal assistance to indigent clients for two and a half years. However, she was eventually drawn to Utah again. She says she fully believes in the “theory that often times you have to leave someplace to find out how much you liked it and how much you want to return.” Beginning in 1979, and for almost fifteen years thereafter, Wells represented criminal defendants as an attorney in Salt Lake City for the Utah Legal Defender's Office. In 1994, U.S. Attorney Scott Matheson appointed her to Assistant U.S. Attorney, and she began her career as a legal prosecutor. Wells held the position of Chief of the Violent Crimes Section for eight and a half years until she was appointed as a federal magistrate judge in Utah in 2003. = High-profile clients as a legal defender = Wells litigated over 100 jury trials and more than 20 capital homicides during her time as a legal defender.Anderson, Shawn. “Just Do It,” Res Getae. Vol. 30. University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law. 2006. Two of her more high-profile clients were the following:  Ralph Menzies  In 1987, Ralph Leroy Menzies was convicted of the kidnap and murder of Maurine Hunsaker, a mother of four abducted from her work at a Kearns gas station.Funk, Marianne. “Inmate Makes 3rd Bid to Halt Execution,” The Deseret News. (Salt Lake City, Utah) 2 May 1995. Menzies was sentenced to the death penalty and is still on death row while numerous appeals are heard.  Steven Ray Stout  Stout pleaded guilty on September 27, 1989 to capital murder and second-degree murder. The victims were Bonnie Craft, his estranged wife's step mother (age 41) and her daughter Maureen Turner (age 18). Prosecutors argued that because Stout brutally killed the two West Valley citizens he should be given the death penalty. In response, Brooke Wells and Elizabeth Bowman, the two legal defenders assigned to the case had a psychologist testify that Stout suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome—a rare occurrence at the time. This was one of the first cases in which this defense was used, and it was deemed the “shell shock” defense.Israelsen, Brent. “Attorneys Say ‘Shell Shock’ Made Stout Kill,” The Deseret News. (Salt Lake City, Utah) 1 Nov. 1989. Stout, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, avoided the death penalty and was sentenced to life in prison. = Selected cases as an Assistant U.S. Attorney =  United States v. Eric W. Wicklund, 114 F. 3d 151 (10th Cir. 1997)  A Salt Lake City jury found Wicklund guilty of scheming to shoot his wife's ex-husband, Robert Laumann, an Idaho trooper from Downey so that his wife, Paige, would no longer have to pay child support to Laumann, who won custody in their divorce. Ms. Wells was the prosecutor who obtained the conviction. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the decision, holding that the trial judge misinterpreted and misapplied the statute under which Wicklund was charged.Cilwik, Ted. “Man on Trial for Plotting Trooper’s Murder Prosecutor Says he Wanted To Collect on Insurance,” The Salt Lake Tribune. (Salt Lake City, Utah) 5 Jan. 1996. Wicklund was sentenced to ten years in prison. The client, Gerry Curtis Branagan, had failed to attend his trial in Utah County and was thus convicted in absentia. It was alleged that his attorney hid and threw out stolen goods from Branagan's residence in California. The jury found his guilty of “concealing a fugitive from arrest and concealing and disposing of stolen goods.” Branagan was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison and a $10,000 fine.Welling, Angie. The Deseret News. (Salt Lake City, Utah) 7 November 2002. F. and E. were later acquitted of their convictions  Judicial career  From 2008 until the present, Wells has presided over two specialized federal court programs. The first program, called RISE (Reentry Independence through Sustainable Efforts), was the only program in the United States, when it started, to have a specialized mental health court docket for people coming out of federal prison with severe mental illness. The mental health defendants have an obligation to attend counseling, take prescribed medications, and report to the court on a weekly basis as a part of their plea in abeyance that keeps them out of prison. Wells said, “It’s a positive approach rather than a punitive approach…we’re a problem-solving group.”Manson, Pamela. “Federal court program helps mentally ill convicts,” The Salt Lake Tribune. (Salt Lake City, Utah) 13 April 2009.For more information about this specialized mental health court, see this article The second program is a specialized drug court docket for re-entry for people with severe drug abuse problems. She also chairs a state federal advisory board to attempt to identify and eliminate barriers to employment, where re-entering offenders can meet their obligations instead of returning to prison. = Selected civil cases =  SCO v. IBM  On March 3, 2003, SCO Group filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against IBM for allegedly devaluing its version of the Linux operating system and breaching its obligations under various UNIX licensing agreements. Federal Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells was in charge of presiding over all discovery aspects of the case. She made several key rulings in the case regarding the scope of discovery, sanctions, and the scope of permissible claims allowed to be tried. The presiding trial judge upheld her rulings. The litigation has had many turns and twists, including detours to appeals and bankruptcy courts. The matter is still in litigation.For a listing of orders and decisions by Magistrate Wells, see the opinions listed by the judge on the U.S. District Court, District of Utah, website = Professional recognition = Wells became the first Utah woman inducted into the American Board of Criminal Lawyers in 1992. Also in 1992, Governor Mike Leavitt’s Commission for Women and Families named her one of their ten “Remarkable Utah Women.” In 1993, she became the first Utah woman to become a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers. Also, after nine years as federal prosecutor, she was officially recognized by the Department of Justice for Outstanding Achievement as an Assistant United States Attorney. Judge Wells gave the commencement address to the 2006 graduating class at the S.J. Quinney College of Law, her alma mater.  Personal life  Outside of her time on the bench, Judge Wells enjoys riding horses. She owns several horses that she houses in Salt Lake County for the warmer times of the year and Sanpete County for the more drastic temperatures and weather of winter months. During her spare time, she can be found riding trails, taking care of barn duties, or playing with her Springer Spaniels.

Vaccinium deliciosum is native to western North America from British Columbia to northern California with a few isolated populations in eastern Idaho. It grows at elevations of in subalpine and alpine climates. Its habitat includes coniferous forests, meadows, and clearings.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapTurner Photographics, Vaccinium deliciosum - Wildflowers of the Pacific Northwest photos, description, partial distribution mapCalflora taxon report, University of California, Vaccinium deliciosum Piper, Cascade bilberry Description Vaccinium deliciosum is a rhizomatous shrub taking a clumpy, matted form, its tangling stem rooting where its nodes touch moist substrate. It may form expansive colonies. The new green twigs are hairless and waxy and the deciduous leaves are alternately arranged. The thin oval leaf blades are between 1.5 and 5 cm in length while the edges are mostly smooth but may be serrated near the ends. Solitary flowers occur in the leaf axils. Each is 6 or 7 millimeters long, widely urn-shaped to rounded, and pale pink in color. The fruit is a waxy blue or reddish berry with a powdery coating which may be over a centimeter (>0.4 inches) wide. It is said to be particularly tasty.Flora of North America, Vaccinium deliciosum Piper, 1901. Cascade bilberry This species can sometimes be confused with Vaccinium caespitosum which grows in wetter areas in the same region. V. deliciosum has a powdery coating on the underside of its leaves, while V. caespitosum does not. =Physiology= Studies show that the intense flavor of the fruits of this plant come from at least 31 different aromatic flavor compounds V. deliciosum, like other plants that live alpine communities, have adapted to survive in growing seasons as short as three or four months. From late fall to spring, the plants rely on snow cover to insulate them from temperatures more than several degrees below freezing. Blossoms can become damaged and summer growth can be stunted if the plants experience a hard frost below negative four degrees celsius if unprotected by snow. However, the plants do require a vernalization period of freezing temperatures for at least a few months for flowering to occur. Vaccinium deliciosum fruit =Ecology= The berries are an important food source subalpine zones, and especially in alpine communities which do not have very many edible plants. Animals that feed on the berries include black bear, birds, mice, and chipmunks, while rabbits and deer eat the foliage. The berries are a favorite among humans, due to their intensely sweet flavor, and can be eaten fresh, dried, or cooked in various dishes. The berries were a staple in the diet of Native Americans in the Columbia Plateau region, who would often travel long distances to harvest the berries. Some tribes performed prescribed burns to create more favorable habitats for the plant. After naturally occurring and prescribed forest fires in alpine communities, V. deliciousum is oftentimes one of the most successful surviving plant species. Since the shrub is rhizomatous, it is sometimes possible to transplant and cultivate cuttings for agricultural or landscaping purposes. However, V. deliciosum oftentimes has difficulty growing at elevations below 2000 ft.

It occurred on 11 March 1641 near the Mbororé mountain, now the town of Panambí in the Misiones Province, Argentina. Historic Antecedents =Need for Slaves and the beginning of the 'bandeiras'= In the early 17th century, the Dutch landed on the Brazil coasts intending to settle there. They did this by using piracy to control navigation along the Atlantic coast, disrupting the Brazilian slave trade. This was a heavy blow to the Portuguese Empire, which needed slave labor to cultivate sugar and raise livestock, the industries which prevailed on the Atlantic coast of Brazil. As a result of this disruption, the Portuguese plantation owners began to make inroads into the local Indian population to make up the shortfall in slave labor. Moreover, due to the small quantities of silver, gold and precious stones found in the region of Piratininga, the scouts began to move towards the unknown interior of Brazil. These exploration and slave hunting groups, called bandeiras, were organized and managed as a business for the leading sectors of São Paulo, and their ranks included Mamluks (Portuguese/Indian Mestizos), indigenous Tupi and Dutch who came to Brazil to try their luck. They had the support of Spanish and Paraguayan officials. In their advance toward the west, the frontiersmen never crossed the threshold specified by the Treaty of Tordesillas. Indirectly, the Bandeirantes of São Paulo became the vanguard of the Portuguese territorial expansion, which was consolidated by recovering Portugal's independence from Spain. =First Attacks on the Jesuit Missions= By decree in 1608, the governor of Asuncion, Paraguay, Hernando Arias de Saavedra ordered the Jesuits to areas surrounding the Parana River, Guayrá and areas inhabited by guaycurúes to found towns and evangelize the natives who inhabited these regions. Later, he included the peoples of Itatin (north of Asuncion) and Tape (the current state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). The Jesuits had begun this evangelization when the frontiersmen began arriving in eastern Guayrá. At first, they respected the indigenous peoples so treated by the Jesuits. However, the Guarani, concentrated in towns and skilled in various trades, represented a highly skilled workforce, defenseless because they could not bear arms as a result of another of the governor's decrees. Beginning in 1620, bandeiras' raids became increasingly aggressive, forcing the abandonment or relocation of some villages. Between 1628 and 1631 the bandeirantes' leaders, Raposo Tavares and Manuel Antonio Pires Preto and their men periodically struck Guayrá, capturing thousands of Guarani who were then auctioned off at São Paulo. It is estimated that in the years 1628-1629, raids captured some 5,000 Indians, of which only 1,200 reached São Paulo. The vast majority of them died in transit as a result of the slave traders' treatment. By the year 1632, 12,000 Guarani had been forcibly moved south, leaving the Guayrá region virtually deserted, in addition to population reductions in the nearby regions of San Ignacio Mini and Loreto in the territory of the present Province of Misiones. The Bandeirantes continued westward, striking Itatin in 1632. Then followed the Tape, invaded during the years 1636, 1637 and 1638 by successive bandeiras Raposo Tavares led by André Fernandes and Fernando Dias Pais. The Jesuits' Defence =Montoya's Mission to the Crown= In 1638, priests Antonio Ruiz de Montoya and Francisco Diaz Tano traveled to Spain in order to report to the King Felipe IV recent events in the missions. They wanted the King to lift his restrictions on the use of firearms by the natives. The recommendations of Ruiz de Montoya were accepted by the King and Council of the Indies, and dispatched several royal charters to Paraguay. By Royal Decree of 12 May 1640, the Guaraní were allowed to take firearms for their defense, but if so directed by the prior Viceroy of Peru. The priests returned to Lima, with the intent of providing weapons to the natives, while Father Tano went to Rome to inform the Pope of the slave-hunting missions in order to obtain a papal protection.  The Apostles of Caazapaguazú skirmish  Meanwhile, prior to the imminent danger of the frontiersmen crossing the Uruguay River, the regional priest Diego de Boroa, with the consent of the Governor of Asuncion and Real Audiencia of Charcas, decided that the mission troops should receive firearms and begin military training. From Buenos Aires was sent eleven Spanish to organize the defense forces. In late 1638, Father Diego de Alfaro crossed the Uruguay River with a number of Guaraní, armed and trained, with the intention of recovering indigenous territory and eventually face the bandeirantes who roamed the region. After some sporadic encounters with the forces of São Paulo, the troops were joined by Father Alfaro and 1,500 Guarani led by Father Romero. He then formed an army of 4,000 missionaries who advanced to the ravaged reduction Apostles Caazapaguazú where bandeirantes were entrenched after several partial defeats. The armed clash was the first decisive victory of the Guarani over the Paulistas, who abruptly fled after surrendering.[ambiguous] =São Paulo's government prepares the counterattack = Torn apart, the Bandeirantes forces returned to São Paulo to tell authorities what happened. Coincidentally, at that same time, Father Tano came to Rio de Janeiro from Madrid and Rome. He had in his possession royal charters and Papal Bulls condemning the bandeiras' conducting human trafficking with the indigenous people. Both events produced a backlash in the government of São Paulo which, in agreement with the plantations, expelled the Jesuits from the city. The city organized a huge bandeira with 450 Dutch and Portuguese armed with rifles and muskets, 700 canoes and 2,700 Tupi archers, led by Manuel Pires. The aim of the expedition was to take and destroy everything that was along the Uruguay and Paraná Rivers, taking all potential slaves.

Early life Edward was the eldest son of Edward Wakefield (1750–1826) and Priscilla Bell and was born in 1774. He was the brother of Daniel Wakefield (1776–1846) and Isabella Wakefield (3 Mar 1773–17 October 1841)who married Joshua Head of Ipswich on 12 Sep 1794. Career Wakefield commenced adult life as a farmer near Romford in Essex, and was subsequently employed under the naval arsenal. In 1814 he established himself as a land agent at 42 Pall Mall. He soon became well known as an authority on agriculture, while his interest in education won for him the character of a practical philanthropist. He was a strong advocate of the educational theories of Joseph Lancaster, and was on terms of intimacy with James Mill and Francis Place. Author Wakefield is best known as the author of Ireland, Statistical and Political, published in 1812, a work which, in spite of many inaccuracies, is, from the candour and tolerance it displays, a very valuable account of Ireland in the early years of the nineteenth century. The book was undertaken in 1808 at the suggestion of John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel, formerly chancellor of the Irish exchequer, and Wakefield devoted four years to the task. Mackintosh in the Edinburgh Review, while noting its defects in matters of detail, said of this work that \\"few books have stronger marks of the candour and probity of the writer;\\" and McCulloch called it \\"the best and most complete work on Ireland since Arthur Young's tour\\". Wakefield was a warm admirer of Pitt, by whom he is said to have been consulted in regard to Ireland, and was also confidentially employed by Lord Melville (see Robert Saunders Dundas).

Plot Van Alden continues to question Sebso's lies about Winslow's death, prompting Sebso to call Nucky asking for leads to regain his trust. Nucky tells him about an illegal still in the woods on the outskirts of Atlantic City, and suggests Sebso tell Van Alden about it. As they look for the still, the two agents come upon a black church's river baptism, prompting Van Alden to shed tears. Sebso, who is Jewish, puts in for a transfer to Detroit and confronts a still-suspicious Van Alden about his hostility and anti-Semitism. Exasperated in spite of his actual guilt, Sebso demands to know how he might earn his trust before leaving. In response, Van Alden brings him to the river and bullies the smaller man into being baptized.

The Commodore tries to mollify Jimmy, even telling him that \\"the wrong man is running this town,\\" implying that Jimmy should supplant Nucky, whom Gillian reveals was the one who brought her to the Commodore decades previously. Jimmy decides to stay with his father as he passes away. The decision proves crucial, as Jimmy is first to find out when the doctor detects significant amounts of arsenic (Paris Green) in the Commodore's hair sample. The Commodore begins to recover, and Jimmy confronts Gillian with an empty canister of arsenic that he found in the trash.

Courtship and proposals Prince Albert, Duke of York, \\"Bertie\\" to the family, was the second son of King George V. He was second in line to succeed his father, behind his elder brother Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales. He initially proposed to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1921, but she turned him down, being \\"afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to\\". When he declared he would marry no one else, his mother, Queen Mary, visited Glamis to see for herself the girl her son wanted to marry. She became convinced that Elizabeth was \\"the one girl who could make Bertie happy\\", but nevertheless refused to interfere. At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert's equerry, until he left the prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.Shawcross, pp. 133–135 In February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, Princess Mary, to Viscount Lascelles.Shawcross, pp. 135–136 The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.Shawcross, p. 136 Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life. Wedding Combined coat of arms of Albert and Elizabeth, the Duke and Duchess of York Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. The couple's wedding rings were crafted from 22 carat Welsh gold from the Clogau St David's mine in Bontddu. In the following years, the use of Clogau Gold within the wedding rings of the royal family became a tradition. In an unexpected and unprecedented gesture,Shawcross, p. 177 Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of The Unknown Warrior on her way into the Abbey, in memory of her brother Fergus. Ever since, the bouquets of subsequent royal brides have traditionally been laid at the tomb, though after the wedding ceremony rather than before. Lady Elizabeth was attended by eight bridesmaids: *The Lady Mary Cambridge (26), daughter of the Marquess and Marchioness of Cambridge, niece of Queen Mary and thus a cousin of the groom *The Lady May Cambridge (17), daughter of Princess Alice and the Earl of Athlone, niece of Queen Mary and thus first cousin of the groom *The Lady Mary Thynn (20), daughter of the Marquess and Marchioness of Bath *The Lady Katharine Hamilton (23), daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Abercorn *The Hon Diamond Hardinge (22), daughter of Lord and Lady Hardinge *The Hon Cecilia Bowes-Lyon (11), daughter of Lord and Lady Glamis, niece of the bride *The Hon Mary Elizabeth Elphinstone (11), daughter of Lord and Lady Elphinstone, niece of the bride *Miss Betty Cator (later sister-in-law to the bride, as Hon Mrs Michael Bowes-Lyon) The newly formed British Broadcasting Company had wanted to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, Herbert Edward Ryle, was in favour). Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, not a member of a royal family, though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses.Roberts, pp. 57–58; Shawcross, p. 113 The event was not broadcast on the radio due to the Archbishop of Canterbury's concern \\"that men might listen to it in public houses\\". Wedding attire =Bride's dress= Elizabeth's wedding dress was made from deep ivory chiffon moire, embroidered with pearls and a silver thread. It was intended to match the traditional Flanders lace provided for the train by Queen Mary. Elizabeth's dress, which was in the fashion of the early 1920s, was designed by Madame Handley-Seymour, dressmaker to Queen Mary. Its design was reportedly based on a dress created by Jeanne Lanvin and was \\"suggestive of a medieval Italian gown\\". Elizabeth chose not to wear a tiara, and instead a chaplet of leaves secured the veil. A strip of Brussels lace, inserted in the dress, was a Strathmore family heirloom. A female ancestor of the bride wore it to a grand ball for \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\", Charles Edward Stuart. The silver leaf girdle had a trail of spring green tulle, trailing to the ground; silver and rose thistle fastened it. According to an era news article: \\"In the trimming the bride has defied all old superstitions about the unluckiness of green.\\" Elizabeth wore \\"an orange blossom wreath\\", which featured \\"white roses of York\\". The dress had two trains: \\"one fastened at the hips, the other floating from the shoulders\\". Unlike more recent dresses, details of this one were publicly revealed in advance of the wedding day. However, the dress was worked on until the last possible opportunity: the day before the wedding, Elizabeth divided her time between the wedding rehearsal and her dressmakers. A prototype of the wedding dress was sold at an auction in 2011 for £3,500. It was one of the three initial designs prepared for the wedding and the one used for the final design. =Groom's uniform= Prince Albert wore RAF full dress in the rank of group captain, his senior service rank at the time of his marriage. Honeymoon Upon their marriage, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York.Shawcross, p. 168 Following a wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace prepared by chef Gabriel Tschumi, they honeymooned at Polesden Lacey, a manor house in Surrey, and then went to Scotland, where she caught \\"unromantic\\" whooping cough.Letter from Albert to Queen Mary, 25 May 1923, quoted in Shawcross, p. 185 Notes References * * Albert, Duke of York, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Category:1923 in London Albert, Duke of York, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Category:George VI Category:Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Category:April 1923 events Albert, Duke of York, and Elizabeth Bowes- Lyon Category:1920s in the City of Westminster ","title":"Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon"},{"id":"29638837","text":"William Pitt Amherst, 2nd Earl Amherst (3 September 1805 – 26 March 1886), styled Viscount Holmesdale between 1826 and 1857, was a British peer.

Nucky and Atlantic City brace for change on Election Day; Torrio brokers a deal between two nemeses, with far-reaching consequences; Jimmy ponders his future, as do Margaret, Agent Van Alden and Eli.A Return to Normalcy - IGN The title of the episode is a reference to the acceptance speech of President Warren G. Harding, which is featured on the show. Plot Van Alden, having passed off Sebso's death as a heart attack, requests a transfer out of Atlantic City, although his supervisor asks him to reconsider. When Van Alden tells his wife Rose of his decision, she tries to dissuade him; he says if God should want him to remain in Atlantic City, he will send him a sign. Meanwhile, the Commodore's maid admits she tried to poison him because of his constant mistreatment. Nucky lets her leave Atlantic City quietly over the protests of the Commodore. Nucky is increasingly stressed about the election, which the Democrats stand a good chance of winning. Chalky offers to deliver the black vote for $10,000, a new car, and an invitation to Nucky's (whites only) election party. Margaret and her children are staying with Nan, who insists that Warren G. Harding will send for her when he becomes President. Margaret does not have the heart to tell her otherwise, but is preoccupied with taking care of the children and deciding whether to leave Atlantic City. Rothstein is about to flee the country to escape an indictment in the Black Sox Scandal when Luciano and Lansky suggest negotiating with Nucky to end their gang war. At a meeting brokered by Torrio, Nucky agrees to end the war and use his political connections to quash the indictment for $1 million in cash and the location of the remaining D'Alessio brothers. As Nucky calls a press conference blaming the D'Alessios for the truck heist, Jimmy, Capone, and Richard murder the gang. Through Nan and an All Hallow's Eve procession through a cemetery, Margaret discovers the graves of Nucky's wife and child. When Margaret returns to ask him about them, he tells her how happy and terrified he was by his son's birth - so terrified of harming the baby that he buried himself in work. After a week he finally approached the cradle, only to find his son already dead from pneumonia and his wife's mind permanently shattered with grief. Nucky then says that he experienced the same terror and happiness in spending time with Margaret and her children. Margaret decides that Nucky must be kind at heart, but asks him why he does what he does. He responds that everyone must decide how much sin they can live with, and the two say farewell, with Margaret planning to leave Atlantic City after the election. Confronted by Angela about his disturbing night terrors, Jimmy talks to her about his life in the trenches, and the two agree to forgive each other and start afresh. However, when Angela receives an apologetic postcard from Mary in Paris, she cuts her long hair that Jimmy was so fond of, disappointing him. Lucy informs Van Alden that their one-night stand has made her pregnant. On election night, Bader wins and the Republicans score a decisive victory across the city. Eli is still angry with Nucky for dropping him from the ticket, but Nucky promises to make it up to him. Nucky has Bader fire Halloran and reinstate Eli as sheriff as his first official act; this only humiliates Halloran and fails to mollify Eli. Further spoiling the celebration, a drunken Jimmy confronts Nucky, accusing him of pimping out his mother to the Commodore and generally exploiting everyone around him. Margaret and Nucky reunite before the presidential election is called for Harding. At his mansion, the Commodore tells Jimmy how Nucky's recent actions with his maid represents a final insult. Years previously, Nucky was sheriff in the Commodore's political machine; when Governor Woodrow Wilson sought to indict them, the Commodore took the fall and left Nucky to manage things, only to have Nucky completely usurp his position by the time he left prison. The Commodore reinforces Jimmy's opinion of Nucky as a smooth manipulator lacking the stomach to do his own dirty work. Finally, Eli walks into the room, and the Commodore asks Jimmy to join them in dethroning Nucky. The end montage shows the characters contemplating their decisions and futures. Margaret and Nucky leave the celebration and stand out on the Boardwalk, gazing out towards the ocean as the sun rises. Reception =Critical response= IGN gave the episode a score of 8.5. The website said, \\"As Harding's victory speech calls for a return to normalcy, despite Margaret back in his life, Nucky is poised to return to anything but. 'Everyone of us must decide how much sin we can live with.' The amount Nucky has chosen for himself threatens to bite him in the ass, despite the episode's 'happy' ending. For Boardwalk to raise the bar it's already placed quite high, this consequence thing will have to get more play in a second season. For the only thing that can be better than Nucky getting away 'fast, [and] totally devoid of any emotion' is watching him squirm when there are no clean getaways.\\" =Ratings= The season finale rose two tenths of a point a 1.3 adults 18–49 rating, and added about 300,000 viewers vs. last week. \\"A Return to Normalcy\\" had a viewership of 3.294 million.http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/07/sunday-cable-ratings-the- walking-dead-boardwalk-empire-finales-rise-sarah-palins-alaska-dexter-the- hasslehoffs-more/74601 References  External links  * \\"A Return to Normalcy\\" at HBO * * Category:Boardwalk Empire episodes Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"A Return to Normalcy"},{"id":"29638890","text":"Terry Jones is the founder and former CEO of Travelocity, chairman of Kayak.com, CIO of Sabre Inc., and motivational speaker.

He is best known for his discovery and subsequent excavations at the Lower Palaeolithic site of Boxgrove Quarry in southern England. He is also a teacher and Senior Research Fellow of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London. In 1994, he was awarded the Stopes Medal for his contribution to the study of Palaeolithic humans and Pleistocene geology.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. opening sleeve.\\"Boxgrove Staff\\". Boxgrove Project site. Available at Born in Chichester, West Sussex, Roberts developed an interest in geology and archaeology at an early age, working at a series of local excavations before going off to study at the then-independent Institute of Archaeology in Bloomsbury, London in 1980. Soon after, he initiated excavations at Boxgrove, West Sussex, uncovering the best preserved Middle Palaeolithic site then known to archaeologists. Eventually, in 1993 the project unearthed remains belonging to a Homo heidelbergensis, which proved to be the earliest known hominin in Europe at that time. Boxgrove excavations continued until 1996, following which Roberts published the findings from the site, including the book Fairweather Eden (1998), co-written with Mike Pitts. Since then, Roberts has focused his excavations at other sites, such as the Bronze and Iron Age landscape of Bow Hill, West Sussex, where he was involved in excavating Goosehill Camp, and also the Late Mediaeval house at Blackden, Cheshire, which is the home to the novelist Alan Garner, and where he co-directed excavations with fellow archaeologist Richard Morris. Early life: 1961–1982 Roberts was born in Chichester, West Sussex in 1961, and lived with his parents and three younger siblings (two brothers and a sister) in the town of East Preston. Initially attending the local County Primary School, his family later relocated to Worthing, from where he began attending Elm Grove School. Passing his 11-plus exam, he began studying at Worthing High School. He disliked school, although did both O levels and then A levels, whilst meanwhile maintaining an interest in fossils, which he collected from the local chalk pits.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 71. In 1978, Roberts volunteered to work on an archaeological excavation – run by the Sussex Archaeological Field Unit – of a Bronze Age site known as Black Patch in the West Sussex chalk downs overlooking Newhaven,Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 72. a site that he would later tell an interviewer has remained one of his favourites for the rest of his life.Kontonicolas, Ali and Roberts 2011. p. 12. One of hundreds of handaxes found at Boxgrove Quarry; it was the discovery of such items that first interested Roberts in the Palaeolithic. Developing an interest in the archaeological discipline, in 1980 Roberts began studying for a BA degree in the subject at the then-independent Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in Bloomsbury, London. He had been influenced in his choice of university by the fact that Peter Drewett, whom he had worked with through the Sussex Field Unit, occasionally lectured there, and because it was opposite a rugby club where he could indulge in his love for the sport.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 72–73. At the IOA, he played rugby for University College London (UCL) 1st XV during the first year, and rose to become captain of the team in the second, although during his third year of university studies left this club and signed on to play for Finchley RFC instead.Kontonicolas, Ali and Roberts 2011. p. 13. According to his own account, it was during his time studying at the Institute he was \\"thrown out of the UCL union bar for a one man rendition of a lewd and sexist song\\" and was also \\"reprimanded for carving and planting a Chalk phallus in the trench of a particularly difficult excavator\\". On breaks from his university studies, Roberts returned home to West Sussex, where he continued excavating with the Sussex Archaeological Field Unit at a project unearthing a prehistoric enclosure and field banks on Halnaker Hill, which overlooked the little village of Halnaker.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 73. Adjacent to Halnaker was a quarry, then being dug out by the Amey Roadstone Corporation (ARC), whose foreman, Godfrey Udeil, subsequently informed the archaeologists that his men had found a ditch and pot sherds dating from the Romano-British period in their gravel pits. The Institute of Archaeology decided to open up excavations of this ditch in 1982 and 1983, with Roberts being employed as supervisor for the first of these two seasons by site director Owen Bedwin. The excavations actually led to the discovery of a Romano-British farmstead, although the site also revealed evidence of older occupation; many of the excavators spent their free time hunting for the Palaeolithic stone tools – or \\"palaeos\\" – which were found scattered about the Quarry.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 73–75. Although he had never dug a Palaeolithic site before, these random finds began to interest Roberts, and when he showed them to the Department of the Environment's chief archaeologist Geoffrey Wainwright on the latter's tour of the excavation, it spiked his interest too. Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 75–76. Boxgrove Quarry: 1982–1996 Boxgrove Quarry was an area that had been quarried for several decades throughout the 20th century. The nearest village to the site was Halnaker, although Boxgrove was the nearest large village, and the site came within the boundaries of the Boxgrove civil parish, and it is for this reason that the archaeological site became known as \\"Boxgrove\\".Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 7. =Initial survey: 1982= Having worked in the Boxgrove Quarry unearthing the Romano-British farmstead, Mark Roberts had become particularly interested by the Palaeolithic archaeology of the site, and decided that he would use this as the basis for his dissertation that was required to complete his BA in archaeology at the Institute.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 74. At the time \\"struggling to find money for beer and pencils\\", in 1982 he undertook a small survey of the quarry.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 19. In his dissertation, Roberts drew on the wealth of recently published material about the geology and Palaeolithic archaeology of Sussex. Archaeologists had first began exploring various quarries in the Sussex area for Palaeolithic remains in the 1970s, taking advantage of the exposed geological layers that had been cut away in the preceding decades. In 1977 archaeologist John Wymer and geologist Roy Shephard-Thorn visited the area to gain a better understanding of its local geology, whilst the curator of Chichester District Museum, Andrew Woodcock, had begun a project to investigate Palaeolithic Sussex. Woodcock had noted the discovery of various Palaeolithic stone tools at the Slindon Quarry (which was near to the Boxgrove Quarry), and opened a small excavation at the site, unearthing a collection of lithics and several mammal bones that were in an undisturbed layer. Woodcock called on the aid of Shephard-Thom and other geologists to aid him in his study, eventually coming to the conclusion that the current understanding of Sussex geology was far too oversimplified.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 67–70. =Initial excavation: 1983–1992= Tray of Happisburgh flints (not on display) at the British Museum. In 1983, Roberts decided to begin actual excavation at Boxgrove. =Discovering hominin remains: 1993–1994= In 1993 Roberts decided that to answer a few questions about the site's geology that still intrigued him, he must open up a small- scale unofficial excavation, digging a few test pits with the help of Danish archaeologist Roger Pedersen (1929–). Facing particularly rainy conditions in the middle of winter, in Trench 5 Pedersen uncovered a large yet fragile bone which he subsequently removed within a block of protective silt. At the time, Roberts was away at a conference on Palaeolithic archaeology in Tautavel, France, and so Pedersen contacted Simon Parfitt at his home in London to inform him of his discovery.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 25, 32–34. Suspecting that the bone had most likely belonged to a prehistoric deer, Parfitt did not immediately rush to Boxgrove, only inspecting it upon his next visit to the site; as Roberts and Mike Pitts later related in their account of its discovery: :It was so fragmentary, so many flakes and splinters, probably crushed by the pressure of the sediments it lay in, that it was totally unrecognisable. All [Simon Parfitt] could say was that it was a large bone. So with little dabs of UHU, he gently rebuilt Roger's find, until there were essentially just two parts, the two-halves of a long bone, a long longbone, broken across the middle. Then Simon drew the two lengths gently together. Bang. That's it: it's human.Pitts and Roberts 1998. p. 42. Parfitt finally revealed to Roberts that he was \\"90 per cent certain\\" that the bone had come from a hominin in the middle of their annual Christmas dinner at the local Anglesey Arms pub.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 1–2, 42–43. English Heritage eventually decided to issue a news release of the hominid bone's discovery on 16 May 1994, but stressed to the assembled journalists that they must not publish this discovery until 26 May, because the academic journal Nature had obtained first rights to the story. Nonetheless, the journalists from The Times disregarded this, publishing a story on the bone in their 17 May edition that proclaimed \\"English Heritage finds the Oldest Human in Europe – and he is English\\".Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 56–57. =Renewed investigations: 1994–1996= In 2011, Roberts told interviewers from the student-produced archaeological magazine Artifact that Boxgrove was \\"a fickle mistress indeed\\" and that whilst he wouldn't change his experience in investigating the site, the excavations \\"extracted a very heavy price\\" from him, \\"a price that I am only just at the point of paying the final instalment on\\". For this reason he found that he often hummed The Specials' 1979 song \\"Too Much Too Young\\" to himself when thinking about the project.Kontonicolas, Ali and Roberts 2011. pp. 12–13. =Publication= In 1998, Roberts co-wrote a book about the site with prehistoric archaeologist Michael Pitts that was entitled Fairweather Eden: Life in Britain half a million years ago as revealed by the excavations at Boxgrove. Published by Arrow Books, Fairweather Eden was designed for a popular audience. One reviewer of the book, A.M. Chadwick, noted that within it: :Mark Roberts, is given centre stage, but this is at the expense of other participants in the project. Almost prescient powers of perception and forward-thinking are attributed to Mark Roberts, and some of the book's more purple passages describe these… What we are presented is a picture of a lone archaeological warrior battling against the archaeological establishment. Whilst this may have been true of the project's early years, modern multidisciplinary research projects simply do not work like that.Chadwick, A.M. 1998. Review of Fairweather Eden. Available at http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/assemblage/html/4/4pit_rob.html Fairweather Eden was followed by the publication of the full archaeological report on the excavations at Boxgrove, co-written with Simon Parfitt. Boxgrove: A Middle Pleistocene Hominid Site at Eartham Quarry, Boxgrove, West Sussex (1999) was published by English Heritage.

Bow Hill and Blackden excavations: 1997–2012 Blackden in Cheshire was the home of novelist Alan Garner and his wife Griselda. Personal life Roberts is an atheist, and has a longstanding partner named Julie. When asked by interviewers how he would describe himself in three words, he commented that he believed himself to be \\"fair, caring, competitive\\", and went on to describe his motto in life as being \\"Try as hard as you can to be honest with yourself.\\" Roberts' hobbies include fly fishing, shooting, rugby, cricket, cooking and reading novels. The Palaeolithic archaeologist A.M. Chadwick mentioned that \\"Roberts is a noted shooting and fishing man, and whilst I was at Boxgrove in 1988, wild game constituted a substantial part of the menu (even including a seagull on one memorable and not too successful occasion!).\\" Bibliography =Books and reports= *Michael Pitts and Mark Roberts. 1998.

Synopsis Darcy Anderson has been married to Bob, an accountant from Portland, Maine, for 27 years. They have a happy yet humdrum relationship, running a mail-order business selling and appraising rare coins. One day, while Bob is away on business, Darcy goes into the garage to search for batteries. When she rummages through Bob's belongings, she stumbles across a pornographic magazine showing sadomasochistic images. Unnerved by the magazine - and that it is in Bob's possession - Darcy finds a secret compartment behind the garage's baseboard and makes a more horrific discovery: a small box containing the ID cards of Marjorie Duvall, a victim of a serial killer called \\"Beadie\\". Bob phones Darcy and senses her distress. Afterwards, Darcy Googles Beadie and cross-checks Bob's business records with the locations of the murders, finding that Bob was close to most of the crimes. When Darcy wakes up the next morning, she finds that Bob has deduced her discovery and returned home early. He calmly explains his insanity to his horrified wife, recounting how he and a sadistic friend named Brian Delahanty - nicknamed \\"BD\\", from which Beadie's name was derived - planned a school shooting as teenagers. Delahanty was hit by a truck before they could carry it out, but Bob claims he had \\"infected\\" him with \\"certain ideas,\\" resulting in his homicidal urges. Bob claims that after he started his family with Darcy, his murderous alter ego receded and he was not driven to kill again for several years. He pleads to Darcy to put the matter behind them, for the sake of herself and their family. After mulling it over, Darcy feigns an agreement to do so, on the condition that he bury Duvall's ID cards deep in the woods. Bob believes Darcy has put the truth behind her; however, she is trying to think of a way to stop him from killing again. A few months after Darcy's discoveries, an elated Bob finds a rare 1955 doubled die cent, and the couple goes out to Portland to celebrate. When Bob becomes drunk from champagne, Darcy devises a plan to murder him. Upon arriving home, Darcy has Bob fetch some Perrier while she waits for him upstairs, ostensibly for sex. However, when Bob arrives, Darcy pushes him down the stairs, breaking his arm, neck, and back. She then manages to shove a plastic bag and a dish cloth down his throat, killing him. After removing the evidence of murder, Darcy manages to convince the authorities and the children that Bob died in a drunken accident, and isn't suspected of committing any foul play. Darcy assumes the ordeal is over. However, not long after Bob is buried, a retired detective named Holt Ramsey visits the house. Ramsey spent years investigating the Beadie murders and had questioned Bob. Ramsey tells Darcy that he suspected Bob was the killer, since his Chevrolet Suburban was seen in the vicinity of each victim. Darcy realizes that Ramsey has figured out her role in Bob's death. Once she admits the truth, Ramsey assures her that she \\"did the right thing\\" and leaves; before he does, she tells him about Delahanty. Darcy realizes that Bob was close to being caught and wasn't as smart as he thought he was. She also finds that she can now be at peace with herself. Background In the afterword for Full Dark, No Stars, King stated that the character of Bob Anderson was inspired by Dennis Rader, the infamous \\"BTK Killer\\". Like Rader, Anderson gruesomely tortures and kills his victims, then mails his victims' identification to the police; Anderson's victims, like Rader's, are women and children. Also like Rader, Anderson is a pillar of the community who is well regarded by his friends and colleagues. King said that he felt inspired to write the story after the public outcry against Rader's wife, Paula, who had been married to him for thirty-four years yet seemed to have no knowledge of his crimes. Film adaptation On May 19, 2012, it was announced that Will Battersby and Peter Askin were producing an adaptation of A Good Marriage with Askin directing Stephen King's screenplay of his own novella. On September 11, 2012, Joan Allen was announced as the lead in the film. Anthony LaPaglia and Stephen Lang were later added to the cast.  Reception  Terrence Rafferty of The New York Times wrote, \\"King works the double motifs deftly and guides the narrative to a satisfyingly cathartic climax — after which he supplies a nifty denouement\\". Bill Sheehan of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Through his mastery of detail and his deceptively effortless narrative voice, King transforms this disquieting material into a disturbing, fascinating book.\\" Tim Martin of The Daily Telegraph wrote that the story starts off with a familiar premise but ends \\"with some far more troubling and resonant points about justice and forgiveness\\". Doug Johnstone of The Independent called the story \\"King at his absolute best\\".

IFI program A prisoner's participation in the IFI began 24 to 18 months before his or her scheduled release. Phases one and two occurred during the prisoner's incarceration; phase one concerned what the program referred to as the inmate's \\"personal values and thought processes and encourages the development of spiritual and moral filters.\\" The program stated that the second phase \\"tests the inmate's value system in real-life settings and prepares him/her for life after prison.

For instance the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings directly referred to Jesus instead of using the phrase \\"higher power.\\" The program considered drug addiction to be a sin instead of a disease. The program told prisoners that homosexuality, masturbation, and premarital sexual intercourse were sins. In order to graduate from IFI, one had to be employed for six months after he was released, as well as meet with a trained local mentor, and attend a pro-social group. Some IFI prisoners were involved in Habitat for Humanity projects.

The study considered the IFI participants and a control group. 177 prisoners participated in the IFI program, and 75 of those prisoners graduated. In order to graduate, a prisoner was required to continue participating in the program after his release, including complying with the employment requirement.

According to Kleiman, when first encountering the study, he stated that he thought \\"This is interesting. Those look like good recidivism numbers, and good recidivism numbers are hard to find.\\" Upon examining the study, Kleiman concluded that IFI selected prisoners who were already motivated and disciplined and more likely to succeed to participate in the program. Kleiman said that the study \\"gives you this happy horseshit about the graduates, but if you look at the 'intent to treat,' it's a loser.\\" Kleiman stated that he was not opposed to the IFI program, but that he was opposed to the study.Nowell, Scott. \\"Doing Time.\\" Houston Press.

Kleiman criticized the promoters of the program, saying \\"Anything that selects out from a group of ex-inmates those who hold jobs is going to look like a miracle cure\\" and \\"The InnerChange cheerleaders simply ignored the other 102 participants who dropped out, were kicked out or got early parole and didn't finish. If you select out the winners, you leave mostly losers.\\" Chuck Colson responded to Kleiman's article. Colson accused the article of being an attack against Bush and his promotion of faith-based programs. Scott Nowell of the Houston Press said that \\"Colson didn't really address Kleiman's argument of selection bias.\\" Jerry Bryan, a chaplain who participated in the program, said that it would not be fair to consider the people who did not graduate the program in determining whether or not the program is a success. Bryan said \\"There's a pool of people who don't get anything. That shouldn't count against us. Many offenders volunteer for all the wrong reasons. The most prevalent is 'I'll get more visits.'\\" Nowell stated that \\"no one outside the Christian community is making much of an argument with Kleiman's position -- not even the study's author, Byron Johnson. Johnson has declined all media requests since Kleiman's story appeared.\\" The Houston Press asked Scott Phillips, a Rice University assistant professor of sociology, to examine the Penn study. Phillips concluded that \\"Considering all participants, IFI does not reduce recidivism. Considering the graduates, IFI leads to a dramatic reduction in recidivism. Is it appropriate to just consider graduates? No.\\" He added, \\"Even the most rigorous evaluation would probably conclude that IFI has real benefits for the small number of inmates who are both interested in the program and complete the program. But at this point it's impossible to be sure.\\" Nowell stated that the Christians involved in the IFI program in the Vance Unit support the program and do not regard the results of the study. Kleiman stated that the participants were \\"not trying to achieve statistical significance, they're interested in individual salvation.\\" Responding to the point, Nowell said \\"The men who have stuck with InnerChange exhibit an air of calmness and stability not often found in those who've done time in Texas.

The Comprehensive Rural Health Project (CRHP) is a non profit, non- governmental organization located in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar District in the state of Maharashtra, India. The organization works with rural communities to provide community-based primary healthcare and improve the general standard of living through a variety of community-led development programs, including Women's Self-Help Groups, Farmers' Clubs, Adolescent Programs and Sanitation and Watershed Development Programs. CRHP was founded in 1970 by Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole, who conceived the organization's model while on a Fulbright Scholarship at Johns Hopkins University. The work of CRHP has been recognized by the WHO and UNICEF, as well as being introduced to 178 countries across the world. History =Founders: Raj and Mabelle Arole= Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole came from very different backgrounds but found unity in common purpose. Raj Arole, born in 1935, was raised in the village of Rahuri in Ahmednagar District. In contrast, Mabelle Immanuel, born in Jabalpur in 1935, led a secluded and secure life at the college campus where her father was a professor. Mabelle & Raj met during their studies at Christian Medical College, Vellore and graduated in 1959, with Mabelle topping her class and Raj coming second. They found each other in their common purpose of serving the poor and marginalized and were married in April 1960, vowing to each other to devote their lives to this cause. Before founding CRHP in 1970, the couple worked in the Marathi Mission Hospital in Vadala from 1962-1966 and spent time in the US completing their medicine & surgery residencies as well as obtaining MPH degrees at Johns Hopkins University. The idea of CRHP was born during the Aroles’ time at Johns Hopkins and was also based on their prior experiences with the rural poor. They realized that they were seeing the same problems over and over again without producing a solution to the root cause of the ailments they were treating. With this in mind, the Aroles realized the narrow scope of curative medicine was not enough to improve the lives of their patients in a meaningful way. The Aroles decided that they needed to provide holistic care and create empowering framework that galvanized communities to come together to solve their problems sustainably. Over 40 years later, their Jamkhed Model lives on and has been regarded as the most successful template for community-based health and development the world has seen. =The Beginning= To understand the link between poverty and health, the Aroles decided to live on the same amount of money that an average village family earned, which was approximately US $7.00 per month [5]. By doing this, they realized that securing food and water was much more important for the people of Jamkhed, than the practice of good public health [6]. The Aroles reached out to donor agencies that funded food-for work programs. Citizens were employed as daily wage laborers to build dams and were paid one bag of grain per week [7]. Health and wellness lessons, and discussions of home-based, low cost prevention and care programs to enhance children’s nutrition, prevent diarrhea, and control pneumonia were provided in conjunction with these construction projects [7]. By providing basic medical care to workers and their children, the Aroles established an initial trust with the residents of Jamkhed. From there, the Aroles were able to start their mission of instituting trained health workers in the villages [1][7]. CRHP Model CRHP’s model, known in the development community as the “Jamkhed Model”, is centered around mobilizing and building the capacity of the community, empowering the people to bring about their own improvements in health and poverty-alleviation. The model has three, mutually supportive components: 1\\\\. Village Health Workers and Community Groups The Village Health Worker (VHW), usually illiterate and of low caste, is the key change agent for CRHP’s comprehensive approach to health improvement. Selected by the communities themselves and trained by CRHP, VHWs not only act as health workers and midwives but they also mobilize their communities to achieve better sanitation, hygiene, family planning, and maternal and infant health. When a village agrees to work with CRHP, the whole village comes together to choose a woman to be trained as their VHW. VHWs initially receive extensive training on CRHP’s campus. Over half of the training time is dedicated to personal development in order to build self-esteem, confidence, and skills necessary for community organization and effective communication. The rest of the training is spent developing clinical knowledge and skills that equip the women to function as primary health care workers. The VHWs come together weekly for CRHP-based training to review skills, share stories, and update statistics. VHWs provide basic preventive healthcare and knowledge to their villages and help organize and facilitate Women’s Groups and the Adolescent Girls Programs. VHWs also provide a great deal of care to pregnant women and new mothers. They educate women on nutrition during pregnancy and proper breastfeeding practices. In addition, they examine the pregnant women and monitor the progress of the fetus. VHWs are fully equipped to perform home deliveries and will also accompany women to a hospital delivery if they chose to do so or it is medically necessary. 2\\\\. Mobile Health Team The Mobile Heath Team (MHT) found its beginnings in the outreach efforts of founders, Mabelle and Raj Arole, and today serves as the bridge between the community and CRHP’s on-campus medical and development staff. Historically, villagers have had neither the time, nor the resources to travel all the way to the hospital in Jamkhed for care, and as a result, healthcare was brought to them. In order to build trust and confidence, the original outreach team provided curative services via weekly clinics in the villages, and as rapport was built, the original team developed into the MHT. Today the team possesses a broad array of capacities including health promotion, preventive health services, social work, development projects, and community organization. The Mobile Health Team consists of a driver, social workers, a paramedic, and on certain occasions, a physician. However, these distinctions tend to be in name only, and all team members are trained as fully as possible in all jobs and tasks. All team members address patients’ clinical and social questions, and are considered equals with each member given respect and importance. The integration of the team and skill sharing allows for flexibility, and creates a resiliency in our system in the face of unpredictable absences, and personnel shortages. The Mobile Health Team helps train Village Health Workers and work side by side with them to provide health services to project villages. MHT members help lead and provide support for the Adolescent Boys and Girls Programs, Women’s Self-Help Groups, and Farmers’ Clubs. In addition, the MHT members work with trainees and researchers from all over the world to collect village data and educate others about the Jamkhed Model. 3\\\\. Julia Hospital The first hospital at CRHP was created in the 1970s by Drs. Raj and Mabelle Arole to meet the need for medical services in Jamkhed and to build trust in the surrounding communities. When the Aroles first arrived in Jamkhed, they planned to stay a few years, set up a mobile hospital, remedy the health situation, and move on to another area. As the need for medical care surpassed their expectations and the number of patients increased, the need for a permanent hospital did as well. The Old Hospital, built in 1970, served Jamkhed block for 35 years. As CRHP became more involved in secondary care and conducted more surgeries, the need for an even more advanced hospital increased, and in 2009, with the help of a donor, the Julia Hospital was built for USD $1.7 million, including all equipment. The Julia Hospital has 50 beds, three operating theaters, a lab, a maternity ward, an Intensive Care Unit, an X-ray lab, a labor room, and a pharmacy. It serves a rural, underserved population of roughly 500,000 individuals. Impact and Outcomes In the Villages: The health workers were not accepted quickly. It took months or years for a village to start listening, and it was the dramatic decrease in both infant and child mortality rates that helped to cement the role of the village health worker. The women were also supported by a mobile team, established by CRHP. The team was composed of a nurse, paramedic, social worker, and sometimes a doctor. They would visit each village every week in the beginning, then less and less often, only treating the hardest cases. This team was created to not only tackle the most severe illnesses of the villagers, but to reinforce the authority of the Village Health Worker [2][10][11]. Village Health Workers receive intensive training from CRHP in primary health care and health promotion, including family planning, women’s and children’s health and home- birth delivery. Training is also provided in personal and community development, organization and communication skills. These workers share knowledge about health in their respective communities through discussion groups and household visits. During discussions with community members, Village Health Workers address issues such as child care, family planning (contraception use increased from less than 0.5% in 1970, to nearly 60% as on 1999), adequate birth spacing, nutrition, hygiene, sanitation and safe drinking water [9]. They are given a small medical kit and a birthing kit [7]. These women are capable of administering basic remedies and medications, performing safe deliveries, and detecting and referring high-risk pregnancies and deliveries to the CRHP hospital [12]. With the institution of these workers, there has been a significant reduction in child malnutrition, diarrhea, pneumonia, leprosy, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, along with other common diseases associated with standing water from the lack of sanitation and liquid waste disposal systems [6]. Despite these improvement in health care, come problems with this health care worker model were encountered in the villages. Husbands would refuse to allow their wives to become a Village Health Worker or to receive treatment from one. Some women took their new-found sense of freedom and abandoned their husbands and families. In some cases, the Village Health Worker would illegally sell the drugs to the highest bidder or refuse to give treatment without payment. While women were chosen to be health workers through a town consensus, some villages refused to decide and would not accept the new model. In addition, not all women were able to travel to the Jamkhed facility for training. Often, the young woman’s town would be too far away and there would be no bus available. During the monsoon season, very few women could reach the facility at all [7]. Maternal and Child care: Superstition was one of the first obstacles the Village Health Workers had to face. Infant and maternal mortality, along with many other diseases, increased because of such beliefs. To villagers in the Jamkhed area, disease came from the gods [2]. If a new mother died in childbirth, the child was then killed. Villagers saw the mother as unclean, and the child, therefore, unclean. Many cases of maternal death resulted from infections by dirty instruments during the delivery. CRHP trained the Village Health Workers particularly in the methods pregnancy care, such as monitoring blood-pressure and checking for anemia, and in safe and hygienic childbirth. There were other widely accepted superstitions surrounding basic nutrition for pregnant women. They were told not to eat very much, and new mothers would wait several days before starting to breastfeed [2]. The effect of CRHP on childhood mortality, measured from September 1992 to December 2007, showed a 30% reduction in the hazard of child death after the neonatal period for CRHP villages, as compared with villages in the control area. The reduction was significant at the 5% level [12]. Since its conception, CRHP reduced the infant mortality rate from over 200/1000 to approximately 20/1000 (less than half of the figure for the rural area of the state of Maharashtra), with 95% being “safe deliveries” out of the 79% (data for 1999-2003) of home deliveries [2][6][13]. A research project to measure malnutrition and illness among children under five in fifteen CRHP villages, conducted from October to December 2002, showed that malnutrition was less than 15%, while the average for India is greater than 50%. Immunization rates were 99% for measles, DPT, and OPV vaccinations in CRHP villages [14]. Empowering Women: The Aroles believed that preventative medicine begins by identifying the root of the problem. Gender inequality was one of the first major targets CRHP wanted to attack [7]. Most female villagers were married before the age of 10, started having children before 14, were beaten by their husbands (according to a 1996 UNICEF survey, up to 45% of men in India acknowledged physically abusing their wives), and eventually abandoned by them [2][11]. In each village, the Aroles asked the Village Health Worker to form an Adolescent Girls Program. The program teaches girls, ages 12–18, health education and personal development, and self- defense, and fosters discussion and creative activities in order to promote self-esteem and a sense of empowerment [15]. As a result, more women are postponing marriage until 18, the use of contraception and voluntary hysterectomies have reduced family size, and more girls are attending school [2]. Additionally, CRHP helps village women to receive micro-credit loans from local banks and provides them a means to become economically independent. The loans allow the women to earn their own living, generally by selling vegetables or raising farm animals [9]. The Aroles chose young women as Village Health Workers to begin the process of breaking down gender inequality, but contributing factors are still heavily present—socioeconomic class, son preference, early marriage and pregnancy, and violence. Qualitative research of Jamkhed’s surrounding area has supported the success of these programs. Adolescent Girl Program members are seen to have more knowledge about nutrition, reproductive health, maternal health, hygiene, and sanitation, and are found to have healthier weights and other health indicators, as compared to non-members [3][8][15]. A 2010 study used qualitative methods and surveyed 18 Village Health Workers and found 6 themes consistent with a successful approach to empowering women. These included trusted sources of knowledge, effective learning methods and environment(s), qualities of effective Village Health Workers, defeating stigma, empowerment through critical assessment and community organizing, and motivation to serve [16].

Eitz Yosef commentary to Leviticus Rabbah 25:6. Zohar vol. 1 p. 86b) Chaim ibn Attar says that God was not angered by Melchizedek's preceding Abram's blessing to that of God, since Abram was rightfully deemed worthy of precedence for independently coming to recognize God amidst a world of paganism, but Melchizedek willingly gave the priesthood to Abram upon recognizing his outstanding uniqueness and G-dly character traits (Ohr HaChaim to Genesis 14:18) who passed it on to his son Isaac who in turn passed it on to his son Jacob. Jacob's deathbed blessing of Levi Maimonides, in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that Jacob separated his son Levi from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of service to God, specifically the methods used by his forefather Abraham, to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of the tribe of Levi for eternity (Maimonides, On Idolatry 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see Targum Jonathan to Genesis 32:25, and Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer ch. 37. In midrash it is written that Amram the son of Kohath the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob during their Egyptian Bondage. Following his death, his post was assumed by his firstborn Aaron. =Exodus= At the time of the erection of the Tabernacle, God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his shechinah glory amongst the nation of Israel; With the appearance that Aaron -by his own right- was worthy of the privilege of priesthood, the midrash clarifies that in fact it was due to the support and guidance of Moshe that afforded him the necessary qualifications for the Kohanic duties. The priestly duties prior to Aaron Prior to the appointing of Aaron and his sons to function as priests it was customary amongst the congregation of Israel that, just as all professions attract certain character types who excel therein, the duty of priesthood was best served by the firstborn of each household. As it is the firstborn who is, by nature, inclined and qualified to be an \\"emissary of the congregation\\" in the eyes of God. According to the Targum Yosef to Books of Chronicles, individuals from the Tribe of Reuben (the firstborn of Jacob) where leading as the High priest, up until the establishment of Aaron to the same (Targum Joseph to Books of Chronicles 1 5:1-2). The Golden Calf, and sin of the firstborn Based on Hebrew Bible narrative, the consequence of the sin of the golden calf was the desire by God to annihilate the entire congregation. It was due to the successful prayer of Moses and the retribution meted out by the tribe of Levi from the inciters of the sin that appeased the anger of God. Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno on Deuteronomy 10:8 writes that Moses attempted to convince God that the priesthood should remain with the firstborn but was not successful.Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno to Deuteronomy 10:8 However, the negative consequence of arousing God's anger was that no longer would the priestly service be maintained by the firstborn of each individual family. As quoted by the Jerusalemn Talmud Yerushalmi to Esther 1:11; \\"Said Rabbi Levi, \\"God broke the staff of evildoers (Isaiah 14)\\" - these are the firstborn who sacrificed to the Calf first (and foremost)\\", but will be concentrated in one family as a form of inheritance from father to son.Sifra to Leviticus 7:34 (vol. 1 p. 343 of the \\"Torah VeHamitzvah\\" edition) According to Nahmanides and other Torah commentators, the decision to appoint Aaron and his sons to priestly duty was a unilateral act of God, without the agreement or disagreement being asked of the congregation.Nahmanides on Numbers 16:16, Sifsei Koehin (al HaTorah) vol. 1 p. 546 _____date This decision was not readily accepted by the large majority of the congregation of Israel, and quickly enough began the rebellion led by Korah and followed by the leaders of the tribe of Reuben. Indeed, so powerful was the rebellion that even after the divine punishment of Korah and his followers, other came forth who further demonstrated disagreement and likewise met with divine retribution until saved by Aaron himself, who arrested the plague. Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz writes that the priesthood was taken from Reuben due to his sinning against his father Jacob.Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz on Genesis Kli Yakkar to Bereishit 49:4 __________year ________edition. Based on the Talmudic rule that \\"God and heaven give goodness but do not retract it once given\\" (Zohar Chadash to RuthZohar Chadash to Rut p. 88b. _________year __________edition, likewise quoted by Talmud Bavli \\"משמיא יהבי יהבי, מישקל לא מישקלי\\",) it is explained that the priesthood was never bestowed by God and Heaven to the Bechorim but it was the decision of man to appoint the firstborn to those duties, it is thus applicable that God himself could choose who amongst his creatures are most fitting in his eyes for the priestly service. The firstborn (bechorim) retain their sanctity Albeit the sin of idolatry (Hebrew avodah zarah) committed by the firstborns,bechorim, according to some rabbinical commentators it is clear from the Torah that the firstborn still retained their sanctity. According to Midrash Rabba this is based on the firstborn being referred to by God by the term \\"to me\\" (Hebrew לי). The Midrash Rabba states that all five places where the word \\"to me\\" (לי) is mentioned (in context with God speaking), stays sanctified forever, both in this world and the next. Of the firstborn it is written \\"to me all firstborn\\" (Hebrew לי כל בכור; Medrash rabbah to Leviticus 2:2). The commentators to the midrash point out that even though the firstborn where disqualified from priestly duties, their sanctity was not canceled since they still retain the need to be redeemed from their sanctified state at birth.Etz Yosef and Mahari to Leviticus Rabba 2:2 _______edition? ________date? In addition, there are some Torah commentarians that explain the firstborn retains a state of sanctity in terms that it is required of him, even after being redeemed, to be more knowleadgable in Torah law and nuances than the average Jew, and to be diligent in engaging in Torah study.Sforno to Exodus 22:28, Elazar Shach to the Torah vol. 1 p. 280 _____date? God's reason for choosing Aaron Jewish commentaries on the Bible give various reasons to the logic behind the divine choice of Aharon and his sons for the priesthood. Hezekiah ben Manoah explained that it was the desire of God that the priesthood rest with one specific family in order that the father of the household instill in his children the duties of the priesthood, and have his children exposed to those ideas, as a family way of life, from birth and throughout life, in order to be successful at their priestly duties. This not being the case with the firstborn (as each family could produce only one firstborn) as it is likely that the father of the firstborn not be a firstborn himself, making his knowledge of priesthood minimal and thus not being able to teach priesthood to his child. Maimonides explained that Levi (grandfather of Aaron, was already chosen and sanctified by Jacob himself to service in duties relating to priesthood, and Aaron's appointment being a divine affirmation of Jacob's choice. David Pardo explained that in Tosefta it is explained that selectively choosing one group of servants to the King (God) exemplifies and portrays the grandeur of the King by showing that not all could merely \\"show up\\" and begin serving.David Pardo Chasdei Dovid commentary to Tosefta to bava Batra 2:4 The Jerusalem Targum attributes the choosing of Aaron due to the meritorious actions of Jochebed, who saved the male Jewish infants from the infanticide decree laid forth by Pharaoh (Jerusalem Targum to Exodus 2:21). The Medrash Rabbah explains that since Kehoth, the son of Levi, merited to carry the Ark of the Covenant and Aaron himself being the firstborn from amongst his grandchildren, thus Aaron merited the priesthood along with the title \\"Holy of Holys\\" (1 Chronicles 23:13) by way of patrilineal inheritance (Bamidbar Rabbah 6:2). From a more abstract Kabbalah point of view, there are some Torah commentarians, such as Elazar Shach, that explain the priesthood as belonging to Aaron from the six days of creation.Elazar Shach on the Torah vol. 2 p. 355 Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno, on the verse \\"and to stand before the congregation and serve them\\" comments that one of the reasons for God's choosing of the tribe of Levi in general was to cause envy to the congregation for partaking in the sin of the Golden Calf.Sforno on Numbers 16:9 _____ date In the written Torah The written Law (Torah SheBichtav) which Maimonides called the \\"everlasting Torah\\"Maimonides - 13 Principles of faith of the Rambam _____date forbids \\"the foreigner who is not from the offspring of Aaron\\" to offer the Ketoret offering on the inner altar of burnt offering. The Law also instructs the children of Aaron to scrupulously guard the sanctity of the altar and not allow a foreigner from bringing an offering thereon (Numbers 18:7), and describes the priestly covenant as an \\"eternal covenant.\\" In the book of Malachi, a prophetic vision is put forth portraying the sudden appearance of God in Jerusalem and the Temple, and his immediate busying with purifying his servants, the children of Levi; The destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, 70 CE The destruction of Jerusalem by the army of Titus in 70 CE caused the cessation of animal sacrifices and other aspects of the priesthood's function in Judaism. =The cessation of the priesthood's work in the Second Temple= Model of the Second Temple with a view of the \\"Heichal\\" (The central tall structure) At the destruction of the First Temple, the Talmud narrates how the young priests went atop the Heichal with the keys to the Heichal in hand and called out \\"master of the universe, since we were not fortunate to be reliable caretakers, let the keys be given to you\\" upon completion they heaved the keys upward -towards heaven, when a hand came forth from heaven and took the keys. Following, those young priests jumped into the inferno below. Following this destruction of the temple, the arrest of priestly activities therein, along with the of the Davidic line, came forth verbatim from the masses that announced the God became disgusted with \\"the two family dynasties\\" -The houses of Aaron and David; The Jewish priesthood in the Third Temple =Vision of Jeremiah= As a response to the verbatim that God permanently retracted his preference to these two dynasties, the prophet Jeremiah prophesied that the priesthood, as being the lot of Aaron, is everlasting and will not cease forever, and the priests will return to the priestly service with greater grandeur; This vision, Jeremiah goes on to intertwine with the central existence of the nation of Israel; \\"if these covenants cease from before me, says God, so too the seed of Israel will cease to be a nation before me all of the days (Jeremiah 31:35). The commentators point out that these particular visions of Jeremiah did not come forth in the days of the Second Temple, since therein the Davidic line was not established and the priesthood was not in a state of splendor, but the vision of Jeremiah is one destined for the priestly service in the Third Temple, and the kingdom of the king Messiah - as Jeremiah finishes; \\"than will rejoice the virgin in dance and young men and elders together.. and I will infatuate the souls of the priests with abundance and my nation; my best they will be satiated with (Jeremiah 31:12-13)\\". =The Third temple in Ezekiel= The prophet Ezekiel introduced a prophecy not recorded in any other book of the Hebrew Bible. Ezekiel writes that in the Third Temple the priestly family of the sons of Zadok will officiate all services involving the sacrifice of fats and blood on the altar. They will also enjoy an exclusive chamber in the courtyard of the House from amongst the multiple chambers therein; specifically, their chamber will have its entrance facing the North whereas all others chamber entrances face South. These privileges are cited as being given to the priests of the sons of Zadok due to their staunch non-involvement with any form of idol worship, while other families, including the priests, submitted to those forbidden services. =The Third temple in the Zohar= The Zohar Chadash describes the priesthood as one of five covenants listed in the Law (Zohar Chadash 4b), in the Aramaic Compendium on the Book of Exodus it is also listed as one of six unique blessings that God is destined to return to the nation of Israel.Mechilta on Yitro (parsha) ch. 1 According to Sifra it is likewise listed as one of five items that God calls \\"to me\\" (Hebrew לי) a term that connotes an eternal choice as God himself is eternal (Sifri 167a). Sifra teaches that following the coming of the Messiah, Aaron and his sons will not require holy anointing oil to serve as the anointing done by Moses in the Tabernacle will be considered as being in effect (Sifra 1.343). The Sifra and Talmud Yerushalmi explain that it is not applicable to say that just as the priesthood was removed from the priesthood and given to Aaron it is possible, in the future, that it will be removed from Aaron and returned to the firstborn, but the priesthood is and will remain the lot of Aaron and his sons for eternity.Sifra vol. 1 p. 343, Talmud Yerushalmi to Sisters in Law 8:6 The Babylonian Talmud presents that the eternity of the priesthood belonging to Aaron is exemplified by the notion that Ahron himself will be present to accept terumah following the coming of the Messiah.Talmud Bavli to Sanhedrin and Rashi (תחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר והרמיתם ממנו תרומת ה' לאהרן הכהן וכי אהרן לעולם קיים? ..עתידים ליתן לו תרומה..) The Tosefta narrates that at the time of the concealment of the Ark of the Covenant, the Aaron's rod, with its flowering almond sprouts, was included, thus symbolizing the flowering of Aaron's priesthood once the Ark will be revealed.Tosefta Sotah 13:2, Likkutei Sichot vol. 23 p. 122 In addition to the title \\"an eternal covenant of priesthood,\\" the tractate Animal Sacrifices explains that when God contributes an authoritative position to an individual it is for eternity.Tractate Zevachim p. 102a ( רבי אלעזר אמר רבי חנינא בשעה שפוסקים גדולה לאדם פוסקים לו ולזרעו עד סוף כל הדורות שנאמר \\"לא יגרע מצדיק עיניו ואת מלכים לכסא\\" (איוב לו:נא - .) Furthering the notion that it is not plausible that the priesthood will be revoked from the tribe of Levi as it was revoked from the firstborn.Numbers Rabbah 4:8 and \\"Eshed HaNechalim\\" commentary thereof =The Third Temple in Torah Commentaries= Jacob ben Asher on the threefold repetition of the words \\"and they will serve me\\" explains this as symbolic that the priests will in the future serve a third time, in the Third Temple. He also opines that the priesthood will not return to Aaron's sons in the Messianic age.Baal HaTurim on Leviticus 16:14 The aggadic compilation Yalkut Shimoni relates an occurrence where a Kritis queries Rabbi Yossi as to the destruction of the second temple and cessation of sacrifices (Korbanot) which seemingly disprove the words of the prophet Jeremiah describing the Kohanim of serving God \\"all of the days\\". Rabbi Yossi replied that the prophetic vision of the Kohanim serving \\"all of the days\\" is in reference to the physical sacrifices in the temple, but to the Torah study by the Kohen of Torah Laws delving on the sacrifices (Mishnayot Kodoshim laws).Yalkut Shimoni vol. 8 (ha'maor edition) p.545 =The priesthood in the Messianic era= With the priesthood being portrayed in the Hebrew Bible and Chazalic writings as being the eternal lot of the \\"Home of Aaron\\" (בית אהרן\\"), the written recordings of Rabbi Chaim Vital of his master Rabbi Yitzchok Luria (the Arizal) introduce an idea that in the Age to Come (Hebrew LeAtid Lavoh \\"the Messianic era\\") the souls belonging to the spiritual rootsource of Kayin, which are essentially the souls of the firstborn and Levites, will become clear and purified and will thus merit to serve in the Third Temple. This idea is exegesized from the verse \\"אם תטיב שאת\\" (if you will better yourself you will be uplifted) explained as when you will better yourself you will merit to the priesthood which is titled \\"שאת\\" (uplifted).Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572) vol. 7 p. 240, vol. 10 (Shaar Hagilgulum) p. 104 and 153, Gate of Reincarnations \\"Sefer HaGilgulim\\" ch. 23 p 19 ________edition? ________year?

And his successor, the third Lubavitch Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneersohn.See Sefer HaLikkutim vol. 2 p. 304 Likewise, Chaim ibn Attar in his commentary to Jacob's blessing to his son Reuben (\\"בכורי אתה\\" you are my firstborn) writes that in the Age to Come the firstborn will work alongside the priests in the Third TempleChaim ibn Attar on Genesis 49:28. Of note is Chaim ibn Attar's subsequent writing to Numbers 3:45, where he emphasizes that the tribe of Levi will eternally never be demoted from their duties. The idea is further quoted by Ithamar HaKohen with the explanation that in the Age to Come the sin of the Golden Calf will be rectified thus allowing the firstborn to work alongside the priests in the Third Temple.Ithamar HaKohen \\"Semuchim L'ad\\" p. 10a ________?

There, Rabbi Schneerson explains that the future change as presented in Hasidic Judaism and Kabbalah will appear purely on a spiritual level, with the soul of the Levi (i.e. those souls stemming from the rootsource of Cain) being born into the physical bodies of the sons of Aaron.

Barrows, as all other sources give his first name was Egbert. Dr. Egbert Storr Barrows Barrows was a native of Middlebury, Vermont and he studied medicine in Frankfort, Kentucky. He was a surgeon in the United States Army during the Seminole Wars. When he first came to Iowa he settled in Rockingham before settling in the nascent community of Davenport in 1836. Barrows was the first person to practice medicine in Scott County and the second person in all of the Wisconsin Territory. He had a seemingly odd medical philosophy as he advised his friends and patients to leave doctors \\"severely alone and take as little medicine as possible.\\" with In 1856 he helped to establish the Scott County Medical Society. Barrows had this house built around 1850. He was one of the few people in the city's early years who was able to afford the style on a large scale. Barrows died in 1892 and at some point the house was divided into apartments, and stucco covered the fieldstone exterior. It had become a derelict property by the early 1970s.

It is considered one of the most powerful handgun cartridges designed in terms of kinetic energy and power factor (momentum). History The .500 Linebaugh cartridge was designed by John Linebaugh of Maryville, Missouri, in 1986. John Linebaugh had been converting .45 Colt six-shooters to five-shot revolvers, thus offering a stronger cylinder which could withstand the firing of higher-pressure .45 Colt ammunition. While this venture was successful, he continued to search for a more powerful cartridge, which resulted in the .500 Linebaugh. The cartridge case itself was designed by cutting off the .348 Winchester case to , turning the rim to a diameter of and opening the case mouth to accept a .510 caliber (12.95 mm) bullet. The first revolvers converted to use the .500 Linebaugh were the Ruger Bisley and the Seville revolvers. Due to the demise of the Seville revolvers in the early 1990s, all subsequent conversions have been carried out on revolvers based on the Ruger Bisley frame. It was when the supply of .348 Winchester cases started running out that John Linebaugh began working on the .475 Linebaugh, which could be formed from the more available .45-70 Government cases. When the Winchester Model 71 was reintroduced in the .348 Winchester, the ability to form .500 Linebaugh cases became again feasible. Today, Starline and Buffalo Bore offer .500 Linebaugh cases which are not dependent on the supply of .348 Winchester cases. Cartridge design and specifications The .500 Linebaugh is a proprietary cartridge and thus has not been adopted by mainline firearms manufacturers. Currently the only firearm manufacturer that produces a revolver for this cartridge is Magnum Research (owned by Kahr Firearms Group), in the BFR product line. Prior to January 2019, the only alternative was to have a gunsmith such as John Linebaugh of Linebaugh Custom Six guns and Hamilton Bowen of Bowen Classic Arms convert pre-existing revolvers such as the Ruger Blackhawk and Bisley to fire the cartridge. Hamilton Bowen has been known to have converted the Ruger Redhawk double-action revolver for use with this cartridge. :.500 Linebaugh SAAMI cartridge dimensions - all dimensions in inches (mm) Due to the proprietary status of the cartridge neither the CIP nor SAAMI have published official specifications for the cartridge. As is the case, there can be some variations from gunsmith to gunsmith. No pressure standard has been published for the cartridge but according to Linebaugh pressures levels between and are considered safe in the converted revolvers. The cartridge uses .510 in. (12.95 mm) diameter jacketed bullets or .511-.512 in. (12.98-13.01 mm) lead bullets. Sporting usage The .500 Linebaugh was designed as a hunting cartridge but would also make excellent backup firearm in areas where large bears may be encountered; particularly in Alaska. It was designed to fire a bullet at . This particular loading generates of energy making this one of the most powerful handgun cartridges put into production. In terms of energy, this is comparable to the .454 Casull cartridge. However, the .500 Linebaugh provides a larger diameter, heavier bullet with a greater sectional density than the .454 Casull.

It should be distinguished from the openADR standards that were promoted to ensure open access to customer electricity use data by all service providers.  Utility rationale  A major rationale for a single set of standards is for the utilities themselves to provide a unified home energy monitor that \\"provides prompt, convenient feedback on electrical or other energy use. Devices may also display cost of energy used, and estimates of greenhouse gas emissions. Various studies have shown a reduction in home energy use of 4-15% through use of home energy display. Electricity use may be measured with an inductive clamp placed around the electric main, via the electric meter (either through an optical port, or by sensing the meters actions), by communicating with a smart meter, or by direct connection to the electrical system.\\" Such reductions are contingent on every smart appliance reporting to a single central monitor. In the US, the National Broadband Plan emphasized (in its \\"goal 6\\") that consumers must be able to share usage data with literally any service provider, not just their electric distributor, who must then be able to provide simple instructions or direct remote control of the consumer's residential appliances and home grid. Utilities accordingly have been motivated to remain ahead of the technology curve and aggressively roll out these capabilities internally. \\"With increasing investments in smart meters and the smart grid, these systems have the capability of integrating AMI/MDM data from multiple vendor sources. Progress reports can be provided online and by mail, and outbound messaging can be Web-based and/or SMS text- based for maximum reach. When integrated with the billing process for either print or online presentment, the utility can communicate to the customer valuable information to increase the understanding of energy use, its drivers, how to save, and comparisons to standards in their area.\\" = Architecture = Perhaps reflecting utility influence, OpenHAN was one of the original NIST smart grid standards sanctioned for by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Unlike most other networking standards, it uses in-home wiring between AC-powered devices. It primarily relies on AC powerline networking as defined by IEEE 1901 and packet management under ITU G.hn. The closest DC equivalent is power over ethernet (PoE). These are used for smart thermostats and other smart appliances, put power and data all on one wire, and similarly have about one gigabit capacity. Unlike PoE which requires cat5 or cat6 ethernet wiring redundant with the AC wiring, OpenHAN makes use of all existing wire (AC outlets, cable coax and telephone cat3). In the OpenHAN architecture, \\"The display portion is remote from the measurement, communicating with the sensor using a cable, power-line communications, or using radio. Online displays are also available which allow the user to display near real-time consumption on any device that can connect to the Internet. These displays can reduce household energy consumption by providing real-time feedback to homeowners so they can change their energy using behavior. A study using the PowerCost Monitor deployed in 500 Ontario homes by Hydro One showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. Hydro One subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot. Blue Line Innovations also indicates 100,000 units in the market today.\\" Other customer relationship management tactics can be used to reinforce and encourage reduction of energy use, including using direct outbound messages. According to the utilities involved, all smart appliances and smart meters (which also must meet openADR standards for energy demand management) must meet the OpenHAN standard. Its appliance interface connector is meant to ensure that all openHAN devices can communicate with each other. The energy services interface defines how energy use is managed. Implementing companies include Synapse, the ZigBee and HomePlug consortia, Trilliant, United Illuminating, Ingersoll-Rand and others closely affiliated with the utilities and seeking to sell them more equipment.

Founded in 1987, the press is named after Orange Frazer, an Ohio man who ran a grocery store in Wilmington with his brother, John. Frazer also traveled the world, clerked for the Ohio Supreme Court, and collected enough books to create the county's largest library. The company's motto is \\"Your Story, Beautifully Told.\\"http://www.orangefrazer.com/cgi-bin/disp.cgi?pg=About_Us, http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2010/07/12/story13.html  History  John Baskin and Marcy Hawley both worked at Ohio Magazine in the 1980s, where they accumulated a wealth of minutiae about the Buckeye State. They founded Orange Frazer in order to use the 48 file drawers' worth of information they had, and eventually did so with Ohio Matters of Fact, the company's first published work. The pair sold the books on their own to independent bookstores, and eventually it went through four printings.http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher- news/article/44383-the-two-sides-of-orange-frazer.html Subsequent works included Woody's Boys: 20 Famous Buckeyes Talk Amongst Themselves, a 1995 book about Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes, as well as biographies of Ohio sports figures Johnny Bench, Chad Johnson, and Joe Nuxhall. The Hayes book sold over 25,000 copies, while each of the subsequent biographies sold 20,000 or more. Today, Orange Frazer Press is Ohio's largest independent book publisher. The company specializes in two niches: regional nonfiction and custom publishing.  Publication statistics  Orange Frazer's subjects generally focus on Ohio, though they have also published works outside of this local scope. First printings range in size from 250 up to 30,000 copies, with commercial projects averaging 3,000 to 5,000. In 2010, ten of the company's 13 releases were custom publications, meaning that the books were privately commissioned and then produced with assistance from Orange Frazer in marketing methods, content production, distribution, etc. Thus far, the company has created over 100 books in this way. In total, the company has published over 300 commercial and custom titles. Orange Frazer developed four study guides for the Ohio Graduation Tests, tests that every high school student in Ohio must take to graduate. The books were only sold in schools, rather than traditional bookstores, and were written with input from the teachers around the state with backgrounds in math, science, social studies and reading. The project has helped Orange Frazer produce $1.3 million in sales for each of the last two years.http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2010/07/12/story13.html?page=2  Highlights of published work  * Chad: I Can't Be Stopped by Paul Daugherty * Before Oprah: Ruth Lyons, The Woman Who Created Talk TV, by Michael Banks * Rags to Riches: The Story of CINTAS by Richard T.

Location Bugesera Airport is located in southeastern Rwanda, in Bugesera District, near the town of Rilima. This location is approximately , by air, and about , by road, south of Kigali International Airport. The approximate coordinates of Bugesera International Airport are: 02°08'09.0\\"S, 30°11'00.0\\"E (Latitude:-2.135833; Longitude:30.183333). Bugesera International Airport is situated at an altitude of above sea level. Overview Bugesera International Airport will become Rwanda's largest International Airport, serving commercial flights destined to and from the greater Kigali metropolitan area. When completed, it will become Rwanda's third International Airport, and the country's 8th airport overall. It will complement Kigali International Airport, which is now operating at maximum capacity. The airport will initially have a single paved runway. During the second phase of construction, a second runway will be added. The estimated cost for Phase I is US$418 million, while Phase II is budgeted to cost US$382 million, for a total of US$800 million. It was anticipated that Phase I will be completed in 2018. The British engineering firm, TPS Consult Plc., was commissioned to carry out a feasibility study and design the new airport. Subsequent phases will follow with higher passenger and cargo capacities. In November 2010, press reports indicated that the Rwanda government had retained the International accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to provide financial advice and lead the search for funding of the project. The government wants to develop Bugesera Airport as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project. In December 2019, Qatar Airways agreed to take a 60 percent stake in the airport. As per the Rwanda Development Board, first phase of construction would provide facilities for seven million passengers a year. And, the second phase, which is expected to be completed by 2032, would increase the capacity to 14 million passengers a year. Construction In September 2016, the government of Rwanda signed a binding agreement with Mota-Engil of Portugal to fund, build and operate the new airport for 25 years under concession from the government, with the contract renewable for an additional 15 years. Mota-Engil agreed to provide the $418 million to fund the first phase of construction. Commercial operations were expected to begin in 2018. In August 2017, construction began. The projected cost is now US$828 million. Mota-Engil, through its subsidiary Mota-Engil Africa is the main contractor and is providing 75 percent of the funding. The Rwandan company called Aviation Travel and Logistics (ATL), is providing the remaining 25 percent of the funding. ATL will also provide ground handling services at the airport. Completion of the first phase is expected in 2019. Construction on some parts of the airport was halted temporarily to pave way for a redesign. Under the new arrangements with Qatar Airways, a much larger airport is planned, with a construction budget of US$1.31 billion. The first phase is planned to take five years, with completion of the second phase planned in 2032.  Planned facilities  According to the TPS report, the new airport would be able to handle one million passengers and 150 million tonnes of cargo annually during its first phase. Bugesera International Airport will have a 30,000 square metre passenger terminal with 22 check-in counters, ten gates, and six passenger boarding bridges. It will also have provisions for a second runway.

Eldridge House is a historic building located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa, United States. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984.  Duncan Campbell Eldridge Duncan Campbell Eldridge (also known as D.C. Eldridge) was one of the original settlers in the city of Davenport. In December 1836 he opened a store in a log house on the corner of Front Street (now River Drive) and Ripley Street. He was said to be the first person in the town to keep a general assortment of goods. Antoine LeClaire, who was named the towns first postmaster, named Eldridge his deputy. Eldridge was a Whig politically and served as postmaster during the administrations of Presidents John Tyler and Zachary Taylor. The legislature of the Territory of Iowa incorporated the town in the winter of 1838-1839. The first election of officers was held on April 1, 1839, and Eldridge was elected one of the trustees. On July 25 of the same year seventeen people met in Eldridge's house to organize the Christian Church, also known as the Disciples of Christ. Architecture The Greek Revival style was the first style to have a significant impact in Davenport. The home was believed to have been built by another early Davenport settler Ambrose Fulton in 1865. It is somewhat unusual from other examples of this style in Davenport. with It is five bays rather than the typical three and its bank construction. From the north, the structure appears to be a small cottage, but its south façade reveals it to be a full two-story house. The north dormer and the porches on the north and south sides are believed to have been added 10 to 20 years after the house was built. The porch on the north side is a small, single bay structure while the porch on the south side is two stories and covers the full length of the structure.

They have toured with the likes of Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Black Veil Brides & Madina Lake and have also played at Download Festival, T in the Park and Sonisphere. History =Early years (2006–2009)= The band was founded by school friends: Andrew McShane (bassist) and Paul Charles Travers (guitarist) in Greenock, near Glasgow. The band named themselves Yashin as guitarist Paul Travers got nicknamed Yashin at school after the famous Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin. Original vocalist, Michael Rice joined the band as he had similar tastes in music to Andrew and they met whilst studying at University. The search for a drummer was a success when David Beaton arrived on the scene, Andrew chatted to David at one of the TBreak gigs at King Tut's, where both musicians played with their respective bands. But when the vacancy for the Yashin drummer became available Andrew hunted David down. Once David had cemented his place in Yashin, he then in turn introduced the band to ex-school friend and guitarist Lewis Millen and Yashin was born. Yashin quickly built up a following (Thanks to fellow Scottish band Flood of Red who took Yashin on the road). Yashin then released two EPs in 2008 Pay to Play and Miles Away But Getting Closer. Original vocalist Michael Rice announced his decision to leave the band in October 2008. During this transitional period Yashin had booked a tour-swap with Swedish band Her Bright Skies and for the UK leg of the tour Deaf Havana frontmen: James Veck-Gilodi and Ryan Mellor came and fronted the band and raised the energy of the live shows. On the return leg of the tour in Sweden Jordan Spiers from Flood of Red came and filled in on vocals with the band to help Yashin out. After a brief audition process the band chose to replace Rice with two vocalists, American born clean vocalist, Harry Radford of Priesthill and Scottish screamer/ singer, Kevin Miles of East Kilbride, widely regarded as the soundest member of the band. The new line up embarked on a nine date UK tour in April 2009 supporting Madina Lake, The Audition and fellow friends Flood of Red. Yashin then continued to tour for most of the year in the UK and Europe before commencing recording their debut album Put Your Hands Where I Can See Them, with Romesh Dodangoda at Long Wave Studios in November 2009. The band played their biggest headline show (at the time) on 5 December 2009, by selling out The Garage in their home town of Glasgow. =Put Your Hands Where I Can See Them 2010 & 2011= Yashin released their début album Put Your Hands Where I Can See Them on 1 February 2010, which included a fan-favourite cover of \\"Everytime\\" by Britney Spears. In March 2010, the band headed out on a gruelling 38 date tour supporting Glamour of the Kill, where the sextet made new friends in the Yorkshire metallers. In December 2010 the band toured the UK supporting Emarosa, and on January 31, 2011, the band had the chance to open for A Day to Remember while playing the O2 Academy in Glasgow, as part of their European tour. In March 2011, the band toured the UK in support of The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, and Yashin headlined 3 of the biggest dates on the tour: Leeds, Newcastle and Glasgow of course (all, which sold out). 2011 Saw Yashin play 2nd Stage at Donington Download festival. They also played the Honour over Glory Stage at Slam Dunk festival along with Deaf Havana, We Are The Ocean and While She Sleeps. On 16-17 July 2011, the band then supported their childhood heroes Papa Roach on two shows in London's O2 Shepherds Bush Empire and Sheffield's O2 Academy, the US band's only two appearances in the UK for 2011. Yashin also went to mainland Europe with Papa Roach and played in Germany, Prague and Switzerland. The band then went on to support Korn in Glasgow's O2 Academy on 8 June 2011 and play the Download Festival on 12 June and Nova Rock Festival in Austria on 13 June. The band then supported Black Veil Brides during their UK and European tour in autumn, 2011, with My Passion, and the response on this tour for Yashin was notable. The band supported The Blackout on 16 December, for their first show in Liverpool of their 'Christmas Hope Tour'. =2012 & We Created A Monster= Amongst the Winter dates with BVB and the Blackout the band had been writing for their 2nd studio album and demo-ing tracks with Tantrum To Blind guitarist and producer Simon Janlov. On 27 February the band announced that their new single \\"New Year or New York\\" would be released as a digital download single on Monday 5 March and also a limited edition signed CD. They also announced a new version of their debut album Put Your Hands Where I Can See Them called \\"Put Your Hands Where I Can See Them Revolution\\" which includes songs from their second EP Miles Away But Getting Closer re-recorded with vocalists Harry and Kevin in the style they have been performing on stage for the last 3 years. To those who pre-ordered the new single a link is activated which allows them to view the new music video for \\"New Year or New York\\". The band embarked upon a tour in March 2012 known as 'The Last One Standing Tour' featuring support from Jody Has A Hitlist, With One Last Breath and Tantrum To Blind, this tour included selling out London's Underworld, a sellout Manchester Club Academy and Yashin stepped up to another bigger venue in Glasgow: the Arches, which was then the band's biggest headline show to date. 2012 also saw Yashin headline the Jägermeister stage at Donington Download festival, Support Limp Bizkit in London, Germany, The Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Yashin also played some more shows with Black Veil Brides across Europe including shows in Prague, The Netherlands and Poland. Yashin featured at Pukkelpop, Belgium's Premier music festival and Yashin also played at many more UK independent festivals in the summer of 2012: Guilfest, Merthyr Rocks, Butserfest and a Memorable set at Hit The Deck. Yashin released their 2nd Studio Album We Created A Monster on 25 June 2012. On 24 October the band announced Lewis had left the band. They brought in the undisputed soy champion of Britain, Connor Macleod as their new guitarist & in February 2013 he was endorsed by Alpro. Yashin performed on the main stage at Radstock Festival on 30 March 2013. Yashin also performed at Slam dunk festival in 2013 in London, Leeds, Wolverhampton and Dublin. Yashin were asked to return to headline the Saturday in Newcastle and Sunday in Liverpool at Radstock Festival 2014. The band headlined their own tour in the UK with support act I Divide after announcing their next album titled 'The Renegades'. =The Renegades 2016= Midway into 2016 Yashin released their final album the Renegades. =Disbandment= In the spring of 2016 Yashin announced that they were breaking up although no reason for this was given. They played two final shows one at the Garage in Glasgow and one at the Garage in London. During these final shows at the end of 2016 original vocalist Michael Rice joined the band on stage to perform some final songs. Members of the bands have moved on to other things with Harry starting his own band Call me Amour, whereas Connor moved on to join Scottish band Divides.

The typical use is to send information and signals to cause electrical power-using devices to be turned off during periods of high demand. In its early phases, the OpenADR research was initiated by Demand Response Research Center (DRRC) which is managed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The specification was released in April 2009.http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/04 By contrast, the related OpenHAN standard for home area networks was promoted by utilities themselves and is an attempt to reconcile various home control technologies including X10, Insteon, P1901 and HomePlug. An Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) outreach collaborative was eventually formed in October 2010Welcome to the Open ADR Collaborative and a related OpenADR Alliance \\"to accelerate the development, adoption and compliance of OpenADR standards throughout the energy industry\\"OpenADR Alliance and \\"provide common language\\"OpenADR Provides Common Language  Latest for smart meters. The effort sought publicity for its attempt to unify smart grid plans under a common standards umbrella to form a viable cleantech industry with a relatively level playing field.OpenADR Alliance Formed to Accelerate Industry Adoption of an Automated Demand Response Standard for Smart Grid  Business Wire As NIST and NERC were committed to the OpenADR approach all along and the National Broadband Plan (United States) required (in its \\"goal 6\\") open access to consumer power use data by ADR providers, there was probably little doubt of the standards influence.Competition Heating Up for the OpenADR Market: Cleantech News «  Overviewhttps://openadr.memberclicks.net/overview  Demand Response (DR) is a set of actions taken to reduce load when electric grid contingencies threaten supply-demand balance or market conditions occur that raise electricity costs. Automated demand response consists of fully automated signaling from a utility, ISO/RTO or other appropriate entity to provide automated connectivity to customer end-use control systems and strategies. OpenADR provides a foundation for interoperable information exchange to facilitate automated demand response. The OpenADR Alliance is composed of industry stakeholders that are interested in fostering and accelerating the development and adoption of OpenADR standards and compliance with those standards. This extends to de facto standards based on specifications published by LBNL in April 2009, as well as Smart Grid-related standards emerging from OASIS, UCA, NAESB (North American Energy Standards Board), and ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air‐Conditioning Engineers).  A Brief History of OpenADR  The California energy crisis of 2002 served as the impetus for the effort that ultimately led to the creation of version 1.0 of the OpenADR standard. The Demand Response Research Center , which is operated by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), created the standard with funding from the California Energy Commission's (www.energy.ca.gov) Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program. Shortly after 2002, the DRRC worked with the California IOUs (SCE, SDG&E; and PG&E;) to jointly develop this technology through pilots and actual program implementations. In 2009, OpenADR was included in the Smart Grid Interoperability Standards Framework, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) identified OpenADR as a key standard for Demand Response. Additional standards work was performed by the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP), which is being tasked by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to oversee standardization of the Smart Grid.https://www.nist.gov/smartgridhttp://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki‐sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/OpenADR/ The North American Energy Standards Boardhttp://www.naesb.org contributed to the effort by developing a set of requirements. In that same year, the OpenADR specification was released as an official California Energy Commission (CEC) document, and the DRRC donated version 1.0 of the OpenADR standard to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standardshttp://www.oasis‐open.org and the Utilities Communication Architecture (UCA) International Users Group.http://www.ucaiug.org The work to create version 2.0 of the OpenADR standard is being performed by OASIS through its Energy Interoperation (EI) Technical Committeehttp://www.oasis‐open.org/committees/energyinterop/ with assistance from the UCAIug OpenADR Taskforce. Once work is completed on OpenADR version 2.0, with its expanded and complete set of DR and DER signals, the standard will be submitted to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in Geneva, Switzerland for adoption worldwide. IEC is the world's leading organization for international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies.  How OpenADR Works  In the Open Automated Demand Response Communications Specification (Version 1.0), LBNL describes OpenADR as: The specification also describes the scope of the OpenADR standard: During a Demand Response event, the utility or ISO/RTO provides information to the DRAS about what has changed and on what schedule, such as start and stop times. A typical change would specify one or more of the following: *PRICE_ABSOLUTE – The price per kilowatt‐hour * *PRICE_RELATIVE – A change in the price per kilowatt‐hour * *PRICE_MULTIPLE – A multiple of a basic rate per kilowatt‐hour * *LOAD_AMOUNT – A fixed amount of load to shed or shift * *LOAD_PERCENTAGE – The percentage of load to shed or shift * Note that in the first three cases, it would be up to the customer to determine how best to participate in the OpenADR event. For example, commercial customers might be notified of a change in Time‐of‐Use pricing during a peak period, and the Energy Management System (EMS) might be programmed to temporarily offset building temperatures by several degrees and dim or turn‐off non‐essential lights. The last two cases normally shed load automatically based on an existing arrangement. If prices continue to climb higher the EMS may escalate the DR program by reducing or turning off rooftop air handlers during the same peak period. The standard also specifies considerable additional information that can be exchanged related to DR and DER events, including event name and identification, event status, operating mode, various enumerations (a fixed set of values characterizing the event), reliability and emergency signals, renewable generation status, market participation data (such as bids), test signals, and more.http://www.openadr.org/assets/docs/openadr_primer.pdf  Relationship with Other Standards  In development of OpenADR, the OASIS Energy Interoperation Technical Committee is working with both the OASIS Energy Market Information Exchange (EMIX) and the OASIS Web Services Calendar (WS‐Calendar) Technical Committees to coordinate development of the full set of standards needed to exchange pricing information using a common schedule across energy markets.http://www.oasis‐open.org/committees/emix and www.oasis‐open.org/committees/ws‐calendar OASIS EMIX and WS-Calendar EMIX defines a standard way to exchange pricing and other information among ISOs and utilities. Because the price of electricity varies with the time of delivery, EMIX conveys the necessary time and interval data using WS‐Calendar as a common clock. Both EMIX (Common Price Communication Model) and WS‐ Calendar (Common Scheduling Mechanism) take advantage of the SGIP Priority Action Plan (PAP) assessment and recognition process. OpenADR also interacts, although less directly, with the NAESB Energy Usage Information Model and the ASHRAE Facility Smart Grid Information Model. The Energy Usage Information Model supports load curtailment, load shaping and energy market operations, all of which pertain to Demand Response. The Facility Smart Grid Information Model will create a standardized data exchange that enables control systems in the customer premises to manage electrical loads and generation sources in response to communications from utilities, and other electrical service providers or market operators. OpenADR will also need to interoperate directly or interwork indirectly with other popular protocols now used for energy management, including BACnet, LonMarkhttp://www.lonmark.org and the Smart Energy Profile ZigBee. Depending on the protocol, this is expected to be accomplished either with enhancements to these standards, or with separate software or systems, such as a gateway function capable of translating between protocols.  Why The OpenADR Alliance Was Formed  The OpenADR Alliance was formed to build on the foundation of technical activities to support the development, testing, and deployment of commercial OpenADR and facilitates its acceleration and widespread adoption. This approach needs to engage service providers (such as electric utilities and systems operators) within the domain of the Smart Grid that publish OpenADR signals, as well as the facilities or third-party entities that consume them to manage electric loads. The OpenADR Alliance will enable all stakeholders to participate in automated DR, dynamic pricing, and electricity grid reliability. The OpenADR Alliance activities will include, but not be limited to, the following:https://openadr.memberclicks.net/overview * Develop a conformance, certification, and testing process/program for OpenADR, coordinated with entities such as standard development organizations (SDOs), user groups, and Smart Grid activities. * * Collaborate with SDOs and user groups for the continued enhancements of the OpenADR standard. * * Collaborate with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and other government agencies to expand the adoption of OpenADR. * * Collaborate with other alliances and organizations on global partnership opportunities. * * Develop an OpenADR marketing portal targeted to customers that may be interested in participating in an automated DR program. Members can use this portal to promote their offerings and direct interested parties to their own web sites for information. * * Conduct and provide education and training sessions for system integrators, control vendors, and others to enable them to install \\"OpenADR-ready\\" equipment within facilities to receive OpenADR signals; and customers to help them develop load management strategies. * * Establish centralized development and documentation related to OpenADR deployments, including lessons learned from previous deployments and the development of best practices. * * Develop programs to allow vendors to develop, test, and demonstrate their ability to integrate with OpenADR signals. *  The Role of the OpenADR Alliance  The mission of the OpenADR Alliance is to foster the development, adoption and compliance of the OpenADR standards through collaboration, education, training, testing and certification. The Alliance will also promote the worldwide market acceptance of the OpenADR standard. Work being performed by industry coalitions like the OpenADR Alliance is critical to the success of new Smart Grid standards. No new standard is ever 100% complete, and different interpretations can cause interoperability problems in early implementations. For this reason, the Alliance is supported by a broad cross section of utilities, independent system operators, regional transmission operators, regulators and vendors who share a common interest in the success and widespread adoption of the OpenADR standard. In performing its work, the Alliance will adhere to industry best practices as detailed in the Interoperability Process Reference Manual (IPRM) created by the SGIP Testing and Certification Committee (www.sgip.org). The IPRM outlines the conformance, interoperability and cyber‐security testing and certification requirements for Smart Grid standards recommended by the SGIP.

Originally a solo project created by ex-Harlem Shakes' guitarist Todd Goldstein, ARMS has since evolved into a four-piece band, with the inclusion of drummer Tlacael Esparza, bassist Matty Fasano and keyboardist Dave Harrington. Goldstein handles guitar and vocal duties.  History  Goldstein originally started ARMS as a musical outlet for himself when he first moved to Brooklyn. When he joined Harlem Shakes in 2006, ARMS became his side-project, put on the back burner so he could focus on guitar and songwriting duties for his new band. However, he continued to write and record ARMS music in his bedroom during the band's downtime, handling all instrumentation duties himself. Over the course of three years, these single microphone and laptop recording sessions ultimately became ARMS' full-length debut, Kids Aflame. After its release, with Goldstein going into the studio with his bandmates to work on what would become Harlem Shakes' full-length debut and the promotional tour that followed the release of that record, there was little opportunity to promote Kids Aflame. But, despite the lack of promotion, the record still garnered a fair amount of positive attention from critics. It was featured on Paste's list of Eight Criminally Underrated Albums From 2009 and praised for \\"perfectly encapsulating the daunting search for identity and authenticity.\\" When Harlem Shakes broke up in the summer of 2009, Goldstein shifted his focus back to his side-project, recruited a band of musicians and, for the first time, ARMS became a collaborative endeavor. This new incarnation of ARMS began writing music together immediately and, in March 2010, released their first EP (aptly titled 'EP') free in digital format online. One of the tracks from the EP, Heat & Hot Water, was remixed by Electropop group, Passion Pit. ARMS has also opened for Passion Pit in addition to The Walkmen, Japandroids, and White Rabbits. Members of the band performed with LCD Soundsystem at their final concert at Madison Square Garden on April 2, 2011. The band's full-length studio album, 'Summer Skills', is scheduled for release in November 2011. Goldstein was also one-half of the now seemingly defunct folk duo, The Sea & The Gulls, which he formed with his friend, Leah Beeferman. Together, they released one album, Things That Fly.

They are one of the most popular and widely cultivated groups of flowering plants, especially in temperate climates. Numerous cultivars have been produced, especially over the last two centuries, though roses have been known in the garden for millennia beforehand. While most garden roses are grown for their flowers, some are also valued for other reasons, such as having ornamental fruit, providing ground cover, or for hedging. History It is believed that roses were grown in many the early civilisations of temperate latitudes from at least 5000 years ago. They are known to have been grown in ancient Babylon. Paintings of roses have been discovered in Egyptian pyramid tombs from the 14th century BC. Records exist of them being grown in Chinese gardens and Greek gardens from at least 500 BC. Many of the original plant breeders used roses as a starting material as it is a quick way to obtain results. Most of the plants grown in these early gardens are likely to have been species collected from the wild. However, there were large numbers of selected varieties being grown from early times; for instance numerous selections or cultivars of the China rose were in cultivation in China in the first millennium AD. The significant breeding of modern times started slowly in Europe, from about the 17th century. This was encouraged by the introduction of new species, and especially by the introduction of the China rose into Europe in the 19th century. An enormous range of roses has been bred since then. A major contributor in the early 19th century was Empress Josephine of France who patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England. Features An amber-coloured rose Roses are one of the most popular garden shrubs in the world with both indoor and outdoor appeal. They possess a number of general features that cause growers and gardeners to choose roses for their gardens. This includes the wide range of colours they are available in; the generally large size of flower, larger than most flowers in temperate regions; the variety of size and shape; the wide variety of species and cultivars that freely hybridize. =Colour of flowers= Rose flowers have historically been cultivated in a diverse number of colours ranging in intensity and hue; they are also available in countless combinations of colours which result in multicoloured flowers. Breeders have been able to widen this range through all the options available with the range of pigments in the species. This gives us yellow, orange, pink, red, white and many combinations of these colours. However, they lack the blue pigment that would give a true purple or blue colour and until the 21st century all true blue flowers were created using some form of dye. Now, through genetic modification, a Japanese company succeeded in creating a blue rose in 2004. Colours are bred through plant breeding programs which have existed for a long time. Roses are often bred for new and intriguing colour combinations which can fetch premium prices in market. Classification There is no single system of classification for garden roses. In general, however, roses are placed in one of three main groups: Wild, Old Garden, and Modern Garden roses. The latter two groups are usually subdivided further according to hybrid lineage, although due to the complex ancestry of most rose hybrids, such distinctions can be imprecise. Growth habit and floral form are also used as means of classification. This is the most common method to classify roses as it reflects their growth habits. =Wild roses= The spring-flowering pimpinellifolia 'Rosa Altaica', underplanted with lamium Wild roses, also denominated \\"species roses\\", include the natural species and some of their immediate hybrid descendants. The wild roses commonly grown in gardens include Rosa moschata (\\"musk rose\\"), Rosa banksiae (\\"Lady Banks' rose\\"), Rosa pimpinellifolia (\\"Scots rose\\" or \\"burnet rose\\"), Rosa rubiginosa (\\"sweetbriar\\" or \\"eglantine\\"), and Rosa foetida in varieties 'Austrian Copper', 'Persian Double', and 'Harison's Yellow'. For most of these, the plants found in cultivation are often selected clones that are propagated vegetatively.Readers Digest Encyclopaedia of Garden Plants and Flowers. 2nd ed., London, 1978. Wild roses are low-maintenance shrubs in comparison to other garden roses, and they usually tolerate poor soil and some shade. They generally have only one flush of blooms per year, described as being \\"non-remontant\\", unlike remontant, modern roses. Some species have colorful hips in autumn, e. g. Rosa moyesii, or have colourful autumnal foliage, e. g. Rosa virginiana. =Old garden roses= An old garden rose is defined as any rose belonging to a class which existed before the introduction of the first modern rose, La France, in 1867.Note that the definition applies to the class, not the specific cultivar; Bourbon and Tea etc. roses introduced in the 21st century are still \\"Old\\" Garden Roses Alternative terms for this group include heritage and historic roses. In general, Old Garden roses of European or Mediterranean origin are once-blooming woody shrubs, with notably fragrant, double-flowered blooms primarily in shades of white, pink and crimson-red. The shrubs' foliage tends to be highly disease-resistant, and they generally bloom only from canes (stems) which formed in previous years. The introduction of China and Tea roses (see below) from East Asia around 1800 led to new classes of Old Garden Roses which bloom on new growth, often repeatedly from spring to fall. Most Old Garden Roses are classified into one of the following groups. Alba 'Maiden's Blush', an Alba rose (before 1400) Literally \\"white roses\\", derived from R. arvensis and the closely allied R. × alba. The latter species is a hybrid of R. gallica and R. canina. This group contains some of the oldest garden roses. The shrubs flower once yearly in the spring or early summer with scented blossoms of white or pale pink. They frequently have gray- green foliage and a vigorous or climbing habit of growth. Examples are 'Alba Semiplena', 'White Rose of York'. Gallica Gallica rose 'Charles de Mills', ante 1790 The Gallica, Gallica Hybrid, or Rose of Provins group is a very old class developed from Rosa gallica, which is a native of central and southern Europe and western Asia. The \\"Apothecary's Rose\\", R. gallica varietas officinalis, was grown in the Middle Ages in monastic herbaria for its alleged medicinal properties, and became famous in English history as the Red Rose of Lancaster. Gallicas are shrubs that rarely grow over 4 feet (1.25 m) tall and flower once in Summer. Unlike most other once-blooming Old Garden Roses, gallicas include cultivars with flowers in hues of red, maroon, and purplish crimson. Examples include 'Cardinal de Richelieu', 'Charles de Mills', and 'Rosa Mundi' (R. gallica varietas versicolor). Damask 'Autumn Damask' ('Quatre Saisons') Named for Damascus, Damask roses (Rosa × damascena) originated in ancient times with a natural hybrid (Rosa moschata × Rosa gallica) × Rosa fedtschenkoana. Robert de Brie is given credit for bringing damask roses from the Middle East to Europe sometime between 1254 and 1276, although there is evidence from ancient Roman frescoes that at least one damask rose existed in Europe for hundreds of years before this. Summer damasks bloom once in summer. Autumn or Four Seasons damasks bloom again later, albeit less exuberantly, and these were the first remontant (repeat- flowering) Old European roses. Damask roses tend to have rangy to sprawling growth habits and strongly scented blooms. Examples: 'Ispahan', 'Madame Hardy'. Centifolia or Provence Centifolia roses are also known as Cabbage roses, or as Provence roses. They are derived from Rosa × centifolia, a hybrid that appeared in the 17th century in the Netherlands, related to damask roses. They are named for their \\"one hundred\\" petals; they are often called \\"cabbage\\" roses due to the globular shape of the flowers. The centifolias are all once-flowering. As a class, they are notable for their inclination to produce mutations of various sizes and forms, including moss roses and some of the first miniature roses (see below). Examples: 'Centifolia', 'Paul Ricault'. Moss The Moss roses are based on one or more mutations, particularly one that appeared early on Rosa × centifolia, the Provence or cabbage rose. Some with Damask roses as a parent may be derived from a separate mutation. Thickly growing or branched resin-bearing hairs, particularly on the sepals, are considered to resemble moss and give off a pleasant woods or balsam scent when rubbed. Moss roses are cherished for this trait, but as a group they have not contributed to the development of new rose classifications. Various hybrids with other roses have yielded different forms, such as the modern miniature creeping moss rose 'Red Moss Rambler' (Ralph S. Moore, 1990). Moss roses with centifolia background are once- flowering; some moss roses exhibit repeat-blooming, indicative of Autumn Damask parentage. Examples: 'Common Moss' (centifolia-moss), 'Mousseline', also known as 'Alfred de Dalmas' (Autumn Damask moss). Portland The Portland roses were long thought to be the first group of crosses between China roses and European roses, and to show the influence of Rosa chinensis. Recent DNA analysis however has demonstrated that the original Portland Rose has no Chinese ancestry, but has an autumn damask/gallica lineage.Rosarosam.com This group of roses was named after the Duchess of Portland who received (from Italy about 1775) a rose then known as R. paestana or 'Scarlet Four Seasons' Rose' (now known simply as 'The Portland Rose'). The whole class of Portland roses was developed from that one rose. The first repeat-flowering class of rose with fancy European-style blossoms, the plants tend to be fairly short and shrubby, with a suckering habit, with proportionately short flower stalks. The main flowering is in the summer, but intermittent flowers continue into the autumn. Examples: 'James Veitch', 'Rose de Rescht', 'Comte de Chambord'. China 'Parson's Pink China' or 'Old Blush,' one of the \\"stud Chinas\\" The China roses, based on Rosa chinensis, have been cultivated in East Asia for centuries. They have been cultivated in Western Europe since the late 18th century. They contribute much to the parentage of today's hybrid roses, and they brought a change to the form of the flowers then cultivated in Europe. Compared with the older rose classes known in Europe, the Chinese roses had less fragrant, smaller blooms carried over twiggier, more cold-sensitive shrubs. However they could bloom repeatedly throughout the summer and into late autumn, unlike their European counterparts. The flowers of China roses were also notable for their tendency to \\"suntan,\\" or darken over time unlike other blooms which tended to fade after opening. This made them highly desirable for hybridisation purposes in the early 19th century. According to Graham Stuart Thomas, China roses are the class upon which modern roses are built. Today's exhibition rose owes its form to the China genes, and the China roses also brought slender buds which unfurl when opening. Tradition holds that four \\"stud China\\" roses—'Slater's Crimson China' (1792), 'Parsons' Pink China' (1793), and the Tea roses 'Hume's Blush Tea-scented China' (1809) and 'Parks' Yellow Tea-scented China' (1824)—were brought to Europe in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; in fact there were rather more, at least five Chinas not counting the Teas having been imported. This brought about the creation of the first classes of repeat- flowering Old Garden Roses, and later the Modern Garden Roses. Examples: 'Old Blush China', 'Mutabilis' (Butterfly Rose), 'Cramoisi Superieur'. Tea Tea rose 'Mrs Dudley Cross' (Paul 1907) The original Tea-scented Chinas (Rosa × odorata) were Oriental cultivars thought to represent hybrids of R. chinensis with R. gigantea, a large Asian climbing rose with pale-yellow blossoms. Immediately upon their introduction in the early 19th-century breeders went to work with them, especially in France, crossing them first with China roses and then with Bourbons and Noisettes. The Tea roses are repeat-flowering roses, named for their fragrance being reminiscent of Chinese black tea (although this is not always the case). The colour range includes pastel shades of white, pink and (a novelty at the time) yellow to apricot. The individual flowers of many cultivars are semi-pendent and nodding, due to weak flower stalks. In a \\"typical\\" Tea, pointed buds produce high-centred blooms which unfurl in a spiral fashion, and the petals tend to roll back at the edges, producing a petal with a pointed tip; the Teas are thus the originators of today's \\"classic\\" florists' rose form. According to rose historian Brent Dickerson, the Tea classification owes as much to marketing as to botany; 19th-century nurserymen would label their Asian-based cultivars as \\"Teas\\" if they possessed the desirable Tea flower form, and \\"Chinas\\" if they did not. Like the Chinas, the Teas are not hardy in colder climates. Examples: 'Lady Hillingdon', 'Maman Cochet', 'Duchesse de Brabant', 'Mrs. Foley Hobbs'. Bourbons Bourbon rose Rosa 'Souvenir de la Malmaison' (Béluze 1843) Bourbon roses originated on the Île Bourbon (now called Réunion) off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. They are believed to be the result of a cross between the Autumn Damask and the 'Old Blush' China rose, both of which were frequently used as hedging materials on the island. They flower repeatedly on vigorous, frequently semi-climbing shrubs with glossy foliage and purple-tinted canes. They were first Introduced in France in 1820 by Henri Antoine Jacques. Examples: 'Louise Odier', 'Mme. Pierre Oger', 'Zéphirine Drouhin' (the last example is often classified under climbing roses). Noisette Noisette rose 'Desprez à fleurs jaunes' (Desprez 1830) The first Noisette rose was raised as a hybrid seedling by a South Carolina rice planter named John Champneys. Its parents were the China rose 'Parson's Pink' and the autumn-flowering musk rose (Rosa moschata), resulting in a vigorous climbing rose producing huge clusters of small pink flowers from spring to fall. Champneys sent seedlings of his rose (called 'Champneys' Pink Cluster') to his gardening friend, Philippe Noisette, who in turn sent plants to his brother Louis in Paris, who then introduced 'Blush Noisette' in 1817. The first Noisettes were small-blossomed, fairly winter-hardy climbers, but later infusions of Tea rose genes created a Tea-Noisette subclass with larger flowers, smaller clusters, and considerably reduced winter hardiness. Examples: 'Blush Noisette', 'Lamarque' (Noisette); 'Mme. Alfred Carriere', 'Marechal Niel' (Tea-Noisette). (See French and German articles on Noisette roses) Hybrid perpetual Hybrid perpetual rose 'La Reine' (Laffay 1844) The dominant class of roses in Victorian England, hybrid perpetuals, their name being a misleading translation of \\"hybrides remontants\\" (\\"reblooming hybrids\\"), emerged in 1838 as the first roses which successfully combined Asian remontancy (repeat blooming) with the old European lineages. Because remontancy is a recessive trait, the first generation of Asian and European crosses, i. e., hybrid Chinas, hybrid bourbons, and hybrid noisettes, were stubbornly non-remontant, but when these roses were re-crossed with themselves or with Chinas or teas, some of their offspring flowered more than once. The hybrid perpetuals thus were something of a miscellaneous, catch-all class derived to a great extent from the bourbons but with admixtures of Chinas, teas, damasks, gallicas, and to a lesser extent noisettes, albas, and even centifolias. They became the most popular garden and florist roses of northern Europe at the time, as the tender tea roses would not thrive in cold climates, and the hybrid perpetuals' very large blooms were well suited to the new phenomenon of competitive exhibitions. The \\"perpetual\\" in the name suggests their remontancy, but many varieties of this class only poorly exhibited the property; the tendency was for a massive vernal bloom followed by either scattered summer flowering, a smaller autumnal burst, or sometimes no re- flowering in that year. Due to a limited colour palette of white, pink, and red, and a lack of reliable remontancy, the hybrid perpetuals were finally overshadowed by their descendants, the hybrid teas. Examples include 'Général Jacqueminot', 'Ferdinand Pichard', 'Paul Neyron', and 'Reine des Violettes'. Hybrid musk Hybrid musk rose 'Moonlight' (Pemberton 1913) Although they arose too late to qualify technically as old garden roses, the hybrid musks are often informally classed with them, since their growth habits and care are much more like the old garden roses than modern roses. The hybrid musk group was mainly developed by Rev. Joseph Pemberton, a British rosarian, in the first decades of the 20th century, based upon 'Aglaia', an 1896 cross by Peter Lambert. A seedling of this rose, 'Trier', is considered to the foundation of the class. The genetics of the class are somewhat obscure, as some of the parents are unknown. Rosa multiflora, however, is known to be one parent, and Rosa moschata (the musk rose) also figures in its heritage, though it is considered to be less important than the name would suggest. Hybrid musks are disease-resistant, repeat flowering and generally cluster-flowered, with a strong, characteristic \\"musk\\" scent. The stems tend to be lax and arching, with limited thorns. Examples include 'Buff Beauty' and 'Penelope'. Hybrid rugosa Rugosa rose 'Blanc Double de Coubert' (Cochet 1893) The hybrid rugosas likewise are not officially old garden roses, but tend to be included in them. Derived from Rosa rugosa (\\"Japanese rose\\"), native to Japan and Korea and introduced into the West circa the 1880s, these vigorous roses are extremely hardy with excellent disease resistance. Most are extremely fragrant, remontant, and produce moderately double, flat flowers. The defining characteristic of a hybrid rugosa rose is its rugose, i. e., wrinkly foliage, but some hybrid rugosas lack this trait. These roses often set large hips. Examples include 'Hansa' and 'Roseraie de l'Häy'. Bermuda \\"Mystery\\" roses This is a group of several dozen \\"found\\" roses grown in Bermuda for at least a century. The roses have significant value and interest for those growing roses in tropical and semi-tropical regions, since they are highly resistant to both nematode damage and the fungal diseases that plague rose culture in hot, humid areas. Most of these roses are thought to be Old Garden Rose cultivars that have otherwise dropped out of cultivation, or sports thereof. They are \\"mystery roses\\" because their \\"proper\\" historical names have been lost. Tradition dictates that they are named after the owner of the garden where they were rediscovered. Miscellaneous There are also a few smaller classes (such as Scots, Sweet Brier) and some climbing classes of old roses (including Ayrshire, Climbing China, Laevigata, Sempervirens, Boursault, Climbing Tea, and Climbing Bourbon). Those classes with both climbing and shrub forms are often grouped together. =Modern garden roses= Classification of modern roses can be quite confusing because many modern roses have old garden roses in their ancestry and their form varies so much. The classifications tend to be by growth and flowering characteristics. The following includes the most notable and popular classifications of Modern Garden Roses: Hybrid tea A 'Memoriam' hybrid tea rose (von Abrams 1962) The favourite rose for much of the history of modern roses, hybrid teas were initially created by hybridising hybrid perpetuals with Tea roses in the late 19th century. 'La France', created in 1867, is universally acknowledged as the first indication of a new class of roses. Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway between both parents: hardier than the teas but less hardy than the hybrid perpetuals, and more ever-blooming than the hybrid perpetuals but less so than the teas. The flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, and each flowering stem typically terminates in a single shapely bloom. The shrubs tend to be stiffly upright and sparsely foliaged, which today is often seen as a liability because it makes them more difficult to place in the garden or landscape. Hybrid teas became the single most popular garden rose of the 20th century; today, their reputation as high maintenance plants has led to a decline in popularity. The hybrid tea remains the standard rose of the floral industry, however, and is still favoured in formal situations. Examples: 'Peace' (yellow), 'Garden Party' (white), 'Mister Lincoln' (red) and 'Double Delight' (bi-colour cream and red). Pernetiana Pernetiana rose 'Soleil d'Or', the first of its class (Pernet 1900) The French breeder Joseph Pernet-Ducher initiated the first class of roses to include genes from the old Austrian briar rose (Rosa foetida) with his 1900 introduction of 'Soleil d'Or.' This resulted in an entirely new colour range for roses: shades of deep yellow, apricot, copper, orange, true scarlet, yellow bicolours, lavender, gray, and even brown were now possible. Originally considered a separate class, the Pernetianas or Hybrid Foetidas were officially merged into the Hybrid Teas in 1930. The new colour range did much to increase hybrid tea popularity in the 20th century, but these colours came at a price: Rosa foetida also passed on a tendency toward disease-susceptibility, scentless blooms, and an intolerance of pruning to its descendants. Polyantha The name of this class literally means \\"many-flowered\\", from the Greek \\"poly\\" (\\"many\\") and \\"anthos\\" (\\"flower\\"). Originally derived from crosses between two East Asian species, Rosa chinensis and Rosa multiflora, polyanthas first appeared in France in the late 19th century alongside the hybrid teas. They are short plants, some compact and others spreading in habit, producing tiny blooms (2.5 cm or 1 inch in diameter on average) in large sprays in the typical rose colours of white, pink, and red. Their popularity derived from their prolific blooming: from spring to autumn; a healthy polyantha shrub truly might be covered in flowers, making a strong colour impact in the landscape. Polyantha roses are still popular and regarded as low-maintenance, disease-resistant, garden roses. The class of roses denominated \\"Multiflora Hybrids\\" are probably cognizable as polyanthas. Examples include Rosa 'Cécile Brünner', 'The Fairy', 'Pink Fairy', and 'Red Fairy'. Floribunda Rosa 'Borussia', a modern floribunda rose Some rose breeders recognized potential in crossing polyanthas with hybrid teas, to create roses that bloomed with the profusion of polyanthas and possessed the floral beauty and breadth of coloration of hybrid teas. In 1907, the Danish breeder Dines Poulsen introduced the first cross of a polyantha and hybrid tea, denominated 'Rödhätte'.Phillips, R. and Rix, M., The Ultimate Guide to Roses, Macmillan, 2004, p. 226. This hybrid had some characteristics of both of its parental classes, and was denominated a \\"Hybrid Polyantha\\" or \\"Poulsen\\" rose. Further and similar introductions followed from Poulsen, these often bearing the family name, e. g., 'Else Poulsen' (1924). Because their hybrid characteristics separated them from polyanthas and hybrid teas, the new class eventually was named Floribunda, Latin for \\"many-flowering\\". Typical floribundas are stiff shrubs that are smaller and bushier than the average hybrid tea, but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The flowers are often smaller than those of hybrid teas but are produced in large sprays that give a better floral effect in the garden. Floribundas are found in all hybrid tea colours and often with the classic, hybrid tea-shaped blossom. Sometimes they differ from hybrid teas only in their cluster flowered habit. They are still planted in large bedding schemes in public parks and suitable gardens. Examples include 'Anne Harkness', 'Dainty Maid', 'Iceberg', and 'Tuscan Sun'. Grandiflora Grandifloras, Latin for \\"large- flowered\\", are the class of roses created in the middle of the 20th century as back crosses of hybrid teas and floribundas that fit neither category, specifically, Rosa 'Queen Elizabeth', which was introduced in 1954. Grandiflora roses are shrubs that are typically larger than both hybrid teas and floribundas and produce flowers that resemble those of hybrid teas and are borne in small clusters of three to five, similar to floribundas. Grandifloras were somewhat popular from circa 1954 into the 1980s, but today they are much less popular than both hybrid teas and floribundas. Examples include: 'Comanche,' 'Montezuma', and 'Queen Elizabeth'. Miniature 'Meillandine' (a miniature rose) in a terracotta flowerpot Dwarf mutations of some Old Garden Roses—gallicas and centifolias—were known in Europe in the 17th century, although these were once-flowering just as their larger forms were. Miniature forms of repeat-flowering China roses were also grown and bred in China, and are depicted in 18th-century Chinese art. Modern miniature roses largely derive from such miniature China roses, especially the cultivar 'Roulettii', a chance discovery found in a pot in Switzerland. Miniature roses are generally twiggy, repeat-flowering shrubs ranging from 6\\" to 36\\" in height, with most falling in the 12\\"–24\\" height range. Blooms come in all the hybrid tea colors; many varieties also emulate the classic high-centered hybrid tea flower shape. Owing to their small stature, they make excellent plants for containers, hanging baskets and window boxes. Miniature roses are often marketed and sold by the floral industry as houseplants, but they grow poorly in the dry air and reduced light of average home and office conditions, and are best reserved for outdoor gardening. (Examples: 'Petite de Hollande' (Miniature Centifolia, once-blooming), 'Cupcake' (Modern Miniature, repeat- blooming). Additional examples: Scentsational, Tropical Twist. Miniature garden roses only grow in the summer. Climbing and rambling Rosa 'Zéphirine Drouhin', a climbing Bourbon rose (Bizot 1868) The \\"Peggy Martin Rose\\" survived 20 feet of salt water over the garden of Mrs. Peggy Martin, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina. It's a thornless climbing rose. All aforementioned classes of roses, both Old and Modern, have \\"climbing/arching\\" forms, whereby the canes of the shrubs grow to be much longer and more flexible than the normal \\"bush\\" forms. In the Old Garden Roses, this is often simply the natural growth habit; for many Modern Roses, however, climbing roses are the results of spontaneous mutations. For example, 'Climbing Peace' is designated as a \\"Climbing Hybrid Tea,\\" for it is genetically identical to the normal \\"shrub\\" form of the 'Peace' hybrid tea rose, except that its canes are long and flexible, i. e. \\"climbing.\\" Most Climbing Roses grow 6–20 feet tall and exhibit repeat blooming. \\"Rambler Roses\\", although technically a separate class, are often included in Climbing Roses. They also exhibit long, flexible canes, but are usually distinguished from true climbers in two ways: a larger overall size (20–30 feet tall is common) and of a once-blooming habit. Climbing and Rambling Roses are not true vines such as ivy, clematis, and wisteria because they lack the ability to cling to supports on their own and must be manually trained and tied over structures, such as arbors and pergolas. Examples include 'American Pillar' (once-blooming rambler), and 'Blaze' (repeat-blooming climber). One of the most vigorous of the Climbing Roses is the Kiftsgate Rose, Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate', named after the house garden where Graham Stuart Thomas noticed it in 1951. The original plant is claimed to be the largest rose in the United Kingdom, and has climbed 50 feet high into a copper beech tree. Shrub The shrub rose 'Mollineux' This is not a precisely defined class of garden rose, but it is a description or grouping commonly used by rose reference books and catalogues. It encompasses some old single and repeat flowering cultivars, as well as modern roses that don't fit neatly into other categories. Many cultivars placed in other categories are simultaneously placed in this one. Roses classed as shrubs tend to be robust and of informal habit, making them recommended for use in a mixed shrub border or as hedging. English / David Austin 'Abraham Darby' (1985) Although not officially recognized as a separate class of roses by any established rose authority, English (aka David Austin) roses are often set aside as such by consumers and retailers alike. Development started in the 1960s by David Austin of Shropshire, England, who wanted to rekindle interest in Old Garden Roses by hybridizing them with modern hybrid teas and floribundas. The idea was to create a new group of shrub roses that featured blooms with old- fashioned shapes and fragrances, evocative of classic Gallica, Alba and Damask roses, but with modern repeat-blooming characteristics and the modern expanded color range as well. Austin mostly succeeded in his mission; his tribe of \\"English\\" roses, now numbering hundreds of varieties, has been warmly embraced by the gardening public and are widely available to consumers. English roses are still actively developed, with new varieties released annually. The winter hardiness and disease resistance of the classic Old Garden roses has largely been compromised in the process; many English roses are susceptible to the same disease problems that plague modern hybrid teas and floribundas, and many are not hardy north of USDA Zone 5. Examples: 'Charles Austin', 'Graham Thomas', 'Mary Rose', 'Tamora', 'Wife of Bath'. Canadian Hardy Rosa 'Henry Hudson', one of the Explorer series Bugnet 1950) Two main lines of roses were developed for the extreme weather conditions of Canadian winters by Agriculture Canada at the Morden Research Station in Morden, Manitoba and the Experimental Farm in Ottawa (and later at L'Assomption, Québec). They are called the Explorer series and the Parkland series. These programs were transferred to the Canadian Nursery Landscape Association (CNLA) and Vineland Research and Innovation Centre in 2010.https://www.newswire.ca/news- releases/signature-rose-series-and-ornamental-breeding-program-transferred-to- industry-545533182.html. New varieties have been launched as Vineland's 49th Parallel Collection http://49throses.com/and include Canadian Shield(R), Chinook Sunrise(R), Aurora Borealis(TM), and Yukon Sun(TM). More hardy roses are expected to be added to this collection in the coming years. Derived mostly from crosses of Rosa rugosa or the native Canadian species Rosa arkansana with other species, these plants are extremely tolerant of cold weather, some down to −35C. All have repeat bloom. A wide diversity of forms and colours were achieved. Examples of roses in the Explorer series are: 'Martin Frobisher', 'Jens Munk' (1974), 'Henry Hudson' (1976), 'John Cabot' (1978), 'David Thompson' (1979), 'John Franklin' (1980), 'Champlain' (1982), 'Charles Albanel' (1982), 'William Baffin' (1983), 'Henry Kelsey' (1984), 'Alexander Mackenzie' (1985), 'John Davis' (1986), 'J.P. Connell' (1987), 'Captain Samuel Holland' (1992), 'Frontenac' (1992), 'Louis Jolliet' (1992), 'Simon Fraser' (1992), 'George Vancouver' (1994), 'William Booth' (1999). Roses in the Parkland series include 'Morden Centennial', 'Morden Sunrise, 'Winnipeg Parks' and 'Cuthbert Grant'. Two roses named after Canadian artists that have been added are 'Emily Carr' and 'Felix Leclerc'. Other notable Canadian breeders include Frank Skinner, Percy Wright, Isabella Preston, Georges Bugnet and Robert Erskine. Landscape (Ground Cover) 'Avon', a ground cover rose introduced by Poulson in 1992 This type of rose was developed mainly for mass amenity planting. In the late 20th century, traditional hybrid tea and floribunda rose varieties fell out of favour with many gardeners and landscapers, as they are often labour and chemical intensive plants susceptible to pest and disease problems. So-called \\"landscape\\" roses (also known as \\"ground cover\\" roses) have thus been developed to fill the consumer desire for a garden rose that offers colour, form and fragrance, but is also low maintenance and easy to care for. Most have the following characteristics: * Lower growing habit, usually under * Repeat flowering * Disease and pest resistance * Growing on their own roots. * Minimal pruning requirements Principal parties involved in the breeding of new varieties include: Werner Noak (Germany), Meidiland Roses (France), Boot & Co. (Netherlands), and William Radler (US). Patio Chris Warner's patio climber 'Open Arms' (1995) Since the 1970s many rose breeders have focused on developing compact roses (typically 1'–4' in height and spread) that are suitable for smaller gardens, terraces and containers. These combine characteristics of larger miniature roses and smaller floribundas—resulting in the rather loose classification \\"patio roses\\", called Minifloras in North America. D. G. Hessayon says the description \\"patio roses\\" emerged after 1996. Some rose catalogues include older polyanthas that have stood the test of time (e.g., 'Nathalie Nypels', 'Baby Faurax') within their patio selection. Rose breeders, notably Chris Warner in the UK and the Danish firm of Poulson (under the name of Courtyard Climbers) have also created patio climbers, small rambler style plants that flower top-to-toe and are suitable for confined areas. It is suggested patio style roses are protected during winter months due to the exposure environment. Cultivation freezing In the garden, roses are grown as bushes, shrubs or climbers. \\"Bushes\\" are usually comparatively low growing, often quite upright in habit, with multiple stems emerging near ground level; they are often grown formally in beds with other roses. \\"Shrubs\\" are usually larger and have a more informal or arching habit, and may additionally be placed in a mixed border or grown separately as specimens. Certain bush hybrids (and smaller shrubs) may also be grown as \\"standards\\", which are plants grafted high (typically 1 metre or more) on a rose rootstock, resulting in extra height which can make a dominant feature in a floral display. Climbing roses are usually trained to a suitable support. Roses are commonly propagated by grafting onto a rootstock, which provides sturdiness and vigour, or (especially with Old Garden Roses) they may be propagated from hardwood cuttings and allowed to develop their own roots. Most roses thrive in temperate climates. Those based on warm climate Asian species do well in their native sub-tropical environments. Certain species and cultivars can even flourish in tropical climates, especially when grafted onto appropriate rootstocks. Most garden roses prefer rich soil which is well- watered but well-drained, and perform best in well-lit positions which receive several hours of sun a day (although some climbers, some species and most Hybrid Musks will tolerate shade). Standard roses require staking. =Pruning= Rose pruning, sometimes regarded as a horticultural art form, is largely dependent on the type of rose to be pruned, the reason for pruning, and the time of year it is at the time of the desired pruning. Most Old Garden Roses of strict European heritage (albas, damasks, gallicas, etc.) are shrubs that bloom once yearly, in late spring or early summer, on two-year-old (or older) canes. Their pruning requirements are quite minimal because removal of branches will remove next year's flower buds. Hence pruning is usually restricted to just removing weak and spent branches, plus light trimming (if necessary) to reduce overall size. Modern hybrids, including the hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, modern miniatures, and English roses, have a complex genetic background that almost always includes China roses (which are descended from Rosa chinensis). China roses were evergrowing, everblooming roses from humid subtropical regions that bloomed constantly on any new vegetative growth produced during the growing season. Their modern hybrid descendants exhibit similar habits; unlike Old European Roses, modern hybrids bloom continuously (until stopped by frost) on any new canes produced during the growing season. They therefore require pruning back of any spent flowering stem in order to divert the plant's energy into producing new growth and hence new flowers. Additionally, modern hybrids planted in cold winter climates will almost universally require a \\"hard\\" annual pruning (reducing all canes to 8\\"–12\\", about 30 cm in height) in early spring. Again, because of their complex China rose background, modern hybrids are typically not as cold hardy as European Old Garden Roses, and low winter temperatures often desiccate or kill exposed canes. In spring, if left unpruned, these damaged canes will often die back all the way to the shrub's root zone, resulting in a weakened, disfigured plant. The annual \\"hard\\" pruning of hybrid teas and floribundas is generally done in early spring. =Deadheading= This is the practice of removing any spent, faded, withered, or discoloured flowers. The purpose is to encourage the plant to focus its energy and resources on forming new shoots and blooms, rather than fruit production. Deadheading may also be performed for aesthetic purposes, if spent flowers are unsightly. Any roses such as Rosa glauca or Rosa moyesii that are grown for their decorative hips should not be deadheaded. =Pests and diseases= Roses are subject to several diseases. The main fungal diseases affecting the leaves are rose black spot (Diplocarpon rosae), rose rust (Phragmidium mucronatum), rose powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca pannosa) and rose downy mildew (Peronospora sparsa). Stems can be affected by several canker diseases, the most commonly seen of which is stem canker (Leptosphaeria coniothyrium). Diseases of the root zone include honey fungus (Armillaria spp.), verticillium wilt, and various species of phytophthora. Fungal leaf diseases affect some cultivars and species more than others. On susceptible plants fungicidal sprays may be necessary to prevent infection or reduce severity of attacks. Cultivation techniques may also be used, such as ensuring good air circulation around a plant. Stem cankers are best treated by pruning out infection as soon as it is noticed. Root diseases are not usually possible to treat once infection has occurred; the most practical line of defence is to ensure that growing conditions maximise plant health and thereby prevent infection. Phytophthora species are waterborne and therefore improving drainage and reducing waterlogging can help reduce infection. The main pest affecting roses is the aphid (greenfly), which sucks the sap and weakens the plant. In areas where they are endemic Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica) take a heavy toll on rose flowers and foliage; rose blooms can also be destroyed by infestations of thrips (Thysanoptera spp). Roses are also used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on roses. Spraying with insecticide of roses is often recommended but if this is done care is needed to minimize the loss of beneficial insects; systemic insecticides have the advantage of only affecting insects which feed on the plants. Notable rose growers Some rose growers are known for their particular contributions to the field. These include: * David Austin nursery, based in Shropshire, UK, is the developer of \\"English roses\\", such as 'Constance Spry', 'Mary Rose' and 'Graham Thomas' *Peter Beales was a specialist in classic and species roses, preserving many old and wild roses at his Norfolk nursery and also introducing 70 new cultivars. He was also the author of several classic books on the subject of roses. * Joséphine de Beauharnais (Empress Josephine) was the first great collector of roses in the modern Western world, and her horticulturalist André Dupont pioneered the development of new hybrids using controlled pollination at her Malmaison estate. She has been called the godmother of modern rosomaniacs.Brenner, Douglas, and Scanniello, Stephen (2009). A Rose by Any Name. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Algonquin Books. * Cants of Colchester, in Essex, is the UK's oldest firm of commercial rose growers. Notable introductions include 'Mrs B.R. Cant' and 'Just Joey'. * Conard-Pyle Co. introduced the rose 'Peace' to the US and established the marque Star Roses. 'Peace' was bred by Meilland of France (where it was introduced as 'Mme A. Meilland'); Conard-Pyle acted as Meilland's US agents, and the rose was renamed for the US market when it was introduced at the end of the Second World War. * Georges Delbard of Allier, France is more famous for new varieties of fruit tree, but among his nursery's roses are 'Centenaire de Lourdes', 'Altissimo' and 'Papa Delbard'. * Dickson Roses, located near Belfast introduced its first roses in 1886, focusing on breeding Hybrid Teas that could stand up to the Irish climate. Successes include 'Shot Silk' and 'Grandpa Dickson' and, more recently, 'Elina' and 'Tequila Sunrise'. * Pedro Dot put Spanish rose growing on the map and is best known for the shrub 'Nevada' and his work to improve the flower shape of miniature varieties. * Claude Ducher was a Lyon hybridiser and nurseryman (father-in-law of Joseph Pernet-Ducher), whose roses include the Noisette 'Reve d'Or' and the Tea rose 'Marie van Houtte'. * Andre Dupont was a French horticulturalist who pioneered the creation of new rose cultivars through controlled pollination. He was employed by the Empress Josephine to use her collection of roses to create new roses. * Rudolf Geschwind was an Austro-Hungarian amateur rose breeder who introduced around 140 new varieties, including 'Gruss an Teplitz'. He focused on winter hardiness and vigour. * Jules Gravereaux, founder of Roseraie de L'Haÿ * Harkness Roses, in Hertfordshire, UK is best known for 'Ena Harkness' (at one time reputed to be the best-selling red Hybrid Tea in the world and actually bred by amateur rosarian Albert Norman). Other famous introductions include 'Compassion' and 'Margaret Merril'. * S. Reynolds Hole was Dean of Rochester Cathedral in the UK and the founder of the (Royal) National Rose Society. He organized the first specialty rose show in the UK and published books on rose cultivation, popularizing rose growing and exhibiting. * Jackson & Perkins is a hugely influential American rose grower. The company's early success was 'Dorothy Perkins', but under Eugene Boerner the focus on developing Floribundas led to many All-America Rose Selection honours. * W. Kordes' Sons, based in Sparrieshoop in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, is one of the most innovative rose breeders and growers, and responsible for the early flowering \\"Frühlings\\" series, the Kordesii Hybrids and many famous Hybrid Tea and Floribunda roses, including 'Crimson Glory' and 'Iceberg' ('Schneewittchen'). * McGredy, of Northern Ireland, was responsible for 'Evelyn Fison', 'Dublin Bay' and also 'Regensberg', a pioneering 'handpainted' rose. Sam McGredy IV moved to New Zealand in 1974 and focused on hybrid teas and Grandifloras, including 'Paddy Stephens' and 'Kathryn McGredy'. * Meilland family made its name and fortune with 'Mme A. Meilland' ('Peace'), and has continued to be at the forefront of rose breeding, with varieties such as 'Bonica '82' and 'Swany'. * Ralph S. Moore, the California-based breeder of more than 500 roses, is known as 'the father of Modern Miniatures' and was a hugely influential figure in the development of commercial approaches to rose hybridization. * Werner Noack of Germany introduced the Flower Carpet (ground cover/landscape) series. * Paul's was a Hertfordshire nursery that involved two brothers (William and George) and their two sons (Arthur William and Paul Laing). Paul's is known today for varieties such as 'Paul's Lemon Pillar' and 'Paul's Scarlet Climber'. Experimental hybrids using species roses resulted in choice varieties such as 'Mermaid'. * Joseph Pemberton was an Anglican clergyman and amateur rosarian who set out to breed 'old fashioned' roses. The resulting hybrid musks include 'Felicia' and 'Penelope'. On his death, the nursery passed to his gardener J.A. Bentall, who produced 'Buff Beauty' and the Polyantha 'The Fairy'. * Jean Pernet, père was a Lyon nurseryman whose notable roses include the Moss variety 'Louis Gimard' and the hybrid perpetual 'Baronne Adolphe de Rothschild'. * Joseph Pernet-Ducher was among the first rose breeders to focus on developing the new Hybrid Tea class. His introductions include 'Mme Caroline Testout' and 'Soleil d'Or'- forerunner of 20th-century yellow and orange roses. * Poulson, the Danish rose dynasty, was established in 1878 and originally focused on breeding roses hardy enough to withstand the Scandinavian climate. Later introductions notable for their form and colour include 'Chinatown' (1963) and 'Ingrid Bergman' (1984). The nursery developed a number of successful ground cover (landscape) roses, including 'Kent' (1988). * Rose Barni in Tuscany specialises in roses for Mediterranean climates. Notable successes include 'Castore' and 'Polluce', and striped varieties such as 'Rinascimento' and 'Missoni'. * Mathias Tantau * Graham Stuart Thomas is best known for reawakening interest in old garden roses, but also ensured commercial introductions in the wild rose style, including 'Bobbie James' and 'Souvenir de St Anne's'. * Dr. Walter van Fleet worked for the US Department of Agriculture, focusing on crops, but also developing roses designed to thrive in the American climate. His introductions include 'American Pillar' and 'Dr W. Van Fleet'. After his death, his seedlings - including 'Mary Wallace', 'Breeze Hill' and 'Glenn Dale' - were introduced by the American Rose Society as 'dooryard climbers'. * Jean-Pierre Vibert was a prolific early rose hybridizer, responsible for many older roses still found in gardens today. 'Aimee Vibert' (1828), one of his Noisettes, was named for his daughter. * Weeks Roses (with Tom Carruth:fr:Tom Carruth, Retrieved 2011-12-16) is a California rose company that has focused on innovations in colour, form and vigour. Its roses include 'Night Time', 'Stainless Steel', 'Fourth of July' and 'Hot Cocoa'.

Through his daughter he was the grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine, successively queen of France and England. Family Aimery was born to Boson II de Châtellerault and his wife, Aleanor de Thouars. His paternal grandparents were Hugues I de Châtellerault and his wife, Gerberge. His maternal grandparents were Aimery IV, Viscount of Thouars and Aremgarde de Mauléon. Life =Marriage= Aimery was married to Amauberge, called Dangereuse, the daughter of Bartholomew de l'Isle Bouchard and his wife Gerberge de Blaison. Their marriage produced at least three children: * Hugh, succeeded his father as Viscount of Châtellerault; * Raoul, who became the lord of Fay-la-Vineuse through his marriage to Elisabeth de Faye; * Aenor ( – March 1130), who married William X, Duke of Aquitaine. She was the mother of Duchess Eleanor, Petronilla, and William Aigret, who died at the age of four. Eleanor became Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right, as well as twice being a queen, through successive marriages to Louis VII of France and Henry II of England. Eleanor of Aquitaine was known to have been quite fond of her maternal uncles, Hugh and Raoul, and granted them during her two tenures as queen of France and then of England. =The Affair= In 1115, after seven years of marriage, Amauberge was \\"abducted\\" from her bedchamber by William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. She was taken to a tower in his castle in Poitiers called Maubergeonne. As a result, Amauberge or Dangereuse was nicknamed La Maubergeonne. Abductions like these were quite common among nobles during the Middle Ages. However, in this particular case she seems to have been a willing contributor to the affair. The Duke of Aquitaine, the earliest known troubadour whose work survives, was quite popular with the women of his time and was known to have had many affairs. However, the Viscountess would become his mistress for the rest of his life. There is no record of complaint by Aimery. This is believed to be because the Viscount feared the wrath of his powerful and volatile overlord. It would be the Duke's wife, Philippa of Toulouse who took action against the \\"abduction\\" and affair. Her actions would lead to both William and Dangereuse being excommunicated by the Pope. William used his wealth and power to eventually reconcile with the Pope and was accepted back into the Church. In 1121 Aimery and Dangereuse's daughter, Aenor, married William IX's son and heir, who would become Duke William X of Aquitaine. It is believed that this union came about at Dangereuse's urging. Historians don't see another reason for the union of such a powerful man to the daughter of a minor vassal. Not only that, but Aenor was the daughter of the woman the future duke hated for her role in the treatment of his mother. Despite the cause, the marriage led to the birth of Eleanor of Aquitaine and made Aimery an ancestor of some of Europe's most famous nobles and rulers.

History  = 2004 unrest in Kosovo = During the unrests in March 2004 that occurred throughout Kosovo, 12000 Kosovo Albanian rioters tried to storm the Serb-populated areas of Čaglavica. Norwegian and Swedish peacekeepers from KFOR created a blockade by using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades, in order to keep the two groups apart. A truck was driven by a Kosovo Albanian at full speed towards the barricade in an attempt to penetrate the line. After firing warning shots at the truck, the Norwegians had to use deadly force to avoid friendly casualties, and shot the driver. 16 Norwegian peacekeepers were injured, and 13 of them had to be evacuated. Another KFOR unit consisting of mostly Swedish soldiers also participated in defending Čaglavica that day, supported by people from the barracks who normally worked with non-military tasks. Lieutenant Colonel Hans Håkansson, who commanded 700 people during the unrest, reported that the fighting went on for 11 hours, and that many collapsed due to dehydration and broken limbs while struggling to fend off waves of rioters. In total, 35 people were injured while defending the town. Hans Håkansson was awarded with a medal for his actions by the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 2005.

It is a mound covering the site of graves, in the form of a cairn, located in Gloucestershire. It lies to the west of the village of Rodmarton, south of the road between Cherington and Tarlton. There are trees growing on the site. Description It is approximately wide and long, and is oriented from east to west. The construction consists of approximately 5,000 tons of stone, under a mound. The only portion of the stones that can still be seen is a fake entrance, which lies at the eastern side of the mound. The site is managed by Gloucestershire County Council, under the guardianship of English Heritage. Excavations Digging took place in 1863, and again in 1939, after which the mound was restored. The site contains two tombs, behind the false entrance, with passageways to the north and south. The tombs contained the remains of ten adults and three children. Animal remains were also uncovered, including boar tusks, horses teeth and calf jawbones. Two tombstones, were unearthed in the first dig, and these are approximately in height, and a third and larger stone was leaning against them, seemingly placed in that position. It was noted at the time that this specific arrangement was similar to cromlech mounds in Kilkenny, Ireland, and in Cornwall. The third stone may have been placed in this manner for use in sacrifices. Evidence of structured walls to support the cairn were also discovered. with a double-thickness wall surrounding the entire structure, and further walls providing strength in a transverse direction. Etymology There is no evidence that a windmill ever existed in the location; instead, one possible etymology derives from the word Nant from Nantoush, meaning \\"The diffuser of fire or light\\", and the English word win which has similar meaning.

Meteorological history Windstorm Carmen formed as a low-pressure system off the east coast of the United States. By 9 November, while over Nova Scotia, the system was named \\"Carmen\\" as it passed into the North Atlantic near and over southern Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, which had been suffering from the lesser windstorm Becky since the 5th. Becky died out over Denmark and Northern Germany on the 12th, and its remnants joined windstorm Carmen over Russia on the 14th. Due to a strong pressure gradient, gale-force winds were recorded in the United Kingdom. A wind gust was recorded at Capel Curig, Wales. Traveling eastward, Carmen eventually attained a central pressure of 949 millibars as it struck the United Kingdom. At 06:00 UTC on Friday, 12 November 2010, Carmen was over the North Sea, east of Scotland, with a central pressure of approximately . Carmen was last noted over western Russia on 14 November 2010, as it continued to weaken, and had burnt itself out over the Former Yugoslavia, Eastern Europe, Moscow, and the Gulf of Finland between 18 and 19 November 2010. Impact =8 November= High winds and rough seas battered the western coastline of Ireland on the nights of 7-8 November 2010. Heavy sleet and rain fell across the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, coastal Lancashire, Cumbria, and coastal Wales on the 8 November. Minor spot floods hit part of the Salthill promenade in Galway, with traffic diverted through the Salthill village as Assistant Commissioner John Twomey warned of strong winds and debris making driving conditions difficult in Ireland. Ireland The storm grew in intensity, and a heavy band of rain hit Western Ireland on the morning of 8 November 2010, then Wales and Wessex between 04:00 and 07:00 UTC. By 09:00 UTC, the rain had reached most of England, Wales, and western Scotland. Minor flooding was reported in Oxfordshire over Radio Oxford, and the Channel Islands and Normandy's Cotentin peninsula were also hit. The heaviest rainfall was over patches of southwest Ireland, Pembrokeshire, Bristol, Dumfriesshire, Morecambe Bay, Carlisle, central Lancashire, Sussex, Surrey, parts of the English Channel, and Cherbourg. A crash in County Galway killed two people due to weather-related road conditions. Another fatal nighttime road accident occurred on the Mountmellick to Emo road at Knightstown, Mountmellick, in which a male cyclist was fatally injured after being hit by a car. A Brazilian man from the English Midlands drowned in a car accident that morning on the Offaly–Westmeath border. His car skidded off the road between Rhode and Rochfortbridge, hit a roadside bank, and rolled on its roof into the flood- swollen water of the River Monagh on the 8th. The water levels at Galway Docks and the Claddagh Basin rose violently in the evening as extensive sand-bagging was put in place at the Spanish Arch, Quay Street and Flood Street for the short term. County Cork was hit by minor flooding, and the owners of Penrose Quay feared heavy tidal flooding of the quay as wind and waves sloshed against it menacingly at evening high tide. Gardaí Assistant Commissioner Twomey said in a press interview: \\"Sadly, so far this year over 190 people were killed on the national roads. 35 people were killed during October, making it one of the worst months for fatalities since February 2008\\". He went on to warn of the hazards caused by decreasing seasonal daylight and a greater chance of encountering wet and slippery road surfaces. In County Galway a van and a bus carrying 27 students from Mayo to Limerick skidded on groundwater and crashed at Glenafosha outside Tuam just after 7:30 pm, killing both drivers and injuring 12 of the students. Northern Ireland High winds, driving rain, and occasional snow hit Northern Ireland. Ice, floods and fallen trees affected most roads. Gale-force winds ripped through Downpatrick and County Londonderry overnight. The Foyle Bridge in the city of Derry was closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds. The Glenshane Pass was cleared of snow and gritted, but there were 22 incidents of flooding on roads overnight. Roads throughout the country were closed due to fallen trees and flooding. England and France In England a major HSE rail investigation was launched after a morning commuter train skidded along Charing Cross to Hastings line on wet leaves. The train from Charing Cross sped through one station at ; the terrified driver immediately contacted signal control center to raise the alarm as his train skidded down the track for , after he braked when approaching Stonegate railway station in East Sussex. At midday the Met office issued a severe weather alert for the whole UK as Britain was battered by , with snow in the north of England and up to of rain across the east Midlands, south and south east. There were gusts of at Berry Head in Devon and in Dundrennan, Dumfries and Galloway. High winds and waves battered Whitley Bay in North Tyneside and gale-force winds hit parts of London, Penbrokeshire and the Pennines. Weather overnight caused much chaos in the UK, and periodic gale-force northerly winds hit most the UK at some time during the night. The worst-affected areas were the northwest and southeast tips of England. On the evening of the 8th, 28-year-old kitesurfer Adrien Monnoyeur from Toulouse ignored safety warnings and was killed as a gale in the Saint Jean de Luz resort, near Biarritz in southwest France, dragged him at across the beach and fatally slammed him down from in the air onto the beach, after hitting the Grand Hotel and a local pier en route. Winds on the 8 November had top speeds of 65 mph (105 km/h). A weather warning was issued for parts of south-east and south-west England, due to up to 70mm of predicted rain overnight. Fourteen flood warnings were in place for Wales, the English Midlands and North East England, and a severe weather warning for parts of south Wales. Scotland The Northlink ferry MV Hjaltland was due to dock in Aberdeen, but was diverted to Rosyth as Aberdeen harbour was closed for 18 hours over the 8th and 9th. Snow was a problem in the Highlands and on high roads such as the A9 at Drumochter in the Scottish Highlands and on the M74 north of Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway. Heavy rain replaced earlier snow in Aberdeen, Braemar and Dumfries and Galloway. Snow fell continuously at the Cairngorm Mountain resort and the A93 Glenshee to Braemar road was closed because of drifting snow and high winds as blizzards were reported around Dumfries. The storm had mostly ended in Ireland, Wales and Wessex by 20:00, but had intensified over Northern Ireland and Ayrshire. It remained in several scattered, but heavy bands across the British Isles, with only County Antrim, Perthshire, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Durhamshire, Cumbria, Lancashire, Norfolk, Berkshire, southern Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex being badly affected from through the night. =9 November = On the 9th, 9 flood warnings and 33 flood watches were still in effect in the UK. Heavy thunderstorms continued in some areas but mostly died out through the afternoon. Snow was a bigger problem, occurring in the English Midlands and Scotland. Vehicles had to be rescued in Cumbria and Wessex, with many road closures. Train, ferry and some air services were also affected by high winds. =10–11 November= This image shows the number of fatalities in the British Isles caused by storms from November 8th to December 31st. See file page for map key. A new band of heavy rain moved eastward over the UK and Ireland on the 10th. This second storm complex moved rapidly overnight on the 10th and 11th, with thunderstorms and torrential rain being reported near Bristol, parts of central Ireland and from central Scotland to the English North Midlands. It reached Belgium and left Ireland, Wessex, and Wales by 10:00 on the 11th. The only gale-force winds in the second system were in coastal areas, with heavy rainfall causing limited flooding.-://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_gspXONLCY Donegal was worst hit in Ireland, with isolated flooding occurring throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Irish Farmers Association reported that the River Shannon burst its banks in numerous places. Several roads were blocked by fallen trees across the island, causing disruption to road travel. =12–13 November=  UK and Ireland  The heaviest rainfall recorded on the weekend of 12 November was 29 mm in 12 hours in Shap, Cumbria, while Lancashire and Yorkshire saw 7–10 mm in the same period. The Isle of Wight, which had suffered flooding earlier in the week, was flooded again due to heavy rains with 100 homes affected. At Aberdaron in Gwynedd, Wales, a 36 m/s (130 km/h) wind gust was reported on 12 November. Downed trees and unsafe structures were also a problem in Wales in the aftermath of earlier storms. Widespread rainfall and some heavy winds occurred throughout the afternoon. Winds were strongest in coastal and elevated locations, with gusts generally in the range of 27–31 m/s (97–113 km/h) and up to in some areas or even 160 km/h (100 mph) according to some reports. In one case, a falling tree struck and killed a motorist in Yorkshire. Another woman died in Pinderfield's Hospital after being impaled by a tree branch during winds of up to 90 mph in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Some had to evacuate their homes in this period, and aircraft had to be diverted from Leeds Bradford International Airport when gusts reached 100 mph. Flights and ferry crossings to the Isle of Man were also cancelled. A wind speed of was recorded on Great Dun Fell in the Pennines. The worst-hit places in this period were the Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Northern Ireland, North West England, Yorkshire and the Humber. Blackpool Tower suffered structural damage and surrounding roads were closed. A paving slab hit a fairground ride in Bridlington, causing £30,000 worth of damage. Approximately 5,000 people were left without electricity in Northern Ireland. Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands On November 12, many Belgian rivers and canals rose above the national alarm level, with some of their defenses failing. Four deaths occurred over the weekend in Belgium. A third weather band drifted up from off the coast of Brittany and hit southwest Ireland, Cornwall and Normandy's Cotinian Peninsula at 07:00 on the 12th, moving inland. Gusts of 62 mph hit the coast of northwest England that morning. A heavily loaded fishing boat capsized in the Baltic Sea, but the captain, who was alone, was safely rescued. Beyond some flooding and snowfall, the original storm had mainly dissipated by Friday evening. In continental Europe, high winds caused the Karneval festivities in Cologne and elsewhere in the Rhineland to be cut short. The St. Martin's Day procession was cancelled in Aachen and minor flooding and high winds occurred in various parts of Germany, but no one was injured. Two people died in southern Belgium, according to Dutch and RTBF. A man was washed away in a street and a 72-year- old woman was killed in her car. Both fatalities occurred during the night of the 13 November, in the community of Solre-Saint-Géry, part of Beaumont, near the French border. By the afternoon another body was found in nearby Lessines. Firefighters worked desperately to patch up polders, dykes, and river defences in Germany. Road and rail traffic were disrupted, but quickly restored. Emergency teams reinforced dams, dykes, bridges and canal/river banks, relieving the firefighters. Belgian weather experts and state authorities described the flooding in that country as the worst in 50 years. The national weather service said Belgium had as much rainfall in two days (13th and 14th) as it normally gets in a month. Belgium was badly flooded and Liège was cut off on the 14th. The flood defences failed in places. The River Dendre flooded Brussels heavily, reaching 46 cm above alarm level along with several canals on 14 November. 200 houses were evacuated. The Meuse basin also rose 2 metres above the mean level. Floods and heavy rainfall also began in the Netherlands on the 14th. Heavy rains flooded out the centre of the seaside town of Granville in northern France after 2 inches of rain fell on the region within 24 hours, according to Radio France Internationale. At least one death occurred in Granville during the storm. =15–16 November= Further flooding and mudslides occurred in Belgium on the 15th. One person was swept away by the floods as she tried to cross a bridge in the south. Army rescue teams helped with emergency evacuations, including a hospital, as many of Belgian's roads were blocked or flooded. Several Belgian regions put disaster emergency plans into operation as a canal burst its banks in several places near Brussels leading to more than 200 houses being evacuated and a pharmaceutical factory closed down due to local flooding. Though the weather had improved, flooding remained a problem in Belgium. A staggering 80 litres per square metre were recorded in a few locations. Despite the 4 deaths and heavy material losses involved, the Belgian government refused to take any responsibility for the state's lack of preparedness for flooding. Both the heavily flooded southern Netherlands and wind-ravaged Luxembourg had no deaths at all in the same period. In the Netherlands, the River Maas broke its banks, causing flooding in several towns. In Limburg, even hilly regions were affected. In the east of Noord Brabant province, the local water board deliberately flooded fields the size of 50 football pitches to keep the river from rupturing its crumbling embankments. At the town of Baarlo, three rivers rose from 2 to 50 meters at their junction and ran through the town on the 15th. Luxembourg was affected by the same weather complex, but received little, if any damage. Similar scenes occurred in the north of Par. Rain pours down at Oxford station on Nov 16th. =17 November= A new band of rain and thunderstorms hit the UK and Ireland on the 17th. Parts of France and the coast of Portugal experienced heavy storms on that day as well, as did the Bay of Biscay and Iceland. On the 17th, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to send aid to Cornwall, still experiencing heavy rains and gale-force winds. Luxulyan, Both police and Ben Johnston, flood risk manager for the Environment Agency, declared the flooding a \\"major incident\\" with hundreds of residents evacuated. Schools were closed and the transport network was hugely disrupted with interruption of train services and motorists urged not to drive in Cornwall. By mid afternoon the rain had lessened and police and military worked together with a helicopter to rescue people from their cars and houses in Cornwall. A heavy mudslide near Lostwithiel cut off local roads and water completely surrounded the village of Mevagissey, which was evacuated. Pentewan residents dubbed a £1,300,000 flood relief scheme approved by the Environment Agency \\"money down the drain.\\" In Belgium, the rivers Nete, Demer, and Ijzer had risen to danger level. Storms continued over parts of Europe into the evening. =18–21 November= Belgium continued to experience heavy rains, and both Belgium and Cornwall continued to be on flood alert. Prince Charles visited the Cornish villages of St Austell, Lostwithiel and St Blazey between the 19th and the 21st, pledging financial aid for the people of Cornwall. Prime Minister Cameron visited Lostwithial and St Blazey on the 19th, denying that he had misled Parliament when he said flood protection money had been safeguarded in the spending review. He also denied having alluded to plans to reform flood relief financing. Storms moved to Scandinavia, most of Eastern Europe, some parts of Central Europe, the Balkans, Kiev, Moscow and Morocco by the 19th. Though the weather had cleared in the UK, heavy storms continued to hit the western coast of Ireland, Dublin, and Northern Ireland on the night of the 18th and morning of the 19th. Flooding and traffic disruption continued in Northern Ireland through the 19th, with main roads flooded out. Becky and Carmen died off in northwest Russia by the 20th. Aftermath The floods came at a politically delicate time for the UK as its coalition government reneged on a long-held pledge to protect flood defences from government imposed spending cuts. This included a £100,000,000 plan to protect Leeds, though the £14,250,000 Banbury flood prevention scheme would continue.The November 11th edition of the Banbury Guardian Total relief funds were cut from £335,000,000 a year to £261,000,000 for the next 4 years despite climate change Secretary Chris Huhne saying that extreme weather would become more common over time. There were also plans to build permanent flood defences in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire at an estimated cost of £4,500,000. In Ireland, on the other hand, flooding policies helped reduce storm-related damage. Several businesses in Lostwithiel were badly damaged by the mudslide there. Mud ruined several £3,000 ball gowns in a clothes shop, and a bakery was destroyed. The repairs and flood defences were estimated to cost millions of pounds and take about a year to complete. European insurers agreed on 25 October that they needed to hold up to 37,000,000 euros ($51,480,000) of extra capital under new fiscal solvency rules to cover potential losses from windstorm damage in Europe, in the light of events such as Windstorm Emma, according to loss and exposure aggregator PERILS. Windstorms are expected to increase in air pressure and strength over Europe and the Americas over the next 5–10 years. The Eurowind probabilistic risk assessment model that quantifies the prospective risk from windstorms in Europe and is part of WORLDCATenterpriseTM , EQECAT's catastrophe-event-modelling software platform, and would be used to calculate future prospective windstorm and flooding losses. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and CloudSat satellite would be used to assess the extent of any future storms as they first emerge in the atmosphere. The insurance company AXA sponsored a three-year-long €275 million catastrophe bond from 2 November 2, 2010 to cover European windstorm risks in the event of a disaster like Windstorm Emma earlier that decade. The nations covered by the bond scheme are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Axa closed its upsized €275,000,000 catastrophe bond on 2 November to cover itself against potential losses from European windstorms, after upsizing the insurance bond twice in 2010 to meet heavy investor demand. The Irish firm Calypso Capital will be used to cover against potential windstorm insurance claims in its nine Western European member countries between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. The building has been repurposed as commercial and office space called One River Place. History Because the Civil War cut off cotton supplies from the southern states, wool increased in popularity in the North. To take advantage of the situation Joseph Shields established Shields Woolen Mills in 1863. By 1870 he employed 52 people and the annual production value of the mill was $36,000, which made it the sixth largest industry in Davenport. Several fires and financial problems caused Shield's problems and he committed suicide in 1878. By 1881 the business was reorganized as the Davenport Woolen Mills. In the 1890s the mill employed 140 people and its product line included clothing, cashmere, flannels, and blankets. It would be the high point of the company, however. As the sheep herds moved further west the production of woolen goods moved with them. The company's financial situation rose and fell and it finally closed in 1914. Architecture This two-story industrial building has both shallow side gable and flat roofs. It is constructed in brick with a stone foundation and basement, which is exposed on the south elevation of the building. Segmental arch windows predominate throughout the structure. The middle section with the pedimented entrance is the original section of the building that was completed in 1863. Additions were made to the structure with the last one added in 1868.

Rheumatoid lung disease is characterized by pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis, lung nodules and pulmonary hypertension. Common symptoms associated with the disease include shortness of breath, cough, chest pain and fever. It is estimated that about one quarter of people with rheumatoid arthritis develop this disease, which are more likely to develop among elderly men with a history of smoking. Rheumatoid lung is separate from but often associated with Interstitial lung disease(ILD). Signs and symptoms Most common: *Chest Pain *Cough *Fever *Shortness of breath *Joint pain, stiffness, swelling *Skin nodules People may not present with all these symptoms or non at all. From most to lest common: *Pleural involvement (pleurisy, effusions) *Pulmonary parenchymal nodules, more common in men than in women *Rheumatoid-associated interstitial lung disease *Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia *Obliterative bronchiolitis (obstructive lung disease/bronchiectasis) *Rheumatoid-associated pulmonary hypertension *Pulmonary vasculitis/arteritis *Shrinking lung syndrome *Miscellaneous: MTX, cricoarytenoid arthritis, infection, cancer  Causes  The exact cause of rheumatoid lung disease is unknown. However, associated factors could be due largely to smoking. Sometimes, the medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, especially methotrexate, may result in lung disease. Prevention's: * Stop smoking: Chemicals found in cigarettes can irritate already delicate lung tissue, leading to further complications. * Having regular checkups: The doctor could listen to lungs and monitor breathing, because lung problems that are detected early can be easier to treat.  Mechanism  RA is a complex and poorly understood disease. However, the characteristic presence of antibodies to citrullinated proteins (anti-CCP) suggests that there are pathogenic mechanisms unique to RA. Recent studies suggest a link between smoking, HLA- DRBSE, anti-CCP and RA. Smoking has long been linked to RA and worsens articular disease as well as rheumatoid lung disease. Exposure to cigarette smoke leads to the activation of PADI enzymes that deaminate arginine to citrulline, producing autoantigens like citrullinated collagen and fibrinogen. Autoantigenic peptides containing citrulline residues are preferentially bound by HLA-DRB SE proteins and are presented to T cells, which interact with CCP- specific B cells found at sites containing autoantigen and produce inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies, which accelerate disease. Bacterial or viral infections of the respiratory tract may also exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and rheumatoid lung disease.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of RA was formerly based on detection of rheumatoid factor (RF). However, RF is also associated with other autoimmune diseases. The detection of anti-CCP is currently considered the most specific marker of RA. The diagnosis of rheumatoid lung disease is based on evaluation of pulmonary function, radiology, serology and lung biopsy. High resolution CT scans are preferred to chest X-rays due to their sensitivity and specificity. Associated doctors to diagnosis this properly would be a Rheumatologists or Pulmonologist. Within a physical examination doctors could find possible indications, such as hearing crackles (rales) when listening to the lungs with a stethoscope. Or, there may be decreased breath sounds, wheezing, a rubbing sound, or normal breath sounds. When listening to the heart, there may be abnormal heart sounds. Bronchoscopic, video-assisted, or open lung biopsy allows the histological characterization of pulmonary lesions, which can distinguish rheumatoid lung disease from other interstitial lung diseases. The following tests may also show signs of rheumatoid lung disease: * Chest x-ray may show:  pleural effusion  lower zone predominant reticular or reticulonodular pattern  volume loss in advanced disease  skeletal changes, e.g. erosion of clavicles, glenohumeral erosive arthropathy, superior rib notching * Chest CT or HRCT features include:  pleural thickening or effusion  interstitial fibrosis  bronchiectasis  bronchiolitis obliterans  large rheumatoid nodules * single or multiple * tend to be based peripherally * may cavitate (necrobiotic lung nodules) * cavitation of a peripheral nodule can lead to pneumothorax or haemopneumothorax.  follicular bronchiolitis * small centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud * rare  Caplan syndrome * Echocardiogram (may show pulmonary hypertension) * Lung biopsy (bronchoscopic, video-assisted, or open), which may show pulmonary lesions * Lung function tests * Needle inserted into the fluid around the lung (thoracentesis) * Blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis  Treatment  Many people with this condition have no symptoms. Treatment is aimed at the health problems causing the lung problem and the complications caused by the disorder. Fast-acting drugs for RA include aspirin and corticosteroids, which alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Slow-acting drugs termed disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), include gold, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), which promote disease remission and prevent progressive joint destruction. In patients with less severe RA, pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs and physical rest are sufficient to improve quality of life. In patients with joint deformity, surgery is the only alternative for recovering articular function. Prognosis is related to the underlying disorder and the type and severity of lung disease. In severe cases, lung transplantation can be considered. This is more common in cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary fibrosis, or pulmonary hypertension. Most complications are not fatal, but does reduce life expectancy to an estimated 5 to 10 years.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of RA is around 0.3–1.2% (0.92% of Americans). Women are 2–3 times more susceptible than men. The prevalence of rheumatoid lung disease in patients with RA depends on the method used for diagnosis: chest X rays (5%), high resolution CT scans (10–40%). A study showed 582 patients with RA and 603 subjects without RA were followed for a mean of 16.4 and 19.3 years, respectively. The lifetime risk of developing ILD was 7.7% for RA patients and 0.9% for subjects without RA. The risk of developing ILD was higher in patients with older age at RA onset, among male patients and for individuals with parameters that indicate more severe RA. Survival of RA patients diagnosed with ILD was worse compared to RA patients without ILD. ILD contributed approximately 13% to the excess mortality of patients with RA patients when compared to the general population. History Rheumatoid Lung was first described in 1948. 1948, they published several cases of patients with RA who had severe erosive joint disease who also developed an interstitial lung and suggested there may be an association between the inflammatory joint disease and interstitial lung disease. 1953, Anthony Caplan described rheumatoid nodules within the lung parenchyma, associated with pneumoconiosis in coal miners, who were exposed to coal dust.MIALL WE, CAPLAN A, COCHRANE AL, KILPATRICK GS, OLDHAM PD. An epidemiological study of rheumatoid arthritis associated with characteristic chest x-ray appearances in coal-workers. Br Med J. 1953;2(4848):1231-1236. doi:10.1136/bmj.2.4848.1231 1954, rheumatoid lung nodules were found in patients with RA who were not exposed to coal dust and without pneumoconiosis. 1955 there was a short case series of about 10 patients with RA whose autopsies showed that the pleural disease was much higher in rheumatoid patients than in the general population, and much higher than what they had previously seen clinically. 1961, Cudkowicz described the first pulmonary function tests and lung biopsies were done in RA patients.  Research  According to a recent study, the main risk factors for RA-ILD are advancing age, male sex, greater RA disease activity, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and elevated titers of anticitrullinated protein antibodies such as anticyclic citrullinated peptide. Cigarette smoking also appears to increase risk of RA-ILD, especially in patients with human leukocyte antigen DRB1. A recently published retrospective study by a team from Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital in Beijing, China, supported three of the risk factors listed for RA-ILD and identified an additional risk factor. In that study of 550 RA patients, logistic regression analysis of data collected on the 237 (43%) with ILD revealed that age, smoking, RF positivity, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase closely correlated with ILD. Recent studies have identified risk factors for disease progression and mortality. A retrospective study of 167 patients with RA-ILD determined that the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was a risk factor for progression, as were severe disease upon diagnosis and rate of change in pulmonary function test results in the first 6 months after diagnosis. A study of 59 RA-ILD patients found no median survival difference between those with the UIP pattern and those without it. But the UIP group had more deaths, hospital admissions, need for supplemental oxygen, and decline in lung function.

His father, Varma (Sachin Khedekar) is mysteriously murdered as he goes to find a flat for Rahul. His friend Karan (Sanjay Suri), a rich salesman, gives his old flat to Rahul. After Rahul enters the flat, his life takes an unexpected turn when the unexplainable disappearance of Preeti takes place, and finally Rahul finds himself trapped in his own flat. With no connection to the outside world, Rahul is stuck and realises that a ghost is living in the flat with him, who won't let him go. He tries to contact Karan, but is unsuccessful. He then finds a diary in his room, which is opened by the ghost who allows him to read it. It turns out the diary belongs to Geethika (Hazel Crowney), a young village girl living out her childhood even at an adult age. She finds Karan coming to her village to build many buildings, and Karan uses Geethika's father's help. When her father cancels it of due to the suicide of her sister, Karan can't take the loss, and runs away with Geethika pretending to be in love with her. Back in a flashback, it is shown the two coming to foreign and getting married in the same flat Rahul is living in. Karan explains that he will return in a few days, but doesn't come back until many months. In his absence, Varma visits Geethika and takes advantage and tries to rape her. She uses self-defence, and tells him to get out. She begins to cry, only to realise she is pregnant. Karan comes back, and tells her to abort the baby because he is already married to someone else. She dies during the abortion, and Karan hides her body so nobody would blame him for her death. The diary ends, and Rahul investigates that the ghost is Geethika's, and it wants revenge on Karan. Firstly Rahul refuses, though when severely attacked several times, he agrees. He calls Karan over, and tells him everything. He gives the flat keys back, and walks out, and looking back, Karan is now trapped in the flat with no way of getting out. Rahul walks out of the building, and looks at the window, only to see Geethika's ghost approaching Karan, and the curtains closing with Karan shouting for help. Rahul now realises that except for Geethika's revenge, the ghost's appearance had another meaning, for him to sort out his love life with Preeti. He rings Preeti, and apologises about every mistake he did, the two make-up and get married.A Flat Movie Preview - Bollywood Hungama Cast * Jimmy Sheirgill as Rahul * Sanjay Suri as Karan * Hazel Crowney as Geethika * Kaveri Jha as Preeti * Sachin Khedekar as Varma * Aindritha Ray as Karan's Wife * Satwant Kaur as Mrs D.

It is commonly used in Pagani cars.  Properties  It is a combination of beta titanium alloy with advanced carbon composites, having a matched yield strength and moduli of elasticity ratio. When the combination is adhesively bonded both parts will approach maximum yield strength and fail at a similar amount of total strain. The components of carbotanium; carbon fiber and titanium, are woven together to form a strong, light material that can withstand significant amounts of heat and strain. This is because carbon fiber has the highest strength-to-density ratio of any current fiber and titanium has the highest strength-to-density ratio of any current metal. As a result, carbotanium can withstand temperatures up to 315 °C. The material properties of carbotanium are a mixture of those of a titanium alloy and a carbon fiber.  Manufacturing  The titanium and carbon composites are combined by first abrading the titanium to be bonded, coating the titanium with platinum. The titanium is then heated in an oven at 500 degrees Celsius for several hours. A primer is then sprayed onto the coated titanium. Next, an adhesive is applied to the primer side of the titanium and then finally, the carbon is applied to the adhesive. Usage The Pagani Zonda R, which is made from carbotanium. Carbotanium is a patented composite material invented by Modena Design, the carbon composite manufacturing and consultancy arm of the Italian car company Pagani. Pagani has applied this weave on their later extra strong and lightweight supercars, the Zonda R and Huayra. Although not all Zondas are made from carbotanium, some are formed from carbon fibre.

They are transmitted by bat flies, which act as an insect vector as well as the parasite’s site of sporogeny. Polychromophilus follows a fairly typical Haemospororidian lifecycle, with gametocytes and gametes restricted to the bloodstream of the host and meronts infecting organs – most notably the lungs and the liver. The type species is Polychromophilus melanipherus, and was described by Dionisi in 1898. Taxonomy Polychromophilus was first described by Dionisi in 1898, who also differentiated between the first two species, Polychromophilus murinus and Polychromophilus melanipherus. Both of these original species were named after their primary hosts – Vespertilio murinus and Miniopterus schreibersi respectively. In 1906, Schingareff managed to observe and describe merozoites within macrophages of Myotis daubentoni and Miniopterus schreibersi and suspected that nycteribiid flies acted as insect vectors. This was not evidenced until Corradetti discovered sporozoites within such flies in 1936, and was further supported by later research. The genus was divided into two subgenera — Polychromophilus and Bioccala but the subgenus Bioccala was raised to genus status in 1984. This genus along with Haemoproteus and Hepatocystis appears to be a sister clade to Plasmodium. It appears to have evolved from the avian/saurian clade of Plasmodium. Life cycle Polychromophilus sporozoites remain within the salivary glands of their insect vectors until a blood meal is taken. The sporozoites enter the primary host’s bloodstream and infect erythrocytes, inside of which the parasite develops into gametocytes. The gametocytes then proceed to sexually reproduce via gametogony, involving the exflagellation of the parasite forming numerous microgametes and macrogametes. The microgametes and macrogametes remain within the blood until they are taken in by an insect vector during another blood meal. The gametes then fuse in pairs within the gut of the insect, and the fertilised macrogamete develops into an ookinete. This then enters the body of the insect vector and further develops into an oocyst between the epithelial cells and basement membrane of the midgut. The oocyst then begins to divide into numerous sporozoites which remain within the thick oocyst capsule. Upon maturation, the oocyst bursts releasing the sporozoites into the insect vector, where they migrate toward the salivary gland ready to continue their cycle. The bursting of the oocysts leaves behind large residual bodies within the insect vector, which do not continue sporozoite development. Merogony of the parasite, although less well understood, has been observed to occur in a variety of organs and cell types of the primary bat host. Large bodies have been discovered in organs including the spleen and lungs, while small meronts have been found to develop within the Kupffer cells of the liver. The meronts are often transported around the body by macrophages in the blood. Hosts and habitat The genus Polychromophilus infects a diverse range of bats, and is present on every continent inhabited by their hosts. The type species, Polychromophilus melanipherus, was first observed in the Roman Campagna within the type host Miniopterus schreibersi. The presence of the parasite has since been discovered in numerous locations worldwide, including Israel, Australia, the Congo, Ethiopia, Brazil, and North America. The insect vectors of Polychromophilus comprise entirely of bat flies of three different genera – Basilia, Nycteribia, and Penicillidia. No other insects are known to carry the parasite. Host records *P. adami — least long fingered bat (Miniopterus minor minor) *P. corradetti — greater long fingered bat (Miniopterus inflatus) *P. melanipherus — little cave eptesicus (Eptesicus pumilus), greater wart nosed horseshoe bat (Hipposideros semoni), eastern long eared bat (Nyctophilus bifax), (Miniopterus blepotis), common bent wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii), (Vespadelus pumilis) *P. murinus — little bent wing bat (Miniopterus australis), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentoni), greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), Sundevall's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros caffer), southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius), Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteini), Adam's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus adami), Geoffroy's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus clivosus), Lander's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus landeri)  Description  Sporozoites are elongated and straight or slightly curved in shape, and not particularly motile. When prepared with a Giemsa-stain, their oval and slightly unconventional nucleus becomes visible. Their pellicle comprises a thin outer membrane separated from a double inner membrane, underneath which lies 21 subpellicular microtubules evenly spaced around the periphery. Many micronemes are present in the anterior tip of the sporozoite, and a single mitochondrion containing tubular cristae lies behind the nucleus. Gametocytes tend to take up almost the entirety of their host erythrocyte, and hence are covered by a thin layer of erythrocyte. They are contained within a trilaminar pellicle, consisting of a parasitophorous vacuole membrane, the gametocyte plasmalemma, and an inner double membrane. Multiple intracellular organelles are visible within the gametocytes, including mitochondria with tubular cristae, a Golgi apparatus, micronemes, primary lysosomes, and a microtubule organising centre comprising two centrioles. No visible cytosome is present. Microgametocytes stain pink with Giemsa, and contain a large diffuse nucleus lacking a visible nucleolus. Macrogametocytes, on the other hand, stain blue-purple due to a higher number of ribosomes within the cytoplasm and contain a small distinct nucleus with a clearly visible nucleolus. The gametocytes are known to doubly infect the same erythrocyte, a feature considered characteristic of some species. Oocysts are covered by an amorphous capsule comprising an inner granular layer and an outer lighter layer. The capsule is often observed to form invaginations into the oocyst cytoplasm.

The game is a first-person shooter where the player takes control of a special combat helicopter. The game's briefings and character looks are inspired by anime. Storyline After a major earthquake, the city of Tokyo is destroyed. Afterwards, a new city is created, called NeoTokyo. It is a technologically advanced society and the frontier of humanity's science. However, a new threat arises. An international criminal syndicate, known as Nemesys, led by Maxwell Giger, takes over the city with military force. Now, only a specially-designed squad of cops piloting high-tech combat helicopters can save NeoTokyo. Each of five combat pilots have their own archenemy among the ranks of Giger's five lieutenants. Upon choosing the one of pilots, the player has to complete four missions against Nemesys leaders. Then, another mission follows, where the player has to take down a leader who is the pilot's personal enemy. One final mission follows, where the player confronts Maxwell Giger himself and thwarts his plan to launch nuclear missiles. Gameplay The game has five characters to choose from, as well as five different helicopters, each with its own speed and ammo types. The character selection alters only the order in which the missions are given. While controlling the helicopter from the first-person view, the player navigates through levels, which range from city landscapes to gigantic caves. The game consists of six missions, each with about three levels. Using up to four ammo types, the player has to complete a specific task in each level, ranging from saving civilians and destroying an enemy vehicle to locating an artifact and destroying a specific building.

Combined Operations badge. The ISTDC came under the command of Combined Operations Headquarters in June 1940. The ISTDC came into being in May 1938http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersM2.html bringing together representatives from the Royal Navy, Army, and Royal Air Force convened with the portfolio of developing methods and equipment to use in Combined Operations.  Origins  The history of amphibious operations in the British Isles reaches back at least as far as Julius Caesar's legions crossing the Channel to invade from Gaul. For centuries the Royal Navy had been landing soldiers on hostile shores, prominent examples being Quebec 1759, Peking 1900, Zeebrugge 1918, and Gallipoli 1915–16.Keyes, p. 8 During the inter-war period, however, a combination of recent experience and economic stringency contributed to the delay in procuring equipment and adopting a universal doctrine for amphibious operations. The costly failure of the Gallipoli campaign during the First World War coupled with the emerging potential of airpower satisfied many in naval and military circles that the age of amphibious operations had come to a close.Maund, pp. 3–4 Still, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, animated discussion in Staff Colleges in Britain and the Indian Army Staff College at Quetta surrounded the strategic potential of the Dardanelles campaign compared with the strategic stalemate of the Western Front. The economic austerity of the worldwide economic depression and the government's adoption of the Ten Year Rule assured that such theoretical talk would not result in the procurement of any equipment. The Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich, drafted a document detailing combined operations requirements and submitted it to the Chiefs of Staff on 22 February 1936. Its principal author was the Director of the Staff College, Captain Bertram Watson, RN. The document synthesized the results of all the inter-Staff College studies of preceding years and made specific recommendations that two new organizations should be set up: a Permanent Committee, drawn from all three Service Ministries; and a Training and Development Centre, also to be inter-service. The Centre should have a permanent force attached to it, preferably of Royal Marines, and its functions were to be as follows: Another paper from Sir Ronald Adam, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, followed covering similar concerns. In May 1938 the Chiefs of Staff established the Inter-Services Training and Development Centre at Fort Cumberland, near Portsmouth.Ladd, 1976, p. 16 The Royal Marine contingent was not authorized; but there were four officers representing the three services (and one serving as adjutant), a small clerical staff, direct access to the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, and £30,000 (£10,000 from each of the services). The original officers appointed to the ISTDC were: *Captain Loben Edward Harold Maund, RN, Commandant of the ISTDC from 1 July 1938 to September 1939 *Major MWM MacLeod, Royal Artillery *Wing Commander Guy Knocker, Royal Air Force *Captain Peter- Picton-Phillips, Royal Marines, serving as Adjutant.Maund, p. 2 Service history The ISTDC existed only briefly, from May 1938 to mid-1942 (being briefly disbanded between September and December 1939). The Centre had direct access to the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint Intelligence Committee. It was also given authority to seek advice more broadly, contacting service departments such as the Director of Naval Construction with regard to hulls and the School of Musketry at Hythe regarding small arms ballistics. Also, ISTDC engaged private industry such as Fleming about small nesting boats and the Porton Gas School to design a floating smoke bomb.Maund, p. 18 The Centre was instructed to examine certain specific problems: *troop landings by air *air supply of stores and equipmenthttp://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/457/610/1/2/ *craft for landing tanks *beach organisation *floating piers *headquarters ships *amphibian tanks *underwater obstacles *the landing of water and petrol *the use of small craft in amphibious raidsFergusson, p. 40 By the end of 1939 the ISTDC had codified a policy for landings, and defended it at Staff College discussions. Operational experience would suggest modifications to this landing policy, but it would be essentially the policy used in the Torch and Husky landings four years later.Maund, p. The essential shape of this landing policy is described by Bernard Fergusson in The Watery Maze, The ISTDC staff went everywhere seeking material and devices and running experiments to discover how sea assaults could proceed. For ships with sufficient speed to become Landing Ships Infantry, the best available was a class of four fast passenger-carrying cargo ships (referred to as \\"cargo-liners\\") then under construction for Alfred Holt's Glen Line Far Eastern trade: the Glengyle, Glenearn, Glenroy, and Breconshire. This class could make eighteen knots, be equipped with suitable davits for hoisting out landing craft, and each be adapted to carry a complete battalion, plus some vehicles. They were duly earmarked for commandeering in the event of war. In March 1942 Louis Mountbatten was promoted to vice-admiral and was appointed to the new position of Chief of Combined Operations (CCO). Soon after, the decision was made to dismember the ISTDC. One part now came under COHQ's newly appointed Director of Experiments and Developments (later Director of Experiments and Operational Requirements, or DXOR). The other part became the Combined Operations Development Centre which in August 1942 was absorbed into the newly established Combined Ops Experimental Establishment (COXE) in North Devon.

Wilson is the head of academic affairs of the Center for Innovative Education and Prevention (CIEP) and BrainSMART. She presents at educational conferences in the United States and internationally and blogs regularly on Edutopia. She serves as advisor to New York City's Portfolio School and on the foundation of Carl Albert State College. Wilson completed her postdoctoral studies in structural cognitive modifiability prior to developing a graduate program putting cognitive research into practice while she served as chair of education at the University of Detroit Mercy. As a former classroom teacher, Wilson's professional focus is on empowering educators with opportunities for learning how to align teaching practices with current research about how students learn. She was lead developer of the Master of Science and Educational Specialist degree programs with a major in Brain-Based Teaching and the doctoral minor degree in Brain-Based Leadership with the Abraham S. Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.  Philosophy  From the beginning of her career as an elementary school teacher and school psychologist to her current work in teacher education, Wilson has advocated for empowering educators with the knowledge and skills they need to teach children in ways that they learn best so that they might achieve more of their unique potential. Her work with tens of thousands of classroom teachers is informed by a synergy of educational, cognitive, and brain research. She is codeveloper of the BrainSMART model, which offers practical strategies designed to help students maintain a healthy and optimistic state for learning, to make lessons meaningful, to maintain students’ focus and attention on learning, to retain what they have learned, and to transfer and demonstrate their new knowledge in assessments and real-life applications.Wilson, D.L., & Conyers, M.A. (2011).

She also codeveloped Thinking for Results, a process for equipping students with the cognitive tools they need to actualize their learning potential.Wilson, D.L., & Conyers, M.A. (2011). Thinking for Results: Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement by as Much as 30 Percent (4th ed.). Orlando, FL: BrainSMART.  Education and professional experience  Wilson earned her PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Oklahoma and is a Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP). She also completed postdoctoral studies at the International Center for the Enhancement of Learning Potential with Reuven Feuerstein and Alex Kozulin. As an assistant professor in the Psychology Department at Valdosta State University, Wilson began her university career as a teacher educator at the undergraduate level. She later chaired the Education Department at the University of Detroit Mercy, where she codeveloped a unique cohort and field-based master's degree for teachers with a focus on cognition and motivation in diverse classrooms. Wilson co-led two educational research projects: (1) the implementation of a brain-based teaching approach supported by a Challenge Grant from the Annenberg Foundation with Florida Atlantic University and (2) a three-year Florida Department of Education initiative on brain-based teaching, Scholarships for Teachers in Action Research (STAR). The effectiveness of the latter initiative led to the development of Master of Science and Educational Specialist degrees with a major in Brain-Based Teaching through Nova Southeastern University.

She has worked in the United States of America, Nigeria, Kenya, and New Zealand. In New Zealand she set up an abortion service before the law was liberalised. She was an elected member of the General Medical Council for more than 16 years. She was shortlisted for the BMJ Group Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.\\" In 1985, she was accused of incompetence by the professor in her department (Professor Jurgis Gediminas Grudzinskas) and suspended from her post at the London Hospital Medical College, but she was cleared of all charges and reinstated in 1986 following a high-profile enquiry.

In 1991 she made an extended appearance on the television discussion programme After Dark alongside Helen Brook, John Finnis, Mary Kenny and others. She was co-chair of the pressure group Keep Our NHS Public. She is a publicly elected Governor for Islington in the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, and was further elected by her fellow Governors to serve on the Remuneration and Nominations committee, which then chose her as chair of that committee. She was also elected by Governors to serve on the Council of Governors' Steering Committee. In 2018 she was awarded the BMJ Award for Outstanding Contribution to Health. 2017 views on terminations Professor Savage was interviewed by the Mail on Sunday in March 2017. Professor Savage was described as saying people should be allowed to have an abortion at any stage of a pregnancy and abortion pills should be available online without the need to see a doctor or nurse. She stressed that abortion beyond 24 weeks is very rare. Professor Savage was further quoted as saying there is no evidence that sex-selective abortion is a problem in the UK and that, consequently, policies to not tell expectant mothers in the UK the sex of the foetus are unnecessary. She was further quoted as arguing that forcing women to give birth to a child of a sex they do not want \\"is not going to be good for the eventual child, and it's not going to be good for mental health.\\" Conservative MP Mark Field was quoted by the Mail on Sunday as calling Professor Savage’s views (as put to him by the paper) “extreme” and told the newspaper: “Suggesting that women should be able to abort babies solely because they happen to be either male or, much more usually, female, is utterly abhorrent. Globally, sex-selective abortion is thought to have led to millions of girls being aborted, and both the United Nations and the World Health Organisation have campaigns to stamp it out.\\" The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) informed the Independent which wrote about the Mail on Sunday's story it was \\"totally appalled\\" by the Mail on Sunday's front page \\"demonising Wendy Savage, a doctor who has devoted her life to supporting pregnant women.\\" The Independent further quoted BPAS as saying: “Wendy believes women should not be prosecuted for causing their own abortion with pills bought online. We agree and so do two thirds of the public.

It has no systemic manifestations, unlike the other type of the dystrophy, Lattice corneal dystrophy type II. Lattice corneal dystrophy was first described by Swiss ophthalmologist Hugo Biber in 1890.H. Biber: Über einige seltenere Hornhauterkrankungen. Zürich, 1890. Inaugural Dissertation, Zurich, 1890. Cited by O. Haab: Die gittrige Keratitis. Lattice dystrophy gets its name from an accumulation of amyloid deposits, or abnormal protein fibers, throughout the middle and anterior stroma.  Presentation  Filamentous opacities appear in the cornea with intertwining delicate branching processes. During an eye examination, the doctor sees these deposits in the stroma as clear, comma- shaped overlapping dots and branching filaments, creating a lattice effect. Over time, the lattice lines will grow opaque and involve more of the stroma. They will also gradually converge, giving the cornea a cloudiness that may also reduce vision. The disease is bilateral, usually noted before the end of the first decade of life. Although lattice dystrophy can occur at any time in life, the condition usually arises in children between the ages of two and seven. In some people, these abnormal protein fibers can accumulate under the cornea's outer layer—the epithelium. This can cause erosion of the epithelium. This condition is known as recurrent epithelial erosion. These erosions alter the cornea's normal curvature, resulting in temporary vision problems, and expose the nerves that line the cornea, causing severe pain. Even the involuntary act of blinking can be painful. In systemic cases, kidney failure, heart failure and neuropathy such as facial nerve palsy, laxity of the skin may be noted.  Genetics  Lattice corneal dystrophy type II. Black and white light micrograph showing deposits of amyloid in cornea. Congo red stain. Diagram depicting gelsolin and the amyloid protein derived from it because of mutations in codon Lattice corneal dystrophy has two types: * type I: with no systemic association. It is caused by mutations in TGFBI gene encoding keratoepithelin, which maps to chromosome 5q. * type II or Finnish type amyloidosis: associated with manifestations of systemic amyloidosis due to accumulation of gelsolin. Associated conditions may include cutis laxa and ataxia. * type III is also described which has an onset at age 70 to 90 years and is not associated with systemic amyloidosis. Diagnosis In the examination of biomicroscopy, it appears as branches spread on the corneal stroma in the appearance of ghost vessels. diagnosis can also be confirmed with anterior segment OCT (visante OCT ,spetral domain OCT).The interwoven linear opaque filaments have some resemblance to NERVES, but may not be observed in all affected members of families with the condition. Recurrent corneal erosions may precede the corneal opacities and even appear in individuals lacking recognizable stromal disease. Amyloid deposits are found throughout the corneal stroma. Linear and other shaped opaque areas accumulate particularly within the central corneal stroma, while the peripheral cornea remains relatively transparent.  Treatment  In case of corneal erosion, a doctor may prescribe eye drops and ointments to reduce the friction on the eroded cornea. In some cases, an eye patch may be used to immobilize the eyelids. With effective care, these erosions usually heal within three to seven days, although occasional sensations of pain may occur for the next six- to-eight weeks. As patients with LCD suffer with dry eyes as a result of erosion, a new technique involving the insertion of punctal plugs (both upper and lower) can reduce the amount of drops used a day, aiding ocular stability. By about age 40, some people with lattice dystrophy will have scarring under the epithelium, resulting in a haze on the cornea that can greatly obscure vision. In this case, a corneal transplantation may be needed. There have been many cases in which teenage patients have had the procedure, which accounts for the change in severity of the condition from person to person. Although people with lattice dystrophy have an excellent chance for a successful corneal transplantation, the disease may also arise in the donor cornea in as little as three years. In one study, about half of the transplant patients with lattice dystrophy had a recurrence of the disease between two and 26 years after the operation. Of these, 15 percent required a second corneal transplant. Early lattice and recurrent lattice arising in the donor cornea responds well to treatment with the excimer laser. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using [Excimer laser] can restore and preserve useful visual function for a significant period of time in patients with anterior corneal dystrophies.

He became a Catholic and supported King James II at the time of the Glorious Revolution. Background and early life Hales was the only son of Sir Edward Hales, 2nd Baronet, of Tunstall, Kent, a Royalist, by his wife Anne Wotton, the youngest of the four daughters and coheirs of Thomas Wotton, 2nd Baron Wotton. He was a descendant of John Hales, baron of the exchequer. He was educated at University College, and his tutor Obadiah Walker influenced him in the direction of Roman Catholicism. Career under Charles II On 28 November 1673 Hales was admitted to the rank of colonel of a foot regiment at Hackington, Kent. He purchased Hales Place (the mansion and estate of St. Stephen's parish, near Canterbury), where his descendants afterwards resided. He was elected Member of Parliament for Canterbury in 1679 and held the seat until 1681. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1684. Catholicism Hales declared himself a Catholic on the accession of James II and was formally reconciled to the Catholic Church on 11 November 1685. He had not received the sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England within three months of his commission in 1673, contrary to the statute 25 Charles II and had not taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. James II now gave him a dispensation from these obligations by letters patent under the Great Seal. In order to determine the legality of the exercise of his dispensing power in such cases, a test action was arranged. Arthur Godden, Sir Edward's coachman, was instructed to bring a qui tam action against his master for the penalty of £500, due to the informer under the act of Charles II. Hales was indicted and convicted at the assizes held at Rochester 28 March 1686. He pleaded the king's dispensation, and on appeal the question was argued at length in the court of king's bench before Sir Edward Herbert, Lord Chief Justice of England. On 21 June 1686, Herbert, after consulting his colleagues on the bench, delivered judgment in favour of Hales, and asserted the dispensing power to be part of the king's prerogative. The dispensing power was effectively outlawed by the Bill of Rights in 1689. Career under James II Hales was sworn into the privy council, and appointed one of the lords of the admiralty, deputy-warden of the Cinque ports, and lieutenant of Dover Castle, and in June 1687 Lieutenant of the Tower of London. Narcissus Luttrell mentions, in June 1688, a rumour that he was about to have a Catholic chapel in the Tower. When the seven bishops were discharged from his custody he demanded fees of them; but they refused, on the ground that their detention and Hales's commission were both illegal. The lieutenant hinted that if they came into his hands again they should feel his power. Flight and exile Hales was dismissed from his post at the Tower in November 1688. James II, with Hales as one of his three companions, and disguised as Hales's servant, left Whitehall on 11 December, in the hope of escaping to France. The boat carrying them was discovered the next day as it lay in the river off Faversham, and the king and his three attendants were brought on shore. Hales was recognised, and kept prisoner at the courthouse at Faversham. Immediately after the king's departure for London he was conveyed to Maidstone gaol, and afterwards to the Tower, where he remained for a year and a half. On 26 October 1689 he was brought up to the bar of the House of Commons, and ordered to be charged with high treason in being reconciled to the church of Rome. On 31 January 1690 he and Obadiah Walker were brought by habeas corpus from the Tower to the bar of the king's bench, and were bailed on good security; but both were excepted out of the act of pardon dated 23 May following. Eventually Hales obtained his discharge on 2 June 1690. Hales went in October 1690 to St. Germain-en-Laye, but he was little employed by James II other than as friend. James rewarded his services by creating him Earl of Tenterden in Kent, Viscount Tunstall, and Baron Hales of Emley, by patent 3 May 1692. Edward Hasted wrote that Hales's son and successor in the baronetcy, Sir John Hales, was offered a peerage by George I, but the matter dropped, because Sir John insisted on his right to his father's titles, and to precedence according to that creation. Final years In 1694, Hales applied to the Earl of Shrewsbury for a licence to return to England, but he died, without obtaining it, in 1695, and was buried in the Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris. By the schedule to his will, dated July 1695, he bequeathed £5,000, to be disposed of according to his instructions by Bonaventure Giffard and Dr. Thomas Witham. Hales left in manuscript a journal of his life, which Charles Dodd used in his Church History. Family Hales married Frances Windebank, daughter of Sir Francis Windebank of Oxfordshire and had five sons and seven daughters. Edward, his eldest son, was killed in the service of James II at the Battle of the Boyne, and John, the second son (died 1744), accordingly succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on the death of the sixth baronet, Sir Edward Hales, without issue, on 15 March 1829.

He served in the Montana State Legislature in 1890. Biography Toole was born in Aroostook County, Maine on July 3, 1849, and moved to Madison, Wisconsin with his parents in 1855. He began working in the mining industry in Utah in 1873. Five years later, in 1878, he took his mining career to Idaho where he met his wife, Anna Hardenbrook. They had six children: Honora, Thula, Allan, Howard, Brice, and John R. Jr. The family moved to Anaconda, Montana, in 1884. While living in Anaconda, Toole worked for Marcus Daly's smelter and became known as Daly's right-hand man. Toole was elected to the territorial legislature in 1886 and reelected in 1888. He was nominated to the state legislature in 1889 and was part of the Montana Constitutional Convention.List of Montana Constitutional Convention Members In 1900, the Toole family relocated to Missoula, Montana, where Toole became president of the Big Blackfoot Milling Company. Toole died on March 4, 1916 in California and was buried in Missoula Cemetery. John R. Toole Family Papers at the University of Montana Mansfield Library  Family  right Toole married Anna Hardenbrook on November 2, 1882. Their first child Honora was born in 1883. She eventually married John R. Clifton. The couple's second daughter Thula was born in 1885 and married George Weisel. Their first son Allan was born in 1887, followed by Howard born in 1890. Howard would eventually marry Marjorie Ross. The third son Brice was born in 1893, followed by John R. Jr. Today, Missoula has a street named Toole Avenue as well as a John H. Toole Park. John Howard Toole, for whom the Park is named was the grandson of John R. Toole, first son of Howard Toole and Marjorie Ross. John H. was a decorated World War II veteran who became a successful businessman and eventually served as Mayor of Missoula. He died in 1991.  Big Blackfoot Milling Company The Anaconda Mining Company, which was owned by copper-king Marcus Daly, began expanding and established a milling company in Missoula. The purpose of the company was to harvest timber to run Anaconda's smelter. John R. Toole became president of the company shortly after he moved to Missoula. The mill was known by various other names over the years, including Hammond-Bonner Lumber Mill, the Anaconda Mill and the Western Lumber Mill. By 1900, the Big Blackfoot Milling Company had depleted much of its timber supply and started cutting further up the Blackfoot. Most of the logs were floated down the river to Bonner.Two Rivers History Toole house leftThe neoclassical Toole home in Missoula, located on Gerald Avenue, was designed in 1902 by architect J.F. Everett. Everett followed the style of the popular World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Twelve-foot ceilings, pocket doors and oak columns are just a few of the features in the house. It also has seven fireplaces and, according to Toole, \\"There was not a more attractive fireside in Montana.\\" A Palladian window and fan lights line the main entry.Montana Historical Places Anna Hardenbrook Toole sold the house in 1931 to Kappa Kappa Gamma, giving a home to the first sorority in Missoula. Two of Toole's daughters, as well as granddaughters, great-granddaughters and a daughter-in-law, have been members of Kappa Kappa Gamma and called the house their home during their college years. Three additions have been made to the house, but it still retains its original symmetry and classical ornamentation.

He was born in Dublin, the third son of Timothy Daniel Sullivan, a prominent Home Rule Party MP and Lord Mayor of Dublin. Through his sister Anne who married Dr. Thomas Higgins, he was the uncle of Kevin O'Higgins and great-uncle of another Chief Justice, Tom O'Higgins. His aunt had married Timothy Michael Healy, the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and Sullivan in turn married their daughter Maeve.Ferguson, Kenneth ed. King's Inns Barristers 1868-1968 Kings Inns Dublin 2005 He was called to the Bar in 1895. In 1913, Sullivan married his cousin Maeve Healy, daughter of Timothy Healy. Maeve was an artist who painted the well-known portrait of her husband in his judicial robes.Ferguson Kings Inns Barristers 1868-1968 They had no children. His strongly nationalist background made him acceptable to the new Government of the Irish Free State as a member of the new judiciary and accordingly, in 1924, he was appointed President of the High Court; in 1936, on the death of Hugh Kennedy he was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland and served until he reached retirement age in 1946. His most notable judgment was the upholding by the Supreme Court in 1940 of the Constitutionality of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill which allowed for indefinite detention of suspected IRA members. An apparently casual remark of Sullivan that he was giving judgment \\"for the majority\\" caused controversy and led to the Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland 1941 providing for a single judgment only in such cases. There was further controversy in the 1960s when an academic claimed that Sullivan had \\"packed\\" the Court in favour of the Government by persuading James Creed Meredith to step down in favour of Conor Maguire. The claim seems to be unfounded: Sullivan was a firm believer in judicial independence, and in any case by 1940 any political sympathies he had were with the Opposition, not the Government.Hogan, Gerard (2000) \\" The Supreme Court and the reference of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill 1940, Irish Jurist 35:257 His cousin Maurice Healy in his celebrated memoir \\"The Old Munster Circuit\\" Michael Joseph Ltd.

It was preceded by a number of regions which were in Jewish rule in the north-west part of Ethiopia. The Jewish-Ethiopian tradition dates the establishment of the Kingdom of Semien to the fourth century, right after the kingdom of Axum turned to Christianity during the reign of Ezana of Axum.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, Vol. I, p. 485Steven Kaplan, The Beta Israel (Falasha) in Ethiopia, p. 94 Incumbents = Gideons dynasty = A dynasty of Ethiopian kings and privileged descendants of Zadok who was a high priest during the reign of King David and King Solomon. According to the tradition of the Beta Israel community, Zadok's son Azariah was sent to Ethiopia together with Menelik. * King Phineas – the first king of the Beta Israel during the time period of emperor Ezana of Axum. * King Gideon IV – the father of Queen Judith. * Queen Judith – (c. 960 – c. 1000) destroyed the Aksumite Empire. * King Gideon V – (1434–1468) led the revolt against the emperor Zara Yaqob. * King Joram – the king of the Beta Israel during the time period of emperor Gelawdewos of Ethiopia. * King Radi – King of the Beta Israel after King Joram during time period of emperor Menas of Ethiopia. * King Caleb – King of the Beta Israel after King Radi during time period of emperor Sarsa Dengel of Ethiopia. * King Goshen – King of the Beta Israel during time period of emperor Sarsa Dengel. * King Gideon VII – King of the Beta Israel during time period of emperor Susenyos of Ethiopia. * King Pinchas – King of the Beta Israel after Gideon VII. * King Binyam Selamun King of the Beta Israel after King Pinchas Beta Esrael kingdom in the second millenium  Name  According to the Beta Israel tradition, during its time the kingdom was called the \\"Kingdom of the Gideons\\", after the name of the dynasty of Jewish kings that ruled it. A document from the 10th century by an Arab historian states that the name of the kingdom which took over the empire of Aksum after the revolt of Queen Judith is \\"ha-Dani\\". This document might validate the documents of Eldad ha-Dani, who mentioned that the Tribe of Dan exiled voluntarily and established an independent kingdom. Between the 15th century and the early 17th century the Ethiopian Empire referred to the kingdom as \\"Falasha\\". This name was later on popularized and also appears in Jewish writings from that period. The 16th century geographer Livio Sanuto referred to the kingdom as \\"Land of the Jews\\" (\\"Judaeorum Terra\\") in his \\"Tabula X\\" map published in 1588. Leo Africanus also referred to the kingdom of Beta Israel as \\"Land of the Jews\\" (\\"terra de' Giudei\\"). Another name which was very common in the 16th and 17th centuries was the \\"Kingdom of Semien\\" – given to the kingdom after the area which it dominated after it lost control over the regions of Dembiya and Wegera.  History  = Establishment = Ezana According to the Beta Israel tradition, the Jewish kingdom of Beta Israel or kingdom of Semien was initially established after Ezana was crowned as the Emperor of Axum (in 325 CE). Ezana, who was educated in his childhood by the missionary Frumentius, declared Christianity as the religion of the Ethiopian empire after he was crowned. The inhabitants who practiced Judaism and refused to convert to Christianity began revolting – this group was referred to as \\"Beta Israel\\" by the emperor. The Beta Israel kingdom was eventually established after a civil war between the Jewish population and the Christian population.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, Page 408. The Jewish rebels wanted to distinguish themselves from the people who practiced Christianity and therefore during that civil war the Jewish community began to migrate out of the Empire towards the Semien Mountains region and the province of Dembiya – regions located north of Lake Tana and south of the Tekezé River – at that time this region (Semien) was not an integral part of the Axum Empire and as a result, the Jews began to establish their kingdom in Semien. They crowned the first king, Phineas, a descendant of the Jewish High Priest Zadok, and started a period of territorial expansion eastward and southward. \\"Judith's Field\\": an area full of ruins of destroyed buildings which according to tradition were ruined by the forces of Queen Judith. During the mid 9th century the empire of Aksum began a new expansion which led to an armed conflict between the Empire forces and the Beta Israel forces. The Beta Israel kingdom under King Gideon the fourth managed to defeat the Axum forces. Nevertheless, during the battle king Gideon was killed. As a result, Gideon's daughter Judith (Gudit) inherited the kingdom from her father and took command. Judith's first challenge was to stop any future invasions to the kingdom by the Christian Aksumite Empire. As a result, Judith formed a military alliance with the Agaw, who also opposed the expansion of the Christian Aksumite Empire. Around 960, the large tribal confederation led by Queen Judith, which included both forces of the Agaw tribes and the Beta Israel forces, invaded the capital of Axum and conquered and destroyed the city of Axum (including many churches and monasteries which were burned and destroyed) and imposed Jewish rule over Axum.Jamie Stokes, Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Vol. I, p. 223Hannah Adams, The history of the Jews: from the destruction of Jerusalem to the present time, Vol. II, p. 35 In addition, the Axumite throne was snatched and the forces of Queen Judith sacked and burned the Debre Damo monastery which at the time was a treasury and a prison for the male relatives of the emperor of Ethiopia, killing all of the potential heirs of the emperor. After the fall of the Axum Empire, Queen Judith crowned herself as the empress and appointed governors in the provinces which were conquered. Queen Judith ruled over the territory she conquered for around 40 years, establishing trade relations with the neighboring countriesStuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity, p. 110 and eventually passing the throne on to her descendants. The Golden Age of the Beta Israel kingdom took place, according to the Ethiopian tradition, between the years 858–1270, in which the Jewish kingdom flourished. During that period the world Jewry heard for the first time the stories of Eldad ha-Dani who apparently visited the kingdom. Marco Polo and Benjamin of Tudela also mention an independent Ethiopian Jewish kingdom in the writings from that period. This period ends with the rise of the Christian Solomonic dynasty. = Wars and collapse = In 1270 the Christian Solomonic dynasty was restoredTeshome G. Wagaw, For our soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel, p. 249 after the crowning of a monarch who claimed descent from the single royal prince who managed to escape Queen Judith's uprising. For the next three centuries the Solomonic Dynasty emperors conducted a long and ongoing series of armed confrontations with the Jewish Kingdom. In 1329, Emperor Amda Seyon campaigned in the northwest provinces of Semien, Wegera, Tselemt, and Tsegede, in which many had been converting to Judaism and where the Beta Israel had been gaining prominence.Pankhurst, Richard, The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century (Asmara: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 79. He sent troops there to fight people \\"like Jews\\" (Ge'ez ከመ:አይሁድ kama ayhūd).Steven Kaplan, \\"Betä Əsraʾel\\", in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A–C (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p. 553. During the reign of Emperor Yeshaq (1414–1429) who invaded the Jewish kingdom, annexed it and began to exert religious pressure. Yeshaq divided the occupied territories of the Jewish kingdom into three provinces which were controlled by commissioners appointed by him. He reduced the Jews' social status below that of Christians and forced the Jews to convert or lose their land. It would be given away as rist, a type of land qualification that rendered it forever inheritable by the recipient and not transferable by the Emperor. Yeshaq decreed, \\"He who is baptized in the Christian religion may inherit the land of his father, otherwise let him be a Falāsī.\\" This may have been the origin for the term \\"Falasha\\" (falāšā, \\"wanderer,\\" or \\"landless person\\"). By 1450 the Jewish kingdom managed to annex back the territories it lost beforehand and began preparing to fight the armies of the emperor. The Beta Israel forces invaded the Ethiopian Empire in 1462 but lost the campaign and many of its military forces were killed. Later on the forces of the Ethiopian emperor invaded the Kingdom of Semien in the region of Begemder and massacred many of the Jews in that region throughout a period of seven years. Although the area of the kingdom became significantly smaller afterwards, the Jews were able to eventually restore their kingdom. Between the years 1529 until 1543 the Muslim Adal Sultanate armies with the assistance of forces from the Ottoman Empire invaded and fought the Ethiopian Empire and came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Ethiopia. During that time period the Jews made a pact with the Ethiopian Empire. The leaders of the Kingdom of Beta Israel changed their alliance during the war and began supporting the Muslim Adal Sultanate armies. The Adal Sultanate armies did not see in favor the Jewish kingdom's change of alliance and continued the fight against them, and later on conquered different regions of the Jewish Kingdom, severely damaged its economy and killed many of its members. As a result, the leaders of the Beta Israel kingdom turned to the Ethiopian empire and their allies the Portuguese and requested their assistance in conquering the kingdom regions back from the Adal Sultanate. The forces of the Ethiopian empire eventually succeeded in conquering the kingdom and freeing Ethiopia from Ahmed Gragn. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian empire decided to declare war against the Jewish Kingdom of Semien due to the Jewish leaders' change of position during the Ethiopian–Adal War. With the assistance of Portuguese forces from the Order of the Jesuits, the Ethiopian empire, under the rule of Emperor Gelawdewos, invaded the Jewish kingdom and executed the Jewish king Joram. As a result of this battle, the areas of kingdom became significantly smaller and now included only the region of the Semien Mountains. In the 16th century, the Chief Rabbi of Egypt, Rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) proclaimed that in terms of halakha (Jewish legal code), the Ethiopian community was certainly Jewish.Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, From tragedy to triumph: the politics behind the rescue of Ethiopian Jewry, Page 19. After the execution of king Joram, King Radi became the leader of the Beta Israel kingdom. King Radi also fought against the Ethiopian Empire which at that period of time was ruled by Emperor Menas. The forces of the Jewish kingdom managed to conquer the area south of the kingdom and strengthened their defenses in the Semien Mountains. The battles against the forces of emperor Menas were successful as the Ethiopian empire forces were eventually defeated. The Ras Dashen area which used to be part of the kingdom During the reign of emperor Sarsa Dengel the Jewish kingdom was invaded and the forces of the Ethiopian empire besieged the kingdom, the Jews survived the siege, but at the end of the siege the King Goshen was executed and many of his soldiers as well as many other Beta Israel members committed mass suicide. When the Ethiopian empire forces invaded to Semien region they encountered resistance from the new king Gideon VII. The forces of the Ethiopian empire eventually decided to end the blockade and the Jewish kingdom was restored. During the reign of emperor Susenyos, the Ethiopian empire waged war against the Jewish kingdom and managed to conquer the kingdom and annex it to the Ethiopian empire by 1627.

A Vintage Sign Promoting Merita Bread  Origins  William Fisch and Herman Malchow, who for three years had been operating a lunchroom in Birmingham, Alabama, established the Highland Bakery, which began producing breads in 1901. Starting with a single horse-and-wagon route and one retail bakeshop, the business grew and flourished. Legend has it that in the company's early years, an award known as the MERIT-A award, signifying highest merit, was conferred on some bakery products. This company consistently won the award and displayed the symbol “MERIT-A” on the packages. By mistake, a printer left out the hyphen and thus the name MERITA was born. In 1910, Highland Baking Company merged with the Martin Cracker and Candy Company and the Huston Biscuit Company to form American Bakeries Candy Company. In 1912 candy production was halted, and the company was incorporated as American Bakeries Company, Inc. Merita set up its first “bakery research laboratory” in 1921 to guard the purity and quality of its raw materials all the way through to finished products. The Merita division of American Bakeries was purchased by Interstate Bakeries Corporation (later Hostess Brands, Inc.) in 1988. After the closure and liquidation of Hostess Brands in late 2012, Merita was sold to Flowers Foods for $390 million, in a deal that also included other Hostess bread brands such as Wonder Bread, Nature's Pride, Home Pride and Butternut.  Marketing  In 1938 Merita brought The Lone Ranger radio adventures to the South for the first time. Broadcasts were three times a week for a half-hour on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Additionally, in 1949, Merita becoming the first advertiser in the South to sponsor a network television program when it sponsored The Lone Ranger television show. Muppets, Inc. produced six 10-second commercials for Merita Bread in 1963 for markets in the southern US. The ads featured Wilkins and Wontkins. In November 2010, Merita became the \\"official bread\\" of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and all SEC Championship events through June 2013.

The film was released on 17 December 2010 under the Beyond Dreams Entertainment Ltd. banner. Plot The film features Kaalo, a devilish witch who lived in Kulbhata during the 18th century. She was killed and buried by angry villagers for sacrificing young girl children to satisfy her greed for immortality, but her fear lived on. Years later villagers spoke of Kaalo's sightings yet again. They claimed she was even more angry and dangerous and she was back to finish what she left incomplete. Kulbhata was vacated overnight by scared villagers. All roads leading to Kulbhata were sealed by horrifying tales of Kaalo killing anyone who dared to enter Kulbhata until a bus carrying eleven passengers on its way to Kuldevi had to pass through Kulbhata. One of the passengers on the bus was a twelve-year-old girl named Shona (Swini Khara), who was traveling alone to spend her vacation at her grandmother's house in the neighboring village. Shona was clever, witty and cheerful. She soon became the life of the journey. Everyone loved her endearing manners. Especially the reclusive and reticent Sameer (Aditya Srivastav), who was traveling with a bag loaded with gunpowder to blast a small hillock which would give way to a water canal for his drought hit village. Badly disfigured and thirsty for blood, Kaalo could smell Shona from miles away and headed straight for the bus. She would kill everyone who came in her way, she had to have the girl anyhow. When the passengers suddenly realized they were staring into death everything changed. From being the life of the journey, Shona became their very reason for dying. Everyone wanted her out of the bus, some even used her as a bait to lure Kaalo away from themselves. Human relations changed as they fought for their survival. No one except Sameer had the guts to stand up for Shona. It didn't matter to him whether Kaalo was a creature or a witch. All he knew was that he has to protect Shona at any cost because time was running out for him and his co- passengers who were still alive! At the end of the movie, Sameer pierces two sticks in Kaalo's eyes making her blind and inserts a knife in Kaalo's body. Now for Kaalo was not able to see anything, Sameer hangs the gunpowder bag on Kaalo's neck and lights the gunpowder. Kaalo explodes into pieces and goes underneath the earth. At the end of movie, Shona and Sameer go towards home.

Capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes, 2000 aircraft were ordered, but only around 200 were built. The type saw some service in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese, but continuing developmental issues affecting the aircraft, along with the success of operations using more conventional weapons, led to the decision being made to cancel the assault drone program in October 1944. Design and development In 1936, Lieutenant Commander Delmar S. Fahrney proposed that unpiloted, remotely controlled aircraft had potential for use by the United States Navy in combat operations. Due to the limitations of the technology of the time, development of the \\"assault drone\\" project was given a low priority, but by the early 1940s the development of the radar altimeter and television made the project more feasible, and following trials using converted manned aircraft, the first operational test of a drone against a naval target was conducted in April 1942. That same month, following trials of the Naval Aircraft Factory TDN assault drone, Interstate Aircraft received a contract from the Navy for two prototype and 100 production aircraft to a simplified and improved design, to be designated TDR-1. Control of the TDR-1 would be conducted from either a control aircraft, usually a Grumman TBF Avenger, with the operator viewing a tv screen showing the view from a camera mounted aboard the drone along with the radar altimeter's readout, or via a pilot on board the TDR-1 for test flights. Powered by two Lycoming O-435 engines of each, the TDR-1 used a remarkably simple design, with a steel-tube frame constructed by the Schwinn bicycle company covered with a molded wood skin, thus making little use of strategic materials so as not to impede production of higher priority aircraft. Capable of being optionally piloted for test flights, an aerodynamic fairing was used to cover the cockpit area during operational missions. The TDR-1 was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear that would be jettisoned in operation after takeoff for improved performance. In September 1942, the U.S. Navy chose DeKalb, Illinois to be the site for the manufacture of the drone TDR-1 aircraft, and built an airport on the city's east side. This early airport consisted of an airfield and a large hangar that were fenced and guarded around the clock. DeKalb was chosen because Wurlizter, manufacturer of pianos, and known for its expertise in the production of wood products, was located there. Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation (based in El Segundo, CA) assembled the planes at the new airport in DeKalb.Selig, Nicholas C., \\"Forgotten Chicago Airfields.\\" Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2014 -- Chapter on \\"DeKalb Airport\\" (ebook not paginated). About two hundred drones were built, tested, and boxed at the DeKalb Airport and were shipped to the South Pacific, where they were used against the enemy during World War II.″Flying high: On the record ... with Tom Cleveland\\" in The Midweek, Dec. 16, 2014 -- https://www.midweeknews.com/2014/12/12/flying-high/a75tihu/ Operational history Interstate XBQ-4 Under the code-name Operation Option, the U.S. Navy projected that up to 18 squadrons of assault drones would be formed, with 162 Grumman TBF Avenger control aircraft and 1000 assault drones being ordered.Zaloga 2008, p.8. However technical difficulties in the development of the TDR-1, combined with a continued low priority given to the project, saw the contract modified with the order reduced to only around 300 aircraft. A single TDR-1 was tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the XBQ-4, however no production contract resulted from this testing. , transporting TDR-1s and associated TBM Avenger control aircraft to South West Pacific theatre (June 1944) In 1944, under the control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was deployed operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese.Newcome 2004, p.68. Additional testing was conducted by SATFOR in July, complete with a strike against a previously beached Japanese freighter, Yumasuki Maru, including management of the flight from a distant TBM Avenger control aircraft, which could monitor the view from the TDRs via early television technology. SATFOR equipped a single mixed squadron, Special Task Air Group 1 (STAG-1), with TDR-1 aircraft and TBM Avenger control aircraft; the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1. Following the war, some TDR-1s were converted for operation as private sportsplanes.Goebel 2010 Variants and operators Interstate XTD3R * XTDR-1 – Two prototypes. * TDR-1 – Production version of XTDR-1, 189 aircraft produced. * XTD2R-1 – Variant with two Franklin O-805-2 engines, two prototypes ordered, canceled in favor of TD3R. * XTD3R-1 – Variant with Wright R-975 radial engines, three prototypes. * XTD3R-2 – Variant of XTD3R-1, one prototype. * TD3R-1 – Production version of XTD3R-1, 40 aircraft ordered but cancelled. * XBQ-4 – Army designation for TDR-1.

Measuring , it depicts a coppice near Warter, Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire and is the largest painting Hockney has completed. It was painted in the East Riding of Yorkshire between February and March 2007. The painting's alternative title alludes to the technique Hockney used to create the work, a combination of painting out of doors and in front of the subject (called in French ‘sur le motif’) whilst also using the techniques of digital photography. Subject The painting, a landscape near the village of Warter, between Bridlington and York, is set just before the arrival of spring when trees are coming into leaf. The painting is dominated by a large sycamore which features in 30 of the 50 panels. In the shallow foreground space a copse of tall trees and some daffodils stand on slightly raised ground. Another, denser copse is visible in the background. A road to the extreme left and two buildings to the right and rear of the composition offer signs of human habitation. Much of the painting's extensive upper half is devoted to the intricate pattern of overlapping branches, clearly delineated against a pale winter sky. Background Although Hockney has lived in Los Angeles since 1978, he always returned to spend Christmas at his mother's house in Bridlington. From 2004 onwards he spent increasing lengths of time in Yorkshire; the rolling chalk hills around Bridlington became the focus of his art. In 2006 he made a series of nine large landscapes of Woldgate Woods, returning to the same spot between March and November to chart the changing seasons. Each of these works consisted of up to six panels. On a trip to Los Angeles in February 2007, looking at images of his Woldgate Woods paintings, Hockney had the idea of working up the same scene over a much bigger scale. He had to work out how to complete this project without a ladder and in the small space of his studio in Bridlington. \\"The enormous 19th-century oil paintings like The Coronation of Napoleon in the Louvre were made in specially designed studios.\\" Because of space considerations, Hockney had to avoid working on a ladder or on scaffolding: \\"The trouble is that with something like this you need to step back. Artists have been killed stepping back from ladders.\\" \\"Then I realised it was possible to make a single picture that size,\\" he says, \\"using computer technology to help you see what you are doing. I thought, my God, it would be enormous, but that it would be good on the end wall of the largest gallery at the Royal Academy. I'd found a way to do an eye-catching landscape for the Summer Exhibition. It was quite a challenge.\\" Only six weeks after his idea in Los Angeles, the painting was completed. The first three weeks were spent organising the project, \\"The logistics were quite something.\\" His usual procedure when working in the landscape is to load a pickup truck with paints and materials and drive to the location. In addition, a special rack had to be constructed capable of storing 50 wet canvases. The painting itself was essentially completed in a three-week period in March 2007. \\"The painting had to be done in one go. Once I started, I had to carry on until it was finished,\\" says Hockney. \\"The deadline wasn't the Royal Academy. The deadline was the arrival of spring, which changes things. The motif is one thing in winter, but in summer it's one solid mass of foliage – so you can't see inside and it's not as interesting to me.\\" The solution was to sketch a grid showing how the scene would fit together over 50 panels. Each individual panel was painted in situ and as they were completed his assistant, Jean- Pierre Gonçalves de Lima, would digitally photograph them and then make them into a computer mosaic. With this mosaic he could chart his progress, since he could have only six panels on the wall at any one time. Gradually, with the help of the constantly updated computer mosaic, Hockney built up the picture. Hockney also spent time just looking at the subject he was going to paint. \\"I'd sit there for three hours at a time just looking, lying down practically so I looked up.\\" Showing Hockney produced Bigger Trees Near Warter for the Royal Academy summer exhibition in London, where it was first shown in May 2007, occupying the end wall of Gallery III. Following the close of the exhibition, once the rest of the works had been removed this painting remained in place. Two digital photographic renderings of the work on exactly the same scale as the original were then hung on the two walls flanking it. From 12 February 2011 to 12 June 2011, the painting was on display at York Art Gallery. From 25 June 2011 to 18 September 2011, the painting was on display at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. From 1 October 2011 to 4 March 2012, the painting was on display at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery in Bradford, the artist's birthplace. Donation In April 2008 Hockney donated the painting to the Tate, saying, \\"I thought if I'm going to give something to the Tate I want to give them something really good. It's going to be here for a while. I don't want to give things I'm not too proud of.\\" He also said, \\"I feel loyal to the Tate. More artists should donate. They should think about it. You can’t quite trust collectors who say they’ll give to the Tate and often don’t.\\" The Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, said, \\"It is an astonishing gift. Notwithstanding its size, this painting could have been sold to many buyers around the world. Simply to give with no tax benefit to himself is a remarkable gesture.\\" The painting found a permanent home at Tate Britain in November 2009, where it was displayed along with a pair of digital renderings of the painting. The copse can be found approximately 3/4 mile south of Warter. A group of trees near Warter which had been painted by Hockney was cut down in March 2009, but these were not the trees in the painting described in this article.

It was a considerably short period in the history of Polish literature marked by public fear caused by the gross abuses of power by state security forces. The policy was introduced during the Polish Writers Association's 4th Congress, which took place in Szczecin from 20th to 22 January 1949.Danuta Dąbrowska and Piotr Michałowski (eds), Presja i ekspresja. Zjazd szczeciński i socrealizm, Szczecin, Wyd. Uniwersytetu szczecińskiego, 2002. From this point until the end of Stalinism in the People's Republic, Socialist realism was an official cultural policy of the country. Writers and poets created works glorifying Joseph Stalin, the Communist doctrine, and the Polish United Workers' Party. Following Stalin's death, there were some critical opinions expressed about such literature, but Socialist realism was still being practised until the 1956 Polish October, when the policy was finally abandoned.Hubert Zawadzki, Jerzy Lukowski, A Concise History of Poland, Cambridge University Press, 2006, , Google Print, p.294-296 potato bug in Eastern Europe Authors During Stalinism there were no independent publishers or newspapers. Writers and poets had to write books compatible with the official doctrine or they were denied publication. There were some authors like Zbigniew HerbertJacek Trznadel, Hańba domowa, Warszawa 1986. who didn't want to glorify communism, so they were absent from cultural life. Others were blacklisted. But most of writers and poets obeyed the government's new cultural policies and were willing to describe the People's Republic of Poland as a land of happiness and freedom living under the benign dispensations of the Communist Party. There were two generations of authors. The first consisted of writers who had already made names for themselves before World War II, publishing books in the interwar period or during the war. Some of them were fascinated by the new order, and genuinely believed that communism would help the workers, the farmers and the poor. Because of that they joined the Polish United Workers' Party and became political activists like Leon Kruczkowski (playwright) who became a Member of Parliament, or the poet Julian Przyboś - who entered diplomatic service and was posted to Switzerland.Zbigniew Jarosiński, Nadwiślański socrealizm, Warszawa 1999. Those writers who cooperated with the government wielded a strong influence over the entirety of cultural life in Poland. One writer and publicist, Jerzy Putrament, was made a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in recognition of his loyalty to the communist cause. The second generation of writers was known as The Spotty-Faced (the origin of the nickname is a matter of dispute, with sources variously attributing its coinage to Julian Przyboś, Jan Kott or Zofia Nałkowska). Those were young authors convinced that communism was a fair social system who made their debuts believing that as writers and poets they should make all the people believe in the ideas of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Some of them, like Wiktor Woroszylski, Andrzej Braun and Witold Wirpsza, dominated literature and had a strong political impact locally, provoking a degree of anxiety in other writers because of their zeal and self-confidence. The Spotty-Faced\\" lost their influence after the Polish Thaw, and many slipped into literary oblivion. There was also a small group of writers which included famous authors and emerging names who refused to write socialist realistic novels, and chose to remain silent. They published their books after the end of Bierut's era. Zbigniew Herbert and Miron Białoszewski debuted in 1955, Jerzy Zawieyski, a Catholic writer and playwright (debuted in 1921) was denied publication. Such contrarian voices were often connected to the Catholic magazine Tygodnik Powszechny. Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia supported by the Resolution of Union of Polish Writers Factory literature Socialist realist writers aimed to portray ordinary people and their daily life. The plot of a typical socialist realist novel or short story was usually set in the workplace, so this kind of book is often referred to as \\"factory literature\\" (Polish: produkcyjniaki). Factories, coal mines, construction sites, small towns and villages were typical locations. Some novels depicted major communist construction projects like Nowa Huta: Janina Dziarnowska's Jesteśmy z Nowej Huty (We Are From Nowa Huta) or Początek opowieści (The Beginning of the Story) by Marian Brandys. The story of the social realist novel is schematic and uncomplicated. The establishing opening often shows a factory ruined by war, operated by disheartened and corrupt staff. The future is shrouded with a sense of gloom. The only upright, positive characters are the local activists from the Polish United Workers' Party, but even they find themselves unable to convince the workers of the advantages of the Six-Year Plan. There is always a positive character who tries to encourage the others to work better and to join the Party. He fails initially because of the machinations of the villain, but as time goes by the rest of the workforce is made to see the light and to embrace the ideas of the Six-Year Plan. The plant begins to prosper, and everyone's personal problems are also solved to arrive at the obligatory happy ending. A typical positive character wants to be a fine worker, perhaps even an udarnik. He is an idealist, a man of strong communist convictions who makes speeches in political rallies and spends a lot of time reading Marxist literature, especially Krótki kurs historii WKP(b) (A short story of All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)) and Stalin's Zagadnienia leninizmu (Questions of leninism). He could be an experienced worker who had long believed in communism, or a young men imbued with fresh enthusiasm for the new times. The protagonist is kind, intelligent, devoted to the Party, and always willing to help. The factory owes every improvement and invention to him. His greatest dream is to play his part in the victory of communism. At the end of a socialist realist novel his efforts find recognition and, if he was a bachelor, he finds a true love. The antagonist is a political adversary and a member of a hostile social class like the bourgeoisie. Never a mere criminal, he must be an actual enemy of the people. He could be a former (pre-war) police officer, a factory owner or a sanation political operative. In some novels he is a spy from the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany or France. The villain detests communism and hates the workers; he is typically a nasty, merciless piece of work, prepared to inflict unflinching harm on all around him, like committing acts of sabotage or conspiring against the hero. At the end of the novel he is unmasked (usually by the hero or by a member of the secret police) and imprisoned. There are also supporting characters, such as the local leader of the Party. He is often portrayed as a wise, righteous man, mentoring the young hero and acting as his patron. He gives warnings to his young friend about the conspiring enemies, and advises him to be always on guard against the lurking dangers of imperialist forces. Another typical character is an old worker, engineer or craftsman who remembers the pre-war days in Poland. He has no enthusiasm for communism, and even wants Poland to be liberated from the Soviet Union. Poetry Poetry was prized for its emotional potential to raise the flagging spirits and stir faith in the revolution. Socialist realist poetry focused on the beauty of the postwar world, the value of work and the general enthusiasm for the government. Socialist realist lyrics were similar to hymns and eulogies, and glorified factories, ships, coal and electricity. Especially noteworthy was the spate of lyrics on Joseph Stalin and other communist politicians. In Adam Ważyk's poem The River Stalin's wisdom is compared to a great river which circles the Earth, uniting people all over the world to bring them peace and joy. Władysław Broniewski wrote the lyric A few words about Stalin in which Stalin is described as the driver of \\"history's train\\". In 1955 poet Adam Ważyk (a member of the Polish United Workers' Party and a staunch supporter of Communism) published A Poem for Adults (\\"Poemat dla dorosłych\\"), which described postwar Poland in a critical way. Although Ważyk was a voice of Stalinism beforehand, he eventually rejected it, and criticised the results of it in the country, but only at the time of its impending disintegration. Ważyk was strongly criticised for this long poem which appeared in Nowa Kultura, an official publication of the Association of Polish Writers controlled by the Communists. It was a turning point in the wave of literary critiques of the Stalinist regime since 1956.

History  Ayat were formed in September 2000 by Filthy Fuck and Sadogoat.News, accessed on 23 June 2013. The line-up was completed by drummer Ayman in May 2001. In July 2001, Ayat recorded their first demo, Possession of Sister Clair. Two months later, the band gained \\"national notoriosity in unmusical ways and gains lots of fans who haven't even heard the Demo and lots of enemies and death threats\\". In September 2002, the second demo Al Nabi Mojrem Moghtaseib Dajjal was recorded. In November 2002, Ayman left the band; Ayat became inactive until June 2003, when they were reformed with Ayman and Tenebra's drummer Commander as session members. Ayman left the band a month later \\"in an uncourteous way which pisses off Ayat greatly\\", whereas Commander stayed in the band for a few more weeks before they stopped their activities again. The band got noticed through their demo and were offered interviews. In August 2003, Sadogoat was \\"called to defend his fucking country, which makes things worse and naturally slower\\". In January 2004, Commander was replaced by Haytham, and the band became active again. In May 2004, the band announced they had completed 12 songs for the new album, Kill, Fuck, Brothers, and Inhale for No Black Rain Shalt Hail, that was to be recorded during the summer. The album remained unreleased. The EP Al Nabi Moujrem, Moughtaseb, Dajjal was released through Sardonic Wrath Records in 2005. Their debut album Six Years of Dormant Hatred was released through Moribund Records in 2008. Ayat never played live, but Reverend Filthy Fuck once helped war metal band Damaar onstage.Diana Glöckner: Weltspiegel. Ayat. In: Metal Hammer, June 2009, p. 136. In 2010, the band announced they were currently recording their second album, Carry on, Carrion!.Main , accessed on 23 June 2013. However, it was only in November 2017 when this long-expected album was finally released.  Musical style and ideology  According to Moribund Records, the band's album \\"polarized critics as either 'genius' or 'garbage' but forcing an opinion out of everyone\\". Metal Hammer journalist Diana Glöckner called it \\"such an outstanding black metal album that they would have caused a stir even without their […] origin\\". On their homepage, the band stated that they support \\"the total annihilation of mankind, mistreatment of women, torture of those who deserve it, and supreme fucking mayhem across all nations, religions and races of the earth\\".Main, accessed on 23 June 2013. Asked about how his everyday life and the living conditions in Lebanon influenced the band's music and lyrics, Reverend Filthy Fuck replied that their music was only influenced by their everyday life, and that he was surprised when bands were not. \\"We are surrounded by drug abuse, prostitution, death, disease, war, love, religion every day—it would be weird not to deal with it.\\" According to him, Ayat never cared about censorship in Lebanon because they are an underground band and did not sell any album in Lebanon; \\"we corrupt the foreign youth, so it seems to be okay for our authorities\\". He sees the attention the band are getting due to their origin as an advantage, but also as a problem when they encounter racism (such as racist slurs) from Europeans.

His early descriptions and maps of the Birmingham District's unique coincidence of mineral resources for the making of steel opened the way for the early industrial development of the state.Smith, Eugene Allen (October 1897) \\"Sketch of the Life of Michael Tuomey\\". American Geologist. Vol. 20, p. 207Kidd, Jessica Fordham (November 9, 2009) \\"Michael Tuomey\\". Encyclopedia of Alabama - accessed November 17, 2010 Biography Michael was the son of Thomas and Nora (Foley) Tuomey of Cork, Ireland and was largely home-schooled in his youth. His natural talents as an observer combined with an interest in natural science led him to study biology. He taught schools in England before emigrating to Somerset County, Maryland in the early 1830s. He farmed and served as a private tutor for a while, then entered the Rensselaer Institute at Troy, New York in 1835. There he discovered the emerging scientific field of geology and, though he graduated from the institute that same year, made it his life's study.Johnson, Rossiter, editor (1904) The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans. Boston, Massachusetts: The Biographical Society Tuomey worked briefly as a field engineer for the railroads in North Carolina, then married the former Sarah E. Handy of Maryland in 1837 and returned to teaching, opening his own school in Petersburg, Virginia. On the recommendation of Sir Charles Lyell, he was appointed to succeed Edmund Ruffin as state geologist for South Carolina in 1844. After three years of work on that state's survey, he had become frustrated by the legislature's restrictions on his work. Lyell then recommended him to the state of Alabama where his interest in mineralogy rather than soils might be better rewarded. He still, however, emphasized the value of geological surveys to agriculture when making his reports. Tuomey came to Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1847, appointed a professor of geology, mineralogy and agricultural chemistry at the University of Alabama. He began his official surveys of the state's mineral resources, beginning with Red Mountain and Jones Valley in central Alabama, the next summer. His Geological Map of Alabama was printed in 1849 and his First Biennial Report of the Geology of Alabama was published by M. D. J. Slade in 1850. His report stated that: > It would be difficult to find a more striking illustration of the adaptation > of the earth's surface to man's wants, produced by the simplest possible > means. Had the underlying rocks remained in their original horizontal > positions, the whole country between the Coosa and Tombigby would have been > one monotonous sandstone plain. The coal would have been completely hidden, > and no one could have even conjectured the existence of the inexhaustible > beds of iron ore below the surface. But the simple pushing up of the > Silurian rocks has revealed all these, in the most effectual and interesting > manner, at the same time that it has intersected the coal measure with > valleys of great fertility. (quoted in Fazio, Michael W. (2010) Landscape of > Transformations: Architecture and Birmingham, Alabama. Knoxville, Tennessee: > University of Tennessee Press ) In addition to his official maps and reports, Tuomey contributed numerous articles to the scientific literature and provided reports on his discoveries to the press. He also collected mineral and fossil specimens to the Alabama Museum of Natural History, many of which were lost when the campus was burned by Wilson's Raiders at the conclusion of the American Civil War.Dean, Lewis S. (2001) The Papers of Michael Tuomey. Spartanburg, South Carolina: Reprint Company In 1854 Tuomey resigned his professorship to devote his full-time to the survey. He resumed teaching after his legislative appropriation expired in 1856. He was a member of the Boston Society of Natural History and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was listed as one of the subscribers to the 1853 book Types of Mankind.Types of Mankind (Philadelphia, 1853). His health failed in the Spring of 1857, and Mobile physician Josiah C. Nott diagnosed him with heart disease and pneumonia. He died on March 30, survived by his wife and two daughters, Margaret and Manora. His Second Biennial Report on the Geology of Alabama, edited by John Mallett, was published posthumously in 1858. He is buried in Tuscaloosa.

It developed, tested and produced solid rocket motors and propellant used in military and National Aeronautics and Space Administration applications. The site consists of approximately 400 acres which was leased from the City of Redlands. The predecessor Grand Central Rocket Company facility was used for the production, testing and disposal of solid rocket propellant used in rocket engines. Lockheed used the facility for research and for production of solid fuel rockets for military and commercial use until 1974. History The Lockheed Propulsion Company was founded in 1952 as the Grand Central Rocket Company by Major C. C. Moseley, co-founder of Western Airlines and Charles E. Bartley, the inventor of rubber-based solid rocket fuel propellants. The company announced on 22 December 1953, that a plant for manufacturing solid fuel rocket propellant would be built in the Redlands- Mentone area, and that negotiations with the Redlands City Council for 160 acres of city-owned land in East Lugonia were underway. The facility was expected to begin operation within 90 days. At the outset, 53 highly skilled technicians would be employed.Staff, \\"San Fernando Firm Will Build Plant to Produce Solid Fuel Propellants\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 23 December 1953, Volume LX, Number 98, page 19. In 1954, the company began operations at a 1,100 acre (?) site in the Mentone area. By 1956, the firm had 130 employees, and was expanding, said President Charles E. Bartley.Staff, \\"Redlands Firm to Make Rocket for Earth Satellite - Propellant Will Boost Sphere Into Its Orbit\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 6 April 1956, Volume LXII, Number 188, page 19. The U.S. Navy announced on 5 April 1956 that Grand Central Rocket Co. had been selected to build the solid-propellant third-stage rocket for Project Vanguard. Local residents reported explosions at the plant on occasion. One such case occurred at 6:55 p.m., according to the Redlands police, on 24 January 1957. The San Bernardino Sheriff's office stated that it was just another \\"prepared test explosion.\\" Company officials would not elaborate, saying only it was a controlled testing procedure.Staff, \\"Rocket Company Explosion Said 'Prepared Test'\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 25 January 1957, Volume LXIII, Number 126, page 11. The Redlands plant provided the ABL X-248 Altair third stage of the Vanguard 1 satellite launch vehicle in 1958. Vanguard 1 and this upper stage remain in orbit, making them the oldest still-in-orbit artificial satellites. Grand Central signed a contract to produce the solid rocket motor for the Project Mercury escape tower. This motor was ultimately produced by Lockheed when the Redlands plant was sold to Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Grand Central was acquired by Lockheed in February 1960 to become the Lockheed Propulsion Company as a research and production facility of solid fuel rockets and solid rocket propellant. On 8 September 1964, LPC President Robert F. Hurt launched a Zero Defects Program, aiming at a goal of defect-free performance in all phases of LPC operation. Representatives of Southern California firms supplying the company met at the Redlands headquarters on 16 September and were urged to pledge their support of the program. Copies of the Zero Defects Program were distributed to company representatives and were being sent to each of the company’s major suppliers across the country.Staff, “LPC Suppliers Support Zero Defects Plan,” The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 17 September 1964, Volume LXXI, Number 15, page C-4. Between 1966 and 1975, the Boeing Company sub-contracted with Lockheed Propulsion Company for propellants used in the AGM-69 short-range attack missile. For the Apollo program, Lockheed Propulsion Company provided both the Launch Escape Motor and the Pitch Control Motor of the emergency escape tower atop the Apollo command module, using propellant made of polysulfides. On 27 January 1972, the Marshall Spaceflight Center selected Aerojet-General, Lockheed Propulsion Company, Thiokol Chemical Company, and United Technology Center to study the use of 120-inch and 156-inch solid motors as part of the Space Shuttle booster package. Thiokol was ultimately selected as the solid rocket booster provider on 20 November 1973. In January 1974, Lockheed protested to the General Accounting Office (GAO) NASA's selection of Thiokol as designer of the SRB. Because of the protest, NASA issued Thiokol a 90-day study contract on 13 February so the firm could continue its work while GAO studied the situation. The study contract was extended again on 20 May for 45 days. In May 1975, NASA confirmed the Thiokol SRB contract. With the end of the Apollo project contracts, and no orders for the Space Shuttle program, as well as the conclusion of the AGM-69 SRAM project, Lockheed Propulsion Company was closed and sold in 1975. Environmental pollution \\"In the 1980s, trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent, was detected in four out of twelve groundwater wells sampled in the Redlands area. The Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management (DDW) within the California Department of Health Services CDHS, directed that any drinking water wells which contained TCE at levels exceeding 5 parts per billion (ppb) or the maximum contaminant level (MCL), be taken off-line. In 1989, as a result of the TCE contamination, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), Santa Ana Region, and the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) provided funding for the installation of a Liquid Phase Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) groundwater treatment system to treat and clean the water from the TCE impacted wells. Subsequent investigations by the CRWQCB determined that Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly Lockheed Propulsion Company) was the source of the TCE contamination. TCE had been the primary contaminant of concern emanating from the Lockheed site, until mid-1997 when the first tests for perchlorate in drinking water were performed.\\" In 1997, ammonium perchlorate was discovered in a number of domestic water supply wells that serve several water purveyors throughout San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Two of the wells in the City of Loma Linda's municipal drinking water system had been impacted by the perchlorate groundwater plume, originating from the Lockheed site. Perchlorate adversely affects human health by interfering with iodine uptake into the thyroid gland. In adults, the thyroid gland helps regulate the metabolism by releasing hormones, while in children, the thyroid helps in proper development. Some 800 residents in the Redlands community subsequently filed suit against Lockheed, alleging that the groundwater contamination had caused health problems. The California Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling in 2003, however, found that the citizens of Redlands, had no basis for filing a class action toxic tort lawsuit against the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The ruling in Carrillo v. Lockheed Martin both clarified the terms upon which mass medical tort claims may be filed, and debunked the increasingly common notion that \\"medical monitoring\\" is always a reasonable response when people are exposed to hazardous chemicals. Nonetheless, the Lockheed-Martin Corporation, successor to Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, has resisted efforts to make it pay for the clean-up of the contamination. Federal policies allowed for burning toxic chemical waste in open, unlined dirt pits during the 1970s, according to a lawsuit that Lockheed Martin Corp. filed against the U.S. government. Lockheed reported more than $500 million in liabilities companywide from \\"environmental matters,\\" which include soil and groundwater contamination in Redlands and unrelated projects, according to SEC filings. In a suit filed on 1 July 2008, the company wants the government to pay past cleanup costs and to be held liable for future expenses. A Lockheed spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in the District of Columbia. The lawsuit doesn't say how much money the company is seeking.

A scouring pad or scourer is a small pad of metal or plastic mesh used for scouring a surface. Some scouring pads have one side made of a soft sponge-like material and the other is the aforementioned mesh. History The scouring pad has been reincarnated in several forms over the years. In 1928, R. B. Kingman patented the scouring ball, which was one of the first scouring pads made of a metal mesh.Free Patents Online: Search results for \\"scouring pad\\" On 30 September 1941, United States patent 2,257,456 was issued to Joseph R. Crockford of Chicago, IL for a scouring device of the type employed for \\"cleansing and scouring pots, pans and other household implements.\\" The invention provided for a \\"plate of non-corrosive metal, arched or curved to fit the fingers.\\" In 1942, David J. Kelman patented a toroidal metal scouring pad. This was, and still is, used as an abrasive scrubbing pad, however, it is becoming less common, as it removes non-stick surfaces off pans. In 1988, the first scouring pad made of out sponge material was patented by Hans J. Hartmann. This enabled the scouring pad to float. To achieve this, he used a technique to thread the metal mesh through the sponge and wrap it around the outside. This was meant to stop the scouring pad from dropping to the bottom of the sink. In 1973, the plastic needle surface (now more commonly used) was invented by Edward Mednick, who invented the new surface as a way of reducing the damage scouring pads did to non-stick surfaces. This technology and varieties thereon are what most scouring pads sold today are based upon. Use Using scouring pads on non-stick surfaces such as Teflon is not advisable as they may strip away the coating. It is advisable to use protective equipment such as rubber gloves when using scouring pads as this is known to prevent (or at least hide) any irritation caused by use.

Parrish grew up in Utah and received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Weber State University in 1982. In 1985 she received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School. Parrish then served as a law clerk for David K. Winder of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Parrish also served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah from 1995 until her appointment to the Utah Supreme Court.  Early life  Parrish was born Jill Annette Niederhauser in Ogden, Utah, on August 16, 1961, the daughter of Ed and Beulah Niederhauser. She lived in Ogden until she left for law school in 1982. Parrish graduated from Ogden High School in 1979. She attended Weber State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Political Science in 1982. She attended Yale Law School, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 1985. During her time at Yale, Parrish was on the Yale Moot Court Team.  Early legal career  After graduating from law school, Parrish served as a law clerk to the late David K. Winder of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Upon completion of her clerkship in 1986 she joined the Salt Lake City law firm of Parr, Waddoups, Brown, Gee & Loveless as an associate. She became a shareholder at the firm in 1990. During her time at Parr, Waddoups, Parrish’s focus was on commercial litigation. One high-profile case was Gold Standard, Inc. v. Getty Oil Co., 915 P.2d 1060, (Utah 1996). Gold Standard, Inc and Getty Oil Co. entered into a joint mining venture. When Gold Standard failed to fund its portion in the venture, Getty Oil reduced its share. Gold Standard sued Getty Oil claiming wrongful conversion, breach of contract and fraud. Parrish represented the defendant, Getty Oil Co. The trial court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Getty Oil Co. The Utah Supreme court affirmed the trial court's partial summary judgment in 1996. From 1995 to 2003, Parrish served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah, where she supervised the Financial Litigation unit. Parrish started at the United States Attorney’s office during Scott M. Matheson’s tenure as the United States Attorney. While at the U.S. Attorney’s office, Parrish worked on cases involving Revised Statute 2477SUWA. (commonly known as, RS 2477.) In the Civil division, Parrish also represented the United States in torts and in environmental and employment cases. RS 2477 became a law shortly after the American Civil War as part of the Mining act of 1866. The law states that \\"the right-of-way for the construction of highways across public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.\\" RS 2477 was repealed by the United States Congress in 1976, but any existing rights- of-way were protected as long as they were in compliance with the statute. Controversy arose in the 1980s when several Utah officials argued that passage of a vehicle alone amounted to construction of a highway. This would give right of way for construction of a highway on any one of the numerous dirt trails and tracks throughout Southern Utah. This brought controversy because the construction of highways on these trails allegedly would be devastating to Utah wildlife. Parrish was involved in the lengthy litigation process that involved these roads in Southern Utah. The laws regarding RS 2477 claims are still not well defined and continue to stir up controversy.  Judicial career  Parrish was appointed to the Utah Supreme Court in January 2003, by Governor Michael Leavitt, following the retirement of Justice Richard C. Howe.Elizabeth Neff, \\"Senate OKs Two Supreme Court Justices\\", Salt Lake Tribune, February 27, 2003). Parrish served as chair of both the Supreme Court Committee on Civility and Professionalism and the State Law Library Oversight Committee. She was a member of the Court Technology Committee until October 2010. She is a past president of the Utah Chapter of the Federal Bar Association and formerly served as the State Court Liaison to that organization. Parrish served as the Supreme Court representative on the Utah Judicial Council. =Federal judicial service= On September 18, 2014, President Obama nominated Parrish to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, to the seat vacated by Judge Dee Benson, who took senior status on January 1, 2014. On December 16, 2014 her nomination was returned to the President due to the sine die adjournment of the 113th Congress. On January 7, 2015, President Obama renominated her to the same position. She received a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on January 21, 2015. On February 26, 2015 her nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On May 21, 2015 the U.S. Senate voted 100–0 in favor of final confirmation. She received her judicial commission on August 17, 2015. A formal investiture for Parrish was held on November 23, 2015.  Selected opinions  = Utah Department of Transportation v. G. Kay, Inc. = On September 26, 2003, Justice Parrish authored her first opinion for the Utah Supreme court in the case of Utah Department of Transportation v. G. Kay, Inc. 78 P.3d 612 (Utah 2003). In this case, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) condemned property owned by G. Kay, Inc. to make the Legacy Nature Preserve, a 2,100 acre area that was to be set aside to mitigate the environmental impacts of the construction of the proposed Legacy highway. When UDOT moved to condemn the land owned by G. Kay, Inc., G. Kay moved to dismiss UDOT’s complaint, because they did not have the authority to condemn its property. The court affirmed that UDOT did have the authority to condemn the property to mitigate the environmental impact of the construction of the Legacy Parkway Project (Legacy Highway.) Chief Justice Durham, Associate Chief Justice Durrant, Justice Wilkins, and Judge Nehring concurred in Justice Parrish's opinion. = State v. Jeffs = State v. Jeffs, ( No. 20080408, Filed July 27, 2010, 2010 UT 49). The state of Utah charged Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS) leader Warren Jeffs with two counts of rape as an accomplice against Elissa Wall. Wall was a student at Alta Academy, an FLDS school where Jeffs was both a teacher and the principal. Wall had been taught by Jeffs, both in school and in church, that to disobey his teachings or those of his counselors was to be denied spiritual salvation. Jeffs’ two rape charges were the result of sexual intercourse that ensued between Elissa Wall, who was 14 at the time, and her 19-year-old cousin, Allen Steed, after Jeffs allegedly forced Wall to marry Steed. Jeffs was convicted after a jury trial in 2007 and sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life. Jeffs raised seven issues that he thought invalidated the jury verdict. On July 27, 2010, the Utah Supreme court reversed Jeffs’ two convictions of rape and remanded for a new trial on the grounds that \\"the trial court’s instructions to the jury regarding lack of consent were in error.\\" Justice Parrish authored the court’s decision with Chief Justice Durham, Associate Chief Justice Durrant, and Justice Nehring in concurrence. Justice Parrish wrote in the conclusion of the court’s decision that \\"We regret the effect our opinion today may have on the victim of the underlying crime, to whom we do not wish to cause additional pain. However, we must ensure that the laws are applied evenly and appropriately.\\" = State v. Willis = In State v. Willis 100 P.3d 1218 (Utah, 2006) The defendant, Wade Willis challenged the constitutionality of the Utah code that prohibits certain \\"restricted persons\\" including those who are on probation for a felony, from possessing firearms. Willis, who was on probation for a third degree felony, was found in possession of a nine-millimeter handgun. Willis was charged with a second degree felony under Utah Code section 76-10-503(2)(a) which prohibits convicted felons from possessing a firearm. Willis argues that this violates his right to bear arms, a right guaranteed by the Utah constitution (Article 1, Section 6.) Justice Parrish and the court in a unanimous opinion, rejected his argument. Parrish stated \\"that there is no evidence in the legislative history to suggest the existence of an intent to extend the right of gun possession to felons.\\" = American Bush v. City of South Salt Lake = In American Bush v. City of South Salt Lake, 140\\\\. P.3d 1235 (Utah 2006). the City of South Salt Lake passed an ordinance that prohibited sexually oriented business employees from \\"[a]ppear[ing] in a state of nudity before a patron on the premises of a sexually oriented business.\\" American Bush, Paradise Modeling and Leather and Lace filed an action in state court claiming that this ordinance violated their free speech rights as defined by the Utah State Constitution. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the City of South Salt lake, stating that the right to \\"communicate freely their thoughts and opinions\\" did not extend to nude dancing in sexually oriented businesses. Justice Parrish, with Associate Chief Justice Wilkins and Justice Durrant in concurrence, affirmed the court’s summary judgment. = University of Utah v. Shurtleff = University of Utah v. Shurtleff 144 P.3d 1109 (Utah, 2006). Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff issued Opinion No. 01-002, which claimed that the University’s policy prohibiting firearms on campus violated Utah’s Uniform Firearms Act, The University sued the Attorney general for a declaratory judgement claiming that, under Article X, Section 4 of the Utah Constitution, they could disregard Utah Law when it interfered with academic affairs. During the appeals process, Utah Legislature passed section 63-98-102, which prohibits state and local entities from enforcing policies that inhibit the possession of firearms on public or private property. Justice Parrish with Associate Chief Justice Wilkins, Justice Durrant, and Justice Nehring in concurrence gave the opinion that the University of Utah did not have the power to disregard Utah Law. Chief Justice Durham dissented.  Public speeches  On October 12, 2005, Justice Parrish delivered a speech at the Admissions Ceremony for new inductees to the Utah State Bar that was published in the Utah Bar Journal in its January/February 2006 issue. In her speech Lessons From Kindergarten, Justice Parrish advises that to achieve success in the legal profession, you need more than just knowledge of the law. You need \\"those other characteristics and qualities that you bring to bear in your professional life- the really important things, the lessons you learned in Kindergarten.\\" Parrish advised new lawyers to share, play fair, practice with professionalism and civility, be responsible and work hard, and maintain a sense of perspective.  Personal life  Parrish is married to attorney Blake Parrish. Together, they have five children.

The game includes some elements from point-and-click adventure games. The game was re-released on Steam in 2014. Plot The world of Clans is populated by four different clans, that of humans, barbarians, elves, and dwarfs. Once, they were put in a state of war by an evil demon, who was, however, later imprisoned, thus stopping the massacre. Now, the demon woke up again in his prison, which is now populated by his minions. Player, taking the role of one of the best warriors of the four clans, has to enter the demon's domain, making his way to the demon himself. The game concludes with the player killing the demon. Gameplay The game is similar in both basic gameplay and visuals to Diablo series. However, there is no leveling system, meaning that the only way to increase player's attributes is by collecting rings, drinking special stat-raising potions, and simply using more powerful weapons and better armour. Four classes are available to play: warrior, barbarian, dwarf, and elf, all with the same abilities, but each especially good at one. Clans is split into seven stages, with the seventh being mostly the boss stage. Each stage is divided into many sectors, or \\"rooms\\", that player visits. During the game, the player is often tasked with solving a riddle or puzzle, or helping a friendly character. Also present are point-and-click graphic games elements, such as inventory, an ability to use items with objects or characters. While there is no town in-game, the player encounters several quest-giving or simply aiding characters (like wizard, old woman, blacksmith, chef, witch, cursed warrior) and a trader along the way. Some of the main characters' quotes are presented in a humorous style. The player can find and equip 5 attribute- boosting rings, and use swords, axes, shields, and armor of five types each (though there are only four axes). The main point of gameplay is navigate through the stage, finding better equipment and health potions in order to cure the wounds received from monsters, which ranges from the weak goblin-like humanoids and trolls to the most dangerous black mages and knights. Notes Some of the game's aspects are based on Dungeons & Dragons RPG. The player can randomize a character's stats, with an animation of throwing dice, which results in on-screen calculations (3d6) similar to ones known from D&D.; Every better weapon has a +1 in its name, with the best being +5. Also, the second stage, which is lava-filled dungeon, is named Underdark, after the famous setting.

The related term Thraco- Dacology also exists, alluding to Thraco-Dacian, and one of the first uses is also from around 1980, in the Romanian government archive. The term Dacologist has been negatively affected by the association with Protochronism. Some researchers prefer to call themselves Thracologists instead of Dacologists. This choice of title is made in the context of their research being focused on the Dacians and without necessarily promoting a strong connection between the Thracians and Dacians.

Chemigrams were invented in the 1950s by Belgian artist Pierre Cordier. History Johann Schulze is regarded as the first to obtain a chemigram-like image; in 1725, he produced such a work using opaque paper and a bottle of silver salts. Hippolyte Bayard produced another chemigram-like image during sensitization tests he conducted in 1839. In the 1930s and 1940s, the German Edmund Kesting and the French Maurice Tabard produced pictures by painting with developer and fixer on photographic paper. It is the Belgian artist Pierre Cordier (born 1933), however, who has been most responsible for developing and exploring chemigrams. From his early days, in 1956, he was one of its rare practitioners, and contributed to its development by expanding its technical and esthetic possibilities. He adopted the name chimigramme in French in 1958 (chemigram in English and Dutch, Chemigramm in German, chimigramma in Italian, and quimigrama in Spanish and Portuguese), the most widely accepted designation today. In 1974 Josef H. Neumann advanced the process in his chemograms by incorporating optical elements before applying chemicals.Gabriele Richter: Joseph H. Neumann. Chemogramme. in: Color Foto. Heft 12, 1976, p. 24. Process First page of the Bayard album, photosensitization test, 1839, collection of the Société française de photographie. A chemigram is made by painting with chemicals on photographic paper and lies within the general domain of experimentation in the visual arts. It requires the use of materials from silver halide-based photography (light-sensitive paper, developer, and fixer), but it is not a photograph. Like the photogram, the chemigram is made without a camera, yet it is created in full light instead of in the darkness of the darkroom. For this reason it is not \\"light that writes\\" (photo graphein in the Greek) but rather \\"chemistry that writes\\". Chemigrams can be made solely with photo paper, developer, and fixer, with results that will somewhat resemble watercolor. The possibilities can be multiplied by using materials from painting (such as varnish, wax, or oil), These kinds of experiments are akin to those of Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Antoni Tàpies. Unlike chemigrams the production process of chemograms consists of two different steps. First an enlarger is used to partly or fully process a photographic image onto photographic paper in the darkroom and thereafter the chemicals are applied in full light.

This accounts for more than 62% of the Say Yes cohort, while 26% of the students in classes preceding the group and 28% of students following the group completed high school. 44 of these 70 students pursued a post-secondary education, with 21 completing bachelor's degrees, 9 receiving associate's degrees, and 14 earning trade certificates. 34 of the original 112 students dropped out of school, and 8 students died, all but one in a violent manner. Of the 76 students in the Hartford Chapter, 79% received a high school diploma or GED. Those students went on to complete 11 trade certificates, 7 associate's degrees, 20 bachelor's degrees, and 4 master's degrees. From the Cambridge Chapter, 87% of the original 69 students completed high school, with 72% of those graduates completing a post-secondary education. Some of the criticism directed at Say Yes has been that while the program \\"might have been a noble experiment that changed lives, its results have not approached its cost.\\" Others have argued that young, at-risk students promised a free post- secondary education \\"could not begin to comprehend how they were supposed to use the 'abstract' gift to graduate from college.\\"Smith, Janell \\"Review\\" , Penn GSE Perspectives on Urban Education, Vol. 5, Issue 1: Teaching for Social Justice, Fall 2007, accessed December 5, 2010.

Initially believed to be some sort of carrion-eating eagle, it was for some time placed in the distinct genus Wetmoregyps, named for Alexander Wetmore. It probably resembled a larger version of the modern-day savanna hawk, with its long legs possibly used like the secretarybird of Africa to hunt for small reptiles from a safe distance. It died out about 13,000 years ago. Fossils of B. daggetti were discovered in the La Brea and Carpinteria lagerstätte in southern California, and in Nuevo León in Mexico. Its habitat included grasslands, marshlands, brushy savannas and ponds. It probably ate mostly small reptiles such as snakes. As is often the case with birds, the female seems to have been larger than the male. Description A savanna hawk, in the same genus and thought to be similar in appearance In life, B. daggetti is thought to have resembled the related savanna hawk, also of the genus Buteogallus: B. daggetti had long legs which earned it the nickname \\"walking eagle\\". Miller (1915) concluded that these legs had little lifting power and weakly grasping claws compared to eagles that hunt on the wing. Conversely, the points of strong muscle attachment on the shaft of the tarsus suggest walking proficiency. He likened this \\"degeneracy\\" to the relationship of the roadrunner to tree-dwelling cuckoos. As with many birds, its females were larger than the males, an example of sexual dimorphism. However, it is some 40 percent larger than the savanna hawk. This gives it a total length of , including of tail; its wingspan would have been . Body weight is estimated at . This makes it quite a heavy raptor, slightly greater than the present-day secretarybird of Africa. This African raptor shares the long legs of B. daggetti and their lifestyles may have been similar (see \\"Ecology\\" below). Comparison of Buteogallus tibiotarsi History Comparison of B. daggetti and great blue heron tarsometatarsi Buteogallus daggetti was first described by Loye Holmes Miller in 1915 as Morphnus daggetti, from a tarsometatarsus found in the La Brea Tar Pits. The bone's great length, comparable to a great blue heron's, gave him the impression of an \\"eagle on stilts\\" and led to comparisons with the secretarybird. The specific name pays tribute to F.S. Daggett of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (at the time the Museum of History, Science, and Art). By 1925, Miller had assigned three more tarsometatarsi and an incomplete tibiotarsus to the genus. In 1932, Hildegarde Howard assigned a coracoid and (tentatively) some phalanges to Wetmoregyps from specimens at the tar pits. She noted these fossils were difficult to distinguish from those of Woodward's eagle (Buteogallus woodwardi), a huge bird of prey in the same genus as the savanna hawk. In 1928 and 1931, having obtained more fragmentary tarsometarsi from the Carpinteria asphalt, he reexamined his conclusions and found the bird more similar to Caracara and the great black hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga). He nevertheless assigned it to the new genus Wetmoregyps, possibly because it was much bigger than those aforementioned birds. In 1943 Miller wrote on two coracoids and a tarsometatarsus from San Josecito Cavern in Nuevo León, Mexico. Storrs L. Olson studied the bird in 2007 and placed it in the genus Buteogallus owing to its similarity to the savanna hawk. Behavior and ecology B. daggetti may have lived like the modern-day secretarybird. Buteogallus daggetti habitats comprised open grasslands, marshlands, and savannas from sea level to . Because of its large size and long legs, B. daggetti is theorized to have lived rather like the modern-day secretarybird. Its diet would have been composed mostly of snakes and other small reptiles, which it would have kicked to death with its long legs. Not just good weapons, these legs would have kept the bird at a safe distance from its struggling prey. Olson's paper guessed that B. daggetti may have been attracted to grass fires as the savanna hawk is today. These fires chase out small animals, which then make easy prey for the raptors. Olson disputes claims that B. daggetti was primarily a scavenger, and that its extinction was somehow linked to the decline of the North American Pleistocene megafauna. He likewise found Miller's vision of the bird as a forest-dweller \\"spurious\\".

Talent pipelines consist of potential employees who are interested in working at a given employer, but are not ready to apply. This group is engaged with on a frequent basis so that when the potential employees are ready to seek a new job, they have a relationship with the company.  Job Seeker's Perspective  A job seeker joins a talent community when they hear about a company, are interested, but not quite ready to apply. For example, Mary hears about Acme Corp from recent PR surrounding Acme's latest product enhancement. She goes to the company's career website, and perhaps looks at a microsite related to the job family she is interested in. After reading about working at the company, Mary is intrigued. But, she doesn't have a resume since she's worked happily at the same company for the past five years. So, she simply leaves her name and email in Acme's talent community. She'll now get updates from the company that are relevant to her - interview tips, career paths of similar professionals, information on events that Acme is holding, etc. When Mary is ready to move on from her current job, Acme is now top of mind. She has an increased chance of applying to this company because of the relationship she's built by consuming this content since joining the talent community.  Relating Talent Communities to Sales and Marketing  This concept is best described through analogues with sales and marketing. Let's say a consumer goes to a website to make a purchasing decision, like buying a new car. They read about the new sedan being offered by a car company, and are very interested in purchasing it. But, something is stopping them from buying it today. Maybe their lease isn't up for another 6 months, or they won't have the proper funds until they get a new job. So, they sign up for the company's email list to get updates on the car. In 6 months when they are ready to make a purchasing decision, this car is top of mind after having received updates for months prior via the car company's email list. This email list is very analogous to the employer's talent community which is keeping passive job seekers in the loop until they are ready to make their own \\"purchasing decision\\" and apply for a job.  Job Seeker Interactions Through Talent Communities  Job seekers can expect to get insights into the culture of a given company through the talent community. The most common delivery mechanism is email. Companies can also use text messages, online and offline events, and phone conversations to engage candidates.  Execution of Talent Communities  Talent communities can be executed in a variety of ways depending on a company's size and goals. For the smallest of companies, a simple spreadsheet of interested candidates may be all that is needed. For larger companies, it makes sense to have a dedicated software vendor focused on talent communities such as XOR, Smashfly, Avature, Yello, Fuseology, or NextWave Hire. Companies with internal engineering resources can also get creative by constructing their own solutions by using APIs like Twilio, Sendgrid, etc. as well as existing off the shelf marketing technologies like Marketo. The best talent communities have an automated passive strategy to nurture candidates, such as email campaigns. They also have a more active strategy for engaging the most relevant candidates, such as recruiters actively sourcing within these pools.  Return On Investment  The value for employers is in decreasing their time to fill and cost per hire. This is accomplished in several ways. First off, the majority of job seekers in a talent community would've never applied via the ATS. That is why they are entering the talent community in the first place. So, the talent community gives the HR teams incremental applicants that are thinking long term about their careers, and thus higher quality than the average candidate. Moreover, having a warm pipeline of talent means that corporate recruiters don't have to spend time reaching out cold through LinkedIn, or hoping the right person will apply through a job posting. They have a database of relevant job seekers that they can email which brings their time to value down when filling a new job. The benefits have been similarly stated as:\\"Beyond Talent Pools: Building Dynamic Communities\\" by Kevin Wheeler qualified candidates at a recruiter's fingertips; less dependence on ineffective job boards (also known as employment websites); less money spent on job advertisements; increased interaction with potential candidates; better quality of applicants to job openings; creation of a talent pipeline for future job openings; and, attraction of passive candidates  Talent Pool vs. CRM vs. Talent Pipeline vs. Talent Community  While there are differences across these various terms, in reality they are used mostly interchangeably within the HR and Talent Acquisition communities. A talent pool is a database of everyone that has ever applied to a recruiter's jobs, regardless of relevance.Talent Community or Applicant Database by Kevin Wheeler It is typically a one way communication, whereas a talent community will have more two way communication between recruiters/employers and talent - both active and passive job seekers. A Candidate Relationship Management (CRM) is similar to a sales team's Customer Relationship Management software. However, while sales tools like Salesforce have been around for decades, CRMs for talent management are relatively new for corporate HR teams. This translates to less functionality relative to the analogous sales software. There is also much lower usage of these tools because they are so new. The vast majority of HR teams are not used to using a CRM, and so many of these systems go unused at companies that have them. Instead, internal recruiting teams are using existing tools like Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), LinkedIn, etc. to manage their relationships with candidates. The idea of a Talent Pipeline is an abstract notion of having warm relationships with relevant groups of potential applicants. These pipelines can be managed via a talent community, CRM, or even a spreadsheet in very simple cases.  Common Pitfalls of Talent Communities  Many employers mis-step in their execution of talent communities. First, the majority of companies never engage with their talent community members given the lack of marketing DNA within the HR function. It becomes overwhelming for most companies to write relevant emails to each segment within their talent community on a regular (weekly or monthly) basis. Second, many companies will send job openings to their talent communities. However, the members of these communities have explicitly decided to sign up for the talent community in lieu of applying for a job and are much more interested in information regarding company culture or professional development. Last, companies do not proactively engage with the most relevant people who may be a good fit for an open role and are much more prone to take a passive strategy.

The site is managed by the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and gained its SSSI status in 1968, and in 2005 it was designated a Special Area of Conservation. Location and natural features Ford Moss is bound to the south by the high Goatscrag Hill and the west by the Blackchester Hill, both of which are sandstone formations. It is one of two SSSIs located on the Ford & Etal estate which were originally two separate estates combined in 1908 when James Joicey, 1st Baron Joicey purchased them both. Access can be gained by heading south off the B6353 (vehicles must be left at the gate of the site) and although there are a some good footpaths for the general public, permits are required to enter certain parts. The 71.6 hectare site, situated around above sea level, is made up partly (46 hectares) of a raised bog of peat, which is up to deep in places and underlain by carboniferous limestone some 363 to 325 million years ago. The bog, or mire, was a rainfed lake at some point in its history of which the build up of vegetation outstripped that of decomposition, giving it its 'raised' aspect. A report to the Government Office of the North East (GONE) stated that \\"although partly drained, the re- wetted surface contains many waterlogged areas,\\" that \\"the water table should normally be within 25cm of the surface\\" and that the water quality was \\"good.\\"The 2006 report prepared by Treweek Environmental Consultants Flora include heather, cotton grass, hares tail and cross-leaved heath and fauna to be found are red squirrels, roe deer, curlew, red grouse and adders amongst others. The first Northumberian sightings of the solitary bee \\"Colletes succinctus\\" were made around the bog in 2007. To the south of the bog is found ancient woodland containing Scots Pine, birch and willow trees. Man-made features There is some evidence that a deserted village from the medieval age existed on the site although information is difficult to find about it. On the western edge of the site are located the remains of a colliery which was in use from at least the late 17th century to the outbreak of World War I. The colliery supplied local businesses, such as a brick and tileworks at Flodden and Ford Forge. A small collection of houses surrounded the colliery and there was even a railway proposed in 1852 which was however never built.Information from the Durham Mining Museum site Despite not falling out of use until reasonably recently there is very little evidence of it to be found except for engine house walls, the bases of some of the miners' cottages, and an engine house chimney, Grade II listed in 1988 and described as \\"Mid C19.

Demain (April 26, 1927 - April 3, 2020) was an American microbiologist. During a 60-year career, he gained a reputation in the field of industrial microbiology. He was the Professor of Industrial Microbiology in the Biology Department at MIT and Founder and Head of Department of Fermentation Microbiology at Merck & Co. The August 2010 edition of The Journal of Antibiotics celebrated his scientific career.http://www.nature.com/ja/focus/dr_arnold_demain/index.html Demain was described as “one of the world’s leading industrial microbiologists” and as “a scientist constantly in the forefront of industrial microbiology and biotechnology.” He was “a pioneer in research on the elucidation and regulation of the biosynthetic pathways leading to the penicillins and cephalosporins” and \\"instrumental in the development of the beta-lactam industry\\". One feature of Demain's work, according to Microbiology Australia, was his “ability to undertake fundamental research on systems with clear industrial applications, recognising that biodiscovery is the start of the road that includes strain improvement to achieve levels of product synthesis that warrant further investment to take products into the marketplace.” Demain published over 500 papers, co-edited or co-authored fourteen books, and took out 21 U.S. patents. Early life and education Demain was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 26, 1927. His grandparents were all immigrants from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. As a boy he worked delivering groceries and was also a stock boy at Lord & Taylor’s department store in Manhattan. Demain's father, Henry, was in the pickle manufacturing business, managing a canning and pickling plant for Vita Foods Corp. in Chestertown, Maryland. Demain's uncles Ben and Seymour operated another pickling factory, Demain Foods Co., in Ayden, North Carolina. According to one source, “Henry was a leader in the pickle business, working for Fields and then Bloch and Guggenheimer in New York before setting up the pickle plant in Chestertown.” Demain himself said that his grandfather, Joseph Demain, “had sold pickles for years in one of New York’s major market areas.” Demain attended five different public elementary schools and three different public high schools in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and graduated high school at age 16. Demain attended Michigan State briefly, then joined the U.S. Navy in 1945 and spent two years in Philadelphia caring for amputees who were members of the armed forces who had been injured in the war. Demain returned to Michigan State in 1947, earning B.S. and M.S. degrees in bacteriology from the Department of Microbiology and Public Health in 1949 and 1950 respectively. His master's research topic was the spoilage and softening of pickles during fermentation, a phenomenon that, he concluded, was probably caused by pectic enzymes. At MSC Demain met and married a fellow student, Joanna (“Jody”) Kaye from Youngstown, Ohio. From MSC, Demain went to the University of California's Department of Food Science, which was first at the Berkeley campus and then at Davis. He began work on his Ph.D. project on polygalacturonase of Saccharomyces fragilis. The project resulted in four papers on pectic enzymes, one of which published in Nature. At Berkeley, he was in charge of the cultures in UC's yeast collection. Demain said that he and Phaff “apparently were the first in the world to carry out affinity chromatography, using a pectic acid gel to selectively adsorb YPG from culture filtrates.” Demain received his Ph.D. in 1954. Career In early 1954, Demain moved to Danville, Pennsylvania, where he worked as a research microbiologist for Merck Sharp & Dohme, studying the synthesis of penicillin. His work helped identify the amino acids that form the nucleus of penicillin, established the mechanisms that enable primary metabolites and carbon sources to regulate secondary metabolite synthesis, and demonstrated that penicillin was the product of synthesis and inactivation during fermentation. In late 1955, Demain moved on to Merck's penicillin research laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, where he worked on fermentation microbiology, â-lactam antibiotics, flavor nucleotides, and microbial nutrition. In 1964 when he was asked to form a new department at Merck that would involve the improvement of product biosynthesis in microbial strains. Demain named it the Department of Fermentation Microbiology Demain “directed research and development on processes for monosodium glutamate, vitamin B12, streptomycin, riboflavin, cephamycin, fosfomycin, and interferon inducers,” and “elucidated the mechanism by which the biosynthesis of cephalosporin in Cephalsporium acremonium was stimulated by the presence of methionine – a new mechanism which had not been reported before.” The team managed to boost production yields of vitamin B12. The work done under Demain's direction in Rahway has been described in Microbiology Australia as “remarkable” in its “level of innovation,” in that it identified “novel biochemical pathways” that improved “natural levels of production” several thousandfold. In 1968, Demain was invited by Nevin Scrimshaw, head of the Department of Nutrition and Food Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to become a full professor at that university. The next year Demain became Professor of Industrial Microbiology in Scrimshaw's department at MIT and set up a fermentation microbiology laboratory there. Demain stayed at MIT for the next 32 years. In 1970, Demain went to Prague to present the closing Plenary Session address at the first Genetics of Industrial Microorganisms Symposium. He spoke on the “marriage of genetics and industrial microbiology.” At MIT, Demain and his team pioneered research on the elucidation and regulation of the biosynthetic pathways leading to penicillins and cephalosporins. Demain's MIT research led to “a breakthrough discovery of a key enzyme in cephalosporin biosynthesis –deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase ('expandase'). The discovery of this enzyme established the role of penicillin as an intermediate in cephalosporin C biosynthesis and disproved the previous hypothesis that these two separate end products of C. acremonium were formed by a branched secondary metabolic pathway.” In the mid-1990s, Demain and his team “started a series of NASA-sponsored experiments to determine the effect of simulated microgravity (SMG) on secondary metabolism” and “found that regulation of microbial processes under SMG was quite different from that at normal gravity.” In his last MIT projects he studied Clostridium tetani and C. difficile with the aim of facilitating the production of improved tetanus and antibiotic-associated diarrhea vaccines. The effort was successful. Summing up his years at MIT, Demain later said that he “was very lucky...to have had a fantastic group of bright and hardworking visiting scientists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students. I owe all my success to them and my two amazing lab supervisors, Nadine A. Solomon and Aiqi Fang....Success at MIT would not have been possible without them.” Demain has said that “the explosion of the biotechnology field” in the early 1970s led to his involvement with “the first biotechnology company, the Cetus Corporation, in Berkeley in 1971.” Demain became an advisor to Cetus. In 2001, Demain became one of a small group of Research Fellows pwcat the Charles Dana Research Institute for Scientists Emeriti, or RISE, at Drew University in New Jersey. In this capacity he trained undergraduate students in conducting research in microbial chemistry. Other professional activities Demain was elected president of the Society for Industrial Microbiology in 1990, and became a member of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) in 1994, the Mexican Academy of Sciences in 1997, and the Hungarian Academy of Science in 2002. He was on the Board of Governors of the American Academy of Microbiology, has served as a member of the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Microbiological Sciences (IUMS), and was a delegate to the 2002 General Assembly in Paris. He has been honorary consultant for the Fujian Institute of Microbiology and the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry in The People’s Republic of China. In addition, he was a member of the scientific advisory boards of Tetravitae Bioscience and of Dyadic International, and was also on the advisory board of Codexis, Inc. Honors and awards Demain has received honorary doctorates from the University of Leon (Spain), Ghent University (Belgium), Technion (Israel), Michigan State, and University of Münster (Germany). The August 2010 special issue of The Journal of Antibiotics celebrated Demain's career, noting that he had “established and maintained a renowned reputation within the field of industrial microbiology.” Personal life Arny Demain was married to Joanna (Kaye) Demain for 68 years; they had two children. He died from complications of COVID-19.

In the British Isles it is a bread which dates back to the Iron Age. Today, it is commonly blended (in a smaller proportion) with wheat to make conventional breadmaking flour. Religious references A loaf of barley bread features in a dream mentioned in : a Midianite man dreamt that \\"a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent collapsed\\"; Israelite leader Gideon overheard an account of the dream and concluded that he was assured of victory over the Midianites. Loaves made of barley feature in the story of the feeding of the 5000 in John's Gospel in the New Testament (). It is often mentioned in Islamic sources as a commoner's food in comparison with wheat bread, perceived as a sort of luxury item. In the Muwatta Imam Malik (hadith 1700) it is narrated that Jesus the son of Mary used to say, \\"O Bani Israil! You must drink pure water and the green things of the land and barley bread. Beware of wheat bread, for you will not be grateful enough for it.\\" Another narration from Sahih Bukhari (5413) gives a detailed comparison between sifted, fine flour and unsifted flour for making barley bread: I asked Sahl bin Sa\`d, \\"Did Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ever eat white flour?\\" Sahl said, \\"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never saw white flour since Allah sent him as an Apostle till He took him unto Him.\\" I asked, \\"Did the people have (use) sieves during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\\" Sahl said, \\"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never saw (used) a sieve since Allah sent him as a prophet until He took him unto Him,\\" I said, \\"How could you eat barley unsifted?\\" he said, \\"We used to grind it and then blow off its husk, and after the husk flew away, we used to prepare the dough (bake) and eat it.\\" See also *Balep korkun *Bannock *Chalboribbang, a Korean barley pancake or \\"sticky barley bread\\" *Gyabrag, a Tibetan barley pancake *Malt loaf *Rye bread References External links *Ancient barley bread Category:Barley Category:Barley-based dishes ","title":"Barley bread"},{"id":"29643438","text":"John B Mather (c. 1845 - 31 January 1892) was the son of Scottish immigrants and became a Canadian businessman and politician.

It was originally fitted with a pair of protective cheek-pieces, which have not survived; the holes by which they were attached can be seen in front of the helmet's ear guards. It is lavishly decorated with incised, punched and embossed figures, indicating that it was probably used for displays or cavalry tournaments, though it may well have been intended to be worn in battle as well. The helmet was found in what appears to have been a carefully arranged deposition in a bed of gravel, distant from any known Roman sites. After it was recovered during road works it was donated to the British Museum in London, where it was restored and is currently on display.British Museum collection database. Accessed 17 November 2010. Design and origins Made from bronze - a copper alloy - in the 3rd century AD, the helmet's brow band is engraved and embossed with representations of shrines (aediculae) housing the deities Victory, Mars and Minerva, all of whom were associated with war. Prancing horsemen are depicted between the figures. The brow band has three diadem-like peaks bordered by writhing snakes whose heads meet at the centre, forming an arch above the central figure of Mars. Two bosses stand out at the rear of the helmet, at the centre of embossed flowers. The sides and top of the helmet are embossed with feathers and a feather-like pattern.Dixon, Karen R.; Southern, Pat. The Roman cavalry: from the first to the third century AD, p. 112. Routledge, 1997. Robinson, H. Russell. The armour of imperial Rome, p. 102. Scribner, 1975. The design is similar to others found in Worthing, Norfolk and Chalon-sur-Saône in France.A visual comparison of the Chalon and Guisborough Helmets, which are extremely similar, can be found in Jochen Garbsch, Römische Paraderüstungen (Beck, Munich, 1978), plate 31. Despite its relative thinness and lavish decoration, it is thought that such helmets would have been used in battle as well as in parades or hippika gymnasia (cavalry tournaments).Dixon, Karen R.; Southern, Pat. The late Roman army, pp. 91-92. Routledge, 1996. The helmet remains something of an enigma. It was buried in a compressed and folded state in complete isolation from any other objects of the same period and at some remove from any known Roman sites; how and why it came to be deposited remains unknown.Phillips, Jenny; Rowe, Peter. Roman Teesside - Archaeological Booklet No. 3 , p. 22. Tees Archaeology, 2004 There is no closely associated fort or fortress in the vicinity. However, the Dutch historian Johan Nicolay has identified a \\"lifecycle\\" for Roman military equipment in which ex-soldiers took items home with them as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites, for instance by votive deposition or burial with the dead.Nicolay, Johan. Armed Batavians: Use and Significance of Weaponry and Horse Gear from Non-military Contexts in the Rhine Delta (50 BC to AD 450). Amsterdam University Press - Amsterdam Archaeological Studies, 2008. Another Roman cavalry helmet, known as the Crosby Garrett Helmet, was discovered in Cumbria in May 2010 in a broadly similar context – away from any known settlements but folded before burial – suggesting that it may have been a votive offering or loot that had been hidden for safe-keeping.Worrell, Sally. \\"LANCUM-E48D73 HELMET\\". Portable Antiquities Scheme. Accessed 17 November 2010. Discovery and restoration Cleveland Railway's now-demolished line, of which the abutments can still be seen The helmet was discovered on 19 August 1864 at Barnaby Grange Farm, about 2 miles west of Guisborough town centre. It was found buried deep in a bed of gravel during road works carried out for the Cleveland Railway Company.Elgee, Frank. Romans in Cleveland, p. 13. Hood, 1923. John Christopher Atkinson described the circumstances of its discovery in an article for The Gentleman's Magazine in September 1864: No other artefacts were found at the site and the bones appeared to have no connection with the helmet. They had apparently been deposited naturally by the prehistoric stream that had laid down the gravel bed. Atkinson noted that the artefact was in a strikingly good condition despite its obvious antiquity and the damage done to it: Detail of the figure of Mars on the front of the helmet He commented that the find appeared to have been \\"deliberately buried in a hole dug for the purpose, just where it was found; and the unbattered, and even unscratched condition of its entire visible surface seems amply to confirm the inference.\\" Its crushed condition meant that it was not initially recognisable as a helmet, though its ornamentation was clearly visible. Atkinson described the outer decoration: It was at first incorrectly identified as a breastplate of unknown origin (Atkinson thought it to be of \\"Oriental workmanship\\") and age. Thomas Richmond, a local historian, erroneously assigned it in 1868 to \\"a late Celtic, or early Anglo-Saxon period\\".Richmond, Thomas. The local records of Stockton and the neighbourhood, p. 268. William Robinson, 1868 In 1878, Frederick B. Greenwood, who owned the land on which the helmet had been found, presented it to the British Museum. It was restored at the museum by Robert Cooper Ready, resulting in the discovery that it was in fact a Roman helmet.Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Volume 7, p. 391. 1876. It is currently on display in the British Museum's Roman Britain section in Room 49. Similar helmets have been found elsewhere in Europe; the closest continental parallel is a helmet found in the River Saône at Chalon-sur-Saône in France in the 1860s.Toynbee, Jocelyn M. C. Art in Britain under the Romans, p. 264. Clarendon Press, 1964.

Social recruiting uses social media profiles, blogs, and other Internet sites to find information on candidates. It also uses social media to advertise jobs either through HR vendors or through crowdsourcing where job seekers and others share job openings within their online social networks. Social recruiting's effectiveness and return on investment have been difficult to determine, since applicants do not usually apply through the social channels which first attracted them. In May 2013, Maximum Employment Marketing Group released the Social Recruitment Monitor, which ranks the reach, engagement, and interactivity of employers' social recruiting efforts around the world. Social recruitment software The social recruitment software market (a form of e-recruitment) is often included in the wider talent management software sector. Bersin & Associates valued the wider talent management market at over $2bn in 2007.Talent Management Suites, Market Realities, Implementation Experiences and Vendor Profiles (2008) Social recruitment increasingly sits at an intersection of a number of fast-moving areas including social networking, recruitment and now cloud computing. Additionally, mobile recruiting has become another hot topic, especially with the rise in tablet and smartphone usage. In 2012, there was a rise of tech companies using social recruiting applications to find and screen applicants. As more companies saw value in filling jobs by putting them on the social platforms where millions of people spend at least 37 minutes daily, there developed a much larger focus on social recruiting among the talent acquisition community. By mid-2013, many major enterprise companies such as Pepsi, Gap, AIG, and Oracle had begun effectively utilizing social recruiting software, making it clear that large corporations were open to automating or streamlining (and ultimately investing in) their social recruiting processes.

He was the son of Emperor Constans II and Fausta, who was elevated in 659, before his father departed for Italy. After the death of Constans Heraclius' brother, Constantine IV, ascended the throne as senior emperor. Constantine attempted to have both Heraclius and Tiberius removed as co-emperors, which sparked a popular revolt in 681. Constantine ended the revolt by promising to accede to the demands of the rebels, sending them home, but bringing their leaders into Constantinople. Once there, Constantine had them executed, then imprisoned Tiberius and Heraclius and had them mutilated, after which point they disappear from history. Life Heraclius was one of the sons of Constans II. His mother was Fausta, daughter of the Patrician Valentinus. Although his elder brother Constantine IV had been raised to the rank of co-emperor in 654, in 659, shortly before his departure for Italy, Constans II also elevated Heraclius to the rank of co-emperor, alongside his brother Tiberius. In 663, Constans tried to have his sons join him in Sicily, where he intended to establish Syracuse as the new capital, but this provoked a popular uprising in Constantinople, led by Theodore of Koloneia and Andrew, and the brothers remained in the imperial capital.. With Constans II’s death in 668, Constantine IV became the senior emperor. After ruling alongside Heraclius and Tiberius for thirteen years, Constantine attempted to demote his brothers from their imperial positions, but this provoked a military revolt in the Anatolic Theme (in modern Turkey). The army marched to Chrysopolis, and sent a delegation across the straits of the Bosporus to Constantinople, demanding that the two brothers should remain co-emperors alongside Constantine IV. They based their demand on the belief that, since Heaven was ruled by the Trinity, in the same way the empire should be governed by three emperors. Confronted by this situation, Constantine kept a close eye on his brothers, and sent across a trusted officer, Theodore, the captain of Koloneia. Constantine gave Theodore the delicate task of praising the soldiers for their devotion and agreeing with their reasoning, with the objective of persuading them to return to their barracks in Anatolia. He also invited the leaders of the rebellion to come over to Constantinople and consult with the Senate in order that they may begin the process of confirming the army’s wishes. Happy with this apparently positive outcome, the army departed back to Anatolia, while the instigators of the movement entered the city. With the military threat now gone, Constantine moved against the leaders of the revolt, captured them and had them hanged at Sycae. Because he was the focus of a plot to curtail Constantine's power, both he and his brother were now suspect in the senior emperor's eyes; also, the emperor was keen to raise up his own son, the future Justinian II. Sometime between 16 September and 21 December 681, Constantine ordered the mutilation of his brothers by slitting their noses, and ordered that their images no longer appear on any coinage, and that their names be removed from all official documentation, likely to ensure that his son, Justinian II, would succeed him. After this point, neither are mentioned again by history.

After his discharge in 1875, he came to the area in 1876 with two companions to work the claim.Melzer, R. (2007) Buried Treasures: Famous and Unusual Gravesites in New Mexico History. Sunstone Press. p 20. = Alma Massacre = On April 29, 1880, Sergeant Cooney, Jack Chick, and a man whose last name was Buhlman were on horseback riding to Alma to warn the settlers of an Indian attack at the Cooney mine and the town of Cooney. Victorio had led a group of Chiricahua Apache tribal members in the massacre. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Cooney's brother Michael and miners from nearby Pinos Altos drilled, blasted and chipped a sepulcher for his remains in a large boulder. The Sergeant has remained interred there since.\\"Cooney's Tomb\\" ,\\"Cooney's Tomb and Cemetery\\" , Catron County Cemeteries. Retrieved 11/17/10. = Cemetery = The area around the tomb soon became a cemetery with a collection of graves. Four graves in front of Cooney's Tomb were enclosed in a low wrought iron fence. A flood washed away those graves, along with two large marble stone markers. The road by the tomb was rebuilt.Brown, N.E. and Boggs, A. (2007) \\"Tomb of Sergeant James Cooney, Gila National Forest\\" . The Conservation Fund. Retrieved 11/17/10. Cooney's brother, Captain Michael Cooney, took over his mine after his death. A town called Cooney was founded shortly thereafter. Michael Cooney died while searching for a lost gold mine in the Mogollon mountains, and the canyon where his body was found was named Cooney Canyon.\\"Cooney's Tomb\\" . Retrieved 11/17/10. Today, Cooney's Tomb is located about 5 miles east of Alma in Cooney Canyon on Mineral Creek. In 2009, The Conservation Fund helped the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquire 40 acres, including the tomb, from a private owner. The tomb is now located within the Gila National Forest.

Settlements are also found in Oklahoma near the town of Guymon and along the Beaver River. The Antelope Creek People were bison hunters, maize farmers, and foragers. They are best known for building large, stone, multifamily dwellings, unique on the Great Plains. Their culture combined characteristics of Southwestern Ancestral Pueblo peoples and Great Plains tribes. The Antelope Creek Phase is also called the Antelope Creek Focus, the Panhandle Phase, the Optima Focus, and the Upper Canark Variant.Gibbon, Guy E. Ed. Archaeology of Pre-Historic Native America: An Encyclopedia. NY:Routledge, 1998, p. 20 Origin The Antelope Creek people were the most southwestern of the cultures making up the Plains Village Tradition which stretched from North Dakota to Texas and extended westward in river valleys from the Eastern Woodlands into the Great Plains. The Plains Villagers adopted the cultivation of corn (maize) and by AD 900 they were living in semi-permanent villages along the watercourses traversing the plains, including, for example, the Washita and Canadian Rivers in Oklahoma.Drass, Richard R. “Redefining Plains Village Complexes in Oklahoma: the Paoli Phase and the Redbed Plains Variant.” Plains Anthropologist, Vol 44, No. 168, 1999, pp. 121–140 By AD 1250, these river valleys were heavily populated with villages of up to 20 houses situated about every two miles.”Oklahoma’s Past” http://www.ou.edu/cas/archsur/counties/garvin.htm, accessed Nov 11, 2010 The Canadian River and the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument. The Antelope Creek People lived mostly on terraces overlooking the river or in side canyons with springs. Most archaeologists believe that the Antelope Creek Phase was a western expansion of farming communities from Oklahoma into the Texas panhandle or an extension southward of similar farming communities from further north.”Texas Beyond History.” http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/buriedcity/who.html, accessed Nov 11, 2010 Although farming was difficult in the dry climate of the Texas panhandle, other food resources such as bison were abundant. Bison or American buffalo are believed to have been uncommon on the southern Great Plains before AD 1000. As the bison population expanded thereafter due to climatic conditions, they became the principal source of protein for people on the southern Plains and their abundance stimulated a growth in population and complexity of the hunting-gathering societies that had inhabited the region for thousands of years. Archaeological sites confirm increased exploitation of bison after AD 1200.”Texas Beyond History.” http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/buriedcity/who.html, accessed Nov 11, 2010; Drass, Richard R. and Flynn, Peggy. “Temporal and Geographic Variations in Subsistence Practices for Plains Villagers in the Southern Plains.” Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 135, No. 128, 1990, pp. 187–188 A major asset of the Canadian River Valley was the large deposits of colorful Alibates flint that could be chipped into tools and weapons and traded to other cultures. The present-day Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument preserves more than 700 quarries where the Indians dug out the flint. Most of the quarries are holes six feet or more in diameter and four to eight feet deep. The presence of Alibates Flint was undoubtedly an economic incentive to settle nearby to control trade in the stone.http://www.nps.gov/alfl/historyculture/index.htm, Accessed Nov 11, 2010 Alibates flint tools have been found up to one thousand miles away. Most archaeologists believe that the Antelope Creek people spoke a Caddoan language and probably ancestors of the historic Wichita and affiliated tribes, possibly, the Pawnee. That opinion is based primarily on the fact that in historic times the farming communities on the Southern Plains were primarily Caddoans. An alternative thesis is that the Antelope Creek people were Pueblo Indians who moved or were pushed onto the Great Plains from their homes near the valley of the Rio Grande in New Mexico. It is also possible that the Antelope Creek people were neither Caddoan nor Pueblo, but an entirely different people. Nor is it certain that all the people of the Antelope Creek culture spoke the same language or belonged to the same ethnic group.Brooks, Robert L. “From Stone Slab Architecture to Abandonment” in Perttula, Timothy K. The Prehistory of Texas. College Station: Texas A&M; U Press, 2004, pp. 334–335 Pioneering archaeologist Alex D. Kreiger summed up the evidence: “To attempt to classify Antelope Creek Focus as either a Plains or Pueblo culture is infeasible, for it was clearly a combination of both... One can hardly escape the impression that the peoples of this focus were Plains agriculturalists who pushed southward from one valley to another as far as eastern New Mexico. Here contact was established with Puebloans who were expanding their territories at the same time.”Kreiger, Alex D. Cultural Complexes and Chronology of Northern Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1946, p. 73 Houses and settlements  The unique and enigmatic characteristic of Antelope Creek was the construction of large stone-slab and plaster houses and one-story apartment blocks. Elsewhere on the Great Plains pre-historic Indian farmers lived in homes constructed from wood, earth, and straw.http://www.ou.edu/cas/archsur/counties/custer.htm Hundreds of Antelope Creek settlements have been discovered. Archaeologist Christopher Lintz identified eleven different variations of buildings in villages, hamlets and isolated farmsteads. The most notable buildings were rectangular, single- storied, multi-room structures with up to 30 rooms. The rooms ranged in size from small up to 60 square meters square (roughly 30 feet by 20 feet). The multi-room dwellings appear to have been constructed between 1200 and 1350. Thereafter, individual dwellings were preferred, often about 6 meters by 6 meters (20×20 feet) in size and using the same stone-slab construction methods.The basic reference is Lintz, Christopher. Architecture and Community Variability within the Antelope Creek Phase of the Texas Panhandle. Studies in Oklahoma’ Past No. 14: Norman: OK Archaeological Survey, 1986. See also Brooks, 336 Houses typically consisted of an east-facing vestibule leading to a single square room recessed about one foot (30 cm) into the ground. The house was divided into thirds. Along the north and south walls of the house were raised benches or platforms; the hearth was located in the center third of the house at a lower level. A platform or table on the west wall of the house may have been an altar. Storage bins were also located against the west wall and pits for storage were dug beneath the benches. Four upright wooden posts near the center of the dwelling held up the roof which was probably sloped and made of intertwined straw and saplings.Brooks, 337 There was, however, a large variety in the structures built by the Antelope Creek people. The time and effort involved in stone-slab and plaster construction implies confidence by the people in the permanence of their settlements. Although some Antelope Creek people lived in the multi-family dwellings, more often they clustered in hamlets of individual homes with a population of not more than eight families. Between hamlets were isolated farmsteads of one or two houses.http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/research/variation.html, accessed Nov 17, 2010 Most dwellings were located on terraces above the Canadian River or near a spring-fed stream or tributary. The population in some areas was dense. The five-mile long Buried City complex on Wolf Creek has more than 100 dwellings capable of housing 15 to 20 people each. The dwellings are spaced about 100 yards from each other, thus resembling the settlement pattern of an American suburb with houses on large lots. If all these dwellings were occupied at the same time, the population may have been 2,000.Texas Beyond History. http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/buriedcity/settlement.html, accessed 7 Aug 2016 Along 50 miles of the Canadian River were more than 300 multi-family dwellings with a population that may have exceeded 10,000. The total population of the Texas Panhandle during the Antelope Creek Phase may have amounted to as many as 30,000. Water can be scarce on the Great Plains, but beneath the surface is the Oglalla aquifer. The water of the Canadian River is salty, so the Antelope Creek people often lived where streams had cut 100 to 200 feet deep into the caprock and springs and small spring-fed watercourses were abundant and reliable. Timber for building and fuel was found in these valleys and canyons.city/index.htm Texas Beyond History Accessed Nov 11, 2010 Subsistence The evidence points to a three-faceted strategy for subsistence among the Antelope Creek people: (1) hunting bison and other animals; (2) cultivation of maize, beans, squash, and sunflowers; and (3) foraging for edible nuts, fruits, and seeds. The relative importance of each of these activities is unclear. Antelope Creek men probably wandered long distances from their village to hunt bison. Although bison were their most important prey, the bones of deer, antelope, and smaller game have also been found in the ruins, plus a few mussels and fish. Arrowheads made from Alibates flint The Antelope Creek people grew corn, beans, squash and probably sunflowers. The Texas Panhandle is a marginal area for unirrigated agriculture, prone to drought and with the bulk of the 16- to 20-inch annual rainfall coming in a few thunderstorms that cause flooding. Thus, the Antelope Creek people probably practiced water harvesting or “Ak-Chin” dryland farming techniques. Crops were planted in arroyos or other depressions which caught runoff from thunderstorms and preserved enough moisture to permit crops to grow and mature. Given the unpredictability of rainfall, a family probably planted small fields – as did other Southwestern peoples—in several different micro-environments with the objective of maximizing the possibility that some of their fields would be productive. In their farming, the Antelope Creek people used bone-tipped digging sticks and bison scapulas as shovels and hoes.Texas Beyond History. http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/buriedcity/settlement.html, accessed 7 Aug 2016 Foraging of wild plants for food was probably important for the Antelope Creek People, particularly because agriculture in the drought-prone panhandle was always hazardous and the abundance of bison varied from season to season and year to year. Among the wild foods eaten were acorns, hackberries, mesquite, buckwheat, plums, persimmons, prickly pear, mallow, cattail, purslane, goosefoot, knotweed, domesticated marshelder, and bulrush.Brooks, 338-339 Food was often cooked in pottery vessels which were made locally and also imported—increasingly as time went on—from the Rio Grande Pueblos. Trade increased dramatically after 1350, indicating the growth of a more outward looking and possibly more mobile Antelope Creek culture.”Antelope Creek Phase.” Handbook of Texas Online. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bba07, Accessed Nov 17, 2010 The end of Antelope Creek The Antelope Creek settlements were abandoned between 1450 and 1500. When Spanish conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado passed through the Texas Panhandle in 1541 he met only nomadic and semi- nomadic buffalo-hunting Indians he called Querechos (Apache) and Teyas (possibly Caddoan).Winship, George Parker (Ed. and Translator) The Journey of Coronado, 1540–1542, from the City of Mexico to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the Buffalo Plains of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, As Told by Himself and his Followers. New York: A.S. Barnes & Co, 1904, 142–215 Several reasons have been advanced for the disappearance of the Antelope Creek people in this region. The first theory is that they exhausted their resources over time and were forced to resettle elsewhere. The second theory is that drought made agriculture increasingly infeasible in the Panhandle and the Antelope Creek people moved to better agricultural lands. The third is that they were forced out of their homes by other Indians, most likely the Apache who were new arrivals to the Southern Plains. Whatever the reason, most archaeologists speculate that the Antelope Creek people migrated eastward to Kansas and Oklahoma and become the Wichita and affiliated tribes, whom Coronado met in Quivira in 1541. The Pawnee of Nebraska also have an oral history that they once lived in stone houses in the Southwest.“The Antelope Creek Focus: Advanced, Pre-Columbian Civilization in the Texas Panhandle.” http://www.panhandlenation.com/history/prehistory/antelope_creek.htm , accessed Nov 11, 2010; http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/research/index.html  References   External links  * Antelope Creek Culture, Alibates Flint Quarries * Antelope Creek Phase, Oklahoma Historical Society * Antelope Creek Phase, Texas State Historical Society Category:Archaeological sites in Texas Category:Archaeological sites in Oklahoma Category:Archaeology of the United States Category:Archaeological cultures of North America Category:Plains Village period Category:Pre-Columbian cultures ","title":"Antelope Creek phase"},{"id":"29644201","text":"The Butterfield Overland Mail in California was created by the United States Congress on March 3, 1857, and operated until June 30, 1861.

This route's terminus was Los Angeles, the headquarters of the Second Division of the Overland Mail. The 2nd Division was headquartered in a brick building at the Pueblo de Los Angeles, consisting of an office, blacksmith shop, stables and sheds. First Division Rancho Los Encinos Stage Station, San Fernando Valley. The First Division's California route north from Los Angeles followed the Stockton - Los Angeles Road that was established as a southern route to the goldfields during the California Gold Rush. The route went through the San Fernando Valley, with a stop at Rancho Los Encinos. It proceeded over Fremont Pass out of the Valley, up San Francisquito Canyon and over San Francisquito Pass, to the Fort Tejon Pass, where it dropped to the San Joaquin Valley. The Butterfield route split off the Stockton - Los Angeles Road at Elkhorn Spring Station. From there it went west across the upper San Joaquin Valley, crossing El Camino Viejo on the Rancho San Luis Gonzaga (St. Louis Ranch). It crossed over the Diablo Mountains at Pacheco Pass to reach to Gilroy. It then proceeded north through the Santa Clara Valley and San Jose, to its western terminus in San Francisco, also the headquarters of the First Division of the Butterfield Overland Mail.Warren E.

When his father was reassigned to Point Cook, the family moved into the housing commission high-rise flats in North Melbourne where Cole attended Flemington High School,Munro, Ian: Change in mind, The Age, 17 October 2009. and Kyneton High School in 1974. In 1980, he graduated with a law degree from the University of Melbourne, and in the same year, founded the Flemington Community Legal Service where he worked as a community lawyer for seven years. Political career Cole first entered politics at a local level, serving on the Melbourne City Council for three years in the 1980s. In 1988, Cole decided to run for the safe Labor seat of Melbourne in the Victorian Parliament. Preselection for Melbourne was considered \\"unwinnable\\", given that the candidacy for the seat was already earmarked for ALP state secretary Jenny Beacham. Aware that he was \\"supposed\\" to lose by nine votes, Cole worked the numbers and managed to win preselection, subsequently winning the seat at the 1988 state election. In 1992, he was promoted to Joan Kirner's shadow cabinet as Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs and Shadow Attorney-General. Early in his political career, Cole had suffered a number of mental breakdowns. In 1993, he was diagnosed with manic-depressive disorder. In 1995, Cole's condition became public knowledge as it was leaked to the media by his political enemies,Bunworth, Mick: Gallop's honesty applauded, The 7.30 Report (ABC TV), 17 January 2006. and he publicly declared that he suffered from mental illness, stood down as Shadow Attorney-General, and was admitted to The Melbourne Clinic shortly afterwards.Mangan, John: Odd bedfellows – the MP and the anxious gangster, The Age, 10 October 2010.
