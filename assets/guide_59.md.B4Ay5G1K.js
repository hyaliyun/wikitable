Early life Mary Ann Black, was born in Sydney on 1 October 1801. Her mother was the former convict Mary Hyde (1779‚Äì1864) who in 1855 took the Commissioners of City of Sydney to the House of Lords and won. Her father was Captain John Black (1788‚Äì1802), a ship's officer and a privateer (state-sanctioned pirate). Mary Ann was their second child, and only daughter. Her father died in 1802 when his ship the Fly was lost at sea with all hands. After this Mary Ann's mother moved in with (and later married) a business associate of Mary Ann's late father Simeon Lord (1771‚Äì1840) a pioneer merchant and a magistrate in Australia, who became Mary Ann's stepfather. .Taka by Peter Entwhistle, pgs 40-44 In July 1807 Mary Ann was baptised at St Philip's Church in Sydney.Parish records of St Philips Church Sydney Her stepfather Simeon Lord held land in trust for Mary Ann and her brother, land that backed onto the Tank Stream and had originally been leased by their late father Captain John Black, where Mary Ann and her brother had been born, and where her mother had been living prior to her relationship with Simeon Lord. On her marriage Mary Ann receiving her portion of the land in George St., SydneyThis property is today found near De Mestre Place in Sydney on the eastern side of George Street, between Hunter Street and Martin Place. as a dower.An inheritance from her father, ownership of which passed to her husband on her marriage. Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth-Century England (which also applied in the Colony of New South Wales) Marriage to Prosper de Mestre Mary Ann married at the age of 19 on 1 March 1821 at St Philip's Church in Sydney to Prosper de Mestre who was 12 years her senior, and a business associate of her stepfather Simeon Lord. Prosper, a merchant like her stepfather, was a good catch, and the large family was well and luxuriously provided for, becoming an important part of the fabric of Sydney in the 1820s to the 1840s. Her husband eventually owned properties in Sydney, and elsewhere in New South Wales, including at Shoalhaven on the South Coast. Mary Ann was also a good catch for de Mestre, with her stepfather Simeon Lord's connections being invaluable to de Mestre's business dealings. When her husband Prosper de Mestre became insolvent in 1844, and most of his land and property needed to be auctioned to pay his debts, Mary Ann moved to prevent the Shoalhaven properties being sold. As the George St. property had been her dower, she questioned whether it should be included in the sale. Her solution was that the more valuable George St. property could be included in the sale, if the Shoalhaven properties were not. In exchange she also asked for \\"the whole of the plate, horses etc., etc., on the establishment in Liverpool Street, the six cows, horse and cart at Helsarmel\\", and to be \\"permitted to occupy the thirty-two acres at Petersham until the house at Shoal Haven can be rendered fit for the residence of my family.\\" The family house in Liverpool St, and its \\"elegant Household Furniture\\", was sold by auction on 16 May 1844, and the family was moved to briefly to Petersham and then onto Terara, which Mary Ann‚Äôs husband Prosper had initially developed as a hobby farm. Over a period of twenty years Mary Ann gave birth to 10 children, in the day when home births were the norm. When her husband Prosper de Mestre died in 1844 she was left with a large family to raise that included adult children and teenagers, but also included young children, with four children under the age of 10, and her youngest child being was less than 3 years old. To raise her family Mary Ann continued to work the Shoalhaven property of Terara with the aid of her three sons. Mary Ann, together with her three sons, Prosper John (1821‚Äì1863), Andre (1823‚Äì1917) and Etienne (1832‚Äì1916) de Mestre, was also instrumental in furthering the development of the village of Terara near her \\"Terara\\" property after her husband's death in 1844. They added three wharves in 1854, in 1856 a Church of England on land she donated and with capital she largely provided, and established a steam-driven flour mill in 1856. The steam flourmill was managed by the eldest son, Prosper John de Mestre who lived at Millbank. Andre and Etienne de Mestre lived at Terara House. By 1866 the village of Terara was a bigger and more important centre than Nowra. When the Shoalhaven River flooded in 1870 settlement began to shift from Terara to the Nowra site 3 km west.Australian heritage ‚Äì Nowra Later years Mary Ann Black was a widow for 16 years before her death on 11 July 1861. She left a will that divided her property amongst her children. Millbank was left to Prosper John de Mestre, along with the steam mill and premises which he was occupying at the time. The Terara House and property was left to Andre and Etienne de Mestre, and the 7 girls each received a portion of land. Mary Ann was buried on the Terara property next to her husband Prosper de Mestre on land that she had donated to the church. Against her stated wishes, the land has been sold by the church, and the exact location of the graves is now lost.

His father, Major Adalbert Linke, was a Galician soldier; his mother, Lucy Crawford, was British. Despite this mixed background, he was an Austrian citizen. Linke-Crawford attended school in Meran, Tyrol and Hranice (Wei√ükirchen), Moravia before in 1910 he entered the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. Upon graduation, he was commissioned Lieutenant and assigned to the 6th Dragoon Regiment. On 28 July, a month after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Austria- Hungary declared war on Serbia.http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/linkecrawford.htm This was the initial declaration of war that snowballed into World War I. Linke-Crawford first saw battle on the Russian Front. In November 1914 he was appointed commander of the infantry troop of the Sixth Dragoons. Between October 1914 and October 1915, he received several decorations; he also was hospitalized several times with malaria and dysentery. In 1915, Linke-Crawford's fascination with the Luftfahrtruppen (Austro-Hungarian air service) led him to request a transfer for pilot training. His poor health is also mentioned as a reason for his transfer. Aerial service Upon his completion of observer training at Wiener-Neustadt in March 1916, Linke-Crawford was posted to Fliegerkompanie 22 to fly reconnaissance and bombing missions in two seater airplanes. In September 1916, after six active months flying as an observer, he retrained as a pilot. In January 1917 he was transferred to Fliegerkompanie 12 as chief pilot, which made him second in command of the unit. His new posting was still to a unit serving on the Isonzo Front in northern Italy. While his duties remained recon and bombing, he was now operating over mountainous terrain. He also flew some attack sorties in single seat fighters. On one of these missions, on 13 April, he shot down a Nieuport that cartwheeled into a crash far behind the Italian lines. He did not bother to attempt to claim this victory, though he mentioned it in a letter home to his sister. On 25 May, his aircraft was badly shot up, taking 14 hits from a couple of SPAD fighters. He then had another unconfirmed triumph on 25 June. He gained a reputation for courage. On one of his long range reconnaissance missions, he was attacked by an Italian SPAD, which riddled his Hansa-Brandenburg C.I with 68 bullet holes over a half-hour period. Nevertheless, he completed his mission. On 2 August 1917, while flying his Aviatik C.I with no rear gunner aboard to man the craft's single machine gun, he was shot down as Pier Piccio's eighth victim, but was uninjured.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/italy/piccio.php Frank Linke-Crawford in front of his Albatros with falcon insigna, October 1917 On 4 August 1917, he was transferred to Fliegerkompanie 41, situated near Trieste. Flik 41 was Austro-Hungary's most renowned air unit; it was commanded by the empire's top ace, Godwin von Brumowski. Linke-Crawford damaged his airplane upon landing at his new base, Sesana Airfield. He began wearing a scarlet flying helmet and white trousers when he flew, leading to the nickname of \\"Redhead\\". He marked his plane with falcons painted on either side. He scored his first confirmed aerial victory on 21 August 1917, using a Hansa- Brandenburg D.I to down a Nieuport. In the next five days, he scored three more confirmed wins using this plane, with one claim going unconfirmed. The Hansa-Brandenburg D.I had serious liabilities as a fighter plane; it spun easily, had poor forward visibility, and its machine gun was mounted well above the pilot's head on the top wing to fire above the propeller arc.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/austrhun/hansa_di.php It was nicknamed \\"the flying coffin\\" and killed more pilots in flying accidents than died in combat. Linke-Crawford's switch to flying an Albatros D.III mounted him in a fighter that not only offered him better field of vision, especially downward, but also armed him with twin Spandau machine guns in front of him that were synchronized to fire through his propeller.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/germany/albatros_diii.php Flying the Albatros D.III, he shot down a seaplane on 23 September 1917 to become an ace. Continuing to use the Albatros, he ran up a score of 13 by 13 December. In late December 1917 Linke-Crawford was appointed commander of Fliegerkompanie 60. This unit was stationed at Grigno in northern Italy until March 1918. This airfield was located in a swampy mountainous basin and was prone to flooding. Flik 60j's seven pilots flew against an opposition of British, Italian, and French pilots. Linke-Crawford's plane in Flik 60j was a Phonix D.I. He used this slow but sturdy twin-gunned fighter to run up seven triumphs in the first three months of 1918. Flik 60 transferred to Feltre, also in northern Italy. This was a better airfield than Grigno. Linke-Crawford scored his last victory in a Phonix on 11 March. Aeroplanes of this nature were still in their early phases of development, and in mid-March, he is said to have grounded all the Phonix's in his unit because of their increasing unreliability. Beginning on 10 May, Linke-Crawford switched to an Aviatik (Berg) D.I (115.32) At least five of his seven victories in this machine were over superior aircraft, such as the Sopwith Camel and Bristol F.2 Fighters. Death and legacy On 30 July 1918, the day after his final victory, he was flying an early model Aviatik (Berg) D.I in a formation of four. He was shot down in flames by a pair of Italian Hanriot HD.1 fighters, with his plane disintegrating before impact. Linke-Crawford had separated from his wingmen before engaging the Italians. His plane had spun out before engaging them; he had then recovered and been fired upon. His plane had then fallen apart in midair. Linke-Crawford was accredited as Caporale Aldo Astolfi's sole success as a fighter pilot. Given that the Aviatik was the first fighter manufactured entirely in Austria, and that it initially had a reputation for wing failures during violent aerial maneuvers, there was suspicion that Linke-Crawford had fallen afoul of a faulty airplane rather than an Italian pilot.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aircraft/austrhun/aviatik_di.php While the original Aviatik D-I design by Julius von Berg was sound, the Series 115 aircraft license-produced by the Lohner firm at Wien-Floridsdorf were notorious for failures along the wing trailing edges in high speed maneuvers, as Lohner had deviated from Aviatik specifications by employing thinner, lighter wing ribs. At the time of his death, Linke-Crawford was flying one of these sub-standard machines, build number 115.32. His legacy was best described by one of his peers, Julius Arigi, who was the second ranked Austro- Hungarian ace:http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/austrhun/arigi.php \\"Linke was both a fine flier and a fine man. He gave his men full support and generally ignored the rules about officers and non-officers having little to do with each other. He often gave away victories to other, less experienced pilots. As you can imagine, the feelings of his men for him were quite strong.\\" Although Frank Linke-Crawford was originally buried at Pobre≈æje Cemetery in Maribor (now Slovenia) after the war, in 1919, he was reinterred in Salzburg.

Background on fencing in Singapore  Fencing is a small but growing sport in Singapore. The National Sport Association that helps to oversee fencing in Singapore is Fencing Singapore. Generally, fencing is in a handful of schools at all levels, including primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics, and universities. Some country clubs in Singapore also have fencing, and other schools and organizations are known to organize limited fencing workshops once in a while. There are about 10 commercial fencing clubs in Singapore; the clubs provide fencing coaching services to the schools and organizations as well as provide instruction to retail/private customers.  Fencing coaches  Blade Club coaches are generally national-level athletes from Singapore, mostly coaching on a part-time basis. A handful of the coaches are full-time staff, including Olympic fencer Nontapat Panchan of Thailand (who took part in the Beijing 2008 Games), and other coaches from Europe. Including a few other local full-time coaches, the Blade Club coaching staff numbers between 10-15 (full- and part-time).

She was Rabbi of South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue in London from 2012 until 2014. Morris was born in Canada where she studied and qualified in Law before choosing to study for the rabbinate in London, qualifying in 2002. Career Morris gained an MA in Jewish History from McGill University in 1989 before continuing her studies to gain an LLB, also at McGill University, before completing her articles at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto. In 1997, she decided upon a career change and left Canada to study rabbinics at Leo Baeck College in London, graduating in 2002. In the final year of rabbinic studies, she returned to Canada where she served as Rabbi at Har Tikvah, in Brampton, Ontario and Temple Shalom, in Kitchener, Ontario/Waterloo, Ontario from 2001 till 2003. She became the first female Rabbi in Scotland when she was appointed to the post of Rabbi of Glasgow Reform Synagogue in October 2003. During her tenure, Rabbi Morris was also a Guest Lecturer at the University of Glasgow where she lectured on Judaism. In January 2012, Rabbi Morris returned to her native Canada to take on a temporary post of Rabbi at Temple B'nai Tikvah in Calgary. In June 2012, South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue (often referred to by the acronym SWESRS) in London announced that Rabbi Morris had been appointed as their new Rabbi. She began this position in September 2012 and held the role until 2014, when she and her husband returned to Toronto. Role within the Jewish community Rabbi Morris strongly supports the egalitarian nature of Progressive Judaism and has spoken a number of times on issues relating to gender equality within Judaism. In particular she was strongly critical of the arrest of Anat Hoffman, head of Women Of The Wall, and publicly wrote to the Israeli Ambassador to the UK on behalf of her Synagogue community about the arrest. Rabbi Morris also called on the incoming Chief Rabbi to demonstrate his commitment to repairing divisions between different Jewish traditions by publicly criticising the detention of Emily Wolfson for wearing a Tallit at the Kotel. Rabbi Morris conducted the Bat Mitzvah of Ms Wolfson when she was Rabbi at Glasgow Reform Synagogue and encourages girls to embrace Jewish ritual such as wearing a tallit upon their Bat Mitzvah. Consequently, Rabbi Morris felt strongly that the grounds of detention [i.e. a female wearing a tallit] were both unjustified and a dangerous escalation of attempts by Orthodox authorities to exclude women and Progressive Jews from one of the most sacred locations in Judaism. Rabbi Morris helped conduct the Purim celebrations for a group of Bnei Menashe in 2010 when she was in Mumbai, India on a sabbatical. Role as a community leader As leader of the second largest stream of Judaism in Scotland, Rabbi Morris participated in interfaith meetings as well as speaking at various events, presenting a modern, liberal, Jewish perspective on a variety of subjects. On this basis, Rabbi Morris presented the Time For ReflectionOfficial Report Of Scottish Parliament For 25 June 2008 at the Scottish Parliament on 25 June 2008. Connections with East End of London Rabbi Morris' paternal grandfather grew up in London's East End in the early 1900s before emigrating to Canada. This family connection partly influenced Rabbi Morris to take up the post at SWESRS as the synagogue has a strong connection with the East End. In an amazing coincidence, when researching her family history, Rabbi Morris discovered she was also related to Second Lieutenant Harry Jassby, a World War I RAF pilot who was killed on 6 November 1918 at an airfield very close to the Oaks Lane location of SWESRS. Despite being Jewish, Second Lieutenant Jassby was buried in the Christian cemetery at St Peter's Church which was the closest graveyard to the airfield where he was killed. Members of SWESRS look after the grave and Rabbi Morris conducts an annual Remembrance Service at the graveside. Broadcasting Rabbi Morris was interviewed by Ian Wyatt on his BBC Essex radio programme on which she discussed her career and decision to become a Rabbi. Wyatt also explored her thoughts on the atheist arguments of Richard Dawkins concerning religion. Rabbi Morris explained she feels his arguments focus too much on disputing the literalist interpretation of scriptures as emphasized by religious fundamentalists. Fundamentalism is only espoused by very extremist groups of religious people, and the vast majority of people of faith do not necessarily take such a literalist view of Scripture. Dawkins, in her opinion, fails to address the wider social, emotional, spiritual and cultural benefits for human beings who are devoted to their religious beliefs. Rabbi Morris particularly loves the discussion and lively debate that forms such an important part of Jewish tradition and understanding of Judaism throughout its history.BBC Essex Ian Wyatt programme ‚Äì broadcast Sunday 16 December 2012 (no longer available for download from the BBC site) Rabbi Morris appeared regularly on BBC Radio Scotland's Thought For The Day slot where she presented, from a Jewish perspective, brief talks designed to cause listeners to pause for reflection. Rabbi Morris also contributed to the BBC radio programme on Matisyahu with her predecessor at Glasgow Reform Synagogue, Rabbi Pete Tobias. Publications Rabbi Morris studied in Vienna for a year while she wrote her Master's Thesis on the subject of Ludwig Frankl. It is available to view on the McGill University website. Rabbi Morris contributed to the book God, Doubt and Dawkins, a Reform response to Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion. She also publishes selected Torah commentary and articles on her own website.

Pr√∏ysen wrote the lyrics for the song in 1946, to a traditional tune. Musevisa is a secular song, where a family of anthropomorphic mice are preparing for Christmas. The mouse-mother specifically warns her children against the dangers of the mousetrap. In December 2008 the alleged rediscovery of a missing verse from the song attracted the attention of the Norwegian media. Though an alternative ending was originally written for the song, the discovery in question was eventually revealed to be a hoax. Creation In the late autumn of 1946, Pr√∏ysen (1914‚Äì1970), who had just left his job as a farm hand, received a commission from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) to write a Christmas song for children. Before presenting the song to the network, he met with his friend Arnljot H√∏yland near the Oslo railway station Vestbanen, to get his opinion on the song he had written. Pr√∏ysen said he was worried about the happy and sympathetic tone of the song, since the subject was mice, considered a pest. For this reason he had written an alternative ending to the lyrics. H√∏yland told him not to worry, correctly predicting that this would not be an issue. Pr√∏ysen presented the song in its original form, it was accepted and became an instant classic. H√∏yland never heard the alternative ending. Rediscovery of missing verse Alf Pr√∏ysen c. 1949. It was assumed that the poet, had he been alive, would have appreciated the hoax. In December 2008, NRK-presenter Vidar L√∏nn-Arnesen claimed to have found the missing verse. In L√∏nn-Arnesen's version, it was children's program host \\"Onkel\\" Lauritz Johnson who had objected to the original verse, and asked Pr√∏ysen to write a new one. In the original version the mice were eaten by a cat, which Johnson found too disturbing for children's radio. The original verse had been thrown away, but a cleaning maid had picked it up. The woman had kept the piece of paper, but fifty years laternow living in Thailandshe sent it back to NRK. Then, in 2008, L√∏nn-Arnesen was editing a Christmas songbook, and decided to include the original verse and the story behind it. The story attracted widespread attention in Norwegian newspapers, but not everybody was ready to accept it. Ove R√∏sbak, who had written a biography on Pr√∏ysen, had interviewed H√∏yland and others, and debunked L√∏nn-Arnesen's story as false. The song in its present version was in fact the original, according to R√∏sbak, and if another version existed this had to be a discarded early draft. Pointing out the poor literary quality as the reason why the extra verse had been abandoned, he still conceded that the verse was written by Pr√∏ysen: \\"There is no doubt about that, but there's a reason why it ended up in the dustbin.\\" R√∏sbak also took issue with the late Johnson being presented as a prude who censored controversial content. L√∏nn-Arnesen stuck to his version of the events, but insisted that he had never intended any disrespect to Johnson, who had been his colleague. Hoax revealed Ivar Kalleberg On 23 December 2008, former NRK-photographer Ivar Kalleberg revealed that it was in fact he who had written the missing verse, as a hoax. Kalleberg had used an old yellowed piece of paper, and copied Pr√∏ysen's handwriting from a letter he had once received from him. He then asked his neighbor if she would compose a letter, posing as the fictional retired cleaning lady. Kalleberg claimed to have used the Hitler Diaries as an inspiration for the hoax. To back up his claim, Kalleberg referred to an autobiography he had written in 2003, where he had reproduced the verse from memory, almost verbatim. R√∏sbak appreciated Kalleberg's hoax, though he commented that the episode did raise some issues about source criticism in the Norwegian publishing business. L√∏nn-Arnesen admitted that, although he didn't believe Kalleberg's story, if he had indeed been the victim of a practical joke, it was a good one. Kalleberg, meanwhile, was convinced that Pr√∏ysen would have appreciated the hoax had he been alive. The poet was once, in the 1950s, informed about an impostor who performed under his name. He reacted with a shrug and replied \\"Perhaps he sings better than I do.\\" Swedish version There is a Swedish version of the song - without the false verse - called \\"M√∂ssens julafton\\" (\\"Christmas Eve for the Mice\\") written by Pr√∏ysen's long time co-operative partner, the popular Swedish composer and songwriter Ulf Peder Olrog. In Sweden, Olrog usually is known as the composer of the song's melody.

It is placed in the extinct order Uraraneida, spider-like animals able to produce silk, but which lacked true spinnerets and retained a segmented abdomen bearing a flagellum-like tail resembling that of a whip scorpion. They are thought to be close to the origins of spiders. Its name is taken from the English dialect word attercop (\\"spider\\"), which came from ' (\\"poison-head\\"), from ' (\\"poison\\"), itself drawn from the Proto- Germanic *aitra- (\\"poisonous ulcer\\") and kopp- (\\"head\\"). An important Early Devonian (about ) fossil example from Gilboa, New York, was originally described as a member of the extinct order Trigonotarbida and named Gelasinotarbus? fimbriunguis. It was later assigned to a new genus Attercopus and reinterpreted as the oldest, and most primitive, example of a true spider (Araneae). This hypothesis was based on the supposed presence of unique spider features such as silk-producing spinnerets and the opening of a venom gland on the fang of the chelicera. Further study ‚Äì based on new fossils from a comparable Devonian locality called South Mountain ‚Äì and comparison with other material from the Permian of Russia, i.e., of Permarachne, indicates that Attercopus does not actually have spinnerets. The feature which looked like a tubular spinneret is actually a folded sheet of cuticle. It would, however, have produced silk from a series of silk gland openings, or spigots, located across plates on the underside of the abdomen. The opening for the venom gland is also a misinterpretation. A segmented tail, or flagellum, also belonged to this animal. It seems unlikely that Attercopus spun webs, but it may have used its silk to wrap eggs, lay draglines or construct burrow walls. Attercopus fimbriunguis is not a spider, but it is probably close to the type of animals which did give rise to modern spiders today.

BBC says its satellite broadcasts being disrupted from Iran BBC adds more satellites for its Persian TV servicehttp://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100108-france-seeks-itu- signal-jamming-iran.html In response, BBC Persian started transmission on other satellites and increased their broadcast hours in order to combat the interference The channel has been accused by Iranian state television of encouraging \\"illegal\\" rallies and manipulating the Iranian people against the Islamic Republic, a claim which the BBC denies. The jamming resumed on 20 December 2009, soon after BBC Persian began extended coverage of the protests resulting from the death of leading reformist cleric Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri, BBC Persian television broadcasting despite interference from Iran and on 28 December 2009, BBC Persian ceased its transmission from the Hot Bird 6 satellite., Kingofsat - \\"2009-12-28 BBC Persian has left 11117.00MHz\\" however, transmissions continued from the Telstar 12, Eutelsat W2M and Atlantic Bird 4A satellites. Kingofsat - \\"BBC Persian (All satellites)\\" BBC Persian returned to a different frequency on Hot Bird 6 \\"(Hotbird Service Provider)\\" on 26 May 2010, after a period of test transmissions. After a new jamming in February 2011 on Hotbird, BBC Persian showed for some months only a test card along with the audio of their service. Since February 2012, BBC Persian has resumed broadcasting on Hotbird again. Due to the ban on foreign reporters in Iran, the news service currently relies on a significant amount of user-generated content, often taken with mobile phones.BBC Persian works round restrictions , BBC News, 2009-06-23. In 2017, Iranian authorities seized the Iranian assets of 152 contributors to BBC Persian, while in 2016 they detained former BBC World Service Trust employee Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The Iranian government has \\"targeted\\" the members and family members of BBC Persian through threats, intimidation, and arrests. In 2018 the BBC made a request to the UN Human Rights Council to \\"stop Iran from harassing its Persian service staff in London and their families in Iran.\\"  Awards  It appears that Iranian presidential election, 2009 and what followed greatly elevated BBC Persian TV's stature and importance. It became the channel that extensively covered the events for the Iranians inside Iran. Outside of Iran, the channel was therefore recognised accordingly. On 4 November 2009, BBC Persian TV was honoured for the \\"Clearest coverage of a single news event ‚Äì television\\" by the Association for International Broadcasting at its annual global media excellence awards at a gala event in London, England. The award was for \\"the elections that shook Iran\\".http://www.aib.org.uk/newsContent.asp?node_id=8,95&content;_id=2047 It was a half-hour narration of the unrest that developed in the streets of Iran immediately after the disputed June presidential elections. On 20 November 2009, BBC Persian TV was honoured at the 12th annual Hot Bird TV Awards in Venice, Italy. It was named best news channel for its portrayal of unbiased news in a complex and fast-moving environment.

The book covered every model made by Ferrari up to the Ferrari 360 Modena accompanied by colour photographs. Background According to an article in The Independent, Clarkson said that in 1999, an old friend of his, Pete Butters, stopped by to re-live old times and have a drink of whisky. Butters suggested that Clarkson should write a book about Ferrari for his new publishing company, who specialise in limited edition books. Clarkson agreed to write the book. Keith Bluemel, a writer with a background of published books about historic Ferraris, was credited as the technical editor. Print editions 1500 copies of the book were printed and each was individually numbered. 550 copies were leather-bound with an embossed silver plaque. The remainder were cloth-bound, costing ¬£245 each. Reception The book was widely criticised in the media. Clarkson branded it a \\"ridiculous tome\\". Thoroughbred and Classic Car magazine criticised the book for having the tone of vanity publishing, relying too much on car show snapshots of questionable quality. The book was also criticised for placing too much emphasis on mainstream models and being too similar to other Ferrari books that cost considerably less. Andrew Frankel of Motor Sport magazine in describing the book as \\"the better candidates for the most disappointing book I have ever reviewed\\"; criticised the content of the book as \\"doesn't read like Clarkson at all\\" and \\"bewilderingly lacking in his trademark style and humour\\" whilst praising the book's bind quality and \\"comprehensive history of almost all Ferrari's road cars\\". To summarise it, they described the book as \\"at best, an overpriced and entirely missed opportunity. At worst, it is a cynical exploitation of two famous names that fails to come within a light year of doing justice to either.\\" They criticised many of the photographs in the book as \\"seem to be little more than snaps; some, staggeringly, are not even truly in focus while others appear to be poor quality duplicates blown up far beyond their modest capabilities\\" in addition as too many of them as \\"just plain boring\\". Clarkson, after reading a copy himself and reading the reviews, stated that the \\"reviews have been bad but they don't go far enough\\". In an issue of Top Gear Magazine he said it was the worst thing he had ever done. He added, excepting Captain Corelli's Mandolin and A. A. Gill's Sap Rising, he \\"considered it to be the worst book in the world\\" and suggested that \\"anyone thinking about buying it should flush the money down the loo instead\\". Clarkson received no payment for the book. The combined high price and dubious quality of the book, resulted in slow sales compared to other high-end automotive books. As of 2009, second-hand copies command ¬£150.

Trees of the genus Cryptocarya are mostly from the tropics or warmer temperate areas. This tree is unusual as it grows in cooler regions, subject to frost and rare snowfall. It is also an unusually tall member of the genus. The trunk is often buttressed, and the grey or white cylindrical trunk is a conspicuous feature in the rainforest. Leaves are 6 to 13 centimetres long, white and veiny underneath. The small cream flowers form in early summer, the fruit is a black drupe maturing in the cooler months.

The architect was Antonio Barluzzi.The Churches of Antonio Barluzzi, Canon Peter C Nicholson, McCabe Educational Trust, accessed April 2010 It was built on the ruins of an ancient (4th‚Äì6th- century) Byzantine church and a 12th-century church of the Crusader Kingdom period. There is a Greek Orthodox church located on Mount Tabor as well, dedicated to the same purpose. Architecture The church contains three grottoes belonging to the Crusader church. They were described by Jonas Korte, a publisher from Eldena, as \\"three chapels, with a small altar. They are called tabernacles, and they are said to represent the three huts which Peter desired to build, one for his Master (Jesus), the other two for Moses and Elias (Elijah)\\". The Grotto of Christ is in the eastern part of the church. Steps lead down to a lower level containing a sanctuary roofed with a modern vault. There is a chapel in each of the two towers at the western end of the church. The Chapel of Elijah is located in the south tower; the north tower holds the Chapel of Moses. In the upper part of the church there is a mosaic on a gold ground representing the Transfiguration. On August 6, which is the \\"day of the Transfiguration\\" in some church calendars, the sun strikes a glass plate set into the floor so that the golden mosaic is briefly illuminated. Barluzzi has created a roof built of alabaster panels, meant to let in as much light as possible in accordance to the biblical event celebrated here. However, the alabaster roof could not be made watertight and had to be covered over with a common, non-translucent roof. The Transfiguraton The Transfiguration of Jesus is an event reported by the Synoptic Gospels in which Jesus is transfigured upon a mountain (, , ). Jesus becomes radiant, speaks with Moses and Elijah, and is called \\"Son\\" by God. The transfiguration put Jesus above Moses and Elijah, the two preeminent figures of Judaism. Several mountains have been identified as the site of the Transfiguration; for example, the tallest mountain in Israel, Mount Hermon. Mount Tabor is closer to the center of Jesus's activities, and therefore the Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem wrote in the year 348 that he preferred Mount Tabor to Mount Hermon. Thus Mount Tabor was accepted as the site of the transfiguration of Christ.

Life and rule The actual status and reality of Bledric is difficult to ascertain as he figures in much old Welsh literature variously as \\"King\\", \\"Duke\\" or \\"Prince\\" of Devonshire and/or Cornwall. He was described as Duke of Cornwall by c.603,Carew, Richard. The Survey of Cornwall And An Epistle Concerning the Excellencies of the English Tongue. London. 1769 p77 and an ally of northern Welsh kings. The fullest account of Bledric's life comes from Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae where he is numbered amongst the legendary Dukes of Cornwall. Here Bledric, Duke of Cornwall, was the commander of the allied British armies which included King Cadvan of North Wales (Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd) and King Margadud of South Wales (probably Maredydd ap Rhain of Dyfed) at the Battle of Bangor-is-Coed. He joined battle with the army of √Üthelfrith of Northumbria who had just slain 1200 monks, and succeeded in wounding √Üthelfrith and defeating the Angles but being slain himself.Evans, Sebastian. Histories of the Kings of Britain, by Geoffry of Monmouth. 1904 p301 Some authors have Peredur, son of Cado ap Gerren, ruling as king in the fl. 7th century, descended from a different line of Dumnonian kings from Gerren Llyngesic.Ashley, Mike The Mammoth Book of British Kings & Queens New York: Carroll & Graff 1998 p118 This is as given in the Dumnonian king-list derived from Jesus College, Oxford, MS 20.Snyder, Christopher A. The Britons Blackwell 2003 p166 Family Bledric was one of three sons of king Constantine (or Custennin) who died in c.560, his brothers being Gerren rac Denau, who he may have succeeded as king, and Domuel (or Dywel). He also had a sister who married Peibio Clafrog, king of Ergyng in South Wales. Bledric may have had two sons, Clemen as given in the Llyfr Baglan (Book of Baglan) who is thought to have succeeded him, and Blethyn as given by Caradoc of Llancarfan. Death Caradoc of Llancarfan, in his Historie of Cambria (History of Wales), notes that Bledric was one of the British leaders killed by King √Üthelfrith of Northumbria and King √Üthelberht of Kent at Bangor on the River DeePowell, David.

His sons apparently went on to 'enjoy the government of North Wales ever since Cadfan ap Iago was chief King in Britain.' Caradoc of Llancarfan also gives Bledric's descendants elsewhere and gives Blethyn (or Bleddyn) as his son and Ednowen (or Ednowain) as his grandson.

For example, Devon County Council has published a diversity guide which defines White Irish people as a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) category. NHS Bradford District also defines White Irish as an ethnic minority group. Kirklees Council uses the abbreviation 'Ethnicity Code' WIRI for White Irish persons.

Along with the White British population, the group was one of only two ethnic groups to decrease in number in the ten-year period. =Birthplace= In England, about 81 percent of those born in the Republic of Ireland, at the time of the 2011 census, identified as White Irish. Contrastingly, of those born in Northern Ireland, and living in England, 14 percent considered themselves White Irish. There were around 174,000 English-born people in the White Irish population of England.

Social and health issuesHealth= A 2009 study published in Ethnicity & Health demonstrated that the grouping self-reported higher rates of poor general health than the White British populace. This was found to be particularly the case in Northern Ireland, for those who had designated themselves as \\"White, and with an \\"Irish\\" national identity. In 2020, a UCL study based in NHS England data, showed that the White Irish group was around 50 percent less at risk of death than people usually considered as black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME). This was significantly lower than the White British group, which were 12 percent lower than the average risk for BAME communities. =Identity= In 2015 research, University of Southampton fellow Dr Rosalind Willis explored the social fragility of the White Irish ethnicity, particularly in England where distinctions between White British and White Irish are, at times, openly denied.

Cause In April 1839 five Indigenous people were killed by three white men. In response Hugh Bryan, a shepherd, and James Neill, a hut keeper were killed in May 1839 by Aboriginals identified as Daung Wurrung, who had robbed a hut of bedding, clothes, guns and ammunition and also ran a flock of 700 sheep off the property, possibly as retribution for the earlier Aboriginal deaths.Needs citation The Daung Wurrung were enemies of the Dja Dja Wurrung.Bain Attwood, pp7-9 My Country. A history of the Djadja Wurrung 1837-1864, Monash Publications in History:25, 1999, Massacre Hutton immediately put together an armed party of settlers who tracked and finally caught the Aboriginals with a flock of sheep 30 miles away near the Campaspe Creek. An armed confrontation between the settlers and Aboriginals occurred for up to half an hour. Hutton claimed privately that nearly 40 Aboriginal people were killed. The following month Hutton led a party of mounted police and came upon a party of local Dja Dja Wurrung whom Hutton had previously forced off his run, even though these people had been friendly to him since his arrival. The Aboriginal camp near the Campaspe Creek was charged by Hutton and the mounted police with no warning given, with six Dja Dja Wurrung being shot in the back and killed as they tried to flee and others wounded. Charles Parker, the Assistant Protector of Aborigines for the region, described the massacre as: > ...it was a deliberately planned illegal reprisal on the aborigines, > conducted on the principle advocated by many persons in this colony, that > when any offence is committed by unknown individuals, the tribe to which > they belong should be made to suffer for it. George Robinson described Charles Hutton and his attitude to \\"the blacks\\" in his journal of 24 January 1840: > Mr H. avowed [his approach to the natives] to be terror; to keep the natives > in subjection by fear, and to punish them wholesale, that is, by tribes and > communities.

He was appointed on the advice of Stephen Harper to the Senate on January 2, 2009, and sat as a Conservative Senator until May 2017, when Senate Leader Larry Smith removed him for his support for Senate reform proposals put forth by the governing Liberal Party. Greene then decided to sit as an \\"Independent Reform\\" Senator.  Early life and career  Greene was born in Montreal, Quebec. Greene served as Chief of Staff in the office of Reform Party of Canada leader Preston Manning for four years. He encouraged future Prime Minister Stephen Harper to run for the leadership of the Reform party's successor party, the Canadian Alliance. He was an unsuccessful Reform Party candidate in Halifax in the 1993 and 1997 federal elections. He then worked as the Executive Director of the Insurance Brokers Association of Nova Scotia. In the two years prior to his Senate appointment Greene was Principal Secretary and Deputy Chief of Staff to Nova Scotia Premier Rodney MacDonald.  Senate  Greene joined the Senate on January 2, 2009, after being appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In an interview with The Chronicle Herald after the appointment had been announced in 2008, Greene indicated that he wished to work on reforming the Senate. He served as Deputy Government Whip in the Senate from 2010 until June 2011, when he became the Vice Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport. In September 2011, Greene argued that if term limits were added for Senators, the mandatory retirement age of 75 should be removed, citing the case of Senator Vim Kochhar, who worked 14 hours days despite hitting the mandatory retirement age after only two years. In June 2012, the Senate Transport committee on which he was deputy chair issued \\"The Future of Canadian Air Travel: Toll Booth or Spark Plug?\\", a report which called on the government to stop requiring Canadian airports to pay rent, which was making them uncompetitive for Canadian flyers compared to American airports south of the border. In December 2012, Greene, along with Senators Mike Duffy from Prince Edward Island and John D. Wallace from New Brunswick, promoted the idea of Maritime Union, a proposal which would require amending the Constitution of Canada. In a speech to the Halifax West Conservative Riding Association, Greene argued that Maritime Union would reduce the inefficiencies in having multiple provincial governments and bureaucracies for a population one seventh the size of Ontario. Greene also argued that despite the similarities and shared history of the Maritimes, the \\"artificial\\" provincial barriers inhibit growth by competing for private sector money and imposing trade barriers on each other. On September 13, 2013, Greene left his position as Vice Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and became Deputy Government Whip again. In July 2015, Greene co-authored a report with Liberal Quebec Senator Paul Massicotte which argued that the Senate's \\"institutionalized partisanship\\" should end. After the 2015 federal election, Greene became the only Conservative to sponsor a government bill during the 42nd Canadian Parliament. sponsoring Bill S-4, which implemented double taxation deals with Taiwan and Israel, which was functionally similar to a bill Greene said he had sponsored during the Harper government. In 2016, Greene endorsed Maxime Bernier in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, and as of May 2017, was the Nova Scotia chair of his leadership campaign. Greene became Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate on March 7, 2016. In February 2017, Greene proposed an amendment to Bill S-2, a government bill on vehicle safety which would require automobile manufacturers to compensate dealers for unsold vehicles subject to recall. It was supported and incorporated into the Bill by a majority of the Senate. In March 2017, Greene unsuccessfully ran to succeed Claude Carignan as leader of the Senate Conservatives, losing to Larry Smith. A few days after his defeat, Greene was no longer the Deputy Opposition Whip. In May 2017, Smith told Greene that if he wished to remain in the Senate Conservatives, he could not accept a dinner invitation from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanking all Senators who had sponsored government legislation. According to Smith, Greene's votes at the Senate Modernization Committee in support of plans by Peter Harder, the Liberal government representative in the Senate, were too far out of line for a Conservative Senator because the reform would \\"effectively eliminate the Opposition.\\" According to Greene, he had offered to report to Smith about the government's plans for the Senate, but was rebuffed. Greene chose to leave caucus and sit as an \\"Independent Reform\\" Senator. Greene joined the Independent Senators Group on October 24, 2017 and left the Conservative Party of Canada. On November 4, 2019, he joined the Canadian Senators Group.

Oxford University  History and activities  In 2003, POWIC was built with donations from fthe Xylas shipping family, the late King of Saudi Arabia Fahd bin Abdel Aziz Al-Said, and the Sultan of Brunei. The building was formally opened by SANE‚Äôs Patron, The Prince of Wales in February 2003, although the scientific programme had been running for the previous nine years. Support for POWIC was encouraged by SANE's founder and chief executive Marjorie Wallace (SANE) CBE. Prior to the formation of SANE in 1986 there was a considerable paucity of research interest in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. One of the charity‚Äôs endeavors has been to initiate and fund research into the causes and treatments of mental illness. The Schizophrenia Forum In order to focus research efforts, SANE established POWIC in conjunction with the research psychiatrist Professor Tim Crow. Crow was appointed the honorary scientific director of SANE based at the Department of Psychiatry at Warneford Hospital, part of Oxford University. SANE raised ¬£3.5 million to establish centre on the Warneford Hospital site. The specially designed and purpose built centre includes office and laboratory space, as well as conference and library facilities. Aims The aims of POWIC are: * to establish the causes of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression * to become a central point for discussion in this field * to disseminate scientific information on mental illnesses.  Research  Crow has been studying schizophrenia for over 20 years, and he and his research group have been developing and researching a specific hypothesis about the origins of psychosis - that it is associated with the unique human capacity for language. Crow arrived at this hypothesis by bringing together the fact that schizophrenia only appears to occur in humans and not in our closest relatives, chimpanzees. The same can be said of brain asymmetry (the left and right sides of the brain, which are basically the same, being different in size). Brain asymmetry has been linked to the capacity for language. POWIC's quest for an organic basis for mental illness is pursued using three levels of explanation: * genetics - looking at the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees to find out about brain evolution, and genetic differences between individuals with schizophrenia and those without * neuropathology - the physical differences between the brains of those with schizophrenia and those without, such as regional brain volumes and cell density * neuroimaging and psychology - the relationship between brain structure on MRI scans and behaviour, in particular between brain asymmetry and language function. The Dalai Lama, who visited Oxford in 2008, gave his support to the new Centre and the scientific examination of the Mindfulness approach: \\"My primary concern is not to religion, but to benefit humanity. It is certainly right to use Buddhist techniques like mindfulness to alleviate suffering in this life.\\"  See also  * Mental health in the United Kingdom ReferencesExternal links *Centre website Category:Treatment of bipolar disorder Category:Bipolar disorder researchers Category:Mental health organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Psychiatric research institutes Category:Psychiatry in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Prince of Wales International Centre for SANE Research"},{"id":"20817742","text":"Huitzuco de los Figueroa is one of the 81 municipalities of Guerrero, in south-western Mexico.

Passau Hauptbahnhof was opened on 1 September 1861, with its first shed. It was initially a terminal station until the 1.5 km long section over the river Inn to Empress Elisabeth Railway from Wels on the Austrian side was taken into service. This now meant that railway traffic could now operate from Frankfurt am Main to Vienna via Passau. This border station was now operated by two separate railway companies and operating interest was generated by the changeover of locomotives there. In 1865 a railway link was built by a private railway company to the river port on the Danube next to Passau town hall. This was transferred to the Royal Bavarian State Railways on 1 January 1876. After the site had been extended several times over the course of the years and several branch lines had been taken into service, the Bahnbetriebswerk had to move to Haitzingerstra√üe in 1906. 150,000 m¬≤ of earth was moved and a twenty- road roundhouse with an adjoining two-road workshop was erected, together with a six-road workshop and traverser, which stamped its mark on the appearance of the site for 70 years. Because of the Obernzell to Wegscheid line, the only rack railway in the Royal Bavarian State Railways, new locomotives were constantly being tested at Bw Passau. The PtzL 3/4 (later DRG Class 97.1) was only ever stabled here; the first trials on the Uerdingen railbus, the VT 95, VT98.9 und VT97, took place here, as did testing for the road-rail vehicle and the V 100, which worked the line until the Class 213 (the variant for steep inclines, the V100.10) succeeded it. This depot has stabled numerous steam locomotives, but over time they were replaced by diesel or electric locos. After the closure of passenger services on several routes as well as the withdrawal of goods traffic and the dismantling of the Obernzell - Wegscheid line and the disbandment of the Regensburg railway division the depot was subordinated to the Nuremberg division. The departure of the locomotives to other depots began in the 1960s and was completed in 1978. The last modification took place in 1976 and saw the demolition of the roundhouse. In its place the present day Orange Shed, for the maintenance of railbuses, and a workshop were erected. After the depot was closed in 2000, the property was entrusted to a local railway society, the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde (PEF), who are housed on the site. The old Betriebswerk Passau can now only be seen as an H0 gauge model in the cellar of Passau Hauptbahnhof. The railway modelling section of the PEF had the aim of building a model with a historical background; as a result the depots of both the German and Austrian railways - the Deutsche Bundesbahn and √ñBB - are depicted as is Passau station and several neighbouring branch lines.

He is called the father of Greek water polo and he is the presently the longest serving president of an athletic federation in Europe. Early life He was born in Piraeus in 1947 to a middle-class family. In 1965 he entered the NUOA Law School of Athens and immediately he registered in Center's Union Party Youth branch. Two years later he was elected president of the Law School Students Union, just days before the beginning of the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974. During the seven years of the junta he was pursued due to his anti-dictatorship actions. By 1974 he became an early member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) that some years later came to power in Greece. First contact with sports From 1976 he started his career as a water polo referee. At that time water polo referees were paying their expenses out of their own pocket. From 1979 he started to work as a lawyer, while he continued his parallel career as a water polo referee, soon qualifying to work at the A1 Men's Category. He participated as a water polo referee at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He continued as an active member of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Party (PASOK). The road to presidency In 1984 the PASOK government decided to introduce reforms in Greek sports organization, as part of their general program of reforms. Diathessopoulos was chosen to work with swimmers; he formed a team of competitors. Some months later he won the Hellenic Swimming Federation (KOE) elections and began serving as its President. He still holds this post today with a brief break during 1991-1994, when the New Democracy party was in power in Greece. His work During Diathessopoulos' presidency, the Hellenic Swimming Federation developed rapidly and its sports (water polo, swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming) became popular among Greek youth. Successes include a silver medal that was won by women's water polo team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, which is the biggest Greek success in team sports, and a fourth- place finish by the men's water polo team at the Olympics, which is the biggest success of any Greek men's sports team. In 1987 Diathessopoulos was elected General Secretary of the Greek Olympic Committee (EOE), a position that he kept for over 17 years with brief breaks. He is a member of the administrative council of FINA, the international swimming federation. After many years as a member of their bureau, in 2008 he was elected vice-president of the European Swimming Federation (LEN). He was appointed as the highest officer for the development and administration of water polo in Europe. During his presidency of the Hellenic Swimming Federation (KOE) he worked hard to prevent attempts by the government to reduce its economic and moral support of sports, and he is considered a key player in the struggle against doping in Greece. He was involved in a dispute with the former Minister of Sports, Andreas Fouras, when Fouras attempted to pass legislation that reduced the state's financing of sports and included provisions that would allow the cancellation of any developments in Greek athletics. The affair ended with Foura's expulsion from office; Diathessopoulos was widely recognized for his efforts, which have discouraged any further attempts by the state to cut sports financing. Diathessopoulos is renowned for his actions towards the development of mass sports in Greece. With his protests, political initiatives, work on sports law, and even lawsuits against the Greek state, he has made an important contribution to the enactment of pro-sports developmental legislation. Several times he was considered as the national voice of the Greek sports community. He was a key player in Greece's failed attempt to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, and one of the architects of the successful 2004 Summer Olympics bid. He played an important role as a member of the organizing committee for the event, in cooperation with Gianna Aggelopoulou-Daskalaki. His political activism has brought him the attention of the Greek press on many occasions. Other political work Diathessopoulos has kept involved in the Greek political scene. He was elected as president of the Perfectorial Councilor of Athens District from 1994 to 1998. He holds several important offices within PASOK, as a member of its National Committee and a leading member of the committee that directs the party's sports policy. In 2000 he was proposed for the office of General Secretary of Sports in Greece under the Ministry of Culture, but he rejected the offer, as he preferred to pursue a career within international swimming organizations. Future plans Dimitris Diathessopoulos was reelected recently to his offices and he is not planning to leave the KOE's Presidency soon. He was elected a member of the FINA Bureau and supreme officer for water polo throughout the world. His son Michael (Michail) Diathessopoulos, also an attorney at law and a Cambridge scholar, follows the steps of his father, with involvement in politics. He is a member of the National Committee of PASOK and is a leader in PASOK's Youth Organization. Dimitrios Diathessopoulos hopes his son will one day follow in his footsteps as president of the Hellenic Swimming Federation.

Background With the dawn of the new decade, Nelson had not achieved the commercial success at RCA that he had hoped for. He gained a measure of fame writing songs that were hits for Faron Young (\\"Hello Walls\\"), Billy Walker (\\"Funny How Time Slips Away\\"), Patsy Cline (\\"Crazy\\"), and Roy Orbison (\\"Pretty Paper\\"), but most of his singles stalled on the charts, his biggest single at RCA being the Vegas-styled cover \\"Bring Me Sunshine,\\" which hit number 13. His producer, RCA head Chet Atkins, had tried various approaches, from a live LP to a Texas-themed concept album, but success remained elusive. After the underwhelming performance of the album My Own Peculiar Way, a year passed before the November 1969 sessions began for Both Sides Now. Recording and composition As he had in the past, Atkins turned production duties on Nelson over to Felton Jarvis, who had started producing Elvis Presley. Unlike Atkins, Jarvis let Nelson record on his own terms and bring along Billy English, Paul English's nineteen-year-old brother, on drums, David Zettner on guitar and bass, Shirley Nelson on vocals (her last collaboration with her husband), and Jimmy Day on bass. The album contains a new version of \\"I Gotta Get Drunk,\\" a song Nelson wrote in Houston before moving to Nashville in 1960, as well as \\"Bloody Mary Morning,\\" a tune destined to become a highlight in the Texan's live shows. In his 2015 autobiography, Nelson admitted the song was taken from his own unhappy experiences as a drinker: :\\"Bloody Mary Morning\\" was another boozy song about this boozy period of my life. Its origins might be found in those days on the road when I was living a double life...I was a lousy drunk, a foolish drunk, a fighting drunk, a drunk who did himself much damage. But I was caught up in the culture of drinking. That's what country singers did, right? That's what pickers did. That was the life. Both Sides Now contains the country standards \\"Wabash Cannonball\\" and \\"Crazy Arms,\\" but what is most striking about the collection is the inclusion of material far beyond the confines of Nashville, as Streissguth notes: \\"Willie's own songs were as pleasing as ever, at home in a coffeehouse or a honky-tonk, but now they appeared next to his covers of other great songs of the day: Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now,' Fred Neil's 'Everybody's Talkin','...a perfect alignment of stars in early 1970s Nashville: the seasoned singer and the blossoming songwriters shone brightly.\\" Nelson's broad range and musical tastes, already evident in his Django Reinhardt-inspired guitar playing and jazz-inflected singing, were attuned to the new songwriters of the day, with the singer later commenting, \\"Well, I did sing Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now' and...James Taylor's 'Fire and Rain,' not because I wanted to reinvent myself in the folk medium, but only because I really liked the songs.\\" Going completely against the grain of country music's traditionally right-wing conservative stance, he also identified with the hippie culture: \\"I liked that they put flowers in their hair and wore bright tie-dyed blouses and bell-bottomed pants. I liked that they had the courage to look and act any damn way they pleased.\\" Nelson sounded just as at ease singing folk-rock as he did singing ballads and western swing, with Jim Worbois of AllMusic declaring, \\"Listening to \\"Everybody's Talkin',\\" you don't find yourself longing for Nilsson's version.\\" Session player Norbert Putnam led one session and added bass while James Isbell played bongos to convey the folkie vibe Nelson was going after. Reception AllMusic: \\"The title track aside, this is a pretty good album. While there aren't as many originals on this record as some of his albums released around this time, he manages to get something new out of several of his covers.\\" Track listing #\\"Crazy Arms\\" (Ralph Mooney, Charles Seals) #\\"Wabash Cannonball\\" (A.P.

Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth of Nations have had a controversial and stormy diplomatic relationship. Zimbabwe is a former member of the Commonwealth, having withdrawn in 2003, and the issue of Zimbabwe has repeatedly taken centre stage in the Commonwealth, both since Zimbabwe's independence and as part of the British Empire. Zimbabwe was the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, gaining responsible government in 1923. Southern Rhodesia became one of the most prosperous, and heavily settled, of the UK's African colonies, with a system of white minority rule. Southern Rhodesia was integrated into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In response to demands for greater black African power in government, the anti-federation white nationalist Rhodesian Front (RF) was elected in 1962, leading to the collapse of federation. The RF, under the leadership of Ian Smith from 1964, rejected the principle of NIBMAR that the Commonwealth demanded, and the Southern Rhodesian government, now styling itself 'Rhodesia', issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. The United Kingdom refused to recognise this, and the Commonwealth was at the forefront of rejecting the UDI, imposing sanctions on Rhodesia, ending the break-away, and bringing about Rhodesia's final independence under black majority rule as Zimbabwe in 1980. However, differences of opinion of how to approach Rhodesia exposed structural and philosophical weaknesses that threatened to break-up the Commonwealth. In recent years, under the presidency of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe has dominated Commonwealth affairs, creating acrimonious splits in the organisation. Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 for breaching the Harare Declaration. In 2003, when the Commonwealth refused to lift the suspension, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth. Since then, the Commonwealth has played a major part in trying to end the political impasse and return Zimbabwe to a state of normality. Early historyTowards responsible government= Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia from 1901, having been colonised by the British South Africa Company (BSAC), headed by Cecil Rhodes. Southern Rhodesia first became a central issue in the Commonwealth in 1910, upon the creation of the Union of South Africa. The South Africa Act 1909 made provisions for the accession of both Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia) to join the union. This was one of three popular options, but actively discouraged by the BSAC, which preferred union with Northern Rhodesia.Wood (2005), p. 8 This was actively pursued by the BSAC administration, under Leander Starr Jameson and Francis Chaplin, as a means of countering an Afrikaner-dominated South Africa. In the election of March 1914, BSAC-supported candidates (as opposed to supporters of self-government) won twelve of the thirteen elected seats in the Legislative Council. However, when the charter came up for renewal in August of the same year, it was granted only on condition that further political rights were extended: pushing the territory towards self-government. Furthermore, in 1918, the Privy Council ruled that the BSAC did not own any unalienated land. Now being unable to sell land, it decided against investing any further in the colony, but advocated incorporation into South Africa, which would be able to compensate its shareholders. This, however, was unpopular amongst settlers, who, in the 1920 election, elected ten representatives of the Responsible Government Association. Persuaded of its popular support, Colonial Secretary Viscount Milner formed a commission to investigate, and this commission, the Buxton Commission, ruled that the two options ‚Äì union with South Africa and responsible government ‚Äì be put to a referendum. Union was rejected by the Southern Rhodesian people, who voted in the 1922 referendum in favour responsible government, which was granted in 1923. =A status of its own= The European appearance of Southern Rhodesia's capital Salisbury (pictured here in 1930; now called Harare) reinforced the settlers' belief that Southern Rhodesia deserved to be a dominion, on a par with South Africa. Southern Rhodesia had been granted a great deal of autonomy, including powers over defence and constitutional amendment,Wood (2005), p. 9 but falling short of dominionhood. However, observers would be forgiven for thinking that Rhodesia had just become the eighth dominion (as, indeed, reported Time magazine). Southern Rhodesian Premiers were routinely invited to Imperial Conferences of dominions' Prime Ministers from 1932 onwards; and, when the Dominions Office was created in 1925, Rhodesia was the only non-dominion to fall under its remit, in recognition of its quasi-independent status. Indeed, the government of Southern Rhodesian itself was under the same misapprehension. Its official position, which it would hold until UDI, was that Southern Rhodesia was already a member of the Commonwealth, albeit not a dominion. When Robert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia, found in 1963 that Jack Howman thought that Southern Rhodesia 'is and always has been a member of the Commonwealth', this caused a diplomatic spat that contributed to the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Nonetheless, Southern Rhodesia did recognise that it had limits on its self-government. For example, foreign relations were not maintained, nor could the government change the Southern Rhodesian pound from parity against the British pound sterling. The most important derogation was on racial affairs; laws related to racial affairs were to have Royal Assent withheld. However, despite these limits, and the formal supremacy of British statutes under the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, a convention emerged that Parliament would not legislate for Southern Rhodesia, nor the Governor withhold Assent, without the Legislative Assembly's permission. The threat of intervention may have achieved some successes, such as when the Rhodesian government attempted to ban native Africans from voting outright in 1934, but these were few and far between.Louis et al. (1999), p. 552‚Äì3 The result is that, even though self-government had been tailored to avoid the creation of a system that subjugated the native population, it happened anyway: directly against the zeitgeist of the rest of the Empire at the time. =Bledisloe Commission= Discussions returned on the further integration of Southern Rhodesia with surrounding colonies. Plans to amalgamate with Northern Rhodesia had been rejected by the settler population in 1916 on the grounds that merger with its less developed neighbour would delay self-government. However, when the Hilton Young Commission recommended in 1929 an even wider union, encompassing both central and eastern Africa, a Rhodesian union became the lesser of two evils, and jumped upon. In the face of this opposition to the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission, in 1935, Viscount Bledisloe (newly departed Governor-General of New Zealand) was asked to evaluate the future of cooperation and combination of the colonies of central Africa.Louis et al. (1999), p. 270 The government required him to take into account the 'interests of the inhabitants, irrespective of race'. Taking four years to report, and acquiring the nickname 'Viscount Bloody-slow' for this, Bledisloe concluded that there was a single barrier to political integration: Southern Rhodesia's racist legislation. Under the doctrine of non-interference that had been established, this was seen as insurmountable, putting off any political integration, yet allowing for the economic integration that Bledisloe recommended as feasible. =Southern Rhodesia in the Second World War= Southern Rhodesia attempted to show its loyalty to, and independence of, the mother country by symbolically becoming the first colony to affirm the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939 (like other colonies, as well as Australia and New Zealand, which had not ratified the Statute of Westminster, it had no power to declare war itself). It is often reported that a greater proportion of the population of Southern Rhodesia served in the war than of any other part of the Empire. Even though this has become a part of nationalist folklore, this is to include only the White population (of whom, 15% served), and not the population as a whole (of whom, 2% served). Nonetheless, there developed a nationalist perception that the UK and its empire owed the Southern Rhodesians a debt: which continued right up until the late 1970s. During the war, Southern Rhodesia benefited from the 'lucrativeness of loyalty', by hosting several bases of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Even though there were no established training facilities before the war, shortly after outbreak, Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins offered to raise three air squadrons, initiating a dialogue that led to the United Kingdom offering a blank cheque to train as many pilots and air crew as Southern Rhodesia could manage. In total, 10,107 service personnel, including 7,730 pilots, were trained in Southern Rhodesia under the plan. The construction and operation of the bases (paid for mostly by the UK and Canada), as well as the location of thousands of service personnel in the colony, boosted the war-time economy of Southern Rhodesia dramatically. Higgins estimated that the training camps were as important to the war-time economy as the gold-mining industry. Central African FederationDeliberations= The Central African Federation ‚Äì incorporating Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland ‚Äì was designed as a buffer state to Afrikaner-dominated South Africa. Click here to enlarge map. In 1945, a Central African Council was formed as a consultative body for the three British central African territories: Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland (present-day Malawi). This was the limit of the British wish for integration: fearful for the same reasons Bledisloe had been. However, the conversion in July 1948 of the Northern Rhodesian settler leadership, under Roy Welensky, to supporting federalism (from long-held support for amalgamation) promoted London to reconsider its position. When Welensky held talks with the Southern Rhodesia leadership at Victoria Falls, he agreed a wide-ranging agreement that, far from loose federalism, seemed more a plot to amalgamate under white Rhodesian leadership. This would be a recurring theme, firstly in April 1950, as a vicious circle of patently unacceptable Rhodesian proposals were made and flatly refused: potentially alienating the promise of resolution, hence pushing white settlers towards South Africa. The official visit of Gordon Walker to the region in early 1951 was the turning point for the United Kingdom. Startled by the strength of pro-South African support in Salisbury, Walker's report made it clear that, spurned, Southern Rhodesia could turn to outright revolt, as 'potential American colonies ‚Äì very loyal, but very determined to have their own way'. This, it was feared, would lead to a cataclysmic war between settler-dominated south and east Africa and native- dominated west Africa: ripping apart the nascent Commonwealth. Coupled with the Baxter report from a conference of officials, the report to the cabinet stated unequivocally: \\"[federation is] urgently desirable in the interests of the territories (including those of the African inhabitants) and of the Commonwealth.\\" It has been suggested that the main impetus for the British fear of South African domination of central Africa was to avoid South Africa cornering the market in various raw materials: including gold, chrome, and uranium. =Forming a federation= The Federation would be 'the most controversial large-scale imperial exercise in constructive state-building ever untaken by the British government'. =Towards independence?Collapse=Rhodesia after UDIUnilateral Declaration of Independence= But for the likely hostile reaction from the rest of the Commonwealth, and hence a threat to its very existence, it is probable that the British government would have accepted an independent Southern Rhodesia upon the death of the Federation in 1963. However, the preservation of the Commonwealth was the predominant concern of the British government, and thus persevered with the gradual introduction of black majority rule to Rhodesia to avoid being forced to 'choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth' (in Harold Macmillan's words). The 1964 Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was the first held after the collapse of the federation, and, even though federal Prime Ministers had attended during federation, and Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers had before federation, this invitation was not extended to Prime Minister Ian Smith. This was seen as the utmost slight, particularly as newly independent Malawi ‚Äì Southern Rhodesia's former federal partner ‚Äì was in attendance. Before federation, the Southern Rhodesian government had attended every meeting since 1932, and its official position was that it was already a member of the Commonwealth, hence entitled to attend as a matter of right. On 11 November 1965, Smith issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). =Commonwealth reaction= On the day of UDI, the United Kingdom imposed the most stringent financial and economic constraints it had imposed upon any country (including Egypt during the Suez Crisis) since the Second World War. In vetoing loans to Rhodesia from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other institutions; imposing a trade embargo on arms, sugar, and tobacco; making it harder for Rhodesians to access London financial markets than the Soviet Union; and removing Commonwealth Preference, the British government was seen to have done everything possible to punish Rhodesia economically, except to impose an oil embargo, which was itself forthcoming on 17 December 1965. This was not enough to placate some Commonwealth members, who demanded a military response. Two, Ghana and Tanzania, even suspended diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom as a reaction to the United Kingdom's refusal to use military force to oust Smith. An emergency Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers convened in Lagos, Nigeria (the only one held outside London) on 10 January 1966 to address the crisis. At this meeting, Wilson pledged that sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth would bring the crisis to an end 'within a matter of weeks, not months'. However, on 14 January, Wilson stated that military intervention could not be ruled out, and, on 25 January, also stated that there would be no negotiations with the Rhodesian administration except on how to bring about an orderly return to direct rule. =Negotiate or not?= The 1966 full Prime Ministers' Meeting, held in September, saw the Commonwealth as a whole close to collapse, as African members suspected that the UK was on the verge of breaking its pledges not to negotiate over the issue of NIBMAR. Nonetheless, despite Harold Wilson describing it 'by common consent, the worst ever held up to that time', the meeting passed without cataclysm, but led to a hiatus in PM meetings until 1969 (at the behest of Wilson, and opposed by Arnold Smith). Meanwhile, the UK had been conducting exploratory talks with the Rhodesian government, aboard (in 1966) and (1968) that led to Rhodesia declining very favourable terms. Similarly favourable terms were proposed in 1971, but discarded when the British government determined that they were largely rejected by the African population. However, this movement towards negotiation and appeasement of the Salisbury regime was turned on its head over the following two years, thanks in no small part to pressure from the Commonwealth. The Singapore Declaration, issued at the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, articulated the political principles of the Commonwealth, including the elimination of racial discrimination. With the incorporation of this implicit commitment to opposing Rhodesia into the Commonwealth's aims, and the increasingly disparity of British economic interests in Africa, the UK chose the Commonwealth over Rhodesia. =Beginning of the end= The hardening of the United Kingdom's line came as part of a wave of bad news for the Rhodesian regime. The Carnation Revolution in Portugal led to the end of Portuguese assistance from Mozambique, and, in its place, put an independent Mozambique with a left-wing government, which was eager to aid guerillas from Rhodesia. South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster attempted d√©tente with the newly independent Angolan and Mozambican governments, and, believing a stable majority-governed country to be in South Africa's interests, persuaded Ian Smith that white minority rule could not continue forever in Rhodesia. All this brought Rhodesia to the negotiating table with moderate African leaders, leading to the Internal Settlement under which Rhodesia became Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Commonwealth flatly refused to recognise Rhodesia-Zimbabwe, and did not lift its sanctions. At the 1979 CHOGM, the Heads of Government issued the Lusaka Declaration, once again committing itself to ending racial discrimination. The official communiqu√© of the meeting invited Rhodesia-Zimbabwe's new Prime Minister Abel Muzorewa and Ian Smith to a constitutional convention with the leading guerilla leaders, giving rise to the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979. =Ceasefire and independence= The agreement demanded a ceasefire, reverted Rhodesia back into the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, with full control from London, and paved the way for an election in 1980. To implement the Lancaster House Agreement, at the behest of Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal and Kenneth Kaunda (and in the face of opposition from Lord Carrington), the Commonwealth created the Commonwealth Monitoring Force (CMF). This included 1,097 Britons, as well as representatives of Australia, Canada, Fiji, Kenya, and New Zealand, totalling 1,548 service personnel. They organised ceasefire assembly places, at which guerillas could disarm and reintegrate into their communities in time for the election. Observers expected the operation to fail, as the composition and swiftness of deployment seemed to fly in the face of convention wisdom. Nonetheless, it succeeded in maintaining peace, demilitarising the militia and guerillas, and presiding over a peaceful election that election observers deemed free and fair. The resounding victory of Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF in March 1980 led to Southern Rhodesia's independence as the Republic of Zimbabwe later that year. Upon independence, Zimbabwe joined the Commonwealth: five decades after Southern Rhodesia's government had mistakenly believed that it had in the wake of its invitation to the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference. The end of the Rhodesian crisis was a victory for Commonwealth principles, and their application to the policies of a member: in this case, the United Kingdom itself. Shridath Ramphal played a vital role in the affair, whilst it was the 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that played host to the deliberations and resolutions of the crisis, and a Commonwealth military force that kept the peace. For its part, Mozambique was recognised as a 'cousin state' of the Commonwealth, and was rewarded for its opposition to the Rhodesian regime with accession to the Commonwealth in 1995: becoming the only member without direct constitutional links to another. Zimbabwe under MugabeZimbabwe and the Harare Declaration= In recent times, Zimbabwe has dominated the agendas of most Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGMs). President Robert Mugabe's government is accused of abusing human rights, rigging elections, undermining the Zimbabwean economy. The matters his Government is accused of contravene the basic principles of the Commonwealth, as outlined in the Harare Declaration, issued at the 1991 CHOGM in (ironically enough) Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. After the Zimbabwean people rejected Mugabe's proposed new constitution in a February 2000 referendum, the situation deteriorated rapidly, as violence against opponents increased. To address these issues, in September 2001, Zimbabwe sent a delegation to meet with the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which is responsible for upholding the Harare Declaration. Zimbabwe promised to end the violence and defend human rights, as required of them as Commonwealth members, but failed to do so. As a result, the United Kingdom pushed to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. This has been characterised by Mugabe, and South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a neo-colonial campaign, but this is derided as ungrounded revionism and racist itself. =Initial 12-month suspension= The 2002 CHOGM was delayed in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, but Zimbabwe was still top of the agenda. On 4 March 2002 the CHOGM statement issued at Coolum, Australia implicitly rejected calls by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for punitive action to be taken against Zimbabwe for alleged violence and intimidation surrounding the Presidential Election Campaign. CHOGM, instead, \\"expressed their deep concern\\", and called on all parties to work together \\"to create an atmosphere in which there could be a free and fair election\\". CHOGM also ‚Äúnoted that a Commonwealth Observer Group would report to the Commonwealth Secretary-General immediately after the Zimbabwe presidential election of 9‚Äì10 March 2002‚Äù and confirmed their agreement to:The Commonwealth at the Summit ‚Äì Communiques of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings 1997 ‚Äì 2005, Commonwealth Secretariat 2007 Shortly after the presidential election had concluded, the Report of the Commonwealth Observer Group was submitted to the Troika.The Report of the Commonwealth Observer Group, Commonwealth Secretariat Even the Government of Zimbabwe concedes that its conclusions were ‚Äúadverse‚Äù. On 19 March 2002 the Troika, being the competent Commonwealth body, suspended Zimbabwe for a 12-month period. The Zimbabwe government disputes that there were legitimate grounds for its suspension. Zimbabwe considers that the CHOGM statement only permitted the Troika to go beyond an expression of collective disapproval if something adverse was reported on in the Commonwealth Observer Group Report pertaining to the period after the CHOGM statement issued and ending at the time when the voting in the election ended (7 days in total). The Zimbabwe government considers that although adverse findings were contained in the Report, none of them related to that period and therefore the Troika did not have competence to suspend it from the Commonwealth. =Purported further suspension= Unlike all other previous Commonwealth country suspensions, Zimbabwe's was for a definite period of 12 months. In the case of a suspension for a finite period there is no need for such a suspension to be lifted. It automatically lapses unless it is renewed or extended. The Zimbabwe Government and the Southern Africa Development Community contend that this therefore meant that in the absence of a renewal or extension, Zimbabwe's suspension by the Troika would automatically lapse on 19 March 2003. A split emerged in the Troika. Australia was in favour of a further suspension. South Africa and Nigeria (i.e. the majority of the Troika) were not. Indeed, the Zimbabwe Government points to the letter dated 10 February 2003 from the President of Nigeria to the Prime Minister of Australia in which he stated ‚Äúthat the time is now auspicious to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe with regard to her suspension from the Commonwealth Councils.‚Äù According to the Zimbabwe Government, the President of South Africa also contacted the Prime Minister of Australia to convey the same message. Notwithstanding that there had been no Troika decision, on 12 February 2003, the Prime Minister of Australia and the Secretary General of the Commonwealth announced that Zimbabwe would remain suspended until the next CHOGM in December 2003. This ‚Äúpurported‚Äù further suspension was disputed by the other members of the Troika and Zimbabwe for the reasons described above. Moreover, the Southern African Development Community formally confirmed its position that Zimbabwe's one-year suspension had lapsed on 19 March 2003. This was reaffirmed at a meeting of the troika of the SADC Organ for Politics, Defence and Security ‚Äî namely Lesotho (chair), Mozambique and South Africa, with Zimbabwe invited ‚Äî in Pretoria in late November 2003. Final suspension and Zimbabwe‚Äôs withdrawal Failing to get Mugabe to meet with the opposition MDC Morgan Tsvangirai, Chairperson-to-be Obasanjo refused to invite Mugabe to the CHOGM. The rest of the CHOGM's deliberations on Zimbabwe were marked by the same African disunity, foiling Mbeki's repeated attempts to have Zimbabwe readmitted. Ultimately he CHOGM rejected the Mbeki led minority group and implicitly rejected the views of the majority of the Troika that Zimbabwe's suspension had already terminated. Instead, the CHOGM statement (tabled by Canada and Kenya) treated Zimbabwe as a country that was still suspended and determined to continue its suspension for an indefinite period, appointing a six-member panel to advise on the way forward. The committee, composed of the Heads of Government of South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, Jamaica, Australia, and Canada, ruled by six-to- one (South Africa being the one) against lifting Zimbabwe's suspension. Following the CHOGM, the SADC (supported by Uganda) issued a statement in which it expressed deep concern at what it called the ‚Äòdismissive, intolerant and rigid attitude‚Äô shown by some Commonwealth members toward Zimbabwe. SADC has consistently pleaded for greater patience and understanding of Zimbabwe, and cautioned against lecturing and hectoring.SADC Barometer, January 2004 edition A separate and not directly related matter at the CHOGM was an attempt by Mbeki to oust Secretary-General Don McKinnon, who was up for election but whom convention dictated should not be challenged. However, only seven (of eighteen) African Heads of Government voted for Mbeki's candidate (along with the four South Asian countries), Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar, allowing McKinnon to win by 40 votes to 11. =Zimbabwe withdraws and reaction= In an official letter to the Commonwealth Secretariat dated 11 December 2003, Zimbabwe formally terminated with effect from 7 December 2003 its membership in the Commonwealth. This confirmed President Mugabe's decision to leave the organisation following the CHOGM statement issued in Nigeria, which indefinitely suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. On 19 November 2003, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe made a detailed statement on the whole affair to the Parliament of Zimbabwe.Parliament of Zimbabwe, 19 November 2003 (Hansard) The withdrawal marked only the third occasion (after South Africa in 1961 and Pakistan in 1971) that a country had withdrawn voluntarily, although Ireland had voluntarily declared itself a republic in 1949 thereby ending its membership. =Since Zimbabwe's withdrawal= The next CHOGM, held in Abuja, Nigeria, in December 2003, was once more dominated by the Zimbabwe crisis. Failing to get Mugabe to meet with the opposition MDC Morgan Tsvangirai, Chairperson-to-be Obasanjo refused to invite Mugabe to the CHOGM. At the CHOGM, Mbeki attempted to oust Secretary-General Don McKinnon, who was up for election but whom convention dictated should not be challenged. However, only seven (of eighteen) African Heads of Government voted for Mbeki's candidate (along with the four South Asian countries), Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar, allowing McKinnon to win by 40 votes to 11. The rest of the CHOGM's deliberations on Zimbabwe were marked by the same African disunity, foiling Mbeki's repeated attempts to have Zimbabwe readmitted. To resolve the impasse, Canada and Kenya proposed a committee to resolve the issue of whether to lift Zimbabwe's suspension. The committee, composed of the Heads of Government of South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, Jamaica, Australia, and Canada, ruled by six-to-one (South Africa being the one) against lifting Zimbabwe's suspension. In response, Robert Mugabe announced on 7 December that Zimbabwe was withdrawing from the Commonwealth: marking only the third occasion (after South Africa in 1961 and Pakistan in 1971) that a country had withdrawn voluntarily. British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary David Miliband and outgoing Secretary-General Don McKinnon both expressed their approval of Zimbabwe's return to the Commonwealth if the country resolved its infringements of the Harare Declaration, especially under a new government. Mugabe has stated that Zimbabwe would never rejoin the Commonwealth, calling it an 'evil organisation'. Before the 2008 parliamentary election, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, whose party won the vote, announced that, under his leadership, Zimbabwe would seek a return to the Commonwealth. It has been compared to South Africa's withdrawal in 1961, on the occasion of which Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker said that there would always be a 'candle in the window' until South Africa returned: the reentry of Zimbabwe would vindicate the Commonwealth's moral commitment to the Zimbabwean people and its principles. Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe in late 2017 has indicated that Zimbabwe may return to the Commonwealth in time for the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, following The Gambia's return to the Commonwealth under Adama Barrow on 8 February 2018, and The Gambia's return to the Commonwealth Games Federation on 31 March 2018. On May 15, 2018, Mnangagwa submitted an application to rejoin the Commonwealth. In February 2019, Harriett Baldwin, Minister of State for Africa & International Development, said: \\"As of today, the UK would not be able to support this application because we don‚Äôt believe that the kinds of human rights violations that we are seeing from security forces in Zimbabwe are the kind of behaviour that you would expect to see from a Commonwealth country.\\" In retaliation, Mnangagwa mentioned in an interview with French TV news channel France 24 that: \\"The Commonwealth has never told us that they are not considering our application. The view of one member is not the view of the Commonwealth\\".

Posner (; born November 19, 1950) is an American lawyer, the Founding Executive Director and later the President of Human Rights First (formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), the former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) of the United States, currently a Co-Director for the Center of Business and Human Rights at NYU Stern School of Business, as well as Professor of Business and Society at New York University Stern School of Business, and a Board member of the International Service for Human Rights.  Early years  Posner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received a B.A. from the University of Michigan. He received his J.D. from the University of California, Berkeley Law School (Boalt Hall). He is a member of the California Bar (inactive)State Bar of California Membership Records and the Illinois Bar.Illinois Supreme Court Attorney Registration After graduating, Posner spent a year documenting atrocities committed in Uganda. His work in Geneva for the United Nations earned him esteem as a human-rights advocate.Who Run's Government Biography  Michael Posner  Human Rights First  In 1978, Posner was recruited by Jerome Shestack and James Silkenat to become the founding executive director of the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights, a non-profit, nonpartisan international human rights organization with offices in New York and Washington, D.C. that works on a range of domestic and international human rights issues. He focused on refugee protection, advancing a rights-based approach to national security and combating discrimination. The organization was renamed to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and, in 2003, renamed again to Human Rights First. In his role, Posner built the organization from a staff of two, a few volunteers and a budget of $55,000 to its current staff of 60 and an annual budget of almost $9 million.Human Rights First 2007 Annual Report =Torture Victim Protection Act= Posner has also focused efforts to strengthen systems of accountability in countries where human rights violations occur, especially for crimes like torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. He proposed, drafted, and campaigned for the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), which was adopted by Congress and signed into law in 1992.Testimony Before the U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, 22 June 1990. =WITNESS= Also in 1992, Posner helped musician/activist Peter Gabriel found WITNESS, an organization that uses video and online technologies to shed light on human rights violations around the world. In its first few years, WITNESS was based at Human Rights First. WITNESS has since received numerous awards for their work including, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Humanitarian Award and The New York Times Company Nonprofit Excellence Award. =Role in the International Justice System and the International Criminal Court (ICC)= In 1998, Posner led the Human Rights First delegation to the Rome conference at which the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted.http://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and- events/biography/michael-posner =McCain Amendment / End Torture Now Campaign= Human Rights First launched its End Torture Now campaign in 2004. Posner and Human Rights First led the advocacy efforts in support of the McCain Amendment which bans U.S. soldiers and officials from engaging in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The amendment won broad bipartisan congressional support and was signed into law in December 2005.Michael Posner  Human Rights First Academic career Posner lectured at Yale Law School from 1981 to 1984, and again in 2009, and at Columbia Law School between 1984 and 2008. Human rights advocacy Posner has testified dozens of times before the U.S. Congress on a wide range of human rights topics including the protection of refugees, anti-Semitism, human rights within the business communityTestimony Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressional Human Rights Caucus, 8 February 2006 and human rights violations in the Philippines,Testimony Before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, 18 September 1984 China,Testimony Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on International Relations, 20 January 1999 Northern Ireland,Testimony Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on International Relations, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 24 June 1997 Uganda,Testimony Before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy, February 1978 El Salvador and many other countries. He is a frequent public commentator on these and other issues, regularly speaking at conferences and events in the United States and abroad. His opinion essays have appeared in publications including the Boston Globe,\\"The Rule of Law\\", Boston Globe, 18 July 2006 Jerusalem Post\\"A Dangerous Continuum\\", Jerusalem Post, 26 December 2007 Washington Post,\\"Another chance for Egypt to commit to transparency\\", Washington Post, 18 December 2010 and International Herald Tribune.\\"Anti- Semitism in Europe\\", International Herald Tribune, 5 May 2004 Obama Administration On July 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Posner to serve in the State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. He was named to the position on September 23, 2009. =Confirmation= In his statement as the nominee for Assistant Secretary of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 28, 2009, Posner affirmed that > [s}ince the late 1970s, I often have looked to the U.S. government as a key > ally in the struggle to protect human rights around the world. As a non- > governmental advocate, I have witnessed and often benefited from the > incredible power and moral authority of the United States to lead on these > important but often complicated issues. The U.S. government's potential to > provide leadership on human rights democracy and the rule of law is part of > what Secretary Clinton has referred to as the smart power. Posner later recalled the personal lessons of the Holocaust that helped shape his vocation as a human rights advocate. Posner was raised with a consciousness of the horrors of the Holocaust and \\"internalized two important lessons. The first is that governments that fall into the hands of dictators and demagogues are capable of unspeakable brutality and horror. The second, more hopeful lesson is that courageous people can and often do stand up to oppression and it is our duty to help them\\".Michael H. Posner, \\" Testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\\" During his testimony, Posner gave a brief synopsis of his previous involvement with the U.S. government in their mutual effort to promote and protect human rights. His first appearance before the Senate was in 1978 when Posner testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the trade sanctions against Idi Amin's Uganda. Posner commented that \\"this was the first of many instances where I have seen and been part of efforts to harness the political, diplomatic and economic power of the United States Government as a force for good\\". Congress passed a total ban on trade with Uganda and the people regained control of their country within the year. He went on to describe other shared successes including \\"the work we did with Andrei Sakharov and other dissidents in the former Soviet Union, especially through the Helsinki process. I experienced it in the 1980s when President Reagan stood behind Philippine \\"people's power\\" and ensured a successful transition of power from Marcos to Aquino. I saw it in Northern Ireland where George Mitchell and the Clinton Administration provided a roadmap for peace through the Good Friday Agreement. And I witnessed it as the Bush Administration, working closely with Congressional leaders like Senators Cardin and Voinovich and Congressman Chris Smith, took a leading role in challenging European anti-Semitism and other racial and religious persecution through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\". Posner closed with an affirmation that \\"[t]he promotion of democracy and human rights here, and around the world, helps define us ‚Äì and who we are as a people\\". Posner's confirmation by the 111th Congress was welcomed by the international human rights community. Amnesty International USA Executive Director Larry Cox issued the following statement: \\"Michael has been a brilliant advocate on behalf of protecting the rights and dignity of people the world over. At this time of great opportunity to advance the rights of those whose freedoms are denied, it is invaluable to have an advocate of Michael's accomplishment in this role\\", said Cox. \\"Amnesty International looks forward to continuing to work with now-Secretary Posner on crucial issues concerning the global protection of human rights for all people\\". At his Swearing-in Ceremony at the State Department, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton commented that \\"as soon as [his confirmation] was completed, literally, he was on a plane, going to lead the first ever U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Council. Our team there under Mike's leadership not only made significant progress on women's rights and human security issues, but co- sponsored a successful resolution with Egypt upholding freedom of expression and freedom of religion. And Mike went on to Warsaw to present the Obama Administration's proposal for advancing the \\"Human Dimension\\" of the Helsinki process. I think I only talked to him two times during that period, because I had great confidence that he would indeed be successful as we rejoined the Human Rights Council and it exceeded our expectations\\".Remarks at Swearing-in Ceremony  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton =U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue= In May 2010, Posner was a key negotiator in a \\"U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue\\" in Washington, D.C. On May 14, Posner gave the press conference after the event, where he described the U.S. approach to the meeting as, \\"Part of a mature relationship is that you have an open discussion where you not only raise the other guy's problems, but you raise your own.\\" To that end, he said the American side had brought up the United States' \\"treatment of Muslim Americans\\", as well as Arizona's recently passed Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, which Posner said had been brought up \\"early and often\\", \\"as a troubling trend in our society\\".Briefing on the U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue (transcript), Michael H. Posner, May 14, 2010 Posner's comments proved controversial in the United States. Arizona's two senators, Republicans Jon Kyl and John McCain, wrote an open letter to Posner that stated, \\"To compare in any way the lawful and democratic act of the government of the state of Arizona with the arbitrary abuses of the unelected Chinese Communist Party is inappropriate and offensive\\", and called for a retraction and apology.\\"US senators blast Arizona-China rights comparison\\", Agence France-Presse, May 18, 2010 The conservative New York Post called the comments \\"misguided moral equivalence\\" and \\"despicable\\", citing China's treatment of its own Muslim population, the Uyghurs, as well as its policy of sending back refugees who arrive from North Korea, \\"where certain, agonizing death awaits them\\".\\"Maligning America‚ÄîAgain\\", editorial, New York Post, May 18, 2010. The State Department defended Posner's actions. Spokesman P. J. Crowley disputed the notion Posner was apologizing to China when he was actually \\"standing up\\" for America by demonstrating how debate works in a \\"civil society\\". Crowley also reiterated the Obama administration's concerns about the Arizona law, stating, \\"There is, as many have said, real concerns about -- that this Arizona law will inevitably devolve into racial profiling. That would be a fundamental challenge to human rights around the world\\". =Internet freedom= As Assistant Secretary of State, Posner has played a leading role in implementing Secretary Clinton's vision for Internet freedom. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee in March 2010, Posner said, \\"the defense of a free, open and interconnected Internet is in our national and global interests and is important for commerce, for diplomatic and political relations, and for building sustainable democratic societies.\\"Testimony , 2 March 2010 Posner frequently speaks on the topic of Internet freedom and the role of the Internet in advancing human rights and helping people build sustainable democracies.\\"Internet Freedom: Promoting Human Rights in the Digital Age ‚Äì A Panel Discussion\\", United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, March 4, 2011. Under Posner's leadership, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has played a leading role in supporting democratic activists in their use of new technologies, particularly in the Middle East. Posner led efforts described as \\"uncharacteristically cool\\" to fund millions of dollars in technology development meant to aid pro- democracy activists around the world. In describing a \\"panic button\\" designed to allow pro-democracy campaigners wipe out their phones' address books and emit emergency signals to other activists, Posner said, \\"We're operating like venture capitalists. We are looking for the most innovative people who are going to tailor their technology and their expertise to the particular community of people we're trying to protect.\\" Digital activists commended Posner's bureau in this approach in an open letter to Congress in March 2011, saying, \\"The State Department, and particularly the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), has taken significant interest in supporting technologies that enhance Internet freedom, and reached out to leading organizations in a collaborative and open approach\\". =Strategic dialogues= Posner has participated in more than a dozen strategic dialogues since joining the State Department. Both Secretary Clinton and Posner have placed great emphasis on building partnerships beyond the state, and giving civil society a stronger voice in shaping the political decision-making process. In her July 2010 speech in Krak√≥w, Poland, Secretary Clinton said, \\"markets and politics usually receive more attention. But civil society is every bit as important. And it undergirds both democratic governance and broad-based prosperity\\". In February 2010, Posner and Secretary Clinton launched a Strategic Dialogue with Civil Society, an endeavor to help streamline and strengthen dialogue with non-governmental organizations and other members of civil society. Clinton and Posner engaged in a town hall style discussion with over fifty civil society representatives, domestically and internationally. In the summer of 2010, Posner participated in the U.S.-Russia Civil Society Working Group of the Bilateral Commission, which focused on prisons and migration, as well as the Civil Society to Civil Society Summit, where Secretary Clinton told participants \\"we need creative, committed, courageous organizations like you and yours to find innovative solutions, to expose corruption, to give voice to the voiceless, to hold governments accountable to their citizens, to keep people informed and engaged on the issues that matter most to them\\". =Economic and social rights= Posner has been a vocal proponent of the Obama Administration's integrated approach to human rights and the inexorable relationship between national security and economic, social, and political rights. On March 24, Posner delivered a keynote address, \\"The Four Freedoms Turn 70: Ensuring Economic, Political, and National Security in the 21st Century\\", at the American Society of International Law. The speech took place on the anniversary of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous Four Freedom speech. Posner's speech re-examined the Four Freedoms, or \\"moral cornerstones\\", and discussed the important intersection between political and economic rights, which he said are \\"inexorably linked\\". According to Posner, \\"Human dignity has a political component and an economic component\\". Posner highlighted the turmoil in the Middle East as evidence that the shaping of U.S. national security must include the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that only if the two are interlinked will peaceful societies flourish economically, socially, and politically. The unrest in the Middle East, according to Posner, \\"once again demonstrates the fallacy of trying to divide America's \\"hard\\" strategic interests from our \\"soft\\" interests, including our commitment to human rights\\". Posner stated, \\"The recent protests demonstrate the centrality of human rights to those interests and the links among civil, political, economic and social rights\\". =Voluntary Principles= Since March 2010, Posner has been involved in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Established in 2000 (the United States is a founding member), the Voluntary Principles‚Äîan initiative by governments, NGOs, and companies‚Äîprovides guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the safety and security of their operations within a framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Voluntary Principles are the only human rights guidelines designed specifically for oil, gas, and mining companies. On March 22 and 23, 2011, Posner chaired the 11th annual Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Plenary Meeting in Washington, a multi-stakeholder forum where human rights issues in the extractives sector, particularly in areas of conflict and civil strife, were addressed. Posner also participated in the Annual Plenary Meeting in London in March 2010 and in Ottawa in March 2012. Later in May and November 2012, Posner travelled to Libya and Nigeria respectively to conduct multi-stakeholder meetings regarding implementation of the VPs. Currently there are seven governments, 20 companies, 12 NGOs, and four observers participating in the Voluntary Principles.\\"The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights \\", HumanRights.gov, 3 December 2012 =Human Rights Reports= Posner has been actively engaged in reporting on global human rights situations through the State Department's annual Human Rights Reports, which are submitted to Congress by the Department of State in compliance with Sections 116(d) and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended. The report offers a comprehensive record of human rights situations of almost 200 countries and territories worldwide, and uses information from nongovernmental and international organizations, U.S. embassies and consulates, and other sources. At the 2010 Human Rights Report roll-out in April 2011, Posner called it \\"the single most comprehensive report on human rights produced by anybody in the world‚Äî194 countries, 2,200,000 words, 7,000 pages\\".Michael H. Posner, \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2010 \\", U.S. State Department Foreign Press Center, April 8, 2011. That year's report was viewed by more than one million people. Posner highlighted three trends identified in the 2010 report: * Ongoing conflicts that continue to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations * Greater access to connective technologies that has helped to both promote human rights, \\"but also has given governments greater energy in curtailing freedom of expression\\" * The \\"use and misuse of national security legislation and emergency legislation to apply broad curtailments on basic civil liberties\\" The following year, at the rollout of the 2011 Human Rights report, Posner emphasized two worrying trends: * \\"Flawed elections, restrictions on physical and internet freedom, media censorship, attempts to restrict the activities of civil society groups\\" * \\"Increasing persecution of many religious groups, including the Ahmadis, the Bah√° º√≠, Tibetan Buddhists, Jews, and Christians\\" as well as \\"racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, women, and the LGBT community, which continue to face criminalization and violence in many countries\\"\\"Briefing on the Release of the 2011 Human Rights Reports\\", May 24, 2012 The 2011 report was designed to be more concise, focused and user-friendly.John F. Kerry, \\"Secretary's Preface\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, U.S. Department of State =Universal Periodic Review= Posner has been a proponent of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established by the UN General Assembly in 2006 as a process through which the human rights records of the United Nations' 193 Member States is reviewed and assessed. In November 2010, Posner traveled to Geneva as one of three co-heads of the 32-person interagency U.S. government delegation submitting the United States' first report through the UPR to the UN Human Rights Council. Speaking of the UPR at a press conference at the Foreign Press Center in April 2011, Posner stated, \\"We are very open to the notion that people in this country have not only a right but are well open to be critical of what we do, and we engage them in that criticism\\". During the week of the UPR hearing, Posner defended the United States' engagement with the UN Human Rights Council against domestic criticism, saying \\"this is what principled engagement looks like\\".\\"US defends human rights record in first comprehensive review before UN body\\", Associated Press/Star Tribune, 5 November 2010 He reiterated the Obama administration's stance that there was no room for torture or cruel treatment of detainees in U.S. policy: \\"We're not mincing words. We're not winking and nodding\\", he said. \\"The prohibition against torture and cruel treatment applies to every U.S. official, every agency, everywhere in the world. There is an absolute prohibition as a matter of law and policy\\". =International religious freedom= Since being sworn in as Assistant Secretary, Posner has engaged on a number of fronts promoting religious freedom, particularly in the Middle East and South Central Asia. Following the release of the 2009 International Religious Freedom Report, Posner discussed religious freedom issues in the Middle East before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. Said Posner, \\"Religion is a global phenomenon and all nations, including the United States, wrestle with how best to accommodate their religious diversity. We are convinced that the freedom to profess, practice, and promote one's religion is a basic human right, a social good, a source of stability, and a key component of international security\\".Michael H. Posner, \\"The State of Political and Religious Freedom in the Middle East\\", Statement before House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, November 19, 2009. Posner has engaged on international religious freedom issues in meetings with Egyptian Coptic Christians, Chinese religious freedom advocates, Vietnamese, Pakistani, and Afghan officials, and others since being sworn in as Assistant Secretary.

They were one of the busiest vocal groups in England during the late 1950s and early 1960s, singing back-up behind Joe Brown, Billy Fury, Eden Kane, and Benny Hill, amongst others, and made dozens of television appearances between 1958 and 1964. Career The quartet's origins were in the mid-1950s, when they were in their early teens at school together. Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway, and Roger Maggs' earliest influences were skiffle and rock and roll, and they began getting booked to play local dances. The trio expanded to a quartet with the addition to Geoff Williams, who extended their harmonies upward into the falsetto range. They quickly started to focus on singing and became established as a harmony vocal group. Their main influences were American rhythm and blues harmony groups such as The Platters and The Penguins, whom they did their best to emulate vocally. The group members went through the Army at the same time, continuing to work together whenever possible, and it was during this period that they got their name. They initially started working together as the Beltones and the Hi-Fi's, but their manager, taking his lead from the manufacturer of the pencil he had in his hand at the time, decreed that they should become The Kestrels. It also fit in with an American tradition of harmony vocal groups that were named after birds (the Crows, the Penguins etc.). The Kestrels' debut single for Pye Records, \\"In The Chapel In The Moonlight,\\" originally released as the B-side of their cover of Jack Scott's \\"There Comes A Time,\\" came close to charting in late 1959. The group bounced briefly over to Decca before returning to Pye Records, and a long-term contract to record for that label's Piccadilly imprint. Their subsequent releases failed to chart, but they remained busy on their own performances and also backing Pye's resident star, Lonnie Donegan, on some of his records (including the 1962 gospel album Sing Hallelujah) and his live performances. The Kestrels finished their military service early in 1960, and were able to resume their music work full-time. They carried on, trying several different approaches to choosing their songs, but mostly covering American hits. In 1964, Pete Gullane left and was replaced by Roger Cook. In 1998, Sequel Records brought out a double album pairing thirty songs by The Kestrels, with thirty songs from fellow Bristolian group The Eagles. They had a reunion in 1997, and over the subsequent years have raised substantial funds for charity. In 2009 they released a charity CD (produced by Greenaway) entitled The Kestrels, Still Flying After 50 Years. Geoff Williams, one of the original quartet, suffered a heart attack and died on 20 August 2010 aged 71, whilst on holiday in Crete.

History Nansen Academy was founded as a humanist and anti-totalitarian institution. The school was named after polar explorer, scientist, author and humanist Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930). His work embodied essential elements of humanism: active love of one's neighbour and freedom of thought. The school was established in 1938 by Kristian Vilhelm Koren Schjelderup, Jr. (1894‚Äì1980) Bishop of the Diocese of Hamar together with future Norwegian Resistance Movement members Anders Platou Wyller (1903-1940) and Henriette Bie Lorentzen (1911‚Äì2001). Its first school year started in 1939. It was closed and dissolved during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, after only one year of existence. It resurfaced after the liberation of Norway at the end of World War II and re-opened in 1946.P√•l Repstad, Teologisk profilering i sosial kontekst. Kristian Schjelderups liv, tid og teologi, Kristiansand 1994, pp. 436‚Äì437 The Nansen Academy offers a one-year study founded in the Folk high school tradition common to Scandinavian nations. The interdisciplinary programme is mainly based on social and humanistic sciences. Historical, holistic and ethical perspectives are encouraged. The main aim is to inspire independent thinking and reflection, as well as creativity, as a basis for active participation in society. All students attend classes in philosophy, international security politics and cultural history (art, literature, music) as well as their chosen programme. The students stay in dormitories on campus. The Nansen Academy initiated the Norwegian Festival of Literature (Norsk Litteraturfestival) and the first national dialogues between religions in Norway. It organizes the yearly Olympic academies in cooperation with the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of sports. The Nansen Academy also organises a center working on dialogue in war zones and for peace education, Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue. The academy received the Fritt Ord Award (Fritt Ords pris) in 1987 and received Honourable Mention for the ‚ÄúUNESCO Prize for Peace Education‚Äù in 1998.

Stations The nine √ñ2 radio stations, each of which serves one state of the Austrian Federal Republic (plus the Italian province of South Tyrol) are: *Radio Burgenland, Burgenland *Radio K√§rnten, Carinthia *Radio Nieder√∂sterreich, Lower Austria *Radio Ober√∂sterreich, Upper Austria *Radio Salzburg, Salzburg *Radio Steiermark, Styria *Radio Tirol, Tyrol (also broadcast in the Italian province of South Tyrol) *Radio Vorarlberg, Vorarlberg *Radio Wien, Vienna These stations' output is broadcast on FM analogue and (for now, Radio Wien only) digital radio, as well as being available via cable, the internet, and satellite (Astra 19.2¬∞E). Operation The nine stations all broadcast a large amount of regional content as well as offering news, weather, traffic, regional reports, and music, all produced in each station's own radio centres (one for each federal state). Over the last few years, the regional stations ‚Äì their core target audience being listeners in the 50+ age group ‚Äì have evolved into Oldies stations in terms of their musical format and this has made them clear market leaders in terms of market share and reach. They chiefly play oldies, Schlager music, and classic hits as well as other musical genres of a less demanding nature. Some of the stations, however, such as Radio Ober√∂sterreich, do also broadcast a certain number of classical music programmes as well as cultural and feature items similar to those aired on the nationwide √ñ1 channel. Historically, one of the longest-running √ñ2 programmes was the daily Autofahrer unterwegs (\\"motorists under way\\"), 15,153 editions of which were broadcast between 1957 and 1999. The popularity of this programme meant that it was broadcast nationwide by all the regional stations. Up until the 1990s, many √ñ2 programmes were dominated by popular folk music (Volkst√ºmliche Musik), leading to the network often being derogatorily referred to as \\"housewives' radio\\". In the period preceding the time when private, commercial radio stations were finally allowed to broadcast in Austria (at first, regionally only), a number of the √ñ2 stations began giving their playlists a more international flavour. The new regional private radio stations, for their part, tried to gain market share by focusing on a contemporary hit radio format, competing more with ORF's nationwide Hitradio √ñ3 than with the √ñ2 stations. The publicly funded √ñ2 radio stations, with their considerably greater financial and staff resources, were better able to hold on to their market share, not only in the radio sector, but also in news journalism as a whole. With the exception of world news coverage, all regional radio stations produce their own content 24 hours a day, with a lot of regional content. Regional news (generally broadcast every half-hour), detailed journals (Landesrundschau etc.), reports and service elements ensure high listener loyalty. Music programming is chosen through based on many criteria and is mostly made up of oldies, classic hits and even traditional Volksmusik. The balance between different genres varies between the stations; some concentrate on oldies, while others mainly play German schlager and folksy music. During the night, each radio station broadcasts its own non-stop music program, which is only interrupted for the news. Up until the mid-1990s, all √ñ2 radio stations had the same framing programme, which only got interrupted for a few hours for regional content. This collective radio was first called √ñsterreich Regional but was changed during its later years to √ñsterreich 2. To expand its programme, the regional studios contributed their own programs, such as Autofahrer unterwegs, Turnier auf der Schallaburg (\\"Tournament at the Schallaburg\\") and other formats. After the introduction of computers to radio broadcasting in the late 1990s, production costs were significantly reduced, which allowed the ORF to fully regionalize its radio. The name √ñsterreich 2 was eliminated completely, as all regional radio stations now carry the name of their state.

The Chicago Bears of the NFL, which had drafted him during the war, still had a strong interest in him, as did the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who selected Gambino in the twenty second round of the 1948 AAFC Draft.

Definition  A randomized algorithm makes a set of random choices. These random choices may be intricately related making it difficult to analyze it. In many of these cases Principle of Deferred Decisions is used. The idea behind the principle is that the entire set of random choices are not made in advance, but rather fixed only as they are revealed to the algorithm.  Applications  The clock solitaire game = The principle is used to evaluate and determine the probability of \\"win\\" from a deck of cards. The idea is to let the random choices unfold, until the iteration ends at 52, where if the fourth card is drawn out of a group labeled \\"K\\", the game terminates.  References Sources * M.

The palace of 50 rooms was built at enormous expense by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli for Count Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, Empress Elizabeth's chancellor and maternal relative by marriage. The palace took eight years to build, starting in 1749. After his niece Elizaveta Vorontsova fell from grace, Vorontsov was effectively exiled from the court and sold his main residence to the crown. Paul I of Russia gave the palace to the Knights Hospitaller, of which he was Grand Master. Another Italian architect working in Russia, Giacomo Quarenghi, was then asked to modernise the palace. In 1798‚Äì1800, Quarenghi added a Catholic chapel to serve exiled French aristocrats who resided in the Russian capital at the turn of the 19th century (see Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller for details). Since 1810, the Vorontsov Palace has housed a succession of exclusive military schools, including the famous Page Corps (1810‚Äì1918) and the Suvorov Military School (1955‚Äìpresent). The palace is screened from Sadovaya Street by an elaborate cast iron grille, and it is separated from the Fontanka Embankment by a large garden.

According to data provided by the XII General Census of 2000 documenting Population and Housing carried out by the National Institute of Geographic Statistics and Informatics (INEGI), there are three main ethnic groups in the municipality: whites, indigenous Mexicans and blacks, which by intermarriage have formed the current phenotypical characteristics of some of the Cuajinicuilapa population. It is possible to distinguish some small numbers of Indians in the town of Cuajinicuilapa. According to INEGI there are around 1,170 indigenous people in this town, representing 4.56% on the total municipal population whose languages are amusgo with 297 speakers, Mixtec with 211 speakers, Nahuatl with 5, Tlapanecos with 22, Zapotec with 2. There are also whites and other native Indian newcomers to the municipality who are traders and merchants. Some residents of the municipality have distinct Negroid features which in colonial days were called \\"mulatos pardos\\" (mulatto brown) denoting their negroid admixture.http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=cuajinicuilapa#01 The municipality View of Punta Maldonado As seat, the town of Cuajinicuilapa is the local government for ninety communities, which together cover an area of 715km2. The municipality borders the municipalities of Azoy√∫, Ometepec, Juchit√°n and Marquelia with the Pacific Ocean to the south and west and the state of Oaxaca to the east. It has 28 preschools, 41 primary schools, 14 middle schools and three public high schools. There is also a vocational school and a high school run by the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guerrero. The main roads of the municipality are Highway 200 connecting Acapulco and Pinotepa Nacional and the local road connecting Cuajinicuilapa with Punta Maldonado. The rest of the communities are connected by dirt roads. One notable Afro-Mexican community outside the seat is San Nicol√°s. The residents here have a reputation for festivities and dancing. It is said that people have gotten ill and even died after parties called fandangos, which can last for up to three days. The Playa de Tierra Colorada is located in the community of the same name located between Punta Maldonado and the Barra de Tecoanapa. The area was declared an ecological reserve by the municipality in 1986 because it is a breeding area for marine turtles as well as its rich vegetation. Punta Maldonado is a small cape, which is the furthest point east of the state of Guerrero. It is an important fishing port, especially of rock lobster as well as its large Afro- Mexican population. The men go out to sea at night to fish in shifts that can last up to fifteen hours every day. It has a small antique lighthouse very near the border with Oaxaca. The Santo Domingo lagoon has a wide variety of fish and birds especially among its mangroves. Near Santo Domingo is the Barra del P√≠o. It is generally inhabited only during certain fishing seasons, with houses here that are abandoned during other times of the year.  History  Cuajinicuilapa is located on what was once the Ayacastla province, stretching from the river Ayutla all the way to the plains that share borders with the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, and was integrated with people of different ethnic and language groups such as: Ayutla Xochitonala, Acatlan Cuauhtepec, Tututepec, and the Tlacuilo had the language of the Mixtec. Nahuatl was probably the majority. Igualapa and Ometepec spoke ayacasteca, but also understood amusga speaking individuals. This language was peculiar to Xicay√°n, Ayotzinapa and Xochistlahuaca. They also formed part of the province of Huehuet√°n which spoke Huehueteca. The Quetzapotla, spoke quetzapoteca and Quahuitl√°n spoke quahuteca. Cuajinicuilapa lies precisely in what was Quahhuitl√°n, which is an area thirty miles wide and fifty miles long which was situated on the dividing line between the town now called Cuajinicuilapa and the State of Oaxaca. Quahuitl√°n was subject to the chieftainship of Tututepec. In 1824, when Mexico first became a Federal Republic, Cuajinicuilapa belonged to the party of Ayutla and to the District of Tlapa in the State of Puebla. By creating the state of Guerrero in 1850 Cuajiniculapa was integrated to the municipality of Ometepec and the District of Allende in 1852 and was constituted as a town with the southern part of Ometepec and was integrated to San Nicol√°s Maldonado which is the municipal head of Cuajinicuilapa which since 1862 belongs to Abasolo district.

Later, the Olmecs to the territory, and tribes settled on the Mezcala River, and numerous objects of Olmec style have been excavated from this region. Tribes settled in Tepecoacuilco in the first millennium of the current era, including one called Chontales which inhabited the Tepecoacuilco area. This tribe had its main seat in Ixcateopan, and formed a powerful dynasty in this area. The Chontales faithfully preserved their cultural characteristics, and achieved important progress in political and social organization. This government was in element patriarchal, each village was governed by a Lord or the Patriarch and priests in temples. Their main gods were the rain god Tlamacasqui and the goddess Acxoyatl. They lived in huts built of adobe with palm roofs. Men wore cloaks tied at the shoulder and loincloths, the women long petticoats. Their diet consisted of tortillas, corn, and vegetables. In the 11th century, invaders penetrated the territory, Nahua tribes, which came from the north-west. Some of them settled by the Balsas River, to conquer the region and the Chontales. In this tribe was known as the Nahua-coixca, which means \\"Plain of snake.\\" The Coixcas arrived and were completely primitive, surviving by hunting, farming and living in caves. Their warrior god was Huitzilopochtli.

Additionally, information from the ŒºTP congestion controller can be used to choose the transfer rate of TCP connections. LEDBAT is described in RFC 6817. As of 2009, the details of the ŒºTP implementation were different from those of the then-current Internet Draft.

It had no powers of subpoena, nor official imprimatur from any government. It was composed of historians, sociologists, journalists, authors, and other notable figures, including Edmund Wilson, Suzanne La Follette, Louis Hacker, Norman Thomas, John Dos Passos, Reinhold Niebuhr, George Novack, Franz Boas, John Chamberlain and Sidney Hook. John Dewey, then seventy-eight years old, agreed to head its Commission of Inquiry.Beard, Becker and the Trotsky Inquiry, by Harold Kirker and Burleigh Taylor Wilkins ¬© 1961 The Johns Hopkins University Press. American Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Winter, 1961), pp. 516-525 History In March 1937, The American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky initiated the so-called Dewey Commission (officially the \\"Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials\\"). The inquiry was named after its Chairman, John Dewey. Its other members were Carleton Beals, an authority on Latin-American affairs; Otto Ruehle, biographer of Karl Marx and former member of the Reichstag; American journalists Benjamin Stolberg and Suzanne LaFollette (Secretary); Alfred Rosmer, who in 1920-21 had been a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International; Wendelin Thomas, leader of the Wilhelmshaven sailors‚Äô revolt in November 1918 and later a Communist member of the German Reichstag; Edward A. Ross, Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin; former literary critic of The New York Times John Chamberlain, Carlo Tresca, Italian-American anarchist leader; and Mexican journalist Francisco Zamora. A sub-commission, comprising the first five commission members listed above, conducted thirteen hearings at Trotsky's home in Coyoacan, Mexico, D.F., from April 10 to April 17, 1937. Leon Trotsky was defended by the lawyer Albert Goldman. John Finerty acted as the commission's legal counsel. During the course of the \\"trial\\", committee member Mauritz A. Hallgren, formerly an editor of The Nation magazine, made headlines with a public resignation from the committee published in the pages of the New York Times.Arthur Jay Klinghoffer andJudith Apter Klinghoffer, International Citizens' Tribunals: Mobilizing Public Opinion to Advance Human Rights. New York: Palgrave, 2002; pg. 71. Hallgren charged that the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky had \\"become an instrument of the Trotskyists for political intervention against the Soviet Union.\\"Quoted in \\"An Open Letter to American Liberals,\\" Soviet Russia Today, March 1937, pp. 14-15. Hallgren's January 27, 1937, letter of resignation was later published as a 1-cent pamphlet by the Communist Party's International Publishers.Mauritz A. Hallgren, Why I Resigned from the Trotsky Defense Committee. New York: International Publishers, 1937. Albert Einstein, although noting that Trotsky deserved the opportunity to prove his innocence, was critical of the Dewey inquiry: \\"The question is raised because Trotsky is an extremely active and adroit politician, who might well search for an effective platform for the presentation and promulgation of his political goals in the public sphere. . . . I'm afraid that the only result would be Trotsky's own self-promotion without the possibility of a well-grounded judgment.\\"Quoted in Christopher Phelps. Young Sidney Hook: Marxist and Pragmatist. Michigan: University of Michigan Press. 2005. p. 153. Conclusions of the inquiry Following months of investigation, the Dewey Commission made its findings public in New York on September 21, 1937.Dewey Commission Report The commission purported to clear Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials and, moreover, exposed the scale of the alleged frame-up of all other defendants during these trials. Among its conclusions, it stated that \\"the conduct of the Moscow trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no effort was made to ascertain the truth.

This group had 2 studios, one in Tyrol and one in Vorarlberg. In 1952 the transmitters were handed over to the state government of Tyrol. The program was mixed, from news and information shows to classical music, radio dramas and other features. In the literature department of Radio Tirol, talents like Axel Corti, Otto Gr√ºnmandl or Bert Breit were found. During 1954 and 1956 the Sendergruppe West was integrated into the ORF.

ORF Tirol did not only produce Radio Tirol, but also TV shows for √ñsterreich Bild, from 1988 also the regional news \\"Tirol heute\\". In 1992 the old marketing name √ñR, which stood for √ñsterreich Regional, was discontinued and √ñ2 was used from then on.

From time to time Radio Tirol also produces special programs in connection with ski-ing events.

Born in Caracas, Nebrada began his career as a dancer with the National Ballet of Venezuela, Alicia Alonso's National Ballet of Cuba, with Roland Petit in Paris, and with the Joffrey Ballet (1959). Nebrada was a founding member of the Harkness Ballet, where he created his first ballet Percussion for Six Men, in 1969. In 1975 Nebrada helped found the International Ballet of Caracas and became their artistic director and resident choreographer in 1977. In 1984 he became the artistic director of the National Ballet of Caracas where he remained until his death due to leukemia in 2002. His dances have been performed by Ballet Hispanico, American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, National Ballet of Canada, Berlin Opera Ballet, English National Ballet, Australian Ballet and the Universal Ballet of Korea. A distinctive style His style is undeniably Neoclassical. His duets or pas de deux are known for their plasticity, expressiveness and intricate lifts. His partnering style shows a great deal of upper-body freedom while the ballerina moves on and off-balance. His spatial designs are symmetrical, harmonious and often organic, with dancers moving across the stage, while lending a visceral sense of ownership to his dances. Many of his narrative ballets are filled with colors and dramatic effervescence. This approach is inherent to Latin American idiosyncrasy, and his existence is perhaps a residue from the classic ballets of the romantic era. Some of his best known narrative ballets or classical adaptations are The Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet, FireBird, Don Quijote, Copelia, Cinderella, In√©s de Castro, Van Gogh, and George Sand.Belen, Lobo. Nebreda-Nebrada. Consejo Nacional De la Cultura. Fundacion Chacao. Editorial Arte. Caracas 06.1996 He also imprinted his signature style to many abstract or non-narrative ballets. Some of them present some scenes based on stories or imagery, but they are still considered non-narrative as they do not follow a plot or a script. Examples include Our Waltzes, Lento a Tempo e Apassionato, La luna y Los h√≠jos que ten√≠a, Una Danza para ti, A Haendel's Celebration, Pentimento, Double Colchea and Fever, among others. Allan Ulricht, writer of the Dance examiner for the San Francisco Chronicle, said: \\"‚Ä¶'Fever' is clearly an export ballet‚Ä¶\\" \\"‚Ä¶The choreography is structured like a classical diversion and Nebrada affirms the women's communal purpose with repeated circular forays. Some of the women struggle, others yield and one is raised aloft like the spirit of feminism triumphant. Thanks to the eight fearless dancers, the effect was intensely visceral. As La Lupe kept singing, 'Adios, adios, adios', I wanted to shout, 'Bienvenido, bienvenido, bienvenido‚Ä¶' (1995)[3 Allan, Ulrich. Examiner-Dance Critic, International Dance Troupes a Joy to See. San Francisco Examiner. 11 May. 1995. Web. www.sfgate.com] Legacy Nebrada's extensive body of work brought a sense of distinctiveness and relevance to Venezuela's cultural heritage. His choreographies continue to be performed around the world as they emerged during a particularly prosper era of Neoclassical ballet in the 20th century. He sought after dancers with both expressivity and technical abilities, and most of his male dancers also needed to be skilled partners. His choreographic style gave an identity to the National Ballet of Caracas, which became the resident ballet company of the Teresa Carre√±o Cultural complex in 1984. Despite frequent interruptions due to government cuts, the company's funding is subsidized mostly by the Venezuelan government. As with many other companies in the world, the National Ballet of Caracas continue to struggle to maintain its season, pay its dancers and remain viable. Awards Nebrada has been the recipient of numerous awards. Among them: *1976: Fokine Award, for the choreography Shadows awarded by the Dance University in Paris *1984: CONAC Award of Classic Dance, awarded by the National Cultural Council.

Ilangaratne, the Sri Lankan Minister for Foreign Affairs was the first prestigious person who visited Hungary from Sri Lanka, in 1964. Since then the two countries have exchanged occasional high-level visits. In 1975 the two countries signed an Agreement on Technological and Scientific Cooperation, and in 1979 they signed a Cultural Cooperation Agreement. In June 2004, the Sri Lankan Finance Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that trade exchanges and the bilateral agreements between Sri Lanka and Hungary were beneficial to both countries, and vowed to establish a sustainable link with Hungary. In November 2006, officials of the Ministry of Finance visited Hungary. The meeting resulted in finalizing of a Framework Agreement for Financial Cooperation with Hungary, worth Euro51 million. The agreement was signed in February 2007. In August 2008 Dr. G√©za P√°lmai, Ambassador for Hungary, visited Sri Lanka and met with the President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama. They discussed enhanced bilateral relations, investment by Hungarian companies in Sri Lanka, improvements in trade and tourism and Hungarian investment in infrastructure development projects in Sri Lanka. Between 20‚Äì22 April 2009 a delegation of Sri Lankan business people met with their counterparts in Budapest to discuss trade opportunities. Addressing the meeting, Export Development and International Trade Minister G.L.

In reply, Gyorgy Kapati of the Chamber of Commerce of Hungary said that the Hungarian business sector considers the developing situation in Sri Lanka particularly conducive to investment Development aid Hungary contributed to relief after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and has since stepped up aid to Sri Lanka. Hungary has contributed to relief and reconstruction efforts after the tsunami in Sri Lanka and other countries. This included a contribution of wheat flour valued at US$55,000. Hungary also sent doctors and medicine to assist the survivors. Private donations contributed to construction of a 100-housing unit village. In 2009, the Hungarian government planned to invest 2,850 million rupees (about USD24 million) for construction and supply of sophisticated machinery for a sea sand plant in Kalutara, Sri Lanka.

Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 390‚Äì391. Geography The settlement lies next Lake Zbilje (), a reservoir created in 1954 by building the Medvode hydroelectric power plant. The lake is a popular tourist site. Fields lie to the north and west of the settlement. Name Zbilje was attested in written sources in 1311 as Villach (and as Sbyliach in 1341, Willagk in 1379, Zwilach in 1410, Zwillach in 1444, and Swillach in 1499). The origin of the name is uncertain. The medieval transcriptions of the name without initial S- or Z- indicate that it may have been created from the prepositional phrase *z Biljan (with a genitive form of the demonym *Biljane, later yielding -Bilje). A second possibility is that the name is derived from the personal name *S—äbyl—ä, preserved today in the Slovene surname Sbil. A less likely possibility is that it was created from the personal name *Byl—ä with the prefix *s—ä.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, pp. 478‚Äì479. In the past the German name was Swile. History The settlement originally stood 1 km north of its present site, on the right side of the road to Podreƒça. At some point, the old settlement burned down, and the villagers moved to the current location, where they built their houses. When the fields are plowed at the old site, this occasionally turns up pieces of the old road that used to run through the village. Church The local church in the settlement is dedicated to John the Baptist, built in 1883 on the site of an earlier church that was consecrated in 1496. The main altar dates to 1665. The painting of Saint Andrew on the right side of the altar is a work by Marko Layer, and the painting of Saint Valentine on the left side of the altar was painted by Matej Trpin in 1915. The church was formerly a pilgrimage church and was known as Saint John the Baptist in Le≈°ovje ().

In 1255, Alfonso gave her lands in La Alcarria which included Cifuentes, Viana de Mond√©jar, Palazuelos, Salmer√≥n, Vadesliras and Alcocer. With the collaboration of King Alfonso, she founded the Monastery of Santa Clara de Alcocer in an unpopulated village called San Miguel del Monte within the jurisdiction of Alcocer.

On December 31, 1244, Alfonso with the consent of his father, donated the village of Elche to his daughter Beatrice, most probably born around that date, which would seem to indicate that the relationship was stable and accepted.  Death and burial  She died in early 1262 and was buried in the monastery of the Poor Clares that she had founded at San Miguel del Monte. Years later, on July 24, 1276, King Alfonso executed an agreement with Juan Gonz√°lez who made a walnut-wood sepulchre with a bas-relief image of Mayor. The parchment document was auctioned at Christie's in 2009.Auctioned parchment at Christie's The convent, as well as her sepulcher were moved to Alcocer years later.

Both nations enjoy friendly relations, the importance of which centres on the history of Hungarian immigration to Brazil. Approximately 100,000 Brazilians have Hungarian ancestry, making it the largest Hungarian community in Latin America.Hist√≥ria breve das rela√ß√µes bilaterais (in Portuguese) Both nations are members of the United Nations. History The first wave of Hungarian immigration to Brazil took place in the second half of the nineteenth century, due to the promise from Brazil to provide pieces of land for immigrants (as a way to encourage European immigration to the country) with many settling in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. In 1871, during a tour of Europe, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil visited Hungary (at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).Brasil-Hungria (in Portuguese) In 1873, Brazil opened an honorary consulate in Budapest. In 1917 during World War I, Brazil declared war on the Central Powers (which included Hungary). The second big wave of Hungarian immigrants arrived to Brazil just after World War I, mainly from the territories Hungary lost as a consequence of the Treaty of Trianon. In 1923, Brazil recognized the independence of Hungary and in 1927, both nations established diplomatic relations. That same year, Hungary opened a diplomatic legation in Rio de Janeiro and Brazil opened one too in Budapest in 1929. In 1942, Brazil declared war on the Axis powers (for which Hungary belonged to). As a result, diplomatic relations between Brazil and Hungary were severed. During the war (and soon afterwards), many Hungarians immigrated to Brazil, particularly Hungarians of Jewish origin. Relations between both nations were re-established in 1961 and in 1962, Brazil re-opened its diplomatic legation in Budapest. In 1974, both nations elevated their legations to embassies. In 1994, Brazilian President-Elect, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, paid a visit to Hungary. In 1997, Hungarian President √Årp√°d G√∂ncz paid a visit to Brazil, becoming the first Hungarian head-of-state to visit the South American nation. In 2011, the Hungarian Government launched a strategic planning document that included Brazil among its foreign policy priorities. In 2013, Brazilian Vice- President Michel Temer paid a visit to Hungary. In 2017, both nations celebrated 90 years of diplomatic relations. In January 2019, Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb√°n, paid a visit to Brazil to attend the inauguration for President Jair Bolsonaro.

There are phases of varying lengths, from 6 days to a month, that have specific focuses. During these phases, students gain skills and training in various life skills, personal development, social development, service training, urban/city life familiarization, leadership, and career development. The mission of VTE is to provide youth with the skills and knowledge necessary to make a successful transition from school to life, which they accomplish through over 70 partnerships with schools and businesses. History The Chugach School District underwent major changes starting in 1994. They went from the bottom quartile in Alaska to, just five years after rebuilding their education system, the top quartile. This began with two years of input-gathering from communities and businesses. Performance-Based Education Chugach is recognized as being one of the longest-running, public performance-based school districts. This model is described as a \\"reversal\\" of the traditional education equation. Instead of time being the constant and learning being the variable, as in the traditional system, learning is the constant and time is the variable. Awards In 2001, the Chugach School District became the first educational institution to earn the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award offered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In 2008, Chugach School District won the Alaska Performance Excellence (APEX) award of quality. External links *Chugach School District official page. On Facebook *FOCUS Homeschool official page.

He acquired the nickname 'Midget' from his family, in reference to his short height. He stands at 5'2\\". Early life Robert \\"Midget\\" Molley was born on March 4, 1959 in Atlantic City, New Jersey to Benjamin Franklin Molley, a Pentecostal pastor, and Helen Louise Molley. He was the ninth of twelve children. The family was religious and strict and Robert would often have to listen to family sermons late into the night. Midget Molley's father died of a brain tumor in 1969, obliging his mother to seek work in local hotels, away from the home where six of the Molley children still lived. Around the age of six, family members noticed that Robert was not growing at the normal rate as kids his age, thus they began joking by referring to him as a midget. The title stuck and Robert became known as Midget Molley. He reached an adult height of . In 1976, Midget Molley became a member of the Nation of Islam, under the national leadership of Elijah Muhammad. He belonged to Temple #10, located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the Nation of Islam he was known as Brother Robert 8X. He subsequently changed his name to Hakeem Ali Abdul- Shaheed to reflect the path the Nation of Islam had taken after the death of Elijah Muhammad. 1980s In 1980, Molley was convicted for attempted murder and was sentenced to serve ten years at Bayside State Prison. He was released after serving six years. Abdul-Shaheed was released and had returned to drug dealing by September 1986. He began trading cocaine supplied by Angel Diaz- Rivera and his wife Gloria, members of Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel of cocaine distributors. Abdul-Shaheed ran a three-member cocaine dealing operation with Victor \\"Shorty\\" Fernandez, a Dominican man, and Lucy \\"Luz\\" Bertone, a Puerto Rican woman. Each of the three received 600 kilos of cocaine per shipment. Bertone and Fernandez dealt in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, New York, while Abdul-Shaheed distributed his drugs in New Jersey, Syracuse, New York, Washington, DC, Maryland and Atlanta, Georgia. Hakeem Abdul Shaheed (aka Robert E. Molley or Midget Molley), and most of its 60 some members were believed to be Five Percenters. Shaheed, a resident of Atlantic City and Vineland, called his group the ASO Posse and often flaunted his drug- financed wealth by wearing a gold crown valued at around $1.5 million.Afro- lineal organized crime On January 1, 1989, Abdul-Shaheed walked into Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino Ballroom wearing his gold crown and surrounded by \\"his most trusted distributors.\\" Law enforcement personnel were angered by this display of ill-gotten wealth. =1989 conviction= In February 1989 Abdul- Shaheed and 20 of his distributors were arrested after a seven-month investigation by the United States Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Abdul-Shaheed was suspected of two murders in Atlantic City, one in Syracuse, New York, two in Washington, DC, one in Maryland, and three in Atlanta, Georgia. He was convicted of none. In 1990 Abdul-Shaheed was convicted of being a drug king pin and sentenced to over 19 years in Federal prison under the 848 statute. The crown he had worn was never found, though federal agents have photographs of Abdul-Shaheed wearing it. Shortly after Shaheed‚Äôs arrest, several Jamaican drug dealers from Brooklyn Jamaican Posse moved into the Atlantic City projects to take over his territory. 2000s In 2006 Midget Molley was released from prison, and he now lives in Atlantic City. Abdul-Shaheed speaks with young people about \\"staying free of crime\\" and also acts as \\"an advocate for incarcerated Muslims\\". Abdul-Shaheed founded the nonprofit organization named \\"The D=Bear Youth Foundation\\", which addresses problems with gangs & gang violence, drug use & sales, and teen sex. Books In 2007 Ali Rob wrote a novel based on Abdul-Shaheed's life and times, The Myth of Midget Molley. A later book also written by Rob, titled Resurrection of A Legend, also explores Midget Molley's life. ReferencesFurther reading * American Gangster. Season 3, Episode 3.

It lets users apply dynamic, user-generated tagging that helps other users easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing a hash symbol in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores. Searching for that hashtag yields each message that someone has tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag. For example, on the photo-sharing service Instagram, the hashtag #bluesky allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag. The use of hashtags was first proposed by Chris Messina in a 2007 tweet, that, although initially decried by Twitter as a \\"thing for nerds,\\" eventually led to their use rapidly becoming widespread throughout the platform. Messina, who made no attempt to patent the use because he felt \\"they were born of the internet, and owned by no one\\", has subsequently been credited as the godfather of the hashtag. By the end of the decade hashtags could be seen in most emerging as well as established social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube ‚Äî so much so that Instagram had to officially place a \\"30 hashtags\\" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use, a limit that Instagrammers eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts. As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags and their use is common by millennials, Gen Z, politicians, influencers, and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, hashtag was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2014. The term hashtag is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag. Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered machine- readable by the markup that hashtags provide. This process is called folksonomy.  Origin and uses  The number sign or hash symbol \\"#\\" is often used in information technology to highlight a special meaning. (The symbol is also called an \\"octothorpe\\" or \\"pound sign\\" in the US, and \\"hash\\" in the UK) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote immediate address mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language to indicate special keywords that the C preprocessor had to process first. In the 1986 SGML standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) that precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the pound sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the pound sign: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North- American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most pound signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination. The pound sign was adopted for use within IRC (Internet Relay Chat) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.\\"Channel Scope\\". Section 2.2. Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an ampersand '&'). The use of the pound sign in IRC inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network. He posted the first hashtag on Twitter: A sign with a #TimeToAct hashtag at a 2014 conference Messina's suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the 2007 San Diego forest fires in Southern California.What is hashtag?\\", Mashable, 8 October 2013 According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for \\"lay\\" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag \\"was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages.\\" Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details. Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the 2009‚Äì2010 Iranian election protests; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and Persian-language hashtags in communications during the events. The first published use of the term \\"hash tag\\" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, \\"Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,\\" on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer Ben Zimmer, chair of the American Dialect Society's New Words Committee. Beginning July 2, 2009, Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced \\"Trending Topics\\" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to spam the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally. Although the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+. = Other uses = The feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on YouTube and Gawker Media. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website. Real-time search aggregators such as the former Google Real-Time Search also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the \\"river\\" of Twitter posts.  Broadcast media  The use of hashtags has extended to televisiona concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen bug, encouraging viewers to participate in a backchannel of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. Television commercials have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes. Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement. While personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \\"branded\\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., #edshow as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \\"trend\\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for a live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags that identify a series being broadcast (e.g., #SunnyFX) and instantaneous, \\"temporary\\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts. Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the Nielsen television ratings system. An example of trending \\"temporary\\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, a variety talk show on NBC. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \\"Tonight Show Hashtags,\\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \\"Tonight Show Hashtags\\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show. The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \\"keywords\\" by AOL in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes. The late-night television comedy game show @midnight with Chris Hardwick on Comedy Central features a daily game entitled \\"Hashtag Wars,\\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme. Some hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \\"Je suis Charlie,\\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with Charlie Hebdo offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.  Purchasing  Since February 2013 Twitter and American Express have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.  Event promotion  Stencil graffiti promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights Organized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events. Companies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns. Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as #OccupyWallStreet and #LibyaFeb17, have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially titled the 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit as the \\"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\\".  Consumer complaints  Hashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \\"bashtag\\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, McDonald's created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.  Sentiment analysis  The use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is sarcastic‚Äîa difficult AI problem.  Sports  The YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, Hashtag United F.C.. The hashtag is also used in reference to the name of performance action- sports brand, Hashtag Board Co. Since the 2012‚Äì13 season, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.  Style  A hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space or end of message. It is always safe to precede the \\"#\\" with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores. In many cases, other characters are also allowed, in particular, accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet; is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet.; Hashtags are not case sensitive: a search for \\"#hashtag\\" finds \\"#HashTag\\". The use of embedded capitals (CamelCase) increases legibility and avoids confusion. A (real) pen shop should use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case. On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g., \\"It is #sunny today\\"). Languages that do not use word dividers handle hashtags differently. In China, microblogs Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo use a double-hashtag- delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between Chinese characters necessitates a closing tag. Twitter uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and orthographies with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., 'Êàë #Áà± ‰Ω†' instead of 'Êàë#Áà±‰Ω†') or by zero-width non-joiner characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced 'Êàë‚Äå#Áà±‚Äå‰Ω†', but with invisible non- joiners delimiting the hashtag). It is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the \\"absolute maximum\\", and any contribution exceeding this risks \\"raising the ire of the community.\\" As well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation can filter an account from search results, or suspend the account. Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in September 2013.  Function  Search bar in the header of a social networking site, searching for most recent posts containing the hashtag #science Hashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can \\"trend\\" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it appears in the \\"Trending Topics\\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \\"retired\\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them. Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \\"trending topics\\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic. Hashtags also function as beacons that help users find and \\"follow\\" (subscribe) or \\"list\\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest. Television broadcasters such as Channel 4 have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as First Dates and The Undateables. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme. Hashtags can be used on the social network Instagram, by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use. The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular subaltern communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.Olszanowski, M. (2014). \\"Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship\\". Visual Communication Quarterly, 21(1), 83‚Äì95. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F Famous YouTube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic. Hashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta- commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech. In addition, the culture of hashtag has developed due to recent Black Lives Matter movement. In this case hashtags has been used to access vital information and news update on the topic. https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277852/blackout-tuesday-posts-hiding- information-blm-black-lives-matter-hashtag Similarly, hashtags were used for the #MeToo social movement. It was used to spread awareness and empower people to fight for gender equality. The spreadability function of the hashtag was very impactful for the cause because it allowed for people's messages to reach a wider audience. Through the spread of external information regarding the #MeToo movement empowered by the use of hashtags, has caused for an increase in financial investment towards sexual assault reform. This can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \\"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \\"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \\"BREAKING NEWS: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \\"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.  In popular culture  Two young men displaying the hashtag hand gesture During the April 2011 Canadian party leader debate, Jack Layton, then-leader of the New Democratic Party, referred to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's crime policies as \\"a hashtag fail\\" (presumably #fail). The term \\"hashtag rap\\", coined by Kanye West, was developed in the 2010s to describe a style of rapping that, according to Rizoh of the Houston Press, uses \\"three main ingredients: a metaphor, a pause, and a one-word punch line, often placed at the end of a rhyme\\". Rappers Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Drake, and Lil Wayne are credited with the popularization of hashtag rap, while the style has been criticized by Ludacris, The Lonely Island, and various music writers. On September 13, 2013, a hashtag, #TwitterIPO, appeared in the headline of a New York Times front- page article regarding Twitter's initial public offering. Bird's Eye foods released in 2014 a shaped mashed potato food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called \\"Mashtags\\". Hashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations, such as \\"I'm hashtag confused!\\" In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer wrote in The Guardian that a new hand gesture mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the \\"finger hashtag\\", in which both hands form a peace sign, and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag. The emerging gesture was reported in Wired by Nimrod Kamer, and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by Jimmy Fallon, and on The Colbert Report, among other programs. Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a fad, but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication. In 2019, the British Ornithological Union included as hash character in the design of its new Janet Kear Union Medal, to represent \\"science communication and social media\\". [see attached image for explanation of the hash character] = Adaptations = *Hashflags: In 2010, Twitter introduced \\"hashflags\\" during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. They reintroduced the feature on June 10, 2014, in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and then again on April 10, 2015, with UK political party logos for the 2015 UK General Election. When a user tweets a hashtag consisting of the three letter country code of any of the 32 countries represented in the tournament, Twitter automatically embeds a flag emoticon for that country. A similar system was implemented for the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna, Austria. *Cashtags: In 2009, StockTwits used ticker symbols preceded by the dollar sign to create \\"cashtags\\". In July 2012, Twitter adapted the hashtag style to make company ticker symbols preceded by the dollar sign clickable (as in $AAPL), a method that Twitter dubbed the \\"cashtag\\". This is intended to allow users to search posts discussing companies and their stocks. This is also used for discussion of currency pairings on Twitter, e.g., using #USDGBP or $USDGBP, when mentioning the US Dollar's level expressed in Pounds Sterling.

An acronym for \\"Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School,\\" the Senior CLASS Award focuses on the total student-athlete and encourages them to use their platform in athletics to make a positive impact as leaders in their communities. The awards were sponsored by Lowe's until 2012 and were popularly known as the \\"Lowe's Senior CLASS Awards\\" during this time. History The award was born in 2001 when sportscaster Dick Enberg suggested a national award for senior basketball players during the CBS telecast of the NCAA Final Four championship game. In that game, Shane Battier led Duke to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball title. Battier's decision to turn down the NBA and return for his senior season was one of the media stories of the year in college basketball. Soon after, Premier Sports Management, in partnership with Lowe's, announced the formation of the Senior CLASS Award. Enberg agreed to serve as honorary chair of the award and CBS Sports provided broadcast support, announcing the winner each year during the Final Four telecast. The scope of the award program was expanded the following year with the addition of a women's basketball award, and still further in 2007 with the addition of six NCAA Division I sports: men's and women's soccer, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, softball, and baseball. The Football Bowl Subdivision was added in 2008 and women's volleyball in 2010. The current spokesperson is CBS Sports's Emmy-award- winning sports broadcaster Jim Nantz.

In its early incarnations, it was widely used to generate graphics for television stations, but today is used primarily by the NOAA and related agencies. Users of the McIDAS system developed a similar version for microcomputers and sold by ColorGraphics Weather Systems that generated much of the computerized weather imagery seen on television in the US in the 1980s. HistoryApplications Technology Satellite (ATS) = In 1953 Verner Suomi measured the heat budget of a corn field for his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago.40 Years For the rest of his professional career he worked in the field of remote measuring using radiometers, often working with Robert Parent. They developed a remote sensing radiometer with the intent of flying it into space and measuring the heat budget of the Earth. Their first attempt was fitted to Vanguard TV3, but this exploded on launch. A similar experiment flew on Explorer 7 in 1959. This experiment demonstrated the impact of cloud cover on the heat balance of the Earth. To further develop the field of satellite-based meteorology, NASA and National Science Foundation (NSF) grants led to the creation of the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. At the SSEC, Suomi and Parent developed the Spin Scan Cloudcover Camera (SSCC) to accurately measure and map cloud cover. The SSCC imaged a single strip of the Earth at a time, feeding out its information directly to a radio for broadcast to the ground. Fixed to the body of a rotating satellite, the SSCC would build up a 2D image as the satellite spun and rotated in its orbit. SSCC was launched on ATS-1 on 6 December 1966. On 5 November 1967 ATS-3 launched the Multicolor Spin Scan Cloudcover Camera, which provided the first color meteorological imaging. Data from these instruments was captured on realtime printouts, and required manual work to cut and paste the successive strips into a single image, and then into multiple time-lapse images. Although a number of advances were made while examining this data, the work was tedious and time consuming. =WINDCO= In order to speed up the process of examining the data, Suomi started an internal competition to develop an automated solution. Two teams were set up, one developing an analog solution and another using software. The software solution, by Smith and Phillips, was able to demonstrate the ability to calculate wind speed and direction based solely on the images of the clouds. Based on this success, Suomi was able to gain additional funding from NASA and the NSF to develop a prototype all- computerized image processing system. Known as WINDCO, the system consisted of a video disk for storing imagery and a Raytheon 440 minicomputer controlling it. The computer was used to record the imagery from the satellites, buffering a single frame from the strips and then storing it out along with timing information. The user interacted with the resulting video to select points on the frames that represented the same point as it moved over time, the output of their selections being punched to paper tape. The paper tape was then read by the 440 and copied onto punched cards containing instructions for the UNIVAC 1108 mainframe, which converted them into a vector map overlaid on top of a map of the Earth. At a demonstration to NOAA, NASA and NSF on 12 April 1972, the system demonstrated the ability to generate 1000 wind vectors per hour. The attendees were impressed, but noted that the system was unable to correlate data from the satellites, which originated in a very specific format, with data being collected from other sensors, like automated weather stations. They encouraged the SSEC team to continue development, make the system even more automated, and include the ability to combine data from any source.Lazzara, 272-273 =McIDAS= The biggest problem in developing a fully automated solution was finding a machine within their budget with the speed and storage capabilities required. The team eventually settled on a Datacraft/5 computer equipped with 96 kB of core memory and two 5 MB hard drives, one fixed, one removable. The new software, McIDAS, was much more automated, with the user's primary role in the data acquisition phase reduced to checking the quality of the vectors being automatically generated by the software. An image enhancement system was added to help see the clouds in low- light areas.Lazzara, 273 McIDAS accepted data from a number of sources. Cloud imagery was buffered on tape and then fed in as needed, data from the Synchronous Meteorological Satellite could be fed in directly from a satellite feed at 1.7 MB a second, FAA data at 75 bit/s, or National Weather Service radar at 1200 bit/s. All of this data could be overlaid on hand-drawn vector maps. The system was later extended to support data from the Earth Resources Technology Satellite and the Mariner planetary probes.Lazzara, 274 A command line interpreter allowed the user to call up data with short commands, \`YK T 500 1200 USA\` would generate a display of the 500 mb temperature data from the 1200 UTC measurements over the USA. The first McIDAS system was complete in June 1972, but tuning continued for several months. In October 1973 a real- time feed from McIDAS to the local WHA-TV state public television service was installed. Upgrades and new data feeds continued to be added; local weather radar maps, feeds for the newer generation GOES satellites and others were added by 1976. Demand for the system was so high that the system had to be upgraded several times for additional performance and storage, with 24-hour scheduling for workstations. A system was later installed at the US Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory. Continued demand resulted in the creation of a second-generation version of McIDAS based on six Harris/6 computers connected together using a custom networking system they called \\"burn lines\\". Two of the machines acted as database servers with 300 MB disk drives, while the other four supported up to 18 workstations each with 80 MB drives. Remote terminals inside the University were set up over 9600 bit/s lines, and later another was set up at the National Environmental Satellite Service center in Kansas City, where data from the Landsat series was processed. After a tornado in Wichita Falls, Texas killed several people in 1979, Congress directed that a new McIDAS be set up at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (now known as the Storm Prediction Center), which was completed in January 1981.Lazzara, 277 The West German Space Agency started the task of converting McIDAS to an Amdahl mainframe in 1976, and a similar system was later installed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Newer versions were written for the IBM System/370 and IBM 4331. With the improved performance these machines offered, the distributed architecture of the second-generation McIDAS was no longer needed and systems returned to a single-server installation. In 1984 development started on a standalone version for the IBM PC using EGA or VGA graphics, first on DOS and later on OS/2. These versions spread McIDAS beyond the university and laboratory, and users were soon found at television stations and weather prediction agencies around the world.Lazzara, 281-282 A fourth-generation system, the current version, was built on Unix. This started in 1989 as a McIDAS environment for Vis5D.HibbardSantek In 1993 that McIDAS was the basis for development of a supported version using X, which was released in 1996 as McIDAS-X. With standardized networking, the Unix version allowed low-cost terminals to be attached to the Unix workstations, and client versions for OS/2 and Windows NT were developed.Lazzara, 283 As of December 2009, McIDAS-X is tested and supported by SSEC on AIX, Enterprise Linux, HP- UX, IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows XP workstations.McIDAS-X Supported System Configurations, McIDAS Website, 30 November 2009 The fifth generation of McIDAS is actively being developed. This new package, named McIDAS-V, is a free, open source visualization and data analysis tool that displays weather satellite (including hyperspectral) and other geophysical data in 2- and 3-dimensions. McIDAS-V can also analyze and manipulate the data with its powerful mathematical functions. McIDAS-V is built on SSEC's VisAD and Unidata's Integrated Data Viewer libraries, and contains \\"Bridge\\" software that enables McIDAS-X users to run their commands and tasks in the McIDAS-V environment. The functionality of SSEC's HYDRA software package is also being integrated into McIDAS-V for viewing and analyzing hyperspectral satellite data.About McIDAS, McIDAS Website, 10 February 2009 Current versions of the various McIDAS packages can be downloaded from the McIDAS Download Software page.

It is a sprawling settlement, encompassing several dispersed hamlets and farms: Cajnar, Gmajnar, Jakob, Kr≈°lje, Malen≈°ek, Petelinc, Potoƒçnik, Pri Kaj≈æah, Pristava, Ravni≈°ki Griƒç (or Hru≈°ica), Ste≈æica (or Ste≈°ca), and Zavr≈°e. In the narrow sense (as a hamlet), ≈Ωlebe refers only to the area at the highest part of the valley. The settlement spreads across Tertiary hills and low slopes of dolomite hills separated by ravines with creeks. Zakonj≈°ƒçica Creek is the main watercourse, with its source below Jetrbenk Hill (), and it empties into Mavel≈°ƒçica Creek at Seniƒçica. Tributaries of Zakonj≈°ƒçica Creek include Potoƒçnica Creek (with its source at the Potoƒçnik farm) and Uƒçak Creek (with its source at the Uƒçak farm). Name Zlebe was attested in written sources in 1427 as Slepach. The name is derived from the Slovene common noun ≈æleb 'gorge, ravine', referring to the local geography.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 492. In the past, the settlement was known as Schlebe in German. Locally, the settlement is also known as Sveta Marjeta. Fortifications A fortification formerly stood on Jetrbenk Hill in the southwest part of the settlement. It was owned by the Hertenberg robber knights, who were non-free nobles subservient to the Spanheims, and later to the Patriarchate of Aquileia. The fortification was probably destroyed by the 1511 Idrija earthquake and little trace of it remains today. Gradi≈°ƒçe Hill, which stands below Jetrbenk Hill, was the site of a fortification in antiquity. Churches Bell tower interior, Saint Margaret's Church: mechanized bell and ratchet (left) used during the Paschal Triduum There are two churches above the settlement, one dedicated to Saint Margaret and the other to Saint James. Saint Margaret's Church dates to the early 16th century and was built on the site of an earlier church. The interior was painted with frescos in 1742.RC Church in Slovenia website It is a late Gothic structure and tradition says that it was built with material salvaged from the ruins of the nearby fortress at Jetrbenk Hill. It is a single-nave structure with a star-vaulted nave and sculpted keystones. The frescoes on the triumphal arch date from the 17th century. The main altar was consecrated in the late 17th century, and the altars dedicated to Saint Anthony, Saint James, and the Trinity date from 1666, 1657, and 1646, respectively. The crucifixion group on the arch beam was created in 1680. Saint James' Church was built at the beginning of the 16th century. It is a Baroque structure with the year 1751 on the triumphal arch. The main altar was probably created by (1820‚Äì1884), and the altar dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian dates from the end of the 17th century. It contains the cabinet from a late Gothic winged altar with a statue of Saint James dating from the second half of the 15th century.

An annual conference game between two historically black universities in the Southwestern Athletic Conference, its location usually rotates between JSU's Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium and SU's A. W. Mumford Stadium, but it has also been held at larger venues to accommodate the crowds that the game draws. As of 2019, the Jaguars lead the series 34‚Äì29 (not including two wins that Southern was ordered to vacate by the National Collegiate Athletic Association). History The teams first met on November 30, 1929, a 98‚Äì0 win by Southern. The series was not resumed, and they did not play again until 1958, when Jackson State joined the SWAC. Since then, the conference rivals have played each other every year‚Äîand twice in 1999 and 2013, when Southern defeated Jackson State in SWAC championship games. In fact, both schools are among the most successful SWAC members. Through 2019 Southern has won the second-most SWAC football titles (19), while Jackson State has won the third- most (16). The game draws substantial crowds and has sometimes been played at alternative venues to accommodate the numbers. In 1961 it was played in Mobile, Alabama as part of the second annual \\"Claver Classic.\\" It was played in Baton Rouge's Memorial Stadium in 1978, since it could hold upwards of 25,000 fans, while Southern's stadium could only hold 13,000 at the time. It was played in New Orleans in 2000, 2002, and 2004‚Äîthe latter as part of the then-annual \\"Big Easy Classic\\" series. In 2009 it was also played at Jackson State‚Äôs home stadium to take advantage of the larger capacity. The 2012 game was played as part of the annual \\"W. C. Gorden Classic\\" series. The intense rivalry extends beyond the game itself, featuring a battle between the schools‚Äô well-respected and popular marching bands, Jackson State's \\"Sonic Boom of the South\\" and Southern's \\"Human Jukebox.\\" Hence, the game is commonly referred to by using a portmanteau of the bands' names‚Äîthe BoomBox Classic. The BoomBox battle happens before the game begins and continues after the game has been decided, known as the \\"Zero Quarter\\" and \\"Fifth Quarter\\" respectively in the HBCU community.

He said he reached China from Tawalisi after a voyage of 17 days. The commentators have never been able to decide the port of departure for the 71-day voyage, and so have concentrated on the 17-day voyage from Tawalisi to China.William Henry Scott, Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History, , p.83 Guesses to the location of Tawalisi have included Pangasinan, Luzon, Sulu, Celebes (Sulawesi), Cambodia, Cochin-China, the mainland Chinese province of Guangdong, and practically every island in South Asia beginning with ta.

While the original name of the duchess of the said land was actually spelled in Arabic by Ibn Battuta as WHR DJ in his Rihlah which might be misread as Urduja instead of reading it as Wahre Daja (Bhre Daha) due to the lack of geographical perspective and the lack of knowledge in the Arabic script congruent to the period when it happened. Bhre Daha was a title given to Dayah Wiyat (literally means \\"princess vagina\\"), the twin sister of Bhre Kahuripan, as duchess of Daha (also known as Kediri). Both duchesses were daughters of Raden Wijaya and Gayatri. After the death of Kala Gemet both duchesses assumed power as rajah kembars (twin rulers) and both were given the title Tribhuana tungga dewi (meaning Majapahit empress). Java had been attacked by Mongols they called Tatars for several times, first in the last part of the 13th century A.D. (the 1293 invasion), second during the reign of Kala Gemet. and few more unrecorded invasions. Hence, it is very clear that Java at that time especially the royal court had also been linguistically influenced by the Turkic speaking Tatars. Thus, the Bhre Daha could talk in Turkic as was observed by Ibn Battuta during his visit in her court.Ibn Battuttah, \\"Rihlah\\"; M. C.

The Gunsaulus Mystery is a 1921 American silent race film directed, produced, and written by Oscar Micheaux. The film was inspired by events and figures in the 1913-1915 trial of Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan. The film is now believed to be lost. Plot The body of Myrtle Gunsaulus, a young African-American girl, is discovered in the basement of a New York City factory. Arthur Gilpin, the African-American janitor who discovered the body, is arrested and charged with her murder. Arthur‚Äôs sister Ida May (Evelyn Preer) contacts her former boyfriend, the attorney Sidney Wyeth (Lawrence Chenault), to defend Gilpin in court. During the trial, Wyeth redirects attention for the murder away from Gilpin to Anthony Brisbane, a white man with a history of sexual deviancy. Gilpin is exonerated while Brisbane is revealed as Myrtle Gunsaulus's killer. Production Oscar Micheaux, the most prolific African-American filmmaker of the race film genre, had previously addressed the issue of violence by whites against blacks in his 1920 feature Within Our Gates, which aroused controversy.John W. Ravage, \\"Micheaux, Oscar.\\", BlackPast, accessed December 14, 2010 That film‚Äôs storyline, which included a portrayal of racial lynching and the sexual attack by a white man against a black woman, resulted in censorship rulings in Atlanta and other major cities throughout the U.S.\\"Within Our Gates,\\" AfricanAmericans.com. Micheaux tackled another controversial subject with his 1921 The Gunsaulus Mystery.\\"Overview: The Gunsaulus Mystery\\", New York Times The plot was based on the 1913 murder of Mary Phagan and the trial of Leo Frank.\\" After an African American was first interrogated, police attention turned to Frank, the Jewish-American manager of the factory. He was prosecuted and convicted of the crime. After appeals had failed, he received commutation of his death sentence, but Frank was kidnapped and lynched on August 17, 1915. Micheaux shot The Gunsaulus Mystery at the Estee Studios in New York City and distributed the film through his Micheaux Film Corporation. Evelyn Preer, the star of Within Our Gates, also starred in this production. Micheaux revisited the subject again in 1935 with a sound remake, which was released under the titles Murder in Harlem and Lem Hawkins' Confession. Especially in this version, Micheaux used the conventions of the detective story to introduce differing narratives and rework the binary nature of the trial, in which an African-American man and Jewish-American man had testified against each other.

With hundreds of cities having suffered significant bombing and firestorm damage through aerial attacks and ground war. So, with many men dead or prisoners of war, this monumental task fell to a large degree on women. Degree of damage 3.6 million out of the sixteen million homes in 62 cities in Germany were destroyed during Allied bombings in World War II, with another four million damaged. Half of all school buildings, forty percent of the infrastructure, and many factories were either damaged or destroyed. According to estimates, there were about 400 million cubic metres of ruins (a volume of over 150 Great Pyramid of Gizas) and 7.5 million people were made homeless. Removal of ruins Tr√ºmmerfrauen memorial, Dresden. The Gr√ºner Heiner, a schuttberg in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf Between 1945 and 1946, the Allied powers, in both West Germany and East Germany, ordered all women between 15 and 50 years of age to participate in the postwar cleanup. For this purpose, previous restrictive measures protecting women in the labor force were removed in July 1946. Recruitment of women was especially useful since at that time, because of the loss of men in the war, there were seven million more women than men in Germany. Usually, private enterprises were given assignments to remove the ruins, together with a permit to employ the women for that purpose. The main work was to tear down those parts of buildings that had survived the bombings, but were unsafe and unsuitable for reconstruction. Usually, no heavy machinery was used. The main tools were sledge-hammers, picks, buckets and hand-winches. After tearing down the ruins, the remnants had to be further demolished, down to single bricks that could later be used in rebuilding. A chain of women would transfer the bricks to the street, where they were cleaned and stacked. Wood and steel beams, fireplaces, wash basins, toilets, pipes and other household items were collected to be reused. The remaining debris was then removed by barrows, wagons and lorries. It was later reused to fill up bomb craters & trenches left in the streets or to make new bricks. In some German cities, schuttberge (debris mountains) were created from leftover debris and exist today in a number of German cities. Tr√ºmmerfrauen, both volunteers and regular workers, worked in all weather. They were organised in Kolonnen (columns) of ten to twenty people. = Pay = The average workday of a Tr√ºmmerfrau was nine hours long with one 20-30 minute lunch break. The women were paid at a rate of 72 Reichspfennige (Pfennig) per hour along with one food ration card. This card could only feed one person a day. The issue was not in what one could do once they had the food, but dealt with the fact that the ration card gave very little food. A Tr√ºmmerfrau finished her day with roughly 9 food ration cards and 6 Reichmarks (Marks) and 48 Pfennige. For comparison (1945): One loaf of bread = 80 Marks One pound of butter = 600 Marks One cigarette = 10 Marks Later works and recognition In the Soviet Occupation Zone, the Nationales Aufbauwerk (National Reconstruction Works) was founded, in order to coordinate the efforts of the Tr√ºmmerfrauen. In West Germany, the removal works continued as Notstandsarbeiten (State-of-emergency Works), until the cities were cleaned and the reconstruction could begin. In both parts of Germany, as well as in Austria, the efforts of the Tr√ºmmerfrauen were recognised with numerous ceremonies, memorials, awards and exhibitions. Their role was also considered important in changing post-war gender roles in Germany, though the concept of women as independent workers was taken up more eagerly in the official views of East Germany than in West Germany, where, once peace and economic prosperity was restored, a tendency reemerged in some parts of society to return women to their traditional family role only. Across GermanyAachen= On 4 October 2006, a weekly newspaper published the memoirs of the Tr√ºmmerfrau Elisabeth Stock (83) of which the following passage is cited: \\"...it were mostly women who shoveled their way through the rubble of Aachen's inner city that was totally destroyed; just for one bowl of soup from the Americans, we hammered and dragged debris all day long, even the pickaxe was part of our equipment, ...that's probably one reason why they put a memorial plaque for Aachen's Tr√ºmmerfrauen at the back of the townhall.\\" =Berlin= Within the four occupied sectors of Berlin approximately 10 per cent of the buildings were irreparably destroyed. In the central districts of Berlin Mitte, Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg, Tiergarten, and Wedding up to 30 per cent were destroyed. For this reason, the Tr√ºmmerfrauen had to work hard and their commitment gained widespread recognition: In 1946, the Allied headquarters published a series of stamps, the so-called \\"B√§renmarken\\", for the whole of Berlin. The graphic designers Alfred Goldhammer and Heinz Schwalbe created four images with symbols of the reconstruction, e.g. a bear with a brick, a bear with a shovel, a bear with a beam and a young oak tree in front of the ruins at Belle-Alliance square. On 13 October 1950 the mayor of East-Berlin Friedrich Ebert offered a newly built flat to a former Tr√ºmmerfrau in honour of her commitment. The flat was located in one of the terraces in the street which was formerly called Stalinallee and had been designed by Hans Scharoun. Erika He√ü, mayor of the district of Wedding, initiated the founding of a club for the Tr√ºmmerfrauen. Its members were invited for coffee and cake once a year and also received assistance when they needed to complete official business. In addition, excursions were organised. =Bremen= In May 2005, the Bremen organisation Friedensforum initiated a two-hour meeting under the motto Mother's Day ‚Äì in a different way. Additionally to various activities like music performances or discussion groups etc., a Tr√ºmmerfrau and a pupil met for public discussion. =Chemnitz= In 2001, due to an initiative of the 1998-founded club Verein fig√ºrliches Glockenspiel im Alten Rathaus-Turm zu Chemnitz e.V together with the support of numerous donors, a carillon with a total number of 25 bells was installed. Three times a day the six figures, each one metre tall, come out of the tower. One of them is shaped like a Tr√ºmmerfrau. The rubble woman has a brick on her knee which she holds with her left hand; in her right hand she has a hammer. The figures were designed by the sculptor Johannes (Hannes) Schulze from Plauen and forged by the bell foundry Rudolf Perner Karlsruhe und Passau.  Fashion  In the years of 1945 to 1946, fashion in Berlin began to change at a very quick rate, so fast that it was shortly thereafter labeled the fashion capital. During the war, women sold just about everything they owned for food. This includes the very stockings on their legs and carpets in their homes could be exchanged for a sack of potatoes. Once the Allied soldiers arrived and the long process of clearing the rubble began, the Tr√ºmmerfrauen realized that they could continue to sell the objects they found in other buildings during this time. A large number of rags were pulled out from beneath the debris. A few of the old shop owners pulled out their sewing machines and began to stitch the rags together into dresses. The dresses, were titled, \\"Lumpenkleider\\", meaning \\"rag dresses\\". There were three reasons for the creation of the dresses. First, to give a sense of normalcy and hope that things would one day go back to how they were. Second, dresses immediately after the war served the important purpose of increasing aesthetic, in other words, making the women more appealing to the Allied soldiers. Third, dresses were worth 10,000-20,000 Reichmarks each. The German word \\"Fr√§ulein\\" (at the time) defined a woman that fraternized with a soldier, an act that was strictly forbidden during the war. Upon the war's end, the women had run out of items to barter for food, so they resorted to trading themselves. If a woman could attract the attention of an Allied soldier, she was likely to receive payment in the form of food or in some cases, protection from other men. Fortunate women possessed rag dresses that made them much better at attracting Allied soldiers. The strategy was so beneficial that people began to make many garments out of \\"mitgebrachten stoffen\\" - \\"salvaged material\\". Eventually, many women attained dresses and used prostitution, then tolerated, as a night job while clearing rubble during the day. The busy nights led to a growing entertainment industry where cabarets and bars found themselves populating Berlin. = Negative = A large increase in prostitution between the German women and Allied soldiers led to many contracting venereal diseases. The U.S. government created Veronika Dankesch√∂n (an allusion to \\"Venereal disease\\"), a diseased cartoon seductress starring as the role of a media campaign designed to scare U.S. soldiers into ending sexual relations with German women. As German men returned home they began to call these women prostitutes. Raingard Esser, a doctor of medieval and modern history, believes the men acted so in order to express their anger and strife over the knowledge that their women had to sell themselves to survive, while they, the men, were now also dependent on the women.  Legend  Historian, Leonie Treber, recognizes that many cities and people look to the Tr√ºmmerfrauen as a large movement of heroism and strength. However, she disagrees with the size that people have made it out to be. Berlin mobilized 60,000 women to remove the rubble leftover from the war, yet this number was only five percent of the female population. In areas like Berlin's British sector, Treber reports that the percentage of women who joined in the difficult job had decreased to only a third of one percent. According to the Historian, many saw the job as punishment or beneath them. The reason being that the Nazis made the Hitler Youth, POWs, and concentration camp prisoners remove the debris from the bombed-out cities. Immediately after the war, the members of the Nazi Party were forced to take the place of the forced laborers. Unfortunately, they were insufficient and women stepped up to the task in exchange for an hourly wage and food ration cards. The later use of the Tr√ºmmerfrauen as media campaign representing a large unified movement was very successful in East Germany. The same idea did not travel far in West Germany until the 1980s. Treber states that the reason for this was that the independent tireless woman did not resonate with the \\"conservative female-image\\".

Its two main members were the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, although it had some smaller affiliates. Formation and growth The Teamsters had been expelled from the AFL-CIO in 1957 for corruption.Sloane, Arthur A. Hoffa. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991. .Witwer, David. Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union. Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 2003. The UAW had disaffiliated from the AFL- CIO on July 1, 1968, after UAW President Walter Reuther and AFL-CIO President George Meany could not come to agreement on a wide range of policy issues or reforms to AFL-CIO governance.Lichtenstein, Nelson. The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit: Walter Reuther and the Fate of American Labor. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1995. Although Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons was originally seen as a proxy for jailed Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, Fitzsimmons had begun taking a more leftist stand on a number of public policy issues. Reuther was particularly impressed that Fitzsimmons had been the only other national labor leader present at the funeral of Martin Luther King, Jr. On July 24, 1968, just days after the UAW disaffiliation, Fitzsimmons and Reuther formed the Alliance for Labor Action to organize unorganized workers and pursue leftist political and social projects.Janson, Donald. \\"U.A.W. and Teamsters Form Alliance.\\" New York Times.

While Reuther himself remained active in the ALA, Fitzsimmons assigned Teamsters leader Harold J. Gibbons as his union's liaison. Fitzsimmons and Reuther offered the AFL-CIO a no-raid pact as a first step toward building a working relationship between the competing trade union centers, but the offered was rejected.Flint, Jerry M. \\"No-Raiding Pact Offered Meany.\\" New York Times. November 24, 1968. AFL-CIO President George Meany denounced the ALA as a dual union, although Reuther argued it was not. The ALA later passed a resolution permitting ALA members to raid AFL-CIO unions or organize in jurisdictions claimed by AFL-CIO unions if the AFL-CIO-affiliated union was not doing enough to organize workers into union. Although Reuther had a lengthy list of unions he hoped would join the ALA, few did so. In September 1968, the 110,000-member International Chemical Workers Union (now part of the United Food and Commercial Workers) affiliated with the ALA, and was expelled from the AFL-CIO a year later.\\"Chemical Workers Join Reuther Group.\\" United Press International. September 19, 1968; Stetson, Damon. \\"A.F.L.-C.I.O. Expels the Chemical Workers for Ties to Reuther.\\" New York Times. October 4, 1969. Ten of the largest local unions (representing 40,000 members) belonging to the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union disaffiliated from that international union, formed a new union (the National Council of Distributive Workers of America), and joined the ALA.Stetson, Damon. \\"Local Union of Retail Workers Is Near Split With Parent Body.\\" New York Times. March 21, 1969; \\"New Union Is Formed.\\" Associated Press. May 25, 1969.

The ALA's founding split the American Federation of Teachers, which debated joining but never formally considered such an act.Dewing, Rolland. \\"Is An NEA-AFT Merger Imminent?\\" Peabody Journal of Education. 47:1 (July 1969). Program and dissolution The Alliance's initial program was ambitious.Stetson, Damon. \\"New Labor Group Offers Program.\\" New York Times. May 28, 1969. The two member unions provided the ALA with an annual budget of $4.5 million, the same amount they would have paid to the AFL-CIO in per capita dues. A major organizing drive targeting African American workers was launched in Atlanta, Georgia, in the fall of 1969 involving 50 staff organizers (half of them black), 200 volunteer member-organizers, a $4 million budget, and an extensive public relations campaign.Devinatz, Victor G.\\"'To Find Answers to the Urgent Problems of Our Society': The Alliance for Labor Action's Atlanta Union Organizing Offensive, 1969‚Äì1971.\\" Labor Studies Journal. Summer 2006. But the campaign failed: After 28 months, only 4,590 workers had been organized, and 94 of 196 elections won.The number of organized may be higher. Lichtenstein claims 7,500 workers were unionized. See: Lichtenstein, Nelson. The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit: Walter Reuther and the Fate of American Labor. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1995. The ALA's agenda also included action on a number of progressive issues. It engaged in a widespread community unionism effort. But its attempt to organize blue-collar workers, the poor, and local citizens into community unions was hampered by a lack of experience in community organizing. The ALA program turned into a grant-making operation working through the UAW's existing structure, awarding more than $2.5 million in funds in two and a half years.Bernstein, Harry. \\"Unions, Chart new Political, Social Courses.\\" Los Angeles Times. October 25, 1969. Although it had little organizational involvement in the anti-Vietnam War peace movement,There was some. See: Levy, Peter B. The New Left and Labor in the 1960s. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1994. the ALA called for an immediate end to the war, endorsed anti-war rallies, and its leaders marched in anti-war marches.Foner, Philip S.

The trade union center also supported universal health care, and gave an important early boost to modern efforts to pass federal legislation on the issue.Quadagno, Jill. One Nation, Uninsured: Why the U.S. Has No National Health Insurance. Cambridge, Mass.: Oxford University Press US, 2005. Reuther's death in a plane crash on May 9, 1970, near Black Lake, Michigan, dealt a serious blow to the Alliance. The group halted operations in July 1971 after the Auto Workers (almost bankrupt from a lengthy strike at General Motors) was unable to continue to fund its operations, and the ALA formally disbanded in January 1972.Salpuka, Agis. \\"U.A.W., in Debt, Halts Funds For Alliance With Teamsters.\\" New York Times. July 6, 1971; Salpuka, Agis. \\"A Labor Alliance to Be Dissolved.\\" New York Times. January 25, 1972. The Ford Foundation assumed control over the community grant programs upon the ALA's disestablishment. The UAW re-affiliated with the AFL-CIO on July 1, 1981.Peterson, Iver. \\"After 13 Years, Auto Union Joins A.F.L.-C.I.O. Again.\\" New York Times. July 2, 1981.

Historical assessment Some commentators conclude that the ALA is unimportant, historically. For example, Harold Meyerson argues that \\"the Alliance for Labor Action, alas, never really did anything.\\" Others conclude that it never could have evolved into a major force in the American labor movement: The UAW was no longer a potent political force by 1968, the UAW was on the verge losing half a million members and agreeing to major contract concessions in the auto industry, and neither the UAW nor Teamsters had much organizing capacity (neither had engaged in any significant efforts to organize new members for decades).McNeill, Jim. \\"Work in Progress: The State of the Unions Two Years After the AFL-CIO Split.\\" Dissent. Spring 2007. Other commentators disagree. The ALA, some historians say, gave the anti-war movement a voice for the first time within the labor movement. Although the ALA's own community organizing efforts failed, they encouraged and promoted a long-lasting (if small) community organizing effort in some major cities which survived into the 21st century. Commentators at the time of Reuther's death and a quarter-century later have also concluded that it was Reuther's untimely demise which led to the ALA's failure, rather than anything inherent in its members, structure, or goals.\\"Loss of a Healer.\\" Time.

It is derived from pistolier, a French word for an expert marksman.Universal military dictionary History The earliest kind of pistoleer was the mounted German Reiter, who came to prominence in Europe after the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557. These soldiers were equipped with a number of single-shot, muzzle-loader wheel-lock or Snaphance horse pistols, amongst the most advanced weapons of the era. Although mounted Pistoleers were effective against heavy cavalry, they gradually fell out of use during the Thirty Years War. After this time, cavalry in Western armies used swords or lances as their primary arm, although they still generally carried a pistol as a sidearm.Pistols by Jeff Kinard During the English Civil War, the Roundhead Ironside cavalry were issued with a pair of flintlock pistols. Cavaliers used similar weapons, often ornately decorated, including an early breechloader with a barrel that could be unscrewed.Arms and Armor vol. 10.1, Spring 2013 Before 1700, cavalrymen were recruited from the wealthy gentry, and generally purchased their own nonstandard pistols. The industrial revolution enabled armies to mass-produce firearms with interchangeable parts, and cheaply issue large quantities of standardised firearms to enlisted personnel. However, officers in the British Army and Royal Navy continued to privately commission pistols from London gunsmiths such as Joseph Manton, Robert Wogdon, Henry Nock and Durs Egg until the mid 19th century. Equipment Light cavalry of the early modern period were equipped with a sabre and specialised horse pistols, carried in saddle holsters.Percussion pistols and revolvers These large calibre single shot handguns, also known as holster pistols, horsemen's pistols, cavalry pistols or musket calibre pistols, saw extensive use among the British and French armies during the Napoleonic Wars.Military dictionary 1802 These were deadliest at close range, but massed pistol fire from horseback proved moderately effective at medium range.Pistls by Kinard Many were made in .71, .65 and .58 calibre, to enable the use of standard infantry musket balls.Canadian war museum During the early Victorian era, most horse pistols in the arsenals of Britain, France and America were converted to caplock ignition. These remained in service until .44 calibre revolvers such as the Colt Dragoon of 1847 or the Adams revolver of 1851 were introduced. =British horse pistol= English horse pistols made at the Tower of London used the same lock as the Brown Bess musket.

Although designed for use by cavalry, horse pistols were also issued to mounted staff officers for personal defence, and it was a widespread if unauthorised practice for colour sergeants to carry a pistol in addition to the half-pike and spadroon. After the war, surplus horse pistols were issued to the coast guard, customs officers, and the Metropolitan mounted police.

They are generally designed to transmit on international distress frequencies. Maritime systems have been standardized under the Global Maritime Distress Safety System. History The use of radio to aid in rescuing survivors of accidents at sea came to the forefront after the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. Lifeboats were equipped with spark gap transmitters such as the Marconi Type 241, c. 1920. These operated using Morse code on 500 kHz, the international distress frequency at the time. This frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground-wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships at sea after the Titanic's sinking. However, due to its wavelength of 600 meters, a long antenna was required to achieve good range. Long wires on the order of 1/4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used. Spark-gap continued to be used in lifeboats long after the technology was banned for general communication. =The Gibson Girl= BC-778 \\"Gibson Girl\\" radio transmitter. During World War II, Germany developed a hand-crank 500 kHz rescue radio, the \\"Notsender\\" (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two vacuum tubes and was crystal-controlled. The radio case curved inward in the middle so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the thighs, while the generator handle was turned. The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. United States Army Air Forces aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Nicknamed the Gibson Girl because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame box kite, and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was 500 kHz at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of . Keying could be automatic SOS, or manual. Crystals for frequency control were a scarce item for the U.S. during the war and the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled. A post-World War II version, the AN/CRT-3, which added a frequency in the 8 MHz range, was in use by ships and civil aircraft until the mid 1970s. =VHF era= The use of aircraft for search and rescue in World War II brought line-of-sight VHF radios into use. The much shorter wavelengths of VHF allowed a simple dipole or whip antenna to be effective. Early devices included the British Walter, a compact single vacuum tube oscillator design operating at 177 MHz (1.7 meter wavelength), and the German J√§ger (NS-4), a two-tube master oscillator power amplifierA vacuum tube \\"master oscillator power amplifier\\" radio design combines the functions of an oscillator and amplifier in the same tube or tubes to reduce parts count, weight and power consumption, and improve reliability. design at 58.5 and, later, 42 MHz. These were small enough to include in life rafts used on single-seat fighter aircraft. Post-war designs included the British Search And Rescue And Homing beacon (SARAH) beacon made by Ultra Electronics, used in the location and recovery of astronaut Scott Carpenter after his Mercury space flight, the U.S. AN/URC-4 and the Soviet R 855U. These operated on the aircraft emergency frequencies of 121.5 and 243 MHz (2.5 and 1.2 meter wavelengths). =Automated beacon systems= After a light plane with two U.S. congressmen on board went down in 1972 and could not be found, the U.S. began requiring all aircraft to carry an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) that would turn on automatically in the event of a crash. Initially these units sent beacon signals on the 121.5 MHz aircraft emergency frequency. These are being phased out in favor of ELTs that use a 406.025 MHz signal, which can be picked up by the Cospas-Sarsat international satellite system for search and rescue. Each 406 MHz beacon has a unique digital ID code. Users are required to register the code with the Cospas-Sarsat, allowing inquiries to be made when a distress signal is picked up. Some advanced models can transmit a location derived from an internal GPS or GLONASS receiver. Maritime practice has shifted from rescue radios on 500 kHz distress frequency (which is no longer officially monitored) to the Global Maritime Distress Safety System, which includes use of the Cospas-Sarsat system and other measures, including radar transponders and hand-held marine VHF radios. There are many other types of emergency locator beacons that do not use the 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat system, including man-overboard beacons that transmit Automatic identification system beacons and Avalanche transceivers. U.S. Military survival radios Military organizations still issue pilots and other combat personnel individual survival radios, which have become increasingly sophisticated, with built-in Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Global Positioning Satellite receivers, and satellite communication.

It is maintained by NASA and partners Hewlett Packard Enterprise (formerly Silicon Graphics International) and Intel. As of November 2019 it is ranked the 32nd most powerful computer on the TOP500 list with a LINPACK rating of 5.95 petaflops (5.95 quadrillion floating point operations per second) and a peak performance of 7.09 petaflops from its most recent hardware upgrade. The system serves as NASA's largest supercomputing resource, supporting missions in aeronautics, human spaceflight, astrophysics, and Earth science. History Anatomy of a Pleiades node, shown on display at the NASA Ames Exploration Center, in Mountain View, California Built in 2008 and named for the Pleiades open star cluster, the supercomputer debuted as the third most powerful supercomputer in the world at 487 teraflops. It originally contained 100 SGI Altix ICE 8200EX racks with 12,800 Intel Xeon quad-core E5472 Harpertown processors connected with more than 20 miles of InfiniBand double data rate (DDR) cabling. With the addition of ten more racks of quad-core X5570 Nehalem processors in 2009, Pleiades ranked sixth on the November 2009 TOP500 with 14,080 processors running at 544 teraflops. In January 2010, the scientists and engineers at NAS successfully completed a \\"live integration\\" of another ICE 8200 rack by connecting the new rack's InfiniBand dual port fabric via 44 fibre cables while the supercomputer was still running a full workload, saving 2 million hours in productivity that would otherwise have been lost. Another expansion in 2010 added 32 new SGI Altix ICE 8400 racks with Intel Xeon six-core X5670 Westmere processors, bringing up to 18,432 processors (81,920 cores in 144 racks) at a theoretical peak of 973 teraflops and a LINPACK rating of 773 teraflops. NASA also put an emphasis on keeping Pleiades energy efficient, increasing the power efficiency with each expansion so that in 2010 it was three times more power-efficient than the original 2008 components, which were the most power-efficient at the time. The integration of the six-core Westmere nodes also required new quad data rate (QDR) and hybrid DDR/QDR InfiniBand cabling, making the world's largest InfiniBand interconnect network with more than 65 miles of cable. After another 14 ICE 8400 racks containing Westmere processors were added in 2011, Pleiades ranked seventh on the TOP500 list in June of that year at a LINPACK rating of 1.09 petaflops, or 1.09 quadrillion floating point operations per second. InfiniBand DDR and QDR fiber cables are used to connect the all of nodes to each other, as well as to the mass storage systems at NAS and the hyperwall visualization system, creating a network made up of more than 65 miles of InfiniBand fabric, the largest of its kind in the world. Pleiades is built in a partial 11-D hypercube topology, where each node has eleven connections to eleven other nodes, with some making up to twelve connections to form a 12-D hypercube. In 2012, NASA and partners SGI and Intel began working on the integration of 24 new Altix ICE X racks with Intel Xeon eight-core E5-2760 Sandy Bridge processors to replace 27 of the original Alitx 8200 racks containing quad-core Harpertown processors. With a total of 126,720 processor cores and over 233 terabytes of RAM across 182 racks, the expansion increased Pleiades' available computing capacity 40 percent. Each new Sandy Bridge node has four networking links using fourteen data rate (FDR) InfiniBand cable for a total transfer bandwidth of 56 gigabits (about 7 gigabytes) per second. In early 2013, work began on a larger hardware refresh for Pleiades, ultimately removing all of the original 4-core Harpertown processors and adding 46 SGI ICE X racks with 10-core Intel Xeon E5-2680V2 (Ivy Bridge) processors. When installation was complete in August 2013, the system's overall peak performance increased 62% from 1.78 petaflops to 2.87 petaflops. The system was slowly upgraded again between January and April 2014, adding another 29 racks of Ivy Bridge nodes and increasing the system's theoretical computational capability to 3.59 petaflops. To make room for the expansion, all of the system's remaining Nehalem nodes and 12 Westmere nodes were removed. In late 2014, more Westmere nodes were removed to make room for new Intel Xeon Haswell processors, increasing the theoretical processing power by one petaflop to 4.49 petaflops. In January 2015, additional Haswell nodes were installed and released to users, giving Pleiades a new peak theoretical processing capacity of 5.35 petaflops. An upgrade, completed in June 2016, replaced all remaining racks containing nodes with six-core Intel Xeon X5670 (Westmere) processors with racks containing nodes using 14-core Intel Xeon E5-2680v4 (Broadwell) processors. This improved the theoretical peak performance to 7.25 petaflops. Role at NASA Pleiades is part of NASA's High-End Computing Capability (HECC) Project and represents NASA's state-of- the-art technology for meeting the agency's supercomputing requirements, enabling NASA scientists and engineers to conduct high-fidelity modeling and simulation for NASA missions in Earth studies, space science, aeronautics research, as well as human and robotic space exploration. Some of the scientific and engineering projects run on Pleiades include: * The Kepler Mission, a space observatory launched in March 2009 to locate Earth-like planets, monitors a section of space containing more than 200,000 stars and takes high-resolution images every 30 minutes. After the operations center gathers this data, it is pipelined to Pleiades in order to calculate the size, orbit, and location of the planets surrounding these stars. As of February 2012, the Kepler mission has discovered 1,235 planets, 5 of which are approximately Earth-sized and orbit within the \\"habitable zone\\" where water can exist in all three forms (solid, liquid, gas). After setbacks following the failure of two of Kepler's four reaction wheels, responsible for keeping the spacecraft pointed in the correct direction, in 2013, the Kepler team moved the entire data pipeline to Pleiades, which continues to run light curve analyses from the existing Kepler data. * Research and development of next generation space launch vehicles is done on Pleiades using cutting-edge analysis tools and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation in order to create more efficient and affordable space launch system and vehicle designs. Research has also been done on reducing noise created by the landing gear of aircraft using CFD code application to detect where the sources of noise are within the structures. * Astrophysics research into the formation of galaxies is run on Pleiades to create simulations of how our own Milky Way Galaxy was formed and what forces might have caused it to form in its signature disk-shape. Pleiades has also been the supercomputing resource for dark matter research and simulation, helping to discover gravitationally bound \\"clumps\\" of dark matter within galaxies in one of the largest simulations ever done, in terms of particle numbers. * Visualization of the Earth's ocean currents using a NASA-built data synthesis model for the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) Project between MIT and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. According to NASA, the \\"ECCO model-data syntheses are being used to quantify the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle, to understand the recent evolution of the polar oceans, to monitor time-evolving heat, water, and chemical exchanges within and between different components of the Earth system, and for many other science applications.\\" Gallery File:Pleiades supercomputer outside view.jpgPleiades supercomputer outside view File:Pleiades two row.jpgPleiades Westmere-based racks.

In 2005, Aliquippa School District administration reported that 257 pupils or 18.7% of the district's pupils received special education services, with 27% having a specific learning disability.Pennsylvania Department of Education Bureau of Special Education, Aliquippa School District Special Education Data Report 2005, December 2006 In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts, like Aliquippa School District, have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Aliquippa School District received a $1,074,119 supplement for special education services in 2010.

This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Aliquippa School District will receive an increase to $1,097,913 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students.

The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Aliquippa School District was $57,382 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $22,159 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $79,541.

In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. According to then Governor Rendell, failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Aliquippa School District School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program.

Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75 and 85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 ‚Äì 33.8500 mills for buildings and 212.00 mills for land.Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Finance reports, July 2013 *2012-13 ‚Äì 33.0000 mills for buildings and 207.00 mills for land. *2011-12 ‚Äì 32.5000 mills for buildings and 202.00 mills for land.Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Finance reports, July 2011 *2010-11 ‚Äì 32.0000 mills for buildings and 198.0000 mills for land. *2009-10 ‚Äì 31.0000 mills for buildings and 195.0000 mills for land. *2008-09 ‚Äì 29.5000 mills for buildings and 188.0000 mills for land. *2007-08 ‚Äì 28.0000 mills for buildings and 177.0000 mills for land.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì12 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

Wellness policy Aliquippa School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246.Aliquippa School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age-appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K‚Äì12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The Superintendent is required to report annually to the Board regarding this policy and the associated issues. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

The borough of Woodlawn was incorporated from Hopewell Township in 1908. Its population drawn to the area by the establishment of the Aliquippa Works of Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation along the Ohio River. According to historian Ivagean Ferry, from whose \\"Brief History of Education in Aliquippa\\" much of the information in this account has been taken, two districts had been in operation in the area ‚Äì the Logstown Independent District and the Aliquippa School District. In 1928 Aliquippa was renamed West Aliquippa when it consolidated with the town of Woodlawn, the larger borough, which at that time took the Indian name of Aliquippa.\\" The Woodlawn District in 1909 elected its first Board of School Directors: H. J. Johns, president; John T. Bell, secretary; W. G. Cochran (a non-member), treasurer; and members, C. H. Dinsmore, G. Walter Prosser, G. W. Gray, and J. H. Robb. The challenge to the district, headed by Calvin Springer, was finding classrooms for its 225 pupils. They were housed in the Woodlawn Academy, the old Logstown School, and a room in the Dinsmore house on Hopewell Avenue. The ten-room Highland School was the first neighborhood school erected. In 1911 the eight-room Logstown School was constructed. Woodlawn High School, a two-story building of twelve rooms, opened in 1913. Laughlin School was built in 1917; Jones School was erected in 1919 by that time the student population was 2,000. The first high school students of Woodlawn had been housed in elementary schools or sent to Beaver for senior classes and graduation. In 1913 the first senior class was graduated from the Logstown Building and the first class to be graduated from Woodlawn High School was the class of 1914. In 1921, Woodlawn withdrew from Beaver County supervision and became an independent district, headed by Superintendent 0. H. Locke. Less than ten years after the construction of Woodlawn High School, a new high school was erected on a hilltop overlooking Franklin Avenue. With its 34 classrooms, laboratories and offices, the high school was completed in 1925. A second building phase followed: the construction of a gymnasium- auditorium and the first part of a vocational shop on the hill above the school. Named Harding High School, in 1930 it was renamed the Aliquippa High School which would serve the community for more than 80 years until its closure in 2009 and subsequent demolition a year later. In 1925 Aliquippa Borough annexed neighboring New Sheffield from Hopewell Township. Spaulding School, which had been newly built by the Hopewell Township School District, was transferred to the possession of the Aliquippa School District. The ten- room New Sheffield School was constructed in 1931 and still serves the community today. At the other end of the town, the McDonald School was built in 1940. The school population had grown to 6,600 students by 1929. Because the district could not provide new schools immediately, in 1928, all-year- round school was the district's answer to the problem. As Mrs. Ferry explains, the all-year-round plan \\"set up four quarters of twelve weeks each ... The distribution of enrollment was made so that three-fourths of the children were in school and one-fourth on vacation each quarter.\\" In 1958 a new junior high school was built with a capacity of 1,200 which allowed the district to relocate all junior high students out of the elementary schools while also moving students out of the aging Franklin Junior High School (originally Woodlawn High School). With the sixties came serious challenges. Late in the decade, racial unrest led to upheavals in the junior and senior high schools and to the temporary closing of the schools in 1970. A comprehensive survey of the community and its schools was made and the district set up a study team of members of the National Education Association and the state and Pittsburgh chapters of the N.A.A.C.P., which met with the city's bi-racial Human Relations Committee to try to find solutions. Lawrence M. Maravich, elected superintendent in 1966, reported on policies being put into practice to promote equality of opportunity. It was found imperative to put the child first, not the curriculum. To desegregate the schools, Aliquippa changed its organizational structure and grouped classes into three units: for elementary school, K‚Äì4, for middle school, 5‚Äì8, for high school, 9‚Äì12. The Highland, Logstown, Jones, Laughlin, Spaulding and Franklin elementary schools were all closed and its students were sent to New Sheffield School which became the districts only elementary school. Rather unexpectedly, in the eighties came the collapse of the industry that had created and nourished the community. LTV Steel, the successor to the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company which built Aliquippa, closed most of the Aliquippa Works in 1984 which saw over 5,000 workers lose their jobs. The school district suffered devastating effects including the loss of most of its tax base, declining enrollment, increased poverty and significant cuts to programs and curriculum due to budget cuts. From a peak of 6,600 in the early 1930s enrollment declined to 1,779 in 1987. In an effort to cut costs and consolidate students the less than 30-year-old junior high school was closed, grades 5 and 6 were relocated to the elementary school and grades 7 and 8 were sent to the high school. This lasted less than a decade when due to overcrowding the junior high was reopened in the mid 1990s and was renamed Aliquippa Middle School. The district continued to face problems into the 2000s as enrollment and tax revenue declined further and the district's facilities continued to age. The high school, in particular, had been slowly deteriorating for years and had gotten to a point where portions of the building had to be closed off to protect students. Beginning in the 2007-08 school year a massive remodeling and renovation project was begun at the elementary and middle schools and grades were once again realigned with grades kindergarten thru 6th being moved to Aliquippa Elementary and 7th thru 12th being moved to middle school which would become the new Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School. The old high school, which served the community for 85 years and had become a symbol for Aliquippeans for decades, was closed with the Class of 2009 being the last to graduate from the building.

The novel, written in a stream-of- consciousness style reminiscent of the English-language Modernists, centers on the childhood and early adulthood of a character named Joana, who bears strong resemblance to her author: \\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi\\", Lispector said, quoting Flaubert, when asked about the similarities. The book, particularly its revolutionary language, brought its young, unknown creator to great prominence in Brazilian letters and earned her the prestigious Gra√ßa Aranha Prize. It has been translated into English twice, the first by Giovanni Pontiero in 1990,Giovanni Pontiero (Translator), Near to the Wild Heart, New Directions (September 17, 1990). and again by Alison Entrekin in 2012.Alison Entrekin (Translator), Benjamin Moser (Preface). Near to the Wild Heart, New Directions (May 8, 2012). Background and publication When Lispector began writing, in March 1942, she was still a law student at the Faculdade Nacional de Direito (National Law School), and was also working as a journalist. In February, she had transferred to the newspaper A Noite (The Night), once one of the glories of Brazilian journalism but by then under the direction of the dictatorial Get√∫lio Vargas government. She had published some stories and journalism, and turned to one of her colleagues, Francisco de Assis Barbosa, for help with the novel she had begun writing. She pieced the book together by jotting down her ideas in a notebook whenever they occurred to her. To concentrate, she quit the tiny maid‚Äôs room in the apartment she shared with her sisters and brother-in-law and spent a month in a nearby boardinghouse, where she worked intensely. At length the book took shape, but she feared it was more a pile of notes than a full-fledged novel. Her great friend L√∫cio Cardoso, a slightly older novelist, assured her that the fragments were a book in themselves. Barbosa read the originals chapter by chapter, but Clarice vividly rejected his occasional suggestions: ‚ÄúWhen I reread what I‚Äôve written,‚Äù she told him, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm swallowing my own vomit.‚Äù Cardoso suggested a title, borrowed from James Joyce‚Äôs Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: ‚ÄúHe was alone. He was unheeded, happy, and near to the wild heart of life.‚Äù This became the book‚Äôs epigraph, which, together with the occasional use of the stream-of-consciousness method, led certain critics to describe the book as ‚ÄúJoycean.‚Äù The comparison annoyed Lispector, who had not read Joyce; instead, the book bears the much more distinctive mark of Spinoza, whom she had been reading at the time she wrote it. Cover art by Julia Robinson Barbosa, who together with Cardoso was one of the book‚Äôs first readers, recalled his amazement. ‚ÄúAs I devoured the chapters the author was typing, it slowly dawned on me that this was an extraordinary literary revelation,‚Äù Barbosa said. ‚ÄúThe excitement of Clarice, hurricane Clarice.‚Äù He steered it to the book-publishing wing of their employer, A Noite, where it appeared with a bright pink cover, typical for books by women, in December 1943. It was not a lucrative arrangement for the new author. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have to pay anything [to have it published], but I didn‚Äôt make any money either. If there was any profit, they kept it,‚Äù Lispector said. A thousand copies were printed; in lieu of payment, she got to keep a hundred. As soon as the book was ready, she began sending the book out to critics. Plot summary Near to the Wild Heart does not have a conventional narrative plot. It instead recounts flashes from the life of Joana, between her present, as a young woman, and her early childhood. These focus, like most of Lispector's works, on interior, emotional states. The book opens with a scene of the child Joana playing in the garden, making up poems for her father. Joana's wildness and barely suppressed violence, along with her linguistic creativity, are her most notable features. She is frequently compared to animals: over the course of the book Lispector compares her to a bird, a snake, a wildcat, a horse, and a dog. She commits transgressive acts‚Äîas a child she throws a book at an old man's head, for example, and as a married woman she leaves her husband, Ot√°vio, and greets the news of his adultery‚Äîhe has made another woman, his old friend L√≠dia, pregnant‚Äîwith utter indifference. She is not so much immoral as she is amoral: ‚ÄúEvil is not living, and that‚Äôs it. Dying is already something else. Dying is different from good and evil.‚Äù In the book, she cites long passages from Spinoza, the longest quotes that appear anywhere in her novels; it seems that she felt an affinity with the Dutch philosopher's amoral conception of the world. Literary significance and criticism Near to the Wild Heart was greeted as a revolution in Brazilian literature, though it was very rarely compared to the work of any Brazilian writer. Critics mentioned James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Marcel Proust, Andr√© Gide, and Charles Morgan. The reason seems to be that its language sounded completely un-Brazilian, as the poet L√™do Ivo wrote: ‚ÄúClarice Lispector was a foreigner. ‚Ä¶ The foreignness of her prose is one of the most overwhelming facts of our literary history, and even of the history of our language.‚Äù > I met Clarice Lispector at the exact moment that she published Near to the > Wild Heart. The meeting took place in a restaurant in Cinel√¢ndia. We had > lunch and our conversation strayed from literary matters. ‚Ä¶ The least I can > say is that she was stunning. It was autumn, the leaves in the square were > falling, and the grayness of the day helped underscore the beauty and > luminosity of Clarice Lispector. Alongside the foreign climate was that > strange voice, the guttural diction which rings in my ears to this day. At the time, Ivo called it \\"the greatest novel a woman had ever written in the Portuguese language\\". page = 49} Other reviews were as enthusiastic. For almost a year after publication, articles about the book appeared continuously in every major city in Brazil. ‚ÄúThe whole book is a miracle of balance, perfectly engineered,‚Äù combining the ‚Äúintellectual lucidity of the characters of Dostoevsky with the purity of a child.‚Äù A Manh√£ (The Morning), not going quite as far as L√™do Ivo, had declared it to be ‚Äúthe greatest debut novel a woman had written in all of Brazilian literature.‚Äù Awards and nominations In October 1944, the book won the prestigious Gra√ßa Aranha Prize (Pr√™mio Gra√ßa Aranha) for the best debut novel of 1943. The prize was a confirmation of what the Folha Carioca had discovered earlier that year when it asked its readers to elect the best novel of 1943. Near to the Wild Heart won with 457 votes: a spectacular number, considering that only nine hundred copies had actually been put on sale. Influence The third studio album by the Canadian rock duo Japandroids is called Near to the Wild Heart of Life in homage to Clarice Lispector's novel. American dream pop band Dollshot named their second album and its title track single Lalande after the word and associated passage in Near to the Wild Heart. The book has been published as part of the complete works of Clarice Lispector by New Directions under the editorial direction of Benjamin Moser.

Biography Beatrice received a good education at her father's court in Naples. She was engaged in 1474 and married Matthias in Hungary 22 December 1476: she was crowned Queen of Hungary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The marriage secured an alliance between Hungary and Naples: In 1480, when an Ottoman fleet seized Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples, at the earnest solicitation of the pope he sent the Hungarian general, Blaise Magyar, to recover the fortress, which surrendered to him on 10 May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took Ancona under his protection for a while, occupying it with a Hungarian garrison. Beatrice exerted some influence in the policy of Hungary. She also had a cultural importance by introducing the Italian renaissance into the court of Hungary, an interest she shared with Matthias: she encouraged his work with the Bibliotheca Corviniana, built the palace Visegr√°d as a residence for the court, and created an Academy. She wished to participate in policy: in 1477, she accompanied Matthias during the invasion of Austria, and in 1479, she was present during the peace treaty between Matthias and Vladislaus II. In 1479, their relationship became tense when Matthias awarded his illegitimate son John (J√°nos) Corvinus with a fief and invited John's mother, Barbara Edelpock, to court. Matthias died before Beatrice ever conceded that his son J√°nos should be the rightful heir. Upon his death in 1490, Beatrice managed to keep a power position by the support of the Hungarian nobility and continue as queen of Hungary by marriage to the next monarch. After the death of Matthias Corvinus, she wrote a letter to Simon Keglevich; she addressed this letter to king Simon Keglevich, then only the commander of Matthias Corvinus. She offered him to become as a mother to his children. He declined this offer; he delivered this letter to the parliament, and he became the ambassador of the parliament to the king. She presided as a royal representative at the parliament where the next king was elected, with the Hungarian crown placed at her side. It is believed she could not control Janos and was claimed illegitimate by her second husband but these claims all cannot be verified nor can they be completely ignored. Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary wrote in the same year 1490 many letters with the same text to many of the Hungarian nobility. He wrote that Beatrice had written to him, that Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice had decided that Stephen Z√°polya, the father of John Z√°polya, should become the next duke of Austria after Matthias Corvinus. Beatrice married her second husband, Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, in 1491. Beatrice had great support by the Hungarian nobility, and the nobility had demanded of Vladislav that he marry her. This marriage was yet again childless. Formally, the marriage was questioned, as her spouse was not granted a divorce from his first wife by the pope. Her husband claimed that he did not regard the marriage as legal, and that he had been forced to marry her against his will, and in 1493, a commission was issued to investigate. In 1500, the pope declared the marriage to be illegal, and Beatrice was forced to pay the costs of the trial. Beatrice returned to Naples, where she arrived in 1501, and in 1502 Vladislaus could marry Anne of Foix-Candale. Beatrice died in Naples. AncestryNotes References  * J.

Early life Douglas was born in Smethwick, Staffordshire, the oldest son of Sir Charles Fox and had two brothers and a sister. Sir Charles was a civil engineer and had designed, amongst other things, The Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Douglas was educated at Cholmondeley School, also known as Highgate School, from 1851 to 1854 and King's College School from 1854 to 1855. He studied at King's College London from 1855 to 1857 and was to have studied further at Trinity College, Cambridge but the financial collapse of his father's contracting company in 1857 ended his education. Douglas was instead articled to his father who had set up an engineering consultancy, Sir Charles Fox and Sons. Douglas was a member of the Church of England and was active in the Church Mission Society as well as being the author of several academic papers. He married Mary Wright in 1863 with whom he had one son and four daughters. Early engineering projects The Grosvenor Bridge, London In 1863 Douglas was made a partner and by 1865 the firm was involved in major projects in Britain, the USA, Canada, southern Africa, India, Australia, and South America. From 1863 to 1866 Douglas and his father worked on the design of the railway viaducts and bridges at Battersea which would separate the lines coming from Waterloo from those from Victoria. This process also included the widening of Grosvenor Bridge from two to seven tracks. Military service Douglas served as an officer in the Volunteer Force London Rifle Volunteer Brigade and was commissioned as an Ensign in that unit on 17 June 1861. He received promotion to Lieutenant in that unit, since renamed the London Rifle Volunteer Corps, on 18 November 1863. During this period Douglas held several patents including one for \\"improvements in machinery for nicking and dressing the heads of screw-blanks\\" which was approved on 28 April 1868, one for \\"improvements in the manufacture of method of repairing railway rails and other iron in a permanent way and in the machinery to be employed therein\\" on 30 July 1868 and one for \\"improvements in screw cutting and threading machines and in the construction of screw nails and spikes\\" on 30 April 1866. The latter two patents expired after a seven-year period for non-payment of stamp duty required for a patent extension. Douglas was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers by 1873. Douglas Fox & Partners The Snowdon Mountain Railway Victoria Falls Bridge, 1905 The family firm remained solely a father and son enterprise until Sir Charles' death in 1874 upon which Douglas became senior partner of what was now Douglas Fox & Partners. At this stage Douglas' brother Francis also became a partner of the firm. Douglas was involved with the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway and the extension of the Great Central Railway from Rugby to London including the terminal at Marylebone Station. He worked on several of London's early tube lines including the Great Northern and City tube, the Hampstead tube which linked Charing Cross with Golders Green and Highgate, and the unsuccessful North West London Railway project. Douglas was, with James Greathead, joint engineer of the Liverpool Overhead Railway which was the first electric elevated city railway in the world.. Further afield Douglas was involved with the design of much of the Cape Colony railways, the whole Rhodesia railway system, which included the 500 ft span Victoria Falls Bridge, the Benguela Railway in Angola, and several railways in South America. The firm were consulting engineers to the Central Argentine Railway; the South Indian Railway; the Southern S√£o Paulo Railway and the Dorada Railway. Sir Ralph Freeman, one of the firm's chief engineers, most notably worked on the Victoria Falls Bridge (1905) and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932). Freeman rose to become senior partner, and in 1938 the firm changed its name to Freeman Fox & Partners, and later Acer Freeman Fox. Following several mergers, the firm is now part of Hyder Consulting. Honours and awards On 8 March 1886 Douglas was knighted at Windsor Castle by Queen Victoria for his work with James Brunlees on the Mersey Railway Tunnel and a railway linking Birkenhead with Liverpool. In 1887 he was made an honorary fellow of his alma mater, King's College London and from November 1899 to November 1900 served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.. Death He died on 13 November 1921 in Kensington, at the home of one of his daughters; Mary had died the year before. The firm became Freeman, Fox and Partners in 1938 after Ralph Freeman, who had worked for the firm since 1901, became a partner.. In 1988 it became Acer Freeman Fox and is now known as Hyder Consulting (since taken over by Dutch-based Arcadis.

HistoryOrigins= The hospital seems to have been so-called because of its location to the west of the landscaped parkland formerly associated with Horton Manor (later the Manor Hospital). Although sometimes called an 'asylum' by urban explorers and the media, West Park was never officially termed as such, having opened as West Park Mental Hospital in 1923. The term had largely fallen out of favour by the 1920s and was made obsolete in law by the Mental Treatment Act 1930. =Design and construction= The hospital was designed by William C. Clifford-Smith (architect to the London County Council), who was also involved in the design of nearby St Ebba's and The Manor Hospitals. The hospital had been in planning since 1906, and by 1917 it was largely complete; however, the outbreak of war postponed opening until 1921. The hospital was the last great London mental hospital, and the last of the Epsom Cluster. =Operation= When complete the hospital could cater for around 2,000 patients of mixed class. The site had extensive boiler houses and plant rooms, a large laundry and a substantial water tower. There were also large kitchens located behind the canteen and a substantial recreation hall or ballroom (the latter suffered an arson attack on 30 September 2003 and is now a burnt out shell). The hospital was also once served by the Horton Estate's own railway but this was removed in 1950 and no trace remains except around the central engineering block. =Decline and redevelopment= The hospital was slowly run down from the mid-1990s, and by 2003 most of the hospital was closed and derelict, although some buildings, including the New Epsom and Ewell Cottage Hospital remain in use by NHS healthcare services. Because of its derelict state, it came to be of interest to urban explorers who were attracted by the sheer size of the buildings and also the many hospital items still in situ, such as beds, kitchen equipment and personal items. A padded cell also remained in-situ and was of considerable interest to explorers. In November 2010, demolition began of the former hospital buildings. As of April 2011, most of the central buildings had been cleared with only a limited number of wards, the water tower and administration building being retained for conversion to apartments. These are to be incorporated into Noble Park, a new housing development which is currently being built on the site. Gallery Image:WP hall.JPGThe burnt out remains of the Main Hall.

Located in New York City on the university's Morningside Heights campus, its collections span more than 4,000 years, from early Mesopotamia to the present day, and span a variety of formats: cuneiform tablets, papyri, and ostraca, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, early printed books, works of art, posters, photographs, realia (such as mathematical instruments and theater models), sound and moving image recordings, and born-digital archives. Areas of collecting emphasis include American history, Russian and East European √©migr√© history and culture, Columbia University history, comics and cartoons, philanthropy and social reform, the history of mathematics, human rights advocacy, Hebraica and Judaica, Latino arts and activism, literature and publishing, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, oral history, performing arts, and printing history and the book arts. History One of two RBML reading rooms The Chang Octagon in RBML =1754-1899= Columbia University was founded by royal charter as King‚Äôs College in 1754. A group of over one hundred titles from the original King's College Library survived the American Revolution, and are now part of the historic Columbiana Collection. The college exhibited an interest in acquiring significant books early in its history during the presidency of William A. Duer (in office 1829-1842) when it subscribed to the elephant folio edition of John James Audubon's The Birds of America, published from 1827 to 1838. Columbia was one of only three American educational institutions to have acquired this now famous work as it was released. The 1881 bequest of Stephen Whitney Phoenix, the well-travelled scion of a New York merchant family, noted genealogist, and college alumnus, brought Columbia its first collector's library, around seven thousand rare editions and manuscripts. Particular highlights of the Phoenix gift include a 15th century French Book of Hours, a Jean Grolier bound Aldine edition of philosopher Iamblichus‚Äô works, Shakespeare‚Äôs First Folio, and original drawings by inventor Robert Fulton. Professor of Semitic Languages Richard J.H. Gottheil arranged the gift by Temple Emanu-el of New York City of its distinguished library of 2,500 printed books and fifty manuscripts of Hebraica in 1892, which placed Columbia‚Äôs Judaica collection among the top in the country. Four years after the Temple Emanu-El gift, in 1896, Columbia President Seth Low (in office 1890-1901), decided to make the College a University and to further expand the library so that it could support graduate level research. =1900-1929= Around the turn of the century, a bibliographer was hired to buy out-of-print books, curate exhibitions, and teach. This was an early step in thinking about the special collections in the library which would lead in 1930 to the creation of the Rare Book & Manuscript Library. The beginning of the active acquisition of collections of original manuscripts, autograph letters and documents was marked by Trustee William Schermerhorn's gift in 1902 of New York Governor De Witt Clinton‚Äôs papers. Professor of Dramatic Literature Brander Matthews began to transfer his collection to Columbia in 1912, which later would grow and gain international renown as the Dramatic Museum collection. Two years later, the descendents of the college‚Äôs first president, Samuel Johnson (in office 1754-1763), and of his son, the college‚Äôs the third president, William Samuel Johnson (in office 1787-1800), presented the two men‚Äôs libraries as gifts to the university, supplementing the Columbiana Collection. The next large collection given to the Library was the Jeanne d‚ÄôArc collection. Assembled by alumnus and historian of religion Acton Griscom and donated by him in 1920, it consists of several thousand books and manuscripts concerned with the heroine of French history. From 1924-1928 Columbia‚Äôs first Accounting Professor, Robert H. Montgomery, presented his collection on the history of accountancy. Among its manuscript holdings are a ledger-daybook kept by Josiah Winslow in the Plymouth Colony from 1696 to 1759, and the account book of the English sculptor John Flaxman from 1809 to 1826. In 1928 book collector, mathematician and Teacher‚Äôs College Professor David Eugene Smith, along with his friend, publisher George Arthur Plimpton, founded the Friends of the Libraries, the second such organization in the United States (the first was founded at Harvard in 1925) and one that would help to drive the growth of Columbia‚Äôs special collections for decades to come. The first major effort of the University to acquire a collection of rare research material by purchase occurred a year later, when the university bought the internationally known library on the history of economics assembled by Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman. The purchase of the Seligman library marked the beginning of the spectacular growth of the library during the 1930s. =1930-1945= On July 1, 1930, the Rare Book Department was established with Trustee approval, and Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt became its director from 1930 until 1939. Just before the official formation of the Department, textile industry magnate and ardent opponent of the metric system, Samuel S. Dale donated his library on weights and measures, which was accepted by trustees on June 3, 1930. Professor David Eugene Smith began to donate his collection on the history of mathematics, which included a diverse range of material acquired on trips to Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and the Far East, in 1931. In turn, Smith‚Äôs generosity encouraged George Plimpton to donate his library. The Plimpton library, which had been in part placed on deposit in 1932, was formally presented in 1936, and contained more than sixteen thousand volumes on the history of education. The three hundred and seventeen medieval and renaissance manuscripts from these collections form the largest such group in the library. In 1933, Salo Baron, the first professor of Jewish History at Columbia, arranged for the purchase of approximately 700 Judaica manuscripts for the collection. In 1941, the seed of the graphic arts collection was planted when Henry Lewis Bullen, the Australian-born founder of the American Type Founders Company, sold Columbia that institution‚Äôs library after the company went bankrupt. It included one of only three American copies of Peter Schoeffer‚Äôs landmark Canon missae (1458). At the time, Bullen claimed that the American Type Founders Company collection was ‚Äúby far the most complete and effective collection in existence relating to the arts of the book.‚Äù The following year Professor of Latin and Greek at Teachers College, Gonzalez Lodge, gifted his collection of works by classical authors, which included more than one hundred incunabula. By 1942, the foundation of Columbia‚Äôs rare book collections had been laid. As early as 1940, the department was operating under the name ‚ÄúSpecial Collections,‚Äù and had two separate reading rooms, one for manuscripts and the other for rare books. In 1946, the name of the division was officially changed from the Rare Book Department to the Department of Special Collections when Roland O. Baughman (in office 1946-1967) was appointed its head, succeeding Charles Adams (in office 1939-1945). =1945-1990= In the years following World War II, the understanding of what constituted a ‚Äúspecial collection‚Äù began to expand as the library began to document twentieth century history at a global scale. The Oral History Archives at Columbia was founded by historian and journalist Allan Nevins in 1948 (as the Oral History Research Office) and is credited with launching the establishment of oral history archives internationally. The Oral History Archives at Columbia is the archival branch of the Columbia Center for Oral History, with the education and research arm, the Columbia Center for Oral History Research based in the Interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Theory & Empirics. At over 12,000 interviews, the Oral History Archives at Columbia is one of the largest oral history collections in the United States. It is unique in the nation in that it has never been confined in its scope to one region or area of historical experience. Early interviews focused on distinguished leaders in politics and government, the ‚ÄúGreat Men‚Äù of history. Over time, the biographical collection grew to include interviews with notable figures in philanthropy, business, radio, publishing, filmmaking, medicine, science, public health, law, military, architecture, and the arts. In the 1950s and 1960s, the oral history office conducted and acquired a number of large-scale projects including Radio Pioneers, 1950-1974; Chinese Republican Oral History, 1958-1976; Popular Arts, 1958-1960; Occupation of Japan, 1960-1961; Eisenhower Administration, 1962-1972; Psychoanalytic Movement, 1963-1982; and Nobel Laureates on Scientific Research, 1964. Beginning in the 1980s, the oral history office expanded its collecting approach to include histories of the New Left, civil rights, and peace movements, as well as community history. Today, the Oral History Archives at Columbia takes a more inclusive approach to collecting as a reparative correction to past biases. Recent thematic priorities include space, broadly defined, to include displacement, development, gentrification, uses of space, digital culture, the art world and archives and a continuing focus on grassroots movement including responses to gun violence, mass incarceration, anti-Islamophobia and resisting anti-trans violence. The Oral History Archives at Columbia continues to work under the umbrella of the Columbia Center for Oral History with colleagues in the research arm on large-scale projects, including the September 11, 2001 Oral History Project, the Obama Presidency Oral History Project and the NYC COVID-19 Oral History, Narrative and Memory Archive. Born in Tbilisi in 1880, Boris Alexandrovich Bakhmeteff was a civil engineer and diplomat who, after serving in a number Russian government posts during the Russian Revolution, emigrated to the United States and became a Professor of Civil Engineering at Columbia. In 1951, he helped to establish an archive dedicated to Russian history and culture at the university. The newly founded archive received financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation and from a foundation that Bakhmeteff himself had founded in 1936 called the Humanities Fund. In 1973 the archive was renamed the Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture, and the Humanities Fund transferred to Columbia, where it supported both a professorship in Russian Studies and a full-time curator for the archive. By 1986 it had grown to become the second largest depository in the world (after the Hoover Institution) of Russian √©migr√© holdings. Ranging widely in subject matter from art history and literature to organizational history and politics, the approximately 1,500 collections of the Bakhmeteff Archive allow scholars from the former socialist block to discover aspects of pre-Soviet and √©migr√© life that had not been known at all in their home countries. A printed catalog of the holdings, Russia in the Twentieth Century: The Catalog of the Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University, was published in June 1987 by G.K. Hall. As the library‚Äôs collecting scope began to encompass non-Western peoples and subjects in the 1950s, it also slowly expanded to include women and racial and ethnic minorities. Particularly notable in this regard was former Columbia University waiter, bellhop, and proprietor of popular bookstore during the Harlem Renaissance, Alexander Gumby, who sold the university his collection of more than one hundred and seventy scrapbooks with photographs, pamphlets, and ephemera, documenting an array of topics related to African American and diasporic history. And, in 1955, Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor under President Franklin Roosevelt, the first woman to serve in a cabinet position, and Columbia alumna, donated her papers to the university. The following year, the library acquired the papers of John Jay, former New York governor, U.S. Secretary of State and Foreign Affairs, and the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1789-1795). Following in quick succession were manuscript collections relating to other American founders, including Gouvernor Morris and Alexander Hamilton. A similar pattern played out when, in 1963, Chinese statesman and alumnus V.K. Wellington Koo donated his papers on politics and international affairs, and several notable Chinese military and political figures followed suit, including Li Han Hun, Shihui Xiong, and Peter Chang. In 1971, Edith Louise Altschul Lehman established the Lehman collections at Columbia, including the papers of her late husband, another former governor of New York, Herbert H. Lehman, as well as those of Governor Charles Poletti and records relating to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. To honor Governor Lehman‚Äôs legacy and highlight artifacts from these collections, Ms. Lehman also made possible the construction of the Lehman Suite in Columbia‚Äôs School of International Affairs building. The Lehman endowment provides for the ongoing maintenance of the Lehman Suite (including a 2020 renovation) and for a full-time curator dedicated to the library‚Äôs American History collections. The period between 1950 and 1970 also saw the acquisition of manuscript collections relating to major American literary figures, including Hart Crane, Stephen Crane, and Tennessee Williams, as well as contemporary writers such as Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Herman Wouk and Allen Ginsberg, the influential Beat poet. In 1970 the gift of the Random House archive inaugurated a sustained effort to collect papers from editors, publishers, and literary agents‚Äîan area which would quickly become a singular strength for Columbia with the addition of papers relating to Richard L. Simon, Lincoln Schuster, and Bennett Cerf, as well as the records of Harper & Brothers, Harper & Row, W. W. Norton, and Curtis Brown. Further amplifying the library‚Äôs literary holdings was Solton Engel, an attorney and alumnus who donated more than five hundred rare items, including Shakespeare‚Äôs third (1663) and fourth (1685) folios. The Jack Harris Samuels Library, which included three thousand rare editions of American and English literature, was bequeathed by the collector's mother, Mollie Harris Samuels, in 1970, and was formally transferred to the University in 1974. Much of this expansive growth occurred under the leadership of director Kenneth A. Lohf, who, between 1967 and 1993, saw the rare book collection increase in size by 275,000 volumes and the addition of 21 million manuscripts. It was also during his tenure that the division adopted its current name of Rare Book & Manuscript Library (1975). A highly effective fund-raiser, Lohf secured $3 million in gifts to support capital improvements and, in 1984 the new Rare Book and Manuscript Library opened in a redesigned and renovated space on the sixth floor of Butler Library, including two public reading rooms and extensive exhibition space. =1991-Present= In the 1990s and 2000s the Rare Book & Manuscript Library began to expand its collections relating to African American history and culture, placing a particular focus on Harlem. Some of the notable acquisitions include the papers of political activist Hubert H. Harrison, historian and journalist C.L.R. James, poet Amiri Baraka, Dance Theater of Harlem founder Arthur Mitchell, and former New York City Mayor David Dinkins. Since 2012 the library has also been collecting archives relating to Latino Arts and Activism with special attention to the New York City/Caribbean diaspora. Notable collections include the papers of writers Dolores Prida, Jack Ag√ºeros, and Rosario Ferr√©, and artists Jack and Irene Delano as well as the records of community organizations like United Bronx Parents. Another recent collection priority has focused on Asian American history, with the additions of the papers of William Yukon Chang, editor of the Chinese-American Times, and Yuri Kochiyama, a close ally of Malcolm X, whose life was dedicated to activism on behalf of civil rights, Asian American rights, and other social movements. The Carnegie Collections consist of four philanthropic organizations founded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The Carnegie Corporation of New York, founded in 1911, began to transfer its records to Columbia in 1990 and continues to send yearly additions. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, founded in 1910, became part of CUL in 1953, with additions in 1961-1962. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, founded in 1905, became part of CUL in 1990. The Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, founded as The Church Peace Union in 1914, came to CUL in 1974 with additions over many years. The Carnegie Corporation also provides support for a full time archivist to process and provide reference support for these collections. As early as 1959, Columbia University historian Richard B. Morris led an effort to publish a four volume set of all previously unpublished writings by John Jay. Though centered on the Rare Book & Manuscript Library‚Äôs collection, the effort also drew on relevant materials held by other repositories. 1975 and 1980 saw the release of the first two volumes, but three and four never made it to press. In 1997, with the appointment of a new editorial advisory board, the Library decided to digitize the source material gathered by the Morris team, and to commence a new print series comprising seven volumes. With support from various funding agencies, most notably the National Historical Records and Publications Commission, six of the seven volumes were published by 2020 and the final is expected in 2021. The Selected Papers of John Jay is published by the University of Virginia Press in both print and electronic form. In 2004, building upon work that began at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Columbia University Libraries established the Center for Human Rights Documentation & Research (CHRDR), a programmatic initiative to develop collections to support research, learning, and advocacy in the multi- disciplinary field of human rights. Archives related to human rights advocacy and activism form a central focus of the collecting program and the center, in partnership with the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, supports the management of and access to these collections. Major collections include the records of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, the Physicians for Human Rights, and Human Rights First, and other non-governmental organizations. The papers of individuals who have made contributions to human rights advocacy and the records of Columbia‚Äôs teaching and research programs complement the core organizational record collections. To extend our collecting to encompass digital sources of information, CUL created the Human Rights Web Archive (HRWA) in 2008. The web archive is an initiative to systematically capture and preserve human rights websites to enable ongoing access to information that may be ephemeral and at-risk of disappearing. In addition to capturing the web-based information generated by organizations whose print records the center holds, the web archive includes hundreds of other organizational and individual websites. The origins of University Archives can be traced to the Columbiana collection, a vast store of Columbia memorabilia including documents, records, artifacts, photographs, and books that was created in the late 19th century and endowed as a department in 1930. The University Archives, established in 1991 under the auspices of the Office of the Secretary, continues the work of the Columbiana Library and its curators by collecting, preserving, and providing access to records of enduring historical, legal, fiscal, and/or administrative value to Columbia University from the 18th century to the present. Areas of documentation include contributions to teaching and research, the development of schools, academic departments, institutes, and administrative units, the development of the physical plant, campus and student life, public service, and the University‚Äôs role in the history of the metropolitan, national, and international communities. Prominent University Archives collections include the Office of the President Central Files, the Office of the Provost Records, the Historical Photograph Collection, and the University Protest and Activism Collection. Although information about Architecture, Columbia‚Äôs Law School, Health Sciences campus, Earth Institute, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Nevis Laboratories, Barnard College, Teachers College, and Union Theological Seminary may be found among its holdings, the University Archives does not actively collect records from these divisions and affiliates. In July 2006 the unit was administratively transferred to the Libraries under the auspices of the Rare Book & Manuscript Library and, in the autumn of 2007, the University Archives physically relocated its operations and collections from its original home in Low Library to Butler Library‚Äôs sixth floor. A formal records management program commenced in 2015 and now the Archives functions not only as a repository for the history of the university but provides guidance on the maintenance and disposition of records for all units reporting to the Office of the Provost. In 2011, building on related materials in the history of book illustration, such as the Arthur Rackham collection, and existing cartoon collections such as the papers of Charles Saxon, drawings by Max Beerbohm, and the cartoons found in the Pulitzer Prize records, Columbia University Libraries formally initiated a new collecting area in comics and cartoons, focusing on New York-area creators and materials dealing with publishing history. The papers of long-time X-Men writer Chris Claremont served as a springboard for the papers of Elfquest creators Wendy and Richard Pini, Mad artist Al Jaffee, underground comix artist Howard Cruse, and many others, leading as well to the creation of a newly designated curatorial area in the Rare Book & Manuscript Library in 2017. The Rare Book & Manuscript Library has taken shape over nearly 270 years of Columbia University history. Its collections have grown to a half million rare books and nearly a hundred thousand linear feet of archives. They span centuries, subjects, languages, and geographies. In spite of this heterogeneity, the library aims to collect deeply in specific areas, guided by both resources and historical precedence. Teaching and outreach to Columbia‚Äôs faculty and students are priorities, even while the Rare Book & Manuscript Library‚Äôs audience is global. (Some three- quarters of the library‚Äôs visitors do not have a Columbia affiliation.) The library‚Äôs staff go about the work of collecting, describing, preserving, and providing access to the university‚Äôs special collections with perspicuity and self-awareness of its role within Columbia University, Harlem, New York City, and the larger world of academic research institutions. Units The Rare Book & Manuscript Library is currently organized into six units: *Administration *Archives Processing (oversees the arrangement and description of manuscripts and archives) *Collections Management (responsible for the intake and ongoing care of all collections regardless of format) *Curatorial (devoted to collection development, instruction, and outreach relating to core areas including Medieval & Renaissance collections, Russian & Eastern European √©migr√©s (the Bakhmeteff Archive), American History, Literature, Rare Books, oral history (Oral History Archives at Columbia), the performing arts, and comics and cartoons. *Public Services (manages the reading room, online and in-person reference and duplication requests) *The Selected Papers of John Jay *University Archives (charged with preserving and providing access to Columbia University's history) References * Jewels in Her Crown * Rare Book & Manuscript Library: Collections and Treasures * Columbia University.

Early years  Helen Marcelle Harrison Bristol was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on December 7, 1909 and educated in England and Belgium. Whilst still a child she was sent to St Mary‚Äôs School in Calne, Wiltshire, England. During her residence in Eastbourne, she went on her first flight and decided to become a pilot. She secretly took flying lessons until she received her A licence in 1935. While visiting Singapore, she qualified for her seaplane rating. She obtained her B licence at the London Aeroplane Club in April 1936 and in October qualified for her instructor‚Äôs rating. Soon afterwards, she moved to South Africa and settled in Somerset West. She acquired additional instruction at Johannesburg, South Africa before returning to England in 1935 to qualify for a commercial pilot's license. Her total commitment to aviation was made in 1936 when she became one of the first women pilots to receive an instructor's rating in England, and promptly returned to South Africa. As the first woman to hold a commercial pilot and instructor's rating in that country, she taught at the Cape Town Flying Club and demonstrated such ability that the Royal South African Air Force (RSAAF) offered her an instructor's course on military aircraft at Pretoria. Her outstanding abilities were then retained by the RSAAF to train reserve air force pilots. During this period she also qualified for the South African commercial pilot's certificate as well as instructor and instrument ratings. Until 1938 when she returned to England, her skills were employed by Central Airways at Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. In 1939 she was appointed chief flying instructor at the Sheffield Aero Club, then journeyed to the United States to earn that country's commercial pilot's certificate. Still upgrading her qualifications, she travelled to Hamilton, Ontario and earned her Canadian commercial pilot's license and class two instructor's rating. Cub Aircraft Company at Hamilton hired her as an instructor, and within a year she was named test pilot and chief flying instructor. Helen had a number of surnames. According to her divorce record in South Africa, her maiden name was Testemale. This was a divorce from Louis Botha de Waal in 1939. Various sources give her maiden name as Harrison. In April 1935, according to a legal notice published in The Times, London, she was living at 33 Heathurst Road, Sanderstead, Surrey, when she renounced the surname Barnes and stated that she was to be known as Helen Marcelle Harrison. Canada‚Äôs Aviation Hall of Fame lists her as Helen Marcelle Harrison Bristol.  Second World War  Until 1942 her experience was directed towards pilot training at Toronto, London and Kitchener, Ontario when she was accepted as the first Canadian woman ferry pilot to serve in the United Kingdom with the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). The following year she co-piloted a Mitchell bomber across the North Atlantic Ocean from Montreal, Quebec to Scotland, and until 1944 she delivered military aircraft within the United Kingdom.  Post- Second World War  As demonstration pilot for Percival Aircraft Company she flew a single-engined airplane across Canada in 1946. During the next 33 years she held chief flying instructor positions with a number of British Columbia flying services. In 1961 she earned a United States instructor's certificate and until her retirement in 1969, after 34 years as a pilot, she taught floatplane flying in Canada. In 1968 she was awarded the B.C. Aviation Council's Air Safety Trophy, after logging 14,000 hours as pilot-in-command of numerous aircraft types, without injury to passenger or crew.

Founded in 1873 in Lugano as the Banca della Svizzera Italiana, BSI was an institution that specialises in asset management and related services for private and institutional clients. In 1998, the bank became part of the Italian Generali group, one of the world's biggest insurance companies. In July 2014, Generali sold BSI to BTG Pactual for US$1.7 billion, a deal that CEO of the bank, Andr√© Esteves stated would make BTG Pactual a ‚Äúglobal player in the asset management arena.‚Äù In February 2016 EFG International (SIX:EFGN), the global private banking group based in Zurich, announced the acquisition of the Lugano-based private bank, according to an agreement signed on 21 February 2016 with BSI's sole shareholder BTG Pactual. The transaction was finalized on November 1, 2016. Following the closing, BSI's activities have been integrated into EFG, market by market, in Singapore, Hong Kong, Bahamas, Switzerland and Luxembourg. The integration of Monaco's activities is expected to take place by the end of the second quarter 2017. With the integration of the Swiss business, which took place at April 2017, the rollout of the renewed EFG brand has started in all locations where the legal integration of BSI has been completed and those businesses will operate solely under the EFG name. History In 1873 BSI opened its main office on Piazza della Riforma in Lugano. The next year, the bank opened its first branch, this in Locarno. Branches in Bellinzona (1879) and Chiasso (1906) followed.

He retained an interest in ecclesiastical matters throughout his life and was a Lay Assessor in the Dioceses of Canterbury and Southwark. He was the author of a short work on disestablishment. Politics Rees first entered Parliamentary politics at the 1918 general election when he was the Liberal candidate at Barnstaple in Devon. He declared he was a supporter of the Lloyd George coalition but so was his Unionist opponent, C S Parker The Times, 14 December 1918 He may have received the Coalition Coupon because he is described in one important and reliable record as a Coalition Liberal F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, 1969 p 327 but Roy Douglas, a historian of the Liberal Party, believes Rees was one of 29 Liberal candidates denied the coupon.Roy Douglas, The History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson 1966 p128n Another source indicates that Rees was denied the coupon but immediately accepted the Coalition Whip on getting into Parliament.Chris Cook, The Age of Alignment: Electoral Politics in Britain, 1922-1929; Macmillan 1975 p7n At the time of the election Rees stated that his political priorities were the housing question and the reform of the jury system.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p49 He won the seat with a majority of 602 votes. Rees was unable to hold his seat at Barnstaple at the 1922 general election losing narrowly by just 174 votes in a straight fight with the Conservative candidate Basil Peto. However, in 1923 when the Liberal Party was united around the question of Free Trade he won the seat back from Peto with a majority of 1,266 in a three-cornered contest including a Labour candidate. In 1924 he lost the seat back to Peto again in a straight fight by 1,195 votes. He did not contest the seat after 1924 or try to get back into the House of Commons for any other constituency. Rees tended to be on the conservative wing of the Liberal Party. Chris Cook describes Rees as a member of a right-wing coterie of Liberal MPs who could usually be found supporting the Conservatives when the party vote was split during the period of the first Labour government of 1924.Chris Cook, The Age of Alignment: Electoral Politics in Britain, 1922-1929; Macmillan 1975, pp 236n, 240 & 246n Other public service Rees served as Deputy Chairman of the Road and Rail Traffic Appeal Tribunal and was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1921 and of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey in 1954.

Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Hopewell Area School District received a $1,698,646 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2009, Hopewell Area School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district was removed from the monitoring list. =Gifted education= The Hopewell Area School District Administration reported that 96 or 3.58% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Wellness policy Hopewell Area School Board established a district wellness policy in November 2006.Hopewell Area School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, November 28, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The policy calls for annual testing to track student progress on the Health, Safety and Physical Education academic standards. This testing is not required by state or Federal law. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, public school districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required all Pennsylvania public school districts to submit a copy of the policy for approval. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, Hopewell Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. The District received $9,641 which was used to fund the Inspire Me Fitness Health and Skill-related fitness by working out on the Railyard Program.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Budget In 2009, Hopewell Area School District reported employing 209 teachers and administrators with an average salary of $59,567 and a top salary of $114,187. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. In 2011, the average teacher salary at Hopewell Area School District was $60,526 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $17,625.02 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $70,150.56. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: their state mandated and run defined benefit pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2007, the district employed 174 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $54,166 for 180 days worked. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Hopewell Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $665.13 per pupil. The District employed 13 administrators in 2010. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the Association's report, superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the local school district's teachers' union benefit plan. In 2008, the district administration reported that its per pupil spending was $11,297 per child, which ranked 367th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010, the per pupil spending had increased to $15,396.20 which ranked 92nd in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. Reserves In 2008, Hopewell Area School District reported a balance of $3,500,000 in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $2,370,764. In 2010, Hopewell Area School District Administration reported an increase to $4,800,000.00 in the unreserved-designated fund and $2,613,812. in its unreserved-undesignated fund. The district's total reserves were 7,413,812. in 2010. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. The Hopewell Area School Board approved a proposed $34.36 million budget for 2012-13 which included a property tax increase despite the District having substantial \\"rainy day\\" reserve funds. In accordance with Pennsylvania public school law, the proposed budget was available for public inspection at the district's business office in Hopewell Township. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, Hopewell Area School District received a $9,313,053 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $192,417 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, Hopewell Area School District reported that 624 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.07% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,262,572. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Midland Borough School District which got a 7.57% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some Pennsylvania public school districts at a much greater rate than other public school districts. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.88% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,408,438 to Hopewell Area School District. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Big Beaver Falls Area School District which got a 5.26%. The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $9,888,315.04. Ninety Pennsylvania school districts received a 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 562 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by LEA, 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $437,324 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten, to pay teachers to develop new curriculum and course offerings and to increase instructional time. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. The Hopewell Area School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, received $205,756. The district received $75,278 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $281,034. In Beaver County, the highest award was given to Freedom Area School District at $476,723. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Science It‚Äôs Elementary grant None of the elementary schools in Hopewell Area School District applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008-09. In Beaver County, two elementary schools participated. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem- solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It‚Äôs Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010‚Äì2011 Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 Participating districts were required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. They had to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006-07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006-07 school year. This marks an 8-percent increase over 2005-06 public school funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Governor Rendell Commends Teachers for Enhancing Science Education in Pennsylvania, August 10, 2006 The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. =Federal Stimulus grant= The Hopewell Area School District received an extra $3,171,096 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Hopewell Area School Board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count, 2007 After the review of the information, Hopewell Area School District School Board was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 67.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the respective counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2010-11 - 67.0000 mills *2009-10 - 66.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 66.0000 mills. *2007-08 - 66.0000 mills. *2006-07 - 66.0000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Hopewell Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.2%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.6%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 5.9%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.5%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.0%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 For the 2012-13 budget year, Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Hopewell Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Hopewell Area School District was $209 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 5,502 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 64% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Beaver County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to property owners in the Big Beaver Falls Area School District, who received $352. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the property owners of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 This was the third year they were the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

The Epsom Cluster, also referred to as the Horton Estate, was a cluster or group of five large psychiatric hospitals situated on land to the west of Epsom. The hospitals were built by the London County Council to alleviate pressure on London's existing lunatic asylums, which had by this time become overcrowded. The County Council continued to manage them until they were nationalised, becoming part of the National Health Service in 1948. The cluster comprised: *Horton Hospital *Long Grove Hospital *Manor Hospital *St Ebba's Hospital *West Park Hospital The Horton Light Railway transported building supplies and then coal and provisions to the hospitals in the cluster.

Naval career Drury served as commander of the ship of the line HMS Powerful during the French Revolutionary Wars, during which he was heavily engaged at the Battle of Camperdown, at which a Dutch fleet was destroyed in 1797.* In April 1804, Drury was promoted to Rear-Admiral and in 1808 was sent to be commander of the East Indies Station as senior admiral. Drury's command overlapped with that of Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope and the two engaged in numerous political struggles, even appointing separate officers to command the same ships to spite one another. In November 1810, Drury was ordered to provide Bertie with a fleet of small transport ships for the Invasion of √éle de France, which he accompanied and insisted on command despite orders not to infringe on Bertie's command of the operation. When Bertie was subsequently made a baronet as a reward for the successful conclusion of this operation Drury complained at length about Bertie to the Admiralty. Bertie demanded a court martial on his behaviour, which was dismissed by the Admiralty, who were becoming irritated by Drury and Bertie's squabbling.

This is likely due to several cooccurring factors, such as; high glycemic index, increased fat- caloric density combined with excessive sodium, cooking in trans fats, cooking with degraded oils, and the obligatory high-heat increasing exposure to acrolein, acrylamide & glycidamide. The increased relative risk is more consistently observed when focusing on shallow fry(eg; hashbrowns) and deep fry (eg.chips, especially french fries) but not routinely observed when studying unfried potato consumption. A threat from consuming fried potatoes is consuming a potential carcinogen, acrylamide which is produced when starchy foods are fried at a high temperature during the Maillard reaction. Acrylamide is formed from asparagine and reducing sugars in potatoes, so choosing potato varieties with lower levels of these compounds can reduce acrylamide formation, along with not refrigerating potatoes and only frying them until they are golden, not brown.

This equipment is found on the footplate of locomotives or in the driver's cab of power cars and driving cars in multiple unit's, hence the name. In the simplest case the position of the lever controls the extent to which the valve opens, how quickly compressed air can be released from the pipes or the reservoir in the braking system.

Magazines published by Warren include Famous Monsters of Filmland, the horror-comics magazines Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella, the war anthology, Blazing Combat and the science fiction anthology 1984 (later renamed 1994) among others. While somewhat derivative of earlier EC Comics, Warren magazines used some of the best comics illustrators and writers of the day and developed a style and feel of their own. Early life and education James Warren was born at Mount Sinai Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An art student during his grammar school and high school years, he came in second one year in the Pennsylvania State Scholastic Art Competition. He attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture and served in ROTC, leaving his junior year to enlist in the United States Army when the Korean war began. Accepted into Armored Infantry Officers Training, he was deafened six months later during training when he got too close to the .50 caliber heavy machine gun. He was medically discharged a few months later, and did not return to Penn. After Hours and Famous Monsters of Filmland In the 1950s, Warren worked in advertising as an artist and writer. Inspired by Hugh Hefner's magazine Playboy, he launched his own men's magazine, After Hours, which lasted four issues and led to his arrest on charges of obscenity and pornography in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was based. He recalled in an interview published in 1999: Through After Hours, Warren met his future collaborator, Hollywood literary agent Forrest J Ackerman, who submitted the pictorial feature \\"Girls from Science- Fiction Movies.\\" Following correspondence and telephone calls, they met in person in New York City in late 1957. There, Ackerman showed Warren a horror movie-themed issue of the French magazine Cinema 57. Recalling his youth seeing black-and-white horror movies in theaters, and realizing many of those movies were playing on television to a new generation of children, he was inspired to launch an accompanying magazine \\"carefully crafted to spoof the monsters and yet treat them as 'heroes' ... The adults wouldn't buy it, but the kids ‚Äî those millions of Baby Boomers ‚Äî would. A few weeks later I was in Forry Ackerman's living room in California, choosing the photos and article content for a one-shot magazine called Famous Monsters of Filmland, which went on sale that January with a February 1958 cover date.\\" Warren said it sold out its 200,000 print run within days. He financed the first issue, for which the upstate New York printer wanted payment upfront, through \\"some advance money from my distributor,\\" Kable News, A second issue was published eight months later \\"because I had to wait until the money came in from the first issue, and Kable wouldn't advance it to me.\\" Warren said. Warren moved to New York City in the 1960s, with his \\"Captain Company\\" (the mail-order service he concurrently founded to sell horror-related items in Famous Monsters of Filmland) remaining in Philadelphia, where overhead was cheaper. He found a duplex penthouse in midtown Manhattan where he lived on the top floor, using the ground floor living room, dining room, bath and kitchen as his \\"Warren Publishing\\" editorial office. By this time he was also publishing the magazines Wildest Westerns, Spacemen, and the satirical Help! During the first five years of those publications, his editorial assistants were future feminist icon Gloria Steinem, followed by future Monty Python's Flying Circus cartoonist Terry Gilliam. Creepy In the mid-1960s, inspired by the EC Comics of the 1950s, Warren launched the black-and-white horror-comics magazines Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella. He continued to publish a variety of magazines until the 1980s, when he left the field due to health problems. In 2008, he established a new venture, Jim Warren Publishing.

The library district also offers outreach services through its Bookmobile, Anythink in Motion, visiting area neighborhoods and community stops.  History  Originally the Adams County Public Library, Rangeview Library District became independent from Adams County in January 2005 and now operates as its own entity, overseen by a five-member Library Board of Trustees appointed by the Adams County Commissioners. ACPL was founded in 1953, and first served county residents solely out of a Bookmobile. The district has grown exponentially in the past 50+ years to its current seven branches, with four new branch buildings designed by Humphries Poli Architects (Denver) as part of its capital construction project.  Anythink  In September 2009, Rangeview Library District launched its new brand, Anythink. The district changed the names of its community libraries to Anythink libraries as part of the district's branding efforts. The district's new logo includes a \\"doodle,\\" meant to represent the beginning of all ideas, above the \\"Anythink\\" name. The tag line reads \\"A Revolution of Rangeview Libraries.\\" Library staff job titles and descriptions changed in July 2009. There are three different job titles in the branch: \\"Wrangler,\\" \\"Concierge\\" or \\"Guide.\\" Branch managers are now called \\"Experience Experts.\\" All staff and customers are referred to as \\"Anythinkers.\\" As part of the brand launch, Anythink creative consultants at Ricochet Ideas partnered with Canadian animator Jeff Chiba Stearns to create a short animation where the doodle takes on a life of its own. The animation signifies the many things a doodle can become and the sparks of imagination available to anyone who visits an Anythink library.  Sustainable Practices  The Rangeview Library District Board of Trustees decided early on that the new libraries built as part of their 2008-2010 capital construction projects would be as sustainable as possible. It was agreed that they would pursue U.S. Green Building Council‚Äôs LEED silver certification on three of the four new facilities. The district's long-term goal is to make all of its libraries carbon-neutral facilities. Anythink Bennett, which opened in May 2009, will not be certified. However, the building is highly efficient and sustainable by using local materials like beetle-killed pine for the ceiling and front entrance, Solatubes for natural light, ground-source heating and cooling and recycled materials through most of the facility. A $75,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs allowed the district to include a 10 kW photovoltaic system on the library's roof. Anythink Brighton, which opened in September 2009, is the most sustainable of the four new buildings in the capital construction project thus far and is considered the first carbon-negative library in the U.S. The facility will operate without emitting pollutants because of renewable energy and carbon credits, including a 108 kW photovoltaic system on the building's roof that was purchased through a $300,000 matching grant from DOLA. Additionally, the project will offset the emission of an additional 167,620 lbs of CO2 created by other buildings within the Brighton community by producing more renewable energy than it will use. The building is LEED gold certified.  Fine-Free Policy  As of February 14, 2009, Rangeview Library District does not charge fines for late materials. Library customers receive notification of overdue items and are billed for replacement and processing after 25 days overdue. Borrowing privileges are suspended until materials are returned or the district is compensated for lost materials.  WordThink  WordThink is a word-based classification system developed by Rangeview Library District's collection development department to replace Dewey Decimal Classification. Patterned after BISAC Subject Heading and the word-based system used by Maricopa County Library District, WordThink organizes materials according to 45 different categories with additional subcategories. Materials are then arranged alphabetically by title. The designations in the WordThink system use words instead of numbers. The spine labels include up to four levels with eight characters per line, beginning with the top-level category. The Bennett and Perl Mack branch libraries were the first in the district to adopt WordThink. By the end of 2009 all Anythink libraries used the new word- based system.  Recognition  Rangeview Library District and its Anythink libraries were the recipients of a 2010 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. The annual award, made by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) since 1994, recognizes institutions for outstanding social, educational, environmental, or economic contributions to their communities. U.S. Representative Jared Polis (CO-2) nominated the district for the award. Pam Sandlian Smith was named 2010 Colorado Librarian of the Year by the Colorado Association of Libraries for her work at Rangeview Library District. Anythink was named one of five recipients of the 2011 John Cotton Dana Award for its 2009-2010 brand launch. The award is presented by the American Library Association for outstanding public relations in libraries. In 2012, Anythink Director Pam Sandlian Smith was the recipient of the Charlie Robinson Award \\"for her transformative vision and leadership in reinventing the Rangeview Library District.\\" Administered annually by the Public Library Association, the Charlie Robinson Award honors a public library director who, over a period of seven years, has been a risk taker, an innovator and/or a change agent in a public library. In 2012, Anythink Family Services Director Lynda Freas was awarded the 2012 Sullivan Award. The American Library Association presents the Sullivan Award annual to an individual \\"who has shown exceptional understanding and support of public library service to children.\\" In 2013, Anythink Communications Director Stacie Ledden received the national \\"Mover & Shaker\\" award from Library Journal for her effective and out-of-the-box approach to library marketing and outreach, highlighted by her role in Anythink communications and the inaugural 2012 R-Squared Conference. In 2013, Anythink Director Pam Sandlian Smith was selected as a member of The Aspen Institute Dialogue on Public Libraries, a newly created initiative to explore, develop and champion news ways of thinking about U.S. public libraries. Composed of leaders from the library, business and government industries, as well as visionaries and experts from education and community development, the Dialogue gathered for an invitation-only meeting in August 2013 in Aspen, Colo. In 2014, Anythink was awarded a $32,000 grant by Adams County Open Space to help build Explore Outdoors at Anythink Commerce City, an outdoor classroom designed to help children make connections with the natural world. In 2015, Anythink Brighton received the Reaching In Award from School District 27J for innovative programming, partnerships and interactive spaces that positively impacted the students and staff of a school system that serves more than 165,000 students in Brighton, Commerce City, Thornton and Aurora, Colo. In 2015, Anythink staff member Hannah Martinez won the Lucy Schweers Award for Excellence in Paralibrarianship, issued by the Colorado Association of Libraries. Martinez was nominated for this award for her work in spearheading Anythink's AnyAbility program, designed for adults with disabilities. In 2016, Anythink director Pam Sandlian Smith was elected to serve as the 2017-2018 President of the Public Library Association (PLA). PLA is the largest association dedicated to supporting the unique and evolving needs of public library professionals. In 2017 and 2018, Anythink's magazine, SPARK, earned awards from the Colorado Society of Professional Journalists Top of the Rockies contest. The annual judged contest highlights excellence in journalism for reporters, designers and publications in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.  Funding  Rangeview Library District's current and future growth is due to the support of the Adams County community, who in November 2006 voted to approve a mill levy to help fund the library. Since then, through the leadership of library director Pam Sandlian Smith, the library system has shifted course and positioned itself so Anythink libraries are not only valuable resources but community gathering places.  2012-2014 Strategic Plan  Anythink's 2012-2014 Strategic Plan aims to guide the organization's evolution with specific goals and measures. Its six strategic initiatives are: *I. Anythink is a Learning Organization *II. Anythink is an Experience Library *III. We Understand and Collaborate with Our Community *IV. Creativity and Innovation are Supported by Technology *V. Shift Perceptions of Anythink & Libraries Anythink is one of the participating libraries in Outside the Lines, an initiative to help shift perceptions of libraries by hosting innovative campaigns or events.  Experience Zones All Anythink locations set up unique ‚Äúexperience zones‚Äù throughout the year. Experience zones are areas created by Anythink staff that allow for interactive experiences in the library. These zones use a hands-on approach to make information and learning more interactive within the library setting. Previous experience zones have included embryology programs where customers can watch baby chicks and ducklings hatch live at the library, office supply fashion design contests and the transformation a conference room into a happiness-themed retreat.  Library Usage at Anythink in 2010  * New Library Cards issued: 37,277 ** 56% increase (less Anythink Commerce City, Perl Mack and Washington Street down times in 2010) * Total Active Library Cardholders: 91,358 ** 28% of service area population is registered * Circulation of library materials: 1,715,538 ** 38% increase * Visitors to Anythink libraries: 961,555 ** 17% increase * Number of programs presented: 2,081 * Number of attendees at Summer Reading Program Events: 5,734 * Age of collection: 96% is 5 years old or less ** 48% purchased in 2010 * Materials expenditure per capita: $4.07 ** 6% decrease * Library materials borrowed through Interlibrary loan: 4,634 ** 6.25% decrease * Two new libraries opened to the public * One renovated library opened to the public * Two libraries currently under renovation/expansion  Library Usage at Anythink in 2012  In 2012, Anythink served a population of 339,492 in Adams County, Colorado, with 120,704 library cardholders. According to Anythink's Annual Report, 2,265,909 items were loaned and 106,439 books were downloaded throughout the district in 2012.  mySummer  Anythink's annual summer reading and experience program, mySummer, consists of a series of interactive programs, events and entertainment for all ages. Participants are encouraged to become mySummer members and sign up for individual programs throughout the summer months. The mySummer slogan is READ THINK DO. Anythink uses the concept of traveling kits to provide the entire district with developed mySummer programs. Previous kits have ranged in scope from paleontology to shadow puppetry to local songbirds to forensics, and partners have included organizations like the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities, and the Raptor Education Foundation. As a result of these innovative programs, mySummer participation has more than tripled ‚Äì from 3,700 in 2010 to 10,918 in 2013 ‚Äì over the course of three years. In 2012, Anythink offered 275 mySummer programs. A 2013 survey of mySummer participants found that 61.9 of participants found the programming quality to be either exceptional or exceeding expectations. In 2018, Anythink partnered with Colorado Parks and Wildlife, a collaboration that encouraged an emphasis on the state and its natural resources. The 2018 mySummer series included programs on backyard bugs, birds of prey, archery and campsite sing- a-longs. Participants were invited to continue their learning in nature, as their participation included a Colorado Parks and Wildlife gift certificate that could be applied toward entrance at any of Colorado's 41 state parks, a fishing license or campsite reservation. Because of a generous donation from Eagle Claw, Anythink also began circulating fishing poles during mySummer 2018. More than 12,900 people signed up to participate in the mySummer 2018 program.  The Studio  The Studio is Anythink's overall approach to hands- on, participatory programming. In addition to the philosophy of The Studio, Anythink also has two physical creation labs for customers ‚Äì The Studio at Anythink Wright Farms, a digital learning lab, and The Studio at Anythink Brighton, the district's first makerspace. The Studio emphasizes community partnerships and mentorships with its Artists in Residence program, which employs creative community members to share their skills with Anythink customers. The Studio at Anythink Wright Farms uses the Hanging Out, Messing Around and Geeking Out (HoMaGo) to encourage students to explore and create using digital technology.  Explore Outdoors  Anythink launched its first outdoor classroom, Explore Outdoors, at Anythink Wright Farms in September 2012. At Explore Outdoors, students are encouraged to explore their creativity through activities like climbing, building and performing. The classroom contains natural materials designed to spark curiosity and create a lifelong love of nature. It was certified as an official Nature Explore classroom in March 2013, making it part of a network of recognized schools and organizations committed to reconnecting children with nature. Anythink Grows As part of the Anythink Grows, several Anythink locations have public community gardens, including Anythink Commerce City, Anythink Perl Mack and Anythink Wright Farms. The Anythink Grows is an initiative in partnership with Denver Urban Gardens to promote healthy living. Participating community members are encouraged to harvest vegetables, herbs and fruits, while also contributing to planning meetings, workshops and community days.

Though located on a school campus that houses five difference educational facilities for students of a wide variety of ages, Anythink York Street operates as a public library for the entire Thornton community. Anythink is the lessee of the 9,388 square- foot library space on the Skyview Campus and maintains their own standard policies and procedures.  Outreach Services  In November 2008, Rangeview Library District unveiled its new bookmobile, which incorporates energy- efficient designs to reduce environmental impacts and noise. Since the launch of the brand, the bookmobile is now called Anythink in Motion. The lights and electric outlets are battery-powered by an inverter, which is charged while Anythink in Motion is driven and when plugged in at night. A Webasto heating system uses copper pipes under the floor that carry hot water, heating the bookmobile from the floor up. Sky lights provide natural light in the vessel, and Anythink in Motion gets twice as many miles per gallon as the old one. The Cummins Onan Quiet Diesel generator is used to cool the vehicle in the summertime, and its unique design reduces noise pollution and fumes. Anythink in Motion currently visits area neighborhoods and community gathering places. It also visits several Adams County schools who have limited access to Anythink libraries.  Anythink Foundation  The Anythink Foundation was created in 2009 to raise financial support for Anythink from the private sector. The Foundation is a non-profit corporation organized solely for community and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation's mission and purposes are: 1\\\\. To generate broad-based public support and participation in order to forward and support RLD's mission to \\"open doors for curious minds\\" by enhancing the public's understanding and enjoyment of the Library through the use of special programs, activities and projects. 2\\\\. To work with RLD to raise money through contributions so that capital projects, programs and activities may continue to be provided for the general public. The Foundation works with the RLD Board of Trustees and library director to identify needs for funding of special programs, activities and capital projects that cannot be funded with public- sector dollars. Funds raised by the Anythink Foundation support programs and services in four key areas: capital projects, public art, expansion of collections, exceptional programs, activities and computer education.

The ferry crosses from the community of Wymah on the New South Wales side of the river, to Granya, and is approximately east of Albury. The ferry is controlled by the New South Wales Roads & Maritime Services, but is jointly funded by both states. It operates seven days a week, and is free of tolls. From September to April, the ferry operates on demand from 06:00 to 21:00, and from 07:00 to 20:00 for the rest of the year, with several breaks during the day. If the ferry is not in operation, the alternatives are an detour downstream via the Bethanga Bridge and Albury, or a detour upstream via Jingellic. The ferry route probably dates back to the 19th century. When the Hume Dam was completed in 1936, the range of the ferry had to be increased in order to cross the raised and widened water level of Lake Hume. The previous ferry boat was constructed principally of wood, and built in 1946. The hull was long and wide, with long landing ramps at each end. The engine house was cantilevered approximately out to the side. Because of the variation in the water level in Lake Hume, the ferry operated between floating landing stages which are attached to each bank. The position of the landing stages was adjusted by hand winch to suit the level of the water. It was retired on 14 May 2013 and replaced by a new vessel.Wymah Ferry to be replaced ABC News 30 March 2012Ferry makes final trip The Border Mail 15 May 2013New Wymah ferry takes to Murray ABC News 28 May 2013 The Wymah Ferry is one of only two cable ferries to cross the section of the Murray River between New South Wales and Victoria, the other being the Speewa Ferry nearly downstream.

It is staffed by trustees and volunteers.  Introduction  The museum is located in one of the oldest parts of Alnwick and is close by Alnwick Castle. It is housed in St Mary's Church, dating from 1836, with the original organ still intact. Progress through the museum tracks the rich heritage of the region through several centuries using displays, audio-visual exhibits and hands-on activities.  Collection  Bailiffgate Museum's collection is specific to Alnwick and District with the majority of items in the collection relating to local social history. The collection includes agricultural objects, domestic items, railway items, coal mining artefacts, printing objects, photos, paintings. A rare 18th century fire pump and a display about RAF Boulmer are also on show. The Bible of William Davison (publisher) exhibited in the Bailiffgate Museum. One of the first fully annotated bibles to be issued as a part-work In 2013 the museum had two of the items on display designated as \\"Top 100 items\\" by the \\"History of the North East in 100 Objects\\" project. These were: * The Davison Bible - a bible printed by local pharmacist and progressive reformer William Davison (publisher). His desire to increase and support learning in the Christian faith led him to develop an innovative approach. Rather than solely print The Bible in its entirety, his Universal Holy Bible or Complete Library of Divine Knowledge was published in 100 parts at 1 shilling each. * The Rothbury Football. This small leather ‚Äúfootball‚Äù, stuffed with hay, is not much bigger than a large handball. It was used in contests between the villagers of Thropton and those of Rothbury; the respective goals were Thropton Bridge and the porch of the Parish Church at Rothbury. This is an example of an item that traces its sporting origins to the medieval period. The Rothbury Football was again designated one of the Top 100 Objects in 2018  Community and schools  The museum has links with the local community and offers activities for local schools and educational groups.  Exhibitions  The museum encourages local artists and holds exhibitions of their work in a separate gallery area of the museum - for details see their website. = Stella Vine= Stella Vine donated several paintings Artist Stella Vine grew up in Alnwick, has exhibited at the Bailiffgate Museum, and donated three paintings to the collection in 2004.

It fared lukewarm with audiences, and has been criticized for its lack of logic. Review of Nigah at PakiDramas Plot The story revolves around Nigah (Aaminah Haq) and Jawad (Noman Aijaz) who, falling in love soon after their first meeting, plan to get married. The discovery that their fathers (Masood Akhtar and Firdaus Jamal) are old friends appears to make things easier for the couple, but they soon begin to experience problems. As a wedding gift, Jawad receives a painting of a bride and a groom, and is shocked that the bride in the picture is Nigah. His immediate reaction is doubt, but he then becomes enraged when he begins to think that Nigah is unfaithful. Nigah tries to convince him of her innocence, but he refuses to listen. Things continue to worsen until, after throwing Nigah out of the house, Jawad attempts to start a relationship with his cousin, Shama (Irum Hasan), whom he had earlier rejected. The attempt fails as he still has feelings for Nigah. The groom in the picture is Daniyal, a wealthy and prosperous businessman. He also experiences problems related to the picture, as the picture with Nigah is published in newspapers by his enemies as soon as he gets engaged to a girl, Aashi. His character, like Nigah's, comes under the shadow of doubt, and he is shattered mentally and emotionally. Through a twist, Daniyal and Nigah meet each other, and set out to solve the mystery of the portrait. Reception In 2008, Nigah was repeat- telecasted on PTV Home.

He began his career as an employee of the British East India Company, and subsequently became an independent merchant. He is best known today for his 1772 book, Considerations on India Affairs, which detailed the exploitation and despoliation of Bengal by the East India Company which began shortly after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The observations and experiences he recorded offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal. Throughout his life, Bolts continued to propose and execute various trading ventures on his own behalf and in conjunction with various commercial and governmental partners.

He fell foul of the East India Company in 1768, possibly because diamonds were a favorite means for Company employees to secretly remit to Britain the ill-gotten gains of private trade in India, which they were officially forbidden to engage in. He announced in September of that year that he intended to start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India's first modern newspaper), saying that he had \\"in manuscript many things to communicate which most intimately concerned every individual\\", but he was directed to quit Bengal, and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England.William Bolts, Considerations on India Affairs, London, 1772, Part II, Vol.III, p.528; cited in J.

The Imperial flag did not fly for long over Delagoa Bay, as alarmed Portuguese authorities who claimed the place as their own sent a 40-gun frigate and 500 men from Goa to remove Bolts's men in April 1781, and to found the Presidio of Louren√ßo Marques (Maputo) that established a permanent Portuguese presence there.Carl Wadstr√∂m, An Essay on Colonization, vol.1, London, 1794, pp.187-195; B.

Bolts took full advantage of Austria's neutral status in the war between Britain and France, Spain and the Dutch Republic during 1778 to 1783 that formed part of the struggle for American independence. The Company's repeated acts of hostility against Bolts in India were the subject of urgent representations by the Austrian Ambassador in London, resulting in the sending in January 1782 of instructions from the Court of Directors to India, which ordered their officers in India not to give offence to \\"any subject of his Imperial Majesty\\".25 January 1782, British Library, India Office Records and Archives, Bombay Despatches, VI, f.297; quoted in Sir Richard Temple, \\"Austria's Commercial Venture in India in the Eighteenth Century\\", Indian Antiquary, vol.XLVII, April 1918, p.68. Although when he first arrived in India, at Surat, he was confronted with a wall of opposition erected by the East India Company, he soon made himself known to Hyder Ali, Nawab of Mysore and the strongest opponent of the English in India. He visited Hyder Ali at his capital, Seringapatam, where he was granted permission to establish trading factories in the Nawab's Malabar Coast dominions at Mangalore, Karwar and Baliapatam.Walter Markov, \\"La Compagnia Asiatica di Trieste\\", Studi Storici, vol.2, no.1, 1961, p.14. =Colonisation of the Nicobar Islands= While Bolts himself was at Seringapatam, he sent the Joseph und Theresia to the Nicobar Islands, where she arrived in June 1778. There her captain, Bennet, took possession on 12 July. The islands were the focus of a Christian missionary effort of the Moravian Brethren, who visited from time to time from the Danish base on the Indian mainland at Tranquebar. In consequence of Bolts' action, the Imperial company had established a trading factory on the island of Nancowery, headed by Gottfried Stahl who was accompanied by five other Europeans.Franz von Pollack-Parnau, \\"Eine √∂sterreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur √∂sterreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II\\", Vierteljahrsschrift f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte, Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.45-47.

Danish authorities strongly protested against Bolts' action in taking possession of the Nicobars, and in 1783 sent a warship to remove the Austrians.Walter Markov, \\"L'expansion autrichienne outre-mer et les int√©r√™ts portugaises 1777-81\\", Congresso Internacional de Hist√≥ria dos Descobrimentos, Actas, Volume V, II parte, Lisboa, 1961, pp.281-291. =Bolts in dispute with Proli= In spite of his many achievements since 1776, Bolts's venture, on the whole, had made a loss, to the dismay of his Belgian financial backers, Charles Proli and his associates. Proli also disagreed with Bolts over the importance of the China market: Proli wanted to concentrate exclusively on that market while Bolts urged the equal importance of India as Austrian commodities, such as mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin, and vitriol, could find sale there, in contrast to China where only Spanish silver dollars were accepted in return for Chinese products such as tea, porcelain, and silk. While Bolts was still in India, the Proli group sent out two ships, the Ville de Vienne to Mauritius and the Prince Kaunitz to China, without informing him. In ignorance of Bolts' purchase of a ship he called the Prince Kaunitz, the Proli group sent another ship of the same name to China independently of him.Guillaume Bolts, Pr√©cis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Ch√ªte de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les Ports du Littoral Autrichien, Liege, 1785, pp.17-8. This constituted a breach of their contract with him. They refused to honor the bills he drew upon their bank while he was in India. Proli petitioned the Imperial Government to have Bolts' charter transferred exclusively to him. Proli also seized the Joseph et Therese as security when the vessel returned to Leghorn.Helma Houtman-De Smedt, \\"The ambitions of the Austrian empire with reference to East India during the last quarter of the eighteenth century\\", Chaudhury Sushil (ed.), Merchants, companies and trade: Europe and Asia in the Early Modern Era, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.232-3. At an audience with Emperor Joseph II in Brussels on 28 July 1781, Bolts and Proli agreed to the transformation of their association into a share company, and in August, Bolts surrendered his charters to the new Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp for the Commerce of Asia (Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale pour le Commerce Asiatique de Trieste et d'Anvers). The Company was to send six ships to China and India, two to East Africa and Mauritius, and three for the southern whale fishery.David Macpherson, The History of the European Commerce with India, London, 1812, p.316. Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp was opened to public subscription in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, as the other thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were paid for by the nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts' valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association's debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short-term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent.Helma Houtman-De Smedt, \\"The ambitions of the Austrian empire with reference to East India during the last quarter of the eighteenth century\\", Chaudhury Sushil (ed.), Merchants, Companies and Trade: Europe and Asia in the Early Modern Era, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.232-3. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also under the terms of the agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pi√®ces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Soci√©t√© imp√©riale asiatique de Trieste, g√©r√©es √† Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, pp.60-65; N.L. Hallward, William Bolts, A Dutch Adventurer under John Company, Cambridge University Press, 1920, pp.190-95. The Imperial Asiatic Company, under the direction of the Proli group, focussed on the China tea trade. In 1781, 1782 and 1783 the price of tea in Europe, especially in England, had risen to unheard of levels. In 1781 and 1782 no Dutch or French ships appeared at Canton as a result of the American War, and in 1782 only eleven English, three Danish and two Swedish ships called there. Only four out of thirteen English ships returned safely in 1783 due to French naval activity. Attempting to seize the opportunity to make good profits, the Proli group sent five ships to Canton: the Croate, the Kollowrath, the Zinzendorff, the Archiduc Maximilien, and the Autrichien.Canton Consultations, 12 October 1783, British Library, India Office Records and Archives, G12/77; cited in Sven H.

Guillaume Bolts, Pr√©cis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Ch√ªte de la chute de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les ports du littoral autrichien, Liege, 1785, pp.29-30. However, the opportunity had been missed as, with the signing of an armistice in January 1783 the former belligerents were able to send their ships to Canton safely, and the summer of 1783 saw a total of thirty-eight ships there, including the five Imperial vessels. They had to buy tea at a high price, but when they returned to Ostend in July 1784 they had to sell at a low price on a glutted market, as well as having to pay for permission to return to that port. The price of tea at Ostend collapsed when the British Government introduced the Commutation Act in 1784, which reduced the tax on tea from fifty to ten per cent and made smuggling from the Netherlands unprofitable. The price of tea in Europe fell suddenly from 30 to 33 French sols to 11 to 14 sols, or around sixty per cent. Disastrously, a sixth ship, the Belgioioso, carrying a large amount of silver specie for the purchase of Chinese goods, foundered in a storm in the Irish Sea soon after departing Liverpool, where she was fitted out, on the voyage to Canton.The British Magazine, March 1783, p.239. Regardless of mounting losses, debts and liabilities, the Company invested in a further ship, the Kaiserliche Adler or Aigle Imp√©riale [Imperial Eagle], a giant of 1,100 tons, specially built for the Company by the Fiume shipyards, which was launched in March 1784, bringing the Company's fleet to a total of nine vessels. Matters came to a head in January 1785 when the Company suspended all payments, and shortly afterward it was declared bankrupt, bringing the Proli banking house down with it. Charles Proli committed suicide.Guillaume Bolts, Pr√©cis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Ch√ªte de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les Ports du Littoral Autrichien, Liege, 1785, pp.31-39, 65-69; Franz von Pollack-Parnau, \\"Eine √∂sterreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur √∂sterreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II\\", Vierteljahrsschrift f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte, Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.91-96.

An article in the Dublin press of 25 May 1786 recorded the sale of the dissolved company's ships, Zinderdorf [sic], Kollowrath, Kaunitz, Maximilian and Austrian, \\"together with their whole apparel, guns, stores, &c.;\\" and observed: \\"The destruction of this company, as well as several others in Europe, is in a great measure owing to the commutation tea tax in England, and the advantages which territorial possessions throw in favour of the British company.\\"Freeman's Journal, 25 May1786, reprinted in American newspapers, such as The Pennsylvania Herald (Philadelphia), 6 September 1786. Bolts's Plan for a voyage to the North West Coast of America After Bolts returned from India in May 1781, he developed the idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in sea otter furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton (Guangzhou), of the success the crew of James Cook's ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook's third expedition to the Pacific.Catherine Gaziello, L'exp√©dition de Lap√©rouse, 1785-1788, Paris, 1984, pp.49-50. Bolts' ship, the Kaunitz (not to be confused with the Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781.Gazette van Gend, 19 July 1779 and 30 July 1781. Bolts afterward wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade.Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pi√®ces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Soci√©t√© imp√©riale asiatique de Trieste, g√©r√©es √† Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, pp.104-5. At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the Cobenzell (or Cobenzl) in honor of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count Philipp Cobenzl (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts' plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at Nootka, sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including George Dixon, who subsequently commanded the Queen Charlotte on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and Heinrich Zimmermann, who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the Trieste, as a tender, and obtained letters of credence from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship would touch.Robert J. King, \\"Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the KKS Cobenzell to the North West Coast in 1782-1783\\", The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord, vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235-262. =Proposed scientific voyage of discovery= The Emperor lent a ready ear to Bolts as the venture offered a vehicle for carrying into effect his desire, prompted by the voyages of James Cook, for an Austrian round the world voyage dedicated to scientific research. This had been urged by the eminent savant Ignaz von Born who, at the Emperor's invitation, nominated five naturalists to go with Bolts on the Cobenzell.Journal f√ºr Rationelle Politik (Hamburg), July 1782.] Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pi√®ces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Soci√©t√© imp√©riale asiatique de Trieste, g√©r√©es √† Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, pp.99-100. The intended expedition was reported in the English press in mid-October 1782, in the following terms: > The Emperor intends to signalise himself, in imitation of other Princes, by > sending a ship round the world to make discoveries. The vessel destined for > this tedious and dangerous expedition, is the Count de Cobenzet [sic], which > cleared out of the Port of London the 15th of April last; sailed from > Leghorn the 26th of August, and arrived at Trieste the 1st of September with > a great cargo, part of which she is to take out with her, particularly > fourteen chests of watches and watch-work, which she brought from London. > Four persons of great learning are to be sent out in her, at the Emperor's > expence, to make discoveries in Natural Philosophy.Parker's General > Advertiser, 18 October 1782. Also in The Derby Mercury, 3 October, The Leeds > Intelligencer, 8 October and The Ipswich Journal, 12 October 1782. Although the Emperor was initially enthusiastic, he refused to provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists, and the venture eventually proved impossible to realize. Bolts' hopes for a commercial voyage and the desire of the Emperor and his naturalists for a voyage of scientific discovery were incompatible as a combined undertaking. The opposition of Bolts' Belgian former financial partners and now rivals in the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp was also a cause of its not going ahead, and in the autumn of 1782, it was abandoned. Instead of sending out a scientific expedition on an Austrian ship as Born had proposed, the Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter went from Le Havre in April 1783 on the American frigate General Washington (Captain Joshua Barney) to Philadelphia and thence to South Carolina, Florida, the Bahamas and Santo Domingo (Hispaniola). Besides plants, they were to collect animal and mineral specimens. Reflecting the origins of the enterprise, their instructions gave them the option (which was not taken up) to take ship from Acapulco in Mexico to the Philippines, thence to the Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies, the coasts of Bengal, Coromandel and Malabar, and the Iles de France and Bourbon (Mauritius and Reunion).Leopold Joseph Fitzinger, Geschichte des Kaiserlich- K√∂niglichen Hof-Naturalien-Cabinetes zu Wien, Wien, 1856, S.23-24; Helga H√ºhnel, \\"Botanische Sammelreise nach Amerika in 18.

Emperor Joseph II released Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of Catherine II of Russia.Bolts to Catherine II, Vienna, November 1782, offering to lead a Russian expedition to the North West Coast of America, Kamchatka and China, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤, —Ñ–æ–Ω–¥ –ì–æ—Å–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ [–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π A—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–π], —Ä–∞–∑—Ä—è–¥ XXIV (–°–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ –∏ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä—å—é), –¥–µ–ª–æ 61 (–ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç –ö–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ì.–ò. –ë–æ–ª—Ç—Ü–∞ –æ–± —ç–∫—Å–ø–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –∫ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–º—É –ø–æ–±–µ—Äe–∂—å—é –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∏ 1782), [Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Arkhiv Drevnikh Aktov, fond Gosarkhiva (Gosudarstvennyi Arkhiv Rossiiskoi Imperii), razryad 24: Siberian order and control of Siberia, delo 61 Project of Captain Bolts for an expedition to the north-west coast of America, 20ff.]; cited in –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä–∏–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤ –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö A–∫—Ç–æ–≤ CCCP: –ü—É—Ç–µ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å (Tsentral'nyi Gosudarstvennyi Arkhiv Drevnikh Aktov USSR: Putevoditel'), Tome I, Moskow, 1991, page 378.

The Russian Court proved unresponsive, so Bolts also put his proposal before the court of Joseph's brother-in-law, Ferdinand IV, King of Naples. He had an encouraging response from Naples, where King Ferdinand's Minister of Commerce and the Navy, General Sir John Acton, wanted to promote the kingdom's maritime trade.\\"Plan pour les lettres patentes d'octroy exclusif propos√© √† √™tre accord√© par sa majest√© le roi des Deux Siciles √† Guillaume Bolts pour le commerce et navigation aux Indes Orientales, √† la Chine et ailleurs, sous le titre de Soci√©t√© Royale Asiatique de Naples, pour le termes de 21 anne√©s\\", Archivio di Stato di Napoli, Esteri, f.4211; cited in Giovanni Iannettone, Iniziative di commercio con le Indie Orientali del Regno delle Due Sicilie, Napoli, 1967, pp. 3ff; and in idem, Presenze italiane lungo le Vie dell'Oriente nei Secoli XVIII e XIX nella Documentazione diplomatico-consolare italiana, Napoli, Edizioni scientifiche italiane, 1984, pp.66-69; and in Aurelio Lepre, \\"Sui rapporti tra Mezzogiorno ed Europa nel Risorgimento\\", Studi Storici, Anno 10, no.3, Jul.-Sep. 1969, pp.556-7. King Ferdinand gave Bolts a charter, modelled on that he had received from Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, with a term of twenty-one years from 1786, for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Societ√† dell'India di Napoli), but the Neapolitan government agreed to support Bolts only after he had made a successful initial voyage at his own expense and risk.Archivio di Stato di Napoli, Esteri, f.4211; cited in Aurelio Lepre, \\"Sui rapporti tra Mezzogiorno ed Europa nel Risorgimento\\", Studi Storici, Anno 10, no.3, Luglio-settembre. 1969, pp.557. Preparations were begun in Marseille to fit out the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag, but the venture was abandoned when Bolts received a more positive response from the French government. =Bolts and the Lap√©rouse expedition= With the Emperor's permission, Bolts also put his proposal to Joseph's other brother-in-law, Louis XVI of France. Bolts outlined his plan in letters he wrote to the Mar√©chal de Castries on 25 January and 9 April 1785. The Cobenzell would be sent around Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Nootka Sound, the Kurile Islands, and China. The sloop would be left at Nootka to trade for furs, while a couple of Frenchmen would be left in the Kuriles to learn Japanese and adopt the dress and ways of the inhabitants. At least two ships would be employed to maintain communication with Europe via both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. A botanist, metallurgist, and astronomer would be employed. In the South Atlantic, Tristan da Cunha was to be claimed for France and settled as a base for the whaling industry. In addition to Tristan, \\"the Island discovered by La Roche in 1675\\" (probably South Georgia) was to be found and settled.Bolts √† Castries, 25 Janvier 1785 and 9 Avril 1785, Rigsarkivet (Stockholm), Handel och Sj√∂fart, 193, \\"W.

The French government adopted the concept, though not its author, leading to the sending out of an expedition under the command of Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse. Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Directeur des Ports et Arsenaux, stated in the draft of the memorandum on the expedition he submitted to the King: \\"the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery ... has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise\\". However, as Fleurieu explained to the King: \\"I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts\\".\\"Projet de Fleurieu et Instructions du Roi\\", Archives nationales, Fonds de la Marine, 3JJ 386, ff.29-30; quoted in Catherine Gaziello, L'Exp√©dition de Lap√©rouse 1785-1788: R√©plique fran√ßaise aux voyages de Cook, Paris, CTHS, 1984, pp.50-51.

Although he possessed no capital himself, he was able to trade on his reputation as an expert in the Eastern trade to launch a new share company in 1783, the Triestine Society, which in September sent the Cobenzell on a commercial voyage to the Malabar Coast by way of Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo, and the Cape of Good Hope.M√ºnchner Zeitung, 21sten.

It was reported from Trieste on 22 February 1786 that \\"The Comte Cobenzel East Indiaman arrived in this port the 18th inst. with a rich cargo\\" of saltpeter, tea, cassia, camphire, coffee, pepper and other merchandise, having left Canton 23 January 1785.The Universal Daily Register, 20 March 1786. The Belgioioso under Bauer went from Canton to New York, where she arrived in June 1786.The Connecticut Courant (Hartford), 19 June 1786. The ship's arrival from New York at Dover, England, was reported in The Daily Universal Register of 15 September, and the same newspaper published an extract of a letter from Ostend dated 24 September that said: \\"The Count de Belgioioso, on account of the East India Company, is arrived here from Bengal and China, her cargo consists chiefly of piece goods, with only a few chests of the finest teas, and one of spices, from Ceylon, at which island they touched on their way home\\".The Daily Universal Register, 30 September 1786; Gazette van Gend, 25 September 1786; The Public Ledger, 10 October 1786. Share certificate of William Bolts's Triestine Society for the voyage of the Cobenzell, 20 June 1783 =The voyage of the Imperial Eagle= Having missed the opportunity provided by the American War of Independence to send a ship to the North West Coast undisturbed by British, American or French competitors, Bolts was apparently able to share in the only voyage sent there under the Imperial flag, that of the Imperial Eagle, the former English East Indiaman Loudoun, which in November 1786 sailed from Ostend under Charles William Barkley.Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, \\"A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle\\", Archives of Natural History, vol.18, part 3, 1991, pp.323-362, p.337; Log of the Loudoun/Imperial Eagle, Provincial Archives of British Columbia, A/A/20.5/L92; Beth Hill, The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley, 1769-1845, Sidney (BC), 1978, p.60; B.M.

Si√®cle, Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1155. Having cleared Ostend in November 1786, the Imperial Eagle touched at Hawaii in May 1787 and reached Nootka in June, from whence she traded southward for two months along the American coast. Barkley added significantly to knowledge of the geography of the area during this voyage, notably identifying the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He returned to Macao with his takings of furs on 5 November.The Public Advertiser, 17 June 1788; \\"New Fur Trade\\", The World, 6 and 13 October 1788, and The European Magazine, November 1788. The Imperial Eagle is described as belonging to the Austrian East India Company (that is, the Imperial Company of Trieste) in F.W. Howay, A List of Trading Vessels in Maritime Fur Trade, 178 ‚Äì1794, Ottawa, Royal Society of Canada, 1930, p.115. The expedition was apparently profitable, as an article in The London Chronicle of 21 June 1788 reported that, \\"After taking in his cargo, &c.; &c.; Captain Berkeley [Barkley] proceeded to Macao, where he disposed of his furs at an amazing price\\".Also in The Morning Chronicle, 23 June, The Public Advertiser and The Morning Post, 24 June, The Morning Herald, 25 June, and Freemans Journal (Dublin), 28 June 1788. It was originally intended that the Imperial Eagle would make three voyages to the North West Coast, Japan, and Kamchatka, but when she reached Canton after her first season she was sold under threat of retaliation from the East India Company for breaching its monopoly.Beth Hill, The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley, 1769-1845, Sidney (BC), 1978, p.60; F.W. Howay, \\"Early Navigation of the Straits of Juan de Fuca\\", The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society, vol.XII, no.1, 1911, p.9. Williamson, \\"John Henry Cox\\", p.16. Plan to colonize Australia 1786-1787 In November 1786, Bolts was given a contract by King Gustav III of Sweden to discover an island off the coast of Western Australia, where a Swedish colony and trading post could be established. However, the plan was shelved after Sweden became embroiled in war with Russia the following year. Bolts was given 250 pounds for his trouble, and the proposed colony was never established.Robert J. King, \\"Gustaf III's Australian Colony\\", The Great Circle, vol.27, no.2, 2005, pp.3-20. Bolts's final years Bolts is said to have attempted to revive his fortunes in France, setting up an enterprise near Paris, but the outbreak of war with Austria and Britain once again destroyed his hopes.Michaud freres, Biographie universelle, Paris, tome 5, 1812, entry on William Bolts.

He then moved to Lisbon where in the 1760s, before joining the English East India Company, he had worked in the diamond trade. He made his last will in Lisbon in August 1805 and died, it is said, in a Paris poorhouse (h√¥pital) in 1808.William Bolts's will made in Lisbon on 12 August 1805 and proved in London on 7 September 1808, National Archives, Kew, National Archives, Kew, PRO, PROB 11/1485, sig.710, cited by H.V.

It crossed the Milwaukee Road at Camp Douglas, instead of Tomah. In 1878 the bankrupt West Wisconsin Railway was acquired by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway.

He was also a sprinter in his youthMackay, pp98. and a referee in Lanarkshire. He is the only manager to have taken charge of Hibs in two separate spells, being the first manager of the club from 1900 to 1903 and returning in 1904 after Phil Kelso left for Arsenal. He subsequently held this position for fifteen years, also making him the club's longest serving manager to date. He was a saw- miller by trade and settled in Coatbridge in the 1880s before moving to Edinburgh sometime between 1895 and 1898. His brother-in-law, James ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù Murphy, was with Hibernian from 1893 to 1903 and seems likely to have started McMichael's connection with Hibs. He was living with Murphy and his father-in- law Thomas Murphy at 20 Ferrier Street, between Easter Road and Leith Central Station, close to the local sawmill. He helped revive the club after it was threatened with closure during the early 1890s. He was appointed secretary for season 1900‚Äì01, effectively the manager, and he led the team that won the Scottish Cup in 1902 and the Scottish league championship in 1903. He officially became the club's manager in 1904 after the club became a limited liability company, which meant that the team was no longer run by committee. thumbright Obituary of Dan McMichael. The text reads: Mr D. M‚ÄôMichael, the secretary and manager of Hibernian Football Club, died yesterday at his residence in Leith after a short illness. Death was due to heart failure following kidney trouble. Deceased was about 60 years of age, and was connected with the Hibernian Club for something like a score of years, during the greater part of which he served it in an official capacity. Mr M‚ÄôMichael had all his life taken a warm interest in football affairs and was most zealous and conscientious worker for his club, which he represented on the Committee of the Scottish League for over ten years. before he was attached officially to the club, he acted as referee chiefly in connection with Lanarkshire matches. M‚ÄôMichael - At 287 Easter Road, Leith, suddenly on 6th inst., DANIEL M‚ÄôMICHAEL, for 20 years with Hibernian F.C., dearly beloved husband of Jane Murphy. Funeral on Monday 10th, at 3P.M., to Eastern Cemetery. All friends kindly invited. Deeply mourned. R.I.P. McMichael served as Hibs manager and in other capacities until 1919, when he was one of the casualties of the Spanish flu pandemic. Like many of the pandemic victims, McMichael was buried in an unmarked grave. Several decades later, a group of Hibs supporters found the grave site from local records and raised funds for a gravestone. A dedication ceremony was carried out in December 2013, attended by 400 people.

Due to financial troubles the church couldn't be completed by 1871 and lacked its intended spire, until one was finally added 143 years later, in 2014. Nearby lies the famous Basilica of the Annunciation. History Drawing of the church showing the spire that was not built until 2014 Christ Church in Nazareth is the last work of Swiss architect Ferdinand Stadler. Works at the site began in 1869 but construction was not completed when Stadler died in 1870. When the church was finished in 1871, it was the second Anglican church to be built in the Holy Land. The first is located in Jerusalem. The building was consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat, and Rev. John Zeller was the pastor at the time of its consecration. The Church Mission Society (CMS) provided many of the early missionaries who served at Christ Church. It served as a mission center for the region and ministry also took place in Mujeidal (today's Migdal HaEmek), Reineh, and Kafr Kanna (Cana of Galilee). A number of influential priests of the Church if England were pastors and missionaries who ministered at Christ Church or were based there. These include Frederick Augustus Klein, Michael Ka'war, Seraphim Boutaji, and Khalil Jamal; the last of which was essential in founding the Protestant presence on the East Bank of the Jordan. John Zeller (or Johannes Zeller, as he was sometimes called) described worship at the church in the late 19th century with the following words: : :One part of the hall is filled with girls of the boarding school and the women of the congregation; and the other is so closely packed with men, that every observer would wish to have a larger locality. The service is in Arabic, according to the liturgy of the Church of England. The responses are said by the whole congregation, and all heartily join in the singing, accompanied by a harmonium. [...] a stranger would at once be surprised to see their heads covered, either with the red fez or a little white cap, or a black handkerchief tied with a brown rope, in the Bedouin fashion; and yet he would be struck with the close attention expressed in almost every face at the time of the sermon. : Today As of 2013 the church has about 40 families as members, and the membership is almost entirely Arab. There is one Arabic- language service every Sunday morning. Excepting visitors, attendance is usually around 50.

She set up the first tenant management association in St. Louis, Missouri, which successfully rehabilitated the once decrepit Cochran Gardens public housing project, and managed it for more than 20 years. Early life According to her own statement, Gilkey was born in bitter poverty in Arkansas. Emma Green, her mother, relocated to St. Louis in 1960DeParle, 1992, p. 3. and raised her fifteen children in a three-bedroom apartment at Cochran Gardens \\\\- the first high-rise project of Saint-Louis financed through the Housing Act of 1949, completed in 1953.Larsen, Kirkendall, p. 61. Initially intended for low-income whites, the 704-unit block was desegregated in 1956.Larsen, Kirkendall, p. 62. Emma Green and her children were among its first black tenants. Activism In 1969 Gilkey, then a 20-year-old divorced mother of two who called herself a Black PantherDeParle, 1992, p. 2. led a nine-month rent strike of some twenty- two thousand public housing tenants against mismanagement of municipal agencies and the intolerable living conditions of St. Louis highrise ghettoes‚ÄîPruitt‚ÄìIgoe, Cochran Gardens and the like.Weisman, p. 112. The city replaced its Housing Authority board, and after six more years of activism Bertha Gilkey succeeded in persuading the city of St. Louis to surrender management of Cochran Gardens, to an independent tenant management association. By this time, Pruitt‚ÄìIgoe had already been torn down and Cochran Gardens, nicknamed \\"Little Nam\\", had already been slated for demolition. Her mother, ex-husband and siblings eventually left Cochran for better places, but Gilkey preferred to stay.DeParle, 1992, p. 6. =Cochran Tenant Management Corporation= The Cochran Tenant Management Corporation became the first of its kind in St. Louis. In a short time the new management rehabilitated Cochran Gardens into a relatively safe and comfortable place. Since 1978 the complex was modernized and outfitted with new engineering systems, owing both to Gilkey's fundraising skills and to Cochran's nearly downtown location that could not be ignored by city and federal authorities. By 1992 Cochran received $33 million in federal aid, twice as much as the second-ranking St. Louis project. Gilkey personally managed the staff that reached 47 in 1991; only at this point did Gilkey hire a professional manager and accountant to run the operations. She was not ever paid a salary at Cochran (according to a 1992 source), making a living with consultancies and paid public speaking.DeParle, 1992, p. 4. Her experience fell in accord with the Republican campaign for deregulation and changing the rules of welfare administration. Gilkey, among other activists, was invited to join Ronald Reagan as he signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: Jack Kemp, Housing Secretary under George H. W. Bush, regularly cited Gilkey in an honor roll of civil rights heroes, alongside Abraham Lincoln, saying that tenant property management is \\"one of the most powerful manifestations of revolutionary ideals since 1776.\\"DeParle, 1992, p. 1. President George H. W. Bush visited Cochran Gardens in May 1991, commending tenant management and personally Betha Gilkey and attacking \\"government bureaucracy\\" and the \\"solutions of the 1960s\\". Federal supporters of tenant management did not publicize the fact that most of Cochran residents remained poor and lived on welfare throughout the decades of Gilkey's tenure. In 1990, 85% of households were headed by single women, only 27% of heads of households had jobs. Vacancy in 1990 was on par with St. Louis average of 25%.DeParle, 1992, p. 5. Gang wars with drive-by shootings resumed in Cochran in September 1991, prompting Gilkey to lead a public violence awareness campaign. In 1998, city authorities took over Cochran Gardens, citing tax mismanagement by the tenant association. The buildings, rapidly deteriorated under city management; by 1999, the vacancy rate increased from under 10% to one-third and by the end of 2008 all but one of Cochran Gardens buildings have been demolished.

She was the subject of a 1993 NBC show Fired Up! The Bertha Gilkey Story produced by John Singleton.

It was his last release in the 1960s. Bergen White was the conductor and arranger. This became Willie's first studio album in which he used his new classical acoustic guitar called Martin N-20 which he named \\"Trigger\\". Recording and composition Nelson recorded the title track on his debut album for Liberty seven years earlier. The song had also been covered by Perry Como. The album contains several Nelson originals, as well as a song written with Nelson's songwriting friend Hank Cochran, ‚ÄúAny Old Arms Won‚Äôt Do.‚Äù Perhaps the most significant musical development on My Own Peculiar Way was Nelson discovering the Martin N-20 classical guitar that would become famously known as \\"Trigger.\\" In his autobiography the singer recalls: :I switched over to a big Baldwin hooked up to an aluminum amp. When the neck broke, I traded it in for a Martin made of rosewood, an acoustic model with the richest, most soulful tone I‚Äôd ever heard. I had my man Shot Jackson, a guitar genius in Nashville, customize the Martin by integrating the guts and pickup from the Baldwin. It worked. I had the sound I was looking for. I heard it as a human sound, a sound close to my own voice. Didn‚Äôt take long for me to pick a hole in it. That‚Äôs ‚Äòcause classical guitars aren‚Äôt meant to be picked. But that hole...seemed to deepen its soulful tone. The Martin guitar changed his sound but, as Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski asserts, ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt tell by the records he was making. Vibes, trumpets, violins, a cello, saxophones, and a trombone embellished My Own Peculiar Way.‚Äù Nelson actually scored a surprise hit previously with the upbeat ‚ÄúBring Me Sunshine,‚Äù a song written by Sylvia Dee and Arthur Kent. Featuring an impressive imitation of a Vegas lounge singer, Nelson took the song to number 13 on the country singles chart, his best showing yet for RCA. However, the first single from his new album, ‚ÄúNatural to Be Gone,‚Äù bombed, not even charting, and the LP barely made the Top 40, peaking at number 39. By this time even Atkins was stumped, later confessing, \\"With a record company you can have a whole room full of people who all put their heads together and grind away at a problem and still come up with the wrong answer.\\" Reception AllMusic: ‚ÄúWhen Nelson gets into a song, he has a way of playing with the sounds and rhythm of words to get everything possible from a song.

His music belongs to the transition from the Mexican Nationalism to the Avant garde and uses all musical genres. He composed in a period of almost 60 years. Life He studied in Guatemala, Chile and Belgium. His mother was a writer from Veracruz of Lebanese descent. Mabarak practically spent his childhood outside Mexico. His father died when he was 4. During his youth, he lived in many countries because his mother worked in the diplomatic service. The family moved to Guatemala] when Carlos was 6. They lived near Quetzaltenango and almost three years in the capital. He began his piano lessons in Quetzaltenango with Jes√∫s Castillo. Later they lived for almost 5 years in Santiago de Chile where Carlos studied humanism and continued his music education. In 1932 the family moved to Belgium. While the rest of the family went to Cuba, Carlos stayed in Brussels for almost five years where he studied radio telephone engineering. In 1933, Carlos entered the Institute of high studies in music in Ixelles, a part of Brussels. There he studied piano with Mme Jacobi and harmony with Nellie Jones. In 1936 he obtained a diploma after winning a piano competition. He did his most important studies of Harmony and Musical Analysis with Marguerite Wouters who was cathedratic of the Royal Conservatoire of Belgium. Returning to Mexico in 1937 he decided to work entirely on music. His teacher in orchestra was Silvestre Revueltas in the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico. In 1942 he was appointed teacher in harmony in the Conservatory and since 1957 he taught composition. In 1945, Carlos Ch√°vez entrusted him a symphony and Mabarak wrote his Symphony in E flat. In 1956 he received a scholarship by the UNESCO. In this period he studied dodecaphonism in Paris with Ren√© Leibowitz. Mabarak also began to use magnetophonic techniques in his works. In 1968, his fanfare was elected theme for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico.

Arrangements were by Anita Kerr, Bill Walker and Ray Stevens. Background Although Nelson enjoyed a loyal and enthusiastic following in Texas, his record sales at RCA remained underwhelming. In a bid to break Nelson as a major recording star, producer Chet Atkins had employed many of the recording techniques that had worked for other stars on the label, but as the sixties neared a close it was becoming plain to Nelson that the Nashville sound simply did not suit his own musical instincts. As the singer later explained, ‚ÄúBecause Chet was convinced I could be a superstar, it was hard to walk away from his operation...Yet his way of producing, for all its technical wonders, fenced me in. I knew it, but, blinded by ambition, I accepted the formula. I should have known better, but the truth is it took me a long time ‚Äì all of the sixties, in fact ‚Äì to finally see the light.‚Äù Recording and Composition After recording an LP of cover songs, Good Times contains almost all Nelson compositions, including three written with his wife Shirley. It is very ballad heavy, with Jim Worbois of AllMusic noting, ‚ÄúThis is kind of an odd record. One side is very sparse instrumentally, while the other side has three different people providing arrangements.‚Äù Two older songs, \\"Permanently Lonely\\" and \\"Did I Ever Love You,\\" had been covered previously by Timi Yuro, the latter as a duet with Nelson. Tellingly, one of the two covers songs on the album was ‚ÄúSweet Memories,‚Äù a song composed by Mickey Newbury, a singer-songwriter who, like Nelson, would express dissatisfaction with his debut RCA album Harlequin Melodies and blaze a trail of independent recording in defiance of Nashville that would serve as a template for the Outlaw movement in the seventies. Like Nelson, Newbury wrote atmospheric, poetic songs, which were at odds with the slick hit singles that Nashville manufactured. As Streissguth asserts, ‚ÄúIn late 1967, Willie, in his bleating, wistful way, had recorded a set of starkly beautiful ballads, including the classic ‚ÄòSweet Memories,‚Äô written by Mickey Newbury, but RCA appeared flummoxed in response, slotting them in an album called Good Times next to syrupy Nashville Sound material recorded at earlier sessions.‚Äù Regarding songs on the second side of the Good Times, Nelson later lamented that his vocals were ‚Äúdrowned in a pool of overly sweet string arrangements and syrupy backgrounds by the Anita Kerr Singers.‚Äù The first single, ‚ÄúLittle Things,‚Äù climbed to number 22 on the country singles chart, while ‚ÄúGood Times‚Äù stalled at number 44, while the LP itself limped to number 29 on the country albums chart. As Nelson later recalled, ‚ÄúI was still caught up in a system ‚Äì the Nashville music assembly line ‚Äì where conformity was mandatory, and where it seemed to come with string sections and choirs of angels.‚Äù The album cover is one of Nelson's most bizarre: the singer in golf clothes on a putting green, smiling, his arms around a pretty girl in sandals and a short skirt, showing her how to putt. The cover, which contrasted sharply with the calculated sophistication of Glen Campbell‚Äôs smash albums and the danger of Johnny Cash‚Äôs At Folsom, seemed to highlight just how absurdly out of touch Nelson was with the market. Reception AllMusic: ‚ÄúThe songs are okay (maybe subpar for Nelson), with one of the most interesting being his cover of Mickey Newbury's ‚ÄòSweet Memories.‚Äô‚Äù The song \\"Buddy\\" was repopularized when it was played in the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation. It is a favorite of the character Ron Swanson, and is played during the fourth episode of season 7, \\"Leslie and Ron\\". It was played again in the series finale, the twelfth episode of season 7, \\"One Last Ride\\", during Ron's future preview.

It is IREB's role to support a single, universally accepted, international qualification scheme, aimed at Requirements Engineering for professionals, by providing the core syllabi and by setting guidelines for accreditation and examination. The accreditation process and certification are regulated by the steering committee of IREB. The steering committee of IREB is built out of the personal members of IREB. Personal members of the IREB are international experts in requirements engineering from universities, economy and education.  Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering  The IREB Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering (CPRE) is an international accepted qualification for requirements engineers and business analysts. The CPRE is a three level certification based on exams covering the freely available syllabus. Candidates who have successfully passed the examination receive the \\"Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering\\" certificate. The certificate is set up according to the ISO/IEC 17024 standard with a clear separation of the duties * IREB is responsible for the definition of syllabi and exams * Independent Training Providers provide trainings * Independent organizations provide the certification process IREB is neither offering trainings nor conducting exams itself.

There is no intention of presenting the complete theoretical framework or current and future research activities. * The Foundation Level seeks to convey fundamentals that are equally valid for any domain, e.g. for embedded systems, security systems, classic information systems, etc. In addition, the training can cover the suitability of the presented approaches for the various domains based on their special characteristics. However, it is not a goal to present specific Requirements Engineering for a given domain. * The syllabus is not based on a specific procedural model and an associated process model that stipulate the planning, control and order of carrying out the learned concepts in actual practice. No specific Requirements Engineering or even software engineering process is emphasized. * The syllabus defines necessary knowledge of a Requirements Engineer. However, it does not elaborate on the exact interfaces between this field and other software engineering disciplines and processes. Nor is any attempt made to define other roles occurring in IT projects. * The syllabus does not attempt to convey all methods and techniques that are used in Requirements Engineering. Rather, the course represents today‚Äôs most commonly used set of methods and techniques. Above all, the course intends to inspire attendees to actively gain for more experience in Requirements Engineering on their own authority The CPRE Foundation Level certificate is recognized by the British Computer Society as an equivalent to the BCS Certificate in Requirements Engineering The Syllabus for the CPRE Foundation Level is available in 12 languages: Chinese, English, French, Korean, Polish, Russian, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.

It is affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School. Founded in 1881, part of its campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Newton Cottage Hospital Historic District. It is a member of Partners HealthCare, a network founded by Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital. The hospital offers a range of medical, surgical and specialty care, including maternity services, a 24-hour emergency department and orthopedic, critical care and oncology inpatient units. History Newton-Wellesley Hospital, originally called Newton Cottage Hospital, was incorporated in 1881. The idea for the hospital began when a local reverend, George W. Shinn, encouraged the mayor of Newton, Royal M. Pulsifer, to provide health care services for sick members of the community. Nine acres were purchased for the building. The hospital opened its doors on June 5, 1886 and admitted its first patient a week later. As a cottage hospital, Newton- Wellesley was built to serve the local population. It consisted of a complex of buildings, radiating from a central administrative building. Patients were cared for in windowed ward rooms, one story high.Newton-Wellesley Hospital: A Brief History (1886‚Äì1972) Booklet, January 1970, Newton-Wellesley Public Relations Department, Newton, MA. A School of Nursing was established at the hospital in 1888. The first baby was born there in 1890 (by 1965, 50,000 babies had been delivered, including the hospital's first in-vitro baby). Newton-Wellesley acquired its first X-ray machine in 1902, and an electrocardiograph in 1933. In 1910, the outpatient department was opened at the hospital. Most outpatient departments at the time consisted of a doctor and a nurse. But Newton-Wellesley offered a variety of services, each attended by a specialist. The department had an orthopedic service, one of only two in the Boston community. A complex of eleven modestly-scaled buildings (compared to modern hospital facilities), most constructed between 1894 and 1908, were the subject of the 1990 \\"Newton Cottage Hospital\\" listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Several of the listed buildings have since been demolished. In response to the influx of patients resulting from the combination of World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic, the hospital erected a number of tents and temporary buildings. Patient records began to be kept in 1920, followed in 1924 by the establishment of an official hospital laboratory for bloodwork and urinalyses; the blood bank was first added in 1939. In 1955, the first pacemaker operation at the hospital was performed, followed by the first cardiac catheterization in 1993. The Wikstrom Surgical Center opened in 1993, providing 16 operating rooms, pre-operative and post- anesthesia areas, and a permanent MRI suite. In 1999, Newton-Wellesley Hospital joined Partners HealthCare; it affiliated with MassGeneral Hospital for Children in 2001. A number of new centers were created, including the Spine Center (founded by Andrew C. Hecht in 2001), the Waltham Urgent Care Center (2003), and Maxwell Blum Emergency Pavilion (2007) and the Vernon Cancer Center (construction began 2008). Facilities and current operations There are 273 available beds and more than 21,000 discharges every year at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. On average, there are 56,000 visits in the emergency room yearly and more than 3,700 babies born. 14,000 surgical cases are seen each year. The hospital employs approximately 2,500 people. The main campus of Newton-Wellesley is located at 2014 Washington Street, Newton, Massachusetts, near the intersection of Routes 16 & 128 (I-95), one mile south of the Mass. Pike (I-90). The closest MBTA stop is Woodland, two blocks from the hospital on the D (Riverside) Branch of the MBTA Green Line. An additional urgent care treatment facility is located offsite at the Waltham Urgent Care Center at 9 Hope Avenue in Waltham, MA. Laboratory Services also has offsite locations in Natick, Walpole, Waltham and Weston.

A friend and flight engineer named Al Schwimmer, known as the father of the Israeli air force, enlisted Winters in his efforts to supply aircraft to Jewish fighters in Israel; with his government experience, Winters managed to smuggle three B-17 bombers to Israel. Taking off from Miami, the two B-17s refueled in Puerto Rico, as if completing a normal shipping route, but instead flew to Israel by way of the Azores and Czechoslovakia; a third B-17 joined the group in Czechoslovakia. They constituted the newly created Israeli Air Force's first heavy bombers. Winters was said to have decided to help supply the Israeli forces as a favor to his Jewish friends, and received no monetary compensation for the work. His efforts gained him the nickname \\"The Godfather of the Israeli Airforce\\" The three bombers smuggled by Winters were the only heavy bombers in the Israeli Air Force during the war, but were reportedly essential in turning the tide of war in Israel's favor. In his diary on July 16, 1948, David Ben-Gurion noted their arrival in Israel, and mentioned that they had already been used for several bombing runs in Egypt. They formed 69 Squadron of the Israeli Air Force, known as the \\"Hammers\\". Winters was subsequently prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in Miami for violating the Neutrality Act of 1939 in conspiring to smuggle three bombers via Czechoslovakia to Palestine. Winters was found guilty, fined $5000, spent 18 months in prison, and was finally released on November 17, 1949. Schwimmer, though convicted, was not sentenced to prison, and was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2000.https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clinton-pardons Another man in the operation, Herman Greenspun, was also convicted with no prison time, and pardoned in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. Later life At the time of his death, Winters was married to the former Joan Babineau and had two children with her, Lisa and James (Jimi). His sons Charles Todd and Charles Jr. were from previous marriages. He never told his children about his smuggling or prison time, and his son Jimi recounted that the first hint he ever had of something in his father's past was when his father admitted to him that he couldn't buy a gun. In 1961 he received a letter from then Foreign Affairs Minister Golda Meir, commending him for his efforts and inviting him to the opening of a new memorial in Israel. Winters lived the rest of his life in Miami, where he founded an export firm. He died there October 30, 1984Bush pardons 19, commutes 1 prison term. Dec. 23, 2008.

Pardon Winters' son James, along with his close childhood friend Frank Jimenez, began campaigning for his father's pardon after his death, receiving the support of, among others, 21 Congressmen, the American Jewish Committee, and Steven Spielberg. President Bush officially pardoned Winters on December 23, 2008. Democratic Representative Ron Klein, who led the congressional group, commented that \\"President Bush made the right decision today to issue a posthumous pardon to Charles Winters, a Florida resident who played an essential role in the creation of the state of Israel.\\" Winters' lawyer, Wilmer Hale partner Reginald Brown, stated, \\"He did a heroic thing and, at the time, the law didn't reflect our values. The pardon is a way of the law catching up with the history.\\" His son James responded to the pardon, saying, \\"This is a present for my father...It was a monumental challenge, but my dad used to always say 'Keep the faith,' and we did\\".

It was an early concept album that aimed to pay tribute to the State of Texas. The original album artwork features the Alamo, along with three San Antonio construction projects completed in 1968: the Tower of the Americas, HemisFair Arena and the HemisFair monorail system. Background By 1968 Nelson had recorded a string of albums for RCA but none had sold in vast quantities. Although he remained very popular in his home state of Texas, and was highly regarded in Nashville for composing hits like ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHello Walls,‚Äù his success as a songwriter did not translate as a commercial recording artist. Nelson felt hamstrung by Nashville's recording practices, feeling the soul of his songs were being buried under background vocalists and strings. According to Nelson, who continued touring with his own band during this time, it was RCA head and producer Chet Atkins who came up with the idea of recording an album dedicated to Texas: ‚ÄúBack in Nashville, Chet Atkins was still racking his brain, trying to find ways to get my records to sell. He came up with a concept, Texas in My Soul, that had me singing songs about my home state. Not a bad idea...But when I tried to use my road band in the studio, Chet said no.‚Äù Recording & Composition Unsurprisingly, the album pays tribute to Texas honky-tonk legend Ernest Tubb with three of his compositions, including the standard ‚ÄúWaltz Across Texas‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Little Bit of Everything in Texas‚Äù and the title track. \\"Texas in My Soul\\" was written in the late 1940s by Ernest Tubb and Zeb Turner, along with an uncredited Justin Tubb, Ernest's eleven-year-old son. While singles were cut and released by Tex Williams and Hank Penny, Ernest never recorded the song. Nelson, who cited Tubb as a primary influence, had also appeared on Tubb's syndicated show dozens of times throughout the sixties. \\"Dallas\\" was co-written by Dallas- based music promoter Dewey Groom, who owned and operated the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, where Nelson regularly played. It was the first song since \\"Big D\\" to make that city sound appealing, with references to Love Field airport, the North Central Expressway, and some of the prettiest women in the world, at a time when the city was still regarded negatively as the city where President Kennedy had been assassinated. \\"The Hill Country Theme\\" was written by Cindy Walker for Texas Hill Country-born Lyndon B. Johnson, who was President of the United States at the time. The song was adopted as Johnson's official theme song. Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops recorded a symphonic version of the song which was included on one of their RCA Victor albums. While the sound was still a ways off from the one Nelson would cultivate as part of the Outlaw movement in the seventies, the concept played to his strengths, as AllMusic's Mark Deming observes: \\"While a few of the songs here are real clunkers (the opening track, 'Dallas,' is especially dire), Nelson seems to be having fun with 'Who Put All My Ex's in Texas' and 'Texas in My Soul,' while delivering 'Waltz Across Texas' with commendable feeling, and though the musicians here aren't as simpatico as the core of players Nelson would tour and record with through the '70s and '80s, these sessions seem to suit Nelson's musical personality better than most of his recordings for RCA Victor.\\" According to his book Willie Nelson, biographer Joe Nick Patoski cites the Texas in My Soul sessions as when Atkins finally put his foot down regarding members of Nelson's band playing on his records: :Greg Martin picked his nylon strings in a way that rubbed off on Willie, with Chet Atkins's electric and Jimmy Day's glistening steel chiming in. Funnyman songwriter-performer Ray Stevens, who had already worked several Willie sessions, added vibes and organ. Johnny Bush drummed. Chet informed Willie after the sessions that he didn't want Johnny Bush or Jimmy Day back in the studio. They may have been Willie's guys but they were road pickers, not studio musicians or Chet's guys, and Chet was producer, CEO, and had the last word. \\"San Antonio\\" which was composed by San Antonio steel guitar player Jerry Blanton, who performed with George Chambers and the Country Gentlemen, became Nelson's sixth RCA Victor single, peaking at #50. Chambers and his band had recently backed up Nelson for four weeks in Las Vegas. Reception AllMusic: \\"Not a great album, Texas in My Soul at least devotes itself to something Willie is passionate about, and is good throwaway fun four decades later.\\" Track listing #\\"Dallas\\" (Dewey Groom, Don Stovall) ‚Äì 2:16 #\\"San Antonio\\" (Jerry Blanton) ‚Äì 2:32 #\\"Streets of Laredo\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 3:33 #\\"Who Put All My Ex's in Texas\\" (Eddie Rabbitt, Tony Moon, Larry Lee)-2:16 #\\"The Hill Country Theme\\" (Cindy Walker) ‚Äì 2:20 #\\"Waltz Across Texas\\" (Ernest Tubb) ‚Äì 2:28 #\\"William Barrett Travis Letter\\" (Merle Travis) ‚Äì 2:05 #\\"Remember the Alamo\\" (Jane Bowers) ‚Äì 2:57 #\\"Texas in My Soul\\" (Zeb Turner, Ernest Tubb) ‚Äì 2:02 #\\"There's a Little Bit of Everything in Texas\\" (Ernest Tubb) ‚Äì 2:21 #\\"Beautiful Texas\\" (W.

In 1924, he spent the season with the St. Paul Saints, and had a 15-4 record and 3.45 ERA in 39 games; he was noted as the league's best pitcher that season thanks in part to his high win percentage.

Background By 1967, Nelson had enjoyed immense success as a songwriter, penning ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù for Patsy Cline and ‚ÄúPretty Paper‚Äù for Roy Orbison, but had enjoyed only middling success as a recording artist himself. His most recent album, Make Way for Willie Nelson, had produced the Top 20 single ‚ÄúOne In a Row,‚Äù but his sales paled in comparison to other country stars like Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash. As he later put it, ‚ÄúFor all my songwriting success, my RCA albums languished on the shelves. I was far from what you‚Äôd call a superstar. I wasn‚Äôt playing concert halls or arenas. I was playing beer joints.‚Äù Nelson was becoming increasingly unhappy with RCA, feeling the label did not promote his records enough and kept him around so his stable mates could pillage his poor-selling albums for material. In Nelson's first autobiography Atkins admitted, \\"I was just about the worst at promotion and sales. I didn't care anything about that part of the business. What time I wasn't in the studio, I was off somewhere playing my guitar...It hurt Willie a lot to have a guy with my attitude about sales as the one who was suppose to push his product.\\" Nelson‚Äôs inability to create his live sound on record would remain a source of frustration for him in the years ahead. Recording and Composition Chet Atkins, who delegated responsibilities to Felton Jarvis for Nelson‚Äôs previous LP, returned as producer for The Party‚Äôs Over and Other Great Willie Nelson Songs. Nelson managed to have two members from his band, steel guitarist Jimmy Day and drummer Johnny Bush, participate in the recording sessions, although Atkins said no to the using Nelson's full band in the studio. Unlike his last two albums, which were dominated by cover songs, The Party‚Äôs Over boasted only original compositions. The title track had been written years earlier when Nelson had been living in Houston and was part of a two week songwriting spurt that saw him also write ‚ÄúFunny How Time Slips Away,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrazy,‚Äù ‚ÄúMr. Record Man,‚Äù and I Gotta Get Drunk.‚Äù It would reach number 24 on the singles chart. A second single, ‚ÄúBlackjack Country Chain,‚Äù which had been written for Nelson by Red Lane, was climbing the country singles chart at number 21 when radio stations started banning the record for its grisly content. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Stay Around‚Äù was co-written with Hank Cochran, who helped get Nelson a job writing for Pamper Music when the Texan first arrived in Nashville in 1960. Reception Jim Worbois of AllMusic enthuses, ‚ÄúThe title track sums up this album perfectly. This is one of those records that sounds incredible at 2 o'clock in the morning when one is feeling reflective after a busy night.‚Äù Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski deems it ‚Äúnot Willie‚Äôs most stellar work.‚Äù Track listing All tracks composed by Willie Nelson, except where noted. #\\"Suffer in Silence\\" #\\"Hold Me Tighter\\" #\\"Go Away\\" #\\"Ghost\\" #\\"To Make a Long Story Short (She's Gone)\\" (Fred Foster, Nelson) #\\"A Moment Isn't Very Long\\" #\\"The Party's Over\\" #\\"There Goes a Man\\" #\\"Once Alone\\" #\\"No Tomorrow in Sight\\" #\\"I'll Stay Around\\" (Hank Cochran, Nelson) #\\"End of Understanding\\" Personnel *Willie Nelson ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Jim Malloy ‚Äì engineer ReferencesBibliography  * Category:1969 albums Category:Willie Nelson albums Category:Albums produced by Chet Atkins Category:RCA Records albums Category:Gospel albums by American artists ","title":"The Party's Over and Other Great Willie Nelson Songs"},{"id":"20821787","text":"Emperor Xuan is the name of: * Emperor Xuan of Han (91 BC ‚Äì 10 January 48 BC), Chinese emperor of the Han Dynasty. * Emperor Xuan of Jin (179 ‚Äì 7 September 251), posthumous title bestowed upon the Cao Wei statesman, general, and regent Sima Yi. * Emperor Xuan of Western Liang (519‚Äì562), Chinese emperor of the Liang Dynasty. * Emperor Xuan of Chen (530‚Äì582), Chinese emperor of the Chen Dynasty. * Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou (559‚Äì580), second last emperor of Northern Zhou.

The attack left 24 dead and more than 300 injured. The attack was carried out at 5.22 PM after Sheikh Hasina the leader of opposition finished addressing a crowd of 20,000 people from the back of a truck. The attacks targeted Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. Hasina was injured in the attack. Events and casualties Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina had been speaking at a public meeting on Bangabandhu Avenue, protesting blasts against the party's workers in Sylhet. The rally drew a crowd of 20,000 people. As Hasina finished her speech, a total of 13 grenades were thrown into the crowd from the rooftops of nearby buildings, killing at least 16 people on spot, later the death toll reached 24. The blast left more than 500 injured. Among the dead were Hasina's bodyguard, Mahbubur Rahman and Awami League Women's Affairs Secretary Ivy Rahman, who died from her injuries three days later. = Reaction = The Awami League called for a nationwide hartal on 23 and 24 August 2004 following the incident. Khaleda Zia, then Prime Minister of Bangladesh condemned the attacks, and also vowed a thorough probe to catch the culprits. An intercity train was burned down by Awami League activists on strike in Bhairab. Awami Leagues activists also organized protests in Chittagong and furled black flags at the sight of the attack. A funeral service for the victims at Baitul Mokarram National Mosque was attended by 20 thousand people. Protests in Dhaka were attacked by members of Bangladesh Police and Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, the workers wing of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal activists also attacked and injured six members of the press. President of the United States, George W. Bush, expressed \\"shock\\" at the attack and conveyed his message to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and Opposition leader Sheikh Hasina through the Secretary of State of the United States, Colin Powell. The attack was also condemned by the United Kingdom, Royal Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. InvestigationInitial investigation= Bangladesh Police refused to register any criminal case filed by Bangladesh Awami League over the attack and only registered a general diary. The government initially refused to hand over the bodies of the victims. Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Interpol made repeated visits to Bangladesh to provide technical support. The Government also tried to implicate Mokhlesur Rahman, an Awami League activists, and Shaibal Saha Partha. They were arrested by Bangladesh Police. Shaibal Saha Partha and Joj Miah were tortured in custody and forced to give a false confessional statement. An investigation by the Supreme Court Bar Association accused the government of destroying evidence. The government was also criticised for hurriedly burying two unidentified dead bodies from the terror attack in the middle of the night. In 2004, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party- led alliance government assigned Crime Investigation Department of Police to foresee the investigation. They came up with a story that some Joj Miah, also known as Jamal Ahmed from Noakhali district, along with 14 other criminals of Seven Star terrorist group of Subrata Bain attacked the Awami League rally. They met at Moghbazar before the attack, and rehearsed at a remote island before the attack. The government of Bangladesh formed a one-man judicial probe led by Justice Joynul Abedin. The Awami League rejected the commission which blamed the attack on a neighboring country. The Daily Star described Abedin as a \\"shame\\" for the judiciary in Bangladesh. On 26 June 2005 Joj Mia, a petty criminal, confessed his involvement in the crime under section 164, to the magistrate. The story collapsed following investigative journalism who discovered holes in the official story. =Fresh investigation= In 2007, after the military-backed government assumed office, many of the BNP and Awami League leaders were rounded up by the government agencies, and fresh investigation into the case was launched. After almost one year, in November 2007, Mufti Hannan, a militant leader from Gopalganj who was arrested by the BNP-led government in 2005, revealed that the attack was operated by the militant outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami of which he was a leader. He also admitted that he got support from Maulana Tazuddin, brother of BNP leader and former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu while coordinating the attack. According to his statement, Abdus Salam Pintu had knowledge of the attack. In 2008, after the detailed investigation, the then CID high official Mohammad Javed Patwary concluded that the attack was aimed at killing Sheikh Hasirnna and was guided by the common grievance of both Mufti Hannan and Abdus Salam Pintu against Sheikh Hasina for her role in \\"subduing\\" Islam. The investigation report mentioned that, Abdus Salam Pintu was personally responsible for the attack. =Further investigation= In 2009, Awami League came to office and decided to launch a further investigation into the incident and appointed a retired CID official Abdul Kahar Akhand as the person in charge. In the same year, Abdul Majed Bhat alias Yusuf Bhat gave a confessional statement with the details regarding the source of grenade used in the attack. He claimed that Muzaffar Ahmad Shah of Tehrik-e-Jihad Islami (TEJI) gave the grenades to Maulana Tajuddin to send those to Indian militant groups. Tajuddin, instead of sending those to India, kept those with him. According to Yusuf Bhat, these grenades were later handed over to Mufti Hannan to carry out the attack. After two years, in 2011, Mufti Hannan gave another confessional statement implicating many big names, mostly BNP leaders and some former officials of the government including the son of opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, Tarique Rahman, former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, former member of parliament Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad and some officials of the Home Ministry, police, Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), National Security Intelligence (NSI) and Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with involvement in the planning of the bombing. In the statement, Mufti Hannan claimed that the attack was aimed at destroying the top leadership of Awami League including Sheikh Hasina, and BNP leader Tarique Rahman along with Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and the then Home Minister Lutfuzzaman Babor assured them with government support. Perpetrators Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI) leader Mufti Abdul Hannan was arrested on 30 September 2005 for the grenade attacks, and was later charged in connection with it. He reportedly confessed to the attacks in November 2007. He was sentenced to death in December 2008 for attempting to kill Anwar Choudhury in 2004. In March 2012, the son of opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, Tarique Rahman, and 28 others were tried in absentia for their alleged involvement in the attack. The supplementary charge sheets charges Huji, influential leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat, including former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, former member of parliament Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad and some officials of the Home Ministry, police, DGFI, NSI and PMO with involvement in the planning of the bombing. Jamal Ahmed, also known as Joj Mia was coerced into giving a false confession. He was forced to implicate Seven-Star Group, led by Subrata Bain through torture by security forces during BNP rule. Charges and punishments On 10 October 2018, a special court, Speedy Trial Tribunal-1, delivered verdicts in relevant cases and accused 49 persons in total. It ruled the grenade attack \\"was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power\\". Judge Shahed Nuruddin said, \\"The specialised deadly Arges grenades that are used in wars were blasted at the Awami League's central office on 23 Bangabandhu Avenue in broad daylight with the help of the then state machinery\\". On charges of killing through common intention, planning and criminal conspiracy, 38 persons were found guilty. 19 of them were sentenced to death: On the same charges, 19 others were given life term in prison sentences: All of the 38 were also found guilty of grievously injuring victims through common intention, planning and criminal conspiracy and sentenced to jail for 20 years. On the charge for harbouring the offenders, former Inspectors General of Police Ashraful Huda and Shahudul Haque were sentenced to two years in jail. For the charges of harbouring and protecting the offenders, Saiful Islam Duke, Saiful Islam Joarder, ATM Amin were given four years in jail. For the charge of misleading the investigation and cooking up the \\"Joj Mia\\" story, IGP Khoda Baksh Chowdhury, SP of CID Ruhul Amin, ASPs of CID Abdur Rashid and Munshi Atikur Rahman were sentenced to two years in prison. Total 18 convicts were on the run at the time of the verdict.

Based in Leatherhead, Surrey, UK, the centre operates Surrey County's only wildlife hospital (one of the three largest such hospitals in the UK) and maintains a referral service for wildlife hospitals throughout Europe. The organisation also carries out environmental activist and educational roles. Wildlife Aid has attracted media attention for its rescues of photogenic wild animals like young foxes and baby badgers; Animal Planet's TV program Wildlife SOS chronicles the activities of Wildlife Aid volunteers as they rescue imperiled animals. Wildlife hospital Wildlife Aid got its start in 1979 when its founder, Simon Cowell, MBE acquired a farmhouse in Leatherhead with the intention of starting a local wildlife rescue facility. Formally established a year later, the centre's activities steadily increased in scale; the hospital now treats more than 20,000 wild animals a year, returning 70% of them to the wild. It has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of animals since the charity's formation in 1980. The organisation currently operates on a budget of ¬£350,000 per year and relies on over 300 volunteers to provide an all-year-round service. Its facilities include two operating theatres, a pathology lab, and an intensive care unit. The charity's longer term aim is to build a larger complex on a new site that will allow the expansion of the organisation's educational programmes; the planned expansion would increase the facility's footprint to , rely heavily on eco-friendly technology, and be carbon-neutral.

The pump is notable for its long, and sometimes dark history, as well as its cultural significance as a symbolic start point of the East End of London. The term \\"East of Aldgate Pump\\" is used as a synonym for the East End or for East London as a whole. Design The wolf's head on Aldgate Pump Aldgate Pump is a Grade II listed structure. The metal wolf head on the pump's spout is supposed to signify the last wolf shot in the City of London. Historic photographs show that the pump was formerly surmounted by an ornate lantern. The pump can no longer be used to draw water, but a drainage grating is still in place. History As a well, it was mentioned during the reign of King John in the early 1200s.Aldermary Churchyard ‚Äì Aldgate Ward, A Dictionary of London (1918). accessed 14 September 2009 A structure is shown on Braun and Hogenburg's map of 1574, and shown as St Michael‚Äôs Well on the Agas map of 1633. John Stow recalled the execution of the Bailiff of Romford on a gibbet ‚Äònear the well within Aldgate‚Äô.The London Encyclopaedia, Weinreb and Hibbert This execution seems to have been carried out on the dubious basis that he was involved in Kett's Rebellion of 1549.Romford Recorder article looking at the execution https://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/heritage/romford-history-shock-as- bailiff-was-hanged-under-martial-law-1-5116417 The pump in 1874 Served by one of London's many underground streams, the water was praised for being \\"bright, sparkling, and cool, and of an agreeable taste\\". These qualities were later found to be derived from decaying organic matter from adjoining graveyards, and the leaching of calcium from the bones of the dead in many new cemeteries in north London through which the stream ran from Hampstead. Several hundred people died during what became known as the Aldgate Pump Epidemic, and on its relocation in 1876, the New River Company changed the supplies to mains water. Fenchurch Street railway station was built in 1841 upon the site of Aldgate Pump Court.Aldgate Ward School ‚Äì All Hallows Garschirch, Gracechurch, Grascherch, in Gracioustreete, A Dictionary of London (1918). accessed 14 September 2009 As the City of London developed, it is thought to have been taken down and moved a short distance to the west, to its current location in 1876, as a result of road widening. East End The pump has been at its current site since 1876 The line of the former eastern walls and gates of the City are taken as the usual start point of the East End, but the pump lies just inside site of the former Aldgate. The pump is a suitable symbolic start point for several reasons: * The removal of the gate and associated walls in the late 18th century gave the pump added significance. * The social importance of pumps as meeting places * The pump marks the start of the A11 road towards Norwich and distances to locations in the Tower Division of Middlesex, Essex and East Anglia were measured from here. Cultural referencesPhrases= East of Aldgate Pump is a term used to apply to the East End or East London as a whole. It is also used in two phrases which seem to hark back to the epidemic: * As Cockney Rhyming Slang; Aldgate Pump, or just Aldgate for short, rhymes with ‚Äúget (or take) the hump‚Äù, i.e. to be annoyed. * A draft on Aldgate Pump refers to a harmful, worthless or fraudulent financial transaction, such as a bouncing cheque.

Autism National Committee operates as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  History and activities  Autism National Committee was founded in 1990 to protect and advance the human rights and civil rights of all persons with autism, Pervasive Development Disorder, and related differences of communication and behavior. It was founded by the late Dr. Herb Lovett. In the face of social policies of devaluation, which are expressed in the practices of segregation, medicalization, and aversive conditioning, AutCom asserts that all individuals are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, AutCom works to ensure that people with autism and related disabilities are treated equality and with dignity. In 2012, AutCom published How Safe is the Schoolhouse? An Analysis of State Seclusion and Restraint Policies written by Jessica Butler. The report provides a summary of state restraint and seclusion laws and policies in effect in 2012 for students in school. Approximately 29 states have meaningful legal protections against seclusion and restraint in school.Butler, Jessica. \\"Unsafe in the Schoolhouse: Abuse of Children with Disabilities\\". The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc. May 27, 2009.  Public policy  Autism National Committee believes strongly that no person should be subject to restraint, seclusion, aversives, or other forms of abuse. Children in school should receive positive supports and accommodations for their disability needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that hundreds of children have been subjected to these techniques, including a 7-year-old dying after being held face down for hours by staff, and 5-year- olds tied to chairs with duct tape and suffering broken arms and bloody noses. According to \\"Unsafe in the Schoolhouse: Abuse of Children with Disabilities\\", a large number of students who are abused have autism. Autism National Committee has issued a statement supporting the use of facilitated communication, a pseudoscientific technique which involves holding a non- verbal person's hand to a keyboard with the aim of helping them type messages. It has been proven that the facilitator, rather than the disabled person is the source of messages produced through facilitated communication. CNN reported on the experiences of some users of facilitated communication at Autism National Committee's 2007 conference.

Aberrant crypt foci form before colorectal polyps and are one of the earliest changes seen in the colon that may lead to cancer. ACF are, as opposed to normal epithelial cells, apoptosis resistant. When looking for aberrant crypt foci with microscopy, methylene blue is used as a staining agent. The resulting figure is fairly easy to detect under the microscope at low magnification (x40). Chemically induced ACF in rodents have been used extensively to test chemicals and diets that might prevent colorectal cancer, and reported in more than 400 scientific articles. The \\"chemoprevention database\\" shows the results of all published scientific studies of chemopreventive agents, in people and in animals. The relevance of ACF as a surrogate endpoint biomarker for cancer is controversial. Recently, several alternative precancerous lesions have been described (namely MDF, BCAC, and flat ACF), which might be better biomarkers than ACF.

He was named head football coach at the University of Richmond on December 14, 2016 after spending eight years as head coach of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The Spiders compete in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision as members of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). Playing career A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Huesman played prep football at perennial power Moeller High School, where he lettered for four years under head coach Gerry Faust. He helped Moeller's team compile a record of 43‚Äì0‚Äì1 and win a pair of Ohio state championships. An all- city selection in football as a senior, Huesman signed a football scholarship with Chattanooga, where he started all four years as a defensive back (1978‚Äì1981) and was a two-sport athlete. He played under the late Joe Morrison for two years and competed his final two seasons under Bill Oliver. Huesman also patrolled center field on the baseball field for the Mocs during his freshman and junior seasons. During his playing career at Chattanooga, the Mocs posted a 31‚Äì11‚Äì2 mark and were Southern Conference co-champions in his freshman and sophomore seasons. Coaching career Huesman began his coaching career as a student coach for University of Tennessee at Chattanooga during the 1982 season. He followed that up with a move to the University of South Carolina as a graduate assistant under Morrison. =William & Mary= Huesman than began a 14-year stretch at the College of William & Mary and was the Tribe's defensive coordinator for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. During his tenure with the Tribe, Huesman coached current NFL star Darren Sharper, who led a defense ranked second in the nation, allowing just 231.8 yards per game in 1996. That defensive squad also led the Yankee Conference in total defense and helped power the Tribe to their first conference title since 1970. In 1997, the Tribe defense was third overall in the Atlantic 10 and led the league in pass efficiency defense. In addition to coordinating the Tribe's defense, Huesman, also coached the William & Mary secondary, a job he took over in 1991. In eight seasons under his direction, the College of William & Mary developed one of the most effective backfields in the nation. During his time at William & Mary, Huesman also coached Steve Christie, a 15-year NFL place kicker with Tampa Bay, Buffalo, San Diego and the New York Giants. His coaching family tree also includes Alan Williams, the defensive backs coach for the Indianapolis Colts, and Sean McDermott, the secondary coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Both Williams and McDermott played for Huesman at William & Mary. =Memphis= Huesman then spent six years at the University of Memphis (1998‚Äì2003) where he held several positions, serving as the recruiting coordinator and offensive line coach, before leaving for Richmond. He also coached the outside linebackers, tight ends and running backs. As recruiting coordinator, Huesman brought in a top-50 recruiting class, ranked No. 1 in Conference USA, in 2002. It was the first recruiting class ranked in the top-50 at Memphis in school history. =Assistant at Richmond= Huesman then moved on and spent the next five seasons as the defensive coordinator at the University of Richmond, helping guide the Spiders to the 2008 Football Championship Subdivision National Title. The Spiders were known for their \\"Stonewall Defense,\\" a phrase that was coined by Bruce Dowd of the College Sporting News. Richmond's defense was ranked in the top-15 in the nation in each of the last three seasons under Huesman's guidance. In 2006, Huesman led an experienced group that allowed just 268.7 yards per game to rank 11th in the nation and second in the conference. Against the pass, the Spiders were the Atlantic-10's most dominant team, yielding an average of 152.8 yards and intercepting a league-best 12 passes. Richmond's front seven ranked fourth in the conference and 21st in the nation against the run, limiting the opposition to just over 115 yards per game on the ground. The Richmond defense allowed the fourth-fewest points in the conference and 22nd fewest in the country (18.1). In 2007, the Spiders ranked second in the CAA and 15th nationally in sacks per game (2.6), while ranking third in the league and 31st in the NCAA in turnover margin per game (+0.6) in 2007. In 2008, Richmond's defense ranked in the top-10 in the FCS and was No. 1 in the Colonial Athletic Association in total defense (268.8 yards/game) and scoring defense (15.6 ppg). The Spiders also held 12 different opponents to fewer than 100 yards rushing and less than 20 points. Richmond's 29 interceptions in 2008 beat the school's previous single-season record of 20 set back in 1973. Huesman's \\"Stonewall Defense\\" was most impressive in the 2008 national title game played in Chattanooga. His Spiders held the No. 4 Montana Grizzlies scoreless for three quarters, and just seven points total, in a 24‚Äì7 win. =Chattanooga= Huesman was named the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga football program's 22nd head coach on December 22, 2008. Huesman led Chattanooga to its first SoCon title since 1984 and just its fifth in school history in 2013. He directed the Mocs to an overall record of 8-4, with a 6-2 mark in league play. UTC finished its season as the top defensive squad in the SoCon, leading the conference in scoring defense (20.4) and total defense (328.9). The Mocs had a number of firsts in 2013, including the most wins ever in SoCon play. The eight wins are the most since 1980 and Chattanooga swept the league's Coach of the Year (Russ Huesman), Offensive Player of the Year (Jacob Huesman) and Defensive Player of the Year (Davis Tull) honors for the first time. The Mocs were nationally ranked for several weeks in 2013, finishing the year in the top 25 in both the FCS Coaches Poll (23) and The Sports Network Poll (21). It was the first time since 1984 that Chattanooga was listed in a year-ending national poll. Huesman also became just the second UTC head coach be named SoCon Coach of the Year by his peers (Buddy Nix, 1990). Huesman took the honor for the second time, joining Joe Morrison as the only Mocs coaches to win multiple SoCon Coach of the Year honors. He was also a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award as the National Coach of the Year. The 2014 season saw the Huesman led Mocs build upon the previous season's success. Under Huesman's guidance, Chattanooga claimed an outright Socon Championship, top 8 seed into the FCS Playoffs and gained their first win in the FCS Playoffs in school history. Since taking over in 2009, Chattanooga is 41-29 under Huesman. It is important to note that his 31 wins in the first. 5 years eclipse the number of wins the Mocs had in the previous nine seasons combined. He has a 30-17 Southern Conference record since taking over the fledgling program. =Head coach at Richmond= After eight years at Chattanooga, Huesman was named head coach at the University of Richmond on December 14, 2016, returning to the school where he had previously spent five years as defensive coordinator.

Their lineup consists of Rob Danson (vocals and guitar), Rob Hume (bass and background vocals), and Robert Smith (drums). Death to Anders are active in the influential Echo Park and Silver Lake music scenes in Los Angeles and were founding members of the Central Second Collective, a group of up-and-coming rock musicians dedicated to promoting innovative, new music in Los Angeles. Often compared to Pavement, early Modest Mouse and Sonic Youth but defying hard classification, Death to Anders shift dramatically between hypnotic melodies and raging dissonance as they mix intelligent, story-driven rock with quirky Gothic Americana.  Formation and history: 2004-present  Death to Anders was first formed as a duo in 2004, under the name of the \\"Thick Liquid Sucker Punch\\", by Danson and original guitarist Nick Ceglio while the two were students at the Musician's Institute in Hollywood, California. While most of their classmates were interested in heavy metal or progressive rock, the two bonded over their shared enthusiasm for Sonic Youth, the Pixies, and Pavement. Death to Anders joined with several other young Los Angeles bands, including the Happy Hollows, the Transmissions, One Trick Pony, the Henry Clay People, Anchors for Architects, and DiE RoCKERS DiE, to form the Central Second Collective, a group dedicated to promoting innovative, independent music. The collective's name refers to the Cocaine, an indie club within 2nd Street Jazz, a venue located at Central and 2nd Avenues in the \\"Little Tokyo\\" district of downtown Los Angeles. Although the Central Second Collective no longer formally exists, member bands continue to play and record together, appearing regularly in the independent and underground clubs of the Silverlake and Echo Park music scenes, the birthplace of successful indie bands like Beck, Elliott Smith, Rilo Kiley, Sea Wolf, and Silversun Pickups. Several of the Second Central Collective bands, including Death to Anders, will also be featured in the book Gooseberries, a collection of portraits by Los Angeles music photojournalist Sterling Andrews that will be released through Eenie Meenie Records in the Spring of 2009. Death to Anders self-produced their first album \\"Punctuate the Calamities\\" in the Fall of 2006, and after recording with British producer David Newton (formerly of the Mighty Lemon Drops) at Rollercoaster Recording in 2007, they released two albums in 2008, a full-length entitled \\"Fictitious Business\\" and an EP entitled \\"Enigmatic Market\\". In 2010, Danson re-formed Death to Anders as a dynamic 3-piece featuring bassist Rob Hume and drummer Robert Smith. In 2011, armed with new material, the trio released the E.P. \\"Don't Give Up,\\" which was recorded at Infrasonic Sound (No Age, Wavves, Fools Gold) and mixed by Ali Nikou at BlasterMaster Productions in Los Angeles. Death to Anders released their E.P. on October 25, 2011 during L.A blog Buzz Bands' three-year anniversary show at The Echo in Echo Park, California, where they shared the bill with Everest and Hands.  Musical style and influences  Danson, DiBiasio, and Ceglio (left to right) live at Tokyo Garden in Fresno, California on December 4, 2008 The dissonant tones, dynamic melodies and complex song structures that shape the Death to Anders sound reveal a broad array of influences and reflect the diversity of its members. Hailing from different areas of the United States‚ÄîBoulder, Colorado (Danson); Eindhoven, The Netherlands (Hume); and Detroit, Michigan (Smith) -- the band integrate genres as varied as punk rock, indie rock, and alternative country. While their work has been compared to Pavement, early Modest Mouse, the Pixies, and Sonic Youth, it is also described as difficult to classify, \\"radical\\", and \\"fresh\\". Rob Hume's highly melodic bass work, inspired by Bruce Thomas of the Attractions, is effortlessly integrated with Smith's energetic, Keith Moon (The Who) and Jimmy Chamberlin (Smashing Pumpkins) inspired drums. Danson's lead vocals, which range from the quietly sincere to squealing intensity betray the influence of Stephen Malkmus, Nick Cave and Isaac Brock, Death to Anders are also known for their intelligent, darkly humorous and often mysterious lyrics, which are written by Danson and Ceglio and inspired by the literary works of Henry Miller, Albert Camus, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Tom Robbins, and Chuck Palahniuk. The title of the band's debut album, \\"Punctuate the Calamities\\", is even a reference to Miller's Tropic of Cancer.

Additionally, NCPC works to identify \\"over the horizon\\" proliferation concerns and creates strategies to ensure that the IC is well- positioned to address them. History In 2004, then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist proposed a National Counterproliferation Center, noting that, \\"The greatest threat facing our country today is not solely a terrorist, but a terrorist armed with a weapon of mass destruction.\\" He noted that a Center was needed \\"to focus, clarify and coordinate\\" U.S. efforts to stop the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear arms and missiles. Frist continued: \\"The bottom line is this: Just as we must take the offensive in the global war on terrorism, we must similarly take the offensive in stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We need a good offense, and counterproliferation is just the answer. At its founding, then-Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte noted that, \\"NCPC will enhance our country's ability to prevent terrorists or terrorist-related entities from acquiring\\" WMD. Current initiatives ;NCPC Funding of Counterproliferation Technologies Shortly after its 2005 founding, NCPC established a fund to foster the development of innovative, counterproliferation technologies. It has been estimated that the fund \\"is in the low tens of millions.\\" According to a former Office of the Director of National Intelligence budget official, \\"[The fund will] be seed money\\" that NCPC can focus toward worthwhile, cutting edge counterproliferation projects across the Intelligence Community. ;Counterproliferation Reserve Corps In a 2008 speech by Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Donald Kerr, \\"Our National Counterproliferation Center is trying to lead the way in developing a plan to have a Counterproliferation Reserve Corps. It's really an adjunct to the Intelligence Reserve Corps that we already have, but we're really trying to bring these people back in a way that we can get another ten years or so out of their accumulated knowledge. It's going to be very important not just in the proliferation area. I think there are a number of others where we're going to have that same issue.\\" ;Advisory Committee on Bioterrorism In 2006, it was announced that NCPC had formed a committee of medical experts to collaborate with the Intelligence Community on biological threats. According to NCPC Director Kenneth C. Brill, \\"While such a pandemic would be largely dealt with by those U.S. government agencies concerned with domestic and international public health issues, the Intelligence Community would be looked to for actionable medical intelligence about the spread of pandemic diseases that would not be available publicly.\\" NCPC received praise for this effort in the Report of the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism, which noted that, \\"NCPC also reaches out to elements inside and outside the U.S. government to identify new methods or technologies that can enhance the intelligence community's capability to detect and defeat future proliferation threats.\\" Leadership ;Director * Ambassador Kenneth C.

It is a subject of public interest primarily because it was the residence of Adolf Hitler, the later dictator of Nazi Germany, from 1910 to 1913.  The dormitory in the 1900s  Back view from Pasettistra√üe Side view from Stromstra√üe The construction of the dormitory in 1905 was financed by a private charitable foundation which aimed at reducing the number of Bettgeher (\\"bed-goers\\") in Vienna. Bettgeher were poor people with no fixed abode, often shift workers from the countryside, who paid a small fee for the use of a bed in a private house for a few hours during the day. In 1910, they numbered 80,000 in Vienna, and were regarded as a threat to the morals of the host family. The six-story dormitory was among the most modern facilities of its kind when it was opened in 1905. It was lit by gas lamps and light bulbs, and heated by a modern steam heater. On the ground floor, it featured a mess hall, a reading room with daily newspapers and a library. The underground floor held cleaning rooms, a luggage room, a bicycle storage room as well as a shoemaker's and a tailor's workshop. Moreover, the dormitory included a sick room with a resident physician, a disinfection chamber for the de-lousing of new residents, washrooms, a shaving room and a bathroom with sixteen showers and four bathtubs. The actual dormitory was located on the upper four stories. Each of the up to 544 residents had a small cabin to his own, measuring by . The cabins, which were unlocked each evening at 8 p.m. and had to be vacated by 9 a.m., had a lockable door, a lightbulb, a bed, a small table, a clothes- hanger and a mirror. The weekly rent was 2.50 crowns, about as much as a Bettgeher would have to pay for the use of a bed, which made it a very affordable lodging for unskilled labourers or journeyman artisans with an annual income of about 1,000 crowns. When the dormitory opened, the Viennese press praised it as \\"fantastical quarters, a paradise on earth\\" and as a \\"wonder of elegance and inexpensiveness\\".  Adolf Hitler's stay  Side view from Winarskystra√üe According to police registration files, Adolf Hitler ‚Äì at the time unemployed and living off the sale of his paintings ‚Äì lived in the dormitory for three years, 9 February 1910 to 24 May 1913.Hamann: Hitlers Wien, p. 227 and 568. He had moved in from a homeless shelter in Meidling, where he had stayed since December 1909, and moved to Munich in 1913 after receiving his father's inheritance. Hitler himself appears to have provided no details about his daily life in Vienna, but several of his co-residents later published their recollections of Hitler's stay in the dormitory. They report that he read the newspapers each morning in the non-smoking area of the reading room, where he also painted, discussed politics with other residents and gave speeches.Hamann, p. 237. Among the men who wrote about Hitler's residence in the dormitory were Reinhold Hanisch, a vagabond and part-time labourer who died in prison in 1937 under unclear circumstances and whose recollections were published in The New Republic in 1939; one Karl Honisch who wrote a report for the Nazi party archives in 1938; Josef Greiner, a worker who published slim memoirs in 1938 and 1947; and an anonymous man who wrote reports that appeared in Czech newspapers in the 1930s. Other co-residents of the dormitory with whom Hitler was involved included his Jewish friends Eduard L√∂ffner and Josef Neumann, the Viennese druggist Rudolf H√§usler who moved to Munich with Hitler in 1913, and a rival painter, Karl Leidenroth.  Later history  Construction sign of the retirement home project In the 1990s, the Viennese city government decided to close the timeworn dormitory, which now served as a shelter for the homeless, in favour of a new shelter in Floridsdorf. Prior to its closure on 28 November 2003, the dormitory served in 2002 and 2003 as the venue of regular productions of George Tabori's play Mein Kampf, whose subject is Hitler's stay in Vienna. After its closure, the building was briefly occupied by squatters. In 2007, the former dormitory was converted to a retirement home with 200 rooms, named Seniorenschl√∂ssl Brigittenau. It opened in January 2009; its entrance is on Winarskystra√üe.

The wide variety of products made using these techniques range from everyday use objects, such as trays, chests, folding screens, to famous decorative lacquered boxes known as ‚Äúcajitas de Olinal√°‚Äù.

It is part of this state's Costa Chica region and while near the Pacific Ocean, most of the territory is mountainous. The population is dominated by the indigenous Amuzgo ethnicity, whose women are noted for their traditional hand woven garments, especially the huipil, which is made both for home use and for sale outside the area. Toponymy The name Xochistlahuaca comes from the nahuatl xochitl (flower) and ixtlahuatlan (plain); \\"plain of the flowers\\". The town Parish church The center of population and of the Amuzgos in Guerrero is the town of Xochistlahuaca with a population of 4,152. It is located in rugged territory at an elevation of 390 meters above sea level. The town is home to a communal Amuzgo radio station called Radio √ëomndaa (Word of water, referring to the Amuzgo language). It has become notable for its advocacy on Amuzgo issues locally and nationally. The Museo Comunitario Amuzgo has two halls. One contains pre-Hispanic pieces, other historical items such as those from the Mexican Revolution and other antiques. The other is dedicated to the Amuzgo handcrafts, especially textiles, and photographs related to the Amuzgo people. Demographics Amuzgo women in town The population is young with just over fifty percent under the age of twenty. In 2005, 91.7% of the population was indigenous with almost 86% of these being Amuzgo. The rest are almost all Mixtec . Xochistlahuaca is the largest of the Amuzgo communities which are located in this mountain area on both sides of the Guerrero/Oaxaca border although eighty percent are in Guerrero. Most of the Amuzgos in the municipality still speak the language, which is of the Oto-Manguean family. Some are monolingual, not speaking Spanish. The origin of the Amuzgo people is not known but as their language is related to Mixtec, it is possible they migrated along with these people from the north and separated out to this region to escape inter-ethnic violence. The Amuzgo name for Xochistlahuaca is Sulja√°. There are some mestizos, which live primarily in the seat. Culture Amuzgo man in traditional dress in front of the Amuzgo Community Museum Ireneo Santa Ana Guerrero explaining images of textile weaving at the Amuzgo Community Museum Most of the municipality's cultural heritage is based on that of the Amuzgos, as the largest community of this ethnicity. Children from the municipality have been gathering indigenous oral stories for recording as part of the Concurso National de Narraciones Orales en Lenguas Ind√≠genas (National Contest for Oral Narrations in Indigenous Languages). Juana Iriabth Moctezuma Tapia won the contest in 2004. Most of the population is classified as Catholic although there is a small but growing percentage of Protestants. Protestantism was introduced to the region by the Instituto Ling√ºistico de Verano in the 1940s. Catholic beliefs are generally a syncretism with Amuzgo ones. On the feast day of Saint Mark, which comes at the beginning of the rainy season, chickens are sacrificed over a set of blue rocks which represent thunder and lightning. This is in petition for abundant rain and crops for the coming growing season. The end of the growing season and harvest are marked by the feast day of the Archangel Michael on September 29. Traditional medicine men and healing are still preferred by many as illness is generally conceived of as spiritual. Other important festivals include Carnival and the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on December 12. In the community of Cozoyoapan, the feast day of Saint Sebastian on January 20 is important. Most women and even men wear traditional clothing, made with either commercial or hand woven fabric. Industrial weaving has made hand weaving obsolete except for specialty garments or for those made for sale. the Amugo women of Xochistlahuaca are known for their hand woven fabric using the most traditional techniques and designs. Most of this fabric is sewn into huipils, a traditional women's garment and other traditional items such as tablecloths, napkins and rebozos. All pieces are original with no two exactly alike. Amuzgo women begin learning the weaving process when they are children with simple tasks such as cleaning and carding cotton. As they grow, they learn more difficult techniques and designs from the mothers and grandmothers using a traditional backstrap loom. Historically, weaving was to make clothing from the family, but it has become an important source of income for many Amuzgo families. A number of Xochistlahuaca weavers have won awards for their work such as the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 2004 and the weavers receive support from federal and other sources. Cooperation with government and university institutions has allowed the weavers to create new items and designs including pants, bathrobes, skirts and more. However, the huipil remains the most common and most sought-after item even though they tend to sell better to foreign buyers than Mexican ones as foreigners tend to appreciate the effort that goes into traditional weaving. The traditional diet of the municipality is based on corn and other locally grown products. Chocolate is generally consumed as a beverage, especially during special events such as weddings. Tamales are a fundamental part of the diet and come in a variety of forms and fillings such as sweet corn, pork, chicken, freshwater shrimp and more. One local dish is called the cabeza de viejo or old man's head and there is a type of sweetened tortilla called a ticaso. History There is evidence that Xochislahuaca was the capital of an Amuzgo dominion, which was subject in part to the Mixtec province of Ayacastla when the Aztecs arrived in the 15th century. While Ayacastla was subjugated, the Amuzgos were never completely or directly under the control of the Aztecs. However, because of Aztec domination of the area, the name Xochistlahuaca comes from Nahuatl and means \\"plain of flowers.\\" This is also the case for \\"Amuzgo\\" which means \\"where there are books,\\" probably referring to the Xochistlahuaca's role as an administrative center. Much of the Amuzgo concentration in this region is due to the displacement of these people from the coast, first by Mixtec expansion, then by Spanish domination. Lastly, escaped slaves and their descendants came to dominate former Amuzgo lands, especially in what is now Cuajinicuilapa. The community of Cozoyoapan was founded by displaced Amuzgos in the colonial period from what is now San Nicol√°s in Cuajinicuilapa. The area was conquered by Pedro de Alvarado in 1522. After the Spanish conquest, many indigenous in Guerrero died of disease and war, leaving the Amuzgos as one of only four ethnic groups to survive. In 1522, Xochistlahuaca had a population of about 20,000 but in 1582, this was down to 200 Amuzgos before recovering later in the colonial period. The Amuzgos were integrated into colonial rule via evangelization. In 1563, the town was named an administrative and religious center, similar to its role in the pre Hispanic era. During the 16th century, it was subject to Oaxaca city (then called Antequera) then it became part of the Puebla province. In the 17th century, it became part of the Chilapa diocese under Puebla and in 1884, it lost its status as a religious center. During the Mexican War of Independence, Vicente Guerrero and his troops passed through the area in 1812, stopping at the Cerro Verde to reorganize and supply. In 1821, it became part of the Capitan√≠a General del Sur, but then went back to Puebla in 1823 as part of the municipality of Ometepec. When the state of Guerrero was created in 1849, the town was made the seat of a municipality, which was then ratified in 1872. However, the seat was moved to Abasolo in 1873. In 1932, the town became a seat of a municipality again, this time separating from Ometepec. This was recertified in 1934. From the colonial period through the 19th century, the Amuzgos lost control of their lands, paying rent to Spanish lords such as Guillermo Hacho. In 1920, the Amuzgos began to fight to regain control with the Xochistlahuaca ejido established in 1933 on 6,384 hectares. This ejido was recognized as the Xochistlahuaca municipality in 1934. In 1967, the ejido/municipality received 1,419 hectares more territory for a total of 7,803 hectares today. In 1997, Hurricane Pauline, one of the worst cyclones to hit Mexico's Pacific coast, caused heavy rain leaving the municipally stranded by the loss of roads. Since the latter 20th century, the political situation in Xochistlahuaca has been unstable. It is complicated by the fact that there are two authorities, traditional indigenous councils, mostly Amuzgo and the constitutional municipal government, dominated by mestizos. The Amuzgo council usually consists of elders selected for their participation in the community, especially the sponsorship of religious festivals as well as family ties. The municipal authorities are dominated by mestizos because of their command of Spanish and greater ties to the overall Mexican culture. This has caused tension between the two groups which has been complicated by converts to Protestantism who reject the traditional councils and independent political movements, especially since the 1980s. In the early 2000s, the political situation was particularly volatile with the municipal president Aceadeth Rocha refusing to recognize certain traditional authorities. In 2001, a group of Amuzgos took over the municipal palace to protest. This action spurred the creation of the Frente C√≠vico Ind√≠gena de Xochistlahuaca and the Frente Comunitario de Xochistlahuca, which have had influence in both political and social issues. Sentiments among the Amuzgos have run particularly against the PRI political party, which dominated municipal politics for decades and mostly in favor now towards National Action Party (PAN). Since 2006, both traditional and municipal authorities have recognition but the situation remains uneasy. On March 20, 2012, a 7.4 earthquake was centered very near the municipality affecting it and most of the rest of the Costa Chica region. It was the strongest in Mexico since the 1985 earthquake. Over fifteen communities in the municipality suffered moderate damage including large cracks and separated walls in a number of community churches and landslides covering roads. Geography and environment Ravine outside the town of Xochistlahuaca The town and municipality is located southeast of the Guerrero capital of Chilpancingo. It is part of the Costa Chica region of the state which extends from Acapulco to the Oaxaca border. The municipality straddles the Sierra Madre del Sur and the flatter areas that reach down towards the Pacific Ocean. About 65% of the terrain of the municipality is mountainous and rugged, mostly in the north with small mountain ranges known as Pajaritos and Malinaltepec, which reach about 2,000 meters above sea level. The two most important elevations are the Cerro Verde and the Cerro de Agua. About 25% is flat and semi-flat with the rest being small valleys and riverbanks. The main river is the Santa Catarina which separates the municipality from the state of Oaxaca. Other important rivers include the Puente and the San Pedro or Xochistlahuaca River. These rivers with year-round flow provide potable water for most of the area's population in towns such as Tres Arroyos, La Monta√±a, El P√°jaro, El Chacale, La Guacamaya, El Lagarto and Arroyo Caballo. Other rivers include Atotonilco Verde, Mujer, Totole, Fierro, P√°jaro and Lagarto. There are also many streams which flow year round as well. The climate is semi moist with temperature ranges between hot, semi hot and temperate depending on altitude. Tlacoachistlahuca border are the coolest. The average annual temperature is 25C. Average annual rainfall is between 1000 and 2000 mm per year with a defined rainy (May to October) and dry (November to April) season which are agriculturally and culturally important. Most of the territory is used for either agriculture or livestock. There are some areas with forest. There are two main types of wild vegetation in the municipality. The first runs along the north side of the Sierra Made del Sur where there are mixed forests with various species of trees including oak and mahogany. On the south side, there is low-growth rainforest (under fifteen meters of height) with much of the area's fruit growing takes place. Many of the trees lose their at least some of their leaves during the dry season. Much of the area's habitat has been degraded but there is still some wildlife such as raccoons, badgers, foxes, wild boar, deer, wildcats, and a number of reptile and bird species. Socioeconomics View of houses from the bell tower of the parish church The municipality, including its seat, has a very high level of socioeconomic marginalization. It is the fourth poorest in the state of Guerrero and the sixteenth poorest in Mexico. In 2010, there were 6,019 residences in the municipality. Most of these are constructed with adobe and thatch instead of more modern cinderblock and brick, especially outside the municipal seat. Most are one or two rooms, and some are simple structures meant to be occupied during the growing season. Most homes in the municipality lack one or more services such as running water, electricity and drainage. Almost 30% with dirt floors. Almost 33% earn less than minimum daily wage. Migration out of the municipality is low but it is growing. Most are men who go to Acapulco, Chilpancingo, other states in Mexico and some to the United States. This migration is both seasonal and permanent. Women who migrate usually stay in Mexico and work as domestics. There is an illiteracy rate of almost 30%. About 54% do not complete basic education. One improvement is that access to health services rose from less than fifteen percent in 2005 to over 73% in 2010. The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, livestock, handcrafts especially textiles and ceramics and some commerce. Newer products include the making of cheese and piloncillo. Most of the products which are sold outside of the municipality go to the mestizo markets in Ometepec. These include cash crops such as oranges, mamey, sugar cane, jicama and piloncillo, along with handcrafted items such as textiles and fireworks. Economic activity is generally assigned by gender with men doing the farming and livestock raising and women doing domestic chores and weaving. The main economic activity in Xochistlahuaca is agriculture. Agriculture is mostly of the slash-and-burn variety with most land held communally. The most important crops are corn, beans, sesame seed and hibiscus followed by squash, chili peppers, tomatoes, cotton and cacao . Important cash crops include mangos, sapotes, tamarind, hibiscus, amaranth, spearmint, tomatoes and potatoes. Most is grown on the south side of the municipality. There has been a growing industry of cattle raising and dairy products, such as cheese for sale to surrounding municipalities, especially Ometepec. The forest as a number of tropical hardwood species which are used to make furniture with an annual harvest of about 2500m2 per year. About 45% of the population is dedicated to industry, mostly women who weave. Weaving and other handcrafts play an important economic role as in many cases, farming is not enough to meet subsistence needs. Most of the commerce is in the municipal seat and includes shops selling sewing supplies, groceries, farming supplies and food stands. There is some tourism by people who come to see the textiles.

The institute was notable for seeking to build a Utopian community of alternative-lifestyle conservatives in Southern Utah. The community collapsed in 1994 due to financial problems incident to the loss of property in an accidental explosion.  Founding  William H. Doughty, the institute's founder and money manager, accepted over $1 million in donations and loans from backers in an attempt to build a conservative Utopia in Duck Creek and Mammoth Valley, Utah (near Hatch). In December 1986, Doughty purchased a vacant lodge in Duck Creek from Harry and Gabrielle Moyer, who carried the note for him. He later moved his Institute for Constitutional Education (ICE) from Cedar City to the lodge. Contributors include W. Cleon Skousen, Glenn Kimber, and Donald N. Sills. Collapse During the winter of 1993, snow build-up from a record snowfall led to a propane explosion at the Meadeau View lodge. The investment which had been made in this asset was lost, as well as the income from seminars and conferences. As a result, donations and other fundraising efforts also failed, leading to the demise of the organization. On January 25, 1994, the Utah Division of Real Estate issued a cease-and-desist order to Doughty, ordering him to stop marketing the Mammoth land and timeshares at Liberty Village, because the offerings weren't registered with the division. At least 72 families and individuals were promised land at Mammoth with \\"donations\\" ranging from $2,000 to $14,000. The fledgeling George Wythe College, which had been holding classes in the lodge, moved to Cedar City, and those who sought to build the community, including Shanon Brooks (who later became president of George Wythe University), left. As of 2004, Doughty still maintained a ranch in Mammoth Valley.  Aftermath  The Deseret News reported that participants who lost money were reluctant to come forward to authorities, due to their inherent distrust for the government.

In the third game of the season, against California, Barnes gained notoriety for the delivery of a hard hit against running back Jahvid Best, an early Heisman Trophy prospect. Late in the second quarter, Cal quarterback Kevin Riley recognized Maryland was in man-to-man coverage. Since he saw there were no safeties in the middle of the field, he threw a short screen pass to Best. Barnes, who had anticipated the play from the snap, immediately delivered a bone-jarring tackle that almost knocked off Best's helmet. While still lying on the field, Best rolled onto his side to vomit. Footage of the hit and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video phenomenon that received 50,000 views on YouTube within a week.Eric Prisbell, Terps' Barnes Has Become a Big Hit On the Internet, The Washington Post, September 17, 2008.

The installation of testing magnets on both sides of the vehicle in 1971 considerably improved its utility, making it possible to test station entry and exit signals in one pass. Number 724 001 was retired on 18 January 1986 at Bw Heidelberg. Since then the vehicle was left by itself for many years and eventually stood in a very dilapidated state in front of Worms locomotive shed. In 2007 the railbus was bought up by the Vulkaneifelbahn and taken away to Gerolstein, where the intention is to restore it in the medium- term. No. 724 001 is the last existing Uerdingen railbus prototype, the former Class VT 95. * Vehicle number: 724 001-3 ex 6205 Wt; VT 95 906 * Class: 724 * Manufacturer: Uerdingen 1950 / 56752 * Conversion: 1968 AW Kassel * Length over buffers: 10,650 mm * Empty weight: 15 t * Top speed: 90 km/h * Power: 110 kW  724 002 and 724 003  Because more and more lines were equipped with Indusi, one vehicle no longer proved sufficient.

It officially opened in November 2011 and is mainly used for basketball, ice hockey, and music concerts. It is home to the Evansville Purple Aces basketball teams and the Evansville Thunderbolts minor league hockey team in the Southern Professional Hockey League. Events The first public event held at the Ford Center was an Evansville IceMen hockey game on November 5, 2011, when the IceMen defeated the Fort Wayne Komets 3-1. The first concert was held four days later on November 9, 2011 by Bob Seger and his Silver Bullet Band. The Evansville Purple Aces played their first basketball game on November 12, 2011, beating the Butler Bulldogs 80-77 in overtime. In its first year, the new arena also hosted concerts for Elton John, Lady Antebellum, Reba, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Steel Panther with Judas Priest, and Cirque du Soleil's performance of Quidam. The Ford Center played host to a game in the 2012 College Basketball Invitational, in which the Aces lost to the Princeton Tigers 95-86. The Ford Center also played host to the 2013 GLVC basketball championships and the 2014 and 2015 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship. In September 2014, the Ford Center hosted Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) Division 1 International playoffs, hosted by local roller derby league, Demolition City Roller Derby, featuring teams from the United States, England and Canada. In honor of the event, Evansville mayor Lloyd Winnecke declared the week of the event to be \\"Roller Derby Week\\" in the city. History and construction The Ford Center was designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport) as a replacement for Roberts Municipal Stadium. The $127.5 million arena was approved by the Evansville City Council on December 22, 2008. Demolition work on the site began on December 5, 2009. The Ford Center is bounded by Main Street, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, 6th Street, and Walnut Street. As planned, it will eventually connect to a new convention hotel and the existing convention center. On August 17, 2011, the facility's name, Ford Center, was announced. The naming rights were the result of a 10-year, $4.2 million agreement with the Tri-State Ford Dealers. On January 18, 2012, Aces junior Colt Ryan set an arena record with 39 points in a win against the Bradley Braves. In 2016, the ECHL's Evansville IceMen and the City of Evansville failed to come to an agreement on a new lease and the IceMen's owner, Ron Geary, announced his intentions to relocate the team to Owensboro, Kentucky. In response, the City of Evansville brought in a new minor league hockey team called the Evansville Thunderbolts as part of the Southern Professional Hockey League for the 2016‚Äì17 season.

He is currently the editor of the Bengali-language daily Amader Orthoneeti and English-language daily The Our Time.[Amader Orthoneeti has been being published from Dhaka since 2008.] He is best known for his introduction of the modern approach of Bengali daily newspapers with the illustrated daily, Ajker Kagoj, launched in 1990. He was also the founding editor of the popular daily Amader Shomoy in 2003. He frequently appears on TV talk-shows since 2007. Life Born on 21 January 1958, Nayeemul Islam Khan is from Comilla. He was the eldest among the 6 children of Nurul Islam Khan, a politician and lawyer, and Nurun Nahar Khan, their mother. He studied at the Comilla Zilla School and passed SSC examination, then went to Dhaka University and obtained his B.A and M.A in Mass Communication & Journalism. He worked with the Bangladesh Center for Development and Journalism and married Nasima Khan. In 2007 he joined the Stamford University, Dhaka as adjunct faculty in the Department of Journalism and Media Studies. Career in journalism Nayeemul Islam Khan's debut as an editor was for the short-lived monthly magazine Shomoy that was published for a few months in 1982. His next project was editing Khoborer Kagoj, which made its debut as a weekly in 1987.Khoborer Kagoj published a weekly column by Mymensingh-based poet and gynaecologist Taslima Nasreen. He is acclaimed as the father of modern approach to the Bengali-language newspaper for his work at Ajker Kahoj, in which he served as editor from its founding 1990 until 1992. In 2002, he re-joined the Ajker Kahoj as advisory editor. That newspaper later closed in 2007. In 1992, he also founded another Bengali-language daily Bhorer Kagoj, which was later edited by Matiur Rahman. Both Ajker Kahoj and Bhorer Kagoj were non-traditional in style and tone. He quit the Bhorer Kagoj in 1992 to run the non-governmental organisation Bangladesh Centre for Development, Journalism and Communication. He made an abortive attempt to publish another daily under the title Notundhara. He also started his own daily, Amader Shomoy in 2007 but was removed as publisher by a court order in 2012. It was a four-page daily that cost TK 2. Attacked In 2013, Khan and his wife were returning home from a social event on 11 March when his car, which was clearly marked as a car belonging to the media, was attacked with molotov cocktails, one of which hit the car. He and his wife had to go to the hospital for treatment. The source of the attacks is unknown. The International Federation of Journalists believed he could have been targeted as he had been making frequent television appearances. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for quick investigations and demanded the violence directed against journalists be stopped. Publications * Aprotiruddhyo Utthan (Tr.

Butterflies of the East Coast. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. is a butterfly native to North America. It belongs in the family Lycaenidae. Description C. g. nelsoni C. g. siva The juniper hairstreak has many subspecies or races, some of which may even be separate species. The upper side of the \\"olive\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. gryneus) is tawny orange or a bronzy color in males, and blackish brown in females. The underside of the wings is bright green with a variable amount of brown scaling. There are two white postbasal spots and a white zigzag postmedian line edged inward with brown on the hindwing.Brock, Jim P. & Kenn Kaufman (2003). Butterflies of North America. Houghton Mifflin, New York NY. \\"Sweadner's\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. sweadneri) is very similar to the gryneus race except the two white postbasal spots are reduced. The \\"Siva\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. siva) is also similar to the gryneus race. It lacks the postbasal spots, the postmedian line is straight, and some individuals are brown. Intermediates of the gryneus and siva races occur in west Texas and New Mexico.Scott, James A. (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. The underside of \\"Nelson's\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. nelsoni) is brown with a violet sheen; the white postmedian line is faint, sometimes partial or absent; and the postbasal spots are lacking. \\"Muir's\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. muiri) is similar to the nelsoni race except the underside of the wings are a darker brown with a purplish- greenish tint, and the postmedian line is partial to complete. The underside of the \\"Loki\\" juniper hairstreak (C. g. loki) is green to purplish brown. Inward of the white postmedian line, the hindwing often has a dark band. \\"Thorne's juniper hairstreak (C. g. thornei) is quite similar to the loki race except it usually lacks green more often being a violet brown to a brownish gray color. Similar species The Hessel's hairstreak (Callophrys hesseli) is the only similar species in the juniper hairstreak's range. The Hessel's hairstreak is similar to the gryneus and sweadneri races. It is often more of a blue-green color, the postmedian line is edged with brown on both sides, and it has a white spot near the fore wing costa. Another related butterfly species found in North America is Callophrys xami, which is commonly referred to as the xami hairstreak or green hairstreak. Aesthetically, C. gryneus differs significantly from C. xami in regards to the postmedian white line running across the butterfly wings as the juniper species lacks the sharp W mark, a distinctive feature of C. xami butterfly wings, in the postmedian white band. Habitat Habitats include bluffs, open fields, barrens, and dry or rocky open places. They are almost always found near or on junipers in these habitats. Nectar plants Both sexes visit flowers near the host plant, especially the sweadneri race. Life cycle Males are highly territorial on cedar trees, where they perch in search of females. Often, males can be set in flight by gently shaking the trees. Females lay their eggs singly at the tip of host plant leaves. The eggs are pale green with white ridges. The larvae are vivid green with a faint middorsal stripe that begins at the thorax and runs down the abdomen. Whitish-yellow spots occur on either side of the middorsal stripe. A whitish-yellow subspiracular stripe (sometimes broken between segments) runs the length of the body.Wagner, David L. (2005). Caterpillars of Eastern North America. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. The chrysalis of the gryneus race is brown to pale brown and is mottled with black with the abdomen being a bit reddish. Chrysalids of western races are dark brown. The juniper hairstreak overwinters as a chrysalis. The gryneus race has two broods per year; sweadneri, two broods per year; siva, two or three broods per year; nelsoni, one brood; muiri, one brood; loki, one or two broods; and the thornei race has one brood per year. Host plants Host plants of the juniper hairstreak: * Eastern redcedar, Juniperus virginiana (used by the gryneus and sweadneri races) * California incense- cedar, Calocedrus decurrens (used by the nelsoni race) * Western red-cedar, Thuja plicata (used by the nelsoni race) * Sargeant's cypress, Cupressus sargentii (used by the muiri race) * Tecate cypress, Cupressus forbesii (used by the thornei race) * Common juniper, Juniperus communis (used by the siva race) * Alligator juniper, Juniperus deppeana (used by the siva race) * Utah juniper, Juniperus osteosperma (used by the siva race) * Rocky Mountain juniper, Juniperus scopulorum (used by the siva race) * Ashe juniper, Juniperus ashei (used by the gryneus race) * California juniper, Juniperus californica (used by the siva and loki races)Stewart, Bob; Priscilla Brodkin; and Hank Brodkin (2001).

Metabolite Labs., Inc., 548 U.S. 124 (2006) (dissenting opinion of Breyer, J.). The question, as Baron Alderson posed it, was ‚Äú[W]here is the difference between claiming a principle, which is to be carried into effect any way you will, and claiming a mere principle?‚ÄùNeilson, 151 Eng. Rep. at 1272, 8 M. & W. at 820, Web. at 369. The answer, as the opinions of the various courts that have considered the matter develop, is nowhere.It might be thought that, under the machine-or-transformation test, patent-eligibility could be based on the transformation of cast iron to steel. That would fail, however, because the mere transformation of iron into steel was old and well known. But if the transformation would be to an improved quality of iron, perhaps lower carbon iron (as it was), the argument might prevail. It is doubtful that any of the courts considering Neilson had that concept or understood the technology. For a discussion of the point, see Richard H. Stern, Mayo v. Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths, [2012] 502, 503-04 & n.17. Facts Neilson's 1829 hot blast apparatus, employed at the Clyde Iron Works, Glasgow Before Neilson's discovery of the hot-blast process, it was commonly believed that the manufacture of iron was more effective the colder the air blast was, and ironmasters therefore attempted to lower the temperature of the air in the blast.James Beaumont Neilson, ; see also Cold blast. Neilson discovered that a blast furnace for converting high-carbon iron to lower-carbon iron or steel worked better if the air was heated before being blown through the molten iron. He therefore passed the air through a heated chamber on its way to the molten iron. The relevant technology is discussed elsewhere in Wikipedia.Blast furnace. It is also discussed in Stern, Mayo v Prometheus, [2012] at 503-04 & n.17. Neilson did not specify in detail what form the chamber for heating the air should take. He merely said: > The air-vessel or receptacle may be conveniently made of iron, but as the > effect does not depend upon the nature of the material, other metals or > convenient materials may be used. The size of the air-vessel must depend > upon the blast, and upon the heat necessary to be produced. For an ordinary > smith‚Äôs fire or forge, an air-vessel or receptacle capable of containing > 1200 cubic inches will be of proper dimensions; and for a cupola of the > usual size for cast-iron founders, an air-vessel capable of containing > 10,000 cubic inches will be of a proper size. It was asserted that using the hot blast produced three times as much iron with the same amount of fuel as the cold blast did.Neilson in (DNB) at 180 (Leslie Stephen ed. 1894). In addition, the hot blast process permitted the use of cheaper coal instead of more expensive coke, which made it economical to exploit cheaper low-grade iron ore. 1784‚Äì1879, at 173 (1968). Judgment Baron Parke delivered the opinion of the court in this case The Exchequer Court rejected the argument made by the defendants that the patent merely covered the principle that furnace temperature could be increased by injecting hot air instead of cold air into the furnace, for the principle of itself could not be patented. It ruled instead that the patent covered the use of the heated chamber. Baron Parke observed, > We think the case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, > the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical > apparatus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in this ‚Äî by > interposing a receptacle for heated air between the blowing apparatus and > the furnace. In this receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the > application of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he accomplishes > the object of applying the blast, which was before of cold air, in a heated > state to the furnace.Web. Pat. Cases at 370-71. Scope of patent The scope of Neilson's patent was questioned in this and other cases. What constituted a receptacle or reservoir? Some accused infringers used a network of pipes, which they claimed worked better than Neilson‚Äôs box-like receptacle, because of a greater surface area, which facilitated better heat transfer.See Web. Pat. Cases at 304 (defendant‚Äôs argument at trial, describing defendant‚Äôs apparatus). Baron Alderson Baron Alderson said that Neilson‚Äôs patent covered use of an ‚Äúintermediate reservoir between the blast furnace and the bellows.‚Äù Therefore, ‚Äúsurely anybody else may apply the same principle, provided he does not do it by a reservoir intermediately between the blast furnace and the bellows.‚Äù It then became a fact question as to what constituted a ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù. It was for the jury to decide, Baron Alderson said, ‚Äúwhether or not a long spiral pipe is a reservoir,‚Äù for ‚Äúif it be not a reservoir, or a colourable imitation of a reservoir, it is no infringement.‚ÄùSee Neilson, Web. Pat. Cases at 342. Neilson himself apparently thought that it made no difference what the shape of the receptacle was, since his specification said that the shape and form of the receptacle was immaterial.See id. at 371. Further developments Neilson v Harford was only one of some twenty cases that Neilson asserted under his patent in England and Scotland.Jeffrey A. Lefstin, ‚ÄúInventive Concept‚Äù and the Hot-Blast Cases, (Feb. 21, 2014). Application by US Supreme Court The United States Supreme Court explained the Neilson decision in O'Reilly v. Morse:56 U.S. (15 How.) 62 (1853). > It is very difficult to distinguish it [the Neilson patent] from the > specification of a patent for a principle, and this at first created in the > minds of the Court much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think > that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine, > embodying a principle, and a very valuable one. We think the case must be > considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first > invented a mode of applying it. We think this case must also be considered > as if the principle or mathematical formula were well known. In Parker v. Flook,437 U.S. 584 (1978). the Supreme Court emphasized and adopted Baron Alderson‚Äôs statement in Neilson (repeated in Morse) that ‚Äúthe case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus,‚Äù which is to say that the abstract idea or natural principle must be considered as if part of the prior art and the invention, if any, is in the mechanical implementation of the principle.Baron Alderson said that \\"the principle must be considered as having had an anterior existence before the patent.\\" Webster's Pat. Cases at 324. Thus, if the implementation is concededly conventional, as it was in Flook, or trivial, as it was in Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.,333 U.S. 127 (1948). the subject matter cannot be patented. This analysis was repeated in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2013). In the Neilson opinion, however, there is no mention of whether the expedient of interposing a heated box in the air line involved an inventive step. The mere fact of using any apparatus appears to have been sufficient to take the case out of being one of a patent on a principle. This is quite different from the rule in the Flook, Mayo, and Alice cases, as one commentator has noted: > The rationale of Neilson is that the patent is on an apparatus or machinery > implementing the natural principle, rather than on the principle itself. The > decision does not judge the difficulty or complexity of the implementing > device. It does not consider whether the implementation is trivial, once one > is in possession of the principle. At first blush, heating a receptacle or > its equivalent to get the air hot seems the natural, perhaps the only > sensible, way to heat the air. But this is 170 or more years later and > perhaps we are in no position to judge that. But the question of triviality > in implementation came to the fore in the 20th century and now in Prometheus > as well.Stern, Mayo v Prometheus, [2012] at 504.

By the time Pickman's son took over the family interests, many of the town's early trading firms had moved on to Boston, with subsidiary offices in Salem. Pickman was a partner in the firm Devereux, Pickman & Silsbee and a state senator. Among the wealthiest Salem merchants of his day, Pickman used his own clipper ships to trade with the Far East in an array of goods ranging from indigo and coffee to pepper and spices,Essex Institute Historical Collections, Vol. LVII, Essex Institute, Peabody Essex Museum, Printed for the Essex Institute, Salem, Mass., 1921 and was one of the state's earliest financiers, backing everything from cotton and woolen mills to railroads to water-generated power plants.

In his diary of the journey, Journal of the Belisarius, Pickman noted the appearance of the British fort at Calcutta: \\"Fort St. George is a handsome brick fortification. It appears very strong, but is probably too much extended to make as able a defense as might otherwise be done.\\"Book Extract, The Yankees Have Landed, indiaprofile.com Pickman kept journals on several of his other voyages as supercargo and then owner, and as its charter required, these journals were filed with the East-India Marine Society of Salem. These early documents show the vast reach of the large Salem trading houses. In 1799-1800, for instance, Pickman noted that the Belisarius had traveled first to the island of Tenerife, back to Salem, then on to Madras and Tranquebar, India, before returning to the Massachusetts port loaded with her bounty.Pickman made several trips to India, and kept detailed journals of his visits. The following year, Pickman kept the journal of the voyage of the ship Anna, captained by Benjamin Swett, which sailed from Boston to Sumatra and back in 1801. Pickman made his early career out of repeated trips on the Belisarius. Before the ship went to pieces in a gale in the Bay of Tunis in April 1810, the clipper made repeated voyages to India and Sumatra with several captains in command and Pickman acting as supercargo.

It features a set range of characters and acts repeated on all pieces. This kind of theatre represents a dualism between the wicked (dressed in red, called t√ºrkak or satanak, literally 'the Turkish' or 'the Demons') and the righteous (blue outfit, called kiristiak, 'the Christians'). On every new creation, a different story is staged, where verses are recited in Zuberoan Basque by the players following a pre-established stance and steps on the scene. Singing and dance play an important role too, the performance actually culminating with a choral staging where the collective spirit is voiced. The development of the story is supported by a brass-band and/or the xirula and the psalterium (ttun- ttun). Unlike the other traditional theatrical event of Soule, the maskarada, the pastoral is not a comedy but a tragedy, revolving around a main character, a hero of historical significance, linked to the region or the Basque Country, while prior to the second half of the 20th century the characters portrayed were religious or French national icons. Back then women were banned from playing in the pastorals too, with female roles being performed by men. During the revival of the event in the decades following World War II, this rule was overturned and currently women take part normally in the plays.

The animal is only known from skeletons found in caves of the Nullarbor Plain and is now classified as recently extinct.  Taxonomy  A species of Bettongia, a genus that includes still living species, allied to the subfamily Potoroinae. The description was first published in 1997 by R. A. McNamara, using specimens collected on the Nullarbor Plain from the Koonalda and Weekes Caves. The holotype is part of a juvenile's right jaw, with some teeth absent, obtained at the Koonalda site. The author recognised an earlier description, misidentified as Caloprymnus campestris by Ernest Lundelius and William D. Turnbull in 1984, and the informal reference to an potoroid species. McNamara's paper on the new species details his diagnosis as arising independently, but gives credit for the discovery to earlier worker's identification of the taxon as 'Thomson's unnamed Potoroid' or 'Unnamed potoroid' (Baynes 1987). The epithet pusilla is derived from Latin, a reference to the small size of the animal. The English vernacular Nullarbor dwarf bettong was suggested by McNamara and is used to refer to this species.  Description  Betongia pusilla show a form of dentition and jaw structure that distinguishes them from others of the genus. The mandible is lighter than the extant species, and the teeth are smaller. Molars of Bettongia pusilla are straight sided with an elevated crown, which contrasts with the bulbous shape of other Bettongia species.  Distribution and habitat  Only known from a series of skeletal remains found in caves on the Nullarbor Plain, an arid desert region of southern Australia. The species is assumed to have become extinct in the states of Western and South Australia during the period of colonisation.

The Thai-muslim man was known for his self-sufficient and economical way of living. His lifestyle embodied King Bhumibol Adulyadej's philosophy on self-sufficiency. The elderly man made his living fishing from the Phetchaburi River in Phetchaburi, Thailand. He sold the fish to locals at inexpensive prices in exchange for other necessities. For many years until his death, he refused offers of free food, preferring to live in his small boat.  Biography  In 1993, Pu Yen's wife died. That's when he decided to save on rent by living in a small houseboat in Phetchaburi River. He lived on one small fish each day. If there were extra fish caught, he would sell them at inexpensive prices to locals. In 2004, Pu Yen became famous when a documentary \\"Khon Kon Khon\\" was made about his life and nationally televised. In addition, he was officially recognized by Queen Sirikit and given a covered fiberglass boat on his 105th birthday. Visitors who talked to him said that although he received many guests, he was always welcoming and cheerful to them. He maintained a positive attitude towards life and was a role model of self- sufficiency to many Thais. Although Pu Yen lived in relative peace, he suffered a setback when thieves stole US$2,060 in cash from his small boat. Before his death, he lived a quiet life on his boat under the Lamyai (longan) Bridge in Phetchaburi city. The place where he used to live is marked by a small landing with a small light bulb suspended from a tree. After his death at age 108 on 12 October 2008 from natural causes, he was buried in a local Phetchaburi mosque and the boat was donated to a local museum in the province. Impact Pu Yen's life and death highlighted the plight of many elderly people in Thailand without adequate medical care and attention. Following his death, Thailand's Health Minister Chalerm Yubamrung issued orders for special check-up facilities for the elderly which would shorten the waiting time for receiving health care. Also, the Health Department chief Narongsak Ankhasuwapala has suggested that a club for the elderly be made available in every tambon. Currently, there are over 4,000 registered centenarians in Thailand. Quotations Pu Yen's view on self-sufficiency: \\"Look at the shellfish...with no hands and no feet Yet they manage to survive... What about...people with hands and feet If they can't survive...shouldn't they be ashamed of the shellfish?\\" \\"If there is food, then I eat...if there isn't any, then I don't I don't ask for food from anybody else... It‚Äôs hard to find people who die from hunger‚Ä¶ If they are not sick or unwell.\\" His view on selling and buying: \\"Don't sell things at high prices...then the customers will have an easier time I sell things cheaply. Go ahead and take them. Buy enough so you will have a full pot of curry (food).\\" His view on charities: \\"I can eat free food...but I'd rather not I don't want to bother anybody...no thanks...I'd be too ashamed Vendors buy and sell things... They need to cook. They need to clean.\\" His view on death: \\"Life is like a bridge. There is up and there is down. There is high and there is low.

Bootstrapping nodes are predominantly found in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks because of the dynamically changing identities and configurations of member nodes in these networks. Overview When attempting to join a P2P network, specific discovery or membership protocols (or other configuration information) may be required, and, if a newly joining node is unaware of these protocols, the newly established joining node will not be able to communicate with other nodes and ultimately join the network. Furthermore, these protocols and configuration requirements may dynamically change as the infrastructure and membership of the P2P network evolves. Therefore, there is a need to be able to dynamically inform a newly joining node of the required protocols and configurations. Identifying a bootstrapping node Several methods may be used by a joining node to identify bootstrapping nodes: * A joining node may have been pre-configured with the static addresses of the bootstrapping nodes. In such a case, the bootstrapping node addresses cannot change, and therefore should be fault-tolerant members of the network, which are not able to leave the network. * Alternatively, the bootstrap node can be identified via a DNS service, where a domain name resolves to one of the bootstrapping nodes' addresses. This allows the bootstrapping nodes' addresses to change as needed. Configuration information provided The objective of the bootstrapping node is to provide newly joining nodes with sufficient configuration information so that the new node may then successfully join the network and access resources, such as shared content. Discovery protocol information can instruct the new node how to discover peers on the network. Membership protocol information can instruct the new node how to request-to-join and subsequently join peer groups on the network.

Based on the play of the same name by R. C. Sherriff, the film tells the story of several British army officers involved in trench warfare during the First World War. The film, like the play before it, was an enormous critical and commercial success and launched the film careers of Whale and several of its stars. The following year there was a German film version The Other Side directed by Heinz Paul starring Conrad Veidt as Stanhope and Wolfgang Liebeneiner as Raleigh. The film was banned just weeks after the Nazis took power in 1933. In 1976, the play was adapted again as Aces High with the scenario shifted to the British Royal Flying Corps. The play was adapted for film again with its original title and scenario in 2017. Plot On the eve of a battle in 1918, a new officer, Second Lieutenant Raleigh (David Manners), joins Captain Stanhope's (Colin Clive) company in the British trench lines in France. The two men knew each other at school: the younger Raleigh hero-worshipping Stanhope, while Stanhope has come to love Raleigh's sister. But the Stanhope whom Raleigh encounters now is a changed man who, after three years at the front, has turned to drink and seems close to a breakdown. Stanhope is terrified that Raleigh will betray his decline to his sister, whom he hopes to marry after the war. An older officer, the avuncular Lieutenant Osborne (Ian Maclaren), desperately tries to keep Stanhope from cracking. Osborne and Raleigh are selected to lead a raiding party on the German trenches where a number of raiding party are killed, including Osborne. Later, when Raleigh, too, is mortally wounded, Stanhope faces a desperate time as, grief-stricken and without close friends, he prepares to face another furious enemy attack.

Gerrard as Private Mason * Tom Whiteley as Sergeant Major * Jack Pitcairn as Colonel * Werner Klingler as German prisoner * Gil Perkins as Sergeant Cox * Leslie Sketchley as Corporal Ross Production When Howard Hughes made the decision to turn Hell's Angels into a talkie, he hired a then-unknown James Whale, who had just arrived in Hollywood following a successful turn directing the play Journey's End in London and on Broadway, to direct the talking sequences; it was Whale's film debut, and arguably prepared him for the later success he would have with the feature version of Journey's End, Waterloo Bridge, and, most famously, the 1931 version of Frankenstein. Unhappy with the script, Whale brought in Joseph Moncure March to re-write it. Hughes later gave March the Luger pistol used in the film.Curtis 1998, p. 86. With production delayed while Hughes tinkered with the flying scenes in Hell's Angels, Whale managed to shoot his film adaptation of Journey's End and have it come out a month before Hell's Angels was released. The gap between completion of the dialogue scenes and completion of the aerial combat stunts allowed Whale to be paid, sail back to England, and begin work on the subsequent project, making Whale's actual (albeit uncredited) cinema debut, his \\"second\\" film to be released.

It is based on the 1929 novel of the same title by J. B. Priestley. Plot The plot focuses on the trials and tribulations of a touring concert party known as the Dinky-Doos who are stranded in the English countryside when their manager absconds with the most recent box-office revenue and the lady pianist. Jess Oakroyd, an amiable man who has abandoned his shrewish wife, endears himself to the company with his homespun advice, and they invite him to join them as a carpenter, baggage handler, and dogsbody. Elizabeth Trant comes to their rescue when she decides to use her inheritance to finance the troupe and escape from her boring life in the Cotswolds. Because of his habit of playing the piano late at night, songwriter Inigo Jollifant has been fired from his position at the Washbury Manor School in East Anglia, and he replaces the concert party's recently departed pianist, bringing with him banjo player and illusionist Morton Mitcham. As Miss Trant slowly achieves managerial authority, she encourages the troupe ‚Äì which includes comedian Susie Dean and singer Jerry Jerningham ‚Äì to change its name to The Good Companions. The group continue their tour and eventually arrive at the Sandybay Pavilion, where they play to a full house when a storm forces passersby to seek shelter in the theatre. Their success leads Inigo to contact a music publisher, who buys his songs and arranges for an impresario to see The Good Companions in Sandybay. The producer signs Susie and Jerry for his new revue, and he secures the remaining members of the company bookings in high class towns like Bournemouth. In the end, Miss Trant marries her solicitor, Susie heads to the West End, Inigo makes a fortune with his music, and Jess Oakroyd departs for Ontario, Canada to visit his daughter. Productions After a tryout in Manchester, The Good Companions opened on July 11, 1974 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London and ran for 252 performances. The cast included John Mills as Jess Oakroyd, Judi Dench as Elizabeth Trant, Christopher Gable as Inigo Jollifant, Marti Webb as Susie Dean, Malcolm Rennie as Morton Mitcham, and Ray C. Davis as Jerry Jerningham. Webb replaced Celia Bannerman at short notice during the Manchester tryout when it was decided that Bannerman's singing voice wasn't up to the part. The score was orchestrated by Herbert W. Spencer and Angela Morley. An original cast album was released on compact disc by DRG in September 1992. The concept of a concert party was foreign to American audiences, and a non-musical stage adaptation of the Priestley novel had closed on Broadway after only 68 performances in 1931 so, despite the popularity of the Previn/Mercer score, it was decided not to open a production in New York City.Mordden, Ethan, One More Kiss: The Broadway Musical in the 1970s.

The first vehicle was delivered in 1918. Compared with the G 12, the G 8.3 had one boiler shell and coupled axle fewer.

Life Born the fifth of six children of the shipowner Gioacchino and of Laura Cafiero, he was on his part the shipowner and founder of the Flotta Lauro, one of the most powerful Italian fleets of all time and one of the major fortunes in the south of Italy, in addition to the owner of a true financial empire created by himself. A determining fact in marking the force of his activities was his intuition that his workers should participate in the benefits of their activities. As a politician, he maintained a great popularity and was venerated by the majority of the population of the city of Naples, to the point that in the municipal elections of 1952 and 1956 he received almost 300,000 votes, higher than any number of votes received by any candidate in local elections up to that point. In the general elections of 1953, he received 680,000 votes for the Chamber of Deputies, also a number that had never been achieved before. During the decades of Italian fascism, he was named the National Counsellor of the Chamber of the fasces and the corporations, appointed to this position by Galeazzo Ciano, the son-in-law of Benito Mussolini himself, who was active in shipping commerce. Also during this period he was named president of the Naples football club SSC Napoli, where he succeeded Giorgio Ascarelli. After the war, after an initial participation in the Common Man's Front, he became active in the monarchist movement of Alfredo Covelli and financially supported the birth of the Monarchist National Party (PNM), and was for a long time the mayor of Naples, appreciated and questioned for his management of the public funds. A square in the coastal town of Sorrento is named in his honour. References * Achille Della Ragione. Achille Lauro superstar: la vita, l'impero, la leggenda. Napoli, 2003. * Serena Romano.

The company also operated mines in Las Animas, Routt, Garfield and Gunnison counties. During the 1930s, the company was the second-largest producer of coal by volume in the state of Colorado. However, the company was severely impacted by the Great Depression, declining productivity of local coal deposits, and the increased popularity of natural gas, and went bankrupt in 1944. Founded in the 1870s as Goodridge & Marfell by Henry Goodridge (1832 - ?) and Erie, Colorado pioneer Hiram Marfell (1840-1904), both immigrants from England, the coal dealership was incorporated in 1890 as Stewart Coal & Lime Company, located in Denver. Stewart Coal & Lime Company was purchased in 1893 by the dashing former Nebraska farmer Edgar Edmund Shumway (1862-1914), who launched his coal dealership Shumway & Company in 1891. Shumway's partner in the purchase was Joseph Mitchell Jr. (1847-1921), owner of the New Mitchell mine in Lafayette, Colorado. Mitchell's father, Joseph Sr., was the superintendent at the mine and lived in Lafayette. In July 1894, Shumway and Mitchell changed the name of the company from Stewart Coal & Lime Company to Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, operating at 1609 Curtis in Denver. Fifteen years later and owning eight Southern Colorado and Western Slope coal mines in Rockvale, Sopris, Trinidad, Maitland and Cardiff, E.E. Shumway ‚Äî sans Joseph Mitchell Jr. ‚Äî incorporated under the laws of Wyoming as Rocky Mountain Fuel Company of Wyoming in 1910. In October 1911, RM Fuel purchased the Northern Coal and Coke Company for $5 million from owners F.F. Struby, G.A. Easterly and C.B. Kountze. At its peak in 1898, Northern Coal Co. executives boasted assets exceeding $30 million. RM Fuel borrowed $1 million and raised another $3.8 million via a bond sale to purchase Northern Coal assets that included 2,500 acres of coal land, nine coal mines, several company stores and Denver coal yards. The mines purchased included the Simpson, Rex, Industrial, Vulcan and Nonpareil mines in Boulder County and the coal rights associated with or formerly held by Empire Coal Company, Aguilar Coal and Mining Company, Louisville Coal Mining Company, Imperial Coal Mining Company and Union Pacific Coal Company. The sale also included 214 residential lots in Louisville, 25 residential lots in Lafayette, 1,150 pit cars, 80 air mining machines, 26 horses, 29 wagons and 140 mules. Company President E.E. Shumway died in 1914 from injuries sustained while investigating the aftermath of the disastrous 1913 explosion that killed 37 miners at the Coryell Vulcan mine in Garfield County. David W. Brown (1860-1922), who joined RM Fuel in about 1900, succeeded Shumway. Company financial statements from 1920 show that RM Fuel and its nine-store mercantile division, the Rocky Mountain Stores Company, was managed by D. W. Brown and had over $12 million in assets, $3.5 million in debt and employed 845 people. The company was producing one million tons of coal each year. John J. Roche (1848-1927), a lawyer and banker by trade, interviewed for a position at Rocky Mountain Fuel Company in 1906, then moved his family from Nebraska to Denver in 1907 to join RM Fuel, replacing company Secretary-Treasurer H.E. Stewart. Roche eventually became Vice-President and Treasurer of the company, and took over management of RM Fuel after the death of D.W. Brown in June 1922. The largest stockholder in the company, Roche died in 1927 and left an $128,000 estate. The company is notable among the many coal mine operators in the same region at the time for its leadership by Josephine Roche. She inherited a minority stock ownership from her father upon his death in 1927, becoming vice president of the company in 1928 and president by 1929. Roche was a dedicated believer in labor unions, and soon after becoming president she invited the United Mine Workers of America back to Rocky Mountain Fuel Company's mines, offering top pay and taking actions to repair labor-management relations. This was to the great chagrin of fellow mine owners, who broke the unions in 1914 after years of intense and often violent disputes, culminating in events such as the Columbine Mine and Ludlow Massacres. Roche's pro-labor policies, however, were effective - within a few years, the company's productivity per worker was the best in the state. After leaving the company in 1934 to enter politics, Roche returned in 1937, but even with the active support of her workers she was unable to save the company, which folded in 1944. The company was ordered by bankruptcy court to liquidate assets and all mines ceased operation but the liquidation was not completed. Roche continued in control of the reorganized company and the remaining assets and moved to Washington, D.C. Roche became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company in 1950 and maintained control of the company's non- liquidated assets until her death in 1976. John R. Lawson, unionist and United Mine Workers of America leader during the 1903 Cripple Creek strike and 1913-14 Coalfield War, served as Vice President of the company from 1927 to 1939. Still holding valuable land, water rights and mineral rights, the RM Fuel experienced a resurgence of sorts in the 1970s under direction of Gerald ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù R. Armstrong, who was RM Fuel president from 1973 to 2006.

Spenceans During the early nineteenth century, the Jamaican-born activists William Davidson and Robert Wedderburn were drawn to the politics of Thomas Spence. Aftermath of First World War Many African- Caribbean activists were radicalised while in the British West Indies Regiment (BWIR). Having served in Europe and the Middle East, many of them experienced racism from both British Officers and common soldiers, which alienated them from British nationalism.Winston James, Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: Caribbean Radicalism in Early Twentieth-Century America, Verso, 1998 Some of them from the 9th Battalion had participated in the Taranto Revolt, which started on 6 December 1918, shortly after the armistice. This was stimulated by the War Office refusing to allow the troops of the British West Indies Regiment receive the extra 6 pence a day which had been given to British soldiers. This was explained as being because they were \\"natives\\". The all- white Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps did receive the increment. They were also put to work as labourers for the White Italian Labour Corps. Officers were attacked and explosives and guns were used. The Worcestershire Regiment was dispatched to quell the revolt, and they executed one rebel by firing squad. Nevertheless, some 50 to 60 sergeants met on 17 December to form the \\"Caribbean League\\" which had four meetings in the next few weeks. Aside from addressing various grievances they had, pan-Caribbean sentiments were fostered, and a movement for independence in the West Indies was discussed. This included plans to set up an office in Kingston, Jamaica, and organise strikes. After being betrayed to the authorities, the league was disbanded. In February 1919, Army Order No. 1, granting the wage increase, was extended to the BWIR.

History The Library in the depression era. Founded in December 1838, it was Ohio's first public library created with tax money. There were sixty-six charter members in the association's subscription library. Members paid an annual fee of two dollars. The Ohio General Assembly granted a charter to the Young Men's Association of Toledo for a \\"lyceum and public library.\\" In 1864, Republican members broke off from the Young Men's Association Library and formed the Toledo Library Association. The Librarian was Thomas Blackwell. In 1867, the two groups merged. In 1873, a free public library was organized by an act of the Ohio Legislature. On May 26, City Council passed a resolution creating The Toledo Public Library.First Annual Report, p. 282 Mrs. Anna B. Carpenter was selected as the first Librarian of the Toledo Public Library. On November 3, 1873, the Toledo Public Library opened for its first day of operation on the second floor of the King Block, a commercial building on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and Summit Street.Hibbs, Jack Eugene, A History of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library, 1873-1964 (dissertation) In 1875, Miss Lucy Stevens succeeded Mrs. Carpenter as Librarian. In 1884, Stevens retired and was replaced by Mrs. Frances Jermain. In 1890, Edward O. Fallis designed a new Main Library to be built on the corner of Madison and Ontario in early Norman and Byzantine style. The final cost, including land, construction and some furniture, was $84,793. It opened on June 23, 1890. An addition was built in 1914. In 1902, Jermain retired and was replaced by Willis Fuller Sewall. He left in 1914 and was replaced by Herbert S. Hirschberg. An annex to the main library building saw construction begin in September, 1914, with the grand opening on October 21, 1915. The first full-service branch library opened in April 1915 and was at the Glenwood School. It closed with the opening of the Eliza M. Kent Branch in 1917. Other branch libraries located in schools during the 1920s included Navarre, Nathan Hale, Oakdale-White, Hamilton, McKinley, Arlington, and Harvard schools. In 1916, the Andrew Carnegie Fund offered $125,000 to build five branches on sites to be provided by city. Consulting architect for all five buildings was Edward Tilton of New York. The five branches were the David R. Locke Branch, designed by M.M. Stophlet and opened on December 5, 1917; Eliza M. Kent Branch, designed by L.G. Welker and opened on December 11, 1917 (fire destroyed the original building in 1974); the Anna C. Mott Branch, designed by Bernhard Becker and opened on January 3, 1918; Frances D. Jermain Branch, designed by Bates and Gamble and opened on January 7, 1918; and the South Branch, designed by David L. Stine and Son, opened on January 16, 1918. In 1923, Carl Vitz took over as Librarian. He was succeeded in 1937 by Russell Schunk, on whose watch the current Toledo Lucas County Main Library was built. It is on land that was the former home of the Toledo Central High School. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Hahn and Hayes and opened on September 5, 1940.https://www.toledo.com/area-directory/microsite-toledo- lucas-county-public-library/microsite/ \\"Toledo.com\\" The interior of the building was modeled after the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland. The exterior was modeled on that of Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. The one of the interesting features of the building are the vitrolite murals in the Clyde Scoles Historic Court and the Children's Library. The Local History and Genealogy Department was created when the new building opened. On November 1, 1945, Herbert M. Sewell was named Librarian, taking over for Mr. Vitz; 10 years later, he was succeeded by Robert D. Franklin who stayed as Librarian until the merging of the 3 library systems. The Lucas County Library opened in 1918 at the location that is now known as the Maumee Branch of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library system. Emilie Meuser was the first Director of the Lucas County Library. She was replaced by Dorothy Strouse who served in that role from 1929-1970 when the library systems merged. In 1937 the Lucas County Library system expanded to include bookmobile service for the first time in the county. The Sylvania Public Library was established as a separate entity from the Lucas County Library in 1926 with Amy M. Ramsey as Director. Marie Huff replaced her in 1931 and served as Director until 1943 when Lillian Miller Carroll took over. Janet Boucher became Director in 1950 and was replaced in 1956 by Helen Consear who served until the systems merged. The current system was created in 1970 by the merger of the Toledo Public, Lucas County (established in 1918), and Sylvania Public (established in 1927) libraries. Lewis Naylor was named Director of the combined libraries. Ardath Danforth was named to replace him in 1977. She would leave in 1985, replaced that same year by Clyde Scoles. In 2019 Jason Kucsma became the current Executive Director. With passage of the 1995 levy plans began for the renovation and expansion of the Main Library. The plan was to restore the historic and add to the Art Deco facility. The architectural firm of Munger Munger + Associates Architects, Inc. designed the expansion and renovation of the building. On February 18, 1998 plans for the renovation and expansion were presented to the public, with the official ground-breaking taking place on March 8, 1998. During the project the library was able to stay open, with some temporary modifications to service points, except for the time it took to move the print and audio materials and furnishings to their new locations. The renovated and expanded Main Library reopened in August 2001. The Main Library closed for renovations in September 2018 and was reopened to the public on September 28, 2019. The renovations moved the caf√©; expanded the children's library; and added a gift shop, recording studio, and teaching and community spaces.

There were two variants: the G 8 built from 1902 with a 14 tonne axle load and the \\"reinforced G 8\\" (verst√§rkte G 8) built from 1913 (later designated the G 8.1) with a axle load. The latter was the most numerous German state railway (L√§nderbahn) locomotive, over 5,000 examples being built.  History  A total of 1,054 Prussian G 8 locomotives were built between 1902 and 1913 by various manufacturers. It was the first superheated goods train locomotive in Prussia, which is why it initially suffered from a host of teething troubles. One further problem was the restriction to a axle load; as a result many components had to be made too light in order to save weight. During its period of procurement constant modifications were made to the locomotives: the cylinder bore was increased from ; and the grate area, evaporative heating area and superheater area were also increased in size. Seven engines were experimentally fitted with Stumpf parallel flow cylinders (Gleichstrom- Zylindern). Ten more were given Lenz valve gear. Neither of these variants improved on the standard design however. Tp 3-36, ex 55 2199, Hanomag 6712-1913 After the First World War, 336 locomotives had to be given to Germany's former enemies as reparations and 18 units to the Saar Railway. In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 656 locomotives as Class 55.16-22, numbering them as 55 1601-2256 in their renumbering plan. In 1935 they were joined by another twelve were from the Saarbahn, nos. 55 2257-2268. In the Second World War several more came from Poland and were given the numbers of already retired engines between 55 1604 and 55 1710. After the war the DB ended up with 205 examples, and the DR 50. In the GDR the last one was retired in 1969, whereas the DB had retired them by 1955. After the Second World War, locomotives 55 1681, 1881 and 2180 were left in Austria. No. 55 1881 was returned to the DB in 1950. The two remaining engines formed √ñBB Class 755 in the √ñBB keeping their serial numbers. Number 755.2180 was retired in 1954, and 755.1681 not until 1957. Locomotive Nr. 4981 Mainz (see picture in the infobox) is in working condition. Built in 1913 by Hanomag as No. 6721 and in service with the Prussian state railways as 4981 M√ºnster, it sent was to work in 1916, along with 24 others, on the construction of the Baghdad Railway (Bagdadbahn) in Turkey, where she was given Turkish Railways number 44 079. In 1987, the still operational locomotive was purchased by German railway fans, to be hauled across Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Austria to Germany and restored by the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum. The journey, which had cost 47,000 deutschmarks of which 36,531 DM were invoiced by Deutsche Bahn for the leg in Germany, is documented in a book. Two units of the 22 assigned to Italy as war reparations (and classified by the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane as FS Class 422) survive to this day, both property of the Museo Ferroviario Piemontese; one is exposed at Savigliano, while the other is kept in a nearby railway station.

The institution also acts on cultural and industrial production. Currently, the school of Arts and Crafts unfolds on three different bodies: # The LAO-Industry, which is the result of the dismemberment of the productive activity of the school. It is specialized in the manufacture of meters, gasometers and materials for construction and also acts as a sponsor of educational activities of the Liceu; # The Technical School of the Lyceum of Arts and Crafts of S√£o Paulo, responsible for the end-activity of LAOSP It offers technical and regular education for high school students and technology-related courses and; # The Cultural Center, responsible for the promotion of arts in general and for maintaining the memory of the institution itself. History The institution was created in 1873 by a group belonging to the elite of coffee aristocrats who intended to form specialized labor for a possible future industrialization of the country, according to the positivist ideal that preached the \\"dignity of man through work\\". Initially it took the name \\"Propagator Society for People Instruction\\". During its early years, it was not intended to promote professional education. Nightly courses of first letters and Arithmetic, among others, were lectured for adults and children. Since then, however, there was already a Superior Council (chaired by the Director Le√¥ncio de Carvalho) which represented the elite of Sao Paulo at that period. After seven years, the Superior Council decided to completely reformulate the institution and turn it into a technical school. By then, the school had not yet a head office nor curriculum guidelines and the model adopted for the new institution was the European experiences of schools of Arts and Crafts (idealized by William Morris) . The Arts and Crafts Movement had already been happening in Europe for some time and preached the value of the manual work of craftsmen in the capitalist industry. With the adoption of the name Lyceu de Artes e Officios, the new model began to be applied and courses of carpentry, locksmiths, cast, design, among others, were lectured, in the spirit of bourgeois positivist- Arts and Crafts. From 1890, architect Francisco de Paula Ramos de Azevedo took the direction of the Liceu, and was responsible for a new reform of the school curriculum and administration that would make it thrive in an unprecedented manner. Ramos de Azevedo was also a founder of Polytechnic School of the future University of S√£o Paulo, and brought from Belgium an entrepreneurial spirit that would meet the interests of the Superior Council. From his reform on, the students of the school began receiving financial support for the work they produced. This work would carry the brand of quality of the school and sold throughout the country. With this model, the LAOSP has become self- sufficient and independent. The school's financial prosperity enabled the creation of a permanent head office. In 1897 the Technical Office Ramos de Azevedo started the project the Pra√ßa da Luz building, which was never completely concluded, but was delivered in 1900. This building, through an agreement with the State of Sao Paulo, would be shared between the newly created LAOSP and the art gallery Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo. The building of Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo, originally intended to house both the State of S√£o Paulo art collection and the School of Arts and Crafts Industrial production of Liceu prospered significantly during periods of World Wars, with the increased consumption of items produced in the country, due to the reduction of imports. In this period, names like Victor Brecheret, Alberto Santos-Dumont, and Adoniran Barbosa have been through the School. It became the main promoter and director of works in art nouveau style in Brazil. From the 1950s on, the country adopted new model of industrial development, and the craftsmen of the Lyceum became inadequate for the new production activities. There was a separation between the industrial activity of the institution and its educational section. All the original ideal of inseparability between art and industry was lost from there. Among the products of this new industrial phase are the implementation of casings at the MASP; accomplishment of part of the furniture Cumbica International Airport and production of 24-hour cash machines. In the 1970s, with a new curriculum reform, the Technical School itself is established. The first courses were Edification (EDI), Machinery and Engines (Into Mechanics - MEC - later), Decoration, Electronics (ELO) and later of Design Construction (DCC) and Electrotechnics. Four of these courses (EDI, ELO, MEC and DCC) represented the core teaching of the school and survived until 2002, the date of graduation of its latest class. Throughout history, the school was guided by a group of principles of action generally linked to free education, vocational training and humanistics. Recently, however, through the reforms implemented by LAO-Industry, a paid model of education was instituted, and professional education was completely separated from regular high school course. =Works with the brand Liceu= The following list comprises buildings and monuments in which there are records of the actions of the school, whether in its construction process or in the materials employed . * Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo - ornaments shaped by apprentices of the Lyceum. * Teatro Municipal de S√£o Paulo - huge chandelier in the atrium was produced in the workshops of the Lyceum. * Palace of Industries of Sao Paulo - lightning rod made by the school. * J√∫lio Prestes Station - frames executed by Lyceum. * Monument to Duque de Caxias - shaped in the Lyceum. * Monumento a Ramos de Azevedo - shaped in the Lyceum, under the guidance of Galileo Emendabili. * Monument to the Bandeiras - shaped in the Lyceum, under the guidance of Victor Brecheret.

The BKA operated from February 23, 1944 to April 28, 1945. The 20,000 strong Byelorussian Home Defence Force was formed under the leadership of Commissioner-General Curt von Gottberg, with logistical help from the German 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS known as the \\"Poachers' Brigade\\" commanded by Oskar Dirlewanger. Creation After the Wehrmacht suffered two major strategic defeats at Stalingrad (in February 1943) and at Kursk (in August 1943) the Germans made some concessions to the Byelorussian collaborators by proposing a Byelorussian quasi-state. Assistance was offered by the local administrative governments from the Soviet era, and former members of public organizations including the Soviet Belarusian Youth. On March 6, 1944 the general mobilization of all healthy men born between 1908 and 1924 into the BKA started. Some 40,000 individuals reported to recruitment bureaus set up in seven cities; although 30% of them were sent back home on German orders for overcrowding. From each region (Uezd) about 500 to 600 men were recruited, for the total of 28,000 soldiers ready for training. On March 26, all men already enlisted to the BKA gave their oath at Freedom Square in Minsk: > \\"I swear, that arm to arm with the German soldier, I will not lay down my > weapons until there is peace and security in our farms and cities, until in > our land the last enemy of the Byelorussian people is destroyed.\\" The oath was accepted by the BKA commander Ivan Yermachenka, in the presence of the SS and Police Leader Curt von Gottberg. The president of the Byelorussian Central Council, Radas≈Ça≈≠ Astro≈≠ski, had concerns that some Soviet partisans might have infiltrated the new BKA structures and that therefore it would need a thorough inspection afterwards. On March 31, 1944, the BKA battalions received their individual designations. In total, there were 45 battalions formed, mostly infantry. However, to prevent possible staged desertions to \\"forest people\\" weapons were handed out only during training exercises with nothing to spare. The German SS didn't have enough officers to train all of them, therefore a few thousand members of the Byelorussian Auxiliary Police, not older than 57 years and Unteroffiziers not older than 55 years of age (except those protecting the collaborationist government), were brought into the fold of BKA. Organization was controlled by the German Police and SD commandants. In mid-June 1944 an officer school for BKA volunteers was started by the German SS in Minsk, but the city was overrun by the Soviets only two weeks later. After evacuating the Council to K√∂nigsberg and soon to Berlin in November 1944 along with upper echelon, the 1st personnel battalion was formed. Meanwhile, battalions of BKA on Byelorussian territory, were mainly used in anti-partisan operations and later at the front against the Red Army. Dissolving The BKA ceased to exist after Red Army regained control in the Byelorussian SSR. Some BKA units retreated to the West and became the base for the creation of the Schutzmannschaft-Brigade Siegling. Many conscripts quietly went back home to their Byelorussian villages. The BCR existed till late 1980s in the United States and president Radas≈Ça≈≠ Astro≈≠ski worked till 1960. Most of its members, as members of other organizations, received political asylum as immigrants. In April and May 1945, most of the BKA and SBM submitted to Russian Liberation Army surrendered to the western Allies. Later propagandists hold that the Byelorussian Liberation Armies 1st personnel battalion in Berlin in fact was a reserve for the 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian). Eleven its officers, including B. D. Rahula and others entered the 1st Grenadier Sturm Brigade SS \\"Byelorussia\\", formed in Nazi Germany; it was sent to the Battle of Monte Cassino, and acted against the II Corps (Poland) of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders (Anders Army). BKA soldiers were not trusted by the Germans, which explains why Russian Liberation Army formations weren't sent to the Eastern Front, and combat at Western Front.

It documents Shopsins restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village and its owner and head cook, Kenny Shopsin. In 2002 and 2003, Mahurin followed Shopsin in his final year at the location he ran for over 30 years. Throughout the film, Shopsin offers what he calls \\"half- baked\\" philosophy, peppered with profanities. In the first half, Shopsin opens his eatery for the day and talks about his kitchen, his business, his employees, and his customers. We meet the regulars and friends who eat some of the 900 eclectic dishes he prepares, and we learn the rules of the restaurant: all customers must eat, parties of four or more are unwelcome, and anyone who irritates the owner will be swiftly shown the door. Shopsin's wife and children, all of whom work at the restaurant, weigh in on what it's like to work for this eccentric and occasionally hot-tempered man. In the film's second half, Shopsin loses his lease and is forced to move his establishment to a larger location on nearby Carmine Street. Family, friends, and customers all pitch in to help with the move. Everything must go, from hundreds of knick-knacks and supplies to an alarmingly rickety stove. The reopening is a resounding success. The epilogue grants the audience one last glimpse of Shopsin's life the following year, and it is revealed that Shopsin's wife has died, but he seems not to have changed at all. Shopsin, who has been profiled in The New Yorker by Calvin Trillin, wrote a 2008 book with Carolynn Carre√±o entitled Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin.

Simonson, New York; Caroline Rautz-Rees, Greenwich, CT; and Hamilton Holt, New York, Chair. The Woodrow Wilson Foundation was an educational non-profit created in 1921, organized under the laws of New York, for the \\"perpetuation of Wilson's ideals\\" via periodic grants to worthy groups and individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the chair of the group's governing National Committee, coordinating fundraising activity of parallel groups in each of the 48 states. The group sought to gather a $1 million endowment fund, the interest on which was to pay for the group's cash awards. A national fundraising drive to raise the endowment was launched on January 16, 1922, but despite extensive organization and relentless publicity only half the financial target was raised by February 15. With its medal and endowment to allow for annual financial prizes, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in its initial iteration resembled the Nobel Foundation and its Nobel Prizes, albeit on a smaller financial scale. Beginning in 1963 the Woodrow Wilson Foundation financed publication of Wilson's collected works and related documents, a 69-volume series entitled The Papers of Woodrow Wilson. The difficulty and expense of this nearly 30-year project drained the energy and finances of the organization, which was terminated in 1993 ‚Äî one year before completion of the Wilson Papers project. Organizational historyEstablishment= The original idea for establishment of an endowed fund to make financial awards to individuals and groups best advancing the ideals of Wilsonianism was credited to Mrs. Charles E. Simonson of New York,Nation-Wide Canvass for Woodrow Wilson Foundation Launched Yesterday by Franklin Roosevelt,\\" Bisbee [AZ] Daily Review, Jan. 17, 1922, pg. 2. who was previously active in a women's group called the Political Equality Club of Richmond County.Year Book of the New York Federation of Women's Clubs, 1916. Syracuse, NY: Lyman Brothers, 1916; pg. 133. The fund was envisioned as a way to make permanent the memory and legacy of Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States from 1913 to 1920. The Woodrow Wilson Foundation was provisionally established on December 23, 1920, with formal organization completed at a meeting held in New York City on March 15, 1921.James Langland (ed.), The Chicago Daily News Almanac and Year- Book for 1926. Chicago, IL: Chicago Daily News Company, 1925; pg. 47. The organization was established independently of former President Woodrow Wilson but named in his honor by organizers, who pointed to Wilson having \\"further the cause of human freedom\\" and for having been \\"instrumental in pointing out effective methods for the cooperation of the liberal forces of mankind throughout the world.\\" Organizers planned on raising funds in order to make cash awards to help support the world of individuals and groups that had rendered \\"meritorious service to democracy, public welfare, liberal thought, or peace through justice.\\"United Press International, \\"Will Organize 'Woodrow Wilson Foundation': Income Will Be Devoted to Awards for Greatest Accomplishments in Aid of Humanity,\\" Dunkirk [NY] Evening Observer, Aug. 5, 1921, pg. 1. It was hoped to raise $1 million to endow the foundation. Based upon prevailing interest rates of the day, it was reckoned that a $1 million endowment would generate about $50,000 in interest each year in perpetuity, enabling annual awards in that amount.\\"No Limit on Awards by Wilson Foundation,\\" Washington Times, April 17, 1922, pg. 3. =Structure= Franklin D. Roosevelt, shown here in 1913 as a young cabinet official in the Wilson administration, was Chairman of the National Committee of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. Chairman of the National Committee of the Wilson Foundation from 1921 was former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and future President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\"Seek Fund to Honor Wilson,\\" Washington Post, June 26, 1921, pg. 81. Roosevelt asserted that by donating to the endowment fund of the Wilson Foundation, \\"the American people will be given and opportunity to express their appreciation of Mr. Wilson's services to humanity.\\" Executive Director of the fund at the time of its establishment was editor of the internationalist news magazine The Independent, Hamilton Holt. Financier Cleveland H. Dodge was named the chair of the provisional Executive Committee. The temporary Executive Committee included 9 other luminaries, including close Wilson adviser Edward M. House, American representative to the Paris Peace Conference Frank Polk, and the wife of publishing mogul Malcolm Forbes. Other prominent supporters of the project included businessman and former ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and Adolph Ochs, publisher of the New York Times. The Woodrow Wilson Foundation was based in New York City, with its national office located at 150 Nassau Street.\\"The Woodrow Wilson Foundation,\\" Reidsville [NC] Review, Aug. 23, 1921, pg. 4. The organization was formally governed by a National Committee, consisting of more than 250 representatives from each state,\\"Campaign to Establish the Woodrow Wilson Foundation,\\" Woman's Enterprise [Baton Rouge, LA], Jan. 13, 1922, pg. 1. which elected in turn a National Executive Committee to handle the day-to-day operations of the organization. During the main fundraising campaign to build the organization's endowment fund, which launched in October 1921, the Wilson Foundation named chairs for each state to coordinate fundraising activities on a state basis.See, for example, \\"Woodrow Wilson Foundation Aides in Oregon Named,\\" Oregon Daily Journal [Portland], Sept. 18, 1921, pp. 1, 10. These, in turn, named county chairs to help localize fundraising activity. This system was roughly analogous to the wartime sales of Liberty bonds, which made similar use of formal state and local officers to coordinate sales. By the end of September 1921, chair of the National Executive Committee Cleveland Dodge boasted that 37 of the 48 American states had been organized on such a basis.\\"Spangler Denies He Has Quit Politics; Is Now Probing Own Downfall: State Political Gleanings,\\" Harrisburg [PA] Evening News, Sept. 30, 1921, pg. 19.

Chief on the agenda was the need to determine the mechanism for awarding the Foundation's prize awards. The National Committee also began the process of naming 15 permanent trustees of the Wilson Foundation's assets, recommending Franklin Roosevelt, Cleveland Dodge, feminist leader Carrie Chapman Catt, university president E. A. Alderman, and William Allen White of Kansas. The other 10 trustees were to be named later by the Executive Committee, the National Committee decided. The 15 Trustees were to provide annual funds, generated through investment of the endowment in government securities, to a 25-member \\"Jury of Awards,\\" the members of which were to serve 9-year terms.Cleveland M.

Plans were made for the gathering of \\"$1,000,000 or more\\" to provide a permanent endowment for the Wilson Foundation's prizes. Donors were to receive an attractive certificate in acknowledgment of their donations, with the motif determined through an artistic contest in the fall of 1921. Monday, January 16, 1922, was scheduled for the mass launch of the endowment-raising campaign. In an event to generate a tidal wave of energy, enthusiasm, and publicity to start the fundraising campaign, even the January 16 date was more tightly focused, with the National Committee advising through the Wilson Foundation's official organ, The Foundation News Letter, that the hour of noon until 1 pm be declared \\"The Wilson Hour,\\" in which all supporters of Wilson's ideas should show up in person at their local office of the Wilson Foundation to make donations in person.\\"A Wilson Hour Fixed,\\" Lincoln County [NC] News, Jan. 2, 1922, pg. 3. In addition, the Wilson Foundation made use of newspaper advertisingSee, for example, \\"Do It Now\\" (ad), Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 11, 1922, pg. 7. and planned a fundraising canvas in connection with its January 1922 endowment drive. Rather than a door-to-door drive, this canvas seems to have taken the form of volunteers from various organizations, frequently women, operating fundraising tables at banks, drug stores, and other well-trafficked places.\\"Wilson Foundation Canvas is Kept Up,\\" Charlotte News, Jan. 16, 1922, pg. 2. The Monday, January 16 focused fundraising event was to be preceded by mass meetings in major cities on Saturday, January 14, and by advocacy of the project by religious ministers speaking from the pulpit on what was deemed \\"Woodrow Wilson Sunday,\\" January 15.Speakers fo Wilson Fund to Open City Drive: John Temple Graves, Hamilton Holt and Others to Address Mass Meeting,\\" Washington Times, Jan. 14, 1922, pg. 10. Both of these tactics ‚Äî the use of fundraising rallies and coordination of fundraising through Sunday sermons by friendly ministers ‚Äî were revisitations to tried-and-true methods used in generating funds for the Liberty Loans during wartime. Despite planning for a mass launch of fundraising activities, funds were already being raised by the various state organizations by December 1921, with temporary receipts being provisionally provided until the engraved certificates for donors were ready for distribution the following month.\\"Wilson Foundation in New Quarters: Attached Coupon for Subscribers,\\" Oregon Daily Journal, Dec. 23, 1921, pg. 17. The organization took pains to emphasize that operation costs of the organization were previously covered by supporters of the project and that \\"every dollar received by the National Treasurer\\" in the January 1922 endowment drive was to be put towards the endowment for the Wilson Foundation's awards. State and local fundraising quotas were set and \\"canvassing\\" continued throughout the month of January and into February as funds slowly rolled in.See, for example, \\"No Work Done on Foundation Fund,\\" Durham [NC] Morning Herald, Jan. 28, 1922, pg. 5. The drive seems to have begun to run out of steam late in February 1922,See, for example, \\"Warren Short on Wilson Fund,\\" Warren [NC] Record, Feb. 17, 1922, pg. 1. with many locales failing to meet their fundraising targets and the national fundraising effort coming up far short of its $1 million goal. On February 11 the Foundation's official News Letter announced that Oklahoma had thus far led all states with fulfillment of 67% of its financial target; an optimistic spin was placed on the ongoing fundraising effort, which was characterized as just launching at that late date in some localities.\\"Status of the Foundation,\\" Charlotte Observer, Feb. 17, 1922, pg. 6.

By the end of 1922, only $800,000 had been raised. =Awards= The Celestial Sphere Woodrow Wilson Memorial, by Paul Manship, presented in 1939 to the League of Nations by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and installed in Geneva. On April 16, 1922, Frank L. Polk announced on behalf of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation that the organization would make its awards internationally, not limiting prize winners to Americans. It would remain to the 15 member Board of Trustees to determine the size and frequency of such awards, Polk noted. An awards jury of 9 was decided upon late in 1923, headed by the elderly former President of Harvard College, Charles William Eliot.\\"Wilson Foundation Award in 1924: Prize of $25,000 to Be Given,\\" Decatur [IL] Daily Review, Jan. 1, 1924, pg. 21. Owing to the failure of the fund to achieve its $1 million target, awards of $25,000 were declared for the first three years ‚Äî somewhat less than the estimated $27,000 in interest revenue generated by the endowment. Nominations were to remain open until June 1, with the award made in conjunction with the December 28th birthday of Wilson. Prizes were to be granted to individuals, not organizations, it was decided, with \\"unselfish public service of enduring virtue\\" held to be the chief qualification of award recipients. The Wilson Foundation made its first award, a bronze medal 12 inches in diameter and a cash award of $25,000, in the fall of 1924 to Robert Cecil ‚Äî a British architect of the League of Nations. With its medal and endowment to allow for annual financial prizes, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in its initial iteration resembled the Nobel Foundation and its Nobel Prizes, albeit on a smaller financial scale. The choice of Cecil was editorially lauded by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which called the British statesman a man who had \\"labored arduously and unselfishly for the realization of Mr. Wilson's ideals.\\"\\"A Great Prize Worthily Bestowed,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Dec. 29, 1924; pg. 6. Although approximately 1,000 people gathered at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan for the annual banquet of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation to eulogize the late President on what would have been his 69th birthday in December 1925,\\"Hail Locarno Pact as Achievement of Wilson's Idealism,\\" Dec. 29, 1925, pg. 5. no prize was granted in that year owing to a failure of the award jury to agree upon a worthy candidate.\\"Wilson Award for Unselfish Act Delayed,\\" Oakland Tribune, Jan. 6, 1926, pg. 10. A second medal and $25,000 award was made in 1926 to former Senator, Republican Secretary of State, and 1912 Nobel Peace Prize winner Elihu Root.\\"Wilson Medal for Root Pleasing to Democrats,\\" The Pantagraph [Bloomington, IL], Dec. 31, 1926, pg. 4. Root was recognized for his advocacy of American entry into the League of Nations ‚Äî regarded by the decision-makers of the Wilson Foundation as a fundamental principle of Wilsonian internationalism. Root promptly signed over his prize check to the fledgling magazine Foreign Affairs, which was itself attempting to build an endowment fund to insure its longterm survival.\\"Root's Prize Money to Aid Peace,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Jan. 2, 1927, pg. 26.

The lucrative essay competition was to be opened to anyone between the ages of 20 and 30, with submissions to close on October 1. Once again the prize jury could not agree, however, and no $25,000 first prizes or $1,000 second prizes were granted; instead 14 \\"third prizes\\" of $100 were paid, a tiny fraction of the purported prize pool.\\"Wilson Essay Prizes Given to Fourteen: No First or Second Places are Allowed by Jury of Award,\\" Anniston [AL] Star, Dec. 29, 1927, pg. 1.

Ironically, Lindbergh would later become the face of a most un-Wilsonian isolationism in the 1930s. The following year the Wilson Foundation chose to honor the League of Nations, with the $25,000 prize expected to be used for the construction of a monument to President Wilson at League headquarters in Geneva.\\"Peace Prize is Given to League: Woodrow Wilson Prize for 1929 Goes to Geneva,\\" Sterling [IL] Daily Gazette, Dec. 28, 1929, pg. 1.

Princeton housed Wilson's papers and provided the staff for the project. The first volume was published in 1966 and the final volume in 1994. The Wilson Papers project consumed all of the energies and funds of the foundation during its thirty-year duration. Following the publication of the final volume, the foundation intended to return to its support of research, but the financial outlay proved to have been too great, and the foundation was terminated in 1993.\\"Woodrow Wilson Foundation Records 1888-1987 (mostly 1921-1963): Finding Aid,\\" Seeley G.

They specialized in small motors, fire alarm systems, telegraph-related products, and various other electric devices. The company closed in 1972. Antique Holtzer-Cabot coded fire alarm pull station. History Charles Holtzer founded the company as \\"Holtzer Co.\\" and began manufacturing simple electrical devices such as doorbells and electric igniters. In 1880, Seth W. Fuller partnered with Holtzer, and the company became known as \\"Seth W. Fuller & Holtzer\\", and later as \\"Fuller, Holtzer & Company\\". George E. Cabot joined the business, and Fuller left in 1889. The company then changed its name to \\"Holtzer-Cabot\\", which remained their name until their closing. In 1891, the company built an electric car that sat four people and moved approximately 16 MPH. It was the first to feature a steering wheel, and is known as the first successful electric vehicle in America, though other unsuccessful prototypes had been built before. Around the turn of the 20th century, the company branched out to create various telephone/telegraph-related products, clocks, and fire alarm systems. They invented the first shunt-type fire alarm system, where a local alarm pulled in a building would also trigger the nearest municipal street fire alarm box. Most of their fire alarm systems were installed in hospitals, factories, and institutions. In 1927, Charles Holtzer died. Throughout World War II, the company branched out even more, but struggled to retain business. In 1972, the company officially closed and sold the remainder of their lines to Eastern Air Devices based in Dover NH (Now known as Electrocraft). The original factory in Jamaica Plain, MA still exists, but has now been converted to an apartment complex.
