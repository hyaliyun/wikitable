He bats and throws right handed. In a twelve-season career, Carrasco has posted a 44‚Äì50 record with 19 saves and a 3.99 ERA in 637 relief appearances and ten starts. Career Carrasco began his major league career with the Cincinnati Reds in , and has also pitched for the Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, Washington Nationals, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On April 15, , while pitching for the Twins, Hector gave up Cal Ripken's 3000th hit in a game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. His most productive season came in for the Nationals, when he was 5‚Äì4 with a 2.04 ERA in 64 appearances, allowing only 59 hits in innings and limiting opponents to a .193 batting average. He was 4‚Äì3 with a 2.04 ERA in 62.2 innings as a reliever, and 1‚Äì1 with a 2.03 ERA in 27 2.3 innings while starting five games near the season's end. In , Carrasco pitched for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Japan's Pacific League, going 8‚Äì8 with five saves and a 5.57 ERA in 53 relief appearances. He began the 2005 season at the then Washington Nationals' Triple-A affiliate, New Orleans Zephyrs, where he was 1‚Äì0 with four saves in eight games without allowing an earned run, before being called up and having a terrific year for the Nats. He made 64 appearances (10th in the league), primarily as the set up man for closer Chad Cordero, pitching innings, with an ERA of just 2.04, although he also started five games. His WHIP (BB + H per IP) was 1.098, which would have been good enough for fifth in the league had he had the requisite number of innings pitched. Following the 2005 season, Carrasco filed for free agency, and was signed by the Angels to a $6.1 million, two-year contract. In , Carrasco was 7‚Äì3 with a 3.41 ERA in 56 appearances, three as a starter. But in , after 29 appearances where he posted an ERA of 6.57, and allowing 8 HR's in innings, he was released. The following week, Carrasco returned to the Nationals organization by signing a minor league contract. On Jan. 24, , Carrasco signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Pirates. He was released on March 26, 2008. In early May, he signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. He became a free agent at the end of the season. In 2009 Carrasco played in the Atlantic League for the Newark Bears, the Long Island Ducks and the Bridgeport Bluefish. Carrasco played with the Shreveport-Bossier Captains of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball during the 2010 season. He played for the club in 2011 as well.

A Republican, he served as the 35th Governor of Pennsylvania from 1951 to 1955. Early life Fine was born in Newport Township, Pennsylvania, one of nine children of Jacob W. and Margaret (n√©e Croop) Fine. In 1895, the family moved to nearby Nanticoke, where Fine received his early education at local public schools. He milked cows and plowed fields on a coal company farm as a young boy, and he later reported on local community news for the Wilkes-Barre Record as a teenager. After graduating from Nanticoke High School as valedictorian in 1911, Fine studied at the Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle, earning his law degree in 1914. He was admitted to practice law in Luzerne County (1914) and before the Superior Court of Pennsylvania (1915). He opened his own practice in Wilkes-Barre. From 1916 to 1920, he served as Republican chairman of the Fourth Legislative District of Luzerne County. Military career During World War I, Fine served with the 23rd US Army Engineers, reaching the rank of sergeant. In 1919, while he was stationed in Ireland, he took postgraduate studies at Trinity College of the University of Dublin. After his military service, he resumed his law practice and became a partner in the law firm Coughlin and Fine.  Political career  He served as secretary of the Republican County Committee from 1920 to 1922 and as chairman of the Luzerne County Republican Committee from 1922 to 1923. On January 3, 1927, Governor Gifford Pinchot appointed Fine to fill a vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County. He was elected to a regular ten-year term in November of that year and was re-elected to another term in 1939. He served as a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention. In 1939, he married Helene Pennebecker Morgan and he remained married to her until her death in 1950; the couple had two sons. In 1942, Fine was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Governor James H. Duff appointed him to fill a vacancy on the Pennsylvania Superior Court on July 15, 1947. He was elected to a permanent term in November 1947, serving in that position until he resigned in 1950 to campaign for governor. In 1950, after Duff decided to run for the US Senate, Fine was elected the 35th Governor of Pennsylvania. In the Republican primary, Fine, the favored candidate of Duff, defeated Philadelphia millionaire Jay Cooke, the favored candidate of the conservative machine of Joseph R. Grundy. In the general election, he narrowly defeated Democrat Richardson Dilworth, who would later become the mayor of Philadelphia, by 86,000 votes. Fine was the first Pennsylvania governor to have his inauguration televised. In 1962, Fine was indicted for evading payment of $45,000 in taxes. The Newport Excavation Co. allegedly paid for improvements on his farm along with salaries to two of his farm hands considered taxable income. The case was pretty solid, but Fine claimed ignorance to these issues and the Governor of Pennsylvania. , David L. Lawrence, testified as a character witness in Federal Court in behalf of ex- Gov Fine. As a result he was found not guilty.

Although her personal view of homosexuality was unambiguously negative, considering it immoral and disgusting, Rand endorsed non-discrimination protection for homosexuals in the public sphere while opposing laws against discrimination in the private sector on the basis of economic freedom. Ayn Rand =Moral views= In The Virtue of Selfishness published in 1964, Nathaniel Branden wrote in \\"Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice\\", about the conflict between the moral and the practical: \\"[What of] the adolescent who flees into homosexuality because he has been taught that sex is evil and that women are to be worshiped, but not desired?\\"The Virtue of Selfishness, \\"Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice\\". In 1971, Rand published an essay called \\"The Age of Envy\\", which included criticism of the women's liberation movement. Rand's criticisms included denouncing \\"sex views\\" that she considered \\"hideous\\", including \\"proclaim[ing] spiritual sisterhood with lesbians\\". Later that year Rand published another essay that criticized women's liberation for forming a \\"common front with lesbians and prostitutes\\". These two passages were Rand's only published writings about homosexuality. In response to questions from the audience at the two Ford Hall Forum lectures she gave at Northeastern University, Rand explained her views in more detail. In her 1968 lecture, she said, \\"I do not approve of such practices or regard them as necessarily moral, but it is improper for the law to interfere with a relationship between consenting adults.\\"Ayn Rand Answers, p. 18 Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff stated that there were people with whom Rand was \\"close, knowing full well that they were homosexual\\" and that \\"she certainly regarded some of them as Objectivists\\".http://www.peikoff.com/2009/05/25/is-homosexuality-immoral/ =Political views= Rand endorsed rights that protect homosexual people from discrimination by the government (such as opposition to sodomy laws), but rejected the right to be protected from discrimination in the private sector (such as employment discrimination).Atlassociety.orgTheobjectivestandard.comCapitalismmagazine.com The stated basis of this conclusion was that it was a product of her stand on property rights, not related to her feelings about homosexuality. Rand supported the right of a private property owner to discriminate, even on a basis that she condemned as immoral, such as racism, and that any act of the government to change this would be an intrusion on individual rights. =On sex roles= Rand asserted that \\"the essence of femininity is hero worship ‚Äì the desire to look up to man\\" and that \\"an ideal woman is a man-worshipper, and an ideal man is the highest symbol of mankind.\\" In other words, Rand felt that it was part of human nature for a psychologically healthy woman to want to be ruled in sexual matters by a man worthy of ruling her. In an authorized article in The Objectivist, psychotherapist Nathaniel Branden, Rand's onetime extramarital lover and \\"intellectual heir,\\" explains Rand's view as the idea that \\"man experiences the essence of his masculinity in the act of romantic dominance; woman experiences the essence of her femininity in the act of romantic surrender.\\" This however, would be very different than any brutal form of rule.The Psychology of Self-Esteem, Nathaniel Branden, 1969 After Rand's death After Rand's death in 1982, her heir, Leonard Peikoff, publicly disagreed with some of her views. Peikoff argued that homosexuality itself is not open to moral judgment. Other contemporary Objectivists generally continue to support the view that, while government should not discriminate for or against homosexuals in any way, private individuals and private organizations should be free to do so. In 1983, Branden wrote that Rand was \\"absolutely and totally ignorant‚Äù about homosexuality. Branden added that he saw her perspective \\"as calamitous, as wrong, as reckless, as irresponsible, and as cruel, and as one which I know has hurt too many people who ... looked up to her and assumed that if she would make that strong a statement she must have awfully good reasons.\\"\\"Ayn Rand and Homosexuality\\" Paul Varnell, Chicago Free Press, reprinted According to an FAQ from The Atlas Society (formerly The Objectivist Center): > While many conservatives believe that homosexuality should be outlawed and > many liberals believe that homosexuals should be given special rights, > Objectivism holds that as long as no force is involved, people have the > right to do as they please in sexual matters, whether or not their behavior > is considered by others to be or is in fact moral. And since individual > rights are grounded in the nature of human beings as human beings, > homosexuals do not deserve any more or less rights than heterosexuals. Objectivist psychotherapist Michael J. Hurd supports gay marriage as falling under the rights of individuals to associate voluntarily. Unlike Rand, however, he does not view homosexuality as immoral, stating that \\"a gay marriage... though unconventional and highly controversial, can be a loving and highly satisfying union between two individuals.\\" Objectivist psychologists Ellen Kenner and Edwin Locke expressed opinions similar to those of Hurd.Dr. Kenner on Romance Chartered affiliates of the Objectivist Party, a minor political party in the United States, adopted platforms opposing government-sanctioned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, favoring legalization of same-sex marriage, and favoring elimination of the military's policy of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\".Affiliate Platforms See also * Libertarian perspectives on LGBT rights References External links * Ayn Rand and Homosexuality, Chicago Free Press article by Paul Varnell * * \\"The Female Hero: A Randian-Feminist Synthesis\\", Thomas Gramstad (1999) Folk.uio.no Category:LGBT rights Category:Objectivism (Ayn Rand) Category:Homosexuality ","title":"Objectivism and homosexuality"},{"id":"3381857","title":"Grim &amp; Evil"},{"id":"3381865","text":"Michael J.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), was a landmark case in which the United States Supreme Court set forth the legal test for determining whether to grant deference to a government agency's interpretation of a statute which it administers. The decision articulated a doctrine now known as \\"Chevron deference\\".United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226 (2001). The doctrine consists of a two-part test applied by the court, when appropriate, that is highly deferential to government agencies: \\"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction [emphasis added] of the statute\\", so long as Congress has not spoken directly to the precise issue at question. The decision involved a lawsuit challenging the U.S. government's interpretation of the word \\"source\\" in an environmental statute. In 1977, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that amended the Clean Air Act of 1963the United States's comprehensive law regulating air pollution. The bill changed the law so that all companies in the United States that planned to build or install any major source of air pollutants were required to go through an elaborate \\"new-source review\\" process before they could proceed. The bill did not precisely define what constituted a \\"source\\" of air pollutants, and so the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formulated a definition as part of implementing the changes to the law. The EPA's initial definition of a \\"source\\" of air pollutants covered essentially any significant change or addition to a plant or factory, but in 1981 it changed its definition to be simply a plant or factory in its entirety. This allowed companies to avoid the \\"new-source review\\" process entirely if, when increasing their plant's emissions through building or modifying, they simultaneously modified other parts of their plant to reduce emissions so that the overall change in the plant's emissions was zero. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an American non-profit environmental advocacy organization, then filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the EPA's new definition. Chevron is one of the most important decisions in U.S. administrative law, and has been cited in thousands of cases since being issued in 1984. Background Under the Supreme Court's ruling in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), United States federal courts have the authority to judicially review the statutes enacted by Congress, and declare a statute invalid if it violates the Constitution. But the Constitution sets no express limits on how much federal authority can be delegated to a government agency. Rather, limits on the authority granted to a federal agency occur within the statutes enacted by Congress. It is also worth noting that federal courts are constitutionally of \\"limited jurisdiction\\". Congress bestowed on them the authority to adjudicate administrative matters in 1948. [28 USC sec. 1331 (1948)] In 1974 the Supreme Court stated that deference depends on an administrative interpretation being consistent with the agency's other statements and being consistent with the congressional purpose: Facts Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to address states that had failed to attain the air quality standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Defendant). \\"The amended Clean Air Act required these 'non-attainment' States to establish a permit program regulating 'new or modified major stationary sources' of air pollution.\\"467 U.S. at 840. During the Carter administration, the EPA defined a source as any device in a manufacturing plant that produced pollution. In 1981, after Ronald Reagan's election, the EPA, which was headed by Anne M. Gorsuch, adopted a new definition that allowed an existing plant to get permits for new equipment that did not meet standards as long as the total emissions from the plant itself did not increase. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental protection group, challenged the EPA regulation in federal court, which ruled in the NRDC's favor. NRDC v. Gorsuch, 685 F.2d 718. Chevron, an affected party, appealed the lower court's decision. Issue The issue facing the Court was what standard of review should be applied by a court to a government agency's own reading of a statute that it is charged with administering. Holding The Court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, upheld the EPA's interpretation. A two-part analysis was born from the Chevron decision (called the \\"Chevron two-step test\\"), where a reviewing court determines: Importance Chevron is probably the most frequently cited case in American administrative law, but some scholars suggest that the decision has had little impact on the Supreme Court's jurisprudence and merely clarified the Court's existing approach.Thomas W. Merrill, \\"Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent\\", 101 Yale L.J. 969, 982‚Äì985 (1992) The ruling that the judiciary should defer to a federal agency's interpretation of ambiguous language from Congressional legislation relevant to the agency is often referred to as the Chevron deference. Chevron, 18 years later, was able to invoke Chevron deference to win another case, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Echazabal, , before the Supreme Court. In a unanimous decision, the Court applied Chevron deference and upheld as reasonable an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulation, which allowed an employer to refuse to hire an applicant when the applicant's disability on the job would pose a \\"direct threat\\" to the applicant's own health. Three 21st-century decisions of the Supreme Court may limit the scope of administrative agency actions that receive Chevron deference to agency decisions that have the \\"force of law\\".See Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002); United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001); Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000). This new doctrine is sometimes referred to as \\"Chevron step zero\\".See, for example, Cass R. Sunstein, \\"Chevron Step Zero\\", 92 Va. L. Rev. 187 (2006). Thus, for example, a regulation promulgated under the \\"notice and comment\\" provisions of ¬ß 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act would be likely to receive Chevron deference, but a letter sent by an agency, such as a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\"no-action\\" letter, would not.See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (1999) (no Chevron deference to opinion letter sent by NLRB about interpretation of overtime laws) However, an agency action that does not receive Chevron deference may still receive some degree of deference under the old standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944).See Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002) (stating explicitly that Skidmore still applies to agency actions that do not receive Chevron deference) The majority in Christensen v. Harris County (2000) suggested that Chevron deference should apply to formal agency documents which have the force of law while Skidmore should apply to less formal agency documents in an attempt to draw a bright line for the question of \\"force of law\\" under Chevron step zero. In King v. Burwell (2015), the Supreme Court has suggested that Chevron deference may be inappropriate in regulatory actions of \\"deep economic and political significance\\",King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks deleted) hinting at the possibility of substantially limiting, or even eliminating, the doctrine.See Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1). Opposition = Federal = The United States House of Representatives in the 115th Congress passed a bill on January 11, 2017, called the \\"Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017\\", which, if made into law, would change the doctrine of Chevron deference. According to Charles Murray in By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission, > Chevron deference augments that characteristic of prerogative power by > giving regulatory bureaucrats a pass available to no private citizen and to > no other government officials ‚Äî including the president and cabinet officers > ‚Äî who function outside the regulatory state. For everyone except officials > of the regulatory state, judges do not defer to anything except the text of > the law in question and the body of case law accompanying it. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch (son of Anne Gorsuch, who was head of EPA at the time of the events which led to the Chevron decision) has also written opinions against Chevron deference, with news commentators believing that Gorsuch may rule against Chevron deference on the Supreme Court. In the U.S. Supreme Court case City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, the dissent by Chief Justice Roberts joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito objected to excessive Chevron deference to agencies: > My disagreement with the Court is fundamental. It is also easily expressed: > A court should not defer to an agency until the court decides, on its own, > that the agency is entitled to deference. In Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural > Resources Defense Council Inc., we established a test for reviewing \\"an > agency's construction of the statute which it administers.\\" 467 U.S. 837, > 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). If Congress has \\"directly spoken > to the precise question at issue,\\" we said, \\"that is the end of the matter.\\" > Ibid. A contrary agency interpretation must give way. \\"It is emphatically > the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\\" > Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). The rise of the > modern administrative state has not changed that duty. Indeed, the > Administrative Procedure Act, governing judicial review of most agency > action, instructs reviewing courts to decide \\"all relevant questions of > law.\\" 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 706. Likewise before joining the U.S. Supreme Court, 10th Circuit Judge Gorsuch in his concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch also objected to excessive Chevron deference to agencies: > Quite literally then, after this court declared the statutes' meaning and > issued a final decision, an executive agency was permitted to (and did) tell > us to reverse our decision like some sort of super court of appeals. If that > doesn't qualify as an unconstitutional revision of a judicial declaration of > the law by a political branch, I confess I begin to wonder whether we've > forgotten what might. In the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Congress > vested the courts with the power to \\"interpret ... statutory provisions\\" and > overturn agency action inconsistent with those interpretations. 5 U.S.C. ¬ß > 706. For whatever the agency may be doing under Chevron, the problem remains > that courts are not fulfilling their duty to interpret the law and declare > invalid agency actions inconsistent with those interpretations in the cases > and controversies that come before them. A duty expressly assigned to them > by the APA and one often likely compelled by the Constitution itself. That's > a problem for the judiciary. And it is a problem for the people whose > liberties may now be impaired not by an independent decisionmaker seeking to > declare the law's meaning as fairly as possible ‚Äî the decisionmaker promised > to them by law ‚Äî but by an avowedly politicized administrative agent seeking > to pursue whatever policy whim may rule the day. Subsequently, in Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA the court did not defer to the agency's interpretation. =State= At the state level, Arizona has statutorily overturned Chevron deference with respect to most of its own agencies. In April 2018, the state's governor Doug Ducey signed HB 2238 into law, which states in relevant part, > In a proceeding brought by or against the regulated party, the court shall > decide all questions of law, including the interpretation of a > constitutional or statutory provision or a rule adopted by an agency, > without deference to any previous determination that may have been made on > the question by the agency. The bill explicitly exempts health care appeals and actions of agencies created by the state's Corporation Commission.

Following In Trousers and March of the Falsettos, it is the third in a trio of one-act musicals centering on Marvin, his wife Trina, his psychiatrist Mendel, his son Jason, and his gay lover Whizzer Brown. In this chapter of Marvin's life, Jason is preparing for his bar mitzvah and Whizzer is suffering from a mysterious, life-threatening, as yet undefined illness, which the audience recognizes is AIDS. It forms the second act of the 1990 Broadway musical Falsettos, with March of the Falsettos as the first act. Productions Falsettoland opened Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on June 28, 1990 and closed on August 12, 1990.Falsettoland playwrightshorizons.org, accessed May 23, 2015 The musical transferred to the Lucille Lortel Theatre on September 25, 1990 and closed on January 27, 1991 after 176 performances. Directed by Lapine, the cast included Michael Rupert (Marvin), Faith Prince (Trina), Stephen Bogardus (Whizzer), Chip Zien (later replaced by Lonny Price) (Mendel), Heather MacRae (Dr. Charlotte) and Janet Metz (Cordelia).Review/Theater; 'Falsettoland,' a William Finn Sequel, Reopens\\"The New York Times, September 17, 1990' Falsettoland Lortel Theatre\\" lortel.org, accessed May 23, 2015 A cast recording was released by DRG Records.Falsettoland allmusic.com, accessed May 23, 2015 Synopsis The year is 1981. Mendel the psychiatrist shines a flashlight into the audience on a dark stage, welcoming us to \\"Falsettoland,\\" the conclusion to March of the Falsettos. The cast has been enlarged by two, Marvin's lesbian neighbors Dr. Charlotte, an internist, and Cordelia, a ‚Äûshiksa\\" caterer. Marvin has realized that it's \\"About Time\\" that he grows up and gets over himself. He has called a truce with Trina and he has managed to maintain his relationship with Jason, who is 1now preparing for his Bar Mitzvah. He has not seen Whizzer for two years and has still not gotten over him. One day, when she arrives to take custody of Jason for the week, Trina informs Marvin that it is now time to start planning Jason's Bar Mitzvah, probably the last pleasant thing the ex- couple will ever do together. The pair immediately starts bickering, to Jason's dismay and Mendel's amusement. Mendel encourages them to have a simple party, but Trina (and Cordelia, the caterer) will have none of it. It is the \\"Year of the Child\\" after all, the year that every Jewish parent dreams of: the year their child is bar mitzvahed and they can spend insane amounts of money celebrating. The scene moves to Jason's Little League Baseball game. While at bat, Jason has a lot more on his mind than the game. He is trying to decide which girls to invite to his bar mitzvah: the girls he should invite, or the girls he \\"wants\\" to invite; reaching a discussion in this delicate situation would be a \\"Miracle of Judaism.\\" Everyone is sitting \\"watching Jewish boys who can't play baseball play baseball\\" and getting a little too into it, when Whizzer suddenly arrives: Jason had asked him to come (\\"The Baseball Game\\"). Marvin is struck by how little he's aged, and a tentative offer of reconciliation is offered just as Jason, miracle of miracles (and thanks to some helpful batting advice from Whizzer), actually hits the ball. He's so shocked he forgets to run. An interlude: \\"A Day in Falsettoland.\\" In Part One, \\"Dr. Mendel at Work,\\" Mendel listens to the blather of a yuppie patient and agonizes over being a 1960s shrink stuck in the 1980s, and how his work is taking a toll on his marriage to Trina. In Part Two, \\"Trina Works It Out,\\" Trina reveals Marvin and Whizzer are back and wonders why that is bothering her. In Part Three, \\"The Neighbors Relax,\\" Mendel and Trina jog and discuss Marvin and the bar mitzvah, and Dr. Charlotte comes home to Cordelia cooking \\"nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine.\\" Cordelia asks Charlotte how her day was at the hospital, and Charlotte exclaims that today was a rare day without a death. Meanwhile, Marvin and Whizzer play racquetball and bicker when Whizzer beats Marvin soundly. All reflect on how wonderful life is. The peace doesn't last long. Marvin and Trina are warring over every single aspect of the bar mitzvah, which makes Jason want to just call the whole thing off (\\"Round Tables, Square Tables\\"). It is up to Mendel to console the boy, telling him that \\"Everyone Hates His Parents\\" at his age, but everyone also gets past it and moves on to hate them less. Marvin sits in bed one morning, looking at the sleeping Whizzer, wondering at how much he loves him (\\"What More Can I Say?\\"). Dr. Charlotte, meanwhile, has started to become aware that \\"Something Bad is Happening\\" among young gay men in the city, who arrive at the hospital sick with a mysterious illness that no one seems to know anything about. Rumors are spreading, but the disease is spreading faster. Then Whizzer collapses during a game of racquetball (\\"More Racquetball\\"). As Whizzer enters the hospital with a disease that the audience immediately knows to be AIDS, Trina begins to see her world fall apart around her as someone she shouldn't care about but does anyway is clearly sick. She is barely \\"Holding to the Ground\\" and this blow to her family may just be too hard to handle. In Whizzer's hospital room, the entire cast gathers to cheer him up, everyone commenting on how good he looks. Marvin provides love, Cordelia chicken soup and Mendel some terrible jokes. Everyone agrees that it's \\"Days Like This\\" that make these secular Jews believe in God. Only Jason, in childish honesty, is able to tell Whizzer the truth: that he looks awful. Mendel and Trina sit Jason down and give Jason the option of \\"Canceling the Bar Mitzvah\\" if he feels he can't go through with it, and Jason is finally told that Whizzer may not recover. Marvin sits in Whizzer's hospital room, soon joined by the Lesbians, and the four \\"Unlikely Lovers\\" wonder how much longer their love can last. As Whizzer's condition worsens, Jason turns to God, asking him to let Whizzer get better (\\"Another Miracle of Judaism\\"); he'll even get bar mitzvahed if Whizzer gets better. But it's to no avail, because, as Dr. Charlotte reiterates, \\"Something Bad is Happening\\" to Whizzer (\\"Something Bad Is Happening (reprise)\\"). He is soon deathly ill, and he steels himself to meet his maker, reflecting bravely that \\"You Gotta Die Sometime.\\" Suddenly everyone bursts into the hospital room. Jason has had an epiphany: he wants to hold his bar mitzvah in Whizzer's hospital room so he can be there (\\"Jason's Bar Mitzvah\\"). Trina couldn't be prouder, and everyone, for some reason, can only think how much Jason looks like Marvin. Jason is bar mitzvahed, entering Adulthood as Whizzer begins to leave his, for Whizzer can suddenly take no more, and is taken out of the room. Marvin is left alone. He sits and reflects on his relationship with Whizzer (\\"What Would I Do?\\"). Whizzer appears, dressed as we first saw him, and the two sing together one last time, and then Whizzer is gone. Marvin is comforted by his family, now short a member, as Mendel bids us goodnight from the crazy, sad world known as \\"Falsettoland.\\" Song list *Falsettoland *About Time *Year of the Child *Miracle of Judaism *Watching Jason (Baseball) *A Day in Falsettoland *Racquetball *The Argument(renamed and reworked from \\"Round Tables, Square Tables\\") *Everyone Hates His Parents *What More Can I Say *Something Bad is Happening *Racquetball 2 *Holding to the Ground *Days Like This *Canceling the Bar Mitzvah *Unlikely Lovers *Another Miracle of Judaism *You Gotta Die Sometime *Jason's Bar Mitzvah *What Would I Do?

He has spent over 40 years hosting radio shows, mostly for the BBC, in particular Radio Leeds. He has been regularly accompanied throughout his career by comedy sidekick Edouard Lapaglie. Education and early career Kelner studied Arts and Social Studies at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, but dropped out. He was employed as a reporter on the Western Daily Press in Bristol and for the Oxford Mail. He then joined the Central Office of Information, for whom he worked in Bristol, Lambeth, South London and in Birmingham. Martin Kelner moved to Radio Hallam in Sheffield to begin his career in radio. He started reading the breakfast show news before moving on to his own late night show. He spent a brief spell at London's LBC and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, before moving to Leeds in 1981 and the fledgling Radio Aire. He left Radio Aire in late 1982, and worked for Yorkshire TV for a time on a programme called Calendar It's The Weekend. He was also a co-presenter on BBC Breakfast. Other television excursions for Kelner include Brainwave, a daytime quiz show and Pick of the Week. Radio In 1984 Kelner joined the BBC. He initially presented the weekday early show on BBC Radio 2 in September and October 1984, and then presented his own Saturday night show on the same station from 6 July 1985 until 24 March 1990, also returning to the early show for two stints during 1985. He fronted his own Saturday afternoon show on Radio 2 from 1 October 1994 to 23 March 1996. He also did many stand-ins for regular presenters on the network, peaking in the mid-1990s when he regularly deputised for Sarah Kennedy on the weekday early show (both when she sat in for Terry Wogan and when she was on holiday herself) and also sat in for Ken Bruce and John Dunn. He also presented editions of the Radio 2 Arts Programme from the north of England, and a programme called Let It Be... Please! featuring bad or embarrassing cover versions of the Beatles' songs. He then fell out of favour at the national station, presenting his last Radio 2 show sitting in for Sarah Kennedy on 29 November 1996. At the same time as he was on Radio 2, he was also presenting a local radio late-night show from the Radio Leeds studios and broadcast across the BBC Night Network in the north, on which he first gave airtime to radio comedy sketches from Caroline Aherne. She portrayed the Mrs Merton character on his radio show ad-libbing conversations with Kelner for around eight years. He also introduced Aherne into network broadcasting on Radio 2 and the original BBC Radio 5, where he presented the programme Five Aside for the station's opening months in 1990. He returned to Manchester to present the breakfast show on 100.4 Jazz FM, where he introduced another great comic talent to the public in the shape of Jake Yapp's Dora Dale, with whom Martin produced the hit BBC Radio 7 comedy show, Pleased To Meet You. This show was nominated for a Sony National Radio Award on 28 March 2007 in the category of Best Comedy Programme. Until October 2006, Kelner presented the Friday and Saturday late show at the weekends on BBC Radio Humberside, BBC Radio York, BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Sheffield. Other stations he has worked for include BBC Thames Valley FM, BBC Radio Cleveland, Pennine Radio, BBC Radio 5 Live, TalkSport, BBC Radio Manchester, Real Radio Yorkshire and Mansfield 103.2 FM. From 2006 until 2010 he presented his own podcast, the Piss Poor Podcast, accompanied for the most part by Edouard Lapaglie. He also appears on BBC Radio 5 Live as a regular panellist on Fighting Talk (twice finishing as series runner up and twice winning the series championship, in 2013 and 2019), and has contributed to Chart The Week on Richard Bacon's programme. His most regular radio slot had been the BBC Radio Leeds Breakfast Show which he co-presented Monday to Thursday from 6:30am to 9:00am, but he was moved to the lunchtime slot in November 2012. Due to a change in direction of the station, Kelner left Radio Leeds again, presenting his last show on 18 March 2016.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2016/03/martin-kelner-exits-bbc-radio-leeds- again/ On 2 February 2018, Kelner joined the DAB station TalkRadio, hosting weekend mornings from 1am to 5am. Writing and journalism Kelner's journalism includes a weekly column for The Guardian, \\"Screen Break\\", which took a lighthearted look at the world of sport on TV, and a fortnightly column about radio. \\"Screen Break\\" finished on 31 December 2012. He writes occasional travel pieces for The Mail on Sunday, and has written for The Independent, of which his brother Simon Kelner was executive editor. Kelner began writing for the Racing Post at the beginning of 2013. Other publications he has written for include GQ, Men's Health, Later (now defunct), RCME, The Observer, Landrover Owner magazine, You magazine, and Public Servant, the local and national government journal. He also has contributed to the YouGov website, and wrote television previews for the Daily Mail around 1994/95. He has posted humorous product reviews on Amazon. His first book, about the outer suburbs of show business, was called When Will I Be Famous?. His second book, Sit Down and Cheer, looked at the history of sport on British television. Health problems in the summer of 2013, Kelner was diagnosed with fibromatosis; he later had surgery to remove a sarcoma from his abdomen and was cared for at St James Hospital, Leeds. He was later treated at the hospital's intensive treatment unit for a week, and returned to his home in Wakefield for further recovery. In his blog, Kelner noted that it would be early 2014 until he could fully \\"return to professional life\\". He resumed his column in The Racing Post (at first on a semi-regular basis) and BBC Radio 5 Live later announced his return to Fighting Talk on 2 November. By mid-January he had resumed his lunchtime programme on BBC Radio Leeds.

He was the immediate predecessor in this role to Timur, who later founded the Timurid Empire. Background Hajji Beg was a member of the Barlas tribe and claimed descent from Qarachar Noyan, one of the Mongol nobles assigned by Genghis Khan to his son Chagatai. Hajji Beg and Timur shared a common ancestor in Qarachar, though they descended from different sons. Life Hajji Beg is first mentioned in 1358 or 1359, when he participated in the overthrow of the Qara'unas ‚ÄòAbdullah, who was effectively in control of the southern Chagatai Khanate. 'Abd Allah, who had recently taken power, was young and inexperienced, and his move to Samarkand threatened Hajji Beg, whose territories were centered in the nearby city of Kish. Together with another tribal leader named Buyan Suldus, Hajji Beg removed him from power and killed his puppet khan Shah Temur. Buyan Suldus was then raised to 'Abd Allah's former position of amir. Buyan Suldus' refusal to enforce his authority, as well as a continuing state of chaos within the Chagatai ulus, led to the Khan of Moghulistan, Tughlugh Timur, to invade in 1360. Most of the Chagatai leaders did not oppose the invasion; many of them took the opportunity to pillage each other's lands. The Yasa'ur Hajji Mahmudshah, whose tribe bordered the Barlas, decided to raid their territory with a Moghul army. Hajji Beg decided at first to resist, but seeing that the Moghuls were much stronger, he fled to Khorasan. During his retreat, Hajji Beg was accompanied by a member of a prominent Barlas family, Timur. When they reached the Oxus River, Timur asked to return to Kish so that he could maintain order within the Barlas region. Timur's prominent standings within the Barlas and with several members of the Moghul elite, however, resulted in Tughlugh Temur's appointing him as the ruler of the Barlas region. Timur then aligned himself with tribal leaders that were hostile to Hajji Beg, eventually throwing his support behind Amir Husayn, a nephew of 'Abd Allah and the current leader of the Qara'unas. In the meantime, the Moghuls abandoned the region and headed back to Moghulistan. Soon afterwards, Hajji Beg returned to the Chagatai ulus in an effort to regain control of the Barlas. He went to the ruler of the Jalayir, Bayazid, and together they attacked the Yasa'uri. When Timur heard of this, he moved his army in support of the Yasa'uri. The two sides met in battle, and while its outcome is disagreed upon, it caused the Barlas emirs as well as the army to defect back to Hajji Beg. As a result, Timur was constrained to submit to Hajji Beg. The Barlas and Jalayir then again attacked the Yasa'uri and defeated them; this victory secured Hajji Beg's position as leader of his tribe. In the spring of 1361 Tughlugh Timur again invaded the ulus. Knowing that both Bayazid Jalayir and Buyan Suldus had decided to pledge their allegiance to the khan, Hajji Beg planned to do so as well. Tughlugh Timur's execution of Bayazid, however, prompted him to change his mind. He went to Kish to gather troops, and then crossed the Oxus into Khorasan, but there he was killed by a group of Turks. Tughlugh Timur then gave Timur command of Kish a second time, but he would lose it soon afterwards. References *Manz, Beatrice Forbes, The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane.

This children's book chronicles the adventures of Ramona's first few months at kindergarten. The book's title is derived from the characterization of Ramona as a \\"pest\\" by many, including her older sister Beatrice, known as \\"Beezus.\\" Ramona the Pest was first published in 1968 and featured illustrations by Louis Darling. Other illustrators have since updated Ramona the Pest, including Alan Tiegreen, Tracy Dockray, and Jacqueline Rogers. Plot summary Ramona Quimby is excited because she is starting kindergarten. She is a year older than in Beezus and Ramona and trouble still seems to follow her. Although Ramona does not mean to be a pest, she still manages to create trouble without trying to. Miss Binney is her teacher, and Ramona likes her a lot, especially when she praises Ramona's interesting drawing and nice fat letter 'Q's. There's a girl in her class named Susan with long, springy curls. Ramona really wants to pull on one of those curls and watch it bounce back and forth, but when she finally does she gets sent to the bench until recess is over. Another new person in her class is Davy. Ramona chases him at recess, trying to catch and kiss him, which she finally manages to accomplish when she participates in the Halloween parade when she is \\"the baddest witch in the world.\\" Ramona tries to do her best in kindergarten but it isn't easy, especially during seat work, when she has to sit quietly and keep her eyes on her own work. She's just too interested in seeing what everyone else is doing. Still, kindergarten is going well until the day the substitute teacher arrives. Ramona won't go to class without Miss Binney, so she hides behind the trash cans with Ribsy the dog. When Beezus finds her and takes her to the principal's office Ramona is forced to go to class anyway. Then one day, Susan calls Ramona a \\"pest\\", Ramona retaliates by pulling Susan's curls, and Miss Binney sends her home until she can behave.

Tokai is one of Japan's leading companies in the business. The company was founded in 1947 by Tadayouki Adachi and remains family-owned. Although Tokai currently focuses on electric and acoustic guitars, basses and autoharps (called \\"chromaharp\\")Chromaharp on Tokai Japan, 27 Oct 2019, the company manufactured other instruments such as melodicas, pianos and guitar amplifiers in the past.  History  Tokai began in 1947, as a harmonica and piano manufacturer. It developed its first melodica, the Pianica, in 1961. Tokai began making banjos and harpsichords in 1973 and the electric piano in 1975. Tokai started making classical guitars in 1965. It made its first electric guitar in 1968 with the Humming Bird, a guitar loosely based on the Mosrite Mark I and II. This was followed in 1970 with the Humming Bird Custom acoustic guitar (not to be confused with the Hummingbird guitar model produced by Gibson). From 1970 to 1973, Tokai produced the Conn line of acoustic guitars under contract with C.G. ConnConn acoustic guitars unofficial website on The Jet Medic (archived, 13 Jul 2011)Conn acoustic (steel-string) guitars on The Guitar Medic (archived, 19 Jan 2018) In 1972, Tokai entered into a joint-venture with C. F. Martin & Company to supply acoustic guitar parts and also to build Martin's Sigma electric guitars. In 1975, it launched its own Cat's Eyes line of acoustic guitars, which were replicas of C.F. Martin guitars. Between 1977 and 1978, Tokai began making various Fender and Gibson replica electric guitars and basses. These models are generically known as \\"lawsuit guitars\\". Tokai's replica of the Gibson Les Paul electric guitar, named the \\"Les Paul Reborn\\" model, started in 1978. By 1980, the name was changed to \\"Reborn Old\\" and later to its current name, \\"Love Rock\\". The name change was in response to threats from American guitar companies to go to court to protect their copyrights. Tokai also made Fender replicas, the \\"Springy Sound\\" (ST series, Fender Stratocaster replica) and the \\"Breezy Sound\\" (TE series, Fender Telecaster replica).Both Stevie Ray Vaughan and Chuck Hammer played a \\"Tokai Springy Sound\\" at one time. This guitar was fitted with lipstick pickups and can be seen on the cover of his second studio album Couldn't Stand the Weather. By the late 1970s, replicas of Fender guitars, such as the \\".38 Special\\" guitar and the \\"Hard Puncher\\" bass (replica of the Fender Precision Bass), began to be sold in Japan and Europe.Q&A;'s with Mr. Shohei Adachi, president of Tokai Gakki on Tokai forum, Oct 30, 2005 In 1983, Tokai introduced an aluminum-body guitar called the Talbo (Tokai Aluminum Body) which the band Devo played at one time. Tokai has its own instrument making factory and have built guitars for well-known brands under contract (OEM). Tokai and Dyna Gakki produced the Fender Japan solid-body models from 1997 until the end of the Fender Japan joint-venture in 2015.  Characteristics  The original selling price in Japanese yen is often included in the model number‚Äîfor example TLS-100 = 100,000 Japanese yen. The higher priced Tokai Gibson replicas have nitrocellulose finishes and long tenon neck joints. Tokai guitars have been made in Japan, Korea and China. Korean production started around the mid-1990s. Tokai guitars made in Korea (MIK) are lower priced guitars, similar to the Korean Epiphone guitars. The MIK (Made in Korea) guitars can be differentiated by the truss rod cover. Japanese guitars have a two-screw truss rod cover whereas the Korean guitars have a three-screw truss rod cover (although some early Korean guitars also have two-screw truss rod covers). The MIK guitars usually have a different Nashville style bridge instead of the usual ABR-1 bridge. Furthermore, MIK Gibson replica guitars usually have a neck made from maple, and the body wood is usually made from either alder, agathis or nato.  Serial numbers  Tokai uses a seven-digit serial number usually pressed into the back of the headstock for the Gibson model replicas. Love Rocks use the first digit of the serial number for the year, 10XXXXX=1981 and starting in 1989 Love Rocks use the first two digits for the year, 89XXXXX=1989. Reborn models use only the first digit for the year, 800XXXX = 1978. There is a major exception to this in that some \\"Reborn Olds\\" (very rare) and \\"Love Rock\\" models have inked serial numbers on the reverse of the headstock (often referred to as \\"Inkies\\"). These guitars are, it is generally agreed, from 1980 (00xxxxx and 01xxxxx) and 1981 (11xxxxx) although there are those who would disagree with this. It also appears that some of the original 1978 \\"Les Paul Reborns\\" have serial numbers. Some MIK Love Rock models have no serial number and simply have \\"Made In Korea\\" inked on the back of the headstock. Sometimes the model number may be located under the bridge pickup. MIK Love Rock models identified in this manner include ALS48 and ALS50Q. The Tokai Fender replicas have a production number serial number that contains no year information.

The small rocky tidal island is linked to the mainland by a short concrete causeway which is submerged at high tide.  History  The lighthouse and adjacent keepers' cottages were built in 1898 by the John Miller company of Tynemouth, using 645 blocks of stone and 750,000 bricks. It was built on the site of an 11th-century monastic chapel, whose monks maintained a lantern on the tower to warn passing ships of the danger of the rocks. A first-order 'bi-valve' rotating optic was installed by Barbier & B√©nard of Paris, very similar to the one they had provided the previous year for Lundy North Lighthouse;s:1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/Lighthouse it displayed a group-flashing characteristic, flashing twice every 20 seconds. The lamp was powered by paraffin, and was not electrified until 1977; St Mary's was by then the last Trinity House lighthouse lit by oil. As part of the electrification process the fine first- order fresnel lens was removed by Trinity House (it was later put on display in their National Lighthouse Museum in Penzance). Its place in the tower was taken by a four-tier revolving sealed beam lamp array, manufactured by Pharos Marine; it was powered by two 12-volt batteries, charged from the mains electricity supply.  Decommissioning  The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1984 (just two years after its conversion to automatic operation). The revolving sealed beam array was reused two years later (in reduced form) on the Inner Dowsing light platform in the North Sea, as part of its conversion to become 'the first major lighthouse to be run using solar power'. A few years later, St Mary's was opened as a visitor attraction by the local council. In place of the original optic, Trinity House offered a smaller one from their decommissioned lighthouse at Withernsea, and this can still be seen at the top of the tower.World Lighthouse Society Fall 2004 Newsletter Volume 2 Issue 3 Following closure of the Penzance lighthouse museum, the original lens was returned to St Mary's in 2011 to be put on display.  The lighthouse today  Since 2012 St Mary's lighthouse has been grade II listed. While it no longer functions as a working lighthouse, it is easily accessible (when the tide is out) and regularly open to visitors; in addition to the lighthouse itself there is a small museum, a visitor's centre, and a caf√©. The cottage was upgraded with a wood pellet boiler in 2014. In 2017 a renovation plan for the site (including roof-top viewing platforms and various glass-covered extensions) was rejected by the local planning authority due to environmental concerns. A new refurbishment proposal (to include rebuilding the original optic) was presented in 2018; however the Heritage Lottery Fund later turned down North Tyneside Council's ¬£2.1m funding application. Another Victorian lighthouse may be found a few miles to the south of the River Tyne. Souter Lighthouse is also now decommissioned, and open to visitors. Souter Lighthouse can be seen with the naked eye from the top of St Mary's Lighthouse.Personal observation  See also  * List of lighthouses in England  References   External links  * Trinity House Category:Lighthouses completed in 1898 Category:Lighthouses in England Category:Buildings and structures in the Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside Category:Museums in Tyne and Wear Category:Lighthouse museums in England Category:Whitley Bay Category:Grade II listed lighthouses Category:Grade II listed buildings in Tyne and Wear ","title":"St Mary's Lighthouse"},{"id":"3381929","text":"Skin of a sand lizard, showing squamate reptiles iconic Scales A white-headed dwarf gecko with shed tail Reptiles are tetrapod animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives.

They are also used in Hispanic culture. These paper lanterns have to some extent replaced the older tradition of the vigil fire luminaria with which they became confused. Yet another form of luminaria, a small torch or large candle, is carried by the leader of the procession of Las Posadas, a nine-day holiday running December 16‚Äì24. Electrically-lit luminarias are also used, consisting of a string of standard incandescent \\"Christmas lights\\" with the bulbs covered with a tan plastic sleeve, made to about the size and shape of a small paper bag. Christmas tradition Las Noches de las Luminarias, at the Desert Botanical Garden, Phoenix Praiano, Italy, Luminaria di San Domenico, August 1. Luminarias are used in seasons other than Christmas. The early versions were actually small bonfires of crisscrossed pi√±on branches which were built in three-foot high squares. Today, luminarias are made from brown paper bags weighted down with sand and illuminated from within by a lit candle. These are typically arranged in rows to create large and elaborate displays. The hope among Roman Catholics is that the lights will guide the spirit of the Christ child to one's home. In recent times they are seen more as a secular decoration, akin to Christmas lights. Strings of artificial luminarias, with plastic bags illuminated by small light bulbs and connected by an electrical cord, are also available, and are common in the American Southwest, where they are typically displayed throughout the year-end holiday season. These are beginning to gain popularity in other parts of the United States. Santa Fe and Old Town Albuquerque, New Mexico, are well known for their impressive Christmas Eve farolito displays. Farolito displays are common throughout New Mexico, and most communities in New Mexico have farolitos in prominent areas such as major streets or parks. Residents often line their yards, fences, sidewalks, and roofs with farolitos. Similar traditions can now also be found in many other parts of the nation. New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico holds an annual event called Noche de Luminarias in early December, which features over 10,000 luminarias across campus. https://campusactivities.nmsu.edu/noche-de-luminarias/ San Juan College in Farmington, New Mexico, organizes a large annual farolito display, most recently consisting of around 30,000 farolitos displayed on campus. At historic Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah, metal luminarias decorate the grounds near the Church Office Building of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Tiny holes have been punched in the metal to create designs featuring scenes from the life of Jesus Christ and Christmas messages in a variety of languages. Some of the luminaries are the traditional bag shape, while others are large cans. They have been on display since before 2002, when even more were added. In West Valley City, Utah, luminarias are used to light the path during the Walk with Santa held the first Monday of December every year. The display features over 300 luminarias. The American Cancer Society's Relay For Life fundraising events which are held all over the U.S. feature luminaria ceremonies. Luminarias are placed around the track and some relay events spell out \\"HOPE\\" in stadium stands with luminarias. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention's Out of the Darkness Overnight uses luminarias at the end of the overnight walk to memorialize those lost to suicide for survivors. Luminarias have also become popular in California in some cities. The Boy Scout Troops and Albuquerque Youth Symphony sell them around Christmas time as another form of fundraising. On Evensham Street in the Glenshire Devonshire area of Truckee, California, local residents line the streets with luminaries. See Glenshire Devonshire's web page for aerial photos. The Mantey Heights neighborhood of Grand Junction, Colorado has celebrated the luminaria tradition for several decades. Over 3,500 luminaries are placed along the roads and walkways every Christmas Eve. Many are positioned atop the parapets of the old adobe homes. In Champaign, Illinois, luminarias line South Willis Ave. between Springfield Ave. and John St. for one night each holiday season. In Galena, Illinois, luminarias line the streets of the town one night in December for their annual \\"Night of Luminaria.\\" In Midlothian, Illinois, luminaria sets are sold to raise money for the local food pantries. About 75% of the food pantries annual budget comes from these luminaria sales and donations. After the 2008 city hall shooting in Kirkwood, Missouri, residents lined the streets with luminarias to honor the victims of the shooting. Each year for the past 22 years community members have placed luminarias along the path beside Lake Washington north of Seward Park. They place as many as 1800 along a three-mile stretch of the path. The placement of the luminaria are timed to coincide with the annual Christmas Ships festival organized by Argosy Cruises. Other holidays In some Southwestern states, such as Arizona and Texas as well as New Mexico, luminarias are also occasionally used as Halloween decorations, sometimes featuring jack o' lantern faces drawn on the paper bags.http://sumonova.com/luminarias-a-southwest-tradition-expanded/ Artificial luminarias are increasingly available with holiday themed decorative patterns and in colors other than brown. Naming disagreement The name of the decoration is the subject of a long-running item of contention among some New Mexicans. In general, farolito is the preferred term in northern New Mexico, while the decorations are often referred to as luminarias in the southern part of the state; The central part around Albuquerque is mixed, leaning toward \\"luminaria\\". In Spanish, the word farolito translates as \\"little lantern\\", while luminaria means \\"festival light\\". Historically luminaria referred not to a paper lantern but to a small festival or vigil bonfire; however, this distinction is not commonly made outside of northern New Mexico. New Mexico traditionalists insist that the use of luminaria to mean a paper lantern is not proper. Farolitos may be referred to as \\"luminarias\\" by some, but on Christmas Eve, when the farolitos are lit in Santa Fe, luminarias (Posada vigil fires) are burning in the small mountain villages of Northern New Mexico. Luminaria bonfires made of square, stacked pi√±on and juniper wood can often can be seen in towns and pueblos across northern New Mexico. In the mountain villages and by the roadways they are built by local residents to welcome visitors and to commemorate holiday activities.

Eugene Lyons (July 1, 1898 ‚Äì January 7, 1985) was an American journalist and writer. A fellow traveler of Communism in his younger years, Lyons became highly critical of the Soviet Union after several years there as a correspondent of United Press International. Lyons also wrote a biography of President Herbert Hoover. Background Eugene Lyons was born July 1, 1898, to a Jewish family in the town of Uzlyany, now part of Belarus but then part of the Russian Empire. His parents were Nathan Lyons and Minnie Privin. His parents emigrated to the US, and he grew up among the teeming tenements of the Lower East Side of New York City. \\"I thought myself a 'socialist' almost as soon as I thought at all,\\" Lyons recalled in his memoirs. As a youth he attended a Socialist Sunday School on East Broadway, where he sang socialist hymns such as \\"The Internationale\\" and \\"The Red Flag.\\" He later enrolled as a member of the Young People's Socialist League, the youth section of the Socialist Party of America (SPA). In 1916, Lyons enrolled in the College of the City of New York before he transferred to Columbia University the next year. Career =Early career= During his school years he worked as an assistant to an English teacher in an adult education course.Eugene Lyons, Assignment in Utopia.

En route, he met another aspiring correspondent bearing identical credentials, Norman H. Matson, and the pair decided to spend the next six months sharing expenses in pursuit of their common goal. Versed in the ongoing case against the Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, Lyons made the pilgrimage to Sacco's native village of Torremaggiore, where Sacco's older brother Sabino was the mayor.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pg. 24. Lyons's Italian experiences were later put to use in his first book, The Life and Death of Sacco and Vanzetti, which was published in 1927 by the Communist- affiliated International Publishers in which he argued the case for the pair's innocence. In Italy, Lyons was approached by an official of the Soviet Union's new Italian embassy to become a secret courier. The Soviets thought that as an American, he could cross frontiers safely, but before anything came of that, Lyons was arrested by the Italian police as a radical and expelled into France.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 25‚Äì27. Back in America, Lyons spent 1921 and most of 1922 in Boston working for the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti. He met the pair frequently in prison.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pg. 34. In the fall of 1922, Lyons became editor of Soviet Russia Pictorial, the monthly magazine of the Friends of Soviet Russia, an organization that was closely connected with the then-underground Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Lyons later recalled that \\"unhesitatingly, I cast my lot with the Communists. I devoted the next five years largely to Soviet activities.\\"Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pg. 37. After Soviet Russia Pictorial was closed down in 1924, Lyons became a correspondent for the Soviet news agency TASS. =USSR= Lyons' work for TASS led to his becoming the United Press (UP) correspondent in Moscow (1928‚Äì1934). Instead of reporting from the United States for the Soviet press, he would now write on Soviet events for an American audience. While Lyons never joined the CPUSA, he had close ties with it and was considered a fellow traveler. The UP thought that Lyons' political background and the close contacts it implied would give him and it an edge over its competition in delivering news from the Soviet Union. Lyons remained the UP's man in Moscow from 1928 to 1934, which gradually transformed him from a friend of the Soviet state and communism to a tireless and fierce critic of both. Lyons was initially supportive of the Soviet regime and found its repressive actions credible. He covered the 1928 Shakhty Trial of mining engineers, which is now regarded by historians as a precursor to the show trials of the late 1930s. Lyons saw that the trial was unfair and that the accused were denied an opportunity to fully defend themselves, but he still believed that they must have been guilty of something. UP's choice of Lyons paid dividends in 1930. On November 22, he was summoned to the Kremlin for a surprise interview with Joseph Stalin, a move to eliminate rumors circulating in the West about the Soviet leader's demise. Lyons thus became the first Western journalist to interview Stalin, and his report of the encounter represented a major \\"scoop.\\"The original typescript of Lyons' cable containing his interview with Stalin, signed off by Stalin as \\"in general, more or less correct,\\" may be seen in the Eugene Lyon Papers at the University of Oregon. Lyons later recounted his meeting with the Soviet leader, a conversation that was conducted in Russian with the occasional help of a translator: > One cannot live in the shadow of Stalin's legend without coming under its > spell. My pulse, I am sure, was high. No sooner, however, had I stepped > across the threshold than diffidence and nervousness fell away. Stalin met > me at the door and shook hands, smiling. There was a certain shyness in his > smile and the handshake was not perfunctory. He was remarkably unlike the > scowling, self-important dictator of popular imagination. His every gesture > was a rebuke to the thousand little bureaucrats who had inflicted their puny > greatness upon me in these Russian years.. > 'Comrade Stalin,' I began the interview, 'may I quote you to the effect that > you have not been assassinated?' > He laughed. At such close range, there was not a trace of the Napoleonic > quality one sees in his self-conscious camera or oil portraits. The shaggy > mustache, framing a sensual mouth and a smile nearly as full of teeth as > Teddy Roosevelt's, gave his swarthy face a friendly, almost benignant look. > 'Yes, you may,' he said, 'except that I hate to take the bread out of the > mouth of the Riga correspondents.'Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 384‚Äì385. (Charles Malamuth served as assistant to Lyons and accompanied him to the interview with Stalin. ) Lyons' interview with Stalin ran two hours in duration, joined midway by Commissar of Defense Kliment Voroshilov.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 387, 390. Lyons' cable detailing the interview was widely reproduced across America and was hailed by an editorial in the New York Daily News as \\"the most distinguished piece of reporting of this year, if not the last four or five years.\\"Cited in Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pg. 391. On the heels of his journalistic coup, Lyons returned to the United States for a brief visit in March 1931, making a lecture tour to 20 Northeastern cities organized by UP.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 397, 400. Lyons had already begun to harbor doubts about the violence and repression associated with the Soviet regime and was torn between \\"looming doubts and waning loyalties,\\" but Lyons found himself engaged to speak mostly before businessmen's luncheon clubs. \\"Looking into their self-satisfied faces, I could forget my doubts,\\" Lyons later recalled. He delivered a blinkered defense of the revolution to his assembled audiences.Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 398‚Äì399. \\"Had I remained in America permanently I might have evolved a new, if badly scarred and patched, enthusiasm,\\" Lyons wrote in his memoirs. \\"I might have ended by contributing high-minded lies to The New Masses and slept happily ever after.\\"Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pp. 414‚Äì415. But Lyons did return to the Soviet Union later that year. He found the GPU imposing ever-increasing terror against recalcitrant peasants, anyone suspected of secretly holding gold or foreign currency, and those accused of economic crimes such as sabotage: > The newspapers were filled with the same braggadocio and threats. Victories, > successes, triumphs, but the plan for spring sowing far behind; three shots > for sabotaging the rabbit-breeding plans; enginemen and signalmen shot for > counter-revolutionary negligence in connection with a disaster on the Kursk > line; eighty-four arrested for forging bread cards. Another internal loan > was being oversubscribed ‚Äî 'voluntary' contributions of a month's wages or > two months' wages. Another blast-furnace started in Magnitogorsk. Poincar√©- > War and agents of imperialism and dastardly kulaks and Left-Right and Right- > Left deviators and secret Trotskyists and heil Stalin and 2 + 2 = 5.\\"Lyons, > Assignment in Utopia, pp. 415‚Äì416. His doubts gradually overwhelmed his faith in the revolution. Lyons was among the earliest writers to criticize the New York Times Moscow reporter Walter Duranty for journalistic dishonesty. Writing about Duranty in 1941, Lyons said, \\"Of all his elliptical writing, perhaps his handling of the famine was the most celebrated. It was the logical extreme of his oft-repeated assertion that 'you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.' Now he made his omelet by referring to the famine as 'undernourishment.'\\" Ironically, Lyons himself had played a role in concealing the 1932‚Äì33 terror famine in Ukraine when he denounced British journalist Gareth Jones as a liar. Jones had written initial reports of the famine and published the first significant reports of the massive famine in the Manchester Guardian, only to have the veracity of his reporting denounced by Lyons, Duranty, and others in the Moscow press corps. Lyons later self-critically recalled that \\"throwing down Jones was as unpleasant a chore as fell to any of us in years of juggling facts to please dictatorial regimes ‚Äî but throw him down we did, unanimously and in almost identical formulas of equivocation. Poor Gareth Jones must have been the most surprised human being alive when the facts he so painstakingly garnered from our mouths were snowed under by our denials.\\"Lyons, Assignment in Utopia, pg. 575. =US= After his return to the United States early in 1934, Lyons wrote two books about his Moscow years. The first was a rather-subdued work, Moscow Carrousel. Published in 1935, it was followed by a far more outspoken account of events, Assignment in Utopia , which was published in 1937. Lyons' writing directly influenced George Orwell.Review of Assignment in Utopia in The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell In his seminal novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell borrowed a chapter title from Assignment in Utopia, \\"Two Plus Two Equals Five.\\" Lyons recalled that it was a common slogan in the Soviet Union during the drive to complete the first Five-Year Plan in just four years. Orwell adapted it as a metaphor for official totalitarian lying. Following his return from the Soviet Union, Lyons very briefly flirted with Trotskyism,Alan M. Wald, The New York Intellectuals: The Rise and Decline of the Anti-Stalinist Left from the 1930s to the 1980s (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987), p. 149. and Leon Trotsky initially praised Assignment in UtopiaLeon Trotsky, \\"Twenty Years of Stalinist Degeneration,\\" 1938. but soon became quite critical of Lyons, who moved to the political right.Leon Trotsky: 1942: In Defense of Marxism Chapter IV After two books on his Moscow experience and a biography of Stalin, Lyons set to work on a full-length study of CPUSA influence on American cultural life in the 1930s, The Red Decade. The book was not popular when first published in 1941, however, as soon after it saw print, the Soviet Union was invaded by Nazi Germany and became an American ally in World War II. The book's fame came only later, during the era of McCarthyism, when its title became a byword for the popular front alliance between Communists and liberals in the 1930s. In later years, Lyons' political views shifted to the right, and for a time, he was editor with Reader's Digest, Plain Talk and National Review. He was also involved with Radio Free Europe and was also a member of the American Jewish League Against Communism. In the early 1940s and the Second Red Scare that followed World War II, Lyons was a frequent contributor to the popular press on anticommunist themes and criticized liberals whom he deemed inadequate in their denunciations of the Soviet regime. In The American Mercury, Lyons was critical of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt for lending her prestige to a gathering of the American Youth Congress, a front joint organization bringing together Communist and Socialist student groups.Eugene Lyons, \\"Mrs. Roosevelt's Youth Congress,\\" The American Mercury, vol. 49 (April 1940), pp. 481‚Äì484. In 1947, Lyons attacked former Vice President Henry A. Wallace as an appeaser of the Soviet dictatorship who refused to face up to the true nature of the regime.Eugene Lyons, \\"Wallace and the Communists,\\" The American Mercury, vol. 65, pp. 133‚Äì140. Writing for the American Legion in 1950, Lyons accepted the premise that American government agencies had been infiltrated by Soviet spies.Eugene Lyons, \\"Who's Hysterical?\\" American Legion Magazine, vol. 48 (March 1950), p. 20. He also lauded the work of the House Committee on Un- American Activities for its work investigating the activities of the CPUSA and exposing Communists in the government employ.Eugene Lyons, \\"The Men the Commies Hate Most,\\" American Legion Magazine, vol. 49 (October 1950), pp. 14‚Äì15. In addition to his work as a freelance journalist, Lyons wrote biographies. He published a widely-read biography of former President Herbert Hoover in 1964. In 1966, he published a biography of his first cousin David Sarnoff, the chairman of RCA and founder of NBC. Lyons returned to the topic of Soviet Communism in his final book, Workers' Paradise Lost, published in 1967. Death and legacy Lyons died age 86 on January 7, 1985, in New York City. His papers are housed at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and in the Special Collections department of Knight Library at the University of Oregon in Eugene.

AUSTRAC was established in 1989 under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, at ComLaw It implements in Australia the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which Australia joined in 1990. AUSTRAC's existence was continued under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act). The AML/CTF Act came into effect on 12 December 2006, and extended the existing monitoring regime to cover terrorism financing and listed terrorist organisations. Under Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), it is illegal to finance terrorism.Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) s 1.1, Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Retrieved 20 January 2015. The Attorney-General's Department maintains a list of outlawed terror organisations. In 2014 AUSTRAC released a report, Terrorism financing in Australia 2014, which says, \\"Terrorism financing poses a serious threat to Australians and Australian interests at home and abroad.\\" AUSTRAC is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units and an observer in the Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network and is a member of FATF and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. It is also a member of the Asset Recovery Interagency Network Asia Pacific. Certain classes of financial services are required to be reported to AUSTRAC, in particular bank cash transactions (i.e., notes and coins) of A$10,000 or more, as well as suspicious transactions and all international transfers. Reports to AUSTRAC must be made within 10 business days. The information that AUSTRAC collects is available for use by law enforcement, revenue, regulatory, security and other agencies.  Operation  \\"Reporting entities\\" are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC. Transactions which must be reported include: * cash transactions of A$10,000 or more, or foreign currency of that value, * international funds transfer instructions, either into or out of Australia, of any amount, and * suspicious transactions of any kind, being transactions the dealer may reasonably suspect of being part of tax evasion or crime, or might assist in a prosecution. Australia's cash controls require travellers to report to AUSTRAC when they carry $10,000 or more (or equivalent in a foreign currency) of cash (or equivalent) into or out of Australia, which can be done on forms available from the Border Force at airports and sea ports. The Border Force attempts to detect evasion of this requirement. Airlines are not liable for what their passengers carry. Cross-border movement of bearer negotiable instruments of any amount must also be reported if requested by a Border Force or police officer. It's an offence under the Act for anyone to split a transaction into two or more parts with a dominant purpose of avoiding the reporting rules and thresholds. Certain classes of transactions are exempt, or may be exempted on application. For example, established customers transacting amounts typical of their lawful business, such as for payroll, or retail or vending machine takings, etc. Motor vehicle traders are specifically not eligible for exemption, as are boats, farm machinery and aircraft traders. Under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, any person can access records held by AUSTRAC, subject to certain exemptions.Freedom of Information Guidelines page at AUSTRAC web site Reporting entities Entities which are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC are called \\"reporting entities\\", which are specified in the AML/CTF Act. These entities deal in cash, bullion, cryptocurrencies and financial transactions, and include: * banks and similar financial institutions, such as building societies * corporations * insurance companies and intermediaries * securities dealers, such as stock brokers * unit trust managers and trustees (but cash management trusts transacting only by cheque or similar are exempt) * traveler's cheque or money order issuers * cash carriers and payroll preparation businesses * casinos * bookmakers, including totalisator agencies * bullion dealers * solicitors, acting on their own behalf (e.g., their trust fund, or originated mortgages) * Digital Currency exchange providers https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/industry-specific-guidance/digital- currency-exchange-providers  Identification  Reporting entities must identify their customers using the 100-point check system. Accounts may only be opened, but can only be operated (i.e., withdrawals made) by an identified customer; an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals. Generally identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution. For banks and similar reporting entities, identification requirements are determined by a risk-based approach, which may differ for each reporting entity. It's an offence to open or operate an account with a reporting entity under an alias or false name, punishable by a fine or up to 2 years imprisonment.  Other agencies  The information that AUSTRAC collects is also available to a large number of government agencies, including: * Australian Taxation Office (ATO) * State and territory revenue offices * Child Support Agency Australia (CSA) * Australian Federal Police (AFP), and which may then communicate information to foreign law enforcement agencies, with appropriate undertakings * State and territory police services * Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) * Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission * Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) * Department of Home Affairs, Australia * Centrelink (added in 2004) * State commissions and royal commissions against corruption ‚Äì  Crime and Misconduct Commission, Queensland  Corruption and Crime Commission, Western Australia (added in 2004)  Independent Commission Against Corruption, New South Wales  New South Wales Crime Commission  Police Integrity Commission, New South Wales * Foreign countries, with appropriate undertakings.  Breaches  One prominent attempted evasion of the AUSTRAC rules took place ahead of the Dutch takeover of TNT (see TNT N.V.) in 1999. Simon Hannes was an executive at Macquarie Bank, which was advising TNT, and he bought about $90,000 of TNT call options under the name \\"Mark Booth\\" to profit when the bid was announced. He was convicted of insider trading but also of two offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act since he had made multiple cash withdrawals and deposits each just under the $10,000 threshold, apparently to avoid that reporting. His sentence for those transactions was 4 months jail.Simon Hannes sentenced: two and a half years jail , press release by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 13 December 2002R v Hannes (2002), Supreme Court of New South Wales report, at AustLII In March 2017, AUSTRAC fined Tabcorp Holdings Limited $45 million for breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Tabcorp were found to have failed to make reports of suspicious behaviour on 108 occasions over more than five years. In the agreed facts put forward to the Federal Court by AUSTRAC and Tabcorp, Tabcorp directors were not made aware of any significant deficiencies in the company's AML/CTF program, until such matters were raised directly with Tabcorp by AUSTRAC, in 2014. On 3 August 2017, AUSTRAC took action against the Commonwealth Bank alleging that it did not report cash transactions over $10,000 within the required 10 business day period, or at all. The alleged breaches involved over 53,700 transactions over $10,000 through a type of ATM that allowed anonymous cash deposits up to $20,000. In June 2018, the Commonwealth Bank agreed to pay a $700 million fine to settle the action, with CBA admitting to a host of breaches, including that millions of dollars were laundered through its ATMs by criminals including drug and firearms importers and that CBA failed to properly file more than 53,000 reports to Austrac over cash deposits of more than $10,000 in its ATMs. CBA also admitted that 149 ‚Äúsuspicious matter reports‚Äù were filed late, or not at all.The Age, 4 June 2018, CBA to pay record $700m to settle money-laundering case In November 2019, AUSTRAC took action against Westpac alleging \\"systemic non-compliance\\" with AML/CTF 23 million times and covering $11 billion of transactions, involving the failure to properly vet thousands of transactions that could be linked to child exploitation and live child sex shows in the Philippines and other parts of south-east Asia.The Age, 20 November 2019, Westpac accused of 23 million breaches by money laundering watchdog A Crown Resorts executive authorised the transfer of $500,000 to a drug trafficker and nightclub operator in January 2017, which was not reported to AUSTRAC for a year.

An environmentalist, author, activist, and lawyer, May founded and served as the Executive Director of the Sierra Club Canada from 1989 to 2006. May was the longest serving female leader of a Canadian federal party. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Elizabeth May immigrated to Canada with her family as a teenager. She attended St. Francis Xavier University, graduated from Dalhousie University with a law degree in 1983, and later studied theology at Saint Paul University for which she told the Anglican Journal in a 2013 interview that she had to withdraw from the program due to conflicting schedule demands. Following her graduation from Dalhousie University, May worked as an environmental lawyer in Halifax before moving to Ottawa in 1985, joining the Public Interest Advocacy Centre as the associate general council. In 1986 she was named Senior Policy Advisor to Thomas McMillan, then-Environment Minister in the Progressive Conservative Mulroney government. As senior policy advisor, May was deeply involved in the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer. She resigned on principle from the position in 1988 over permits for construction of a dam granted without environmental assessments, which were later determined to be illegal by a federal court. In 2006, after building the Sierra Club into a nationally effective organization, May resigned to run for leadership of the Green Party of Canada, winning on the first ballot with 66% of the vote. On May 2, 2011, May became the first member of the Green Party of Canada to be elected as a Member of Parliament, defeating Conservative cabinet minister Gary Lunn with 46% of the vote in the Saanich‚ÄìGulf Islands riding. In the 2019 federal election, she was re-elected with 54% of the vote. May resigned as Green Party leader on November 4, 2019 but remains as parliamentary leader in the house. Elizabeth May has been an officer of the Order of Canada since 2005, and has been named by the United Nations as one of the leading women environmentalists worldwide. She was named by fellow MPs as Parliamentarian of the Year 2012, Hardest Working MP 2013, and Best Orator 2014. In 2010, Newsweek named her as one of the world's most influential women. May has written eight books; her memoir, Who We Are - Reflections of my Life and Canada was listed as a best-seller by The Globe and Mail.  Early life and education  May was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the daughter of Stephanie (Middleton), a sculptor, pianist, and writer, and John Middleton May, an accountant. Her father was born in New York and raised in England, and her mother was also a native New Yorker. She has a younger brother named Geoffrey. Her mother was a prominent anti-nuclear activist and her father was Assistant Vice President of Aetna Life and Casualty. The family moved to Margaree Harbour, Nova Scotia in 1972, following a summer vacation spent on Cape Breton Island. On moving to the province, the May family purchased a landlocked schooner, the Marion Elizabeth which had been used as a gift shop and restaurant since the mid 1950s. They operated this establishment from 1974 until 2002. May briefly enrolled at St. Francis Xavier University in 1974, but dropped out.E. May, Budworm Battles, Four East books: Tantallon NS, 1981 Returning to Margaree, May took correspondence courses in restaurant management. Beginning in 1980, she attended Dalhousie Law School as a mature student, graduating in 1983. Following law school at Dalhousie University, May worked as an associate at small law firm in Halifax. May studied theology at Saint Paul University, a federated college of the University of Ottawa.  Public life  May first became known in the Canadian media in the mid-1970s through her leadership as a volunteer in the grassroots movement against proposed aerial insecticide spraying on forests near her home on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The effort prevented aerial insecticide spraying from ever occurring in Nova Scotia. Years later, she and a local group of residents went to court to prevent herbicide spraying. Winning a temporary injunction in 1982 held off the spray programme, but after two years, the case was eventually lost. In the course of the litigation, her family sacrificed their home and seventy acres of land in an adverse court ruling to Scott Paper. However, by the time the judge ruled the chemicals were safe, 2,4,5-T's export from the U.S. had been banned. The forests of Nova Scotia were spared from being the last areas in Canada to be sprayed with Agent Orange. In 1980, May and others launched a political party to raise environmental and anti-nuclear issues dubbed \\"the Small Party\\". The party ran 12 candidates in six provinces in the 1980 federal election. May, at the time a 25-year-old waitress, ran against the former Deputy Prime Minister, Allan J. MacEachen in Cape Breton Highlands‚ÄîCanso. She placed last in a field of four candidates receiving 272 votes. In 1985, May moved to Ottawa to work with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. She held the position of Associate General Counsel representing consumer, poverty and environment groups from 1985‚Äì86. In 1986, May became Senior Policy Advisor to then-environment minister, Thomas McMillan of the Progressive Conservatives. She was instrumental in the creation of several national parks, including South Moresby. She was involved in negotiating the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, new legislation and pollution control measures. In 1988, she resigned on principle when the Minister granted permits for the Rafferty-Alameda Dams in Saskatchewan without proper environmental assessment. The permits were later struck down by a Federal Court decision that found that the permits were granted illegally. May helped found the Canadian Environmental Defence Fund with the aim of funding groups and individuals in environmental cases. She has worked extensively with indigenous peoples internationally, particularly in the Amazon, as well as with Canadian First Nations. She was the first volunteer Executive Director of Cultural Survival Canada from 1989‚Äì1992 and worked for the Algonquin of Barriere Lake from 1991‚Äì1992. She has taught courses at Queen's University School of Policy Studies, as well as teaching for a year at Dalhousie University to develop the programme established in her name in Women's Health and Environment. =Sierra Club of Canada= In 1989, May became the founding Executive Director of the Sierra Club of Canada. During her tenure with the Sierra Club of Canada, May received several awards in recognition of her environmental leadership, including: the International Conservation Award from the Friends of Nature, the United Nations Global 500 Award in 1990, the award for Outstanding Leadership in Environmental Education by the Ontario Society for Environmental Education in 1996, and in November 2005 was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of her \\"decades of leadership in the Canadian environmental movement\\". In April 2006, May announced her resignation as the Sierra Club's executive director in order to seek the leadership of the Green Party of Canada. As one of her last major acts she participated in a poll of experts that determined that Progressive Conservative Brian Mulroney was Canada's \\"greenest\\" Prime Minister for an award presented by Corporate Knights magazine. For her prominent role in this initiative, May took some criticism from commentators and environmentalists. Upon leaving the Sierra Club, Board President Louise Comeau noted, \\"Elizabeth has led the Club at the national level from its infancy to the enormously effective entity it is today, she was also instrumental in supporting development of the Sierra Youth Coalition, the Atlantic Canada Chapter and other Sierra Club chapters and local grassroots groups.\\"  Political career  = Early leadership = May (right foreground) at the 2006 Green Party of Canada leadership debate On May 9, 2006, May entered the Green Party of Canada's leadership race. On August 26, 2006, May won the leadership election on the first ballot. She tallied 65.3% of the votes, beating her main rival, David Chernushenko (33.3%) and Jim Fannon (0.88%). She said one of the main platforms for the next election would be to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). At the time of her election as leader, May said she intended to run in the riding of Cape Breton‚ÄîCanso in the next federal election, although she also said she would stand in a federal byelection if one occurred prior to the next general election. In the fall of 2006, May ran for election in London North Centre, finishing second to Glen Pearson of the Liberal Party. While she lost, May's showing in this by-election was the best result, in terms of percentage, achieved by the Green Party of Canada at that time. In April 2007, during a speech by May to a London, Ontario United Church of Canada, she condemned Prime Minister Stephen Harper's stance on climate change, comparing it to \\"a grievance worse than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of the Nazis.\\" The statement drew criticism from the Canadian Jewish Congress and opposition parties. While Opposition leader St√©phane Dion refused to respond to Harper's request for him to distance himself from May and these remarks during Question Period, Dion did state to reporters outside Commons that May should withdraw the remarks, and that the Nazi regime is beyond any comparison. May said she was having \\"a lousy week\\" because of the federal government's weak action plan on the environment, but stood by her comments. In a Green Party of Canada press release, May stated that she was referencing a Chamberlain Nazi appeasement analogy made by journalist George Monbiot a few days earlier. saying \\"I made reference to Mr. Monbiot's statement to highlight the damage being done to Canada's international reputation, something that should concern all Canadians.\\" May marching in the 2008 Toronto Pride Parade On March 17, 2007, May announced that she would run in the Nova Scotia riding of Central Nova, in the 2008 federal election. The riding was held by Conservative National Defence Minister Peter MacKay. May has explained that she chose Central Nova to avoid running against a Liberal or NDP incumbent. On April 12, 2007, Liberal Party leader St√©phane Dion announced that the Liberals would not run a candidate in Central Nova in return for the Greens not running a candidate in Dion's safe Saint-Laurent‚ÄîCartierville riding. There was criticism from prominent Green Party members of May's failing to support all Green candidates unequivocally during the 2008 election, as she made favorable comments about Liberal leader St√©phane Dion and said that supporters in close ridings might consider voting strategically to attempt to defeat the Conservatives. May was initially excluded from the televised national leadership debate in the 2008 federal election, based on the lack of any elected Green party MPs. She argued that the TV network consortium's initial exclusion of the Green Party of Canada was \\"anti-democratic\\" and blamed it on \\"the decision-making of a small group of TV network executives\\". Eventually May was invited to attend the televised debate. May received 32% of the vote in Central Nova in 2008 to MacKay's 47%. Nationally the Greens received 6.8 percent of the popular vote. =Member of Parliament= In 2010, following a survey of potentially favourable electoral districts across the county, May announced her intention to run in Saanich‚ÄîGulf Islands, in British Columbia against Conservative cabinet minister Gary Lunn. On March 29, 2011 the broadcast consortium organizing the televised national leaders' debate for the 2011 federal election announced that it would not invite May. Despite her exclusion from the national debates, she won her riding, defeating the incumbent Gary Lunn. Nationally the Greens received 4 percent of the popular vote. May speaks at the Fair Vote Canada National Day of Action in Ottawa, May 2011. In 2012, May tabled a Private member's bill, Bill C-442, with the aim of creating a national framework to address Lyme disease. On December 16, 2014, Bill C-442 received royal assent, becoming law. Bill C-442 was the first piece of Green Party legislation enacted in the history of Canada, and was passed with unanimous consent by both houses of Parliament. The bill was introduced by May in response to the rise of lyme disease across Canada, and in recognition of the findings by groups including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who have noted that as a result of climate change Lyme disease is beginning to spread more quickly, as the number of ticks‚Äî who serve as vectors for Lyme disease‚Äì steadily increases. In December 2014, May presented a petition to the House of Commons by members of 9/11 Truth organizations asking the government to review the September 11 attacks in New York. While she personally did not agree with the petition, May defended presenting it and stated \\"It is an obligation of an MP to present every petition submitted to them.\\" While many MPs consider it a responsibility, House of Commons rules do not require MPs to present all petitions they receive to Parliament. In 2012, the NDP Foreign Affairs Critic Paul Dewar declined to present a similar petition by another 9/11 Truth group to parliament. Annually, Maclean's Magazine organizes an awards ceremony in which MPs recognize the achievements and hard work of their colleagues. In 2012, May was voted by her colleagues in the House of Commons as Parliamentarian of the Year, in 2013 she was voted Hardest Working MP, and in 2014 she was voted Best Orator. May was the first MP to take a stand against Bill C-51, on February 3, 2015 Toronto Star National Affairs columnist Thomas Walkom noted that, \\"So far, the only opposition MP with enough guts to critique the content of the Conservative government's new anti-terror bill is Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.\\" May and fellow Green MP Bruce Hyer tabled sixty amendments during clause-by-clause considerations of Bill C-51 ‚Äì all sixty amendments were rejected by the government. May later stated of Bill C-51, \\"It's not fixable. Stop it. Repeal it.\\" On April 23, 2015, May had two amendments to Bill C-46, the Pipelines Safety Act, accepted. These were the first Green Party amendments to a government bill ever adopted. The first amendment enabled \\"aboriginal governing bodies to be reimbursed for actions they take in relation to a spill\\". Prior to the amendment, the bill outlined that those at fault in a spill would only be liable for \\"costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province or any other person\\". The second amendment was related to the concept of polluter pays. The original line in the bill said that the National Energy Board \\"may\\" recover funds to compensate those affected by a spill, the Green Party amendment changed the \\"may\\" to \\"shall\\". May announcing the Green Party's educational policy during the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign In October 2015, Prime Minister-designate Justin Trudeau invited May to be part of the Canadian delegation to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris, France, in late November 2015; the summit was intended to negotiate post-2020 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and resulted in the GHGPPA. According to Maclean's, \\"May, who requested and received a 30-minute meeting with Trudeau this week even as he was immersed in transition plans for swearing in a new Liberal government on Nov. 4, said his willingness to engage with opposition parties is also encouraging, suggesting a less hyper-partisan style of governing.\\" On March 23, 2018, May was arrested for civil contempt during a demonstration against the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Other members of the demonstration, including fellow Member of Parliament Kennedy Stewart, were also arrested concerning the same incident. They were accused of violating a court order requiring those demonstrating to stay five meters back from company work sites, when they allegedly blocked the roadway. On April 9, 2018, Justice Kenneth Affleck of the British Columbia Supreme Court recommended that May and the others arrested should be charged with criminal contempt in relation to the alleged incident. On April 16, 2018, it was reported that special prosecutors would be overseeing the charges against May and Stewart. On May 14, 2018, the special prosecutor handling May's case told Justice Affleck that the province was pursuing a criminal contempt of court prosecution against May. On May 28, 2018, May pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court and was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,500. May has called for a doubling of Canada's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets to a 60% reduction from 2005 levels, instead of the current 30%.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/green-party-carbon-emissions-climate- change-1.5138676 Controversies =Stance on abortion= During a visit in 2006 to the Mount St. Joseph's Convent in London, Ontario, May responded to a nun's question about her position on abortion, saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think a woman has a frivolous right to choose. What I don‚Äôt want is a desperate woman to die in an illegal abortion.‚Äù Following initial reports of May's statements, which did not include the full quote, prominent Canadian feminist Judy Rebick announced that she was withdrawing her previous support of May and the Green Party because of May's questioning \\"the most important victory of the women's movement of my generation\\". May later clarified that she had been trying to explain to the nuns how \\"their belief in right to life means that they should support abortion\\". She explained that making abortions illegal would cause more deaths from desperate illegal abortions, as had been the case for hundreds of years previously. In a 2011 interview with the Georgia Straight, May said her position had been \\"massively misreported\\" and explained \\"If a woman is in a situation where she‚Äôd like to keep her child and needs support, we also want to be there to support that choice and also to ensure that as much as possible we, in our society, provide‚Äînot just for women, but for male partners‚Äîresponsibility, birth-control information in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies ‚Ä¶ So, it‚Äôs a mixed and nuanced position, but there‚Äôs absolutely no wiggle room on maintaining the right of women in this country to safe and legal abortions.\\" She stressed that there is \\"no going back\\" on the issue, and that she is \\"very militant\\" about it. May was interviewed by a CBC videographer that was published two days prior to the start of the 2019 federal election. May stated that the Green Party would not ban elected MPs from reopening the abortion debate. May's reasoning was that despite her own personal pro-choice views, Green Party rules do not give her the power as leader to whip votes in caucus. This position put the Greens in stark contrast to the Liberals and the NDP, both of which require attestations from MPs that they will consistently support the party's stated pro-choice platform. The Green Party released an official statement clarifying May's comments, saying that candidates are prescreened to rule out anti-choice viewpoints, but that May's initial statement regarding the leader not having the power to whip votes remains official Green Party policy. May later backed away from the comments, saying that any Green MP who moved to re-open the debate would risk being removed from caucus. =Pseudoscience= In November 2011, May tweeted concerns about the possible dangers of WiFi. May's comments that WiFi was a \\"possible human carcinogen\\" and that the use of WiFi might be related to the \\"disappearance of pollinating insects\\" fueled attacks over the scientific soundness of her views. \\"It is very disturbing how quickly Wi-Fi has moved into schools as it is children who are the most vulnerable\\", she wrote. The National Post pointed out that May had ironically made the tweets on her cellphone. In June 2013, during a Twitter exchange with May, a Green Party critic downloaded the party's platform and found reference to the party's support of government-subsidized homeopathy. Homeopathy found its way into the platform \\"by accident\\", May later said. =In defense of Jian Ghomeshi= In October 2014, May sent out a series of tweets defending Jian Ghomeshi, who faced allegations from three women that the radio host was physically violent to them without their consent during sexual encounters. \\"I think Jian is wonderful. Likely TMI for an old fogey like me, but his private life is none of our beeswax\\", May wrote. May then wrote, \\"I have known Jian and something at work here doesn't make sense. Innocent until proven guilty.\\" When one user accused her of buying into \\"rape culture,\\" she replied, \\"As a feminist, I do not buy into rape culture.\\" May later stated that she regretted defending Ghomeshi, stating that she had not yet read about the allegations of physical violence in the Toronto Star and that she was still \\"shaken up\\" by the Parliament Hill shootings when she wrote the tweets. =2015 Press Gallery Dinner speech= At the Parliamentary Press Gallery's dinner in Gatineau, Quebec on May 9, 2015, May was recorded on video in front of an audience stating, \\"Welcome back, Omar Khadr. It matters to say it. Welcome back, Omar Khadr. You're home\\", in reference to Omar Khadr, a convicted child soldier. She further said, \\"Omar Khadr, you've got more class than the whole fucking cabinet\\", before being escorted off the stage by Transport Minister Lisa Raitt. Early in her speech she also questioned why no one else had mentioned the event was being held on First Nations territory, asking \\"What the fuck is wrong with the rest of you?\\" May later blamed her actions on fatigue and insisted she hadn't had too much to drink. \\"I didn't have a lot of wine,\\" May said, \\"but it may have hit me harder than I thought it would\\". When questioned if she should resign, May responded that \\"a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell.\\" May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Quebec, were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. \\"Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that\\", Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, \\"She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized\\", Peck said. \\"One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern.\\" It's more of an \\"inside Ottawa beltway\\" thing anyway, Peck added. Other senior members of the media have called into question why this speech received so much attention from the press. CBC's Michael Enright noted that the Press Gallery Dinner has long been home to rowdy behaviour by both politicians and journalists, usually attracting little or no coverage. In his Sunday Edition segment, Enright even pondered, \\"Why the mountain of coverage, nearly all of it unsympathetic? Was it because she was appearing before a roomful of journalists? Would the story have disappeared if she had been speaking to environmentalists? Was it because she sometimes has seemed to be holier than thou? Was it because she is a woman? Whatever the reason, May was mugged by the media.\\" =Bullying allegations= In January 2018, Elizabeth May faced accusations of workplace bullying from former interim executive director Rob Rainer, who said she should be forced to resign and sit as an independent MP. May vehemently denied the accusations and called for an independent investigation of the complaints, telling reporters, ‚ÄúI am consistently opposed to bullying. I‚Äôve stood up to bullying numerous times.‚Äù The third-party investigation team subsequently cleared May, finding the accusations to be completely without merit.  Personal life  May has one daughter with former partner Ian Burton, Victoria Cate May Burton, who was the Green candidate in Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√© in 2015, losing to NDP incumbent Ruth Ellen Brosseau. On November 27, 2018, May announced her engagement to John Kidder, brother of actress Margot Kidder and one of the founders of the Green Party of British Columbia. Kidder had previously run as the 2011 federal Liberal candidate in Okanagan‚ÄîCoquihalla and as the 2013 BC Green candidate in Fraser-Nicola. May and Kidder married on April 22, 2019 at Christ Church Cathedral in Victoria, British Columbia. May is a practicing Anglican, and has said she is \\"interested, in the long term, in becoming ordained as an Anglican priest.\\" She cites Jesus Christ as her personal hero, because \\"he led a revolution that was non-violent\\".

Ferteth was the son of his predecessor Malise I, and Rosabella Forteith. His name likely derives from the Gaelic Fer T√©id, \\"Teith Man\\". He first appears in history in 1160, when he came to the Parliament at Perth. On this occasion he, with the help of five other earls, besieged King Malcolm in Perth Castle. The reason for this is not clear, but it may have been a protest against Malcolm's friendship with Henry II of England, which they believed might lead to Scotland becoming an English vassal. The king and the earls were later reconciled, and Earl Ferteth was not punished for his actions. Ferteth took a great interest in ecclesiastical affairs, and it was largely due to his influence that Strathearn was made a separate diocese, headed by the Bishops of Dunblane. He died in 1171, having married a woman named Ethen, of unknown parentage. Ferteth and Ethen had two sons and a daughter: * Gille-Brigte (Gilbert) * Malise, who held Muthil, Ogilvy, Kincardine, Rossie and other lands in Perthshire, and married Ada, illegitimate daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon * Christian, who married Sir Walter Olifard, Justiciar of the Lothians and son of Sir David Olifard.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to guitars: A guitar is a plucked string instrument, usually played with fingers or a pick. The guitar consists of a body with a rigid neck to which the strings, generally six in number, are attached. Most guitar necks have metal frets attached (the exception is fretless bass guitars). Guitars are traditionally constructed of various woods and strung with animal gut or, more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Some modern 2010-era guitars are made of polycarbonate materials. Guitars are made and repaired by luthiers. There are two primary families of guitars: acoustic and electric. An acoustic guitar has a wooden top and a hollow body. An electric guitar may be a solid-body or hollow body instrument, which is made louder by using a pickup and plugging it into a guitar amplifier and speaker. Another type of guitar is the low-pitched bass guitar. What type of instrument is a guitar?

Beginning in 1939, the Nazis used this site as one of six for the T-4 Euthanasia Programme, which performed mass sterilizations and mass murder of \\"undesirable\\" members of German society, specifically those with physical and mental disabilities. In total, an estimated 200,000 people were killed at these facilities, including thousands of children. These actions were in keeping with the eugenics ideas about racial purity developed by German ideologues. While officially ended in 1941, the programme lasted until the German surrender in 1945. Nearly 15,000 German citizens were transported to the hospital and died there, most killed in a gas chamber.Lifton (1986): p.102 In addition, hundreds of forced labourers from Poland and other countries occupied by the Nazis were killed there. Hadamar and its hospital fell within the American occupation zone after the war. From October 8‚Äì15, 1945, United States forces conducted the Hadamar Trial, the first mass atrocity trial in the years following World War II. They prosecuted doctors and staff on charges of murdering citizens of allied countries, namely, forced labourers from Poland and other countries. The US had jurisdiction for these crimes under international law. Several people were convicted and executed for these crimes. After the German courts were reconstructed under the occupation, in 1946 a doctor and nurse were prosecuted by Germans for the murders of nearly 15,000 German citizens at the hospital. Both were convicted. The hospital continues to operate. It holds a memorial to the euthanasia murders as well as an exhibit about the Nazi programme. Operations Viktor Brack, organiser of the T4 Programme Garage of the \\"Grey Buses\\" Interior of the bus garage Since the late 19th century, doctors and scientists had been developing theories of racial purity based on eugenics, a concept popular at the time that developed from several disciplines including social history, biology, anthropology and genetics. As Weindling (1989) explained, there had been several movements in Germany since the end of World War I concerned with the 'degeneration' of German racial purity that culminated with the founding in 1927 of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. Although there had been demands since the early 1920s for legislation on sterilization and euthanasia, these were rejected because it was believed that positive eugenics was more representative of the Weimar political structures and the nation's social needs. This approach ended in 1933 after the ascent of the Nazis in Germany. Action T4 Beginning in 1939, the Nazis set up the T-4 Euthanasia Programme at Hadamar hospital, which housed a psychiatric facility, as one of six to implement the programme. Developed by Viktor Brack, it began with mass sterilizations of children deemed \\"unfit\\" to reproduce. After that, the hospital staff exterminated children determined to be unfit and the programme was later expanded to adults. In the eight months of the first phase of the killing operations (January to August 1941), 10,072 men, women and children were asphyxiated with carbon monoxide in a gas chamber as part of the Nazi \\"euthanasia\\" programme. The gas was obtained in standard cylinders supplied by the chemicals company IG Farben. Thick smoke from the hospital crematorium billowed over Hadamar in the summer of 1941, during which the staff celebrated the cremation of their 10,000th patient with beer and wine Lindsay, Deborah, Behind Barbed Wire, 2020 Despite the hospital's precautions to cover up the T-4 programme, the local population were fully aware of events at the hospital. The people murdered in the Hadamar hospital were brought in by train and bus, apparently vanishing behind the site's high fencing.'My Father's Son', by Dawyck Haig (Pub. Leo Cooper, 2000) P.127. Since the crematorium ovens were more often than not fed with two corpses at a time, the cremation process was less than perfect. This often resulted in the aforementioned thick, acrid smog hanging over the town. According to a letter sent by Bishop Hilfrich of Limburg to the Reich Justice Minister in 1941, local children taunted each other with the words \\"You're not very clever; you will go to Hadamar and into the ovens\\"Nuremberg Trial Documents USA-717 *615-PS Letter from the Bishop of Limburg to the Reich Minister of Justice, 13 August 1941, concerning the annihilation of the \\"unfit to live\\" in the institution of Hadamar\\"Du bist nicht recht gescheit, du kommst nach Hadamar in den backofen\\" Gekrat bus and driver Up to 100 victims arrived in post-buses every day. They were told to disrobe for a \\"medical examination\\". Sent before a physician, each was recorded as having one of 60 fatal diseases, as \\"incurables\\" were to be given a \\"mercy death.\\" The doctor identified each person with different- coloured sticking plasters for one of three categories: kill; kill & remove brain for research; kill & extract gold teeth.Patrizia Barbera: Todgeweihte kamen in Postbussen zur Hinrichtung, in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, page 55, 21 October 2008. (for-pay archive at http://faz.net/) Protests As people learned of these activities, especially the role of the \\"grey buses\\" in collecting victims, there was growing opposition. Hitler officially announced in 1941 that the \\"euthanasia\\" activities had been curtailed. After a brief period of suspension, however, the euthanasia staff renewed the killing of 'undesirables' in 1942. Resident physicians and staff, headed by nurse Irmgard Huber, directly killed the majority of these victims, among whom were German patients with disabilities, mentally-disoriented elderly persons from bombed- out areas, \\"half Jewish\\" children from welfare institutions, psychologically- and physically-disabled forced labourers and their children, German soldiers, and Waffen SS soldiers deemed psychologically incurable. The medical personnel and staff at Hadamar killed almost all of these people by lethal drug overdoses; others died of deliberate neglect. Though the war ended in Germany on 8 May 1945, the Nazi extermination institutions continued to kill disabled patients - or allow them to die of starvation. The last known patient to die at Hadamar was a four-year-old mentally handicapped boy, who was killed on 29 May 1945. In early April 1945, the US 2nd Infantry Division captured the German town of Hadamar and American officials began to learn about the murders at the hospital. The Hadamar psychiatric hospital is in operation today as an asylum and treatment centre. It also houses a memorial to the dead and an exhibition regarding the mass murders of the Programme. Exhibit boards are installed outside the bus garage; it and the hospital itself have been designated as cultural monuments. Hadamar Trial American war crimes investigators question nurse Irmgard Huber at the Hadamar Institute, May 1945 Wahlmann with Karl Willig (right) after their arrest in April 1945 The Hadamar Trial, October 8‚Äì15, 1945, was the first mass atrocity trial in the American occupation zone of Germany following World War II. In the first months of occupation, American military forces had conducted trials based on classical violations of international law, principally for the German murders of captured Allied service personnel, which had occurred in the last months of the war. The discovery in late March 1945 of the \\"euthanasia\\" facility Hadamar near Limburg an der Lahn in west central Germany riveted attention in the United States. U.S. military authorities decided to undertake their first prosecution to adjudicate crimes associated with the systematic racial and social persecution and extermination committed under Nazi Germany policies. Initially, American authorities intended to try Hadamar physicians, nurses, and administrative staff in their custody for the murders of the nearly 15,000 German patients killed at the institution. They quickly discovered that they lacked jurisdiction to do so under international law. U.S. military officials could not try German nationals for murdering their fellow citizens. International law restricted them to prosecute crimes committed against their own service personnel and civilian nationals, and those of their allies, in the territories that they held. Among the Hadamar victims were 476 Soviet and Polish forced labourers. Identified as having tuberculosis, they were transported to Hadamar and killed at the hospital in the last months of the war. As these civilian forced laborers were citizens of countries allied to the United States, American prosecutors were able to open proceedings against seven Hadamar defendants associated with the murders of the \\"Eastern workers.\\" On 15 October 1945, chief United States prosecutor Leon JaworskiJaworski served as the Trial Judge Advocate. Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals ed. UNWCC, London 1947, p. 46 (who later gained prominence in the 1970s as Watergate Special Prosecutor), won convictions for all the accused.Sentences see Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals ed. UNWCC, London 1947, p. 51 The six-man U.S. military tribunal sentenced to death by hanging the Hadamar chief administrator Alfons Klein, and two male nurses, Heinrich Ruoff and Karl Willig. Because of his advanced age, chief physician Adolf Wahlmann, received a life sentence, which was eventually commuted. Two Hadamar administrative staff received sentences of 35 and 30 years, respectively. Irmgard Huber, a nurse and only female defendant, received the lightest sentence, that of 25 years' imprisonment. On 14 March 1946, Klein, Ruoff, and Willig were executed. http://www.gedenkstaette- hadamar.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-616/_lkm-613/i.html In December 1945 the Allies promulgated Allied Control Council Law No. 10, which allowed the elastic charge of \\"crimes against humanity\\" to cover the massive scale of extermination the Germans had carried out against Jews, Poles, Gypsies and other populations. This charge was introduced in the indictment by the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg. In early 1946, \\"euthanasia\\" crimes such as those at Hadamar were transferred to the German courts, newly reconstructed under the occupation. In early 1947, a German tribunal in Frankfurt tried 25 Hadamar personnel, including Dr. Wahlmann and Nurse Huber, for the deaths of some 15,000 German patients killed at the facility. Although some had their sentences increased, most were released early in the 1950s.Heberer, P.

After crossing into Cromwell, it intersects Route 372, which offers access to Route 9 just east of the intersection. After overpassing Route 9, it continues north into Rocky Hill and overpasses Interstate 91 without an interchange (access is via West Street [SSR 411]). After a brief concurrency with Route 160, it crosses into Wethersfield, where it meets the eastern end of Route 287 and crosses over Route 99. After the Silas Deane Highway ([Route 99]) intersection, it becomes a freeway for the last . After a partial interchange with Interstate 91 (no direct access to I-91 South from Route 3 North), it crosses the Connecticut River on the William H. Putnam Memorial Bridge into Glastonbury.

The Route 3 designation was temporarily extended along this freeway pending completion of I-491. In 1973, I-491 was cancelled due to local opposition and the Route 3 designation along this freeway segment became permanent. In the late 1980s, the freeway was extended so that it terminated at Route 2, rather than at Main Street. =1991= In 1991, when the Route 9 freeway through Berlin and New Britain was completed, Route 72 was truncated to end at Route 9 in New Britain. The east-west portion of the old alignment of Route 72 was reassigned to an extended Route 372 (running along Berlin Road/West Street to end at Route 99 in Cromwell).

Together with the organisation's president Li JianChiu (ÊùéÂª∫Áßã), they set up their establishment of the federation in Beijing as the philanthropic branch of the Chinese salvationist religion Guiyidao (Áöà‰æùÈÅì), the \\"Way of the Return to the One\\".  Spiritual symbol  The swastika (Âçç w√†n; \\"infinity\\", \\"all\\") in Chinese and other cultures is a symbol of the universe, or the manifestation and creativity of God. It was one of a number of new transnational world redemptive societies founded in early 20th-century China, drawing upon Western examples such as the Red Cross to build charitable institutions grounded in Asian traditional religions. The use of the symbol in various Asian cultures predates and is not related to the symbol's use in Nazi iconography. Reports of its strength during the 1920s and 1930s seem to vary widely, with citations of 30,000 \\"members\\" in 1927 to 7‚Äì10 million \\"followers\\" in 1937.  Mission  Generally, its mission was a broad-based effort of philanthropy and moral education. It ran poorhouses and soup kitchens, as well as modern hospitals and other relief works. It had an explicit internationalist focus, extending relief efforts to Tokyo after earthquakes and also in response to natural disasters in the Soviet Union. In addition, it had offices in Paris, London, and Tokyo and professors of Esperanto within its membership.  Nanking Massacre  The Red Swastika in Hong Kong, Causeway Bay circa 2008 Perhaps its most documented impact on the history of China was its role in the Nanking Massacre. The rampage of the occupying Japanese forces through the city left thousands of bodies in the streets, and the Red Swastika Society stepped in to assist in burials. Records of these activities from the Red Swastika Society have provided important primary resources for research into the scale of the atrocity and the location of mass graves.  Present day  Although it seems to have been suppressed during the Maoist rule in mainland China, the Red Swastika Society continues today as a religious organisation focused on charity. It has branches in areas of the Chinese diaspora, with headquarters in Taiwan. Besides charity work, the Red Swastika runs two schools in Hong Kong (Tuen Mun and Tai Po) and one in Singapore (Red Swastika School).

An anime OVA, with two episodes, was released on December 8, 2005 in Japan. The anime OVA was licensed in the United States by Funimation, and was scheduled to be released in the USA on December 11, 2007. However, the video was recalled when it was discovered that, due to a misprint, the DVD was labeled TV-PG when it was intended to be TV-MA. Plot In the story, a girl called Mai appears before a boy who happens to dislike Christmas. As it turns out he was born on December 12 and thus was named Setani, causing him to hate the holiday. Moreover, as a child, he never had any festive occasions, such as birthday parties. With the power of Christmas, Mai is given the mission to improve his luck and change his views for the better. Characters ; (aka Set-chan) : : A lonely boy who dislikes Christmas. He is often teased for his odd name. As he grew up, his parents were never there for him. His view of Christmas changes when he meets Mai. ; : : A student at the Santa Claus Academy that has problems using her magic. She can only conjure up things that start with \\"set\\" („Çµ„É≥) in the Japanese language. She was sent to Set-chan to cheer him up as her mission but eventually falls in love with him in the process. Mai first appears to Set-chan as a junior high school student. Later when Set-chan starts to believe in Santa Claus, Mai gains enough Christmas powers to change into her grown-up form. In adult form, Mai oddly enough uses the hyper- masculine \\"Ore\\" (as opposed to the traditionally feminine \\"Atashi\\") when referring to herself, despite the feminine appeal that she gains with her transformation. ; (aka Shirley) (OVA anime only) : : Mai's best friend and rival. Unlike Mai, she is an elite in Santa Claus Academy. She says \\"Gorgeous\\" whenever she uses her magic, which can make any objects present to her grow to very large proportions. She was sent back to retrieve Mai in order for her to finish up her studies at the academy. ; (OVA anime only) : : Mai's little sister who came to live with Mai. She has the tendency to tag along with her big sister (onee-chan) wherever she goes. She also slaps anyone that interferes with her spending some time with her onee-chan. At the end of the OVA, it is revealed that Mai snuck away from the Santa Claus Academy and is, in fact, the one that Sharry was supposed to retrieve. ; (aka Miss Noel) (OVA anime only) : : A teacher from the Santa Claus Academy. She is the one that tells Mai that she has to say good-bye to Set-chan because she has to go back home and continue her studies.

History Catholicism in what is now the diocese dates back more than 250 years. Jesuit Father Joseph Greaton arrived in Philadelphia in 1729 and built Old St. Joseph Church, on Willings Alley at Fourth St. About 1732, he took charge of the West Jersey mission territory extending from Trenton to Cape May. A few years later, visits to the widely scattered Catholic families were recorded by Father Theodore Schneider, another Jesuit, who visited the iron furnaces in the southern part of the state in 1744. Traveling on horseback, by stagecoach and riverboat, the energetic Jesuit covered all of south and central Jersey, as well as parts of eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. When Schneider died in 1764, Father Ferdinand Steinmeyer, another Jesuit, succeeded him. Also known as Father Ferdinand Farmer, he traversed the state from Philadelphia to New York twice yearly visiting scattered Catholic families. He continued the ministry until his death in 1786. When the dioceses of New York and Philadelphia were established in 1808, West Jersey, the southern part, came under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishops of Philadelphia. When the Diocese of Newark was established in 1853, all of the state was in its jurisdiction. =First parish= About 1804, records show, Mass was celebrated in the printing office of Isaac Collins at Queen and Second Streets (now State and Broad Streets) in the heart of the Trenton business district. From 1811 to 1814, Mass was celebrated in the Federal St. home of John Baptist Sartori, a consular official who represented the commercial interests of the Papal States in Italy. When the number of Catholics coming to Mass became too much for the Sartori residence, it was decided to purchase land for a church to accommodate the growing congregation. With the encouragement of Michael Egan, the first bishop of Philadelphia, Sartori and John Hargous bought a plot at Lamberton and Market Streets. A small brick church was erected and dedicated to St. John in 1814. The congregation was the first Catholic parish in the state. Sometime later, a new parish church was built on South Broad Street. Following a devastating fire in 1883, a new church was erected and dedicated to the Sacred Heart. As the population of Trenton grew, new churches were built in Bordentown and Lambertville. In the 1860s, Father Anthony Smith saw the need for a new parish in the northern section of the city and, in 1865, purchased land where St. Mary Cathedral stands. The site of the Cathedral is the place where Col. Johann Gottlieb Rall, commander of the Hessian troops, had his headquarters in December 1776 during the Battle of Trenton. Construction of the church took five years, and it was dedicated by Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley of Newark on the Sunday of 1 January 1871. =Diocese established= In 1860, there were 25,000 Catholics in New Jersey, and by 1880 there were 130,000. In 1881, Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Trenton to serve the Catholics of the southern part of the state and named Father Michael J. O'Farrell of New York as its first bishop. At the time, the diocese had 68 churches, 23 parochial schools and 51 priests. New Jersey's Catholic population continued to grow with immigration from Italy and eastern Europe. By 1910 it had grown to 440,000, and by 1930 it had climbed to 1,050,000. In 1937, Pope Pius XI created the Diocese of Camden to serve Catholics in the six counties in the southern part of the state, under Bishop Bartholomew Eustace. The now smaller Diocese of Trenton had a Catholic population of 210,114 in eight counties with 212 diocesan priests, 121 parishes and 70 parochial schools. Much of the growth of the Catholic population in the Trenton Diocese took place during the episcopacy of Bishop George W. Ahr, from 1952 to his retirement, on 23 June 1979, an era in which the Catholic population grew to more than 800,000. Ahr established more than 50 new parishes and blessed more than 250 new buildings, including 100 new churches and parish centers and 90 schools and school additions. On 14 March 1956, in the midst of the tremendous growth, tragedy struck when fire destroyed St. Mary's Cathedral, claiming the lives of the rector, Msgr. Richard T. Crean, and two housekeepers. In a diocese that was growing and a world that was changing, Ahr took part in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council and guided implementation of the Council's decrees in the diocese. =Centennial= On 22 April 1980, John C. Reiss, who had been auxiliary bishop of the diocese since 1967, succeeded Ahr and led the celebration of the diocesan centennial in August 1981. Just a few months later, on 24 November 1980, the diocese, now with a Catholic population of 850,000, was divided again to establish the Diocese of Metuchen, which included the four northern counties of Middlesex, Somerset, Hunterdon and Warren. Following the split, the Diocese of Trenton had a population of 447,915 Catholics in Burlington, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties, with 119 parishes served by 193 diocesan priests and 105 religious priests. =Preparing for a New Millennium= After initiating the Emmaus program of priestly spirituality in 1982, Reiss implemented the Renew process for lay spirituality, which was intended to bring parishioners together in small faith-sharing groups in five seasons from 1985 through 1987. In 1986, Reiss approved a new vicariate structure for administration of the diocese. On 13 January 1991, he opened the Fourth Diocesan Synod during a Mass in St. Mary's Cathedral. It came 60 years after the Third Synod. On 30 June 1992, Reiss launched Faith-In-Service, a diocesan capital and endowment fund campaign, to try to ensure the financial stability of diocesan services. The campaign had a goal of $32 million and raised more than $38 million in gifts and pledges. In 1982, Msgr. Edward U. Kmiec, who had been master of ceremonies and secretary for Bishop Ahr and later for Bishop Reiss, was named auxiliary bishop of Trenton. Ten years later, Bishop Kmiec was appointed Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee. On 21 November 1995, John M. Smith was named Coadjutor Bishop of Trenton, to eventually succeed Reiss as bishop of the diocese. Smith, a native of the Newark Archdiocese and a former Auxiliary Bishop of Newark, at the time was Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee, Florida. On reaching the age of 75, Reiss submitted his letter of retirement to Pope John Paul II. The letter was accepted, effective July 1, 1997, and that day Smith became Chief Shepherd of the Diocese of Trenton. =A New Era= In his 13 years leading the Diocese of Trenton, Bishop John M. Smith is responsible for fostering numerous initiatives that have served the people of the diocese and beyond. Following the call of Pope John Paul II to place ever-advancing communications technologies at the service of the Gospel, Bishop Smith oversaw the diocese's establishment of an Internet presence with the launch of the diocesan website (www.dioceseoftrenton.org) in 2000. He also championed the diocese's newly created teen talk show, Realfaith TV, which is televised and webcast throughout North America and has garnered numerous prestigious awards. That online presence has grown significantly in the decade that followed, with specially targeted websites for the diocese's Hispanic Apostolate; Ministry of Vocations; the sanctity of human life with (www.respectlifetoday.com) and, most recently, The Monitor online (www.TrentonMonitor.com). Bishop Smith has also shepherded the diocese toward new ways to be Church in response to new and changing realities. As part of the call to empower the laity and prepare lay men and women for ministry in the diocese, Bishop Smith created the Institute for Lay Ecclesial Ministry, which has formed and commissioned 110 individuals to date. In order that parishes might be more effective and engaging in their ministry and outreach to their parishioners and the wider community, particularly in response to population changes and a declining number of priests, Bishop Smith set forth \\"The 11 Elements of a Vibrant Parish\\" in 2000 and launched a consultative study process in the years that followed in support of those ideals. The study gave rise to parish restructuring that reduced the number of parishes to 111 to date, and pointed to areas of interparochial cooperation and collaboration to enhance their ability to serve the shared needs of their people. With declining enrollment in some Catholic schools, Bishop Smith also called for a strategic planning process to determine the best ways to preserve Catholic education in the diocese for generations to come. In January 2006, Bishop Smith announced the \\"Commitment to Excellence\\" initiative and action plan that enumerated new measures in school leadership, marketing and financial management, and benchmarks that schools needed to achieve in enrollment, class size and curriculum development. Although many schools were still thriving and operating on a waiting list, his mission to suburbanize the Diocese of Trenton remained undeterred. Bishop Smith effectively closed every Catholic school in Trenton to the detriment of the community, Catholic education and, the city of Trenton. In August 2009, Bishop Smith officially inaugurated and promulgated a new diocesan pastoral plan, \\"Led By the Spirit,\\" the result of nearly two years of consultation with Catholics throughout the diocese. The plan identifies seven pastoral priorities‚Äîdealing with charity and justice, pastoral leadership, ethnic diversity, youth and young adult ministry, faith formation and Sunday worship - and resulted in a restructuring of the diocesan administrative structure that better supports the priorities. Since the promulgation, all parishes have been engaged in developing action plans in service to \\"Led By the Spirit.\\" =Present Time= Co-Cathedral of St. Robert Bellarmine in Freehold On June 4, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI named Vincentian Father David M. O'Connell, C.M., president of The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. as coadjutor bishop of Trenton. As required by Church law, Bishop John M. Smith submitted his resignation to the Holy See on June 23, his 75th birthday. Bishop O'Connell was consecrated to the episcopacy for the Diocese of Trenton on July 30 by Bishop John M. Smith in St. Mary of the Assumption Cathedral, Trenton. Bishop David M. O'Connell, C.M., became the new bishop on Dec. 1, 2010. Bishop O'Connell has as his episcopal motto \\"Ministrare non Ministrari\\" which means \\"To serve and not to be served\\" Bishops The following is a list of Bishops of Trenton and their years of service:Go to and click on \\"Bishops of Trenton\\". =Bishops of Trenton= # Michael J.

By 2020, the names of 43 accused clergy who served in the Diocese of Trenton were made public.https://bishop-accountability.org/member/psearch.jsp Some of those accused were arrested and convicted. On February 9, 2020, it was reported that all five Catholic dioceses across the state of New Jersey, which includes the Diocese of Trenton, had paid over $11 million to compensate 105 claims of sex abuse committed by Catholic clergy. Of these 105 claims, 98 were compensated through settlements. The payments also do not involve 459 other sex abuse cases in these dioceses which are still not resolved.https://kywnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/price-tag-for-priest- sex-abuse-in-nj-11-million-and-up The same month, it was also revealed that since 2005, the Diocese of Trenton worked with the Archdiocese of Newark and Diocese of Metuchen in a scheme which involved paying victims of former Cardinal, Archbishop of Newark, and Bishop of Metuchen Theodore McCarrick.

It is located in the DeSales Corner business district, along Madison Road. Purcell Marian is a Roman Catholic, co-educational high school serving a multi-racial student body of many faiths with differing backgrounds and educational needs. It is chartered by the state of Ohio and accredited by North Central Association of Schools. Urban in its environment, it is supervised by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and administered and staffed by lay and religious, primarily the Society of Mary and the Sisters of Charity. , enrollment is 326 students. For sports the Cavaliers compete in the Greater Catholic League. Purcell High School Purcell High School began in 1928 as an Archdiocesan High School for young men. The site was originally purchased in 1924 by the Rt. Reverend Msgr. J. Henry Schengber for the parish of St. Francis de Sales. Under the direction of the Most Reverend Henry Moeller (Archbishop of Cincinnati) plans were drawn up for a high school which was to occupy the site of the present day Walnut Hills High School. In 1928, the Most Reverend John T. McNicholas decided to locate the school on Hackberry Street and gave it the name Purcell, in honor of the first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, John Baptist Purcell. Purcell High School was under the administration of the Brothers of Mary and was staffed by Brothers, Marianist Priests, and lay men and women. The Eveslage Athletic Center was dedicated in 1971. In 2020, it was revealed that at least four Marian clergy who served at the school had been accused of committing acts of sex abuse. Marian High School Marian High School began in 1908 as a co-educational parish school ‚Äì the first school of its type in Cincinnati. It was named St. Marys and was located at St. Mary Parish in Hyde Park. For years the high school shared facilities with the elementary school in the building that had been erected in 1903 as St. Mary Mission Chapel. A new St. Mary High School was constructed in 1923. In 1928, St. Mary became a diocesan regional high school for girls only. The boys who had been enrolled there were transferred to the new Purcell High School. In 1963, a new high school called Marian High School was under the administration of the Sisters of Charity and was staffed by Sisters, Archdiocesan Priests, and lay men and women. (This building now houses The Springer School, on Madison Road in O'Bryonville.) Merger to Form Purcell Marian In 1980 the decision was made to merge both schools and the name changed to Purcell Marian High School. Purcell High School and Marian High School merged beginning with the 1981-82 school year. The name of the new school would be Purcell Marian High School. It would be located at the Purcell site and begin with the 1981-82 school year. The mascot would be the Cavalier, and the school's colors would be Crimson, Blue and Gold. The school seal shows the picture of the Blessed Virgin and Child. The inscription includes the school's motto, Praestans Inter Omnes, and the date of foundation. Academics The curriculum is accredited by the Ohio Department of Education and the Ohio Catholic School Accrediting Association. Purcell Marian has recently adopted a new method of \\"blended\\" learning using a combination of online and class taught curriculum for the 2013-14 school year. The program so far includes mathematics and is expected to expand to other subjects in the near future.

In 1219 he confirmed as heir-apparent all his father's grants to the abbey, and after his accession as earl around 1223, he made a vow never to disturb the monks in their possessions.

As a Baptist, he is a long- standing member of the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America and the Fellowship of Reconciliation. As a conscientious objector to military service, he worked in a hospital in the early 1950s, which stimulated his interest in medical physics. He has been involved with the \\"Peace Zone\\" at the annual Greenbelt Festival.Christian peacemakers bring their message to Greenbelt https://www.indcatholicnews.com/news/14715 He became internationally known in 2005 when, as a member of a delegation of Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) in Iraq, he was taken hostage with three other CPT members, leading to a widely publicised hostage crisis. He stated that his reasons for going to Iraq were to demonstrate his opposition to the invasion of the country by the United States-led coalition and to show solidarity with the Iraqi people. Kidnap and release On 26 November 2005, Kember (a delegate) and three other Western peace workers with CPT (American Tom Fox and Canadians James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden) were kidnapped by a previously unknown group calling itself the Swords of Righteousness Brigade. According to his family, Kember went to Iraq to help Iraqis. Kember's family said: \\"Norman‚Äôs recent trip to visit the people of Iraq serves to highlight his willingness to listen to people from all backgrounds, beliefs, and walks of life and his determination to promote equality amongst all people.\\" \\"He has gone to Iraq to listen, not convert; to learn from the Iraqi people, not to impose values; to promote peace and understanding.\\" On 5 December 2005 Kember's wife made a plea for his release. Her 30-second plea was shown on Arab broadcast station Al Jazeera. A 10 December deadline was set by the kidnappers for the release of all Iraqi prisoners, or the hostages would be executed. It passed without any word on the hostages' fate. As the deadline passed, and with no news of his whereabouts, his friends held an hour-long silent vigil for him in Trafalgar Square, London. A further vigil was held by local dignitaries and friends at Harrow Civic Centre. Two weeks later, with the Kember family still waiting to hear news, they set up a telephone line, hoping that the kidnappers would contact them. On 28 January 2006 a new video was released by his captors and shown on Al-Jazeera television. They stated that this was the \\"last chance\\" for their demands to be met. On 5 March vigils were held in Trafalgar Square to mark 100 days since Kember was taken hostage. and on March 7 a new tape of Kember was aired on Arab satellite television station al-Jazeera. Three days later, the body of Kember's American colleague Tom Fox was found. On 23 March Kember and the others were freed during a raid by multinational forces led by British Special Forces. None of the captors were present at the time of the raid, no shots were fired and no-one was injured. Professor Kember himself assumes that the non-violent manner of his release was a result of a previous campaign to get hold of one of his captors who obviously uncovered the address of the place in return for allowance to inform his comrades that they should stay away from the place. Kember was repeatedly criticised for his response toward the military forces involved in his release. He refused to provide military intelligence with any information regarding his captors. He also requested the withdrawal of coalition forces from Iraq. On 24 March General Sir Michael Jackson told Channel 4 News that he was \\"saddened that there doesn't seem to have been a note of gratitude for the soldiers who risked their lives to save those lives\\". On 25 March, in a telephone phone-in discussion on BBC Radio 5 Live, Colonel Bob Stewart, a former British Commander under United Nations command in Bosnia from September 1992 to May 1993 suggested that Mr Kember and people like him were a liability, since he had ignored advice not to go to Baghdad and the security services, the British government and multinational forces had diverted valuable time and resources to rescue a \\"foolish, albeit well-intentioned, meddling civilian\\". His alleged lack of gratitude was criticised as not being characteristic of true Christian values. He arrived back in the United Kingdom on 25 March and released a written statement saying \\"I do not believe that a lasting peace [in Iraq] is achieved by armed force, but I pay tribute to their (the armed forces) courage and thank those who played a part in my rescue\\". Later that day he also released a video statement in which he again thanked his rescuers, and those who had supported his family throughout his kidnapping. A public interview with Professor Kember was recorded at the Greenbelt Christian Arts Festival at Cheltenham in August 2006. https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/talks/an-interview- with-norman-kember-hosted-by-canon-lucy-winkett/ Kember wrote an account of his kidnapping, Hostage in Iraq, which was published in 2007pub.Darton,Longman & Todd Ltd ISBN: 9780232526998. He himself considers it an irony that he travelled to Iraq to oppose the military intervention and was flown out of Baghdad in a military helicopter, guarded by machine guns. He also is discussing whether his peace testimony has been compromised and what alternatives would have been at hand. In lectures and interviews, Kember states that what saddens him is the fact that he is alive and well, while people in Iraq, servicemen as well as civilians, are constantly threatened and many have meanwhile lost their lives. =Pleas for his release= Many individuals and groups asked for Kember's release; including: Terry Waite, radical Islamic cleric Abu Qatada, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, and Briton Moazzam Begg, a former detainee at the Guantanamo Bay prison. Arrest of kidnappers On 7 November 2006 Iraqi government troops arrested individuals suspected of involvement in the kidnap and imprisonment of Norman Kember. The same day, Kember released a statement in which he refused to testify against them.Kember court testimony 'unlikely' Hostage in Iraq A year after his dramatic release by a multinational military raid, Norman Kember revealed his story behind the controversy of his captivity in Baghdad in his book Hostage in Iraq. Writing for The Guardian newspaper, Kember praised his captors' conduct, stating that \\"I am almost surprised that we were treated so moderately by our captors ‚Äì apart, that is, from the tragic, largely unexplained, decision to kill Tom Fox, the American Quaker.\\" Kember provides bail for Abu Qatada In May 2008 Kember controversially provided bail security for the release of Abu Qatada. Qatada, who requested the release of Kember, entered the UK using a forged passport but was allowed to remain in the UK on appeal under the British Human Rights Act 1998 and European Convention on Human Rights, despite suspected continued terrorist involvement, and was held in prison until his release by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.

It was the first full-length work regarding Chaitanya Mahaprabhu written in Bengali language and documents his early life and role as the founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. The text details Chaitanya's theological position as a combined Avatar of both Radha and Krishna within the belief of his close associates and followers. The writing of Chaitanya Bhagavata was commissioned by Nityananda, who was the guru of Vrindavana Dasa Thakura and close friend of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Name Initially, the Chaitanya Bhagavata was named Chaitanya Mangala. Krishnadasa Kaviraja also mentioned this work by this name. According to the Premavilasa of Narottama Dasa, when it was discovered that the poet Lochana Dasa had also written a work with this title, the leading members of the Vaishnava community in Vrindavan met and decided that Vrindavana Dasa's book would be known as the Chaitanya Bhagavata with Lochana Dasa's book remaining as the Chaitanya Mangala.Sen, Sukumar (2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas (in Bengali), Vol.I, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , p.261 Divisions The Chaitanya Bhagavata is divided into three parts: the Adi-khanda, Madhya-khanda and Antya-khanda: ;Adi-khanda The Adi-khanda consists of sixteen adhyayas (chapters). It deals with the socio-religious situation of Bengal before the advent of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, his birth, education, and marriage to Lakshmi- priya; his defeating opposing scholars, his visit to East Bengal, the passing of Lakshmi-priya, his marriage to Vishnupriya and his trip to Gaya and subsequent initiation from Ishvara Puri. ;Madhya-khanda The Madhya-khanda consists of twenty-seven adhyayas (chapters). It narrates Chaitanya's growing external displays of devotion, the disciples which join his devotional creed, the conversion of the debauchees Jagai and Madhai, and Chaitanya's civil disobedience movement against the Muslim Chand Kazi who tries to stop the congregational chanting of the names of Krishna. ;Antya-khanda The Antya- khanda consists of ten adhyayas (chapters). It portrays Chaitanya's acceptance of sannyasa (the renounced order), his mother Saci-Mata's lamentation, his travels to Puri, his meeting with the logician Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and his relationships and interactions with different devotees. In two of the manuscripts of the Chaitanya Bhagavat, three additional chapters are found at the end of the Antya-khanda, which are not accepted as the part of the original text by most of the modern scholars.Sen, Sukumar (2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas (in Bengali), Vol.I, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , p.269 Importance The Chaitanya Bhagavata (similarly to the Chaitanya Charitamrita) asserts that Chaitanya was not simply a saint or even a \\"regular\\" Avatar, but was instead the direct incarnation of Krishna as Bhagavan, or the Supreme God himself. The text gives Chaitanya's mission as one for the benefit of mankind, through beginning the yuga-dharma (harinam- sankirtana) for the present age of Kali Yuga. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoted within as saying \\"My holy name will be sung (preached) in every town and village of earth\\".p·πõthivƒ´-parjanta jata ƒÅche de≈ùa-grƒÅma sarvatra sa√±cƒÅra hoibek mora nƒÅma, C.Bh. Antya 4.126 The author, Vrindavana Dasa, has been considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas to be the Vyasa of Chaitanya's pastimes because of revealing his true nature and mission. The Bhagavata has been praised for its simplicity in that is does not cross into the ontological nuances that are found in Krishna Dasa Kaviraja's Chaitanya Charitamrita. The Charitamrita of Krishna Dasa gives a more sophisticated and theological view of the life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and provides more information on his years in Puri as an ascetic. Together, the texts of the Chaitanya Bhagavata and the Chaitanya Charitamrta provide a complete picture of the life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu although there are many more of his biographies and other writingsVedic Encyclopedia, Library about him. Scholars are of the opinion that Vrindavana Dasa wrote the Chaitanya Bhagavata somewhere in the mid-1540s.

It is a secluded enclave on the original Thorney Island, now shared between Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster, and unsuspected by millions of Londoners who pass nearby between Westminster and Victoria. To the East is College Garden (which refers to the collegiate body of Westminster Abbey, and not only to the school), the oldest cultivated garden in England, and formerly the infirmary garden of the monastery. Beyond is the Victoria Tower of the Palace of Westminster, which towers over the Yard. The chimes of Big Ben mark every quarter of every hour. The entrance to the great School, formerly the monks' reredorter, is a stone arch designed by Lord Burlington. A stone path marks the original way, before the rest of Yard was paved, to the low stone tunnel under another row of monastic buildings which leads to Dean's Yard, cars, and the outside world. On the North side of Yard is Ashburnham House, built by Inigo Jones or his pupil John Webb, on the site of the mediaeval Prior's House, parts of which can still be seen. The bricks show the signs of impatient schoolchildren drilling away with coins while awaiting the opening of the school tuck-shop. A wide archway leads through the Dark Cloister to the Abbey, and the school gym. On the South, three Georgian houses accommodate Rigaud's and Grant's houses, and that of the Master of the Queen's Scholars.

The most prominent proponent is Ronald Dworkin, who advances the view in Law's Empire and Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution. Alternatively, it can be taken to mean a constitution that defines the fundamental political principles and establishes the power and duties of each government, and does so while being consistent with a moral code. The moral code can take any of the same forms as the constitution itself: written, unwritten, codified, uncodified, etc. Former Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, also wrote his book on \\"The Court of Ethics and Constitutional Ethics\\" (2014) advocating a new perspective on the 'rule of ethics' besides the doctrine of the 'rule of law'. This interpretation of the Constitution intends to create a change in the application of law and in particular Constitutional Law from a rule of law paradigm to a morality-based paradigm, and would require the explanation and description of the moral code as a principle of operation of the government specified in the constitution as a fundamental component of its structure. The description of a rule of morality, or moral code can come in two forms. It can be a set of rules, such as the biblical Ten Commandments, and is the form of most legal systems of government today. Alternatively, it can be a set of principles, or a moral code. This alternative definition of a concept of a Moral Constitution finds its only current example in the Bill of Morals efforts of the present government of South Africa.

He is among the best known playwrights of the Black Arts Movement. Early life and education Bullins was born July 2, 1935 in Philadelphia. He was born to Bertha Marie Queen and Edward Bullins, and was raised primarily by his mother. As a child, he attended predominantly white schools and became involved with gangs. He attended Franklin High School, where he was stabbed in a gang-related incident. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of high school and joined the navy. During this period, he won a boxing championship, began to read, returned to Philadelphia, and enrolled in night school.

In 1964, he moved to San Francisco and joined the creative writing program at San Francisco State College, where he started writing plays. Bullins' first play was How Do You Do, immediately followed by Clara's Ole [Old] Man and Dialect Determinism. Black House and Black Panthers After seeing Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman, Bullins felt that Baraka's artistic purpose was similar to his own.Sanders, Leslie. \\"Ed Bullins (1935- ).\\" Afro-American Writers After 1955: Dramatist and Prose Writers, volume 38. Edited by Thadious M. Davis and Trudier Harris. Detroit: Gale, 1985. 43-61. He joined Baraka at Black House, the Black Arts Movement's cultural center, along with Sonia Sanchez, Huey Newton, Marvin X, and others. The Black Panthers used Black House as their base in San Francisco, where Bullins served temporarily as their Minister of Culture in producing theater as protest. Black House eventually split into two opposing factions: one group considered art to be a weapon and advocated joining with whites to achieve political ends, while the other group considered art to be a form of cultural nationalism and didn't want to work with whites. Bullins was a part of the latter group. New Lafayette Players Robert Macbeth, the director who took the trilogy to The American Place Theatre, contemporary crew member read Bullins' plays and asked him to join the New Lafayette Players, a new theatrical group in Harlem. The first production the New Lafayette Players performed was a trilogy called The Electronic Nigger and Others. The trilogy earned Bullins a Drama Desk Award for 1968. The trilogy's title was later changed to Ed Bullins Plays for what Bullins called \\"financial reasons\\". Bullins worked with the Lafayette Players until 1972, when the group ended due to lack of funding. During these years, ten of Bullins' plays were produced by the Players, including In the Wine Time and Goin' a Buffalo. 1970s-1990s After Bullins left the New Lafayette Players, he and his family remained in the Bronx. Several of his plays were produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the early 1970s.

In 1973, he was playwright-in-residence at the American Place Theatre. From 1975-1983, he was on staff at the Public Theater with the New York Shakespeare Festival's Writers' Unit. During these years, Bullins wrote two children's plays, titled I am Lucy Terry and The Mystery of Phillis Wheatley. He also wrote the text for two musicals, titled Sepia Star and Storyville. Bullins later returned to school, and received a bachelor's degree in English and Playwriting from Antioch University in San Francisco. In 1995, he became a professor at Northeastern University, where he is currently a distinguished Artist-in-Residence. Other work In addition to Bullins' playwriting, he wrote short stories and novels, including The Hungered One and The Reluctant Rapist. The Reluctant Rapist features Bullins' alter ego, Steve Benson, who appears in many of Bullins' works. Criticism Many critics praised his early work, but others thought his plays were too violent and negatively depicted African-Americans. One critique of his work questioned whether black writers should challenge revolutionary activity without providing alternative directions and resolutions. Many black critics rallied to defend Bullins, criticizing white critics for using traditional white notions of good drama to evaluate black theatre. Awards Bullins has received numerous awards for his playwriting.http://www.bridgesweb.com/blacktheatre/bullins.html He has twice received the Black Arts Alliance Award, for The Fabulous Miss Marie and In the New England Winter. In 1971, Bullins won the Guggenheim Fellowship for playwriting. He received an Obie Award for distinguished playwriting for The Taking of Miss Janie in 1975, which also received a New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Also in 1975, he won the Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award, four Rockefeller Foundation playwriting grants, and two National Endowment for the Arts playwriting grants. In 2012, Bullins received the Theatre Communications Group Visionary Leadership Award.

The second part of the saga relates the adventures of Gunnarr helmingr and his interaction with a cult of Freyr in Sweden. Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where people still bl√≥ted to Freyr. The Swedes had appointed a young and beautiful woman to serve the fertility god, and Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, and then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.

Although the normalization model was initially developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex, normalization is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions, including the representation of odors in the olfactory bulb , the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value, and the integration of multisensory information.

It was the original name of the \\"Reflective Optical Videodisc System\\" format later known as \\"LaserVision\\" or LaserDisc. Description MCA DiscoVision Inc. was a division of entertainment giant MCA (Music Corporation of America), established in 1969 to develop and sell an optical videodisc system. MCA released discs pressed in Carson and Costa Mesa, California on the DiscoVision label from the format's Atlanta, Georgia launch in 1978 to 1982 and the release of the film, The Four Seasons. DiscoVision titles included films from Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Disney content. Agreements were made with Columbia Pictures and United Artists, though no discs were released on the DiscoVision label from either studio. Most of these companies later established their own labels for the format, the first being Paramount with a dozen movies released on the Paramount Home Video label in the summer of 1981. The successor to MCA DiscoVision, DiscoVision Associates (DVA) was the result of a partnership between IBM and MCA. It was hoped that the merger would provide the basis for improvement of the quality of DiscoVision pressings, but no appreciable improvement ever took hold. In 1981, responsibility for the laser videodisc was sold to Pioneer Electronic Corporation. Pioneer, in association with MCA, had a disc replication facility in Kofu, Japan that produced discs. Some of the last DiscoVision label discs were manufactured by Pioneer in Japan. In the same year, MCA had an abrupt failure from its DiscoVision system and was replaced by MCA Videodisc; this was changed to the \\"MCA Home Video\\" name for both its VHS and videodisc releases. DiscoVision Associates later evolved into a patent holding company which manages and licenses intellectual property related to LaserDisc, Compact Disc, and optical disc technologies, as well as other non-disc related fields. In 1989, Pioneer acquired DiscoVision Associates where it continues to license its technologies independently. DiscoVision's license activities covered LaserDisc, CD, DVD and other optical disc products. A lawsuit in Delaware made it clear that DiscoVision's patent (David Paul Gregg was the inventor) is the basic blocking patent of the CD format. As the portfolio of patent expires, the presence of DiscoVision become less visible. However, it established the success of a patent holding company, which other companies are stimulated to generate royalty income from their own patent portfolio.

Smart environments include smart homes, smart cities and smart manufacturing. Introduction Smart environments are an extension of pervasive computing. According to Mark Weiser, pervasive computing promotes the idea of a world that is connected to sensors and computers. These sensors and computers are integrated with everyday objects in peoples' lives and are connected through networks. Definition Cook and Das define smart environment as \\"a small world where different kinds of smart device are continuously working to make inhabitants' lives more comfortable.\\" Smart environments aim to satisfy the experience of individuals from every environment, by replacing the hazardous work, physical labor, and repetitive tasks with automated agents. Poslad differentiates three different kinds of smart environments for systems, services and devices: virtual (or distributed) computing environments, physical environments and human environments, or a hybrid combination of these: * Virtual computing environments enable smart devices to access pertinent services anywhere and anytime. * Physical environments may be embedded with a variety of smart devices of different types including tags, sensors and controllers and have different form factors ranging from nano- to micro- to macro-sized. * Human environments: humans, either individually or collectively, inherently form a smart environment for devices. However, humans may themselves be accompanied by smart devices such as mobile phones, use surface-mounted devices (wearable computing) and contain embedded devices (e.g., pacemakers to maintain a healthy heart operation or AR contact lenses). Features Smart environments are broadly classified to have the following features # Remote control of devices, like power line communication systems to control devices. # Device Communication, using middleware, and Wireless communication to form a picture of connected environments. # Information Acquisition/Dissemination from sensor networks # Enhanced Services by Intelligent Devices # Predictive and Decision-Making capabilities Technologies To build a smart environment, involves technologies of # Wireless communication # Algorithm design, signal prediction & classification, information theory # Multilayered software architecture, Corba, middleware # Speech recognition # Image processing, image recognition # Sensors design, calibration, motion detection, temperature, pressure sensors, accelerometers # Semantic Web and knowledge graphs # Adaptive control, Kalman filters # Computer networking # Parallel processing # Operating systems Existing projects The Aware Home Research Initiative at Georgia Tech \\"is devoted to the multidisciplinary exploration of emerging technologies and services based in the home\\" and was launched in 1998 as one of the first \\"living laboratories.\\" The MavHome (Managing an Adaptive Versatile Home) project, at UT Arlington, is a smart environment-lab with state-of-the-art algorithms and protocols used to provide a customized, personal environment to the users of this space. The MavHome project, in addition to providing a safe environment, wants to reduce the energy consumption of the inhabitants. Other projects include House_n at the MIT Media Lab and many others.

He was the son of Robert, 4th Earl of Strathearn. Biography Malise first appears on record in 1244, when he promised to observe the Treaty of York, the signing of which had been witnessed by his father. By this treaty, the King of Scots had dropped his claims to the northern shires of England. He was present in parliament from 1244 to 1245, and took part in the coronation of King Alexander in 1249. He was a friend of King Henry of England, and was tasked by him to attend his daughter Margaret, when she became Queen of Scots as the wife of Alexander. In 1259 he obtained safe conduct from King Henry to go abroad, and had returned the following year. Malise was an intelligent figure who managed to retain the favor of both the Scottish and English kings. Said to have been \\"munificent above all his compatriots\\", he was also much noted for his generosity. Throughout his life he made considerable gifts to Inchaffray Abbey, giving the monks command of several of his serfs, and the right to take stone from the quarry of Nethergask, as well as donating several monetary sums. Death and burial Malise is believed to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, there was a picture in the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.

Discovered in 1963 by Salvatore Bellini and rediscovered in 1975 by Richard Blakemore, this alignment is believed to aid these organisms in reaching regions of optimal oxygen concentration. To perform this task, these bacteria have organelles called magnetosomes that contain magnetic crystals. The biological phenomenon of microorganisms tending to move in response to the environment's magnetic characteristics is known as magnetotaxis. However, this term is misleading in that every other application of the term taxis involves a stimulus-response mechanism. In contrast to the magnetoreception of animals, the bacteria contain fixed magnets that force the bacteria into alignment‚Äîeven dead cells are dragged into alignment, just like a compass needle.Dusenbery, David B. (1996). ‚ÄúLife at Small Scale‚Äù, pp. 100-101. Scientific American Library, New York. .  Introduction  The first description of magnetotactic bacteria was in 1963 by Salvatore Bellini of the University of Pavia. While observing bog sediments under his microscope, Bellini noticed a group of bacteria that evidently oriented themselves in a unique direction. He realized these microorganisms moved according to the direction of the North Pole, and hence called them \\"magnetosensitive bacteria\\". The publications were academic (peer-reviewed by the Istituto di Microbiologia's editorial committee under responsibility of the Institute¬¥s Director Prof. L. Bianchi, as usual in European universities at the time) and communicated in Italian with English, French and German short summaries in the official journal of a well-known institution, yet unexplainedly seem to have attracted little attention until they were brought to the attention of Richard Frankel in 2007. Frankel translated them into English and the translations were published in the Chinese Journal of Oceanography and Limnology. Richard Blakemore, then a microbiology graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, working in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in whose collections the pertinent publications of the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Pavia were extant, observed microorganisms following the direction of Earth's magnetic field. Blakemore did not mention Bellini's research in his own report, which he published in Science, but was able to observe magnetosome chains using an electron microscope. Bellini's terms for this behavior, namely , or , and (Bellini's first publication, last page), went forgotten, and Blakemore's \\"magnetotaxis\\" was adopted by the scientific community. These bacteria have been the subject of many experiments. They have even been aboard the Space Shuttle to examine their magnetotactic properties in the absence of gravity, but a definitive conclusion was not reached. The sensitivity of magnetotactic bacteria to the Earth's magnetic field arises from the fact these bacteria precipitate chains of crystals of magnetic minerals within their cells. , all magnetotactic bacteria are reported to precipitate either magnetite or greigite. These crystals, and sometimes the chains of crystals, can be preserved in the geological record as magnetofossils. The oldest unambiguous magnetofossils come from the Cretaceous chalk beds of southern England, though less certain reports of magnetofossils extend to 1.9 billion years old Gunflint chert. There have also been claims of their existence on Mars based on the shape of magnetite particles within the Martian meteorite ALH84001, but these claims are highly contested.Cat Faber, Living Lodestones: Magnetotactic bacteria , Strange Horizons, 2001  Biology  Several different morphologies (shapes) of MTB exist, differing in number, layout and pattern of the bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs) they contain. The MTBs can be subdivided into two categories, according to whether they produce particles of magnetite () or of greigite (), although some species are capable of producing both. Magnetite possesses a magnetic moment with three times the magnitude of greigite. Magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria are usually found in an oxic-anoxic transition zone (OATZ), the transition zone between oxygen-rich and oxygen-starved water or sediment. Many MTB are able to survive only in environments with very limited oxygen, and some can exist only in completely anaerobic environments. It has been postulated that the evolutionary advantage of possessing a system of magnetosomes is linked to the ability to efficiently navigate within this zone of sharp chemical gradients by simplifying a potential three-dimensional search for more favorable conditions to a single dimension. (See for a description of this mechanism.) Some types of magnetotactic bacteria can produce magnetite even in anaerobic conditions, using nitric oxide, nitrate, or sulfate as a final acceptor for electrons. The greigite mineralizing MTBs are usually strictly anaerobic. It has been suggested MTB evolved in the early Archean Eon, as the increase in atmospheric oxygen meant that there was an evolutionary advantage for organisms to have magnetic navigation. Magnetosomes first evolved as a defense mechanism in response to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that resulted from the Great Oxygenation Event. Organisms began to store iron in some form, and this intracellular iron was later adapted to form magnetosomes for magnetotaxis. These early MTB may have participated in the formation of the first eukaryotic cells. Biogenic magnetite similar to that found in magnetotactic bacteria has been also found in higher organisms, from euglenoid algae to trout. Reports in humans and pigeons are far less advanced. Magnetotactic bacteria organize their magnetosomes in linear chains. The magnetic dipole moment of the cell is therefore the sum of the dipole moment of each BMP, which is then sufficient to passively orient the cell and overcome the casual thermal forces found in a water environment. In the presence of more than one chain, the inter-chain repulsive forces will push these structures to the edge of the cell, inducing turgor. Nearly all of the genes relevant to magnetotaxis in MTB are located in an approximately 80 kilobase region in the genome called the magnetosome island. There are three main operons in the magnetosome island: the mamAB operon, the mamGFDC operon, and the mms6 operon. There are 9 genes that are essential for the formation and function of modern magnetosomes: mamA, mamB, mamE, mamI, mamK, mamM, mamO, mamP, and mamQ. In addition to these 9 genes that are well conserved across all MTB, there are more than 30 total genes that contribute to magnetotaxis in MTB. These non-essential genes account for the variation in magnetite/greigite crystal size and shape, as well as the specific alignment of magnetosomes in the cell. The diversity of MTB is reflected by the high number of different morphotypes found in environmental samples of water or sediment. Commonly observed morphotypes include spherical or ovoid cells (cocci), rod-shaped (bacilli), and spiral bacteria of various dimensions. One of the more distinctive morphotypes is an apparently multicellular bacterium referred to as the many-celled magnetotactic prokaryote (MMP). Regardless of their morphology, all MTB studied so far are motile by means of flagella and are gram-negative bacteria of various phyla. Despite the majority of known species' being proteobacteria, e.g. Magnetospirillum magneticum an alphaproteobacterium, members of various phyla possess the magnetosome gene cluster, such as Candidatus Magnetobacterium bavaricum, a Nitrospira. The arrangement of flagella differs and can be polar, bipolar, or in tufts. The first phylogenetic analysis on magnetotactic bacteria using 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons was performed by P. Eden et al. in 1991. Another trait that shows considerable diversity is the arrangement of magnetosomes inside the bacterial cell. In the majority of MTB, the magnetosomes are aligned in chains of various lengths and numbers along the cell's long axis, which is magnetically the most efficient orientation. However, dispersed aggregates or clusters of magnetosomes occur in some MTB, usually at one side of the cell, which often corresponds to the site of flagellar insertion. Besides magnetosomes, large inclusion bodies containing elemental sulfur, polyphosphate, or poly-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate are common in MTB. The most abundant type of MTB occurring in environmental samples, especially sediments, are coccoid cells possessing two flagellar bundles on a somewhat flattened side. This \\"bilophotrichous\\" type of flagellation gave rise to the tentative genus \\"Bilophococcus\\" for these bacteria. In contrast, two of the morphologically more conspicuous MTB, regularly observed in natural samples, but never isolated in pure culture, are the MMP and a large rod containing copious amounts of hook-shaped magnetosomes (Magnetobacterium bavaricum).  Magnetism  The physical development of a magnetic crystal is governed by two factors: one is moving to align the magnetic force of the molecules in conjunction with the developing crystal, while the other reduces the magnetic force of the crystal, allowing an attachment of the molecule while experiencing an opposite magnetic force. In nature, this causes the existence of a magnetic domain, surrounding the perimeter of the domain, with a thickness of approximately 150nm of magnetite, within which the molecules gradually change orientation. For this reason, the iron is not magnetic in the absence of an applied field. Likewise, extremely small magnetic particles do not exhibit signs of magnetisation at room temperature; their magnetic force is continuously altered by the thermal motions inherent in their composition. Instead, individual magnetite crystals in MTB are of a size between 35 and 120nm, that is; large enough to have a magnetic field and at the same time small enough to remain a single magnetic domain. The MTB polarity model The inclination of the Earth's magnetic field in the two respective hemispheres selects one of the two possible polarities of the magnetotactic cells (with respect to the flagellated pole of the cell), orienting the biomineralisation of the magnetosomes. Aerotaxis is the response by which bacteria migrate to an optimal oxygen concentration in an oxygen gradient. Various experiments have clearly shown that magnetotaxis and aerotaxis work in conjunction in magnetotactic bacteria. It has been shown that, in water droplets, one-way swimming magnetotactic bacteria can reverse their swimming direction and swim backwards under reducing conditions (less than optimal oxygen concentration), as opposed to oxic conditions (greater than optimal oxygen concentration). The behaviour that has been observed in these bacterial strains has been referred to as magneto-aerotaxis. Two different magneto-aerotactic mechanisms‚Äîknown as polar and axial‚Äîare found in different MTB strains. Some strains that swim persistently in one direction along the magnetic field (either north-seeking [NS] or south-seeking [SS])‚Äîmainly the magnetotactic cocci‚Äîare polar magneto- aerotactic. These magnetotactic bacteria will travel along the lines of the earth's magnetic field according to their orientation, but will swerve as a group and reverse direction if exposed to a local, more powerful and oppositely-oriented magnetic field. In this way, they continue to travel in the same magnetic direction, but relative instead to the local field. Those MTB that swim in either direction along magnetic field lines with frequent, spontaneous reversals of swimming direction without turning around‚Äîfor example, freshwater spirilla‚Äîare axial magneto-aerotactic and the distinction between NS and SS does not apply to these bacteria. The magnetic field provides both an axis and a direction of motility for polar magneto-aerotactic bacteria, whereas it only provides an axis of motility for axial types of bacteria. In both cases, magnetotaxis increases the efficiency of aerotaxis in vertical concentration gradients by reducing a three-dimensional search to a single dimension. Scientists have also proposed an extension of the described model of magneto-aerotaxis to a more complex redoxtaxis. In this case, the unidirectional movement of MTB in a drop of water would be only one aspect of a sophisticated redox-controlled response. One hint for the possible function of polar magnetotaxis could be that most of the representative microorganisms are characterised by possessing either large sulfur inclusions or magnetosomes consisting of iron-sulfides. Therefore, it may be speculated the metabolism of these bacteria, being either chemolithoautotrophic or mixotrophic, is strongly dependent on the uptake of reduced sulfur compounds, which occurs in many habitats only in deeper regions at or below the OATZ due to the rapid chemical oxidation of these reduced chemical species by oxygen or other oxidants in the upper layers. Microorganisms belonging to the genus Thioploca, for example, use nitrate, which is stored intracellularly, to oxidize sulfide, and have developed vertical sheaths in which bundles of motile filaments are located. It is assumed that Thioploca uses these sheathes to move efficiently in a vertical direction in sediment, thereby accumulating sulfide in deeper layers and nitrate in upper layers. For some MTB, it might also be necessary to perform excursions to anoxic zones of their habitat to accumulate reduced sulfur compounds. Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum bacteria with black magnetosome chains visible Magnetosomes The biomineralisation of magnetite () requires regulating mechanisms to control the concentration of iron, the crystal nucleation, the redox potential and the acidity (pH). This is achieved by means of compartmentalisation in structures known as magnetosomes that allow the biochemical control of the above-mentioned processes. After the genome of several MTB species had been sequenced, a comparative analysis of the proteins involved in the formation of the BMP became possible. Sequence homology with proteins belonging to the ubiquitous cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family and the \\"Htr-like\\" serine proteases has been found. While the first group is exclusively dedicated to the transport of heavy metals, the second group consists of heat shock proteins (HSPs) involved in the degradation of badly folded proteins. Other than the serine protease domain, some proteins found in the magnetosomial membrane (MM) also contain PDZ domains, while several other MM proteins contain tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. = TPR domain = The TPR domains are characterized by a folding consisting of two Œ±-helices and include a highly conserved consensus sequence of 8 amino acids (of the 34 possible), which is the most common in nature. Apart from these amino acids, the remainder of the structure is found to be specialised in relation to its functional significance. The more notable compounds that comprise TPR domains include: # membrane-bound transport complexes conveying proteins within mitochondria and/or peroxisomes # complexes that recognise DNA-binding proteins and repress DNA transcription # the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Examples of both the TPR-TPR interactions, as well as TPR-nonTPR interactions, have been reported. =PDZ domain= The PDZ domains are structures that consist of 6 Œ≤-filaments and 2 Œ±-helices that recognise the C-terminal amino acids of proteins in a sequence- specific manner. Usually, the third residue from the C-terminal is phosphorylated, preventing interaction with the PDZ domain. The only conserved residues in these structures are those involved in the recognition of the carboxy terminal. PDZ domains are quite widespread in nature, since they constitute the basic structure upon which multiproteinic complexes are assembled. This is especially true for those associated with membrane proteins, such as the inward rectifier K+ channels or the Œ≤2-adrenergic receptors. =Membrane and proteins= The formation of the magnetosome requires at least three steps: #Invagination of the magnetosome membrane (MM) # Entrance of magnetite precursors into the newly formed vesicle # Nucleation and growth of the magnetite crystal During the first formation of an invagination in the cytoplasmic membrane is triggered by a GTPase. It is supposed this process can take place amongst eukaryotes, as well. The second step requires the entrance of ferric ions into the newly formed vesicles from the external environment. Even when cultured in a Fe3+ deficient medium, MTB succeed at accumulating high intracellular concentrations of this ion. It has been suggested that they accomplish this by secreting, upon need, a siderophore, a low-molecular-weight ligand displaying an elevated affinity for Fe3+ ions. The \\"Fe3+-siderophore\\" complex is subsequently moved in the cytoplasm, where it is cleaved. The ferric ions must then be converted into the ferrous form (Fe2+), to be accumulated within the BMP; this is achieved by means of a transmembrane transporter, which exhibits sequence homology with a Na+/H+ antiporter. Furthermore, the complex is a H+/Fe2+ antiporter, which transports ions via the proton gradient. These transmembrane transporters are localised both in the cytoplasmic membrane and in the MM, but in an inverted orientation; this configuration allows them to generate an efflux of Fe2+ ions at the cytoplasmic membrane, and an influx of this same ion at the MM. This step is strictly controlled by a cytochrome-dependent redox system, which is not yet fully explained and appears to be species-specific. During the final stage of the process, the magnetite crystal nucleation is by action of transmembrane proteins with acidic and basic domains. One of these proteins, called Mms6, has also been employed for the artificial synthesis of magnetite, where its presence allows the production of crystals homogeneous in shape and size. It is likely that many other proteins associated with the MM could be involved in other roles, such as generation of supersaturated concentrations of iron, maintenance of reducing conditions, oxidisation of iron, and partial reduction and dehydration of hydrated iron compounds. =Biomineralisation= Several clues led to the hypothesis that different genetic sets exist for the biomineralisation of magnetite and greigite. In cultures of Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, iron can not be replaced with other transition metals (Ti, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Hg, Pb) commonly found in the soil. In a similar manner, oxygen and sulfur are not interchangeable as nonmetallic substances of the magnetosome within the same species. From a thermodynamic point of view, in the presence of a neutral pH and a low redox potential, the inorganic synthesis of magnetite is favoured when compared to those of other iron oxides.Potential-pH diagrams for iron oxides in water It would thus appear microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions create a suitable potential for the formation of BMPs. Moreover, all iron absorbed by the bacteria is rapidly converted into magnetite, indicating the formation of crystals is not preceded by the accumulation of intermediate iron compounds; this also suggests the structures and the enzymes necessary for biomineralisation are already present within the bacteria. These conclusions are also supported by the fact that MTB cultured in aerobic conditions (and thus nonmagnetic) contain amounts of iron comparable to any other species of bacteria. Symbiosis with other species Symbiosis with magnetotactic bacteria has been proposed as the explanation for magnetoreception in some marine protists. Research is underway on whether a similar relationship may underlie magnetoreception in vertebrates as well. Biotechnology applications In certain types of applications, bacterial magnetite offers several advantages compared to chemically synthesized magnetite. Bacterial magnetosome particles, unlike those produced chemically, have a consistent shape, a narrow size distribution within the single magnetic domain range, and a membrane coating consisting of lipids and proteins. The magnetosome envelope allows for easy couplings of bioactive substances to its surface, a characteristic important for many applications. Magnetotactic bacterial cells have been used to determine south magnetic poles in meteorites and rocks containing fine-grained magnetic minerals and for the separation of cells after the introduction of magnetotactic bacterial cells into granulocytes and monocytes by phagocytosis. Magnetotactic bacterial magnetite crystals have been used in studies of magnetic domain analysis and in many commercial applications including: the immobilisation of enzymes; the formation of magnetic antibodies, and the quantification of immunoglobulin G; the detection and removal of Escherichia coli cells with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated monoclonal antibody, immobilised on magnetotactic bacterial magnetite particles; and the introduction of genes into cells, a technology in which magnetosomes are coated with DNA and \\"shot\\" using a particle gun into cells that are difficult to transform using more standard methods. However, the prerequisite for any large-scale commercial application is mass cultivation of magnetotactic bacteria or the introduction and expression of the genes responsible for magnetosome synthesis into a bacterium, e.g., E. coli, that can be grown relatively cheaply to extremely large yields. Although some progress has been made, the former has not been achieved with the available pure cultures.

It was developed by the company's Production Studio 4, and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. Containing science fiction and comedy elements, the main character of the game's story is an extraterrestrial named Cosmi, sent from Planet Mischief to Earth to generally wreak havoc. The game features cameos from some of the cast of one of Capcom's other games, such as an entire level that functions as a parody of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Plot The story revolves around the Planet Mischief, where there is a tradition that once someone turns 3-years old, he or she must travel to a planet and learn how to perform \\"Mischief\\" and cause panic on that planet. Cosmi, a three-year- old alien, travels to Earth for his mission, in order to impress his father, the Master of Mischief, Cosmi Sr., mostly because Earth is considered the greatest challenge. Cosmi crashes with a TV satellite from a town called Coco Town. When crash landing, he manages to hide in an alley on Coco Town, where he is saved by Earth's Mischief Master, Master Itazura. He takes him to his Dojo to train, and lets Cosmi move on with his mission, on 8 different locations: Coco Town, High Stakes Hill, Pranksylvania, Pharaoh Island, Big Booty Bay, Frontiersville, Raccoon City and finally Cosmopolis. It is revealed that Cosmopolis is a trap for \\"Anti-Alien-Forces\\" to capture all of the aliens on Earth by disguising themselves as aliens. Itazura uses their trap as the final challenge for Cosmi, and challenges him personally there. Cosmi wins and travels back to Planet Mischief to celebrate, but crashes into another TV- station and crashlands on Earth again, this time, in the middle of Coco Town square. Of course, panic arises and reporters try to get a snapshot of the little alien, but Cosmi accidentally pushes someones camera around, causing it to take a photo of the crowd, thus revealing that several of them are also aliens. Gameplay Since Cosmi is vulnerable in his small alien form, he must first beam up a nearby earthling in order to create a disguise for himself. Once he has beamed a person up, he can change his form by stepping under a UFO. Each earthling has a different ability that can be used for causing mischief, such as boomboxes, vacuum cleaners or bazookas. Successfully knocking over earthlings yields coins that are required to complete the goals set in each level. Once pranked, the earthlings will become hostile towards Cosmi and try to attack him. While disguised, Cosmi can take two hits, the first leaving him in underwear (a possible homage to Ghosts 'n Goblins), while the second one reverts him to his vulnerable alien form. Earthlings will continue to chase and attack Cosmi, forcing him to lose coins, until he can find another UFO to change into another disguise. At certain points in the level, a Panic Time will occur where something crazy in the stage happens for a short amount of time. Characters Cosmi: The son of Cosmi. Sr, he considers himself to be a pro in mischief, even though he's clumsy and arrogant. He can transform himself into Super-Cosmi by using a special item. He thinks that Master Itazura should cool it down about worrying about him. Becky: The self-proclaimed friend of Cosmi. Cosmi considers her more of a nuisance rather than a friend, considering her obsession to be with him (and pulling pranks on him). She looks similar to Cosmi, but with white skin, blonde jelly-like hair with two snail-like eyes on top (which might mean that her hair is alive as well), a red dress, red boots, a red lady hat and white pants under her dress. She can teleport with a special item. But in the end, she becomes egotistical and demands that everyone should love her. Mumphy: He is quite the lovely baby of his family, and has not left his planet until now. His nickname is the \\"Ball of fire\\", which fits his appearance well. He is a robe-clad ball with eyes and a mouth, with pink skin colour and a feather on top. He is quite literally a hothead considering his special item that causes volcanic eruptions. In the end, his mother reveals that he is adopted, and shows him a picture of his real mother. Baron von Proptop: A vagabond of all trades, he travels from world to world to see new life and new civilisations but collapses from exhaustion when reaching Earth. He is saved by a friendly nun, and taken care of by her. He finds out that they suffer from an economical crisis so Proptop decides to thank the nun by winning the contest and giving the prize money to them. He wears a tall French-polis hat, with a propeller on top, a red scarf, goggles, green-jumpsuit with large sleeves etc. His special item causes everyone to tie themselves up and drop coins. In the end, he wins and returns to the nuns, leaving the money to them and continuing his travels without having them see him. The nun hears his propeller for the last time... Princess Cleo: A princess from her own world. She has never had a boyfriend and enters all kinds of competitions to raise her fame. Finally she enters the Mischief tests to try and raise her fame again. She looks like a mermaid with pink fish skin on her tail, pink hair, a very oddly shaped crown, a white trenchcoat and a human face. She can summon a UFO whenever she wants. In the end, she finds true happiness from witnessing Earth's vast oceans, and decides to spend her entire life in the sea. Magnetron: A genius in mechanics. He creates a large machine, which he operates called \\"Magnetron\\" for the contest. He himself is a small green blob with only one eye, a catlike mouth and a shell on top of his head. His robot has horns, goggles, a large clunky blue body, magnets for hands and small legs, and he can use a special item to drag in every coin for a time-limit. In the end, his success leads to the mass-production of his robots, and he becomes wealthy. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

'The zone of proximal development, often abbreviated as ZPD (zona blizhaishego razvitiia, in original Russian), is best understood as the zone of the closest, most immediate psychological development of the children that includes a wide range of their emotional, cognitive, and volitional psychological processes.The Problem of Age. in The Collected Works of L. S. Vygotsky, Volume 5, 1998, pp. 187-205 The difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of proximal development. Combination of these two indexes provides a more informative indicator of psychological development than assessment of actual development alone.Chaiklin, S. (2003). \\"The Zone of Proximal Development in Vygotsky's analysis of learning and instruction.\\" In Kozulin, A., Gindis, B., Ageyev, V. & Miller, S. (Eds.)

Dynamic Assessment in Practice: Clinical And Educational Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.xiii-xiv In Practice Dynamic assessment is an interactive approach to psychological or psychoeducational assessment that embeds intervention within the assessment procedure. Most typically, there is a pretest then an intervention and then a posttest. This allows the assessor to determine the response of the client or student to the intervention. There are a number of different dynamic assessment procedures that have a wide variety of content domains. There are two major approaches to DA: Interactionist and Interventionist approaches. Interventionist approach is implemented in two formats: sandwich and cake formats.

The company is based in Ironton, Ohio. Once a major player in the fast food industry, Rax has extensively scaled down its operations since its peak in the 1980s. Its closest rival in terms of menu offerings is Arby's. History and operations Rax was originally known as JAX Roast Beef, founded by Jack Roschman in 1967, in Springfield, Ohio. In 1969, Roschman sold the chain to General Foods, who then changed the name of the restaurants to RIX Roast Beef. General Foods ran the chain until 1978, when most of the restaurants closed down. The remaining 10 units were franchised units owned by the Restaurant Administration Corporation (RAC), headed by J. Patrick Ross, a franchisee of multiple restaurant chains including Wendy's, Ponderosa Steak House, and Long John Silver's. RAC purchased the remainder of RIX from General Foods, and returned the JAX name to the restaurants. RAC eventually decided to focus on the roast beef business, and began franchising the chain. The JAX restaurants were renamed Rax to be more suitable for trademarking and franchising, with the first Rax branded franchise restaurant opening in Columbus, Ohio. RAC was renamed Rax Systems Inc., then again to Rax Restaurants Inc. in 1982. By then, Rax had grown to over 221 restaurants in 25 states. In 1981, the chain introduced baked potatoes and salad bars to its menu. By June 1984, the 300th location was opened in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1988, the company decided to reduce the size of its money losing salad and food bars to help reduce expenses and refocus on sandwiches. An older Rax, as shown in 2007, still in operation in Lancaster, Ohio. This location was later featured on an episode of Pittsburgh Dad.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E06ZpclNi50 At its peak in the 1980s, the Rax chain had grown to 504 locations in 38 states along with two restaurants in Guatemala, and two restaurants in Canada. The Canadian locations were in Lethbridge and Red Deer, Alberta. During this time, Rax began diversifying its core roast beef sales by adding baked potatoes, pizza and a dinner bar with pasta, Chinese-style food, taco bar, an \\"Endless Salad Bar\\", and a dessert bar. Rax began to transform its restaurants from basic restaurant architecture into designs containing wood elements and solariums, with the intention of becoming the \\"champagne of fast food\\". This transformation drove away its core working class customers, blurred its core business, and caused profits to plunge for Rax as others took advantage of Rax's techniques and improved on them, as Wendy's did. Compounding the decline was a management buyout of the company in 1991 and numerous changes that occurred on the company board. The company attempted to convert under-performing outlets by forming joint ventures with Miami Subs and Red Burrito as they scaled back many of its stand-alone locations to its core markets, particularly in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. A new advertising campaign was formulated with Deutsch Inc. to create Mr. Delicious in order to attract adult customers. The new advertising campaign backfired, causing the exit of the marketing team. This, along with compounding loan payments, forced the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 1992. A former Rax Restaurant in Vermilion, Ohio. In 1994, Rax Restaurants Inc. merged with North Carolina-based Franchise Enterprises Inc, renaming the company Heartland Food Systems Inc., and becoming a Hardee's franchisee. Heartland planned to convert all Rax restaurants into Hardee's by 1997. However, by 1996, the difficulty of converting Rax restaurants to Hardee's placed too much pressure on Heartland, and they were forced to once again file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As part of a turnaround plan, the company sold the Hardee's units it owned that were not originally Rax stores and changed the company's name back to Rax Restaurants Inc. The company was planning a revival for the Rax concept, including a new, simpler menu, a new store prototype, and a new logo and color scheme. However, in November 1996, Wendy's International made an offer to purchase 37 Rax restaurants, intending to convert most of them to Tim Hortons. This caused a change in strategy, and a buyer was sought for the remaining company-owned restaurants. In July 1997, the Rax brand was purchased by Cassady & Associates. As other fast food chains added kids' meals, Rax created its mascot, Uncle Alligator, who was dominant in all kids‚Äô meals and toys, always involving some sport or activity (e.g. skateboarding). In 2006, there were 26 locations remaining in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. In December 2007, Rich Donohue, a franchise owner with a restaurant in Ironton, Ohio, purchased the Rax trademark. The new company, From Rax to Rich's Inc., purchased the name to bypass licensing costs, and had plans to open more restaurants in Ohio and Kentucky. The last Rax in Indiana closed in 2011. By February 2015, there were 15 locations in Illinois, Kentucky, and Ohio, and West Virginia. The last Rax in West Virginia closed in 2016 and the number of locations declined to eight by March 2016. Around 2017, at least two Long John Silver's locations (both in Ohio, in Georgetown and West Union) added smaller Rax menus. Both locations have since shut down. Current status From Rax to Rich's Inc. owns the two locations in Lancaster, Ohio and Ironton. Most of the remaining Rax locations are franchisee-owned, with the right to use the Rax name as long as the store is in operation and the chain has shrunk to eight locations, six in Southern Ohio, and one each in Kentucky and Illinois.

He was the son of Malise II and his second wife Matilda, daughter of Gilbert, Earl of Orkney and Caithness. He succeeded his father on the latter's death in 1271, though for some reason he does not refer to himself as Earl until 1283, perhaps because he had not been formally infeft in the earldom. Malise helped to keep the Kingdom of Scotland stable after the death of King Alexander, and in an example of his behaviour, he is recorded as levying the tenants of the land belonging to Inchaffray Abbey to help preserve the peace. In 1284 he had joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret, Maid of Norway as the heir to Alexander. In the interregnum following Margaret's death, Malise took a prominent part in state affairs, and was involved in most of the political events of the time. Perhaps because of his marriage into the House of Comyn, he took the side of John Balliol in his competition for the throne with Robert Bruce, and accompanied John at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296. Later he swore fealty to Edward I of England, and two of his sons were taken as hostages by that king, to ensure their father's good behaviour. In 1297 he took the Earl of Fife's uncle as a prisoner for King Edward, along with his two sons. A close friend of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward II), he was invested in 1305 as Lieutenant of the Warden north of the Forth. In 1306 he was ordered to take the sons of the Steward of Scotland and the Earl of Atholl as hostages, but before he could complete this task, he was imprisoned in Rochester Castle because of his alleged surrender to King Robert Bruce. According to Malise, King Robert and the Earl of Atholl had marched into Strathearn and deceived and coerced him into paying Robert homage. Notwithstanding this explanation, he remained imprisoned. On petition from the Earl's wife and sons, King Edward ordered an inquiry to be made, but nothing came of this. After having been transferred to York in 1307, he was finally acquitted and set free in 1310. Malise was present on the English side when King Robert stormed Perth Castle in 1312. He died later the same year, and was entombed in Inchaffray Abbey, to the right of the high altar. Marriage and issue The Earl married a lady named Agnes, likely the second daughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan. The Countess Agnes would later be imprisoned for life for conspiring against King Robert with her nephew William Soules. Malise and Agnes had three sons and a daughter: *Malise IV, succeeded as Earl *Gilbert, went with King Edward to Flanders in 1297, and may have died or been killed there *Robert, is recorded as having been imprisoned in the Tower of London with other Scottish youths in 1297.

About 70 different chemicals have been used or stockpiled as chemical weapon agents during the 20th century. These agents may be in liquid, gas or solid form. In general, chemical weapon agents are organized into several categories according to the physiological manner in which they affect the human body. Division may also be by tactical purpose or chemical structure. The names and number of categories varies slightly from source to source, but in general, types of chemical warfare agents are as follows: Harassing agents These are substances that are not intended to kill or injure. They are often referred to as Riot Control Agents (RCAs) and may be used by civilian police forces against criminals and rioters, or in the military for training purposes. These agents also have tactical utility to force combatants out of concealed or covered positions for conventional engagement, and preventing combatants from occupying contaminated terrain or operating weapons. In general, harassing agents are sensory irritants that have fleeting concentration dependent effects that resolve within minutes after removal. Casualty effects are not anticipated to exceed 24-hours nor require medical attention. =Tear agents= These sensory irritants produce immediate pain to the eyes and irritate mucous membranes (aka lachrymatory agent or lachrymator). * Benzyl chloride * Benzyl bromide * Bromoacetone (BA) * Bromobenzylcyanide (CA) * Bromomethyl ethyl ketone * Capsaicin (OC) * Chloracetophenone (MACE; CN) * Chloromethyl chloroformate * Dibenzoxazepine (CR) * Ethyl iodoacetate * Ortho-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (Super tear gas; CS) * Trichloromethyl chloroformate * Xylyl bromide =Vomiting agents= These sensory irritants are also termed sternators or nose irritants. They irritate the mucous membranes to produce congestion, coughing, sneezing, and eventually nausea. * Adamsite (DM) * Diphenylchloroarsine (DA) * Diphenylcyanoarsine (DC) =Malodorants= These are compounds with a very strong and unpleasant smell, which produce powerfully aversive effects without the toxic effects of tear agents or vomiting agents. Incapacitating agents These are substances that produce debilitating effects with limited probability of permanent injury or loss of life. The casualty effects typically last over 24 hours, and though medical evacuation and isolation is recommended, it is not required for complete recovery. These, together with harassing agents, are sometimes called nonlethal agents. There may be as high as 5% fatalities with the use of these agents. =Psychological agents= These are substances that produce casualty effects through mental disturbances such as delirium or hallucination. * 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ) * Phencyclidine (SN) * Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) =Other incapacitating agents= These substances have also been investigated as incapacitants, though they operate more through interactions outside the central nervous system. *KOLOKOL-1 (tranquilizer) Lethal agents These substances are for producing chemical casualties without regard to long-term consequences or loss of life. They cause injuries that require medical treatment. = Blister agents = A blister agent is a chemical compound that irritates and causes injury to the skin. These substances also attack the eyes, or any other tissue they contact. Vesicants The vesicants are substances that produce large fluid-filled blisters on the skin. =Nitrogen mustards= * Bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine (HN1) * Bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine (HN2) * Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine (HN3) =Sulfur mustards= * 1,2-Bis(2-chloroethylthio) ethane (Sesquimustard; Q) * 1,3-Bis(2-chloroethylthio)-n-propane * 1,4-Bis(2-chloroethylthio)-n-butane * 1,5-Bis(2-chloroethylthio)-n-pentane * 2-Chloroethylchloromethylsulfide * Bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide (Mustard gas; HD) * Bis(2-chloroethylthio) methane * Bis(2-chloroethylthiomethyl) ether * Bis(2-chloroethylthioethyl) ether (O Mustard; T) =Arsenicals= * Ethyldichloroarsine (ED) * Methyldichloroarsine (MD) * Phenyldichloroarsine (PD) * 2-Chlorovinyldichloroarsine (Lewisite; L) Urticants The urticants are substances that produce a painful weal on the skin. These are sometimes termed skin necrotizers and are known as the most painful substances produced. *Phosgene oxime (CX) = Blood agents = These substances are metabolic poisons that interfere with the life-sustaining processes of the blood. * Cyanogen chloride (CK) * Hydrogen cyanide (AC) * Arsine (SA) =Choking agents= These substances are sometime referred to as pulmonary agent or lung irritants and cause injury to the lung-blood barrier resulting in Asphyxia. * Chlorine (CL) * Chloropicrin (PS) * Diphosgene (DP) * Phosgene (CG) = Nerve agents = Nerve agents are substances that disrupt the chemical communications through the nervous system. One mechanism of disruption, utilized by the G, GV, and V series of chemicals is caused by blocking the acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that normally destroys and stops the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Poisoning by these nerve agents leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine at the nerve axon, producing a perpetual excited state in the nerve (e.g. constant muscle contraction). The eventual exhaustion of muscles leads to respiratory failure and death. A separate class of nerve agents are related to Tetrodotoxin, frequently abbreviated as TTX, is a potent neurotoxin with no known antidote. Tetrodotoxin blocks action potentials in nerves by binding to the voltage-gated, fast sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, essentially preventing any affected nerve cells from firing by blocking the channels used in the process. G series These are high volatility nerve agents that are typically used for a nonpersistent to semipersistent effect. * Tabun (GA) * Sarin (GB) * Soman (GD) * Cyclosarin (GF) GV series These agents have a volatility between the V and G agents and are typically used for a semi-persistent to persistent effect. * Novichok agents *GV (nerve agent) V series These agents have low volatility and are typically used for a persistent effect or liquid contact hazard. * VE * VG * VM * VX T series These agents are related to the puffer fish * Tetrodotoxin * Saxitoxin (TZ) Other * Botulinum toxin Category:Chemical weapons ","title":"List of chemical warfare agents"},{"id":"3382514","text":"Bernard Budiansky (8 March 1925 ‚Äì 23 January 1999) was a renowned scholar in the field of applied mechanics, and made seminal contributions to the mechanics of structures and mechanics of materials.JR Rice (2008) Bernard Budiansky 1925-1999: A Memorial Tribute, National Academy of Sciences.J Arbocz and J Singer (2000) Professor Bernard Budiansky's contributions to buckling and post-buckling of shell structures.

Upon obtaining a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from City College of New York in 1944 when he was barely over 19, he became an aeronautical research scientist at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner to NASA) at Langley Field, Virginia. He took an educational leave from NACA to enroll in 1947 in the graduate program in Applied Mathematics at Brown University, completing his Ph.D. in 1950 with a dissertation entitled Fundamental Theorems and Consequences of the Slip Theory of Plasticity. He returned to Langley in 1950 and, in 1952, was appointed Head of the Structural Mechanics Branch. He joined the faculty of Harvard in 1955. He made widely cited contributions on the way that fissures and joints in rocks affect the propagation of seismic waves, which has become a standard basis for inferring rock properties in the Earth, and contributed to understanding stressing and deformation in the inflation of the human lung. His work of the later years was focused on problems in the domain of materials science, explaining mechanical properties of solids in terms of microscopic mechanisms. He referred to this important area as \\"micromechanics\\". He was one of its pioneers, and contributed to explanation of the fracture of ductile metals and the toughening of normally brittle ceramics and composite materials.

Johnston played 209 games and kicked 283 goals for the Carlton Football Club (the Blues), in a career spanning 1979‚Äì1990. He was inducted into the Carlton Football Club Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2018, Johnston was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Playing career After playing junior football in Wandin, Johnston attracted the attention of Victorian Football Association recruiters; in 1975, after being rejected by Oakleigh because it already had a number of rovers on its playing list, he signed to play for Prahran. Johnston played for Prahran from 1975 until 1978, and was part of their 1978 premiership winning team. Under VFL zone laws in those days, in 1979 Johnston asked to be cleared to play for the Melbourne Football Club; but he was part of Carlton's zone, and coach Alex Jesaulenko wanted to see him play before axing him. He debuted in the first game of the 1979 season against the Essendon Bombers. Johnston impressed, and became a vital member of the 1979 premiership side. He could play either across the half-forward line or in the centre. He was the recipient of the Carlton Best and Fairest award, the John Nicholls Medal (at that time called the Robert Reynolds Trophy), first in 1983 and then in 1986, when he tied with Craig Bradley. Johnston was made captain of the Blues from 1984‚Äì1985, and his presence was critical in high-pressure games and especially finals. He played in the Carlton premiership sides of 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1987. For 1991, Johnston was signed by struggling SANFL club Sturt and was regarded as a key recruit in the hope of improving the Double Blues from only two wins in 1990, but injuries meant he played just three games for the Double Blues before injury ended his playing career and he was sacked ten weeks before the SANFL minor round ended.Lysikatos, John; True blue: the history of the Sturt Football Club, pp. 312-313. Personal life With his first wife Debbie Johnston, has four surviving children. A fifth, Matt, died in 1999 from an asthma attack. After retiring from football, he moved to Brisbane in 1993, where, among other jobs, he worked as a wharfie. He stayed connected with football, however, and for a time coached the Mt Gravatt Vultures in the AFL Queensland South-East Premier League. Following the breakup of his marriage, Johnston and family moved back to Melbourne; there he found a new love, actress Kate Kendall, and they married on 28 November 2004. Johnston returned to the AFL environment and served as a runner for two seasons for Richmond. His sons are also keen footballers. One of his sons, Marc, currently plays for Sandringham in the VFL.

A choke usually consists of a coil of insulated wire often wound on a magnetic core, although some consist of a doughnut-shaped \\"bead\\" of ferrite material strung on a wire. The choke's impedance increases with frequency. Its low electrical resistance passes both AC and DC with little power loss, but its reactance limits the amount of AC passed. The name comes from blocking‚Äî\\"choking\\"‚Äîhigh frequencies while passing low frequencies. It is a functional name; the name \\"choke\\" is used if an inductor is used for blocking or decoupling higher frequencies, but the component is simply called an \\"inductor\\" if used in electronic filters or tuned circuits. Inductors designed for use as chokes are usually distinguished by not having the low- loss construction (high Q factor) required in inductors used in tuned circuits and filtering applications.  Types and construction  MF or HF radio choke for tenths of an ampere, and a ferrite bead VHF choke for several amperes. ferrite \\"bead\\" choke, consisting of a cylinder of ferrite encircling a computer power cord to block electronic noise. Chokes are divided into two broad classes: * Audio frequency chokes (AFC) ‚Äì designed to block audio and power line frequencies while allowing DC to pass * Radio frequency chokes (RFC) ‚Äì designed to block radio frequencies while allowing audio and DC to pass. = Audio frequency choke = Audio frequency chokes (AFC) usually have ferromagnetic cores to increase their inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. The iron core increases the inductance for a given volume of the core. Chokes were frequently used in the design of rectifier power supplies for vacuum tube equipment such as radio receivers or amplifiers. They are commonly found in direct-current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were used in conjunction with large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores. Some car audio hobbyists use choke coils with car audio systems (specifically in the wiring for a subwoofer, to remove high frequencies from the amplified signal). = Radio frequency choke = Radio frequency chokes (RFC) often have iron powder or ferrite cores which increases inductance and overall operation. They are often wound in complex patterns (basket winding) to reduce self-capacitance and proximity effect losses. Chokes for even higher frequencies have non-magnetic cores and low inductance. A modern form of choke used for eliminating digital RF noise from lines is the ferrite bead, a cylindrical or torus-shaped core of ferrite slipped over a wire. These are often seen on computer cables. A typical RF choke value could be 2 millihenries. = Common-mode choke = A typical common-mode choke configuration. The common mode currents, I1 and I2, flowing in the same direction through each of the choke windings, creates equal and in-phase magnetic fields which add together. This results in the choke presenting a high impedance to the common mode signal. The common-mode (CM) choke, where two coils are wound on a single core, is useful for suppression of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) from power supply lines and for prevention of malfunctioning of power electronics device. It passes differential currents (equal but opposite), while blocking common-mode currents.http://www.murata.com/products/emc/knowhow/pdf/26to30.pdf The magnetic flux produced by differential-mode (DM) currents in the core tend to cancel each other out since the windings are negative coupled. Thus, the choke presents little inductance or impedance to DM currents. Normally this also means that the core will not saturate for large DM currents and the maximum current rating is instead determined by the heating effect of the winding resistance. The CM currents, however, see a high impedance because of the combined inductance of the positive coupled windings. CM chokes are commonly used in industrial, electrical and telecommunications applications to remove or decrease noise and related electromagnetic interference. When the CM choke is conducting CM current, most of the magnetic flux generated by the windings is confined with the inductor core because of its high permeability. In this case, the leakage flux, which is also the near magnetic field emission of the CM choke is low. However, the DM current flowing through the windings will generate high emitted near magnetic field since the windings are negative coupled in this case. To reduce the near magnetic field emission, a twisted winding structure can be applied to the CM choke. Measurement experiment set up The difference between the balanced twisted windings CM choke and conventional balanced two winding CM choke is that the windings interact in the center of the core open window. When it is conducting CM current, the balanced twisted winding CM inductor can provide identical CM inductance as the conventional CM inductor. When it is conducting DM current, the equivalent current loops will generate inversed direction magnetic fields in space so that they tend to cancel each other. A current is passed through inductor, and a probe measures the near field emission. A signal generator, serving as a voltage source, is connected to an amplifier. The output of the amplifier is then connected to the inductor under measurement. To monitor and control the current flowing through the inductor, a current clamp is clamped around the conducting wire. An oscilloscope connected to the current clamp to measures the current waveform. A probe measures the flux in the air. A spectrum analyzer connected to the probe collects data.

He was an ardent supporter of King Robert the Bruce, in contrast to his father, Malise III, who sided with Edward I of England. He is first recorded in January 1306, when he and his mother petitioned King Edward to release his father, who had been mistakenly imprisoned. In 1309 he is noted as having received gifts of money and wine from Edward; nevertheless, he joined King Robert's side, and fought with him at the siege of Perth Castle in 1312, while his father fought for the English defenders. On the fall of the castle, the elder Malise was captured by his son, who then took control of the earldom of Strathearn. Little more is known of him, as his name does not often appear on record. He was one of the earls who signed the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, and married at least twice. Though the identity of his first wife is not known, we know that by her he had a son and a daughter: Malise, who succeeded his father as eighth Earl, and Mary or Maria, who married John de Moray of Drumsargard. His second wife, whom he married around 1323, was Jean or Joanna, daughter of Sir John Menteith of Ruskie. They had no issue. After the Earl's death around 1329, the Dowager Countess would go on to marry three more times. Her third husband, Maurice Murray, was granted the earldom of Strathearn after it was lost by the eighth Earl.  Ancestry  Bibliography *The Scots Peerage, ed.

First published in 1956, it was Shaw's third novel, following The Young Lions and The Troubled Air. Principal Characters * Lucy Crown, wife and mother * Oliver Crown, her husband * Anthony (Tony) Crown, their son * Jeffrey Bunner, Lucy's lover Plot summary Lucy, an orphan, marries Oliver, a successful but frustrated businessman. Oliver's ambitions are thwarted when his father dies and Oliver is forced to run the family business. He proves to be a controlling husband. Lucy, who suffers from self-esteem issues, is intimidated by him and gives up her career aspirations. In the summer of 1937, Oliver leaves Lucy (now age 35) and son Tony (age 13) alone at a lake resort for several weeks while he attends to business. During Oliver's absence Lucy is pursued by Jeffrey, a Dartmouth College undergraduate they have hired to be a companion for Tony. She resists Jeffrey's advances but they eventually begin what Lucy regards as a casual affair. Tony sees them having intercourse and tells his father, who confronts the couple. Lucy and Oliver remain married, but she insists that she will have nothing further to do with her son. Tony becomes embittered and cuts off all contact with his mother. Lucy's deliberate act of infidelity and betrayal leads to the disintegration of her marriage and complete estrangement from her son. During World War II, Tony is unable to serve in the military due to poor health. Oliver joins the U.S. Army and is away from home for several years. Lucy embarks on a series of affairs with other men during Oliver's absence. Before leaving for combat in Europe, a despondent Oliver attempts to explain his frustrations and unhappiness to his son: ‚Ä≥You reach a certain age, say twenty-five, thirty, it varies with your intelligence, and you begin to say, ‚ÄúOh, Christ, this is for nothing. You begin to realize it‚Äôs just more of the same, only getting worse every day... I used to have a high opinion of myself... and then, in fifteen minutes in a little stinking summer resort beside a lake, the whole thing collapsed.‚Ä≥ A decade after the war is over, Lucy (now aged 60) visits Paris and unexpectedly encounters her son. She learns that he is married with a son, is living in Paris and is working as a cartoon artist. She immediately sees through his fa√ßade and realizes that, while keeping up appearances, he is leading an unhappy life. She attempts to explain to Tony why her marriage with Oliver failed: ‚Ä≥Your father was a passionate and disappointed man. When he was young, he had high hopes for himself ...he saw himself as a nobody, a failure and all the passion and disappointment of his life he centered on me. He frightened me and he expected too much from me and he directed every move of my life and a good deal of the time he didn‚Äôt satisfy me... I was timid and uncertain and vengeful and I had a low opinion of myself, so I went out looking for a good opinion of myself in the arms of other men. At first I told myself I was looking for love, but it wasn't so. I didn't find love and I didn't find a good opinion. And it wasn't as though I didn't try.‚Ä≥ Together Lucy and Tony visit the French village where Oliver was killed in combat during the war. This eventually leads to a partial reconciliation of mother and son. Critical Reception A number of critics felt that the novel was not up to the standard of Shaw's past work. Among their objections were that the plot was less than credible, the characters underdeveloped and the subject matter mundane compared with the social issues Shaw had treated in his earlier writing. Also coloring the critics' assessment was the growing perception that Shaw had chosen to sacrifice literary acclaim for commercial success, and had retreated from the idealistic left-wing sentiments expressed in his earliest work. Fueling this concern, prior to publication Shaw was able to sell the film rights to the novel for $400,000, a payment perceived as very high at that time. The Saturday Review noted that the novel tackles moral dilemmas such as whether an intelligent woman should allow herself to be stifled by her husband; whether adultery is a form of rebellion; and whether a child should be forced to bear the full price of a parent's infidelity. Kirkus Reviews found the novel bleak but praised Shaw for his storytelling talent.

While often found within temples, pavilions are not exclusively religious structures. Many Chinese parks and gardens feature pavilions to provide shade and a place to rest.  History  A golden-tiled roof pavilion atop the main hall of the Putuo Zongcheng Temple near Chengde, built from 1767-1771 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Pavilions are known to have been built as early as the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE), although no examples of that period remain today. The first use of the Chinese character for pavilion dates to the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 BCE) and the Warring States period (403-221 BCE). During the Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) they were used as watchtowers and local government buildings. These multi-story constructions had at least one floor without surrounding walls to allow observation of the surroundings. During the Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties wealthy officials and scholars incorporated pavilions into their personal gardens. During this period the function of pavilions shifted from the practical to the aesthetic. Pavilions provided a place to sit and enjoy the scenery, and they also became a part of the scenery itself, being attractive structures. Brush-and-ink landscape scrolls of the Song dynasty (960-1279) show the isolated pavilions of scholar hermits in mountainous regions. Under the impetus of scholarly tastes for the simplicity of a rustic life, while previously pavilions were constructed from stone, other materials such as bamboo, grass and wood came into use.  Types of Chinese Pavilion  CUHK, Hong Kong Pavilions are often classified according to their shape when viewed from above. Round, square, hexagonal and octagonal pavilions are common, while more unusual designs also exist such as the Nanhai Pavilion located at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, which consists of two round pavilions joined together.  Origin of the name  While the name is commonly believed to be related to its purpose as a place to stay and rest (Chinese ÂÅúÁïô‰ºëÊÅØ, pinyin t√≠ngl√≠uxƒ´uxi), the fact that the earliest pavilions were used for military and governmental purposes casts doubt on this interpretation.

His father, a second lieutenant in the Army Air Forces, died during World War II. His mother remarried and moved to Oakland, where Kincaid graduated from Oakland High School. While attending UCLA, Kincaid was spotted in a local stage production by a casting agent and signed to a contract with Universal Pictures. That led to a brief, uncredited performance in Spartacus. Kincaid then landed a regular role in the final season of the television sitcom Bachelor Father (1962), as Warren Dawson, Bentley Gregg's junior partner and fiance of Gregg's niece, Kelly. Kincaid subsequently appeared with Corcoran in the 1965 comedy The Girls on the Beach and had roles in Beach Ball and Ski Party and made what was billed as a \\"guest appearance\\" in Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine. He was strongly considered for the lead of The Graduate before director Mike Nichols chose Dustin Hoffman; Kincaid's agent turned down a cameo to play Katharine Ross' groom in the film His other film roles include the Disney musical The Happiest Millionaire, The Proud and the Damned and a cameo in the slasher film Silent Night, Deadly Night. He also made guest appearances on TV series such as The Beverly Hillbillies, Family Affair, and Get Smart before moving to San Francisco in the early 1970s and launching a successful career as a model. Still later, as an artist, Kincaid used the name N.N. Williams II. He sold his landscapes and seascapes through galleries in Laguna Beach.

Such functions are used to replace inequality constraints by a penalizing term in the objective function that is easier to handle. The two most common types of barrier functions are inverse barrier functions and logarithmic barrier functions. Resumption of interest in logarithmic barrier functions was motivated by their connection with primal-dual interior point methods. Motivation Consider the following constrained optimization problem: :minimize :subject to where is some constant. If one wishes to remove the inequality constraint, the problem can be re-formulated as :minimize , :where if , and zero otherwise. This problem is equivalent to the first. It gets rid of the inequality, but introduces the issue that the penalty function , and therefore the objective function , is discontinuous, preventing the use of calculus to solve it. A barrier function, now, is a continuous approximation to that tends to infinity as approaches from above. Using such a function, a new optimization problem is formulated, viz. :minimize where is a free parameter. This problem is not equivalent to the original, but as approaches zero, it becomes an ever-better approximation. Logarithmic barrier function For logarithmic barrier functions, g(x,b) is defined as -\\\\log(b-x) when x < b and \\\\infty otherwise (in 1 dimension. See below for a definition in higher dimensions). This essentially relies on the fact that \\\\log(t) tends to negative infinity as t tends to 0. This introduces a gradient to the function being optimized which favors less extreme values of x (in this case values lower than b), while having relatively low impact on the function away from these extremes. Logarithmic barrier functions may be favored over less computationally expensive inverse barrier functions depending on the function being optimized. =Higher dimensions= Extending to higher dimensions is simple, provided each dimension is independent.

It is the story of an intelligent but confused young London bookbinder, Hyacinth Robinson, who becomes involved in radical politics and a terrorist assassination plot. The book is unusual in the Jamesian canon for dealing with such a violent political subject. But it is often paired with another novel published by James in the same year, The Bostonians, which is also concerned with political issues, though in a much less tragic manner.  Plot summary  Amanda Pynsent, an impoverished seamstress, has adopted Hyacinth Robinson, the illegitimate son of her old friend Florentine Vivier, a French woman of less than sterling repute, and an English lord. Florentine had stabbed her lover to death several years ago, and Pinnie (as Miss Pynsent is nicknamed) takes Hyacinth to see her as she lies dying at Millbank prison. Hyacinth eventually learns that the dying woman is his mother and that she murdered his father. Many years pass. Hyacinth, now a young man and a skilled bookbinder, meets revolutionary Paul Muniment and gets involved in radical politics. Hyacinth also has a coarse but lively girlfriend, Millicent Henning, and one night they go to the theatre. There Hyacinth meets the radiantly beautiful Princess Casamassima (Christina Light, from James' earlier novel, Roderick Hudson). The Princess has become a revolutionary herself and now lives apart from her dull husband. Meanwhile, Hyacinth has committed himself to carrying out a terrorist assassination, though the exact time and place have not yet been specified to him. Hyacinth visits the Princess at her country home and tells her about his parents. When he returns to London, Hyacinth finds Pinnie dying. He comforts her in her final days, then travels to France and Italy on his small inheritance. This trip completes Hyacinth's conversion to a love for the sinful but beautiful world, and away from violent revolution. Still, he does not attempt to escape his vow to carry out the assassination. But when the order comes, he turns the gun on himself instead of its intended victim. Major themes  At first glance, this novel seems very different from James' usual work because of its concentration on radical politics and less-than- wealthy characters. And it's true that the book comes closer to classic Naturalism than any other long fiction in the Jamesian canon. The influence of French Naturalists like √âmile Zola is evident in the prison scenes, the depiction of the revolutionary movement, and the deterministic nature of Hyacinth's heredity. But the novel also explores themes familiar from James' other work. Hyacinth always seems to be an outsider, unable to participate fully in the life around him. He commits himself to the revolution, then hesitates and wavers. He is attracted to the beauty of the world, but can't enjoy it completely because he sees how it is purchased at the cost of so much human suffering. When the final call comes, he can see no way out of his dilemma: either the state will kill him if he carries out the assassination, or the revolutionaries will kill him if he doesn't. Such hesitations and divided loyalties are common among James' perceptive central characters. Hyacinth's case is particularly acute because his actual life is at stake. In his preface to the New York Edition of the novel, James audaciously compared Hyacinth to Hamlet and Lear. While some may cavil at such comparisons, others believe that Hyacinth's fate does rise almost to classic tragedy. The novel shows a broad panorama of European life at all levels, and the many supporting characters are presented with a generous helping of humor in a story which shows the influence of Dickens from James' early reading.  Critical evaluation  The Princess Casamassima has had a checkered critical history. Early critics, such as Rebecca West, admired the novel's workmanship and characters, but not the melodramatic plot, while later critics, such as Lionel Trilling, found it a convincing account of political reality. Despite the many well-realised supporting characters, the novel stands on its portrayal of anti-hero Hyacinth Robinson. In his New York Edition preface, James said that he believed he had successfully presented a flawed, but affecting, hero; some critics have disagreed, one dismissing Hyacinth as \\"a bit of a wimp\\". The Guardians review, published in 1887, noted that The Princess Casamassima kept to the promise of Roderick Hudson, which James's other novels had not met. The review praised James's characterisation of Hyacinth's friends and comrades, but nonetheless found that James \\"does not understand\\" the English, with the result that his characters are \\"rather extremely clever attempts and conjectures than real life studies.\\" The review concluded: \\"there is a great deal of interest in the book, interest which is not lessened by the fact that its catastrophe is quite unexpected, or rather is one which most readers are likely not to expect, exactly because it is so obvious.\\" In popular culture Princess Casamassima appears prominently, as a vampire and revolutionary, in Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series, notably Anno Dracula 1895, where she is one of the Council of Seven Days, an anarchist organization taken from G.K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday, and in Anno Dracula 1899: One Thousand Monsters, where she is one of several vampires seeking sanctuary in Japan. The book also features in Thomas Pynchon's Against the Day, being read by a literate dog.

Its glyphs are descended from the Indian Brahmi numerals. The full system emerged by the 8th to 9th centuries, and is first described outside India in Al-Khwarizmi's On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (ca. 825), and second Al-Kindi's four-volume work On the Use of the Indian Numerals (ca. 830). Today the name Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals is usually used. Decimal system Historians trace modern numerals in most languages to the Brahmi numerals, which were in use around the middle of the 3rd century BC. The place value system, however, developed later. The Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions in caves and on coins in regions near Pune, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in India. These numerals (with slight variations) were in use up to the 4th century. During the Gupta period (early 4th century to the late 6th century), the Gupta numerals developed from the Brahmi numerals and were spread over large areas by the Gupta empire as they conquered territory. Beginning around 7th century, the Gupta numerals developed into the Nagari numerals. Development in India During the Vedic period (1500‚Äì500 BCE), motivated by geometric construction of the fire altars and astronomy, the use of a numerical system and of basic mathematical operations developed in northern India. Hindu cosmology required the mastery of very large numbers such as the kalpa (the lifetime of the universe) said to be 4,320,000,000 years and the \\"orbit of the heaven\\" said to be 18,712,069,200,000,000 yojanas. Numbers were expressed using a \\"named place- value notation\\", using names for the powers of 10, like dasa, shatha, sahasra, ayuta, niyuta, prayuta, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parardha etc., the last of these being the name for a trillion (1012). For example, the number 26,432 was expressed as \\"2 ayuta, 6 sahasra, 4 shatha, 3 dasa, 2.\\" In the Buddhist text Lalitavistara, the Buddha is said to have narrated a scheme of numbers up to 1053. The first Brahmi numerals, ancestors of Hindu-Arabic numerals, used by Ashoka in his Edicts of Ashoka circa 250 BCE. The form of numerals in Ashoka's inscriptions in the Brahmi script (middle of the third century BCE) involved separate signs for the numbers 1 to 9, 10 to 90, 100 and 1000. A multiple of 100 or 1000 was represented by a modification (or \\"enciphering\\") of the sign for the number using the sign for the multiplier number. Such enciphered numerals directly represented the named place-value numerals used verbally. They continued to be used in inscriptions until the end of the 9th century. In his seminal text of 499 CE, Aryabhata devised a novel positional number system, using Sanskrit consonants for small numbers and vowels for powers of 10. Using the system, numbers up to a billion could be expressed using short phrases, e. g., khyu-gh·πõ representing the number 4,320,000. The system did not catch on because it produced quite unpronounceable phrases, but it might have driven home the principle of positional number system (called dasa-gunottara, exponents of 10) to later mathematicians. A more elegant katapayadi scheme was devised in later centuries representing a place-value system including zero. =Place-value numerals without zero= Bakhshali manuscript, detail of the dot \\"zero\\". While the numerals in texts and inscriptions used a named place-value notation, a more efficient notation might have been employed in calculations, possibly from the 1st century CE. Computations were carried out on clay tablets covered with a thin layer of sand, giving rise to the term dhuli-karana (\\"sand-work\\") for higher computation. Karl Menninger believes that, in such computations, they must have dispensed with the enciphered numerals and written down just sequences of digits to represent the numbers. A zero would have been represented as a \\"missing place,\\" such as a dot. The single manuscript with worked examples available to us, the Bakhshali manuscript (of unclear date), uses a place value system with a dot to denote the zero. The dot was called the shunya-sthƒÅna, \\"empty-place.\\" The same symbol was also used in algebraic expressions for the unknown (as in the canonical x in modern algebra). Textual references to a place-value system are seen from the 5th century CE onward. The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu in the 5th century says \\"when [the same] clay counting-piece is in the place of units, it is denoted as one, when in hundreds, one hundred.\\" A commentary on Patanjali's Yoga Sutras from the 5th century reads, \\"Just as a line in the hundreds place [means] a hundred, in the tens place ten, and one in the ones place, so one and the same woman is called mother, daughter and sister.\\" A system called bh≈´ta-sankhya (\\"object numbers\\" or \\"concrete numbers\\") was employed for representing numerals in Sanskrit verses, by using a concept representing a digit to stand for the digit itself. The Jain text entitled the Lokavibhaga, dated 458 CE, mentions the objectified numeral meaning, \\"five voids, then two and seven, the sky, one and three and the form\\", i.e., the number 13107200000.It has been claimed that a mid-third century CE text Yavana-jataka (on \\"Greek horoscopy\\") employed the device of bh≈´ta-sankhyas (). But it is now considered an error of interpretation. () Such objectified numbers were used extensively from the 6th century onward, especially after Varahamihira ( 575 CE). Zero is explicitly represented in such numbers as \\"the void\\" (sunya) or the \\"heaven-space\\" (ambara akasha).; ; Correspondingly, the dot used in place of zero in written numerals was referred to as a sunya-bindu. = Place-value numerals with zero = The numeral \\"zero\\" as it appears in two numbers (50 and 270) in an inscription in Gwalior. Dated to the 9th century.For a modern image: In 628 CE, astronomer- mathematician Brahmagupta wrote his text Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta which contained the first mathematical treatment of zero. He defined zero as the result of subtracting a number from itself, postulated negative numbers and discussed their properties under arithmetical operations. His word for zero was shunya (void), the same term previously used for the empty spot in 9-digit place-value system. This provided a new perspective on the shunya-bindu as a numeral and paved the way for the eventual evolution of a zero digit. The dot continued to be used for at least 100 years afterwards, and transmitted to Southeast Asia and Arabia. Kashmir's Sharada script has retained the dot for zero until this day. By the end of the 7th century, decimal numbers begin to appear in inscriptions in Southeast Asia as well as in India. Some scholars hold that they appeared even earlier. A 6th century copper-plate grant at Mankani bearing the numeral 346 (corresponding to 594 CE) is often cited. But its reliability is subject to dispute. The first indisputable occurrence of 0 in an inscription occurs at Gwalior in 876 CE, containing a numeral \\"270\\" in a notation surprisingly similar to ours.; ; Throughout the 8th and 9th centuries, both the old Brahmi numerals and the new decimal numerals were used, sometimes appearing in the same inscriptions. In some documents, a transition is seen to occur around 866 CE. Adoption by the Arabs Before the rise of the Caliphate, the Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system was already moving West and was mentioned in Syria in 662 AD by the Nestorian scholar Severus Sebokht who wrote the following: :\\"I will omit all discussion of the science of the Indians, ..., of their subtle discoveries in astronomy, discoveries that are more ingenious than those of the Greeks and the Babylonians, and of their valuable methods of calculation which surpass description. I wish only to say that this computation is done by means of nine signs. If those who believe, because they speak Greek, that they have arrived at the limits of science, would read the Indian texts, they would be convinced, even if a little late in the day, that there are others who know something of value.\\" According to Al-Qifti's History of Learned Men : :\\"... a person from India presented himself before the Caliph al-Mansur in the year [776 AD] who was well versed in the siddhanta method of calculation related to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and having ways of calculating equations based on the half-chord [essentially the sine] calculated in half-degrees ... This is all contained in a work ... from which he claimed to have taken the half-chord calculated for one minute. Al-Mansur ordered this book to be translated into Arabic, and a work to be written, based on the translation, to give the Arabs a solid base for calculating the movements of the planets ...\\" The work was most likely to have been Brahmagupta's Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta (Ifrah) (The Opening of the Universe) which was written in 628 . Irrespective of whether Ifrah is right, since all Indian texts after Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya used the Indian number system, certainly from this time the Arabs had a translation of a text written in the Indian number system. In his text The Arithmetic of Al- Uql√Ædis√Æ (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1978), A.S. Saidan's studies were unable to answer in full how the numerals reached the Arab world: :\\"It seems plausible that it drifted gradually, probably before the 7th century, through two channels, one starting from Sind, undergoing Persian filtration and spreading in what is now known as the Middle East, and the other starting from the coasts of the Indian Ocean and extending to the southern coasts of the Mediterranean.\\" Al-Uqlidisi developed a notation to represent decimal fractions.Al-Uqlidisi biography by J. J. O'Connor and E. F. RobertsonEarliest Uses of Symbols for Fractions by Jeff Miller The numerals came to fame due to their use in the pivotal work of the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, whose book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals was written about 825, and the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi, who wrote four volumes (see [2]) \\"On the Use of the Indian Numerals\\" (Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi) about 830. They, amongst other works, contributed to the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle-East and the West.

Even in many countries in languages which have their own numeral systems, the European Arabic numerals are widely used in commerce and mathematics.

It is approximately long (N/S axis) by wide, and is located from Sakhalin's port of Nevelsk and about directly southwest of Sakhalin Island itself at the northeastern end of the Sea of Japan. It is the only landmass in the whole Tatar Straits. It has no permanent population. History The island was known as Todomoshiri (\\"island of sea lions\\") by its original Ainu inhabitants. It came under the daimy≈ç of Matsumae clan in the 18th century and got its current European name from a visit of the French navigator La Perouse, who named it Moneron after Paul M√©rault Monneron, the chief engineer of his expedition. Paul Moneron was tasked with mapping the island named after him. The first authentic map of Moneron Island was made later, in 1867, by Russian hydrographers who put it on the map of the Russian Empire. The expedition was led by one K. Staritsky, after whom the highest spot was named. Moneron Island was not Russian for long. Latterly, the Japanese named it Kaibat≈ç (Êµ∑È¶¨Â≥∂), which was a Sinicized rendition of its Ainu name, but it reverted to its European name after Japan's defeat in World War II and its occupation by the Soviet Union. Moneron Island is very close to Japan: On a clear day, you can see the Japanese Rishiri Island. =KAL 007= Korean Air Flight 007, with 269 passengers and crew, spiraled around Moneron Island twice during the final phase of its controlled 12-minute descent after being struck by a single air-to-air missile launched at it on September 1, 1983 from a Sukhoi Su-15, for straying into restricted Soviet airspace. Its precise position and final distance from the island are disputed. Fauna and flora The island is a popular place for diving and for birds. Surrounded by steep cliffs and rocky islets, it is a haven for sea birds. The warm Tsushima Current brings abundant marine life to the surrounding waters and species normally found much further south abound. In 2006, infrastructure was constructed to allow tourists to visit the island. The facilities are operated by the Moneron National Park, which is the first marine national park in Russia.

Biography He succeeded to the Earldom of Strathearn in 1329, on the death of his father Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn. After the death of Magnus, Earl of Orkney, he inherited the Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney (including Caithness) in right of his great-great- grandfather Earl Gilbert. Despite the similarity of title, and related etymology, a Norwegian jarl is not the same as a Scottish earlMerriam-Webster Dictionary, entry for Jarl; the position of jarl of Orkney was the most senior rank in mediaeval Norway except for the king himself. In 1330, King Edward III of England wrote to King David II of Scotland and his councillors, including Malise, requesting that certain forfeited noblemen have their lands restored. This request was evaded, if not outright refused, and consequently Edward allowed Edward Balliol to march into Scotland with the dispossessed knights. Malise took an active part in opposing the invaders, commanding the third division of the Scots army at the Battle of Halidon Hill, and was referred to as a \\"notorious rebel\\" by Edward III. He had his earldom forfeited by Balliol, who bestowed it on John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Malise made strenuous efforts to recover Strathearn, but without success, and he went to dwell on his estates in Caithness. By 1340 the influence of Balliol and Edward III had waned, but Malise still did not get back his earldom. During King David's absence in France, he was arraigned before the High Steward and accused of felony and treason, in that he had supposedly resigned the earldom of his own free will by reason of a contract between him and the Earl of Surrey. The jury acquitted him, but the earldom remained in David's hands, who in 1344 bestowed it on Malise's nephew Maurice de Moravia. In 1344 he was summoned before King and Parliament on the same charge. He did not attend in person, but was represented by his brother-in-law William III, Earl of Ross, along with the Bishop of Ross and a lawyer named William Meldrum. He pleaded that he had already been found innocent; this was partly acknowledged by Parliament, though they judged that the earldom should continue to be held by the King. After this, Earl Malise passes from history; his date of death is not known. Marriage and children He is said to have been married twice, his first wife being a daughter of the Earl of Menteith, though no evidence has been found of her existence. His second wife was Marjory, daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross, whom he probably married between 1325 and 1328. By her he had four daughters: *Matilda, married Wayland de l'Ard. Her son Alexander de l'Ard, was made Captain of Orkney in 1375, by the Norwegian king. This was a probationary position, and if passed, Alexander would have been made Jarl the following year; however, he was uninterested in the role, and was soon sacked. Alexander sold his lands in Caithness to Robert II of Scotland; he is sometimes referred to as Earl of Caithness as a result. *Isabella/Isabel, married Sir William Sinclair, 8th of Roslin.

The film is set in a fictitious past, in which space travel is pioneered by roughnecks. The film was released on DVD in Spring of 2005. The band Billy Nayer Show, helmed by McAbee, wrote and performed the film's soundtrack.  Plot  Space travel has become a dirty way of life dominated by derelicts, grease monkeys, thieves, and hard-boiled interplanetary traders such as Samuel Curtis (Cory McAbee), an astronaut from Earth who deals in rare goods, living or otherwise. His mission begins with the unlikely delivery of a cat to a small outer-belt asteroid saloon where he meets his former dance partner, and renowned interplanetary fruit thief, the Blueberry Pirate (Joshua Taylor). As payment for his delivery of the cat, Curtis receives a homemade cloning device already in the process of creating a creature most rare in this space quadrant ‚Äì a Real Live Girl. At the suggestion of the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis takes the Real Live Girl to Jupiter where women have long been a mystery. There, he proposes a trade with the owner of Jupiter: the Real Live Girl clone for the Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast (Gregory Russell Cook). The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast is regarded as royalty on the all-male mining planet of Jupiter because of his unique and exotic contact with a woman. It is Curtis‚Äô intention to take The Boy to Venus and trade him for the remains of Johnny R., a man who spent his lifetime serving as a human stud for the Southern belles of Venus, a planet populated only by women. Upon returning Johnny R's body to his bereaved family on earth, Curtis will receive a handsome reward. While hashing out the plan with the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis is spotted by his nemesis, Professor Hess (Rocco Sisto). Possessed by an enigmatic obsession with Curtis, Hess is capable of killing only without reason; that is, there can be no conflict nor unresolved issues with his intended victim. Hess has been pursuing Samuel Curtis throughout the solar system in order that he might forgive him, then kill him. Along the way, Hess has executed each and every individual to come into contact with Curtis. Unaware of this danger, Curtis sets forth on his mission. After retrieving The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast from Jupiter, Curtis is contacted by Professor Hess, who makes his intentions known. Fearful, Curtis and The Boy look for a place to hide. They come across a primitive space station constructed by Nevada State silver miners from the late 1800s. Inside they discover a small group of miners still alive, their bodies crippled and deformed by space atrophy. Unable to return home for fear that Earth's gravity would kill them, two of the miners mated and give birth to a boy known as Body Suit (James Ransone). He has been raised in a suit of hydraulics to simulate Earth's gravity with his parent's intention of him eventually being sent home. In trade for supplies and sanctuary, Curtis agrees to deliver Body Suit to Earth. Once they land on the lush planet of Venus, the terrain dramatically changes, and Curtis is inspired by a plan.\\"The American Astronaut Press Kit\\", \\"Artistic License Films.com\\", 2008.

Production  The entire film was shot on 35mm black & white negative film for an ambiguous budget of \\"between 1 and 2 million\\". The unusual use of paintings for special effects shots was mostly for budget reasons. However, the director felt that neither CGI nor miniatures looked convincing. Therefore, they decided to hand paint the special effects shots to create a look unique to the film. Many props and sets were donated or bought with thrift store materials and modified to fit the film's needs. The offline edit was done on an Avid system and the camera negatives were cut to match the video edit and followed a traditional optical post-production. The entire film has overtones of isolation and segregation especially between men and women and has a stark sense of avant-comedy in the vein of Guy Maddin or William Klein films. The American Astronaut was workshopped in 1998 at the Sundance Writers‚Äô Lab while still in screenplay form. Cory McAbee, the film's writer, director, and star, who is also the front man for the rock and roll band, The Billy Nayer Show, began writing the script and composing songs for the film about a decade before. Although The Billy Nayer Show is a band, it was never intended to be devoted solely to the production of music. The group describes itself more like a \\"creative think tank that launches multiple projects in a diverse array of media.\\" The band's multi-facted approach to The American Astronaut resulted in a film that featured numerous hand made elements as well as an emphasis on craft. For The American Astronaut, McAbee, Production Designer Goeff Tuttle, and artist Maria Schoenherr hand-painted every shot depicting the exterior of Curtis‚Äô spaceship as it travels through outer space. As producer Josh Taylor explains, \\"We wanted to represent outer space in a way that no one had ever seen before\\". The look of outer space depicted in The American Astronaut was inspired by McAbee's memories of his grandfather and father. An inventor, whiskey runner and freight train jumper, and a guy who could fix absolutely anything mechanical, McAbee's grandfather was in many ways a holdover from the days when Northern California was still the Wild West. McAbee's father, in turn, was an auto mechanic and cowboy from Booneville, California. Many of \\"Astronaut‚Äôs\\" costumes were designed, discovered and often hand made by Dawn Weisberg. Curtis‚Äô outfit, The Boy's outfit, and Body Suit's body suit all reflect the personal histories of the characters and are meant to evoke the lonely routine of outer space. But Weisberg also created whole communities based on wardrobe, from the first men we see in the saloon to the legion of laborers on Jupiter to the all-female society on Venus. \\"Dawn really understood Cory‚Äôs notion of groups of isolated men and women and how fashion would get translated under those circumstances,\\" says producer Taylor. W. Mott Hupfel III photographed The American Astronaut. He worked closely with McAbee to achieve a black and white that could help audiences suspend disbelief about an outer space where there is no atmosphere to filter light, while still leaving a lot up to the imagination. \\"We wanted the audience to see much of what is happening in shadow,\\" explains McAbee. The Boy's performance on stage was lit and photographed to create a massive shadow, which in some shots takes up much of the screen. Mott also lit and photographed The Boy like a silent movie star in the scenes that he and Curtis share in the space ship. Says McAbee,\\" Mott worked on putting a little bit more light on Greg than on me. It was like a special effect that explained everything about our characters ‚Äì here was this dirty trader guy at the helm and next to him was this young hero. Mott understood what we were after and made the film look exactly right.\\" All of the music that appears in The American Astronaut was written and composed for the film by The Billy Nayer Show's McAbee, Bobby Lurie (on drums and one of the film's producers), James Beaudreau (guitar) and Michael Silverman (bass). But as with all of The Billy Nayer Show's musical enterprises, McAbee worked to create a unique sound for the musical elements of The American Astronaut ‚Äì elements to not only advance the film's narrative, but to fit the characters‚Äô motivations and moods. Says McAbee, \\"One of the things about the film that makes it unlike other musicals is that the music is organic ‚Äì the people in the film aren‚Äôt just putting it out there for no reason. I wanted musical numbers to be fully integrated into the story. So one number happens at a dance contest, one at a rally of workers on Jupiter, and one number is even used as a kind of musical assault perpetrated against Curtis in a bathroom. Curtis uses song to make a grand entrance when he is in the open air of Venus, but even then he is serenading the ladies there to persuade them to do business. He is trying to charm them and soften them up.\\" \\"When we went to create the soundtrack,\\" explained McAbee, \\"it was a more physical process than when we would record a new album. When I went in to talk with everyone about how I wanted a song to go, we would have to describe how the camera was moving, what the characters were doing, take into account choreography. Because of this, the ideas we had for the music going into the studio continued to develop, and the songs turned out greater than we ever anticipated.\\" Much of the film ‚Äì from the interiors of Curtis‚Äô spaceship to the grand auditorium where the workers on all-male Jupiter rally ‚Äì was shot in an old ballroom in Maspeth, Queens. While providing a great \\"Art Deco gone wrong\\" space for such operatic moments as the song by the Boy Who Actually Saw a Woman's Breast, the Maspeth location was a challenging place to shoot. Freezing cold, filthy with (noisy) nesting pigeons and located adjacent to a (noisier) major truck route, the production nonetheless had the run of their own soundstage for as long as they needed it, as well as an atmosphere that was as still and as cold and as dead as the face of the moon. In the end, Music Director Bobby Lurie learned from making The American Astronaut that \\"People think that they can fix a film with music, as if music were a band-aid or something. It never works. But I also learned that you can take a good film and make it great with the right music. Our hope is that because we were able to listen to a lot of people‚Äôs ideas, and they were able to listen to ours, we‚Äôve been able to come up with something really unique, really different, and really fun.\\"\\"The American Astronaut Press Kit\\", \\"Artistic License Films.com\\", 2008.

Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court case, in which the death penalty sentencing of Warren McCleskey for armed robbery and murder was upheld. The Court said the \\"racially disproportionate impact\\" in the Georgia death penalty indicated by a comprehensive scientific study was not enough to mitigate a death penalty determination without showing a \\"racially discriminatory purpose.\\". McCleskey has been described as the ‚Äúmost far-reaching post-Gregg challenge to capital sentencing.‚Äù McCleskey was named one of the worst Supreme Court decisions since World War II by a Los Angeles Times survey among legal scholars. In a New York Times comment eight days after the decision, Anthony Lewis charged that the Supreme Court had \\"effectively condoned the expression of racism in a profound aspect of our law.\\" Anthony G. Amsterdam called it ‚Äúthe Dred Scott decision of our time.‚Äù Justice Lewis Powell, when asked by his biographer if he wanted to change his vote in any case, replied, \\"Yes, McCleskey v. Kemp.\\" Justice John Paul Stevens was still angry over the decision after his own retirement in 2010. Background Warren McCleskey was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of murder in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. McCleskey was African American; his victim was white Atlanta Police Officer Frank Schlatt. At the sentencing hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a police officer engaged in the performance of his duties. A finding of either aggravating circumstance was sufficient to impose the death penalty. Petitioner did not provide any mitigating circumstances, and the jury recommended the death penalty. The court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death. On appeal to the federal courts via a habeas petition, petitioner alleged the state's capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner based his claims on a study, conducted by jurists David C. Baldus, Charles Pulaski, and statistician George Woodworth (the ‚ÄúBaldus study‚Äù), that indicated a risk that racial consideration entered into capital sentencing determinations. Baldus, a law professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, studied 2500 murder cases in Georgia. Baldus' study concluded that all individuals convicted of murdering whites were far more likely to receive the death penalty, thus establishing that the application of the death penalty in Georgia was linked with the race of the victim. One of his models concluded that even after taking account of 39 nonracial variables, defendants charged with killing white victims were 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence than defendants charged with killing blacks. Opinion of the Court The Court, in an opinion by Justice Lewis Powell, held that the statistical study did not present substantial evidence that would require a reversal of petitioner's conviction. The Court concluded that the lower court had properly applied Georgia law. The decision said that even if Baldus' statistical data were accepted at face value, the defense failed to show evidence of conscious, deliberate bias by law officials associated with the case, and it dismissed evidence of general disparities in sentencing, such as the Baldus study, as \\"an inevitable part of our criminal justice system.\\" A major point in dispute in reaching the majority's decision was the proposition that the 2,500 cases studied, like other cases in general, did not share common personnel or officials but each case involved a different set of jurors, frequently different judges, and different prosecutors. Thus no common mechanism was either identified or likely to explain a racially disparate impact. Without a plausible basis for inferring that a racially disparate effect was circumstantial evidence of a racially biased cause (even if a hidden cause), the Supreme Court majority did not find racial bias or discrimination. The majority sought to distinguish between a disparate effect as evidence of a discriminatory system from a disparate effect without a discriminatory cause. Thus, the Supreme Court left open the possibility that if a racially biased influence were identified the result might be different. Without more, the majority viewed each of the 2,500 cases in the study as a separate event without any discernible linkage between them. Dissenting opinions Three dissenting opinions were filed by Justices Brennan, Blackmun, and Stevens. The dissenters largely agreed with and crossjoined one another's dissents, and Justice Marshall joined two of the dissents. Brennan's lengthy dissent noted at the outset the belief he shared with Justice Marshall that \\"the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\\" Brennan further contended that even if capital punishment were constitutional, it could hardly be so where it was demonstrably biased against members of a particular race. Blackmun's dissent largely echoed Brennan's concerns regarding the evidence of racial bias in capital cases. Stevens did not go so far as to suggest that the death penalty was inherently inappropriate under these circumstances but stated that the case should have been remanded to the Court of Appeals for a determination of the validity of the Baldus study. Impact McCleskey v. Kemp has bearing on claims broader than those involving the death penalty. McCleskey has been used to illustrate that claims based on government denial of \\"equal protection of the laws\\" to racial minorities may fail unless something more than discriminatory effect can be shown. The Supreme Court generally requires, in addition to discriminatory effect, for a discriminatory purpose to be shown as the government's motivation for creating the law in the first place (See: Washington v. Davis., and Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney,. for further clarification of this concept). Thus, although a discriminatory effect may be an ingredient of a successful Equal Protection claim, it is probably insufficient on its own (see Palmer v. Thomas). Overall, McCleskey may be seen to clarify the Supreme Court's desire to punish discriminatory acts by government rather than merely discriminatory effects. At the same time federal and state governments choosing to use executions continue to carry out their deadly work with full and undeniable knowledge that the practice is tainted by racial bias, similar the pre-Furman practices made unconstitutional in 1972.see Keys and Maratea (2016). Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, has criticized the decision: > McClesky versus Kemp has immunized the criminal justice system from judicial > scrutiny for racial bias. It has made it virtually impossible to challenge > any aspect, criminal justice process, for racial bias in the absence of > proof of intentional discrimination, conscious, deliberate bias ... Evidence > of conscious intentional bias is almost impossible to come by in the absence > of some kind of admission. But the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the > courthouse doors are closed to claims of racial bias in the absence of that > kind of evidence, which has really immunized the entire criminal justice > system from judicial and to a large extent public scrutiny of the severe > racial disparities and forms of racial discrimination that go on every day > unchecked by our courts and our legal process.

While Espuelas was CEO, Starmedia was the leading Latin portal, serving over 25 million Spanish and Portuguese speakers every month across the Latin world. In total, StarMedia raised over $500 million in a series of private and public offerings, reaching a market capitalization of over $3.8 billion at its peak.

After a frustrating year and a half of approaching venture capitalists to invest in his vision, only to have them uniformly refuse, many avowing that Latins \\"did not like technology\\" and would never use the Internet, the company went on to raise $2.5 million in 1997. It was the first venture capital ever invested in a Latin Internet company. Over the next 4 years, the company raised over $500 million in investments, including capital from Chase Manhattan Bank, GE Capital, eBay, the Hearst Corporation, Intel Capital, NBC and David Rockefeller. According to the New York City Investment Fund, \\"[Espuelas]...spoke about the impact, similar to that of economic integration on European nations, that his business would have unifying Latin American people separated by national borders. A board member interrupted him. It was David Rockefeller, retired head of Chase Manhattan, brother of Nelson, and a longtime pillar-the pillar-of corporate involvement in New York City life. Rockefeller wanted to hear more. He invited Espuelas to his office.\\" \\"It was the most exciting thing in my life,\\" says the entrepreneur. He recalls how the meeting went: \\"I didn't close the sale with him until I showed him a map of Latin America without any borders. He said, 'Oh, that's good.'\\" Rockefeller and the Fund became investors in StarMedia, which moved its headquarters from Connecticut to the city and quickly grew to more than 700 employees worldwide. Espuelas tells this story at a reception that New York's corporate elite was throwing for Rockefeller's 86th birthday. He introduces Rockefeller as his \\"shareholder, partner, and inspiration.\\" The New York City Investment Fund: An Emerging Model For Corporate Engagement in Urban Development \\"They have managed to come up with a pretty big capital raising at the intersection of two of the most volatile investment themes in America: the Internet and Latin America,\\" said Lanny Baker, an analyst of on-line media industry for Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco.\\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/1998/10/13/BUSINESS12045.dtlt San Francisco Chronicle, Viva Internet: StarMedia Inc. lands $80 million to fund Latin American Web community In 1999, the company went public on the Nasdaq, the first Latin Internet company to do so, eventually reaching a market valuation of over $3.8 billion USD at its peak. Starmedia had over 1,200 employees in 18 offices across 12 countries in the Americas and Europe. Today, Starmedia is France Telecom's single largest Internet operation in the world, according to company statements. StarMedia, acquired by France Telecom in 2002, is a free-to-web global service connecting Spanish-speakers through the Internet as well as providing consumers relevant and extensive information and services. StarMedia has local operations in Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Spain and throughout the United States (Los Angeles, Miami and New York) Founding, Capitalization and Growth Fernando Espuelas and his childhood friend, Jack Chen, founded StarMedia in 1996 with $100,000 in personal savings, credit cards and loans from friends and family. A year later, after being turned down by over 50 venture capitalists across the U.S., the pair were successful in raising $3.5 million from Susan Segal, general partner of Chase Capital Partners and its technology affiliate Flatiron Partners. Soon after, StarMedia raised additional venture capital from WarburgPincus, the New York City Investment Fund and David Rockefeller. In 1998, StarMedia made history when it raised an additional $80 million in the largest private placement for an Internet company up to that time. David Rockefeller, wealthy Latin American families, Intel, the Hearst Corporation, Intel, NBC and GE Capital were the principal investors in that round. StarMedia went on to raise over $500 million in a combination of public and private offerings. Well before the twin stock market and Latin American collapses of 2000-2001, which severely impacted StarMedia's business and share price, major StarMedia investors had realized significant profits on their StarMedia investments. Investors such as WarburgPincus, Intel, GE Capital, Hearst and many other institutions and individuals sold their StarMedia shares at or near the peak of the market. Espuelas writes in his book Life in Action: ‚ÄúBecause I believed in our company and our mission, I had never sold a single StarMedia share or stock option. I personally lost close to $500 million.‚ÄùLife in Action According to the Harvard Business School case StarMedia: Launching a Latin American Revolution , written by professors Thomas Eisenmann and John K. Rust, \\"by the fall of 1999, StarMedia had sprinted to a sizable lead in the race to acquire Latin American Internet users. Its pan-regional, horizontal portal was the first to target Spanish- and Portuguese-language speakers on the Internet, registering 1.2 billion page views in the third quarter of 1999. Thirty-three-year-old StarMedia co-founder Fernando Espuelas was the toast of \\"Silicon Alley\\" and a recognized hero throughout Latin America. A picture of him on the cover of Internet World magazine--ripping his shirt open to show the StarMedia logo, like Superman, summed up the spirit of the company.\\"Harvard Business School case StarMedia: Launching a Latin American Revolution http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=800166 StarMedia implemented Espuelas' relentless innovation strategy. StarMedia launched web-based email, chat and streaming video in Spanish and Portuguese before its U.S.-focused competitors such as Yahoo, Excite, Lycos or AOL did in English. StarMedia's webmail service, branded as LatinMail was a popular free email service, launched in 1997, 7 years before the creation of Gmail in 2004 as an early beta webmail service. LatinMail services were discontinued suddenly in 2017 LatinMail discontinued its services with no prior notice from Starmedia. StarMedia's chat was first introduced in 1999 and branded as LatinChat.The history of Starmedia's LatinChat StarMedia's chat service was very popular for some years and visited from all over Latin America since its launch until StarMedia discontinued the service in late 2017, disabling the website. LatinMail and LatinChat websites and brands were registered as independent trademarks, operated as a service by StarMedia. In 1996, Espuelas launched the first ever television campaign across Latin America promoting the Internet and the StarMedia brand, helping to spark the subsequent explosion of Internet use in the region. Along with CBS News, it launched the Web's first video news channel in 1997. Other innovations included the first instant messaging system in Latin America; in partnership with HP the first out-of- the-box e-commerce platform for small businesses; and with IBM, the first free ISP in the region. As part of Espuelas' push, StarMedia acquired 12 other media and technology companies in the U.S., Latin America and Spain. At its peak, StarMedia had over 1,200 employees in 18 offices across 12 countries. First Public Offering of a Latin Internet Company StarMedia went public on Nasdaq under stock symbol STRM, on May 25, 1999 in an IPO of 7 million shares priced at $15 per share, reaching a market capitalization of $1.2+ billion on its first day of trading. It was the first Latin Internet company to go public, creating what Brazil's leading business magazine Exame called the \\"Espuelas Effect\\", eventually reaching a market capitalization of more than $3.8 billion. According to the New York Times in an article from May 31, 1999, Espuelas, who had immigrated with his mother from Uruguay with $100, was worth over $160 millionNew York Times, Stocks Drive a Rush to Riches In Manhattan's Silicon Alley, https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DE1230F932A05756C0A96F958260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=all at the end of the first day of trading; at its peak, Espuelas' holdings in StarMedia were valued at over $500 million. He never sold any shares or stock options, as Espuelas wrote in Life in Action. StarMedia became the best known, most highly traded Latin Internet Stock on Nasdaq during the late 1990s dot- com boom. Other stocks in the sector included Terra Networks and AOL Latin America. Technology market blow-up, Latin American regional bust and sale During the .com bust of the early 2000s, which coincided with the worst Latin American economic collapse in a generation, StarMedia lost almost all of its market value, and was the subject of class-action shareholder litigation. After an independent investigation initiated by a special committee of Board of Directors found no wrongdoing by management, the Board's Audit Committee and StarMedia's outside accountants, the class-action suit was settled by the Board and its insurance company. As part of the settlement, a full release was given by the shareholders to the former management, the company's outside accountants, Ernst & Young, and the Board's Audit Committee. The lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the Federal judge.( Class Action notice of settlement in re Starmedia Network, Inc. securities litigation, July 29, 2002) In August 2001, Espuelas resigned as CEO after conflicts over strategy with the Board of Directors. Enrique Narciso was named CEO of the company. The Board, led by Chase Capital Partners' Susan Segal, decided to abandon Starmedia's core business to focus on the mobile solutions subsidiary, StarMedia Mobile. The StarMedia network of websites, related intellectual property and over 25 million unique users per month audience were sold to the Spanish ISP eresMas Interactive for US$8 million in cash on July 3, 2002. The following week eresMas, now claiming to be the leader of the Spanish-language Internet industry because of its acquisition of StarMedia, was acquired by France Telecom subsidiary Wanadoo SA (now called Orange after a rebranding in 2006) for more than $255 million euros.http://elpais.com/diario/2002/07/19/economia/1027029607_850215.html According to Orange, StarMedia is the leading Spanish-language portal in the world.

This was an important milestone in understanding DNA and RNA. Early life Pirie was born in Easebourne, near Midhurst in West Sussex, the youngest of three children of Sir George Pirie, a Scottish painter, and his wife while they were on a visit to England. He was raised near Torrance, East Dunbartonshire. He developed a stammer, and was educated by private tutors and then spent periods at Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow, Harriston School near Dumfries, and Hastings Grammar School, and then from 1921 to 1925 at Rydal School in Colwyn Bay. He studied natural sciences (biochemistry) at Emmanuel College, Cambridge from 1925 to 1929, and became a demonstrator after graduating. He married fellow biochemist Antoinette (Tony) Patey in 1931.

From 1932, he worked with Ashley Miles on the Brucella bacteria responsible for brucellosis, and with Frederick Bawden on potato viruses. They studied the tobacco mosaic virus, demonstrating that the virus contained ribonucleic acid (when others claimed they were just proteins). Bawden moved to Rothamsted Experimental Station in Harpenden in 1936, and Pirie also moved to Rothamsted as a virus physiologist in 1940, becoming head of the biochemistry department in 1947. During the Second World War, Pirie investigated the possibility of extracting edible proteins from leaves. Experiments on extracting edible leaf proteins continued into the 1970s. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1949, delivered its Leeuwenhoek Lecture in 1963 and won its Copley Medal in 1971 for his virology work. He retired in 1972, but continued work on beta carotene in leaf proteins. Like his wife, he was an atheist, and was concerned about nuclear weapons. He served as chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) scientific committee for several years. His wife died in 1991. He died in Harpenden, survived by his two children.

This bittersweet tragicomedy centres on an odd triangle of characters: Basil Ransom, a political conservative from Mississippi; Olive Chancellor, Ransom's cousin and a Boston feminist; and Verena Tarrant, a pretty, young prot√©g√©e of Olive's in the feminist movement. The storyline concerns the struggle between Ransom and Olive for Verena's allegiance and affection, though the novel also includes a wide panorama of political activists, newspaper people, and quirky eccentrics. Plot summary Mississippi lawyer and Civil War veteran, Basil Ransom, visits his cousin Olive Chancellor in Boston. She takes him to a political meeting where Verena Tarrant delivers a feminist speech. Ransom, a strong conservative, is annoyed by the speech but fascinated with the speaker. Olive, who has never before set eyes on Verena, is equally fascinated. She persuades Verena to leave her parents' house, move in with her and study in preparation for a career in the feminist movement. Meanwhile, Ransom returns to his law practice in New York, which is not doing well. He visits Boston again and walks with Verena through the Harvard College grounds, including the impressive Civil War Memorial Hall. Verena finds herself attracted to the charismatic Ransom. Basil eventually proposes to Verena, much to Olive's dismay. Olive has arranged for Verena to speak at the Boston Music Hall. Ransom shows up at the hall just before Verena is scheduled to begin her speech. He persuades Verena to elope with him, to the discomfiture of Olive and her fellow-feminists. The final sentence of the novel shows Verena in tears ‚Äì not to be her last, James assures us. Themes Unlike much of James' work, The Bostonians deals with explicitly political themes: feminism and the general role of women in society. James was at best ambivalent about the feminist movement, and the early chapters harshly satirise Olive and her fellow ideologues. Another theme in the book, much discussed recently, is Olive's possible lesbian attraction to Verena. (The term Boston marriage, apparently first used here by James, came to connote just such an ambiguous co-habiting long-term relationship between two women.) James is not explicit here, partially due to the conventions of the time. But this vagueness may actually enrich the novel because it creates possible ambiguity about Olive's motives. As Ransom gets closer to winning Verena, he seems to lose at least some of his creator's sympathy. James was rather suspicious of the winners in life who scoop up all the goodies, especially the sexual goodies. He becomes more sympathetic to Olive in the later chapters as she begins to lose Verena. This is especially evident in chapter 39, where Olive experiences a painful recognition of her situation somewhat similar to Isabel Archer's long nighttime meditation in chapter 42 of The Portrait of a Lady. The three central characters are surrounded by a vivid supporting cast of would-be reformers, cynical journalists, and sometimes sinister hangers-on. James shows remarkable ability to create a broad cross-section of American society, which helps refute the charge that he could only handle small, closed-off bits of life. The title refers, not to the people of Boston in general, but to the two characters Olive and Verena, \\"as they appeared to the mind of Ransom, the southerner, and outsider, looking at them from New York.\\"James, Henry.

James' portrayal of Boston reformers was denounced as inaccurate and unfair, especially because some felt James had satirised actual persons in the novel.

In 1919 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. After working at the London Hospital as an assistant bacteriologist, he moved in 1934 to work at the Middlesex Hospital. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1934. In 1940 he helped Donald D. Woods discover how sulphonamides worked. He was a member of the scientific staff, Medical Research Council (1934‚Äì49). =World War II= Fildes asserted that he assisted with Operation Anthropoid the assassination of top Nazi Reinhard Heydrich in Prague by providing the Czech agents of the Special Operations Executive with modified No. 73 Grenades filled with botulin toxin. The story has been met with scepticism, given the absence of any indication that Heydrich displayed any of the highly distinctive symptoms of botulism. In 1940 Fildes was put in charge of a newly created department, the Biology Department, Porton (BDP) at Porton Down to study the defensive implications of a bacterial attack and there built up a team of microbiologists to study the use of biological weapons, including anthrax and botulinum toxin. An early project was the creation of a stockpile of a million anthrax impregnated cattle cakes to be used in a possible retaliatory attack. In 1942 it famously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon developed at Porton Down at Gruinard Island. He also assisted with the anthrax strain tests on Gruinard Island, performing necropsies on the bodies of anthrax-exposed sheep, to determine if they had died as a direct result of anthrax poisoning. This work produced the world's first working anthrax bomb in the summer of 1942.Guillemin, Jeanne (2005), Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-Sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism, ( Internet Archive), Columbia University Press, pp. 50‚Äì56, (). At the end of the war he returned to university life and handed over control of the department to his deputy David Henderson, who would oversee the building of a new purpose designed laboratory facility and the creation of the autonomous Microbiological Research Department. He was knighted in 1946. =Later years= After the war Fildes worked at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford, headed by Nobel Prize winner Sir Howard Florey, to study on the biochemistry of bacteriophage T1 (and to a lesser extent, T2) multiplication.

In the twelfth century BCE, after the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces, Greek settlers from Argos arrived on this site. In the seventeenth century, Kourion suffered from five heavy earthquakes, but the city was partly rebuilt. The acropolis of Kourion, located 1.3 km southwest of Episkopi and 13 km west of Limassol, is located atop a limestone promontory nearly 100 metres high along the coast of Episkopi Bay. The Kourion archaeological area lies within the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and is managed by the Cyprus Department of Antiquity. History of Kourion Edge of Kourion plateau with ancient tombs =Early history of the area= The earliest identified occupation within the Kouris River valley is at the hilltop settlement of Sotira-Teppes, located 9 km northwest of Kourion. This settlement dates to the Ceramic Neolithic period (c. 5500‚Äì4000 BCE). Another hilltop settlement from the same era has been excavated at Kandou-Kouphovounos on the east bank of the Kouris River. In the Chalcolithic period (3800‚Äì2300 BCE) settlement shifted to the site of Erimi- Pamboules near the village of Erimi. Erimi-Pamboules was occupied from the conclusion of the Ceramic Neolithic through the Chalcolithic period (3400‚Äì2800 BCE). Occupation in the Early Cypriot period (circa 2300‚Äì1900 BCE) is uninterrupted from the preceding Chalcolithic period, with occupation continuing along the Kouris River Valley and the drainages to the west. Sotira-Kaminoudhia, located to the northwest of Sotira-Teppes, on the lower slope of the hill, was settled. It dates from the Late Chalcolithic to EC (Early Cypriot) I (ca 2400 ‚Äì 2175 BCE). In the ECIII-LC (Late Cypriot) IA (ca. 2400 ‚Äì 1550 BCE) a settlement was established 0.8 km east of Episkopi at Episkopi-Phaneromeni. The Middle Cypriot (1900‚Äì1600 BCE) is a transitional period in the Kouris River Valley. The settlements established during the MC flourished into urban centres in the Late Cypriot II-III, especially Episkopi- Bamboula. In the Late Cypriot I-III (1600‚Äì1050 BCE) the settlements of the Middle Cypriot period developed into a complex urban centre within the Kouris Valley, which provided a corridor in the trade of Troodos copper, controlled through Alassa and Episkopi-Bamboula. In the MCIII-LC IA a settlement was occupied at Episkopi-Phaneromeni. Episkopi-Bamboula, located on a low hill 0.4 km west of the Kouris and east of Episkopi, was an influential urban centre from the LC IA-LCIII. Online edition by the Perseus Project. Online edition by the Perseus Project. The town flourished in the 13th century BCE before being abandoned c.1050 BCE. =Kingdom of Kourion= The Kingdom of Kourion was established during the Cypro-Geometric period (CG) (1050‚Äì750 BCE) though the site of the settlement remains unidentified. Without Cypro-Geometric settlement remains, the primary evidence for this period is from burials at the Kaloriziki necropolis, below the bluffs of Kourion. At Kaloriziki, the earliest tombs date to the 11th century BCE. (Late-Cypriot IIIB) with most burials dating to the Cypriot-Geometric II (mid-11th to mid-10th centuries BCE). These tombs, particularly McFadden's Tomb 40, provide a picture of an increasingly prosperous community in contact with mainland Greece.Kourion: The Evidence for the Kingdom from the 11th to the 6th Century BCE, Diana Buitron- Oliver, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research No. 308, The City-Kingdoms of Early Iron Age Cyprus in Their Eastern Mediterranean Context (Nov., 1997), pp. 27‚Äì36 Although Cyprus came under Assyrian rule, in the Cypro-Archaic period (750‚Äì475 BCE) the Kingdom of Kourion was among the most influential of Cyprus. Damasos is recorded (as Damasu of Kuri) as king of Kourion on the prismhttps://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=291290&partId;=1 (672 BCE) of Esarhaddon from Nineveh. Between 569 and ca. 546 BCE Cyprus was under Egyptian administration. In 546 BCE Cyrus I of Persia extended Persian authority over the Kingdoms of Cyprus, including the Kingdom of Kourion. During the Ionian Revolt (499‚Äì493 BCE), Stasanor, king of Kourion, aligned himself with Onesilos, king of Salamis, the leader of a Cypriot alliance against the Persians. In 497 Stasanor betrayed Onesilos in battle against the Persian general Artybius, resulting in a Persian victory over the Cypriot poleis and the consolidation of Persian control of Cyprus. In the Classical Period (475‚Äì333 BCE) the earliest occupation of the acropolis was established, though the primary site of settlement is unknown. King Pasikrates () of Kourion is recorded as having aided Alexander the Great in the siege of Tyre in 332 BCE. Pasikrates ruled as a vassal of Alexander but was deposed in the struggles for succession amongst the diadochi. In 294 BCE the Ptolemies consolidated control of Cyprus, and Kourion came under Ptolemaic governance. =Roman history= In 58 BCE the Roman Council of the Plebs (Consilium Plebis) passed the Lex Clodia de Cyprus, annexing Cyprus to the province of Cilicia. Between 47 and 31 BC, Cyprus returned briefly to Ptolemaic rule under Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII, reverting to Roman rule after the defeat of Antony. In 22 BC, Cyprus was separated from the province of Cilicia, being established an independent senatorial province under a proconsul. Under the Romans, Kourion possessed a civic government functioning under the oversight of the provincial proconsul. Inscriptions from Kourion attest elected offices that including: Archon of the City, the Council, Clerk of the Council and People, the Clerk of the Market, and various priesthoods including priests and priestesses of Apollo Hylates, and priesthoods of Rome. In the first to third centuries, epigraphic evidence attests a thriving elite at Kourion, as indicated by a floruit of honorific decrees (Mitford No.84, p. 153) and dedications, particularly in honour of the emperor, civic officials and provincial proconsuls. In the first and second centuries, Mitford suggests excessive expenses by the Council of the City and Peoples of Kourion on such honours, resulting in the sanctions and oversight of expenditures by the proconsul (Mitford 107), particularly during the Trajanic restorations of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates. Local participation in the imperial cult is demonstrated not only by the presence of a high priesthood of Rome, but also the presence of a cult of Apollo Caesar, a veiled worship of Trajan as a deity alongside Apollo Hylates. Epigraphic honors of the imperial family are particularly notable during the Severan Dynasty in the late third and second century AD. As one of the most prominent cities in Cyprus, the city is mentioned by several ancient authors including: Ptolemy (v. 14. ¬ß 2), Stephanus of Byzantium, Hierocles and Pliny the Elder. During the Diocletianic Persecution, Philoneides, the Bishop of Kourion, was martyred. In 341 CE, the Bishop Zeno was instrumental in asserting the independence of the Cypriot church at the Council of Ephesus. In the later-4th century (c. 365/70) Kourion was hit by five strong earthquakes within a period of eighty years, as attested by the archaeological remains throughout the site, presumably suffering near complete destruction. In the late fourth and early fifth centuries, Kourion was reconstructed, though portions of the acropolis remained abandoned. The reconstruction included the ecclesiastical precinct on the western side of the acropolis. In 648/9 Arab raids resulted in the destruction of the acropolis, after which the center of occupation was relocated to Episkopi, 2 km to the northeast. Episkopi was named for the seat of the Bishop (Episcopus).Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1057‚Äì1058Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 438 History of excavations The site of Kourion was identified in the 1820s by Carlo Vidua. In 1839 and 1849, respectively, Lorenzo Pease and Ludwig Ross identified the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates to the west of the acropolis. In 1874‚Äì5, Luigi Palma di Cesnola, then American and Russian consul to the Ottoman government of Cyprus, extensively looted the cemetery of Ayios Ermoyenis and the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates. Between 1882 and 1887 several unauthorized private excavations were conducted prior to their illegalization by British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Bulwer in 1887. In 1895 the British Museum conducted the first quasi-systematic excavations at Kourion as part of the Turner Bequest Excavations. P. Dikaios of the Department of Antiquities conducted excavations in the Kaloriziki Cemetery in 1933. Between 1934 and 1954, G. McFadden, B.H. Hill and J. Daniel conducted systematic excavations at Kourion for the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania. Following the death of G. McFadden in 1953, the project and its publication stalled. The excavations of the Early Christian Basilica on the acropolis were continued by A.H.S. Megaw from 1974‚Äì9. The Cyprus Department of Antiquities has conducted numerous excavations at Kourion including: M. Loulloupis (1964‚Äì74), A. Christodoulou (1971‚Äì74), and Demos Christou (1975‚Äì1998). Between 1978 and 1984 D. Soren conducted excavations at the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates, and on the acropolis between 1984 and 1987. D. Parks directed excavations within the Amathus Gate Cemetery between 1995 and 2000. Since 2012, the Kourion Urban Space Project, under director Thomas W. Davis of the Charles D. Tandy Institute of Archaeology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, has excavated on the acropolis. Archaeological remains Kourion's Greco-Roman theatre. The majority of the archaeological remains within the Kourion Archaeological Area date to the Roman and Late Roman/Early Byzantine periods. The acropolis and all archaeological remains within the area are managed and administered by the Cyprus Department of Antiquities. =The Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates= The Temple of Apollo Hylates The Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates (·ºàœÄœåŒªŒªœâŒΩ ·ΩôŒªŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ), located 1.7 km west of the acropolis and 0.65 km in from the coastline, was a Pan-Cyprian sanctuary, third in importance only to the sanctuaries of Zeus Salaminos at Salamis and that of Paphian Aphrodite. The earliest archaeological evidence for the sanctuary are from votive deposits of the late eighth century BC located in the southern court and at the archaic altar. These votive offerings are dedicated to ‚Äúthe god,‚Äù apparently unassociated with Apollo until the mid-third century BC. North of the priests residence and south of temple are the remains of an archaic altar, the earliest structure at the sanctuary dating to the late-eighth or early seventh-century AD. A structure of the late-fourth century BC, located east of the later sacred way, and south of the altar served as the residence of the priests of Apollo and the temple treasury. This building was subsequently renovated in the first, third and fourth centuries AD. The present form of the sanctuary dates to the first century AD and to the restoration under Trajan in the early second century following the earthquake of AD 76/77. Under Augustan patronage at the end of the first century BC or early first century AD the sacred street was laid out, with the palaestra, temple, structure north of the Paphian gate and the circular monument were constructed. The Augustan temple is 13.5 m long and 8.35 m wide with a tetrastyle pronaos and cella. Sanctuary baths Under Trajan and the Proconsul Quintus Laberius Justus Cocceius Lepidus the sanctuary underwent restoration and expansion. The southern portico, southern buildings, which likely functioned as dormitories for devotees and the bathhouse were built under this restoration. The temple was subsequently abandoned after a period of decline in the late fourth century AD, after it was sustained significant damage in an earthquake. =Late Cypro-Classical and Hellenistic remains= Pyramidal structure beneath baths The earliest structural remains yet excavated on the acropolis were uncovered at the northwestern end of the excavations directed by D. Christou in the civic center. These Late Cypro-Classical (350‚Äì325 BCE) remains consist of an ashlar pyramidal structure, perhaps a fortified glacis. Further fortifications dating to the Cypro-Classical have been uncovered along the northern extent of the acropolis area. The remains of a Hellenistic public structure, approximately 30 m in length are located 30 m southeast of the nymphaeum. This structure was used from ca. 325 to 50 BCE. Additional Hellenistic remains were uncovered in 1948/49 by the University of Pennsylvania Museum Expedition immediately east of the Complex of Eustolios in the form of black and white pebble mosaic. =Theatre= The theatre of Kourion was excavated by the University Museum Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania between 1935 and 1950. The theatre was initially constructed on a smaller scale in the late-second century BCE on the northern slope of the defile ascending from the Amathus Gate. This arrangement thus utilized the slope of the hill to partially support the weight of the seating in the cavea. This architectural arrangement is typical of Hellenistic theatres throughout the Eastern Mediterranean with a circular orchestra and a cavea exceeding 180 degrees. The theatre was repaired in the late-first century BCE, likely following the earthquake of 15 BCE. The theatre's scene building was seemingly reconstructed in 64/65 CE by Quintus Iulius Cordus, the proconsul, and it was likely at this time the ends of the cavea were removed, reducing it to a Roman plan of 180 degrees. The orchestra was likewise shortened to a semi-circular form. The theatre received an extensive renovation and enlargement under Trajan between ca. 98‚Äì111 CE, bringing the theatre to its present size and seating arrangement. The scene building (scenae frons), now preserved only in its foundations, was rebuilt, bringing it to the height of the cavea. This structure would have originally obscured the view of the Mediterranean to the south. Between 214 and 217 CE, the theatre was modified to accommodate gladiatorial games and venationes but it was restored to its original form as a theatre after 250 CE. The theatre was abandoned in the later-fourth century CE, likely the result of successive seismic events, the earthquake of 365/70 perhaps resulting in its abandonment. The enlarged cavea of the Roman phases could have accommodated an audience of as many as 3,500. The present remains of the theatre have been restored extensively. The theatre is one of the venues for the International Festival of Ancient Greek Drama.Cyprus Centre of International Theatre Institute site =Amathus Gate Cemetery= Located along the base of the cliffs on the southeast and northeast of the acropolis, the Amathus gate cemetery is located north of the road entering the archaeological site, and as such it is the first series of monuments seen by visitors prior to their entrance into the site. In Antiquity the ascent to the Amathus gate was along a board ramp ascending gradually from the southeast. The cemetery was situated on two tiers along the lower and upper cliffs east of the Amathus gate, the lower tier being obscured by the modern roadway embankment. From the third century BC until the first century AD the cemetery of Ayios Ermoyenis, consisting primarily of rock-cut chamber tombs with single or multiple chambers and multiple interments, functioned as the primary cemetery of Roman Kourion. Between the first and third centuries, a row of chamber tombs was cut into the upper and lower faces of the eastern cliffs. These chamber tombs were heavily damaged by quarrying in the late fourth to sixth centuries AD, though numerous arcosolia from these chamber tombs remain in the cliff face. Between the late fourth and sixth centuries burials in this cemetery consist of cist burials cut into the quarried rock shelf. =Aqueducts= Though the acropolis is very arid today, the city clearly had a good water supply in Roman times as evidenced at least by the Nymphaeum and large public and private baths, and also by the substantial amount of piping and water features throughout the site. Joseph S. Last identified two aqueducts that transported water to the city from two perennial springs: one near Sotira (the smaller source) 11 km distant and Souni (the larger source) at 20 km distant. The western aqueduct from Sotira was made of an estimated 30,000 terra-cotta pipes 0.20 m in diameter and 0.20‚Äì0.50 m long. A trunk line of this aqueducts supplied water to the Sanctuary of Apollo. The eastern aqueduct from Souni consisted of an estimated 60,000 pipes with a 0.30 m diameter and 0.30 m length. Last concluded that the eastern aqueduct was a later addition to supplement the western aqueduct.J.S. Last: The Ancient Water Supply, in: Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society vol 199-1 (1975) pag 39 ‚Äì 72http://www.romanaqueducts.info/aquasite/kourion/ Prior to the construction of these aqueducts, sometime in the first century CE, the acropolis would have been largely dependent on rain water stored in cisterns due to the absence of natural water sources on the site. =House of the Gladiators= Mosaic of two gladiators, Margarites (left) and Hellenikos (right), late-3rd century CE, House of the Gladiators mosaic of gladiators being separated by a referee, late-3rd century CE, House of the Gladiators The so-called House of the Gladiators is located south and east of the House of Achilles. The structure dates to the late-3rd century AD and has been interpreted as an elite-private residence, or perhaps more probably as a public palaestra. The later interpretation is supported by the absence of many rooms appropriate for living spaces and that the structure was entered from the east through the attached bath complex. The main wing of the structure is arranged around a central peristyle courtyard. The northern and eastern portico of the atrium contains two panels depicting gladiators in combat, the only such mosaics in Cyprus. The structure was extensively damaged in the earthquakes of the late-4th century, but the east rooms seem to have been used until the mid-7th century. =House of Achilles= The House of Achilles is located at the northwestern extent of the acropolis, at the southern end of a saddle connecting the acropoline promontory to the hills to the north and west. In antiquity, it was located outside the walls near the proposed site of the Paphos Gate. Constructed in the early fourth century CE, it has been interpreted as an apantitirion, or a public reception hall for imperial and provincial dignitaries. Its precise function remains unknown. The structure is arranged around a central peristyle courtyard, its northeastern portico retaining fragmentarily preserved mosaic pavements in the northeastern portico. The most important of these mosaic depicts the unveiling of Achilles‚Äô identity by Odysseus in the court of Lycomedes of Skyros when his mother, Thetis, had hidden him there amongst the women so that he might not be sent to war against the Trojans. Another room contains a fragmentary mosaic depicting Thetis bathing Achilles for the first time. In yet another room a fragmentary mosaic depicts the Rape of Ganymede. The structure was destroyed in the earthquakes of the late fourth century AD, likely the 365/370 earthquake. =The ‚ÄúEarthquake House‚Äù= Located 155 m southeast of the Early Christian Basilica, and 95 m northeast of the cliffs are the remains of a domestic structure containing dramatic evidence of the CE 365/370 earthquakes that destroyed many of the excavated structures on the acropolis. The earthquake house, in its initial phases was likely constructed in the late first or early second centuries AD. Throughout its use it was subsequently reused and redesigned with interior spaces being subdivided and the structure expanded to fit the changing needs of its inhabitants. Its destruction in the earthquakes of the late fourth century, and the absence of rebuilding in this area of the city subsequently provides a dramatic view on non-elite life at Kourion. Among the evidence of destruction found were the remains of two sets of human skeletal remains postured in an embrace, the remains of a juvenile who had fallen from the upper floor into the stable area when the floor collapsed, the remains of a young adult woman with an infant being held by an adult male approximately twenty-five years old, and three sets of adult male skeletal remains between the ages of 25 and 40. The remains of a mule were found in the stable area, its remains still chained to a limestone trough. The earthquake house, initially uncovered in a sounding by the University of Pennsylvania Museum expedition was excavated by D. Soren between 1984‚Äì87. Archaeological investigations were continued in 2014 with excavations by the Kourion Urban Space Project. =The Forum, the Nymphaeum and the Forum Baths= Nympheum, Kourion The forum of Kourion, as it appears today, was constructed in the late second or early third centuries. The forum, the centre of public life, consisted of a central pavement with colonnaded porticoes set along its east, north and western sides. The eastern portico measured 65 m in length and 4.5 m wide, with a colonnade facing the courtyard, and a wall forming frontage of shops to the west. The northern portico provided access to a monumental nymphaeum and a bath complex thermae constructed around the nymphaeum to the north. The western portico was renovated in the early fifth century to provide an entrance to the episcopal precinct, located immediately to the west. The nymphaeum, was developed in four successive phases from the early first century AD to the mid seventh century, and was among the largest nymphaea in the Roman Mediterranean in the second and third centuries. In its earliest phase the nymphaeum consisted of a rectangular room with a tri-apsidal fountain set in its northern wall flowing into a rectangular basin along the length of the same wall. After an earthquake in CE 77, the nymphaeum was rebuilt between 98 and 117. The nymphaeum was internally dived by a courtyard with a room to the south containing an apsidal fountain and rectangular basins. In this phase, the nymphaeum measured 45 m long and 15 m wide. After its destruction in the earthquakes of the late fourth century, the nymphaeum was rebuilt as a three-aisled basilica with apses along the southern wall. This structure was used as a temporary church between 370 and 410 during the construction of the ecclesiastical precinct to the west. It was abandoned in the mid seventh century. The baths, which surround the nymphaeum at the northwestern end of the forum, were constructed in the early to mid fourth century CE following repairs to the nymphaeum. The baths were divided into east and west wings by the nymphaeum. The eastern baths were arranged around a central corridor which opened onto a sudatorium, a caldarium, and a tepidarium to the north. The western baths possessed a series of axially aligned baths along the northwest wall of the nymphaeum. The Baths =Stadium= The stadium The stadium of Kourion, located 0.5 km west of the acropolis and 1.1 km east of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates, was constructed during the Antonine period (c. 138‚Äì180). The stadia at Kourion was 187 m long with a starting line marked by two circular stone posts, set wide enough to accommodate eight runners. The dromos was enclosed on the north, west and south by a free-standing curved seating structure measuring 217 m long and 17 m wide. This structure consisted of seven rows of seating supported by a 6 m thick ashlar wall. Seating was probably accessed by stairs set at 10 m intervals along the exterior. The dromos was accessed through gaps in the seating in the middle of its north, south and western sides. This structure provided sufficient seating for approximately 6,000 spectators. In its entirety the stadium measured 229 m long and 24 m wide. The stadium was abandoned in later-half of the 4th century. It remains the only excavated stadium in Cyprus. =The Baths and House of Eustolios= Mosaic in the Complex of Eustolios at Kourion The House and Baths of Eustolios, situated on the crest of the southern cliffs immediately above the theatre, was constructed in the late-fourth century over the remains of a structure destroyed in the mid-4th century. In the early years of the fifth century, soon after the completion of the house, a bathing complex was constructed along the house's northern side. The household and bath annex on the northern side contains more than thirty rooms. The complex was entered from the west, the visitor passing into a rectangular forecourt. A salutatory inscription in the vestibule beyond the forecourt reads, \\"Enter for the good luck of the house.\\" Rooms were arranged north and south of this forecourt and the vestibule, including a peristyle courtyard to the south at its eastern extent. The southern peristyle was arranged around a central pool and is the centrepiece of the household, its porticoes adorned with elaborate mosaics. A mosaic inscription in the eastern portico identifies the building as Eustolios, who built the structure to alleviate the suffering of the populace of Kourion, presumably in response to the earthquakes of the mid-to- late 4th century. The inscription identifies Eustolios as a Christian, concluding, ‚Äúthis house is girt by the much venerated signs of Christ.‚Äù The accompanying iconography includes figural depictions of fish and birds (grey goose, guinea hen, falcon, partridge and pheasant). The bathing complex is arranged around a central rectangular hall and included a frigidarium with an antechamber, a tepidarium, and a caldarium. The frigidarium is paved with a figural mosaic depicting a personification of Ktisis (Creation) holding an architect's ruler. The complex remained in use until its destruction in the mid-7th century. The household was probably constructed as an private elite- residence, but was converted into a publicly-accessible bathing facility in the early-fifth century. =Episcopal Precinct and Cathedral of Kourion= The cathedral and episcopal precinct of Kourion, located along the crest of the cliffs immediately southwest of the forum, was constructed at the beginning of the fifth-century and renovated successively in the sixth century. This cathedral, the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Kourion, was a monoapsidal, three-aisled basilica, constructed on an east-west orientation. The aisles were separated from the nave by colonnades of twelve columns set on plinths. The central nave's eastern terminus ended in a semicircular hemidomed apse with a synthronon. The basilica was magnificently appointed according to its importance within the ecclesiastical structure of Cypriot Christianity. Its walls were revetted in white marble. The altar was enclosed within a chancel screen, and covered within a four-posted baldachin. The aisles were paved in opus sectile while the nave was paved with polychrome mosaics. The complex included a narthex, arrayed along the western facade of the basilica, and peristyle atria to the west and north of the narthex. The northern atrium provided access to the episcopal palace to its west, or to the baptistery, diakoinon and catchecumena along the northern side of the basilica. The Diakoinon in the Basilica The precinct was constructed at the end of the fourth and very beginning of the fifth centuries CE, a time in which Kourion was recovering from the devastation of the earthquakes of 365/370. The allocation of such resources to this basilica, as well as the concurrent abandonment of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates, indicates the centrality Christianity had assumed to the city's religious institutions. The precinct was destroyed during the Arab raids of the seventh century, after which the seat of the Bishop of Kourion was moved inland =The Northwestern Basilica= In the late-fifth century, another tri-apsidal, three-aisled basilica was constructed on the height northwest of the acropolis on the northern side of the road between the acropolis and the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates. In Classical antiquity this may have been the site of a sanctuary dedicated to Demeter and Kore, as evidenced by a dedicatory inscription found at the site, though the remains of this sanctuary have not been located. The basilica was constructed on an easterly orientation. The central nave and aisles were paved with marble slabs. The central apse possessed a synthronon for the clergy, with the chancel set apart from the nave by marble screens and an opus sectile pavement. The basilica was accessed through a colonnaded peristyle courtyard and narthex west of the basilica. The atrium was entered from its northern and southern sides. The peristyle courtyard was centred upon a rectangular cistern. Also accessed off the narthex and atrium were two catechumena, flanking the basilica to the north and south, and a diakoinon to the north. The basilica was abandoned in the mid-7th century during the early Arab raids on the southern coast of Cyprus. =The Early Christian Beachfront Basilica= In the early-6th century, an early Christian basilica was constructed at the base of the southwestern bluffs, below the acropolis, near the western extent of the unexcavated harbor area. The church was a tri-apsidal, three-aisled basilica that measured approximately 27.5 m in length and 14 m in width on its exterior. It was oriented with the altar facing southeast. The central nave measured approximately 25 m including the apse, and 5.5 m wide, with the flanking aisles being 2.75 m in width. The colonnades supporting the clerestory ceiling of the nave consisted of six corinthian columns. The eastern ends of the aisles and nave terminated in half-domes adorned with mosaics. The chancel was paved with opus sectile while the nave and aisles were paved in mosaics. A peristyle atrium was arrayed west of the basilica, with a baptistery opening off the northern portico, and access to the basilica complex being controlled through the southern portico. The peristyle courtyard was centered upon a well. A catechumena was arrayed along the southern aisle of the basilica and was accessed from the southeast corner of the atrium. The basilica was abandoned in the mid-seventh century, the time of the earliest Arab raids on Cypriot coastal cities.

She is best known as one of the founders of Mujeres Libres and served in the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA). Early life Raised by her impoverished, widowed father, Luc√≠a attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. At a young age she began writing poetry and associated herself with the emerging Ultraist literary movement. By 1919, she had been published in a variety of journals, including Los Quijotes, Tableros, Plural, Manantial and La Gaceta Literaria. Working under the male pen name Luciano de San Saor, she was able to explore lesbian themes\\"R. Fue una √©poca transgresora, emergi√≥ el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera acad√©mica de n√∫mero], Victorina Dur√°n, Margarita Xirgu, Ana Mar√≠a Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[secci√≥n feminista de CNT]... Incluso exist√≠a un c√≠rculo s√°fico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia.P. ¬øSe declaraban lesbianas?R. Hab√≠a quien no se escond√≠a mucho, como Polo o Dur√°n, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de S√°nchez Saornil, sus textos no eran expl√≠citos para poder publicarlos, as√≠ que hay que reinterpretarlos.\\"\\"Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos\\" by Juan Fernandez at El Pais at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment. Political activism In 1931, Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil, who had been working as a telephone operator since 1916, participated in a strike by the anarcho-syndicalist labor union, Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), against Telef√≥nica. The event was a turning point in her life, serving as an entry into political activism. From this point forward, Luc√≠a dedicated herself to the struggle for anarchist social revolution. In 1933, Luc√≠a was appointed Writing Secretary for the CNT of Madrid, producing their journal in the run up to the Spanish Civil War. In May 1938, she became the General Secretary of the Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA), an anarchist aid organization similar to the Red Cross. Writing in anarchist publications such as Earth and Freedom, the White Magazine and Workers' Solidarity, Luc√≠a outlined her perspective as a feminist. Although quiet on the subject of birth control, she attacked the essentialism of gender roles in Spanish society. In this way, Luc√≠a established herself as one of the most radical of voices among anarchist women, rejecting the ideal of female domesticity which remained largely unquestioned. In a series of articles for Workers' Solidarity, she boldly refuted Gregorio Mara√±√≥n's identification of motherhood as the nucleus of female identity. =Mujeres Libres= Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil and Emma Goldman Dissatisfied with the chauvinistic prejudices of fellow republicans, Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil joined with two compa√±eras, Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n, to form Mujeres Libres in 1936. Mujeres Libres was an autonomous anarchist organization for women committed to a \\"double struggle\\" of women's liberation and social revolution. Luc√≠a and other \\"Free Women\\" rejected the dominant view that gender equality would emerge naturally from a classless society. As the Spanish Civil War exploded, Mujeres Libres quickly grew to 30,000 members, organizing women's social spaces, schools, newspapers and daycare programs. In 1937, while working in Valencia as the editor of the journal Threshold, Luc√≠a met Am√©rica Barroso, who would become her lifelong partner. Exile and hiding With the defeat of the Second Republic, Luc√≠a and Am√©rica were forced to flee to Paris, where Luc√≠a continued her involvement in the SIA. With the fall of France to German forces, it was soon necessary for them to move again and they returned to Madrid in 1941 or 1942. In Madrid, Luc√≠a worked as a photo editor but quickly had to relocate again after being recognized as an anarchist partisan. She and Am√©rica moved to Valencia where Am√©rica had family. Due to the rise of fascism and Catholic moralism, their lesbian relationship now put them at significant personal danger and was maintained in secrecy. During this time, Am√©rica worked in the Argentine consulate while Luc√≠a continued her work as an editor until her death from cancer in 1970. During this time, her poetry demonstrates her mixed outlook, embracing both the pain of defeat and the affirmation of struggle. She left behind no memoir. Luc√≠a's tombstone epitaph in the General Cemetery of Valencia reads, \\"But is it true that hope has died?\\" (\\"¬øPero es verdad que la esperanza ha muerto?\\").

Career In 1926, Kluyver and Hendrick Jean Louis Donker published the now classic paper, \\"Die Einheit in der Biochemie\\" (\\"Unity in Biochemistry\\"). The paper helped establish Kluyver's vision that, at a biochemical level, all organisms are unified. Kluyver famously expressed the idea with the aphorism: \\"From elephant to butyric acid bacterium ‚Äì it is all the same\\". The paper, and other work from Kluyver's lab, helped support both the concept of biochemical unity as well as the idea of \\"comparative biochemistry\\", which Kluyver envisioned as biochemically equivalent to comparative anatomy. The concept established a theoretical basis for studying chemical processes in bacteria and extrapolating those processes to higher organisms. The concepts of \\"biochemical unity\\" and \\"comparative biochemistry\\" were both very influential and probably Kluyver's most significant work. Kluyver's best known student, C. B. van Niel, commented on his mentor's scientific influence and noted that by the middle of the 20th century his work on biochemical unity was no longer cited. His aphorism was sufficiently widespread that in 1961 Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod paraphrased it, without mentioning Kluyver, as \\"that old axiom 'what is true for bacteria is also true for elephants'\\" to justify the genetic code's universality. His career was profoundly influenced by World War II and the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Awards and honours Kluyver is associated with the Delft school of microbiology where he was the successor to Martinus Beijerinck. In 1926 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is considered the father of comparative microbiology, and in 1953 won the Copley medal.

Early years Williams was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, and grew up in nearby Handsboro, Mississippi. He also spent time in Newton, Mississippi. A self-taught musician, he was attracted to the bass lines in songs and so sought to master that instrument. Beginning at age 14 he played with Deep South, a gospel music group that his father sang with. Around 1965 he met drummer Jai Johanny Johanson, later to be known as Jaimoe, in high school and began played in bands with him. They played in a number of bands along with Gulf Coast, the most known of which was George Woods' Sounds of Soul, for whom Williams played from 1965 to 1967. Williams was influenced by players from James Jamerson in R&B; to Stanley Clarke in jazz, and in turn Williams' R&B; playing helped Jaimoe gain a better understanding of how to play the bass drum and where to place the beat. Military service In 1968, Williams was drafted into the United States Army. Initially he was assigned to a Special Services band, which performed for Army basic training recruits, for non-commissioned officers' clubs, and for local townspeople. They played music in many different genres, including country and western and ragtime. Williams later reflected that it had been an interesting time musically and that, \\"I think it's important to have perspectives on different types of music and not let yourself get into a rut by playing only one style. I like to keep track of all of it.\\" Williams was then shipped overseas to South Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. He was opposed to the war in particular and was a pacifist who was opposed to killing in general. According to Willie Perkins, the Allmans' road manager, \\"one day when his unit took a column left, Lamar took a column right into the countryside.\\"No Saints, No Saviors: My Years with the Allman Brothers Band, By Willie Perkins - Page 82 According to author Scott Freeman, who wrote a history of the Allman Brothers Band, Williams related that he went AWOL as soon as he arrived at an airbase in South Vietnam, running between two barracks and into the jungle. He wandered around the countryside for several months, occasionally joining a new unit and giving a story that he had become separated from his previous unit. Williams' story continued that he was arrested at one point but got free, and then after that several black members of the Military Police let him know whenever the MPs were getting close to finding him again. Williams was given an honorable discharge in 1970, with the rank of private. He went through a period of formal \\"processing out\\" of the Army and then adjusted to civilian life, including letting his hair grow longer. Musical career =The Allman Brothers= Williams (top center) with the Allman Brothers c. 1975‚Äì76 After jamming with a Biloxi group known as the Fungus Blues Band, Williams joined the Allman Brothers Band in late 1972 after the death of original bassist Berry Oakley. His tenure in the group coincided with the peak of their commercial success. When Williams auditioned, or 'tried out,' for the bass player gig with the Allmans, second drummer Butch Trucks suddenly declared after three songs, \\"Enough of this tryout shit, let's rehearse.\\" Although rooted in the contrapuntal fluidity of Jamerson's style, Williams' style was more traditional than Oakley's lead guitar-like approach, freeing the band's drummers to be more adventurous.Bman's Blues Library - A tribute to Lamar WilliamsOne Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band, By Alan Paul - pages 199‚Äì200No Saints, No Saviors: My Years with the Allman Brothers Band, By Willie Perkins - Page 82 21 A New Beginning The Allmans found the peak of their commercial success during this time period. Williams, like other new member Chuck Leavell, was a salaried employee of the corporation formed by the surviving four members of the group.Perkins, No Saints, No Saviors, p. 83. During the group disintegration period of the mid-1970s, Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe felt a tight bond with each other, but Allman, Betts, and Trucks went their own ways.Perkins, No Saints, No Saviors, p. 86. When the Allman Brothers Band reformed in the late 1970s, consideration was given to Leavell and Williams returning, but the two wanted to keep Sea Level going rather than give a full-time commitment to the Allmans and so they declined.Perkins, No Saints, No Saviors, p. 130. =Sea Level= After the Allmans dissolved in 1976, Williams founded Sea Level with Johanson and pianist Chuck Leavell of the Allmans.The Artificial Southerner: Equivocations and Love Songs, By Philip Martin - Page 77 In Sea Level he played in a looser, jazzier fashion.

One child, Lamar Williams, Jr., is also a musician and currently plays with the Athens, Georgia-based band The Revival. From 2015 to 2017, he also performed with several Allman Brothers alumni, including Johanson, Trucks, percussionist Marc Qui√±ones and bassist Oteil Burbridge, as a vocalist in Les Brers. The short-lived band (envisioned as a continuation of the Allman Brothers Band's stylistic approach) fulfilled its final engagement in August 2017 following Trucks' death in January of that year. One of Williams' brothers, James Williams, is also a bassist. He is a founding member of the Lansing, Michigan-based blues band Root Doctor.All About Jazz, October 15, 2008 - Greg Nagy: Our Time Has Come - By David KingInsurgentcountry.net - Root Doctor featuring Freddie Cunningham, 'New Attitude' by Johanna B. Bodde Illness and death Williams was found to have lung cancer in 1981. His doctors believed that the disease was derived from exposure to Agent Orange during his Vietnam service. He had extensive surgery and underwent chemotherapy. He spent much of his final year at Veterans Affairs medical facilities in the Los Angeles area. He died less than two years later, seven days after his 34th birthday, on January 21, 1983 in Los Angeles. Funeral services were held back in Gulfport. He is buried in Biloxi National Cemetery in Biloxi, Mississippi. The non-profit Lamar Williams Foundation For Agent Orange Research was established after his death, with monies from some benefit concerts in 1985 and 1986 going to it and other Vietnam War related organizations. The foundation was subsequently merged into the larger Welcome Home, Inc. organization, which was concerned with a variety of challenges facing Vietnam veterans. In 2015, the Mississippi Blues Trail placed a historical marker titled \\"Gulfport Boogie\\" to honor Jaimoe, Williams, and others from the immediate area who had left their mark on the American musical landscape.

A property in Medford Township was purchased in 1957 as the site for Lenape High School, which opened in the 1958-59 school year with 548 students in 9th and 10th grades only. By the 1961-62 school year, Lenape was on double sessions with approximately 1,500 students. In July 1961, an addition to the original building was started, with a second addition dedicated on January 17, 1965. A 1967 referendum led to development of Shawnee High School, which opened in the southeastern end of Medford Township for the 1971-72 school year, while Cherokee High School opened in Evesham Township for the 1975-76 school year.

A member of the Allman Brothers Band throughout their commercial zenith in the 1970s, he subsequently became a founding member of the jazz rock ensemble Sea Level. He has served as the principal touring keyboardist and de facto musical director of The Rolling Stones since 1982. As a session musician, Leavell has performed on every Rolling Stones studio album released since 1983 with the exception of Bridges to Babylon (1997). He has also toured and recorded with Eric Clapton, George Harrison, David Gilmour, Gov't Mule and John Mayer. Biography Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Leavell is a mostly self-taught musician. He started on piano, learning some basics from his mother, Frances Leavell. The Leavell family moved from Birmingham to Montgomery, Alabama when he was five, then back to Birmingham for a few years, finally settling in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1962. He learned to play guitar from his cousin, Winston Leavell, and played tuba in junior high for two years. He started his first band, The Misfitz, in 1966. The Misfitz played a steady gig at the YMCA every Friday night, and eventually were the band for a Saturday morning television show, Tuscaloosa Bandstand. After the breakup of the Misfitz, Leavell did session work, and found himself on his first gold record, a single by Freddie North called \\"Don't Take Her She's All I've Got\\". Leavell also sought out other local musicians to play with and joined The South Camp in 1968. That band included his early mentor, Paul Hornsby, who had played in The Hour Glass, a precursor to The Allman Brothers Band. In 1969, Hornsby moved to Macon, Georgia to work for Capricorn Records as a studio musician and producer, eventually producing such artists as The Charlie Daniels Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie and others. At Hornsby's suggestion, Leavell came to Macon and helped form Sundown, which recorded one record on the Ampex label in 1970. That band broke up shortly thereafter, and Leavell found himself doing session work at Capricorn and eventually was tapped to tour with Alex Taylor, James Taylor's elder brother. Leavell recorded one record with Taylor, Dinnertime, which was released in 1972. Leavell continued to tour with Taylor for a short time afterwards. When Taylor had a falling out with his manager and the founder of Capricorn, Phil Walden, and quit touring, Leavell found himself playing with Dr. John. Leavell claims this was his \\"college education.\\" While playing with Dr. John, Leavell caught the attention of Gregg Allman, who tapped him to play on his first solo album, the Johnny Sandlin- produced Laid Back. Allman and Sandlin introduced the rest of the Allman Brothers Band to Leavell, and Leavell joined the band in September 1972, when they decided not to recreate their dual lead guitar sound after the death of Duane Allman, who had died the previous October, but rather to use a different instrument as the second lead. Leavell's work was most prominent on the band's popular 1973 album Brothers and Sisters, and in particular on the heavily played instrumental \\"Jessica.\\" However, only one studio album, 1975's Win, Lose or Draw, followed, again with Leavell's piano and keyboard work featured. Leavell with Sea Level In 1973, Leavell married Rose Lane White, who was working as a staff member at Capricorn Records. The Allmans toured heavily behind Brothers and Sisters, playing stadiums and breaking records for attendance in many venues across the country. Leavell also appeared on a live record with the band, Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas during this era as well as subsequent compilations, live performances and re-releases in later years. During the mid-1970s Leavell also appeared on Dickey Betts's first solo record, Highway Call. In addition during this time, he made multiple contributions on several other Capricorn artists' recordings like Bobby Whitlock, Bonnie Bramlett, The Marshall Tucker Band, Cowboy and more as well as recordings outside the Capricorn family with Tim Weisberg, Charlie Daniels and others. The Allmans found themselves in turmoil in 1976, and broke up that year. Later the band re-formed, but without Leavell as he had moved on to form his own band, Sea Level in late 1976. While opening shows for The Allman Brothers Band with The Allman Brothers' bass guitarist Lamar Williams and drummer Jaimoe, Leavell stepped up as a frontman for the first time in his career. After The Allman Brothers Band disbanded in May 1976, the trio added guitarist Jimmy Nalls and set about touring behind the moniker Sea Level, derived from Leavell's first initial and last name. The group lasted five years and released as many albums, each featuring a different configuration of the group. Leavell's first encounters with The Rolling Stones were auditions on Long View Farm for the spot of piano player alongside Ian Stewart for the Rolling Stones 1981 United States tour. Even though Ian McLagan was chosen, Leavell guested at the Rolling Stones' Atlanta gig on October 26, 1981. For the 1982 European Tour Leavell landed the position of keyboardist alongside Ian Stewart. Leavell continued to record with the Stones on their next two albums, during a time when the band was not touring. After Stewart's death in 1985, Leavell occupied the role of the group's keyboardist by himself, with the exception of the addition of Matt Clifford on the Steel Wheels record and tour. He has continued to tour and record with The Rolling Stones ever since, as well as recording with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on solo projects. The Stones' most recent studio recording was in 2012, Doom and Gloom. He continued to go on tour with The Rolling Stones, as of 2006, as part of their record- grossing A Bigger Bang Tour. He served as the unofficial \\"musical director\\" for the band and devised each night's set list with Mick Jagger. \\"It's my job to keep Mick, Keith, Charlie and Ronnie all happy\\", Leavell stated on his web page. He began keeping notes on the songs during rehearsals, which eventually led to his role with the band. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/chuck-leavell-talks-stones-tour/ Relix In addition to his work with The Rolling Stones, Leavell has worked with George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Gov't Mule, Train, Tinsley Ellis, The Black Crowes, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Montgomery Gentry, John Mayer, Miranda Lambert, Blues Traveller amongst many others in the studio and on the road, in addition to recording five solo albums. In 2003, Leavell participated in the annual improvisational musical experiment known as Zambiland Orchestra in Atlanta. Leavell was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2004. He is also a member of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. In an April 2007 radio interview on WOR-AM, Leavell said his favorite contributions to songs in his career were \\"Jessica\\" with The Allman Brothers Band, \\"Old Love\\" on Eric Clapton's Unplugged, Out of Tears on The Rolling Stones' Voodoo Lounge, and Drops of Jupiter by Train. In 2011, Leavell played on John Mayer's album Born and Raised which was released in May 2012, reaching Number One on the Billboard Chart. He also worked with David Gilmour, who reached to him out of the blue years after meeting on a session with Eric Clapton in the early 1990s. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/the_core_the_rolling_stones_chuck_leavell/ Relix In February 2012, he and the other existing members of the Allman Brothers Band received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition to his time in the band from 1972-1976, Leavell performed two shows with the reunited Allman Brothers Band in 1986. Since 2001, he has performed as a guest pianist at more than a dozen Allman Brothers Band concerts, including multiple shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Left to Right: Ray Reach, Chuck Leavell and Peter Wolf at the 2008 BAMA Awards in Birmingham, Alabama Leavell enjoys \\"giving back\\" to the community of his birth. In 1992, he played on a record titled \\"Mr. President\\", which was produced by noted Birmingham jazz keyboardist and vocalist Ray Reach for the purpose of raising money for the homeless in the Birmingham area. Leavell and several other well-known Alabama musicians (including Wayne Perkins, Chuck Tilley, Charlie Hayward, and Kelley O'Neal) donated their time for this project. On March 20, 2008, Leavell was given a BAMA Award (Birmingham Area Music Award) for his contributions to the Birmingham, Alabama musical heritage. The 2008 BAMA Awards ceremony was held at the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame (in the historic Carver Theatre in the Birmingham Civil Rights District). Leavell performed at this ceremony accompanied by the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame All-Stars directed by Ray Reach. Also, at the same ceremony, a BAMA Award was bestowed upon keyboardist/producer Peter Wolf. Leavell makes time to involve himself with other causes, and in 2008 performed with a supergroup which opened for Chuck Berry in Boston. The concert raised money for artists struggling with addiction. Leavell also serves on the Georgia Commission for Hearing Impaired and Deaf Persons. In 2013, Leavell was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Pinetop Perkins Piano Player' category. Leavell is the celebrity spokesperson for Sealevel Systems, Inc. The Allman Betts Band- In November 2018, the sons of Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts announced the formation of The Allman Betts Band. They will kick off 2019 with a new Allman Betts Band album and a worldwide tour that will feature new music, songs from their solo projects and classic Allman Brothers and Gregg Allman tunes in honor of the 50th Anniversary of The Allman Brothers Band. The new album, which is slated to be released in the Spring of 2019, will be produced by Matt Ross-Spang (Jason Isbell, Margo Price, John Prine and Elvis Presley) with Chuck on keyboards. =Tree farmer and conservationist= In addition to his musical career, Leavell is a tree farmer in Twiggs County outside Macon, Georgia, an occupation that began when his wife, Rose Lane Leavell, inherited land in the early 1980s. Together they created Charlane Plantation, now a 2500-acre award- winning Tree Farm and hunting preserve. The Leavells are two-time Georgia Tree Farmers of the Year, and were selected as National Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year in 1999. They are staunch supporters of sustainable forestry, conservation and environmental protection. Chuck wrote his first book, Forever Green: The History and Hope of The American Forest in 2000. His autobiography, Between Rock and a Home Place was published in 2005, and is acclaimed as one of the best rock autobiographies ever published. In 2006, Leavell wrote a children's book, The Tree Farmer. His most recent book is Growing A Better America: Smart, Strong, Sustainable (2011, with J. Marshall Craig), the theme of which is \\"smart\\" growth. It has been called one of the best \\"common sense environmental books of all time\\". Leavell was appointed by former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to the Georgia Land Conservation Council in 2008. He has also served on the Boards of The American Forest Foundation, The United States Endowment for Forestry and Communities and other influential non-profits and makes frequent trips to Washington, D.C. to discuss forestry and environmental policy matters with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In February 2012, the same month he received the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award, he was given an Honorary Forest Ranger award from the United States Forest Service. He has stated that he reveres both of these honors equally. Leavell and Joel Babbit are the co-founders of The Mother Nature Network, an environmental news and information website that launched in January 2009. The site has grown to be the most visited independent environmental website in the world. Leavell serves as Director of Environmental Affairs, and sits on the board of directors for the company. He hosts two video series on mnn.com: \\"Love of the Land,\\" in which he discusses sustainability and conservation issues, and \\"In The Green Room,\\" a series in which he interviews fellow celebrities about the environment and their philanthropic work. Leavell hosts the public television series America's Forests with Chuck Leavell. = Educator = In response to requests from fans and teachers alike, Leavell and Howard Citron co-founded IROCKU, a rock and blues piano instructional website that launched in June 2011. The website includes classic rock and blues piano arrangements, video lessons, and also offers live lessons with stage and session musicians. In August 2017, Leavell and Citron received a United States Patent entitled ‚Äú Apparatus, System and Method for Teaching Music and Other Art Forms‚Äù related to IROCKU's web-based teaching methodology.

Background and education He was born in Moscow in 1887 and his family returned to Warsaw early in his youth. He did not attend school until age ten due to ill health and asthma. Only seven years later, in 1904, he enrolled in the University of Li√®ge. He later studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and became a British citizen. Career Keilin became research assistant to George Nuttall, first Quick Professor of Biology at the University of Cambridge, in 1915, and spent the rest of his career there, succeeding Nuttall as Quick Professor and director of the Molteno Institute in 1931. He retired in 1952. He made extensive contributions to entomology and parasitology during his career. He published thirty-nine papers between 1914 and 1923 on the reproduction of lice, the life-cycle of the horse bot-fly, the respiratory adaptations in fly larvae, and other subjects. He is most known for his research and rediscovery of cytochrome in the 1920s (he invented the name). It had been discovered by C. A. MacMunn in 1884, but that discovery had been forgotten or misunderstood. Awards and honours Keilin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1926. He won its Royal Medal in 1939 and its Copley Medal in 1951.  Legacy  The Keilin Memorial Lecture of the Biochemical Society began in 1964 in his memory, and recipients and the subject of their talk is selected by a committee reflecting Keilin's interests in bioenergetics, electron transfer and mitochondrial biology. A medal with his profile, a financial award and an opportunity for research publication is also awarded. In 2020, the recipient was the University of Cambridge's Prof Judy Hirst.

The film was directed by Louis J. Gasnier and featured a cast of mainly little-known actors. Originally financed by a church group under the title Tell Your Children, the film was intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use. Soon after the film was shot, it was purchased by producer Dwain Esper, who re-cut the film for distribution on the exploitation film circuit, exploiting vulgar interest while escaping censorship under the guise of moral guidance, beginning in 1938‚Äì1939 through the 1940s and 1950s. The film was \\"rediscovered\\" in the early 1970s and gained new life as an unintentional satire among advocates of cannabis policy reform. However, critics have called it one of the worst films ever made. Today, it is in the public domain in the United States. Plot Mae Coleman and Jack Perry are a cohabitating couple who sell marijuana. The unscrupulous Jack sells it to teenagers over Mae's objections; she'd rather stick to an adult clientele. Ralph Wiley, a sociopathic college-dropout-turned-dealer, and siren Blanche help Jack recruit new customers. Ralph and Jack lure high-schooler Bill Harper and college student Jimmy Lane to Mae and Jack's apartment. Jimmy takes Bill to a party where Jack runs out of reefer and Jimmy, who has a car, drives him to pick up more. When they get to Jack's boss' \\"headquarters\\", Jimmy asks for a cigarette as Jack gets out and he gives him a joint. By the time Jack returns, Jimmy is unknowingly high; he drives away recklessly and hits a pedestrian. A few days later, Jack tells Jimmy that the man died of his injuries and agrees to keep Jimmy's name out of the case‚Äîif Jimmy will agree to \\"forget he was ever in Mae's apartment.\\" As the police did not have enough specific details to track Jimmy down, he indeed escapes punishment. Ralph is arrested for Jack's murder. Bill, whose once-pristine record at school has rapidly declined, has a fling with Blanche while high. Mary, Jimmy's sister and Bill's girlfriend, goes to Mae's apartment looking for Jimmy and accepts a joint from Ralph, thinking it's a regular cigarette. When she refuses Ralph's advances, he tries to rape her. Bill comes out of the bedroom and, still high, attacks Ralph. As the two are fighting, Jack knocks Bill unconscious with the butt of his gun, which inadvertently fires, killing Mary. Jack puts the gun in Bill's hand, framing him for Mary's death by claiming he blacked out. The dealers lie low for a while in Blanche's apartment while Bill's trial takes place. Over the objections of a skeptical juror, Bill is found guilty. By now Ralph is paranoid from both marijuana and his guilty conscience. Blanche is also high; at one memorable point she plays the piano more and more rapidly as Ralph eggs her on. The boss tells Jack to shoot Ralph to prevent him from confessing, but when Jack arrives, Ralph immediately recognizes the threat and beats him to death with a stick as Blanche laughs uncontrollably in terror. The police arrest Ralph, Mae, and Blanche. Mae's confession leads to the boss and other gang members also being arrested. Blanche explains that Bill was innocent and agrees to serve as a material witness for the case against Ralph, but instead, she jumps out of a window and falls to her death, traumatized by her own adultery and its role in Mary's death. Bill's conviction is overturned, and Ralph, now nearly catatonic, is sent to an asylum for the criminally insane for the rest of his natural life. The film's story is told in bracketing sequences at a lecture given at a parent-teacher association meeting by high-school principal Dr. Alfred Carroll. At the film's end he tells the parents he has been told that events similar to those he has described are likely to happen again, then points to random parents in the audience and warns that \\"the next tragedy may be that of your daughter... or your son... or yours or yours...\\" before pointing straight at the camera and saying emphatically \\"... or yours!\\" as the words \\"TELL YOUR CHILDREN\\" appear on the screen.

It was originally produced by George Hirliman; however, some time after the film was made, it was purchased by exploitation filmmaker Dwain Esper, who inserted salacious shots. In 1938 or 1939, Esper began distributing it on the exploitation circuit where it was originally released in at least four territories, each with their own title for the film: the first territory to screen it was the South, where it went by Tell Your Children (1938 or 1939). West of Denver, Colorado, the film was generally known as Doped Youth (1940). In New England, it was known as Reefer Madness (1940 or 1947), while in the Pennsylvania/West Virginia territory it was called The Burning Question (1940). The film was then screened all over the country during the 1940s under these various titles and Albert Dezel of Detroit eventually bought all rights in 1951 for use in roadshow screenings throughout the 1950s. Such education-exploitation films were common in the years following adoption of the stricter version of the Production Code in 1934. Other films included Esper's own earlier Marihuana (1936) and Elmer Clifton's Assassin of Youth (1937) and the subject of cannabis was particularly popular in the hysteria surrounding Anslinger's 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. The concept of after-market films in film distribution had not yet been developed, especially for films that existed outside the confines of the studio system, and were therefore considered \\"forbidden fruit.\\" For this reason, neither Esper nor original producer George Hirliman bothered to protect the film's copyright; it thus had an improper copyright notice invalidating the copyright. Over 30 years later, in the spring of 1972, the founder of NORML, Keith Stroup, found a copy of the film in the Library of Congress archives and bought a print for $297. As part of a fundraising campaign, NORML showed Reefer Madness on college campuses up and down California, asking a $1 donation for admission and raising $16,000 toward support for the California Marijuana Initiative, a political group that sought to legalize marijuana in the 1972 fall elections. Robert Shaye of New Line Cinema eventually heard about the underground hit and went to see it at the Bleecker Street Cinema. He noticed the film carried an improper copyright notice and realized it was in the public domain. Seeking material for New Line's college circuit, he was able to obtain an original copy from a collector and began distributing the film nationally, \\"making a small fortune for New Line.\\" Reception Reefer Madness is considered to be a cult classic and one of the most popular examples of a midnight movie. Its fans enjoy the film for the same unintentionally campy production values that made it a hit in the 1970s. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 39% approval rating with an average rating of 4.4/10 based on 26 reviews. However, Metacritic assigned a score of 70 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Los Angeles Times has claimed that Reefer Madness was the first film that a generation embraced as \\"the worst.\\" Leonard Maltin has called it \\"the granddaddy of all 'Worst' movies.\\" Las Vegas CityLife named it the \\"worst ever\\" runner-up to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and AMC described it as \\"one of the worst movies ever made.\\" Adaptations Sean Abley's stage adaptation, Reefer Madness, ran for a year in Chicago in 1992, and had one showing in 1993 as well. American rock band M√∂tley Cr√ºe featured a couple of clips from the film in the video for their song \\"Smoke the Sky\\" from their self-titled 1994 album. The song‚Äôs lyrics deal with marijuana use. The film was spoofed in the 1998 musical Reefer Madness (1998), which was later made into the television film Reefer Madness (2005), which featured actors Alan Cumming, Kristen Bell, Christian Campbell and Ana Gasteyer. A scene from the colorized version of the film. In 2004, 20th Century Fox, in collaboration with Legend Films, released a colorized version on DVD. The original release date was April 20, 2004, a reference to the drug slang term \\"420\\". Also during the film, the number \\"4\\" and then \\"20\\" is flashed very quickly (as a joke on subliminal messages), which is an effect added by Legend Films. It features intentionally unrealistic color schemes that add to the film's campy humor. The smoke from the \\"marihuana\\" was made to appear green, blue, orange and purple, each person's colored smoke representing their mood and the different \\"levels of 'addiction'\\". The DVD also included a short film called Grandpa's Marijuana Handbook; a new trailer for Reefer Madness produced by Legend Films; and two audio commentaries: one discussing the color design and the other being a comedic commentary by Michael J. Nelson, of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame. Legend owns the copyright to the colorized version. While most have praised it for its campy treatment of the cult film, some viewers claimed that the color choices would better suit a film about LSD than a film about cannabis.. In 2013, Nova Scotia based Lions Den Theatre presented a new adaptation of Reefer Madness at Halifax' The Bus Stop Theatre. Keith Morrison adapted the script and directed the production. An updated audio version of the play was uploaded to the company's YouTube channel in May 2020.

Synopsis This synopsis reflects the current version of the show as licensed. For information about other versions of the show and cut songs, see below. =Act I= The year is 1936. As the play opens, the Lecturer, a stern authority figure, informs the audience of the new drug menace, \\"marihuana\\", which threatens the American way of life. (His warnings are reinforced by the Placard Girl, who throughout the play holds up large signs that clearly state scenes' moral lessons.) From his podium, the Lecturer warns the audience that action must be taken immediately, before the Good Ol' U.S.A. succumbs to the Demon Weed (\\"Reefer Madness\\"). The Lecturer illustrates his point by re-enacting \\"the Harper Affair\\", which he claims is a true and horrific scandal. He begins by introducing us to Jimmy Harper and Mary Lane, a lovable pair of wholesome teens who hold hands, sip hot cocoa, and think pure thoughts while studying Shakespeare for English class (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\"). The Lecturer then shows us the seamier side of life at the Reefer Den, populated by drug-addled denizens. We meet Mae, the Reefer Den hostess, who is abused by her slick, pusher boyfriend Jack. She'd leave him, but Jack keeps her supplied with the marijuana she craves (\\"The Stuff\\"), despite his physical abuse. The Lecturer brings us now to the five and dime, a local teen hangout where wholesome kids indulge in the risqu√© rhythms of swing-jazz music, as performed by Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, and other \\"ginger-colored agents of evil\\" (\\"Down at the Ol' Five and Dime\\"). The Lecturer assumes the guise of kindly Mr. Poppy, the singing and dancing proprietor. Jack, trolling for youthful victims, arrives at the five and dime, where he meets Jimmy and lures him back to the Reefer Den under the pretense of offering him swing dancing lessons. There, Jimmy encounters Ralph, a psychotic ex-college student who communicates primarily with cackling, maniacal laughter. He also meets Sally, a reefer slut who both supports her illegitimate baby and pays for her habit with the only currency she possesses - her generously proportioned body. Jimmy is pressured into taking his first hit of marihuana (\\"Jimmy Takes a Hit\\") and tastes the forbidden fruits of sensual abandon in a wild hallucinatory dance sequence featuring weird sex, belly dancers, fire eaters, and Goat-Man, a frightening satyr played by the Lecturer (\\"The Orgy\\"). Over the next few weeks, we watch Jimmy make a terrifying transition from \\"good egg\\" to \\"bad apple\\". He mouths off to his parents, brutalizes a puppy, and even attempts to tongue-kiss a shocked Mary, sending her running off in tears. Alone in church, Mary prays that her sweetheart will regain his senses and return to her (\\"Lonely Pew\\"). Later, Jimmy and Ralph break into the church to steal from the poor box. While Ralph goes off to smoke some frankincense, Jimmy suddenly receives a heavenly vision...Jesus Christ himself! Flanked by a chorus of singing cherubim, Jesus (played by Jack) warns Jimmy (in a Tom Jones-style production number) to kick his reefer habit or suffer eternal damnation (\\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\\"). Jimmy scoffs at the Son of God's message. Angels weep. Back at the Reefer Den, Jimmy is completely out of control. A desperate Mae warns Jimmy to avoid her own mistakes - he must escape the Reefer Den while he is still able. The drug- addled Jimmy won't listen. Even the revelation that Sally has sold her baby for drug money fails to snap him out of it. Sally's baby (played by Ralph) appears and sings a plaintive solo (\\"Lullaby\\"). Jimmy's bad behavior culminates with his stealing Mary's Packard and taking it for a reckless, reefer-induced joyride with Sally. His joy, however, proves short-lived - Sally, who is driving, runs over a helpless old man crossing the street, killing him. Finally shocked out of his reefer haze, Jimmy returns the stolen Packard to Mary's house and apologizes to her, pledging his love (\\"Mary Jane/Mary Lane\\".) They kiss. Before he can give her his school ring as a token of his undying love, a siren sounds in the distance. The fugitive Jimmy realizes that he must get far away from Mary lest he bring her down with him. He runs off into the night with no explanation. Mary doesn't know the exact nature of Jimmy's demons, but she vows he will not face them alone. She drives her Packard into the night in search of \\"her poor lost Romeo\\". Meanwhile, back at the Reefer Den, Jack and Mae hear a radio broadcast announcing the hit-and- run accident. Police are looking for a young man in a late-model Packard. Jack, fearing Jimmy will get arrested and lead the cops back to him, grabs a pistol and ominously vows to bring Jimmy back to the Reefer Den - \\"one way or another\\" (\\"Act I Finale\\"). =Act II= As the act begins, hallucinatory visions of Ralph, Sally and Mae appear as Jazz Trio Backup Girls (\\"Jimmy on the Lam\\"). The Lecturer brings us up to date - Jimmy's on the lam and Mary's \\"combing the rain-spattered streets in search of her wayward young man.\\" Jimmy arrives at the local train station and attempts to purchase a one-way ticket for \\"Parts Unknown\\". Before Jimmy can board the train, Jack appears and tries to convince Jimmy to return to the Reefer Den with him. Jimmy refuses; he promised himself he'd never smoke marijuana again. Jack tricks Jimmy by offering him a seemingly innocent brownie. Jimmy thinks this is the best brownie he's ever eaten in his life. The train station patrons join him in a song extolling the many virtues of said brownie (\\"The Brownie Song\\"). Jimmy is hooked once again. Meanwhile, Mary makes inquiries at the five and dime. Kindly Mr. Poppy provides Mary with the address of the Reefer Den. The naive Mary leaves, grateful for Mr. Poppy's assistance. As soon as Mary is out of earshot, Mr. Poppy telephones the Reefer Den and tells Ralph to inform Jack that an unsuspecting new \\"client\\" is on her way over. We learn that Mr. Poppy is secretly on Jack's payroll. He helps Jack \\"trundle little children off to pay the wages of sin\\" (\\"Five and Dime\\" reprise). Back at the Reefer Den, Sally drags Jimmy upstairs for a weed-whacked sexual liaison. When Mary arrives looking for Jimmy, the lecherous Ralph is lying in wait. He tries to seduce Mary by tricking her into smoking marijuana herself (\\"Little Mary Sunshine\\"). The plan backfires - the power of the weed is so great, it immediately transforms the virginal Mary into a whip-cracking sadomasochist who enslaves the frightened Ralph. Upon discovering Mary and Ralph in a compromising position, a smoke-addled Jimmy attacks Ralph. A scuffle ensues. Jimmy is knocked unconscious and Jack accidentally shoots Mary through the heart. The villainous Jack places the gun in the unconscious Jimmy's hand. Jimmy, who remembers nothing, is convinced that he has murdered his beloved \\"Juliet\\". Mary regains consciousness long enough for Jimmy to finally give her his school ring. She dies in his arms (\\"Mary's Death\\"). As the police pull up in front of the house, Mae tells Jimmy that he's innocent of the crime and that Jack is planning to frame him. A police inspector (played by the Lecturer) bursts in. Jack accuses Jimmy of murdering Mary while \\"hopped up\\" on reefer. Jimmy begs Mae to tell the truth and exonerate him. Mae, however, is too weak and too dependent on the \\"stuff\\" Jack gives her. She remains silent and Jimmy is dragged away to stand trial. A few weeks later. Ralph, Mae, and Sally are racked with guilt as they listen to Winchell announce Jimmy Harper's conviction and death sentence. Ralph, who has been smoking non-stop, is becoming seriously unhinged. He sees hallucinatory visions: the ghost of doomed Jimmy, dead Mary in Hell being sodomized by the Devil, and the zombie remnants of all the kids destroyed by reefer. Imaginary reefer vines drop from the ceiling, ensnaring him. All the while, Ralph, stricken with a severe case of the munchies, moans about starving to death. Fearing that Ralph's insane caterwauling will prompt a neighbor to call the cops, Jack and Mae leave to get Ralph something to eat. Sally is instructed to remain behind and keep Ralph quiet. When Jack and Mae return with Chinese food, they catch Ralph in the act of gnawing on Sally's severed arm - he has eaten Sally alive! Ralph, now a cackling reefer-fueled cannibal, turns on Mae and Jack. Jack shoots Ralph repeatedly. He dies laughing. The shock of all this causes Mae's mind to snap - she's surrounded by the angry visions of Ralph, Sally, Mary, Goat-Man, Jimmy, and the Zombies (\\"Murder!\\"). Jack warns the unhinged Mae that the world is kill or be killed; \\"the winner is the last one left alive.\\" Mae decides the only way to find inner peace is to turn herself in and save Jimmy from the electric chair. Jack tries to bring Mae back to her senses in his usual fashion - by giving her a smoke. Mae stubs it out. An angry Jack slaps her for wasting \\"half a jay of good mooter\\". Mae reacts with cold fury and picks up a hoe from the victory garden. Frightened by Mae's intensity, Jack tries to shoot her - alas, he expended all his bullets on Ralph! Mae sings as she slashes Jack with the garden hoe, avenging the deaths of Sally, Ralph, Mary, and every other poor kid Jack has ever hooked on marijuana (\\"The Stuff\\" reprise). Fountains of blood spray over the stage. Finally, Mae runs off to save Jimmy. Meanwhile, in an execution chamber, Jimmy walks the last mile and is strapped into the electric chair. Just as the Switch-Puller (played by Ralph) prepares to fry Jimmy, he is interrupted by a second visit from Jesus and his backup angels! They sing and dance (\\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\\" reprise). Jimmy's immense relief is short-lived. It turns out Jesus has only come to gloat and watch the execution. Jimmy prepares to meet his fate - when a second interruption occurs. This time it is Mae, who has obtained a Presidential pardon from none other than President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (played by the Lecturer). President Roosevelt charges Jimmy with a sacred trust: to go forth into the land and warn other children to beware the dangers of reefer. The President promises Jimmy plenty of help getting the message out. The government will use the power of radio, the papers of William Randolph Hearst, and powerful iconography: Uncle Sam, George Washington, and Lady Liberty (played by Ralph, Jack and Sally respectively). This Patriotic Trio joins the group in a rousing production number, chock-full of American iconography (\\"Tell 'Em the Truth\\"). During the song, Jimmy leads the townspeople back to the Reefer Den and builds a gigantic bonfire to immolate bales of marijuana and other \\"dangerous items\\". Mary appears dressed as an angel, freed from Hell by Jimmy's heroic destruction of property, and ascends to heaven while vowing to wait in Heaven for Jimmy until he gets cancer or hit by a train. The crowd sings: :And once the reefer has been destroyed :We'll start on Darwin and Sigmund Freud :And sex depicted on celluloid :And communists and queens! The triumphant Lecturer comments: :When danger's near :Exploit their fear - :The end will justify the means!

They include: * \\"We Know Best\\" - Jimmy's parents (played by the Lecturer and Mae) lecture him on the dangers of marijuana, using racially tinged examples from papers owned by William Randolph Hearst and praising the newspaperman. They then gather neighbors and other adults together to give Jimmy a dose of corporal punishment so he will remember not to think for himself. Cut two weeks into the original run in Los Angeles. * \\"The Monkey Song\\" - Jimmy, alone on the streets, suffering from withdrawal, has a hallucination where he boxes the literal Monkey on his Back (his addiction) in a match refereed by Sally. Cut towards the end of the LA Run when the show was substantially rewritten in preparation for its move to New York and replaced with \\"The Brownie Song.\\" * \\"The Trial\\" - Jimmy's trial, where he is condemned by both the Prosecution (the Lecturer) and the Defense (Ralph) for his \\"Reefer Madness\\" and sentenced to death by the Judge (Jack). Cut towards the end of the LA Run when the show was substantially rewritten in preparation for its move to New York. * \\"Dead Old Man\\" - Jimmy mourns the Old Man he has run down with Mary's Packard. Cut from the film version of the show, and replaced by \\"Mary Jane/Mary Lane\\" both there and in the licensing script. * a finale reprise of \\"Reefer Madness\\" in which all the dead characters, (the entire cast, barring the Lecturer) rise from the grave and recite ridiculous morals about how Reefer has ruined them. Cut for the film version. Evolution In 1998, writing partners Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, who had met while studying at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, were driving from Oakland to Los Angeles and listening to Frank Zappa's \\"Joe's Garage\\", when they began discussing how one might stage the piece. \\"So I started picturing it in my head,\\" Studney recalls. \\"Frank Zappa's concept of a musical and then it just hit me. I turned to Kevin and said 'What about doing Reefer Madness as a musical?'\\" By the time duo reached Los Angeles, they had already written the first song. Upon completion of the script, they approached award-winning director Andy Fickman, who accepted the project with great enthusiasm. \\"I was a big fan of the original movie, it always made me laugh,\\" Fickman explains. \\"Then I listened to Dan and Kevin warbling away on the demo track, which didn't made me laugh, it made me cry. But the music was great and I thought, 'God, if real singers were singing that.' And then when I read the script, I fell in love with it.\\" The play opened in a small equity waiver theater in Los Angeles for what the producers thought might be a two-week run. Instead it played to packed houses for over a year and a half, captivating audiences and critics alike, winning 20 theater awards and breaking records. Many devoted fans came back time and again, dressed in costumes and shouting out the lines.How the Madness Began Near the end of the original Los Angeles run, a number of major changes to the show were made:Reefer Madness!: FAQ * Mary's ballad, \\"Lonely Pew\\", was added to the first act. * The Lecturer was given a bump-and-grind pole dance reprise of \\"Five and Dime\\". * \\"The Trial\\" was deleted. * Mary's dying moments triggered a sad reprise of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" for the lovers. * A long Act Two book scene in which Sally and Ralph are killed was musicalized into the up-tempo ensemble number \\"Murder!\\" * The show's ending in which Jimmy is electrocuted and Mae jumps out a window when she is unable to save him, followed by a scene where all the dead characters recite ridiculous-but-real quotes was cut and replaced with the ending as described above. * \\"The Orgy\\" was revamped with new choreography by Paula Abdul. Soon afterward, the Los Angeles production shuttered in preparation for the move to Off-Broadway. At this point, Murphy and Studney made some additional changes to the text. Here are the major ones: * \\"The Monkey Song\\", wherein a hallucinatory vision of Sally judges a boxing match between Jimmy and the literal monkey on his back, was replaced with \\"The Brownie Song\\". * A solo counterpoint by Jack was added to the \\"Act One Finale\\" to heighten the tension at the first-act break. * The Act Two opening \\"Jimmy on the Lam\\" was given a conceptual overhaul which added Ralph, Mae, and Sally as a jazz backup trio and set up \\"The Brownie Song\\". * The muezzin duet in \\"The Orgy\\" was cut due to the lack of performers who could sing that high. * The ending of the ‚ÄúJesus (Reprise)‚Äù was changed to provide a better applause button. * The Lecturer's pole dance number was cut in New York previews, due to the absence of a pole. Kevin and Dan then adapted ‚ÄúReefer‚Äù for the screen. Their screenplay made many changes to the plot and the score. Adjustments to the score included: * Lyric revisions in existing songs ‚ÄúFive & Dime,‚Äù ‚ÄúOrgy,‚Äù ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù and ‚ÄúTell ‚ÄòEm the Truth‚Äù. * The Five & Dime‚Äôs Mr. Poppy was given a sex change and became Miss Poppy to create a role for Neve Campbell. * The muezzin duet returned to ‚ÄúThe Orgy.‚Äù * ‚ÄúDead Old Man‚Äù was replaced with ‚ÄúMary Jane/Mary Lane.‚Äù This was done because Kevin & Dan felt the former was a visually static solo. That kind of number works better on stage than on film. They thought ‚ÄúMJ/ML‚Äù would be more visually interesting. * ‚ÄúAct One Finale‚Äù and ‚ÄúJimmy On the Lam‚Äù were deleted because there is no need to build to an act break and reset the action after intermission in the continuous medium of film. * The reprise of ‚ÄúListen to Jesus‚Äù was deleted (to keep things moving along). * In the stage version, the reprise of ‚ÄúReefer Madness‚Äù has different lyrics. In the movie, the end credit reprise of the title song has a different arrangement, but uses the same lyrics as the version that appears earlier in the film. After the movie was released, Dan and Kevin proved unable to resist the temptation to fiddle with the show one more time. Here are the major changes from the NYC stage version: * Many plot and lyric revisions made for the movie were retroactively written into the stage show. These changes include Sally driving the car that kills the old man, a happy ending (of sorts) for Mae and Jimmy, Mary‚Äôs ascension to heaven, Ralph joining Jimmy for the church break-in scene, and the bonfire sequence. * Mr. Poppy is once again all man, and played by the Lecturer. * ‚ÄúMary Jane/Mary Lane‚Äù now permanently replaces ‚ÄúDead Old Man.‚Äù * ‚ÄúFive and Dime (Reprise)‚Äù was reinstated. * The final reprise of ‚ÄúReefer Madness‚Äù was cut. ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù now ends the show.

It is a film adaptation of the trio's 1998 musical of the same name, itself based on the 1936 exploitation film also of the same title. It premiered on Showtime on April 16, 2005. The film stars Kristen Bell, Christian Campbell, and John Kassir reprising their stage roles, with the notable addition of Alan Cumming and Ana Gasteyer in other lead roles. Robert Torti, who played the characters of both Jack and Jesus onstage, portrays only the latter in this version. Plot In a small middle-America town in 1936, a group of parents have been gathered by a mysterious Lecturer for an assembly. The ominous Lecturer informs the parents that he has come to warn them about the evils of marijuana on their youth (\\"Reefer Madness\\") through the tragic tale of one boy's struggles with the demon weed in a film titled \\"Tell Your Children\\". Throughout the film, the Lecturer stops to detail a political point or to condescend any audience member questioning his credibility. Jimmy Harper and Mary Lane, a joyful teen couple, blissfully enjoy each other's company (\\"Romeo & Juliet\\"), unaware of the seedy goings-on in The Reefer Den across town. This is the residence of Mae, who is abused by her boyfriend, Jack, a street tough who supplies her and others with dope (\\"The Stuff\\"). Mary, Jimmy and their school friends head to Miss Poppy's Five and Dime, (\\"Down at the Ol' Five and Dime\\"). Jack appears at the hangout, offering Jimmy swing lessons to impress Mary. Jimmy is taken to the Reefer Den, where Jack, Mae, college dropout Ralph and neighborhood slut Sally pressure him into smoking his first joint, leading him to a hallucination of an insidious bacchanal. (\\"Jimmy Takes a Hit/ The Orgy\\"). Jimmy turns into a crazed addict and neglects Mary, leading her to pray for him (\\"Lonely Pew\\"). While breaking into a church to steal collection money, Jimmy has a vision of Jesus Christ in a Vegas-esque Heaven, telling him to change his ways or be sent to eternal damnation (\\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\\"). Jimmy refuses to heed the word of God and continues to spiral into sin. One night, Jimmy and Sally take a joy ride in Mary's stolen car while buzzed, running over an old man. Jimmy runs to Mary, debating whether to continue being under the influence or repent his ways (\\"Mary Jane/ Mary Lane\\"). Jimmy returns to Mary romantically, but he realizes that he is putting her in danger and tells her that he must leave town without her. Jack brings him back to the Reefer Den with a pot-brownie, putting him in a cartoonized trip (\\"The Brownie Song\\"). Mary follows Jimmy to the Den where Ralph seduces her by convincing her that Jimmy has joined his \\"fraternity\\". He suggests that they celebrate with a smoke, which turns out to be a toke. This intro to reefer immediately turns Mary into a sadistic dominatrix who terrorizes Ralph for pleasure (\\"Little Mary Sunshine). Jimmy enters and a fight ensues. Jack stops the fight, knocks out Jimmy and accidentally shoots Mary. He frames an unconscious Jimmy for the crime. Jimmy gives Mary his class ring, and comforts her as she dies in his arms (\\"Mary's Death\\"). Jimmy is taken away by police. Racked with guilt, Ralph has pot-induced hallucinations of Jimmy as a ghost, Mary as Satan's sodomy pal and the children who got hooked on the Reefer Gang's dope as the living dead. Ralph gets an extreme case of the munchies and cannibalizes Sally. Jack shoots Ralph to stop him (\\"Murder!\\"). Seeing similar visions, Mae realizes the error of her ways and tells Jack to do the same. He rejects her pleas and she bludgeons him to death with a garden hoe, gaining her much-needed empowerment (\\"The Stuff (Reprise)\\"). Mae pleads to the visiting President about Jimmy's case, earning the boy a presidential pardon. Jimmy, Mae, the President and Jimmy's fellow prisoners, Ralph, Jack, and Sally (reincarnated as Uncle Sam, George Washington, and Lady Liberty respectively) raise the American justice system and patriotism (\\"Tell 'Em the Truth\\"). Jimmy burns down the Reefer Den's weed garden, freeing Mary from both Hell and Satan before everyone's eyes. The Lecturer's film ends with Mary entering Heaven, greeted by Jesus and other Holy souls. The entire audience joins the suddenly real film cast to hold a huge anti-reefer book burning pledging to join the fight against marijuana, sex, racial and ethnic minorities and other things harmful to their dear country (\\"Finale\\"). The Lecturer drives off, pleased that he has succeeded in exploiting everyone's biases.

I turned to Kevin and said 'What about doing Reefer Madness as a musical?'\\" By the time duo reached L.A., they had already written the first song. The high school is named after Harry J. Anslinger, the first Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, known as the Father of the Drug War. Release Reefer Madness premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. It also screened in competition at the 2005 Deauville Film Festival and won the Premiere Audience Award. On April 20, four days following the film's television premiere, Showtime aired the musical back-to-back with the 1936 exploitation film that inspired it. =Home media= Showtime released the DVD on November 9, 2005. The DVD includes the original film and an audio commentary by director Fickman with several cast members. The DVD case itself also smelled of brownies. =Accolades= The film won the 2005 Emmy Award for Music and Lyrics (for \\"Mary Jane/Mary Lane\\", which was written specially for the film). It also received Emmy nominations for Choreography and Make-Up Effects. Soundtrack A soundtrack CD was first released by Showtime in their \\"stash box\\" press package. Mixed from the 5.1 audio masters, this version has several anomalies including a few sound effects. On October 28, 2008, Ghostlight Records released a double CD of the soundtrack from the film and original Los Angeles cast recording. The night before, The Public Theater's Joe's Pub hosted a release party concert featuring a four-person ensemble and leads Alan Cumming, Ana Gasteyer, Christian Campbell, John Kassir, Robert Torti, Amy Spanger, and Jenna Leigh Green doing an abbreviated concert version with introductions to each song by Kevin Murphy. The two versions of the soundtrack differ in quite a few places, both from each other and from the film, but it is most noticeable during the song Murder. The Showtime CD features a longer version of the song, sans all spoken dialogue. The Ghostlight CD features a truncated version of the track littered with dialogue from the film.

This book is collection of 41 essays by some of the many visiting scientists to the MRC LMB in Cambridge, England, during the period 1957-1986.John Finch; 'A Nobel Fellow On Every Floor', Medical Research Council 2008, 381 pp, ; this book is all about the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge. He was a graduate in physics from Christ's College, Cambridge. However, his education was interrupted for five years by the Second World War, during which he served in the Royal Air Force. His contribution to development of radar earned him an MBE. Huxley was the first PhD student of Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council at Cambridge, where he worked on X-ray diffraction studies on muscle fibres. In the 1950s he was one of the first to use electron microscopy to study biological specimens. During his postdoctoral at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he, with fellow researcher Jean Hanson, discovered the underlying principle of muscle movement, popularised as the sliding filament theory in 1954. After 15 years of research, he proposed the \\"swinging cross-bridge hypothesis\\" in 1969, which became modern understanding of the molecular basis of muscle contraction, and much of other cellular motility. Huxley worked at University College London for seven years, and at Laboratory of Molecular Biology for fifteen years, where he was its Deputy Director from 1979. Between 1987 and 1997, he was professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, where he spent the rest of his life as emeritus professor. Education Huxley studied physics at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1941. During his second year, his education was interrupted by the Second World War, and he joined the Royal Air Force as a radar officer. He worked on the development of radar equipment for during 1943 to 1947, for which he was later honoured a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). His expertise in mechanical and electrical devices became useful throughout his scientific career. After completing his service, he returned to Cambridge for his final year, and he received his BA in physics in 1948. The war had completely diminished his interest in physics, particularly on the horrors of atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He therefore joined Cambridge University to become the first PhD student in a newly formed Laboratory of Molecular Biology, then a small Medical Research Council MRC unit founded by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, who supervised him. (The LMB was then a small \\"hut\\" near the famous Cavendish Laboratory.) He was initially given X-ray analysis of proteins, but he turned to muscle. (The protein study was given to the other student Francis Crick, of the eventual DNA fame.) From there he earned his PhD in 1952 in molecular biology. For his thesis titled Investigations in Biological Structures by X-Ray Methods. The Structure of Muscle, he used low-angle, X-ray scattering of live muscle fibers. Career Following his PhD, Huxley continued research on the structure and function of muscle. Since Cambridge did not have electron microscopy, which began to be used for biological studies at the time, he went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral fellow on a Commonwealth Fellowship in late summer of 1952. He work in F. O. Schmitt's laboratory where he was joined by Jean Hanson in 1953. Their collaboration proved to be fruitful as they discovered the so-called \\"sliding filament theory\\" of muscle contraction. Their publication in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature became a landmark in muscle physiology. He returned to MRC unit of Cambridge in the late spring of 1954. Using X-ray diffraction he found the molecular interaction in the muscle fibres. The LMB was then equipped with electron microscope, but still had technical issues. Knowing his potential the University College London appointed him to the faculty, and moved there to join Bernard Katz's biophysics department in 1955. For his purpose he was bought a new electron microscope with fund from the Wellcome Trust. His innovative contribution was making a modified version of thin-sectioning microtome, by which he could make histological sections of only 100‚Äì150 √Ö in thickness. Based on his LMB X-ray diffraction images, the new technique immediately helped him to establish the cross-bridge concept (interaction site of the muscle proteins, myosin and actin). As the MRC unit was enlarged he was invited back in 1962, with a research fellowship at King's College for five years and then a more permanent one at Churchill College. He became the joint Head of the Structural Studies Division of the LMB in 1975, and its Deputy Director in 1979. In 1969, on the basis of his work over more than 15 years, he finally formulated the \\"swinging cross-bridge hypothesis\\" of muscle contraction, which is the molecular basis of muscle contraction. The concept itself became directly fundamental to other types of cell motility. In 1987 he joined the biology faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he also served as Director of the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, and becoming emeritus from 1997 until his death. Awards and honours He was made an MBE in 1948. He was elected member of Fellow of the Royal Society in 1960 (the youngest member at that time) and also won one of its Royal Medals in 1977 and its Copley Medal in 1997. He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1971. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences appointed him as a Foreign Associate in 1978. He also received the William Bate Hardy Prize in 1966, Antonio Feltrinelli Prize, E. B. Wilson Medal of the American Society for Cell Biology in 1983, and the Franklin Medal in 1990. He was conferred the Albert Einstein World Award of Science in 1987 for his contributions to molecular biology, notably his classic work in the field of muscle biology. Huxley was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. He was among the 43 scientists and philosophers who signed the BHA letter in March 2002 to Prime Minister Tony Blair deploring the teaching of creationism in schools. He also advocated Charles Darwin‚Äôs birthday as public holiday, and curricular reforms in elementary science education. Death Huxley died of heart attack on 25 July 2013 in his home in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He is survived by his wife, Frances, his daughter, Olwen, and stepchildren, Bill, Glenway, and Amy Fripp. References External links *Hugh Huxley's Short Talk: \\"How Muscle Contracts\\" Category:1924 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Brandeis University faculty Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Academics of University College London Category:English biologists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:British humanists Category:Royal Medal winners Category:Recipients of the Copley Medal Category:Albert Einstein World Award of Science Laureates Category:People from Birkenhead ","title":"Hugh Huxley"},{"id":"3383300","title":"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)"},{"id":"3383315","text":"A messabout is an event where a group of people get together to discuss and \\"mess about\\" in boats.

The film was shot entirely in Warsaw, Poland, and was the first of a long string of direct-to-video films released starring Seagal from 2003 to 2009. The film recouped its budget from US home video market alone. Plot Jonathan \\"Jon\\" Cold (Steven Seagal) is a former \\"foreigner\\", or deep cover operative who now works as a freelance agent who is frequently commissioned to deliver high-risk packages. As Jon prepares for his father's funeral, Alexander Marquet (Philip Dunbar) asks him to take on an assignment. Jon is keen to leave the business, but he reluctantly accepts the job. His task is to take a mysterious package from France to a wealthy man in Germany. But Jon will soon find that there are a lot of people who are determined to prevent him from doing so. Jon is accompanied by Dunoir (Max Ryan) to a farmhouse to pick up the package, and they are attacked by assassins. Jon fights them off and decides to continue with the assignment. Leaving Dunoir behind in France, Jon heads for his father Jackson's memorial service in Warsaw, Poland, and Jon meets up with his brother Sean (Jeffrey Pierce) before continuing on to Germany. The package turns out to contain a black box flight recorder from an aircraft that had been suspiciously downed, and the recipient ‚Äì sinister industrialist Jerome Van Aken (Harry Van Gorkum) ‚Äì has a vested interest in it.

It travels through Banff National Park and Jasper National Park and is maintained by Parks Canada for its entire length. It runs from the British Columbia border at Vermilion Pass in the south, where it becomes British Columbia Highway 93, to its terminus at the junction with the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16) at Jasper.Alberta Official Road Map (Map) (2015 ed.).

Route description  = Banff-Windermere Highway = Castle Mountain, in Banff National Park, as seen from Highway 93. The southern portion of the route is part of the Banff-Windermere Highway, a highway that travels from British Columbia Highway 95 at Radium Hot Springs, through Kootenay National Park and Vermilion Pass across the Continental Divide, to the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) at Castle Junction. The final of the highway are in Alberta and Banff National Park. Prior to 1959, the highway was designated as Highway 1B. = Trans-Canada Highway = Highway 93 connects with the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) at Castle Junction, midway between Banff and Lake Louise. Highway 93 follows the Trans-Canada Highway for northwest, diverging from highway 1 west of Lake Louise. Highway 1 continues west to Yoho National Park. The Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A) also links Lake Louise and Banff. This road parallels Highway 1 and, at the midpoint, passes Castle junction where it links with Highway 93. = Icefields Parkway = The Icefields Parkway (), is a long scenic road that parallels the Continental Divide, traversing the rugged landscape of the Canadian Rockies, travelling through Banff National Park and Jasper National Park. It is named for features such as the Columbia Icefield, visible from the parkway. It links Lake Louise with Jasper to the north. At its southern end, the Icefields Parkway terminates at Highway 1\\\\. Highway 1 west leads to Yoho National Park in British Columbia and Highway 1 east to Lake Louise and the Town of Banff. A second parkway, the Bow Valley Parkway also links Lake Louise and the Town of Banff. Known as Highway 1A, this road parallels Highway 1 and, at the midpoint, passes the Castle Mountain junction where Highway 93 south, or the Banff-Windermere Highway, branches southwest into Kootenay National Park in British Columbia. The Icefields Parkway was predated by the Glacier Trail, which opened in 1885 after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed and brought increased tourist traffic to Banff National Park. In 1931, the federal government commissioned the construction of a single-track road between Lake Louise and Jasper in the Great Depression as a relief project. In order to employ as many people as possible, the road was constructed by hand and employed 600 men. The road was completed in 1940; however, the 1950s saw an increase in automobile use and increased traffic along the parkway. In 1961, a reconstructed paved and modern highway was opened. Turnouts by the Parkway aid views The parkway is busy in July and August with up to 100,000 vehicles a month. The parkway is mainly two lanes with occasional passing lanes. It minimizes grades and hairpin turns but travellers must look out for wildlife, and vehicles stopped on the shoulder. Snow can be expected at any time of year and extreme weather is common in winter. A Canadian national parks permit is required to travel on the Icefields Parkway; stations near Lake Louise and Jasper enforce the law. Commercial trucks are prohibited. The speed limit is although the limit is reduced at Saskatchewan River Crossing and the Columbia Icefield area. In winter, chains or winter-rated radial tires are required by law and road closures may occur without warning. There is no cell coverage.  Major intersections  Starting from the south end of Highway 93:  Highway 93A  Just south of Jasper, a short spur of the parkway branches off as Highway 93A, providing access to businesses on the south side of Jasper and providing an alternative route into the community via Hazel Avenue. Another Highway 93A spur farther south is long, is along Highway 93 and provides alternative access to viewpoints and other attractions within Jasper National Park. Highway 93A south of Jasper is narrow and the pavement uneven, with an average limit of . Brush grows up to the side of the highway so animals can be difficult to see.

Some VDCs also generate an audio signal, but that is not their main function. VDCs were used in the home computers of the 1980s and also in some early video picture systems. The VDC is the main component of the video signal generator logic, responsible for generating the timing of video signals such as the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals and the blanking interval signal. Sometimes other supporting chips were necessary to build a complete system, such as RAM to hold pixel data, ROM to hold character fonts, or some discrete logic such as shift registers. Most often the VDC chip is completely integrated in the logic of the main computer system, (its video RAM appears in the memory map of the main CPU), but sometimes it functions as a coprocessor that can manipulate the video RAM contents independently Video display controller vs. graphics processing unit The difference between a display controller, a graphics accelerator, and a video compression/decompression IC is huge, but, since all of this logic is usually found on the chip of a graphics processing unit and is usually not available separately to the end-customer, there is often much confusion about these very different functional blocks. GPUs with hardware acceleration started appearing during the 1990s. VDCs often had special hardware for the creation of \\"sprites\\", a function that in more modern VDP chips is done with the \\"Bit Blitter\\" using the \\"Bit blit\\" function. One example of a typical video display processor is the \\"VDP2 32-bit background and scroll plane video display processor\\" of the Sega Saturn. Another example is the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) chip that was used for the improved graphics of the later generation Amiga computers. That said, it is not completely clear when a \\"video chip\\" is a \\"video display controller\\" and when it is a \\"video display processor\\". For example, the TMS9918 is sometimes called a \\"video display controller\\" and sometimes a \\"video display processor\\". In general however a \\"video display processor\\" has some power to \\"process\\" the contents of the video RAM (filling an area of RAM for example), while a \\"video display controller\\" only controls the timing of the video synchronization signals and the access to the video RAM. The graphics processing unit (GPU) goes one step further than the VDP and normally also supports 3D functionality. This is the kind of chip that is used in modern personal computers. Types Video display controllers can be divided in several different types, listed here from simplest to most complex; *Video shifters, or \\"video shift register based systems\\" (there is no generally agreed upon name for these type of devices), are the most simple type of video controllers. They are directly or indirectly responsible for the video timing signals, but they normally do not access the video RAM directly. They get the video data from the main CPU, a byte at a time, and convert it to a serial bitstream, hence the technical name \\"video shifter\\". This serial data stream is then used together with the synchronization signals to output a video signal. The main CPU needs to do the bulk of the work. Normally these chips only support a very low resolution raster graphics mode. * A CRTC, or cathode-ray tube controller, generates the video timings and reads video data from RAM attached to the CRTC to output it via an external character generator ROM (for text modes) or directly to the video output shift register (for high resolution graphics modes). Because the actual capabilities of the video generator depend to a large degree on the external logic, video generator based on a CRTC chip can have a wide range of capabilities, from simple text-mode only systems to high-resolution systems supporting a wide range of colours. Sprites, however, are normally not supported by these systems. *Video interface controllers are much more complex than CRT controllers, and the external circuitry that is needed with a CRTC is embedded in the video controller chip. Sprites are often supported, as are (RAM based) character generators and video RAM dedicated to colour attributes and pallette registers (colour lookup tables) for the high-resolution or text modes. *Video coprocessors have their own internal CPU dedicated to reading (and writing) their own video RAM (which may be shared with the CPU), and converting the contents of this video RAM to a video signal. The main CPU can give commands to the coprocessor, for example to change the video modes or to manipulate the video RAM contents. The video coprocessor also controls the (most often RAM-based) character generator, the colour attribute RAM, palette registers, and the sprite logic (as long as these exist of course). List of example VDCs Examples of video display controllers are: Video shifters * The RCA CDP1861 was a very simple chip, built in CMOS technology (which was unusual for the mid-1970s) to complement the RCA 1802 microprocessor, it was mainly used in the COSMAC VIP. It could only support a very low resolution monochrome graphic mode. * The Television Interface Adapter (TIA) is the custom video chip that is the heart of the Atari 2600 games console, a very primitive chip that relied on the 6502 microprocessor to do most of the work, also was used to generate the audio. CRT Controllers * The Intel 8275 CRT controller was not used in any mainstream system, but was used in some S100 bus systems. * The Motorola 6845 (MC6845) is a video address generator first introduced by Motorola and used for the Amstrad CPC, and the BBC Micro. It was also used for almost all the early video adapters for the PC, such as the MDA, CGA and EGA adapters. The MDA and CGA use an actual Motorola chip, while the EGA has a custom IBM chipset of five LSI chips; one of those chips includes IBM's reimplementation of the CRTC, which operates like an MC6845 but differs in a few register addresses and functions so it is not 100% compatible. In all later VGA compatible adapters the function of the 6845 is still reproduced inside the video chip, so in a sense all current IBM PC compatible PCs still incorporate the logic of the 6845 CRTC. Video interface controllers * The Signetics 2636 and 2637 are video controllers best known for their use in the Interton VC 4000 and Emerson Arcadia 2001 respectively. * The MC6847 is a video display generator (VDG) first introduced by Motorola and used in the TRS-80 Color Computer, Dragon 32/64, Laser 200 and Acorn Atom among others. * The MOS Technology 6560 (NTSC) and 6561 (PAL) are known as the video interface controller (VIC) and used in the Commodore VIC-20. * The MOS Technology 6567/8562/8564 (NTSC versions) and 6569/8565/8566 (PAL) were known as the VIC- II and were used in the Commodore 64. * The MOS Technology 8563/8568 was used in the Commodore 128 (8563) and Commodore 128D (8568) to create an 80 column text display, as well as several high resolution graphics modes. The Commodore 128 models included a VIC-II to support Commodore 64 compatible video modes. * The MOS Technology 7360 text editing device (TED) was used in the Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 16 and Commodore 116 computers and had an integrated audio capability. * The NEC ŒºPD7220. Used in some high-end graphics boards for the IBM PC in the mid 80s, notably in products from Number 9 Computer Company. * The Philips semiconductors SCC66470 was a VSC (Video- and Systems Controller) used in conjunction with their 68070-Microcontroller e.g. in CD-i systems. * The Picture Processing Unit was a video coprocessor designed by Ricoh for Nintendo's use in the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System. It was connected to 2048 bytes of dedicated video RAM, and had a dedicated address bus that allowed additional RAM or ROM to be accessed from the game cartridge. A scrollable playfield of 256√ó240 pixels was supported, along with a display list of 64 OBJs (sprites), of which 8 could be displayed per scanline. Video coprocessors *The ANTIC (Alpha-Numeric Television Interface Circuit) was an early video system chip used in the Atari 8-bit family of microcomputers. It could read a \\"Display list\\" with its own built in CPU and use this data to generate a complex video signal. * The TMS9918 is known as the Video Display Processor (VDP) and was first designed for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4, but was later also used in systems like the MSX (MSX-1), ColecoVision, Memotech MTX series, and for the Sega SG-1000 and SC-3000. The Master System uses an enhanced VDP based on the TMS9918, and the Sega 315-5313 (Yamaha YM7101) VDP used in the Sega Genesis and some arcade machines is a further advancement of the Master System VDP with the original (inferior) TMS9918 modes removed. * The Yamaha V9938 is an improved version of the TMS9918, and was mainly used in the MSX2. * The Yamaha V9958 is the Video Display Processor (VDP) mainly used in the MSX2+ and MSX turboR computers. * The VLSI VS21S010D-L is a 128kB SPI/parallel SRAM with an integrated video display controller with variable- bit-depth pixels and a block-move blitter. * The Thomson EF936x series of Graphic Display Processor (GDP), which offers a draw rate of 1 million pixels per second and resolutions up to 1024√ó512. Alternatives to a VDC chip Note that many early home computers did not use a VDP chip, but built the whole video display controller from a lot of discrete logic chips, (examples are the Apple II, PET, and TRS-80). Because these methods are very flexible, video display generators could be very capable (or extremely primitive, depending of the quality of the design), but also needed a lot of components. Many early systems used some form of an early programmable logic array to create a video system; examples include the ZX Spectrum and ZX-81 systems and Elektronika BK-0010, but there were many others. Early implementations were often very primitive, but later implementations sometimes resulted in fairly advanced video systems, like the one in the SAM Coup√©. These systems could thus build a very capable system with relatively few components, but the low transistor count of early programmable logic meant that the capabilities of early PLA- based systems were often less impressive than those using the video interface controllers or video coprocessors that were available at the same time. Later PLA solutions, such as those using CPLDs or FPGAs, could result in much more advanced video systems, surpassing those built using off-the-shelf components. An often-used hybrid solution was to use a video interface controller (often the Motorola 6845) as a basis and expand its capabilities with programmable logic or an ASIC. An example of such a hybrid solution is the original VGA card, that used a 6845 in combination with an ASIC. That is why all current VGA based video systems still use the hardware registers that were provided by the 6845. Modern solutions ATi R300 chip block diagram; the display controller is called \\"display interface\\" With the advancements made in semiconductor device fabrication, more and more functionality is implemented as integrated circuits, often licensable as SIP core. Display controller SIP blocks can be found on the die of GPUs, APUs and SoCs. They support a variety interfaces: VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, VHDCI, DMS-59 and more. The PHY includes LVDS, TMDS and Flat Panel Display Link, OpenLDI and CML. For example, a VGA-signal, which is created by the display controller, is being transported over a VGA-cable to the display. Both ends of the cable end in a VGA connector. Laptops and other mobile computers use different interfaces between the display controller and the display. A display controller usually supports multiple computer display standards. KMS driver is an example of a device driver for display controllers and AMD Eyefinity is a special brand of display controller with multi-monitor support. RandR is a method to configure screen resolution and refresh rate on each individual outputs separately and at the same time configure the settings of the windowing system accordingly. An example for this dichotomy is offered by ARM Holdings: they offer semiconductor intellectual property core for 3D rendering acceleration and for display controller independently. The former has marketing names such as Mali-200 or Mali-T880 while the latter is available as Mali-DP500, Mali-DP550 and Mali-DP650. History In 1982, NEC released the NEC ŒºPD7220, one of the most widely used video display controllers in 1980s personal computers. It was used in the NEC PC-9801, APC III, IBM PC compatibles, DEC Rainbow, Tulip System-1, and Epson QX-10. (Translation of \\"Grafik mit dem 7220 von NEC\\", mc, 1986, H11, pp. 54-65) Intel licensed the design and called it the 82720 graphics display controller. Previously, graphic cards were also called graphic adapters, and the chips used on these ISA/EISA cards consisted solely of a display controller, as this was the only functionality required to connect a computer to a display. Later cards included ICs to perform calculations related to 2D rendering in parallel with the CPU; these cards were referred to as graphics accelerator cards. Similarly, ICs for 3D rendering eventually followed. Such cards were available with VLB, PCI, and AGP interfaces; modern cards typically use the PCI Express bus, as they require much greater bandwidth then the ISA bus can deliver.

During the Afghan Civil War, he captured vast swathes of Afghanistan and ruled Kabul during what is known in historiography as the \\"Saqqawist period\\". He was an ethnic Tajik. No country recognized Kalakani as ruler of Afghanistan. During the Afghan Civil War (1928‚Äì1929), he contested the Afghan throne with Amanullah Khan. After defeating Amanullah, he was eventually defeated by Mohammed Nadir Shah. Khalilullah Khalili, a Kohistani poet laureate, depicts King Habibullah Kalakani as the \\"best manager of governmental imports and exports\\"..  Early years  Habibullah Kalakani was born in either 1891 or 1870 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. He was an ethnic Tajik. In his memoirs, Kalakani stated that his home village was \\"miserable\\" and that he had \\"conceived a deep hatred of its poverty-stricken exterior\\". At age 14, he left for Kabul on horseback with his friends Nur and Jamal. Later, he joined King Amanullah Khan's army, and fought in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost rebellion of 1924. During the latter war, he served as officer with the Royal Army's \\"Model Battalion\\" and served with distinction during the suppression of the insurgents. Nevertheless, he deserted the unit at some unspecified time, and after working in Peshawar moved to Parachinar (on the Afghan border) where he was arrested and sentenced to eleven months imprisonment. Thereafter, Kalakani began a life of Banditry, since he considered the occupations common among the Kuhdamanis, like viticulture and selling firewood, to be beneath him, reasoning that these could hardly ever provide wheat bread for his table. Instead, he began to rob caravans and nearby villages. He was joined by Sayyid Husayn and Malik Muhsin, as well as others, totaling 24 in all. For three years, they lived in mountain caves, venturing out during the day to rob and hiding out at night, all the time fearful of government retaliation. Sometime later, Kalakani fled to Peshawar where he was a tea seller and a petty thief. After British police arrested and jailed an accomplice of his, he fled to Peshawar where he stayed a while, supporting himself by petty theft. Kalakani and his bandit group also murdered Ghulam Ghaws Khan, Governor of Charikar.  Revolt  An animated map of the Afghan Civil War of 1928-1929. Red = Saqqawists, Blue = Anti-Saqqawists. This map does not show the concurrent Soviet war against the Basmachi in northern Afghanistan. While the Afghan National Army was engulfed in battle with Pashtun outlaw tribes in Laghman and Nangarhar in the east of the country, the Saqqawists, led by Kalakani began to attack the unprotected Kabul from the north in 1928. The revolt caught steam and the country was thrown into a civil war. Wild tribesmen from Waziristan had the southern areas of Kabul surrounded, and KalakƒÅni's forces were moving into the heart of Kabul from the north. In the middle of the night, on 14 January 1929, Amanullah Khan handed over his kingdom to his brother Inayatullah Khan and escaped from Kabul towards Kandahar in the south, fearing people's wrath. Two days later, on 16 January 1929, Kalakani wrote a letter to King Inayatullah Khan to either surrender or prepare to fight. Inayatullah Khan responded by explaining that he never wished to become king, and agreed to abdicate.  Kingship  Kalakani with followers The powerful Pashtun tribes, including the Ghilzai, who had initially supported him against Amanullah, chafed under rule by a non-Pashtun. When Amanullah's last feeble attempt to regain his throne failed, those next in line were the Musahiban brothers. They were also from the Mohammedzai and Barakzai family trees, and whose great-grandfather was an older brother of Dost Mohammad. The five prominent Musahiban brothers included Nadir Shah, the eldest, who had been AmƒÅnullƒÅh's minister of war. They were permitted to cross through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to enter Afghanistan and take up arms. Once on the other side, however, they were not allowed back and forth across the border to use British-Indian territory as a sanctuary, nor were they allowed to gather together a tribal army on the British side of the Durand Line. However, the Musahiban brothers and the tribes successfully ignored these restrictions. During this period anti-Soviet rebels from Central Asia known as Basmachi utilized the period of instability in Afghanistan to launch raids into the Soviet Union. The Basmachi had taken refuge in Afghanistan earlier in the decade after they were expelled from Soviet Central Asia by the Soviet military and they swore allegiance to the Emir of Bukhara, who lived in exile in Kabul. One of these raids was led by Faizal Maksum, who operated under the command of Basmachi commander Ibrahim Bek. Faizal Maksum's forces briefly captured the town of Gharm until they were expelled by Soviet forces. The Basmachi operated in Afghanistan due to their alliance with Habibullah Ghazi and after his fall from power they were expelled from Afghanistan.Fayz Muhammad, R. D. McChesney. Kabul Under Siege: Fayz Muhammad's Account of the 1929 Uprising. (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1999.)  Death  After several unsuccessful attempts, Nadir and his brothers finally raised a sufficiently large force‚Äîmostly from the British side of the Durand Line‚Äîto take Kabul on 13 October 1929. Nadir considered pardoning Kalakani, but pressure from loyal tribes led him to execute Kalakani on 1 November, 1929. Kalakani's last words prior to being executed were \\"I have nothing to ask God, he has given me everything I desired. God has made me King.\\" His remains were laid below a hilltop mausoleum at an undisclosed location for 87 years, until a campaign in 2016 by some Tajiks and scholars who wanted him to be reburied in a better place. This caused days of political and slight sectarian tensions in Kabul - Tajiks and religious scholars, who consider Kalakani to have been a devout Muslim, wanted him to be buried at the Shahrara hill and asked President Ashraf Ghani to plan a state burial. Opponents to Kalakani, mostly Pashtuns and secularists, were against this plan, including vice-president Abdul Rashid Dostum who claimed that he could not be buried at a hilltop important to Uzbek heritage. He was eventually buried at the hill on September 2, with one death and four injuries in clashes between his supporters and pro- Dostum soldiers.

The ship saw service in the Polish Navy from 1931 to 1951. Her name meant \\"Wolf\\" in Polish. History Wilk was laid down in 1927 at Chantiers et Ateliers Augustin Normand shipyard at Le Havre in France. Launched on April 12, 1929, she was commissioned into the Polish Navy on 31 October 1931.Twardowski, M. When World War II began on September 1, 1939, Wilk, commanded by Captain Boguslaw Krawczyk, took part in the Worek Plan for the defence of the Polish coast, operating in Gda≈Ñsk Bay. On September 2 she spotted a destroyer Erich Steinbrinck, but could not attack it, because she fell herself under attack of minesweepers (the German report on firing a torpedo at Steinbrinck is not confirmed by the Poles).Andrzej S. Bartelski, Rafa≈Ç Mariusz Kaczmarek (in Polish) Polskiej wojny podwodnej ciƒÖg dalszy (Polish submarine warfare - continued), in: Morze, Statki i Okrƒôty nr. 4/2008, p.30-31 On September 3 she deployed her mines as planned. On September 4 and 5 the Wilk was under continuous depth charge attacks and had to lay on the sea bottom during daytime, suffering minor damage. During next days, attempts at attacking enemy shipping were unsuccessful. Then she left the Polish coast, successfully passing the Danish straits (√òresund) on September 14/15, escaping from the Baltic Sea and arriving in Great Britain on September 20. Only ORP Orze≈Ç managed to accomplish the same feat later; the other three Polish submarines were interned in neutral Sweden. On December 7, 1939 one of the mines laid by the submarine in September sank a German fishing boat MFK Pil 55 Heimat (13 GRT) at position . In February, 1940 the ORP Wilk was involved in an incident in the Kattegat. It is reported to have sank a German U-boot, damaged another, and was then depth-charged for thirty hours. The Royal Navy Liaison Officer onboard, Sub.Lt. Cyril Branson R.N., got the Captain to surface and assisted in bringing the badly damaged Wilk safety back to Rosyth.A Lifetime of Deception, Major L.H. Branson (1953). Sub.Lt. Branson was later awarded the Cross of Valour () for his role in this action.London Gazette (21 October 1941) https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35315/page/6083/data.pdf On June 20, 1940 at 0.25 am, the ORP Wilk rammed an unidentified object at position . There was a long dispute upon this incident. The commander reported, that the Wilk had collided with a submarine. The 2nd in command Sub.Lt. Boles≈Çaw Romanowski, being the officer of the watch then, reported, that he had seen a \\"triangular shape\\". However, in his post-war memoires \\"Torpeda w celu\\" he claimed, that he deliberately rammed a German U-boot.Andrzej S. Bartelski (in Polish). Prawdy i mity \\"Torpedy w celu\\" (Facts and myths in \\"Torpedo in target\\"). Biuletyn DWS.org.pl Nr.6, ISSN 2080-5780, p.48-50Andrzej S. Bartelski (in Polish). Tajemnica ataku ORP Wilk (A mystery of ORP Wilk attack). \\"Morze, Statki i Okrƒôty\\" nr 11/2013 (139), p. 30-40 According to new research, the only German submarine in that area was U-99, but it did not report any damage nor encounter with the enemy on that day. The other submarine U-122, lost after 21 June, was too far away. If submarines are considered, most probable would be an Allied Dutch submarine O13, also lost in that area around that time. However, according to newest analysis of Wilk's damages and all reports, the object was most likely German minefield protector buoy (Sprengboje), since only both Wilk's propellers got damaged, while a rudder and rudder's connector below them, were intact, which was unlikely in case of ramming a submarine. Moreover, searching of the O13 wreck in area of the Wilk's reported collision was fruitless. The Wilk undertook nine patrols from the British bases, without success. The last patrol was between 8 and 20 January 1941, then the submarine was assigned to training duties. Due to her poor mechanical shape, ORP Wilk was decommissioned as a reserve submarine on April 2, 1942. On 28 September 1946 ORP Wilk was given under the British control by the Polish Government in Exile. The submarine remained laid up at Harwich. Because of her poor condition, only in October 1952 she was towed to Poland. She was declared unfit to service, decommissioned from the Polish Navy, and scrapped in 1954. A second ORP Wilk, a Foxtrot class submarine, served in the Polish Navy from 1987 to 2003.

He played college football for the University of Southern California, and earned All- American honors. Mosebar was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders. Birthplace Mosebar was born in Yakima, Washington. College career Mosebar was an All-American offensive lineman in 1982 at the University of Southern California and drafted by the Los Angeles Raiders. Raider career Mosebar was chosen by the Los Angeles Raiders as the 26th pick in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft, just ahead of future Hall of Famer Dan Marino. (Team executive Ron Wolf later said \\"To this day I call him 'Dan'‚ÄîDan Mosebar‚Äîbecause we blew Marino, and he knows that.\\") Mosebar immediately moved into the starting lineup as right guard for two years, before succeeding longtime center Dave Dalby upon his retirement. He was only the third starting center in franchise history; Dalby had inherited the center position from Jim Otto, who in turn had been the center since the team's inception in 1960. In the 1986-1994 span, the Raiders reached the playoffs 3 times, in 1990, 1991, and 1993, with Art Shell as head coach. In his Raider career, Mosebar went to the Pro Bowl three times (1986, 1990, and 1991) and was an All-Pro in 1991. With Steve Wisniewski (1989‚Äì2001) on his left and Max Montoya (1990‚Äì1994) on his right, Mosebar anchored a trio of outstanding blockers combining for nine Pro Bowl appearances in the five years they were together (1990‚Äì1994), the span which included Mosebar's three years of playoff action. In the 1990 NFL season, Shell's second year as head coach and first full year, and with Jay Schroeder as the starting quarterback, Los Angeles scored 337 points (21.1 points/game), 13th of 28 teams in the NFL and had a won-lost record of 12-4, winning the west division title of the AFC. The Raiders had beaten the Cincinnati Bengals in their 14th game with 185 rushing yards and now met them in a divisional round of the 1990-91 NFL playoffs. Once again, Mosebar, Wisniewski, and Montoya, with tackles Rory Graves and Steve Wright, overwhelmed the Bengals on the ground, this time with 235 yards. In that game Bo Jackson suffered a career-ending hip injury. Without Jackson, and unable to stop the no-huddle Buffalo Bills offense, the Raiders suffered a ridiculous 51-3 defeat in the AFC championship game. In the 1991 NFL season, Los Angeles scored 298 points (18.6 points/game), 15th of 28 teams in the NFL, win a 9-7 record, 3rd in the AFC west but with a wild card slot in the 1991-92 NFL playoffs, and playing against the Kansas City Chiefs, a game the Raiders lost with the inexperienced Todd Marinovich at quarterback. In the 1992 NFL season, Los Angeles was out of the playoffs with a 7-9 record, but came back stronger during the 1993 NFL season with Jeff Hostetler at starting quarterback, scoring 306 points (19.1 points/game), 14th of 28 teams in the NFL and with a 10-6 record, second in the AFC west but with a wild card game in the 1993-94 NFL playoffs against the Denver Broncos. With the same interior line as in the 90-91 playoffs, but with two new tackles, Gerald Perry and Bruce Wilkerson, the Raiders defeated the Broncos with 427 total yards of offense, but lost to the Bills again the following week, this time in the divisional round In 1994, Mosebar's final year, the Raiders missed the playoffs.

He was appointed as Chief Justice on April 1, 1958, replacing Sir Stafford Foster Sutton who was retiring. Ademola was a son of Oba Sir Ladapo Ademola II, the Alake of the Egba clan of Nigeria. He was the first chancellor of the University of Benin. Early life and education Sir Adetokunbo was born on February 1, 1906, into royalty as the son of Prince Ladapo and Princess Tejumade Ademola. His father was a regent of the Egba United Government in Lagos who later became Ademola II, the Alake of Egbaland, Abeokuta, a historic walled city of the Egbas in south-western Nigeria. His mother was a senior sister to Sir Adeyemo Alakija. At the age of four, he lived briefly with his maternal grandfather, Pa Alakija, in Abeokuta, and a year later he started his primary education at the Roman Catholic School in Itesi, Abeokuta. He moved back to Lagos when he was eight to live with his mother in the family compound on Broad St, and subsequently continued his education at Holy Cross School, Lagos. He attended St Gregory's Grammar School, Obalende and King's College Lagos for his secondary school education. He finished his secondary education in 1925 and passed the Senior Clerical Examination for admission into the colonial Civil Service. He gained appointment as a clerk in the Chief Secretary's office of the National Secretariat, Lagos. From 1928 to 1931, Ademola studied law at Selwyn College, University of Cambridge. From 1958 to 1972, he served as Chief Justice. Career  Sir Adetokunbo was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in London in 1934. After returning to Nigeria and at the insistence of his father, he joined the Civil Service and from 1934-35, he worked as crown counsel in the Office of the Attorney-General. He then joined the unified Nigerian administrative service and for a year, he was posted to Enugu as assistant secretary at the southern secretariat, Eastern Nigeria. He left the service and started a private practice from 1936 until 1939, when he was appointed Magistrate of the Protectorate Court. In 1938, he joined the Nigerian Youth Movement. As a magistrate, he was posted to various Nigerian towns; Ademola worked in Warri from 1939-1946, and then returned to Lagos in 1946 to preside at St Anna Court. In 1947, he was posted to Opobo. In 1949, he became the third Nigerian to be appointed a puisne judge. In 1948 he served as a member of the commission for the revision of court legislation. In 1955, a year before Western Nigeria became internally self-governing, Sir Adetokunbo was appointed Chief Justice for Western Nigeria, thus becoming the first Nigerian head of the judiciary anywhere in the country. His string of 'firsts' continued when, three years later, he became the first Nigerian Chief Justice of the entire Federation of Nigeria. As Chief Justice, he played the role of peacemaker in two political events in the country. In 1964, after the stalemate of national elections, Nnamdi Azikiwe, the president, refused to call any party to form a government until the intervention of Sir Louis Mbanefo, the Chief Justice of the Eastern region and Ademola. He later went on to play a calming role in the aftermath of the 1966 coup when some northern officers wanted to secede from the country. As Chief Justice, Ademola was involved in some notable judgements during his tenure, in both Regina vs Ilorin Native Authority and Ayinke vs Ibidunni, he delved into the issue of customary law. He was also involved in various constitutional cases during the period. Some of the cases are Doherty v Abubakar Balewa, Adesoji Aderemi v Samuel Akintola and Olawoyin vs the Commissioner of Police. Sir Adetokunbo, along with Dr. Teslim Olawale Elias (who succeeded him as Chief Justice of Nigeria), was instrumental in the establishment of the Nigerian Law School. Prior to its establishment, legal practitioners had had to qualify at the English Bar. During Ademola's tenure, the federal government changed from colonial rule to a parliamentary system, then to military rule. Ademola as head of the judiciary was not found wanting as a man respected by his peers and who was able to compromise and accord respect for the judicial branch of government. However, some critics perceived he was lenient towards the executive branch.232 Ademola preferred a unified judiciary. Even though he was once a regional Chief Justice, it did not deter his preference for a unified structure. =Census board= After his retirement from the judiciary, Ademola was appointed chairman of the newly created Nigerian Census Board, a predecessor to the current National Population Commission. The board conducted a national census in 1973 and at the end of the exercise a total provisional figure of 79 million was reported. The figure was rejected by most Southern states who were not happy that the proportion of people resident in the North had a much higher increase from the previous census that those living in the south. When the provisional result was released, Ademola expressed dissatisfaction with the figures blaming dishonesty among census field workers who collaborated with socio-political groups within the communities and felt the public figure was not reliable. =Knighthood, honours and memberships= Adetokunbo Ademola was a prince of the Yoruba people, and thus often made use of the pre-nominal honorific Omoba. He was first knighted in January, 1957, and in 1963 was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Later that year, Queen Elizabeth II awarded him a K.B.E.. By serving as Chief Justice of Nigeria, Sir Adetokunbo was conferred with the title Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger by the federal government of the Republic of Nigeria. Sir Adetokunbo was also a member of the United Nations International Public Service Advisory Board, member of the International commission of Jurists, executive member of World peace through Law, vice president of the World Association of Jurists, president of the Nigerian Red Cross Association, chairman of Nigeria Cheshire homes, member of the International Olympic committee, member of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs and Olori-Oluwo (or Grandmaster) of the Reformed Ogboni Fraternity. In addition to all of this, he was both one of the founders and eventual chairman of the Metropolitan Club, a founding member of the Island Club, and vice patron of the Yoruba Club. Personal life He married the former Miss Kofo Moore, who obtained a BA at Oxford and who was a daughter of the late Eric Moore, first Lagos member of the United Nations committee of experts advising on labor conventions and regulations. They had five children.

V.\\" Porter (October 2, 1891 ‚Äì October 27, 1975) was an American educator, coach, and athletic administrator. He served as the executive secretary of the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations from 1940 to 1958, and prior to his appointment managed several Federation projects while still working for the Illinois High School Athletic Association. Porter was involved with several sports but had special influence on basketball. He served with Oswald Tower on the National Basketball Committee of the United States and Canada for 26 years and was instrumental in the development of the rules films, the fan-shaped backboard, and the molded basketball, which replaced the earlier laced model. He is also credited with popularizing the term \\"March Madness\\" through an original essay he wrote in 1939 and a later poem distributed to the various state high school associations and widely republished. In 1960 Porter was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in its second class. Early life H. V. Porter was born on the family farm in Spring Lake Township in Tazewell County, Illinois, near the town of Manito. After attending Illinois State Normal University, he worked as principal at high schools in Mount Zion, Keithsburg, and Delavan, Illinois. From 1919 to 1927 he served as principal of Athens High School, where he gained statewide renown as a basketball coach. His teams finished second in the Illinois state championship tournament in 1924 and fourth in 1926.Illinois Interscholastic, Sept. 1940 At the IHSA In 1927 Porter was hired as assistant manager of the Illinois High School Athletic Association, which was headed by C. W. Whitten. His first duties were to organize a department to license and train officials in football, basketball, and baseball, and to serve as editor of a new monthly magazine, the Illinois High School Athlete. He also initiated state tournament competitions in swimming and wrestling.Illinois Interscholastic, Sept. 1940 Porter's career was helped by Whitten's dual role as executive officer of both the IHSAA and the NFHSHAA. As Whitten's right-hand man, he was appointed to several rules committees as a National Federation representative. Porter joined the National Basketball Committee of the United States and Canada in 1932, serving as the chief high school negotiator with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and other amateur sports organizations. As the committee's secretary and co-editor of the rule book, Porter was at the forefront of the sport's development. In 1931 he began experimenting with motion pictures to develop training material for coaches and officials. In 1934 he was placed in charge of the NFHS effort to develop a molded basketball to replace the expensive sewn models that high school programs could scarcely afford. Porter also spearheaded the development of the fan-shaped backboard that was put into use at the high school level in 1939.Illinois Interscholastic, Sept. 1940 At the National Federation As Whitten prepared to step down as chief executive of both the IHSAA and NFHS in 1940, Porter, his heir apparent at the state association, chose instead to become the first full-time director of the National Federation. As in his previous job, his first order of business was to launch a monthly journal, the National Press Service, which delivered news to member associations, as well as articles and illustrations intended for republication. During Porter's tenure the Federation grew from 26 state associations to 47, with the University Interscholastic League of Texas the only holdout (it finally joined in 1969). Under Porter the National Federation forged an agreement in 1951 with the two major professional baseball leagues that prohibited them from signing high school baseball players until after their class had graduated. The Federation also lobbied successfully to eliminate a federal tax on admissions to school events that would have cost schools on the order of $10 million a year.Illinois Interscholastic, Dec. 1975, p. 159. First and foremost Porter was known as a rules expert. For most of his 18 years as executive secretary of the Federation, Porter was the only executive employee and spent much of his time editing the various sport rule books and speaking to various groups about rules. One particular goal of Porter and the Federation was to forge a joint rule code with the NCAA in football, like the one that had long been in effect in basketball. With Porter as editor, the Federation had written its own football code in 1932 after the NCAA rebuffed the Federation's request for representation on the national rules committee. Efforts to resolve differences with the NCAA failed again in 1936, but in 1947 the parties seemed ready to make another attempt. After more than a year of often acrimonious discussions, the two groups agreed to final language in the summer of 1948, only to have the NCAA pull out of the project after the NFHS had already gone to print with its edition of the joint code.Whitten, p. 162-68. \\"March Madness\\" While he was editor of the IHSAA's magazine, Porter often included some of his own poems and short pieces on athletic topics. Many of these compositions were later published in an independent volume named H.V.'s Athletic Anthology. In 1939, near the end of his run with the IHSAA, he penned an affectionate essay about fans of the state's high school basketball tournament, which had grown significantly in popularity during the 1930s. \\"When the March madness is on him,\\" Porter wrote, \\"midnight jaunts of a hundred miles on successive nights make him even more alert the next day.\\"Illinois High School Athlete, March 1939 Two years later, while in his first year at the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations, Porter wrote a poem entitled \\"Basketball Ides of March,\\" which he included in the National Press Service, the Federation's monthly journal, with a suggestion to state associations to republish the poem during basketball tournament time.National Press Service, February 1941 The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association was the first to do so, in its March 1941 edition.TSSAA News, March 1941 The Illinois High School Association and the Ohio High School Athletic Association published the poem a year later, in March 1942.Illinois Interscholastic, March 1942 \\"Basketball Ides of March\\" ends with the final stanza: > With war nerves tense, the final defense > Is the courage, strength and will > In a million lives where freedom thrives > And liberty lingers still. > Now eagles fly and heroes die > Beneath some foreign arch > Let their sons tread where hate is dead > In a happy Madness of March.Illinois Interscholastic, March 1942 Personal life H. V. Porter married Grace Kromminga, a school teacher, in 1914. The couple had no children. After Porter's retirement in 1958, they relocated to St. Petersburg, Florida, where Porter died in 1975 at the age of 84. His ashes are inurned in the mausoleum of Memorial Park Cemetery in St. Petersburg.Illinois Interscholastic, Dec. 1975, p. 159.

He was born in Sapele, Nigeria; cultural diversity was a recurring theme in his work. He attended St. Cyprian's School in Port Harcourt from 1945 to 1949, St Jude's School, Lagos, from 1951 to 1952 and the Methodist Boys High School in Lagos, before travelling to the United States in 1959 to study at Boston University, where he obtained a BA in fine arts. In 1965, he married Hazel Mae Guadreau, originally from Gloucester; Hazel also studied at Boston University, where she majored in opera, voice and music education. In 1966 he obtained an MA from Yale School of Drama, where he earned the distinction of being a Rockefeller Foundation scholar in playwriting and dramatic literature. = Theatrical career = Rotimi often examined Nigeria's history and local traditions in his works. His first plays, To Stir the God of Iron (produced 1963) and Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again (produced 1966; published 1977), were staged at the drama schools of Boston University and Yale, respectively. = Later years = Upon returning to Nigeria in the 1960s, Rotimi taught at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University), where he founded the Ori Olokun Acting Company,\\"Rotimi, Ola\\", in Martin Banham, Errol Hill & George Woodyard (eds), The Cambridge Guide to African & Caribbean Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 81. and Port Harcourt. Owing, in part, to political conditions in Nigeria, Rotimi spent much of the 1990s living in the Caribbean and the United States, where he taught at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 2000 he returned to Ile-Ife where he lectured in Obafemi Awolowo University till his demise. Hazel (his wife) died in May 2000, only a couple of months before Rotimi's death. His later dramas include The Gods Are Not to Blame (produced 1968; published 1971), a retelling of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex in imaginative verse; Kurunmi and the Prodigal (produced 1969; published as Kurunmi, 1971), written for the second Ife Festival of Arts; Ovonramwen Nogbaisi (produced 1971; published 1974), about the last ruler of the Benin empire; and Holding Talks (1979). Later plays, such as If: A Tragedy of the Ruled (1983) and Hopes of the Living Dead (1988), premiered at the University of Port Harcourt and was a common play in Obafemi Awolowo University Drama Department. The radio play Everyone His/Her Own Problem, was broadcast in 1987. His book African Dramatic Literature: To Be or to Become? was published in 1991. Rotimi, a patriot who shunned the attraction of the West and Europe and returned home to contribute his own quota to nation building, was a rare breed. Diminutive in size but a giant in drama in Africa, he was one of the best things that could have happened to the literary community. His dream of directing a play of 5000 cast members materialised at the Amphi Africa Theater when he was being put to rest as the crowd was drawn to a manuscript of the day's program outline. People made dramatic entry and exit to the stage around his casket with the man turning his casket. Rotimi spent the second half of his last creative decade reworking two of his plays ‚Äì Man Talk, Woman Talk and also Tororo, Tororo, Roro ‚Äì and the result, unpublished at the time of his death in 2002, have now been published under the title The Epilogue. were probably meant as an epilogue to both Rotimi's theatrical and comic careers, which span the entire spectrum of his career. It is comical and the language used is a version of \\"Nigerian English\\" (for example: \\"Se you get?\\" \\"I called God on him\\"). The works are also a social satire and this publication will spur renewed interest in his satires. Rotimi is sure to be remembered as a model in the literary genre whose views have shaped the conduct of the theatre and whose plays have demonstrated the power of drama to shape the thinking of the society and attempted to solve some of the problems encountered in everyday living.  Plays  * (1963) To Stir the God of Iron * (1966) Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again‚Äîdepicts the cocoa farmer and businessman Lejoka-Brown as a self-seeking, opportunistic leader who could make better contributions to his country outside of the political arena. * (1968) The Gods Are Not To Blame‚Äîan adaptation of the Greek classic Oedipus Rex; the main character gets trapped by pride, ignorance and the caprices of the divinities. * (1969) Kurunmi * (1970) Holding Talks * (1971) Ovonramven Nogbaisi‚Äîthe title character simply luxuriates in the grandeur of his office.

He makes use of wry humour to seek a level playing ground for resolution of the biases men and women nurse about one another and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There is a great deal of wit in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic. *Tororo, Tororo, Roro Tororo, Tororo, Roro is a coincidental meeting of two fellows from Man Talk, Woman Talk, Tunji Oginni and Philomena James. Both run Hotel Kilimanjaro with different motives and a chance meeting between them elicits lessons as both share each other's problems. = Performances = First performed in Nigeria in 1968, The Gods Are Not To Blame was produced at the Arcola Theatre in Hackney, London, in 2005. Femi Elufowoju Jr had his first theatre experience in 1975, at the age of 11, when he saw a revival of this very play, performed in a reconstructed Greek amphitheatre at a university campus in Ife; and brought it to the UK shores as a British leading theatre director under the company name Tiata FahodziCharlotte Cripps, \\"Authentic rhythms of Africa\\", The Independent, May 2005. His last production was a staging of Man Talk, Woman Talk at the French Institute in Lagos, Nigeria. He also produced Tororo Tororo roro, a play of the Absurd, as a convocation play. = Textual sources =  Style  For Man Talk, Woman Talk, directorial approach must have fluidity which will allow for creativity of the actors. The technicalities of the stage should be carefully applied in such a way that they will kill expected boredom associated with court scenes for if not done, the whole dramatic in the act will be flattened out.

There he pitched on the baseball team as a scholarship athlete, making the ACC academic honor roll three times. He was drafted as a pitcher by the Cincinnati Reds but never reported due to an injury. Career Schwartz joined Bear Stearns in 1976 first working in Dallas and then in 1979, he was appointed the director of research and investment in New York City. In 1985, he became executive vice president and head of Bear Stearns' Investment Banking Division.Duke Magazine: \\"Board Nominates Alumni Trustees\\" January 31, 2005 He became Co-President and Co-COO on June 25, 2001. Schwartz became sole President and COO in August 2007 after Warren Spector (the original heir-apparent to Chairman and CEO Jimmy Cayne) was forced to resign in the wake of the collapse of two hedge funds, which foreshadowed the upcoming subprime mortgage crisis and financial meltdown. Schwartz became CEO in January 2008. When Schwartz became CEO, Bear Stearns stock traded around $75 per share, however the share price continued to drop as the financial crisis worsened over 2007-08. Within a week of its near collapse and merger with JPMorgan Chase on March 16, 2008, the shares were trading at $5.33 per share. After the deal with JPMorgan was announced, the fire sale price of the stock prompted a reportedly angry confrontation between Schwartz and senior trader Alan Mintz in the company gym. Schwartz stayed on with JPMorgan for a short while to manage the transition but declined a permanent senior position with the firm. Schwartz also turned down offers from rival investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. In June 2009, Schwartz became executive chairman of Guggenheim Partners, an investment banking firm based in Chicago and New York. According to Schwartz, the new job meant \\"fate has dealt [him] an opportunity to start from scratch.\\" Schwartz is also the chairman of the Board of Visitors at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke and is a trustee on the Duke University Board of Trustees. In 1994, Schwartz was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. In 2006, he was a founding board member of the Robin Hood Foundation.

The lighthouse was completed in 1878, replacing the Cape Florida Light. It was automated on May 7, 1975 and is still in operation today. The structure is cast iron, with a screw-pile foundation, a platform and a skeletal tower. The light is 110 feet above the water. The tower framework is painted brown, while the dwelling and enclosed circular stair to the lantern is painted white. The original lens was a first-order drum Fresnel lens which stood about high and weighed about a ton (tonne). The light has a nominal range of 15 miles in the white sectors, and 10 miles in the red sectors. Fowey Rocks Lighthouse, U.S. Coast Guard Archive Fowey Rocks are named for the Royal Navy frigate HMS Fowey which was wrecked on a different reef to the south in 1748. During construction of the lighthouse the workers lived on a platform built over the water to minimize the danger of transporting them and their supplies each day from the mainland. While construction was under way, on 17 February 1878 the Arratoon Apcar ran aground on the reef. The 1500 ton steamship came to rest just from the workmen's platform. Efforts to save the boat failed, and she was pounded apart on the rocks and sank. Today the wreck is an excellent scuba diving site. One early assistant keeper of the lighthouse, Jefferson B. Browne, later became Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court.Love Dean, Lighthouses of the Florida Keys (1998), p. 228. The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 washed away the first deck of the lighthouse, 15 feet above the water, but the tower survived. The lighthouse is inside the boundaries of Biscayne National Park. In June 2011, the General Services Administration made the Fowey Rocks Light (along with 11 others) available at no cost to public organizations willing to preserve them. On October 2, 2012, the National Park Service accepted ownership of the light. It is the last of the original Florida Keys offshore manned reef lights in operation, all others having been decommissioned by 2015. The original Fresnel lens has been replaced by a modern solar-powered light. Although owned by the National Park Service, the light continues to be maintained by the US Coast Guard.

The battle was an integral part in the Red Cliffs campaign, as it was fought immediately after the major engagement at Wulin (ÁÉèÊûó; in present-day Honghu, Hubei) during the Battle of Red Cliffs. The Battle of Yiling was also the prelude to the subsequent Battle of Jiangling. Background Immediately after Cao Cao's defeat at Wulin in the Battle of Red Cliffs, Zhou Yu led 30,000 troops into Nan Commandery in a move to capture Jing Province's capital city, Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ; in present-day Jingjiang ËçÜÊ±ü, not to be confused with present-day Jiangling County, Hubei). Zhou Yu's army camped on the southern bank of the Yangtze River. Before engaging Cao Cao's general Cao Ren, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to take Yiling (Â§∑Èôµ; present-day Yichang, Hubei) as a preemptive move to secure the entrance to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing).(ÂÖµÊú™‰∫§ÈãíÔºåÁëúÂç≥ÈÅ£ÁîòÂØßÂâçÊìöÂ§∑Èôµ„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao. The battle =Defection of Xi Su= The commander of Yiling, Xi Su (), was originally an official under Liu Zhang and he hated Cao Cao. When Gan Ning's troops reached Yiling, Xi Su surrendered without a fight. As Gan Ning's force reached 1,000 (Gan had 700 men initially), Zhou Yu wanted to merge Xi Su and his 300 troops into L√º Meng's unit to strengthen the main force. L√º Meng refused the offer and appealed to Sun Quan not to reassign Xi Su and his 300 men, but rather, keep Xi Su with Gan Ning to reinforce defenses at Yiling. Sun Quan agreed to L√º Meng's proposal. When Cao Ren learnt that Yiling had fallen, he immediately sent 6,000 cavalry to retake the city. Under intense pressure, Gan Ning remained calm and stabilized his army's morale. =L√º Meng's strategies= As Gan Ning's request for reinforcements reached Zhou Yu, nearly \\"everyone pointed out that there were not enough men to spare as a relief force\\".(Êõπ‰ªÅÂàÜÁúæÂúçÂØßÔºåÂØßÂõ∞ÊÄ•Ôºå‰Ωø‰ΩøË´ãÊïë„ÄÇË´∏Â∞á‰ª•ÂÖµÂ∞ë‰∏çË∂≥ÂàÜ...)

Ling Tong took up the burden of facing Cao Ren and Xu Huang alone, in order to buy time for Zhou Yu, L√º Meng, and others to help Gan Ning at Yiling. Cao Ren did not expect Zhou Yu to ignore his massive army at Jiangling, and was consequently defeated at Yiling, suffering more than 3,000 casualties. Meanwhile, Ling Tong deceived Cao Ren into believing there was still a sizable army left in Zhou Yu's main camp, so Cao did not launch an all-out assault on Ling. Instead, Cao Ren sent Xu Huang to attack Ling Tong but failed. En route back to the main camp, L√º Meng suggested a plan to capture enemy warhorses: he would lead 300 soldiers to block the enemy's retreat route with bundles of firewood so the horses were unable to pass through. As L√º Meng expected, in order to escape from Zhou Yu's pursuit, Cao Ren's cavalry abandoned their steeds and fled back to Jiangling on foot.(ÊïµÂ§úÈÅÅÂéªÔºåË°åÈÅáÊü¥ÈÅìÔºåÈ®éÁöÜÊç®È¶¨Ê≠•Ëµ∞„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Zhou Yu returned with over 300 captured enemy warhorses and Yiling remained firmly in Sun Quan's control for the rest of the war.

Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n (1902‚Äì1968)Francisco Fern√°ndez de Mendiola, Isaac Puente: El m√©dico anarquista Txalaparta, 2007 . (p.124) was a Spanish anarchist, pacifist, doctor, and activist in the years leading up to and during the Spanish Civil War. Poch y Gasc√≥n was born in Zaragoza.Lola Campos, Mujeres aragonesas, Ibercaja, 2001 (p.167). She was one of the founding members of the Mujeres Libres and was appointed director of social assistance at the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance by Federica Montseny. She was responsible for organizing the Mujeres Libres in Barcelona and used her government position to promote the establishment of liberatorios de prostituci√≥n (liberation homes for prostitutes, where prostitutes could receive health care, psychotherapy and professional training to enable them to acquire economic independence through socially acceptable means). She worked to promote awareness about women's sexuality and advocated for sexual freedom and against monogamy and the sexual double standard. Unlike her co-founders in the Mujeres Libres, Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil and Mercedes Comaposada, she had been a member of the reformist treintista CNT before the war. She held a more essentialist view of women's nature, appealing to women as mothers and embracing motherhood as a natural, feminine state. She wrote extensively on the topic of motherhood, promoting an anarchist approach to child rearing. Dra. Amparo Poch is also a name well known in pacifist circles. Poch y Gasc√≥n was the co-leader of the Liga Espa√±ola de Refractarios a la Guerra, a group of absolutist war resisters,Peter Brock and Nigel Young, Pacifism in the Twentieth Century, Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 (p.96-97) along with her colleague, fellow pacifist Jos√© Brocca. During the Spanish Civil War she was active in Orden del Olivo (the order of the olive branch), the Spanish arm of War Resisters' International, helping to give aid to the war's victims. Poch y Gasc√≥n died in exile in Toulouse, 1968. A Spanish-language biography of Amparo Poch has been written by Antonina Rodrigo (see References below).  Background in Medicine  Poch got her degree in biology and medicine in 1929. She pursued further training after that, including enrolling in the Medical Association of Zaragoza. There, she promoted sanitation and prioritizing health on a national level. She focused primarily on mother/child aftercare from birth in an effort to reduce birth mortality rates in Zaragoza. She published Cartilla de Consejos a las Madres in December 1931, highlighting the appropriate lifestyle choices during pregnancy for healthy growth and lactation. In May 1934, she moved to Madrid, where she opened a medical clinic for women and children. This clinic was in the heart of Madrid, where it was most accessible for the general public. Because of the work of Poch and her team, Madrid's child mortality rates dropped in 1936, only one year after her implementation of the Puente de Vallecas Medical Clinic. After the success with the first clinic, it became the passion and goal of Poch to establish more accessible sanitation centers and medical clinics. This became more important once the Civil War started, because even though she was a pacifist, Poch was a vocal advocate for the anti-monarch resistance and even advocated for anarchism.Rodrigo, Antonina. ‚ÄúAmparo Poch y Gasc√≥n: La Doctora Libre.‚Äù El Peri√≥dico, 15 Apr. 2018, www.elperiodico.com/es/mas-periodico/20180414/amparo- poch-gascon-doctora-libre-6750793.  Writing  Poch has publications in many different mediums, including poetry, essays, novels, pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers. While they all serve a political purpose, Poch wrote beautifully and personally about the experience of being a Spanish woman in the heart of the Civil War. Her novel, Amor, tells the story of a painter and through it, discusses Poch's interest in anarchism and nonconformity. Her perseverance in publishing controversial articles and poems during the Civil War was looked down upon by many who thought social issues should halt during a death-stricken society.Rodrigo, Antonina (2002). Diputaci√≥n de Zaragoza, ed. Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n. Textos de una m√©dica libertaria. Alcarav√°n Ediciones While she is most well known for her magazine Los Mujeres Libres, her vibrantly raw poetry works to inform the public on the necessity of gender equality. Examples of such poetry are below. Translated through google. La maternidad no puede ser pretexto para cercenar derechos y aspiraciones a la mujer, pues pasada le √©poca m√°s dura de la gestaci√≥n queda en completa capacidad para unos y otras; decir que la mujer, por ser madre, no puede ser m√°s, es tan absurdo como si al hombre, por ser padre, se le estableciesen l√≠mites y restricciones en su intelectualidad y en sus privilegios. (...) La mujer quiere ser atendida, no tolerada; quiere ser igual, no inferior. Motherhood can not be a pretext for curtailing women's rights and aspirations, because after the hardest period of gestation, it remains in full capacity for both; to say that the woman, being a mother, can not be any more, it is as absurd as if the man, as a father, were established limits and restrictions on his intellectuality and privileges. (...) The woman wants to be treated, not tolerated; wants to be the same, not inferior. The Voice of Aragon. 11/28/1928 La realidad econ√≥mica enter√≥ a la mujer, completamente ignorante ya del ingenuo placer de la vida primitiva, de que la Casa la exclu√≠a de todas las tareas de producci√≥n, de todos los trabajos p√∫blicos que dan derecho a la subsistencia. Esta le ven√≠a por medio del hombre a quien rend√≠a sus servicios privados, incluso los sexuales; y se defendi√≥ en su nueva posici√≥n, preocup√°ndose de afianzar los lazos que la un√≠an al hombre. The economic reality informed the woman, completely ignorant of the naive pleasure of primitive life, that the House excluded her from all the tasks of production, from all the public works that give the right to subsistence. This came to him through the man to whom he rendered his private services, including sexual ones; and he defended himself in his new position, worrying about strengthening the ties that bound him to man. Free women. Number 3. July 1936.  Mujeres Libres  Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n was a founding member of the Mujeres Libres organization and magazine. Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women's organization that was active in Spain around the time of the Spanish Civil War. The Mujeres Libres rejected contemporary feminism, because they believed that it upheld a system of gender based privileges, albeit a different one than currently existed. The Mujeres Libres published a magazine of the same name, and were significantly engaged in consciousness raising efforts for working and peasant class women in Spain. The group emphasized and promoted the role of women in working toward social revolution that could work to combat sexism. The Mujeres Libres provided support for anti-fascist forces in the Spanish Civil War.‚ÄúMujeres Libres.‚Äù Razor Tie Artery Foundation, Rovi Corporation, June 1998, web.archive.org/web/20150926095452/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujer es_libres.html.  Civil War Medical Sanitation Changes  Using her medical degree and experience, she was able to effectively provide sanitation centers to help with health and medical concerns. She saw how dirty some infirmaries were for soldiers, and knew they deserved better. Even as a pacifist, the anti-fascist movement was too strong for her to not get involved. She even joined the ninth Battalion of the Angel Pasta√±a Regiment of the Partido Sindicalista in 1936. There were 1486 ‚Äúmilitiamen,‚Äù 83 of whom were women. Her natural need to heal others prevented her from lasting too long. She spent the remainder of the war as a militia doctor. On August 26, 1936, she became part of the Board of Orphan Protection of Defenders of the Republic, created by the Ministry of Public Instruction. With that recognition, along with the incomparable experience working on the sidelines of the Spanish Civil War, she was able to wield influence by teaching. In Barcelona, Poch directed a training program to teach others about rescuing and treatment of soldiers. She instructed commanding staff of the resistance military on everything from asphyxia, traumatisms, hemorrhages and even blood transfusions.Rodrigo, Antonina. ‚ÄúAmparo Poch y Gasc√≥n: La Doctora Libre.‚Äù El Peri√≥dico, 15 Apr. 2018, www.elperiodico.com/es/mas-periodico/20180414/amparo-poch-gascon- doctora-libre-6750793.  Exile in France  Poch was forced to go into exile in France in 1939 following the fascist victory in the Civil War. Poch would spend the rest of her life as a refugee in France, mostly working small side jobs to make ends meet. She continued her support of anti-fascist forces throughout World War II, and eventually returned to practicing medicine while in France. Poch was never able to return to Spain due to the regime of Francisco Franco, and she died in 1968 in Toulouse, France. ‚ÄúMujeres Libres.‚Äù Razor Tie Artery Foundation, Rovi Corporation, June 1998, web.archive.org/web/20150926095452/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujer es_libres.html.

In probability, a (discrete-time) Markov chain (DTMC) is a sequence of random variables, known as a stochastic process, in which the value of the next variable depends only on the value of the current variable, and not any variables in the past. For instance, a machine may have two states, A and E. When it is in state A, there is a 40% chance of it moving to state E and a 60% chance of it remaining in state A. When it is in state E, there is a 70% chance of it moving to A and a 30% chance of it staying in E. The sequence of states of the machine is a Markov chain. If we denote the chain by X_0, X_1, X_2, ... then X_0 is the state which the machine starts in and X_{10} is the random variable describing its state after 10 transitions. The process continues forever, indexed by the natural numbers. An example of a stochastic process which is not a Markov chain is the model of a machine which has states A and E and moves to A from either state with 50% chance if it has ever visited A before, and 20% chance if it has never visited A before (leaving a 50% or 80% chance that the machine moves to E). This is because the behavior of the machine depends on the whole history‚Äîif the machine is in E, it may have a 50% or 20% chance of moving to A, depending on its past values. Hence, it does not have the Markov property. A Markov chain can be described by a stochastic matrix, which lists the probabilities of moving to each state from any individual state. From this matrix, the probability of being in a particular state n steps in the future can be calculated. A Markov chain's state space can be partitioned into communicating classes that describe which states are reachable from each other (in one transition or in many). Each state can be described as transient or recurrent, depending on the probability of the chain ever returning to that state. Markov chains can have properties including periodicity, reversibility and stationarity. A continuous-time Markov chain is like a discrete-time Markov chain, but it moves states continuously through time rather than as discrete time steps. Other stochastic processes can satisfy the Markov property, the property that past behavior does not affect the process, only the present state. Definition A discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables X_0, X_1, X_2, ... with the Markov property, namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states: :\\\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\\\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \\\\ldots, X_n=x_n) = \\\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\\\mid X_n=x_n), if both conditional probabilities are well defined, that is, if \\\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\\\ldots,X_n=x_n)>0. The possible values of Xi form a countable set S called the state space of the chain. Markov chains are often described by a sequence of directed graphs, where the edges of graph n are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time n to the other states at time n + 1, \\\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\\\mid X_n=x_n). The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time n to time n + 1\\\\. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of n and are thus not presented as sequences. These descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution \\\\Pr(X_1=x_1). When time-homogeneous, the chain can be interpreted as a state machine assigning a probability of hopping from each vertex or state to an adjacent one. The probability \\\\Pr(X_n=x\\\\mid X_1=x_1) of the machine's state can be analyzed as the statistical behavior of the machine with an element x_1 of the state space as input, or as the behavior of the machine with the initial distribution \\\\Pr(X_1=y)=[x_1=y] of states as input, where [P] is the Iverson bracket. = Variations = *Time-homogeneous Markov chains (or stationary Markov chains) are processes where ::\\\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\\\mid X_n=y) = \\\\Pr(X_n=x\\\\mid X_{n-1}=y) :for all n. The probability of the transition is independent of n. *A Markov chain with memory (or a Markov chain of order m) :where m is finite, is a process satisfying :: \\\\begin{align} {} &\\\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\\\dots , X_1=x_1)  = &\\\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\\\dots, X_{n-m}=x_{n-m}) \\\\text{ for }n > m \\\\end{align} :In other words, the future state depends on the past m states. It is possible to construct a chain (Y_n) from (X_n) which has the 'classical' Markov property by taking as state space the ordered m-tuples of X values, ie. Y_n= \\\\left( X_n,X_{n-1},\\\\ldots,X_{n-m+1} \\\\right). n-step transitions The probability of going from state i to state j in n time steps is :p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\\\Pr(X_n=j\\\\mid X_0=i) and the single-step transition is :p_{ij} = \\\\Pr(X_1=j\\\\mid X_0=i). For a time-homogeneous Markov chain: :p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\\\Pr(X_{k+n}=j \\\\mid X_{k}=i) and :p_{ij} = \\\\Pr(X_{k+1}=j \\\\mid X_k=i). The n-step transition probabilities satisfy the Chapman‚ÄìKolmogorov equation, that for any k such that 0 < k < n, :p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\\\sum_{r \\\\in S} p_{ir}^{(k)} p_{rj}^{(n-k)} where S is the state space of the Markov chain. The marginal distribution Pr(Xn = x) is the distribution over states at time n. The initial distribution is Pr(X0 = x). The evolution of the process through one time step is described by : \\\\Pr(X_n=j) = \\\\sum_{r \\\\in S} p_{rj} \\\\Pr(X_{n-1}=r) = \\\\sum_{r \\\\in S} p_{rj}^{(n)} \\\\Pr(X_0=r). (The superscript (n) is an index, and not an exponent). Communicating classes and properties A state j is said to be accessible from a state i (written i ‚Üí j) if a system started in state i has a non-zero probability of transitioning into state j at some point. Formally, state j is accessible from state i if there exists an integer nij ‚â• 0 such that : \\\\Pr(X_{n_{ij}}=j \\\\mid X_0=i) = p_{ij}^{(n_{ij})} > 0. A state i is said to communicate with state j (written i ‚Üî j) if both i ‚Üí j and j ‚Üí i. A communicating class is a maximal set of states C such that every pair of states in C communicates with each other. Communication is an equivalence relation, and communicating classes are the equivalence classes of this relation. A communicating class is closed if the probability of leaving the class is zero, namely if i is in C but j is not, then j is not accessible from i. The set of communicating classes forms a directed, acyclic graph by inheriting the arrows from the original state space. A communicating class is closed if and only if it has no outgoing arrows in this graph. A state i is said to be essential or final if for all j such that i ‚Üí j it is also true that j ‚Üí i. A state i is inessential if it is not essential. A state is final if and only if its communicating class is closed. A Markov chain is said to be irreducible if its state space is a single communicating class; in other words, if it is possible to get to any state from any state. =Periodicity= A state i has period k if any return to state i must occur in multiples of k time steps. Formally, the period of state i is defined as : k = \\\\gcd\\\\\\\\{ n > 0: \\\\Pr(X_n = i \\\\mid X_0 = i) > 0\\\\\\\\} (where \\\\gcd is the greatest common divisor) provided that this set is not empty. Otherwise the period is not defined. Note that even though a state has period k, it may not be possible to reach the state in k steps. For example, suppose it is possible to return to the state in \\\\\\\\{6,~8,~10,~12,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\} time steps; k would be 2, even though 2 does not appear in this list. If k = 1, then the state is said to be aperiodic. Otherwise ( k > 1), the state is said to be periodic with period k. Periodicity is a class property‚Äîthat is, if a state has period k then every state in its communicating class has period k. =Transience and recurrence= A state i is said to be transient if, given that we start in state i, there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to i. Formally, let the random variable Ti be the first return time to state i (the \\"hitting time\\"): : T_i = \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ n\\\\ge1: X_n = i\\\\\\\\}. The number : f_{ii}^{(n)} = \\\\Pr(T_i = n \\\\mid X_0 = i) is the probability that we return to state i for the first time after n steps. Therefore, state i is transient if : \\\\Pr(T_i < \\\\infty \\\\mid X_0 = i) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_{ii}^{(n)} < 1\\\\. State i is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not transient. Recurrence and transience are class properties, that is, they either hold or do not hold equally for all members of a communicating class. A state i is recurrent if and only if the expected number of visits to i is infinite: :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty p_{ii}^{(n)} = \\\\infty. Positive recurrence Even if the hitting time is finite with probability 1, it need not have a finite expectation. The mean recurrence time at state i is the expected return time Mi: : M_i = E[T_i]=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty n\\\\cdot f_{ii}^{(n)}. State i is positive recurrent (or non-null persistent) if Mi is finite; otherwise, state i is null recurrent (or null persistent). Positive and null recurrence are classes properties. Absorbing states A state i is called absorbing if it is impossible to leave this state. Therefore, the state i is absorbing if and only if : p_{ii} = 1\\\\text{ and }p_{ij} = 0\\\\text{ for }i ot= j. If every state can reach an absorbing state, then the Markov chain is an absorbing Markov chain. =Reversible Markov chain= A Markov chain is said to be reversible if there is a probability distribution ' over its states such that :\\\\pi_i \\\\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\\\mid X_{n} = i) = \\\\pi_j \\\\Pr(X_{n+1} = i \\\\mid X_{n} = j) for all times n and all states i and j. This condition is known as the detailed balance condition (or local balance equation). Considering a fixed arbitrary time n and using the shorthand :p_{ij} = \\\\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\\\mid X_n = i)\\\\,, the detailed balance equation can be written more compactly as :\\\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\\\pi_j p_{ji}\\\\,. The single time-step from n to n + 1 can be thought of as each person i having i dollars initially and paying each person j a fraction pij of it. The detailed balance condition states that upon each payment, the other person pays exactly the same amount of money back. Clearly the total amount of money ' each person has remains the same after the time-step, since every dollar spent is balanced by a corresponding dollar received. This can be shown more formally by the equality :\\\\sum_i \\\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\\\sum_i \\\\pi_j p_{ji} = \\\\pi_j \\\\sum_i p_{ji} = \\\\pi_j\\\\,, which essentially states that the total amount of money person j receives (including from himself) during the time-step equals the amount of money he pays others, which equals all the money he initially had because it was assumed that all money is spent (that is, pji sums to 1 over i). The assumption is a technical one, because the money not really used is simply thought of as being paid from person j to himself (that is, pjj is not necessarily zero). As n was arbitrary, this reasoning holds for any n, and therefore for reversible Markov chains ' is always a steady-state distribution of Pr(Xn+1 = j  Xn = i) for every n. If the Markov chain begins in the steady-state distribution, that is, if Pr(X_0=i)=\\\\pi_i, then Pr(X_n=i)=\\\\pi_i for all n and the detailed balance equation can be written as :\\\\Pr(X_{n} = i, X_{n+1} = j) = \\\\Pr(X_{n+1} = i, X_{n} = j)\\\\,. The left- and right-hand sides of this last equation are identical except for a reversing of the time indices n and n + 1\\\\. Kolmogorov's criterion gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible directly from the transition matrix probabilities. The criterion requires that the products of probabilities around every closed loop are the same in both directions around the loop. Reversible Markov chains are common in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches because the detailed balance equation for a desired distribution ' necessarily implies that the Markov chain has been constructed so that ' is a steady-state distribution. Even with time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, where multiple transition matrices are used, if each such transition matrix exhibits detailed balance with the desired ' distribution, this necessarily implies that ' is a steady-state distribution of the Markov chain. Stationary distributions A distribution \\\\pi is a stationary distribution of the Markov chain with stochastic matrix P if and only if \\\\pi P = \\\\pi. This can be written as: :\\\\forall j\\\\in \\\\mathbb{S}: \\\\sum_{i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{S}} \\\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\\\pi_j This condition implies that \\\\pi P^n=\\\\pi and hence if the Markov chain (X_n, n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}) has initial distribution X_0 = \\\\pi then X_n = \\\\pi (in distribution) for any n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}. If a Markov chain is irreducible then it has a stationary distribution if and only if it is positive recurrent, in which case the unique such distribution is given by \\\\pi_i=\\\\frac{1}{M_i} where M_i=\\\\mathbb{E}(T_i) is the mean recurrence time of i. If a chain has more than one closed communicating class, its stationary distributions will not be unique (consider any closed communicating class C_i in the chain; each one will have its own unique stationary distribution \\\\pi_i. Extending these distributions to the overall chain, setting all values to zero outside the communication class, yields that the set of invariant measures of the original chain is the set of all convex combinations of the \\\\pi_i's). However, if a state j is aperiodic, then \\\\lim olimits_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} p_{jj}^{(n)} = \\\\tfrac{C}{M_j} and for any other state i, let fij be the probability that the chain ever visits state j if it starts at i, \\\\lim olimits_{n \\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} p_{ij}^{(n)} = C \\\\tfrac{f_{ij}}{M_j}. If a state i is periodic with period k > 1 then the limit \\\\lim olimits_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} p_{ii}^{(n)} does not exist, although the limit \\\\lim olimits_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} p_{ii}^{(kn+r)} does exist for every integer r. =Steady-state analysis and the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain= A Markov chain need not necessarily be time-homogeneous to have an equilibrium distribution. If there is a probability distribution over states \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi} such that :\\\\pi_j = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in S} \\\\pi_i \\\\, \\\\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\\\mid X_n = i) for every state j and every time n then \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi} is an equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain. Such can occur in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in situations where a number of different transition matrices are used, because each is efficient for a particular kind of mixing, but each matrix respects a shared equilibrium distribution. Hitting times The hitting time is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition. =Expected hitting times= For a subset of states A ‚äÜ S, the vector kA of hitting times (where element k_i^A represents the expected value, starting in state i that the chain enters one of the states in the set A) is the minimal non-negative solution to :\\\\begin{align} k_i^A = 0 & \\\\text{ for } i \\\\in A -\\\\sum_{j \\\\in S} q_{ij} k_j^A = 1&\\\\text{ for } i otin A. \\\\end{align} Ergodic theorem An instance of ergodic theory, the ergodic theorem for states that for an irreducible aperiodic Markov chain, with any two states i and j, :p_{i,j}^{(n)}\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{M_j} as n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty Notes References * A.

Formerly named the Palm Beach County School of the Arts (also known as \\"School of the Arts\\" or \\"SOA\\"), the school was renamed in recognition of a 1997 donation of $1 million by Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr., a West Palm Beach philanthropist. DSOA is administrated by the School District of Palm Beach County, which also provides most of its funding. The school receives supplementary funds for its arts and academics from the School of the Arts Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Designation DSOA is designated by the School District of Palm Beach County as a \\"choice\\" school. The District's Choice programs, formerly known as magnet schools, were part of a plan by the District in the 1980s to desegregate the county's schools without forced busing that would meet Federal requirements to attract white students schools in predominantly African-American neighborhoods. In subsequent years, federal desegregation requirements eased.

Students must reside in Palm Beach County, and show proof of that residence when they enroll and re-enroll each year. The majority of students commute to the school from around the county by District buses, by Tri-Rail to the train station across the street on Tamarind Avenue, and by car. A few students live locally and walk or bike to the campus. =Majors= Students are selected to major in one core art area: Communication Arts, Dance, Digital Media, Music, Theatre, and Visual Arts. Music is sub-divided into programs in Concert Band/Jazz, Orchestra, Vocal and Piano.Dreyfoos School of the Arts Official Website Students are then said to 'major' in their art area, taking at least two art area classes per year in addition to other academic and other classes. They may switch majors while attending, if they audition again and are accepted in the art area. Although students cannot dual major, they are permitted to take elective courses in other art areas if their schedule permits. National Recognition Dreyfoos is considered one of the top public arts and academics schools in the country. It has a 100% Advanced Placement (AP) participation rate, and has more Advanced Placement offerings than any other school in the District.

The series contained the following two segments: *The New Fred and Barney Show (a revival of The Flintstones) ‚Äì one episode, 30 minutes *The Thing (based on the Marvel Comics superhero Thing) ‚Äì two episodes, 11 minutes each Despite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble and Thing were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments. The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and The Flintstones was possible because, at this time, Marvel Comics owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; The Flintstones was one of these. For the 1979‚Äì80 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of The New Shmoo episodes and broadcast under the new title Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track, one of their last productions to do so. The Thing The first segment, a very loose adaptation of Marvel Comics' character the Thing, consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton) who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together two magic rings and reciting the words \\"Thing Ring, do your thing!\\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff Brooklyn-accented voice was based on that of comedian Jimmy Durante. The stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by Marilyn Schreffler), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by John Erwin), and Betty's blond tomboy younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by principal Miss Twilly (voiced by Marilyn Schreffler). Only Kelly and her scientist father Professor Harkness (voiced by John Stephenson) know Benjy's secret identity. When not battling various mad scientists and getting involved in Scooby-Doo-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty practical jokes of leather-clad bully Spike Hanrahan (voiced by Art Metrano) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the Yancy Street Gang. Other members of the Fantastic Four did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics. Twenty-six 11-minute episodes of The Thing were produced; two shorts aired per show. The Thing episodes are owned by WarnerMedia, through Hanna-Barbera, but the character is owned by The Walt Disney Company due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009. =Other appearances= In FF #8, Ant-Man and Dragon Man give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied exoskeleton and become the bubble-helmeted Miss Thing, saying \\"Thing Rings, do your thing--\\".FF #8, writer: Matt Fraction, artist: Mike Allred =Episodes= { class=wikitable style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:20px\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:20px\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:135px\\" Original air date } The New Fred and Barney Show The \\"Fred and Barney\\" half of the show consisted of a second season of seven new 30-minute episodes of The New Fred and Barney Show combined with reruns of first-season episodes. =Episodes= { class=wikitable style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:20px\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:20px\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF681F\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FF681F; width:135px\\" Original air date } Voice cast =The New Fred and Barney Show= *Henry Corden as Fred Flintstone *Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma Flintstone, Pebbles Flintstone *Mel Blanc as Barney Rubble, Dino *Gay Autterson as Betty Rubble *Don Messick as Bamm-Bamm Rubble *John Stephenson as Mr. Slate =The Thing= *Wayne Morton as Benjy Grimm, Stretch *Joe Baker as The Thing *Noelle North as Kelly Harkness *Marilyn Schreffler as Betty Harkness, Miss Twilly *John Erwin as Ronald Radford *Art Metrano as Spike Hanrahan *Michael Sheehan as Turkey *John Stephenson as Professor Harkness References External links  Category:The Flintstones spin-offs Category:1979 American television series debuts Category:1979 American television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:1970s American animated television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American animated television spin-offs Category:Crossover animated television series Category:Fantastic Four television series Category:NBC original programming Category:Television shows based on Marvel Comics Category:Animated television series based on Marvel Comics Category:Television series by Hanna-Barbera Category:Television series set in prehistory ","title":"Fred and Barney Meet the Thing"},{"id":"3383644","text":"Richard Ervins (born December 7, 1968) is a former American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers.

His eight consecutive 100-yard performances were a USC record and this record has since been broken by former Trojans running back Reggie Bush. Professional career Ervins later played for the Washington Redskins as a rookie running back, he was a second on the team in rushing yards with 680 on the season (behind Earnest Byner) and helped the team win Super Bowl XXVI. In the Super Bowl, he was the game's leading rusher, with 72 yards on 13 carries as the Redskins beat the Buffalo Bills 37-24. Ervins received several honors during his rookie year with Washington, including the PFWA all-Rookie, Football Digest All-Rookie, Pro Football Weekly All-Rookie, Football News All-Rookie, College & Pro Football Newsweekly All- Rookie, Quarterback Club‚Äôs Rookie of the year, and Washington Redskin Rookie of the year. He stayed with the Redskins until 1994 when he moved to the San Francisco 49ers. He retired in 1995.

Early life Vrindavana Dasa was born in Mamgachi in the Navadvipa area of West Bengal. His mother was Narayani, the niece of Srinivasa Acarya, a direct follower of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Vrindavana Dasa‚Äôs father, Vaikunthanatha Vipra, was from Sylet in East Bengal. However, it is said that his father died before he was born and so his mother moved to the house of Srivasa in Mayapura. In his youth Vrindavana Dasa took initiation from Nityananda, one of the main associates of Chaitanya and he was apparently the last disciple that Nityananda accepted. Chaitanya Bhagavata In 1535, Vrindvana Dasa wrote the Chaitanya Bhagavata, a biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Initially, the Chaitanya Bhagavata was named Chaitanya Mangala. However the poet Lochana Dasa also wrote a work with this title. Therefore, the leading Vaishnavas in Vrindavana met and decided that henceforth Vrindavana Dasa's book would be known as the Chaitanya Bhagavata, and Lochana Dasa‚Äôs book would remain as the Chaitanya Mangala. Praise of Vrindavana Dasa Vrindavana Dasa is considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas as the Vyasa of Chaitanya‚Äôs pastimes, since he was the first to reveal that Chaitanya was God himself and not just an incarnation of Godhead. It would seem that the Chaitanya Bhagavata was the only major work written by Vrindavana Dasa. There are a number of other works attributed to him but their authorship has not been validated.

It started with the establishment of large car manufacturing plants and reorganisation of the AMO Factory in Moscow in the late 1920s‚Äìearly 1930s, during the first five-year plan, and continued until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. Before its dissolution, the Soviet Union produced 2.1-2.3 million units per year of all types, and was the sixth (previously fifth) largest automotive producer, ranking ninth place in cars, third in trucks, and first in buses. Soviet industry exported 300,000-400,000 cars annually, mainly to Soviet Union satellite countries, but also to Northern America, Central and Western Europe, and Latin America. There were substantial numbers of highway trucks (Volvo, MAN from capitalist countries; LIAZ, Csepel and IFA from socialist countries) in some quantities, construction trucks (Magirus-Deutz, Tatra), delivery trucks (Robur and Avia) and urban, intercity and tourist buses (Ikarus, Karosa) imported as well.  History  AMO-F-15 on a Soviet stamp NAMI-I =Early Soviet period= Motor vehicle production in the USSR, 1929-1950 Russia had no automotive industry prior to the Soviet era. Automobiles were manufactured, but only in small quantity and by importing the main components from abroad. After the 1917 October Revolution, Russo-Balt was nationalised on August 15, 1918, and renamed to Prombron by the new leadership. It continued the production of Russo-Balt cars and launched a new model on October 8, 1922, while AMO built FIAT 15 Ter trucks under licence and released a more modern FIAT-derived truck developed by a team of AMO designers, the AMO-F-15. About 6,000‚Äì6,500 F-15s were built in the years 1924‚Äì1931. A Citroen plant built before the war was allowed to operate as a private business until 1921, when it was nationalized. The first fully Soviet-made vehicles were manufactured by the AMO plant in Moscow on 7 November 1924. In 1927, engineers from the Scientific Automobile & Motor Institute (NAMI) created the first original Soviet car NAMI-I, which was produced in small numbers by the Spartak State Automobile Factory in Moscow, between 1927 and 1931.Kelly M. A. Russian Motor Vehicles: The Czarist Period 1784 to 1917. Veloce Publishing Ltd. 2009. p. 78-79 In the early decades after the Revolution, Gorky and Moscow became the main centers of motor vehicle manufacturing. As in Western countries, components for the industry were produced in a large number of different places. Stalinist pressure for rapid industrialization and appreciation for economies of scale brought about the construction in the late 1920s and early 1930s of massive factories manufacturing highly standard vehicle and slowly changing product lines. Construction of the Moscow (ZIL), Gor‚Äòkiy, and Yaroslavl' plants, partly or totally built by Western firms, increased production from a few thousand vehicles in 1928 to 200,000 vehicles in 1937, nearly all of them trucks. In 1929, due to a rapidly growing demand for automobiles and in cooperation with its trade partner, the Ford Motor Company, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy established GAZ. A year later, a second automobile plant was founded in Moscow, which would become a major Soviet car maker after World War II and earn nationwide fame under the name Moskvitch. However, due to specific government aims and economic hardships of that time, cars were only a small share of all vehicles produced in the early years of Soviet production. In 1937, the Soviet Union produced over 200,000 vehicles, mostly trucks, putting the country in second place worldwide by production of trucks. Between 1932 and 1939 the amount of car production in the Soviet Union increased up to 844,6%. =Postwar period= After the war, the Soviet automotive industry developed rapidly. The State Defense Committee issued a number of important decisions: it established new car factories in Kutaisi and Dnepropetrovsk and on August 26, 1945, issued Resolution No. 9905 \\"On the Restoration and Development of the Automotive Industry\\", which outlined the future development of car production in the USSR. In 1947, the total number of automobiles produced in the Soviet Union was 132,968, including 9622 cars, 121,248 trucks, 2098 buses, but still did not exceed the pre-war level. Two years later, in 1949, it surpassed the previous record and in 1950 the production was brought up to 363,000 vehicles per year. 1948 marked the beginning of Soviet export of cars. In 1950, cars from the Soviet Union were present at the international car exhibition in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, and soon thereafter were exported to Western Europe. By the late 1950s, the Soviet Union produced 43 car models, and in 1957 the overall number of automobiles produced was 495,994, which included 113,588 cars, 369,504 trucks, and 12,316 buses, and in the following year reached the level of 600,000 cars per year. =1960s and 1970s= Production of passenger cars in the USSR, 1960-1979 In the 1960s the Soviets sought to diversify and broaden the motor vehicle industry but continued to rely on massive vertically integrated facilities. Their 15-year transportation modernization plan announced in 1965 called for increasing production of automobiles and heavy trucks to boost consumer welfare and create a larger and more balanced truck fleet. At the beginning of the 1960s, when MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were offering a variety of cars and the popularity of having a personal automobile in the Soviet Union was on the rise, the Soviet government opted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a people's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport. For reasons of cost- efficiency, it was decided to sign a licence agreement with a foreign company and produce the car on the basis of an existing, modern model. Several options were considered, including Volkswagen, Ford, Peugeot, Renault and FIAT. The Fiat 124 was chosen because of its simple and sturdy design, being easy to manufacture and repair. The plant was built in just 4 years (1966‚Äì1970) in the small town of Stavropol Volzhsky, which later grew to a population of more than half a million and was renamed Togliatti to commemorate Palmiro Togliatti. At the same time, the Izhmash car plant was established in the city of Izhevsk as part of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, with the initiative coming from the Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov and in order to increase the overall production of cars in the Soviet Union. It produced Moskvitchs and Moskvitch-based kombi hatchbacks. By 1970, the manufacture of trucks and other commercial vehicles was decentralized and these were made not only in Moscow and Gorky but also in Belarus (Minsk, Zhodino), the Ukraine (Kremenchug), Georgia (Kutaisi), and in the Volga and Ural regions (Ulyanovsk and Miass). The manufacture of automobiles was confined exclusively to Moscow, Gorky, and Izhevsk (Ural region) until the late 1960s. From 1970 to 1979, automobile production grew by nearly 1 million units per year, and truck production grew by 250,000 per year. The production ratio of automobiles to trucks increased in that time from 0.7 to 1.7, indicating that more attention was being given to the consumer market. The Soviets reportedly allocated one-half of the estimated 7 billion rubles invested in the automotive industry during 1971-75 to the construction of the Volga car and Kama truck plants. As the 15-year plan was drawing to a close, the Soviets modified their traditional approach of simply building additional plants to raise output. Soviet officials publicly acknowledged the need for continued growth in vehicle production, but they stressed the need for greater productivity and new vehicle designs to improve performance, utility and operating efficiency. =1980s= By the early 1980s, Soviet automobile industry consisted of several main plants, which produced vehicles for various market segments. Prior to 1988, private buyers were also not allowed to buy commercial vehicles like minibuses, vans, trucks or buses for personal use. Domestic car production satisfied only 45% of the domestic demand; nevertheless, no import of cars was permitted. =Post-1991= After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, automakers of the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States were integrated into a market economy and immediately hit by a crisis due to the loss of financial support, economic turmoil, criminal activitiesIreland A.

P. 81 and stiffer competition in the domestic market during the 1990s. Some of them, like AvtoVAZ, turned to cooperation with other companies (such as GM-AvtoVAZ) in order to obtain substantial capital investment and overcome the crisis. Few others, like AZLK, became dormant, whereas ZAZ transformed itself into a new company, UkrAVTO. Private ownership There were queues for the purchase of cars and many domestic buyers often had to wait years for a new car. In the 1970s, passenger cars made by VAZ (Lada) and GAZ (Volga) were the most in demand. Volgas were the most prestigious vehicles sold to private buyers, although up to 60% of the production was reserved for state and party institutions. Always popular and available for sale were Moskvitch and Zaporozhets cars, as well as compact four-wheel-drive LuAZ vehicles. All- terrain cars made by UAZ were not available privately, but could be bought decommissioned. Limousine brands Chaika (GAZ factory) and ZIL were not available for the general public. List of manufacturers The bulk of the automotive industry of the Soviet Union, with annual production approaching 1.8 million units, was located in Russian SFSR. Ukrainian SSR was second, at more than 200,000 units per year, Byelorussian SSR was third at 40,000. Other Soviet republics (SSRs) did not have significant automotive industries. Only the first two republics produced all types of automobiles. With the exception of ZAZ and LuAZ, which were located in the Ukrainian SSR, all the aforementioned companies were located in the RSFSR. Besides the RSFSR, some truck plants were established in Ukrainian, Byelorussian, Georgian, Armenian, and Kyrghizian SSRs while buses were produced in the Ukrainian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Tajik republics. =Armenian SSR= *ErAZ (1964‚Äì2002) produced RAF-based panel vans and minibuses. =Azerbaijan SSR= *BakAZ (1978‚Äì1993) produced PAZ-based small buses *KiAZ (1986‚Äìpresent) =Byelorussian SSR= BelAZ-548A *BelAZ (1948‚Äìpresent) manufactured super-heavy trucks *MAZ (1944‚Äìpresent) manufactured heavy trucks *MoAZ (1948‚Äìpresent) *MZKT (1954‚Äìpresent) in Soviet times, was a division of MAZ, a manufacturer of heavy and super-heavy trucks *Neman (1984‚Äìpresent) from 1990 started limited production of LiAZ-based buses =Estonian SSR= *ToARZ *Estonia (race car) =Georgian SSR= *KAZ (1945‚Äìpresent, truck production ceased in the 1990s) produced backbone tractors with a comfortable cabin, but low quality and dynamic characteristics and had gained in the Soviet Union a bad reputation.

In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Court upheld the provision in the Criminal Code. Background Sue Rodriguez was a 42-year-old mother whose illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") was diagnosed in 1992. By 1993, it was found that she would not live more than a year, and so she began a crusade to strike down section 241(b) of the Criminal Code, which made assisted suicide illegal, to the extent it would be illegal for a terminally ill person to commit \\"physician-assisted\\" suicide. She applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to have section 241(b) of Criminal Code struck down because it allegedly violated sections 7 (the right to \\"life, liberty, and security of the person), 12 (protection against \\"cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\\") and 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (equality). Her ethics advisor was Eike-Henner Kluge. Reasons of the court Sopinka J, writing for the majority, found there was no violation of section 7. He first considered whether the prohibition on ending one's life engaged the right to security of person. He found the prohibition had sufficient connection with the justice system by its impact on an individual's autonomy and right to life by causing physical and psychological pain. However, Sopinka J found the provision did not violate any principles of fundamental justice. He examined the long history of the prohibition of suicide and concludes that it reflects part of the fundamental values of society and so could not be in violation of fundamental justice. He also rejected the claim that the provision violated the section 12 right against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as a mere prohibition did not fall within the meaning of treatment. Lastly, he considered the section 15 equality challenge. He noted the issue is best not resolved under this right, but in assuming it did violate section 15, he found it was clearly saved under section 1. He found the objective was pressing and substantial, rational and that there was no lesser means to achieve the goal. In dissent, Lamer CJ held that the Criminal Code section 241(b) had infringed on section 15, but he did not consider sections 7 and 12. Cory J ruled that the right to die is as much a protected freedom under section 7 of the Charter as any other part of life. McLachlin J's judgment was that Criminal Code section 241(b) violated the section 7 right to security of the person and that the violation was not saved under section 1. Overturned The Supreme Court's ruling in Rodriguez was overturned 22 years later in the 2015 decision in Carter v Canada (AG),2015 SCC 5. which found that denying assisted suicide in some cases violated Section 7 of the Charter.

The first incarnation of Novoe Slovo was originally run by moderate narodniks (populists). In April 1897 the magazine was taken over by Legal Marxists and edited by them until it was shut down by the Tsarist government in December 1897. It was followed by another Legal Marxist magazine, Nachalo, in January‚ÄìJune 1899.

Maxim Gorky, an increasingly popular realist writer who was close to Russian Marxists, was also published in the magazine. The title was used again in 1917 when the Russian Provisional Government suppressed Zhivoye Slovo (The Live Word) in August and the magazine reappeared first as Slovo (The Word) and then as Novoye Slovo.

She carries the rank of Distinguished Research Professor at York University, in Toronto, and is also an associate scientist at the Rotman Research Institute of the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 1976 with a specialization in cognitive and language development in children. Current research Much of Bialystok's current research concentrates on bilingualism from childhood through older adulthood and aging, and its effects on cognitive processes over the lifespan. She has also studied aspects of language acquisition in children, both in written and verbal forms, and how bilingualism might affect these processes. Bilingualism and cognitive development in children Bilingualism has been shown through various studies to have a significant effect on certain aspects of cognitive development, especially in comparison to that of monolingual individuals. Bialystok has investigated this idea further, attempting to figure out what parts of cognitive development, specifically, are affected by bilingualism. Children are of particular interest to this realm of research, as she studies the developmental progression of bilingual children as opposed to that of monolingual children. =Executive control= While bilingualism has repeatedly been shown to affect cognitive development, research has been less focused on which aspects of cognitive development, in particular, are affected. Bialystok and Barac, in a study about the generality of bilingual effects on development, compared three groups of bilinguals to one group of monolinguals in a series of linguistic tasks and one nonlinguistic, executive control task involving task-switching. The three bilingual groups differed according to three factors: similarity between languages spoken, cultural background, and language of educational experience. All three bilingual groups outperformed the monolingual group on the task-switching executive control task, however, even in excluding the monolingual group, neither of the three differentiating factors had a significant effect on the performance of the executive control task. These results suggest that bilingualism itself provides an advantage in the nonverbal, executive control aspect of cognitive development. Executive control is known to involve three main components including selective attention/inhibition, attention shifting, and working memory. In a separate study, Bialystok examined the difference in development and subsequent coordination of these three components of executive function in bilingual children as opposed to that of monolingual children. Two groups of children who were either monolingual or bilingual completed a complex classification task that required the use of either one or multiple components of executive control functions. This was done with the use of visual and/or auditory stimuli, where a single-modality version presented either the visual or auditory component, requiring the use of just one executive control component, and a dual-modality version that combined the two, and therefore required the use of multiple executive control components. The single-modality condition did not elicit significantly different performance by either the monolinguals or bilinguals, however, in the dual-modality condition that required the use of multiple components, bilinguals performed with much higher accuracy than the monolinguals. Beyond this general advantage to cognitive development seen in bilinguals, there is remarkable evidence for an advantage regarding executive control in particular ‚Äì specifically in cases where multiple components of this executive control is required for perform a task. This has implications for real-world situations, as multitasking is a common everyday function that bilinguals could possibly perform better at than monolinguals. Regarding the reason behind this advantage, no definitive evidence has been collected. However, it is thought that because bilinguals must constantly shift between two languages, selecting the correct words from one while ignoring competing information from the other, that they have more practice in simultaneously using multiple components of executive functioning. Because bilinguals go through this process on a daily basis throughout their lifespan, they therefore gain an advantage over monolingual individuals who do not recruit this same simultaneous function as often. =Language immersion and bilingualism= Children generally acquire language naturally both through their environment and their parents, as well as others within their community. This generally happens with one language that becomes the child's native language, but also can happen with a second language in the case of a bilingual child. Though most bilingual children are brought up with this second language from very early on in life, some bilinguals learn a second language later on, or through different, less conventional means. Bialystok, Hermanto, and Moreno examined a group of children in grades 2 and 5 who were placed in an intensive French immersion program within the context of an English-speaking community. The children's schooling was conducted solely in French, creating an educational environment with a completely separate language from their home environment in which only English (or another native language) was spoken. Children's progress in their development of both English and French linguistic and metalinguistic skills were examined to assess how accurately their developing abilities matched those of fully bilingual children (those who had learned their second language at home), and whether or not the intensive French immersion was impeding their English language development. While the analysis of tasks concerning linguistic and metalinguistic abilities in both French and English found a variety of different patterns, many of those patterns matched that of the fully bilingual children. Thus, these children participating in this immersion program are not only able to truly become bilingual, but gain the advantages that come with bilingualism as well. Continued exposure to French as well as instruction in the formal structures of the language should only improve upon these children's developing linguistic skills. =Phonological awareness and early reading= Phonological awareness is a necessary prerequisite in learning to read in any language. However, when it comes to children who are learning to read two different languages, particularly those with different writing systems, these processes by which the child ultimately learns to read must differ in some way in comparison to children learning just one language's writing system on its own. Bialystok and Luk studied English-Cantonese bilingual children to investigate the relationship between phonological awareness and early reading in children learning languages with different writing systems. Children participated in two testing sessions, one in English and one in Cantonese. Testing sessions included assessments of working memory and cognitive ability, in addition to phonological awareness and word identification tasks to determine whether phonological awareness and word identification (early reading) use similar or different types of processes. Results demonstrated two different types of processing. Phonological awareness, which was strongly correlated across the two languages, suggests a common cognitive basis regardless of the language being learned. Word identification, in contrast, did not relate across the two languages, suggesting a specific ability governed by each individual language and its particular demands. In the case of bilingual children learning to read two different writing systems, phonological awareness appears to be a more generalized ability that can be transferred easily across languages, while word identification (and therefore reading) must be developed separately for each language. Bilingualism throughout the lifespan  The advantages of bilingualism as it relates to children has been tested and replicated throughout numerous studies. Pushing this notion further comes the possibility that bilingualism might remain throughout adulthood and aging in general. The question then becomes how aging throughout a lifetime affects the cognitive advantage, and in what ways. =Cognitive advantages in adults = Considering the bilingual advantage previously discussed as seen in adult bilinguals, interest arises regarding the physical brain structures and neural processes that regulate certain aspects of executive control, such as inhibition. Bialystok, Luk, Craik, Grady, and Anderson used fMRI technology to examine the active brain regions of both monolingual and bilingual young adults during tasks representing either interference suppression, by manually pressing a correct response key, or response inhibition, where participants had to intentionally inhibit a specific eye movement. In the response inhibition condition, both the monolinguals and bilinguals activated the same neural network and performed the task in the same amount of time. However, in the interference suppression trials, bilinguals activated different neural regions than monolinguals and also performed the task more quickly. The distinction in neural response between monolinguals and bilinguals indicates not only that interference suppression and response inhibition are cognitively distinct from one another, but also supports the idea that bilingualism provides an advantage in the cognitive control of inhibition concerning conscious attention (manual key pressing), but doesn't not seem to have a significant effect regarding the control of more instantaneous motor responses (inhibition of eye movements). =Advantages and other effects of aging= It appears that the bilingual advantage seen in children may persist, and even strengthen, throughout adulthood. A possible explanation for this continual advantage suggests that the constant management of two equally prominent languages competing for attention recruits the use of executive functions more often, and that this ability continually enhances functions of executive control. Furthermore, this advantage may extend further and possibly help to slow the natural declination of cognitive control brought about by the aging process. Bialystok, Craik, and Luk tested both younger and older monolingual and bilingual adults on a variety of tasks assessing working memory, lexical retrieval, and executive control to further investigate the specific ways in which bilingualism affects cognition, and how aging can modify these effects. The effect of the language group differed according to each task, where both monolinguals and bilinguals performed about similarly on working memory tasks, monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on lexical retrieval tasks, and bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on executive control tasks. Further analysis showed that bilinguals did, in fact, have inferior language knowledge as compared to monolinguals, yet similar working memory abilities. However, bilinguals did show overall superior executive control functions to their monolingual counterparts. In addition, the greatest levels of executive control were achieved by the older bilingual group, in accordance with the prediction that bilingualism throughout the lifespan attenuates the age- related deterioration of executive control tasks ‚Äì those tasks that were nonverbal in nature, as bilinguals tend to do worse than monolinguals on linguistic measures. Further work was done with groups of younger and older monolingual and bilingual adults in three consecutive studies investigating the persistence of the bilingual advantage into adulthood, as well as the notion that bilingualism provides a defense against the deterioration that aging brings on executive control. Bialystok, Craik, Klein, and Viswanathan found that results indicated a continuation of the bilingual advantage into adulthood, and a pattern that suggests a slowing of age-related decline in executive processes for older bilingual adults along with other positive effects in cognitive functioning, suggesting widespread benefits of bilingualism beyond what was originally hypothesized. Bilingualism and the onset of dementia  The natural process of aging has a deteriorating effect on the brain, and commonly leads to detrimental conditions such as dementia or more specifically, Alzheimer's disease. With the bilingual advantage that appears to persist throughout a person's lifespan, it is plausible that symptoms of these conditions could be offset or further delayed by the lifelong advantages brought about by bilingualism. = White matter and brain reserve= As people grow older, it has been shown that white matter integrity in the brain generally decreases as the natural process of aging takes its course, resulting in a decline of cognitive functioning and control. Because previous work has demonstrated a greater cognitive ability in older bilingual adults, however, it is thought that lifelong bilingualism may mitigate this cognitive decline, resulting in a higher level of white matter integrity and connectivity in these individuals, and therefore greater cognitive ability over that of their monolingual counterparts. Bialystok, Luk, Craik, and Grady, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), measured the amount of white matter integrity in both monolingual and bilingual older adults. The results were consistent with the prediction and demonstrate a strong correlation between lifelong bilingualism and preserved white matter integrity, which might ultimately contribute to the higher level of brain reserve found in these bilingual individuals. A possible explanation holds that continued experience in the maintenance and management of two competing languages enhances and strengthens certain structural pathways in the brain, resulting in a widespread network of white matter connectivity, which then helps protect against natural cognitive decline. =Cognitive reserve and Alzheimer's disease= Like the protection bilingualism appears to provide against general cognitive deterioration, it has been hypothesized that bilingualism may also slow the onset of symptoms specifically brought about by Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is thought that bilingualism might be a factor contributing to cognitive reserve, which in turn, may help delay the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Bialystok, Craik, Fischer, Ware, and Schweizer analyzed and measured brain atrophy in both monolingual and bilingual patients diagnosed with AD using computed tomography (CT) scans with the logic that bilingual patients, when matched with monolingual patients on level of disease severity, should exhibit more atrophy in areas typically used to discriminate between AD patients and healthy ones, as their enhanced cognitive reserve brought about by bilingualism would allow a higher level of functioning than would usually be associated with that level of disease. Results supported this notion and found that the bilingual patients with AD did, in fact, show a greater level of brain atrophy in relevant areas. Even with this increased level of atrophy, however, the bilingual group still performed at the same cognitive level as their monolingual counterparts. These results support the hypothesis maintaining that bilingualism works as a contributor to cognitive reserve and acts as a modifier to behavioral expression that underlies brain atrophy associated with Alzheimer's disease. Further research supports the above hypothesis, and extends it claiming that bilingualism can postpone the onset of the symptoms of AD by as much as 4‚Äì5 years. Bialystok, Craik, and Freedman collected data from bilingual and monolingual patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease regarding, most importantly, age of onset of cognitive impairment and language history and abilities. A 4.3 year delay in diagnosis and a 5.1 year delay in the reported onset of symptoms was found for the bilinguals in comparison to the monolinguals. Not only do these data support the notion of bilingualism contributing to cognitive reserve, thereby compensating for higher levels of brain atrophy, but also that bilingualism might even postpone the onset of AD symptoms by a dramatic 4‚Äì5 years.

Life Zhou Fang was from Yangxian County (), Wu Commandery, which is around present-day Yixing, Jiangsu. He was known for being well-read and studious in his youth. When he reached the age of adulthood, he was nominated as a xiaolian (civil service candidate) to serve in the local commandery office. Around the time, one Peng Shi () had rallied several supporters in Qiantang County () and formed a bandit gang to terrorise the locals. Sun Quan, the warlord who ruled the territories in Jiangdong at the time, appointed Zhou Fang as the Chancellor (Áõ∏; i.e. chief administrative officer) of Qiantang County to deal with Peng Shi. Within 10 days, Zhou Fang eliminated Peng Shi and the bandits, and was promoted to serve as the Commandant of the West District () in Danyang Commandery (). In the middle of the Huangwu era (222‚Äì229) of Sun Quan's reign as the King of Eastern Wu, one Peng Qi () started a rebellion in Poyang Commandery (). Sun Quan appointed Zhou Fang as the Administrator () of Poyang Commandery and tasked him and Hu Zong () with putting down the rebellion. Zhou Fang and Hu Zong succeeded in their mission and captured Peng Qi alive and sent him as a captive to Sun Quan. For his efforts in quelling the revolt, Zhou Fang was promoted to Colonel of Illustrious Righteousness (). In 228, Zhou Fang became the central figure in the Battle of Shiting between Eastern Wu and its rival state Cao Wei. He pretended to surrender and defect to Cao Xiu, the Wei commander, who fell for his ruse and led some 100,000 troops to attack Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Along the way, Wu forces led by Lu Xun and Zhou Fang ambushed Cao Xiu and his army and dealt them a crushing defeat with several thousands of casualties. In recognition of Zhou Fang's contributions in the battle, Sun Quan promoted him to Major- General () and awarded him the title of a Secondary Marquis (). When bandit forces led by Dong Si () raided Yuzhang () and Linchuan () commanderies, the Wu officers Wu Can and Tang Zi led 3,000 troops to attack them but could not breach their base. Zhou Fang came up with a plan by sending a spy to assassinate Dong Si, after which Dong Si's brother led the other bandits to willingly surrender to Wu forces. Zhou Fang served as the Administrator of Poyang Commandery for about 13 years until his death (in an unknown year). During his tenure, he governed fairly and justly. His son, Zhou Chu, became a famous general during the Jin dynasty. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Description The Rambler was published on Tuesdays and Saturdays from 1750 to 1752 and totals 208 articles.; ; ; ; ; It was Johnson's most consistent and sustained work in the English language. Though similar in name to preceding publications such as The Spectator and The Tatler, Johnson made his periodical unique by using a style of prose which differed from that of the time period. The most popular publications of the day were written in the common or colloquial language of the people whereas The Rambler was written in elevated prose. As was then common for the type of publication, the subject matter was confined only to the imagination of the author (and the sale of the publication); typically, however, The Rambler discussed subjects such as morality, literature, society, politics, and religion. Johnson included quotes and ideas in his publication from Renaissance humanists such as Desiderius Erasmus and Ren√© Descartes. His writings in The Rambler are considered to be neoclassical. Purpose The Rambler was written primarily for the newfound, rising middle-class of the 18th century, who sought social fluency within aristocratic social circles. It was especially targeted to the middle-class audience that were increasingly marrying into aristocratic families in order to create socio-economic alliances, but did not possess the social and intellectual tools to integrate into those higher social circles which required great understanding of subjects, as listed above in the Description. Copies of The Rambler were written in essay form and were made cheaply available to the middle-class. In his fourth section of The Rambler (31 March 1750), Johnson points out that he would like to \\"Join both profit and delight in one\\" in the prelude; that is, provide intellectual profit and literary delight to those who read his work. This desire to \\"join both profit and delight\\" streams throughout the publications, and is particularly resonant of Classical literary design. The majority of the subject matter in The Rambler focused more on moral than social issues. In this sense, Johnson's writings were didactic, although he maintains an explorative attitude rather than a strictly instructive voice. Comparison with The Spectator As its author lamented in its final essay, \\"I have never been much a favourite to the publick,\\" the publication was not an immediate success. Perhaps this was due to Johnson's departure from The Spectator, which could be considered his precedent. The latter was a periodical published from 1711 to 1712 by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, popular for its light treatment of elevated subjects by \\"enliven[ing] morality with wit.\\" In tone and subject matter, The Rambler was both lengthier and more serious than its popular ancestor in the genre. It also had a strong element of didacticism. The Rambler contained more sermon-like reflective essays and lacked the Spectator's \\"dramatic\\" qualities. There were many however who religiously read and appreciated the publication. One contemporary author thought so highly of The Rambler to say, \\"May the publick favours crown his merits, and may not the English, under the auspicious reign of George the Second, neglect a man, who, had he lived in the first century, would have been one of the greatest favourites of Augustus.\\" The Rambler was widely respected for the quality and power of the writing and the masterful use of language and rhetoric. Revival In 1901, Herbert Vivian produced a magazine called \\"The Rambler\\" that he intended as a revival of Johnson's periodical. The revived magazine only lasted until 1902.

The film is about two young brothers who run away from home due to emotional conflict over the divorce of their parents. It was directed by Billy Weber and produced by Martin Brest. Plot 12-year-old Josh Whitney unintentionally brainwashes his younger brother, 7-year-old Sam, making Sam believe that he is a genetically designed child warrior. Josh says that Sam is actually an acronym, and that he is a \\"Strategically Altered Mutant\\" that was designed by the government to fight in a secret war in Africa. After a series of various suspicious coincidences in Josh's lies, Sam eventually believes that he is a S.A.M. Josh says that he can be safely deactivated and turned back into a human if he reaches Canada. After a thunderstorm grounds their flight in Dallas forcing them to stay in a hotel, Josh grows impatient with his mother and decides to abandon Sam and his life. Blocked at all exits by hotel officials, he heads into a high school reunion to seek refuge. He later lies that his mother was a graduate, and he finds Derek Baxter, a drunken man claiming to be his father. Before Josh has time to clear his lie, Sam appears and, shortly thereafter, Derek drives them to their \\"grandparents'\\" house to tell the good news. Upon entering the house, Derek overreacts to a picture of the real family and goes after Josh. After Sam hits him with a cue-ball, Josh reacts defensively and hits Derek on the head with a pool cue, supposedly \\"killing\\" him. In panic, the two brothers steal his rental car and begin their trek to Canada. After a day of Josh and Sam taking turns driving they encounter Allison, who is an older teen runaway from Hannibal, Missouri. They pick her up due to a resemblance to the Liberty Makd; to another lie of Josh's. According to the Liberty Maid's description she aids fleeing S.A.M.s to Canada, in the similar way of Harriet Tubman. Allison travels with the brothers as their driver and during the run develops a bond with Josh. After a run-in with a cop outside of Salt Lake City, Sam flees, causing a chase through the desert that nearly kills Sam as he crawls under a train. After Josh and Allison reach the car, they dash to the road to continue their journey. During a night stop in a motel, Sam decides to leave Josh and Allison and he steals the car. Later that day, Josh and Alison part ways after she fails to convince him to live in Seattle with her. After a long walk, he discovers the car on the side of the road. Unfortunately, Sam is not there, but he discovers a bus stop nearby and rides it the rest of the way to Canada. On the bus, he sees Sam riding on the back of a semi-truck and, after he and Sam reunite, they walk across the border into Canada. In Calgary, Canada, Josh tries several attempts to unbrainwash his brother back to \\"normal\\". Among these attempts is a trip to a tanning booth explaing that it will \\"deactivate him.\\" After this, Sam is sent back home to Orlando on a plane. Feeling unwanted at home and ridiculously considering himself a fugitive, Josh stays behind. When Sam arrives in Orlando he is picked up by their dad, Thom, who gives Sam a big hug and kiss. On the way home, Thom says that he went to Dallas and talked to the police there and he found out that Derek is still alive and Josh only briefly knocked him unconscious. Josh finds this information out also. At home Thom asks Sam where Josh is. Sam thinks Thom doesn't love his brother. Thom says that it's a cruel & mean world out there and that he just wants Josh to be tougher and stronger than he was so that he could be ready.

By age 12, he worked as a deckhand on a river flatboat. He then returned to Clark County and married Mary Greenlee Stewart, who was 16 at the time. Stewart is credited for teaching John Denton how to read and write. In 1826, Denton worked as a local preacher in Clark County, and in 1833, joined the Missouri Conference of the Methodist Church, and became a circuit preacher in Arkansas and Southern Missouri for a year, before returning to Clark County and being a local preacher once more. In 1837, John Denton resumed life as a circuit preacher, this time in the Sulphur Fork Circuit, which included Red River and Lamar Counties in Texas. In the fall of 1837, he crossed the Red River into Texas along with fellow minister Littleton Fowler. His family remained in Hempstead County, Arkansas, but in 1838, the Dentons moved to Clarksville, Texas. Denton gained a reputation for being a skillful orator, although the job was hard as it paid very low and Denton was worked very long hours.  Law career  In 1838, Denton started to study law. He formed a partnership with John B. Craig, a part-time Methodist preacher, who stayed behind while Denton went and attended court cases. Denton and Craig \\"speculated in thousands of acres of land in the newly opened northeast territory.\\" His skills as a preacher also helped him to present many cases. His traveling also permits him to preach, and he gave one of the first sermons ever in Fannin and Grayson Counties, in Old Warren on the county line. He was an active member of the Masonic Lodge at De Kalb and helped establish Constatine Lodge 13 at Fort Warren.  Military Career and Death  In 1839, Denton was called to be in a volunteer militia, and promptly replied to join. In 1841, the Fourth Brigade of the Texas Militia, led by Brig. Gen. Edward H. Tarrant was called upon to find an attack party of Native Americans that had previously killed the Ripley family that lived south of Clarksville. The group located and took the first two villages they found, which belonged to the Keechi Indians, but they found a third one and when they tried to take it, they were met with gunfire. Denton and Henry Stout, an aide of Tarrant, were going on two separate paths, each with a group of scouts when the paths converged. Stout stayed back, but Denton went forward and both were shot. Stout survived, but that shot that Denton had taken would kill him, and the brigade retreated and buried Denton in what would later be territory of Denton County. Denton is now buried in his namesake county and city, on the southeast corner of the lawn of the Denton County Courthouse-on- the-Square. References External links *John B. Denton biography *John B.

Owned by Schurz Communications, the station was operated by Gray Television under a local marketing agreement (LMA) for its last four months on the air before its license was returned to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 31, 2017 as a result of the FCC's 2016 spectrum auction. KGHZ's transmitter was located on Switchgrass Road, north of Fordland. For most of its history, it served as the Springfield‚ÄìBranson market's ABC affiliate, a role now served by KSPR-LD. History The station first signed on the air on March 9, 1983 as KSPR; it was the first independent station in the Springfield market. KSPR was founded by Springfield TV Association Ltd. The station originally operated from studio facilities located on South Glenstone Avenue in eastern Springfield. The following year, it sold channel 33 to the broadcasting unit of television production company Telepictures (later renamed Lorimar- Telepictures); the sale was approved by the FCC on December 12, 1984.Television and Cable Factbook 2014 The following February, Telepictures pursued an affiliation with ABC. On April 3, 1986, ABC decided to terminate its affiliation with KDEB-TV (channel 27, now MyNetworkTV affiliate KOZL-TV) and the network subsequently moved to KSPR. It was at this time KSPR moved to the Saint Louis Street facility. Over the next several years, KSPR underwent several ownership changes. Lorimar-Telepictures sold the station to Goltrin Communications in 1987; the sale was approved by the FCC on February 12, 1988. Goltrin subsequently sold KSPR to Davis Goldfarb Communications several months later, with the sale being finalized on December 1, 1988. Cottonwood Communications acquired the station on March 29, 1995. Two years later, KSPR was sold to GOCOM Communications; which assumed ownership of the station on September 18, 1997. The station changed its branding to \\"ABC 33\\" around this time, before adopting the \\"Springfield 33\\" brand in 1998. GOCOM then merged with Grapevine Communications to form GOCOM Holdings LLC, which was later renamed Piedmont Television Holdings, on November 1, 1999. On September 21, 2006, Piedmont Television announced that it would sell KSPR to Perkin Media, LLC. Under the agreement, South Bend, Indiana-based Schurz Communications, owners of NBC affiliate KYTV (channel 3), would take over KSPR's operations under a shared services agreement; the FCC approved the sale on August 18, 2007 and the purchase was finalized on August 28, 2007. Two weeks later on September 9, the station changed its on-air branding to \\"KSPR ABC\\"; a gray and black \\"33\\" was added to the logo first introduced with the rebrand in November 2009. On November 1, 2009, KSPR relocated its operations from its longtime studios on East Saint Louis Street into KYTV's facility on West Sunshine Street in an expanded wing of the building. Final KSPR logo, until 2017. Retained by KSPR-LD. KSPR has been digital-only since February 17, 2009. Schurz announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including KYTV, K15CZ-D (channel 15), and the SSA with KSPR, to Gray Television for $442.5 million. Schurz subsequently agreed to exercise its option to purchase KSPR on December 15, 2015; the transfer, which was contingent on the completion of the sale of KYTV and the rest of its television division to Gray, called for the termination of KSPR's joint sales agreement with KYTV and for the KSPR license to be entered into the FCC's broadcast incentive auction.Application for Consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License - Federal Communications Commission The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2016,FCC Approves Gray-Schurz TV Station Deal.

On February 1, 2017, channel 33's call letters were changed to KGHZ (a likely reference to the spectrum auction); the KSPR call letters are now used by the former K15CZ-D, which changed its call letters from KYCW-LD to KSPR-LD on the same day. Shortly after the callsign change, KGHZ swapped its virtual channel 33 position and ABC affiliation with KSPR-LD, with KGHZ's primary virtual channel mapping to 15.1. Through all of this, the on-air day-to-day operations of KSPR went unchanged on their new signal outside of mentions for over-the-air viewers to rescan the KYCW-LD signal to continue to watch ABC programming. As KGHZ, the station maintained carried Antenna TV on its main subchannel until May 31, when the station went off the air and its license was turned into the FCC the same day.

Programming As an ABC affiliate, KSPR carried the entire network schedule, with all programs airing in pattern. =Locally produced programming= On April 21, 1989, KSPR debuted The Late Night Horror Show with Count Norlock, a showcase of syndicated horror films that featured locally produced wraparound introductory and interstitial segments. Segments were hosted by local actor Jim Kellett in the role of \\"Count Norlock\\", a vampire reminiscent of Count Orlok from the 1922 F. W. Murnau film Nosferatu. Featuring films such as Magic and The Brides of Dracula, The Late Night Horror Show with Count Norlock only lasted one season, being cancelled later that year. From 1985 to 1990, KSPR produced the local afternoon children's program Sammy's Place, which was hosted by actor Wayne Milnes in the role of hobo clown \\"Sammy B. Good.\\" The program featured cartoons such as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, She-Ra: Princess of Power, Voltron, Transformers and G.I. Joe. Between the programs, Sammy featured area children as in-studio guests and entertained with a number of clown acts and skits; he famously excited the in-studio kids with screams of \\"Everybody go 'yeaaaa'!,\\" which would be echoed in unison. =Notable former on-air staff= *Mark Steines - anchor/reporter (later anchor/correspondent for Entertainment Tonight, then host of The Home and Family Show) References Category:1983 establishments in Missouri Category:2017 disestablishments in Missouri Category:Television channels and stations established in 1983 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2017 GHZ Category:Gray Television Category:Defunct terrestrial television stations in the United States GHZ ","title":"KGHZ"},{"id":"3383881","text":"The Center for American Politics and Citizenship (CAPC) is a non-partisan Government and Politics research center at the University of Maryland, College Park The Center's stated mission is that it \\"provides citizens and policy- makers with research on critical issues related to the United States's political institutions, processes, and policies.

The term is also used more broadly to include the Nazis' systematic murder of millions of people in other groups they determined were \\"untermensch\\" or \\"subhuman,\\" which included primarily the Jews and the Slavs, the former having allegedly infected the latter, including ethnic Poles, the Serbs, Russians, the Czechs and others. Other groups targeted for racial and other reasons were the Romani or \\"Gypsies,\\" Baltic people (especially the Lithuanians), people with disabilities, gay men, and political and religious opponents,Niewyk, Donald L. and Nicosia, Francis R. The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, pp. 45-52. which would bring the total number of Holocaust victims 17 million people.Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths, would produce a death toll of 17 million. Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war is unclear. Overall, about 5.7 million (78 percent) of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe perished (Gilbert, Martin. Atlas of the Holocaust 1988, pp. 242-244). Compared to five to 11 million (1.4 percent to 3.0 percent) of the 360 million non-Jews in German-dominated Europe. Small, Melvin and J. David Singer.

New York: New York University Press, 1990 In Judaism, Shoah (◊©◊ï◊ê◊î), meaning \\"calamity\\" in Hebrew, became the standard term for the 20th-century Holocaust (see Yom HaShoah). Names =The Holocaust= The word \\"holocaust\\" originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning \\"a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering,\\" or \\"a burnt sacrifice offered to a god.\\" In Greek and Roman pagan rites, gods of the earth and underworld received dark animals, which were offered by night and burnt in full. The word \\"holocaust\\" was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the olah,Olah (Leviticus 1:1-17) lit.: 'what goes up', \\".. i.e goes up in smoke, because the entire animal, except for its hide, was burned on the altar. Other types of sacrifice were consumed in part by fire .. In English, olah has for centuries been translated 'burnt offering.\\" The olah had a high degree of sanctity, and it was regarded as the 'standard' sacrifice. .. In contrast, sacrifices made by the Greeks to the Olympian gods were always shared by the worshipers; only sacrifices made to the dread underground deities to ward off evil were presented as holocausts, i.e., completely burned.\\" W. Gunther Plaut, The Torah - A Modern Commentary; New York: Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 1981 and R.K.

Jewish tradition understood these utterances to be directed not against sacrifices as such, but against the substitution of ritual for morality.\\" ibidem. (Plaut); Leviticus, Part I, Laws of Sacrifice, Introduction, p.752. to make in the times of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple in Jerusalem). In its Latin form, holocaustum, the term was first used with specific reference to a massacre of Jewish people by the chroniclers Roger of HowdenSimon Schama, A History of Britain, episode 3, 'Dynasty'; BBC DVD, 2000 and Richard of Devizes in England in the 1190s. The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of the medieval French monarch Louis VII, wrote that he \\"once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church\\", a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-Fran√ßois in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated. The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.John Milton quotesThe Oxford English Dictionary, Clarendon Press, 2nd ed. Oxford 1989, vol. VII p. 315 sect c.'complete destruction, esp. of a large number of persons; a great slaughter or massacre' citing examples from 1883 onwards. In the late 19th century, holocaust was used in 1895 by the American newspaper The New York Times to describe the Ottoman massacre of Armenian Christians page 1 of . In the early twentieth century, possibly the first to use the term was journalist Melville Chater in 1925, to describe the burning and sacking of Smyrna in 1922 in the context of the Turkish genocide against Anatolian Christians.Colin Martin Tatz, \\"With Intent to Destroy: Reflecting on Genocide\\", Verso, 2003, p. 18M. Chater, \\"History's Greatest Trek\\", National Geographic, 1925, 533-583.

With reference to the events of the war, writers in English from 1945 used the term in relation to events such as the fire-bombing of Dresden or Hiroshima, or the effects of a nuclear war, although from the 1950s onwards, it was increasingly used in English to refer to the Nazi genocide of the European Jews (or Judeocide). By the late 1950s, documents translated from Hebrew sometimes used the word \\"Holocaust\\" to translate \\"Shoah\\", as the Judeocide. This use can be found as early as May 23, 1943, in The New York Times, on page E6, in an article by Julian Meltzer, referring to feelings in Palestine about Jewish immigration of refugees from \\"the Nazi holocaust.\\" One significant early use was in a 1958 recollection by Leslie Hardman, the first Jewish British Army Chaplain to enter Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945, where he ministered to survivors and supervised the burial of about 20,000 victims, > Towards me came what seemed to be the remnants of a holocaust ‚Äì a staggering > mass of blackened skin and bones, held together somehow with filthy rags. > 'My God, the dead walk', I cried aloud, but I did not recognise my voice... > [peering] at the double star, the emblem of Jewry on my tunic - one poor > creature touched and then stroked the badge of my faith, and finding that it > was real murmured, 'Rabbiner, Rabbiner'.Hardman, Leslie and Cecily Goodman > 'The Survivors: the story of the Belsen Remnant' London: Vallentine, > Mitchell,(1958) By the late 1960s, the term was starting to be used in this sense without qualification. Nora Levin's 1968 book The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry, 1933-1945 explains the meaning in its subtitle, but uses the unmoderated phrase \\"The Holocaust\\". An article called \\"Moral Trauma and the Holocaust\\" was published in the New York Times on February 12, 1968.page 37, by Eliot Fremont-Smith However, it was not until the late 1970s that the Nazi genocide became the generally accepted conventional meaning of the word, when used unqualified and with a capital letter, a usage that also spread to other languages for the same period.Harnessing the Holocaust: The Politics of Memory in France, Jewish Quarterly Review, Volume 96, Number 2, Spring 2006, pp. 304-306 The 1978 television miniseries titled \\"Holocaust\\" and starring Meryl Streep is often cited as the principal contributor to establishing the current usage in the wider culture.Garaudy, Roger, \\"The Mythical Foundations of Israeli Policy\\", Studies Forum International, London 1997, p.133 \\"Holocaust\\" was selected as the Association for the German Language's Word of the Year in 1979, reflecting increased public consciousness of the term. The Hebrew word Shoah is preferred by some people due to the supposed theologically and historically unacceptable nature of the word \\"holocaust\\".\\"It is the rejection of even the hint of such sacrificial thinking that prompts some Jews to refuse to refer to the events of the Shoah as a 'holocaust', the burnt offering with smoke wafting up to heaven\\".

Bartoszewski, The Convent at Auschwitz; New York: George Braziller, 1991. The American historian Walter Laqueur (whose parents died in the Holocaust) has argued that the term \\"Holocaust\\" is a \\"singularly inappropriate\\" term for the genocide of the Jews as it implies a \\"burnt offering\\" to God.Evans, Richard. In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 142. Laqueur wrote, \\"It was not the intention of the Nazis to make a sacrifice of this kind and the position of the Jews was not that of a ritual victim\\". The British historian Geoff Eley wrote in a 1982 essay entitled \\"Holocaust History\\" that he thought the term Holocaust implies \\"a certain mystification, an insistence on the uniquely Jewish character of the experience\\". The term became increasingly widespread as a synonym for \\"genocide\\" in the last decades of the 20th century to refer to mass murders in the form \\"X holocaust\\" (e.g. \\"Rwandan holocaust\\"). Examples are Rwanda, Ukraine under Stalin, and the actions of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In order to suggest comparison with Nazi murders other historical events have also been labeled \\"Holocausts\\", for example the oppression of lower caste groups in India (\\"Sudra Holocaust\\") or the slave trade (\\"African Holocaust\\"). Use of the term for non-Jewish victims of the Nazis Rough approximation of Holocaust deaths according to a broad definition that includes non-Jews, such as Romani, Slavs, Soviet POWs and political opponents (click image for more details). While the terms Shoah and Final Solution always refer to the fate of the Jews during the Nazi rule, the term Holocaust is sometimes used in a wider sense to describe other genocides of the Nazi and other regimes. The Columbia Encyclopedia defines \\"Holocaust\\" as \\"name given to the period of persecution and extermination of European Jews by Nazi Germany\\".Bartleby.com The Compact Oxford English Dictionary\\"The Holocaust\\", Compact Oxford English Dictionary: \\"(the Holocaust) the mass murder of Jews under the German Nazi regime in World War II.\\" and Microsoft Encarta\\"Holocaust\\" , Encarta: \\"Holocaust, the almost complete destruction of Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II (1939‚Äì1945).

Jews often refer to the Holocaust as Shoah (from the Hebrew word for \\"catastrophe\\" or \\"total destruction\\").\\" give similar definitions.

They were the only other group that the Nazis systematically killed in gas chambers alongside the Jews.\\" Scholars are divided on whether the term Holocaust should be applied to all victims of Nazi mass murder, with some using it synonymously with Shoah or \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\", and others including the killing of Romani peoples, Poles, the deaths of Soviet prisoners of war, Slavs, homosexual men, Jehovah's Witnesses, the disabled, and political opponents.*Weissman, Gary.

They say that the word was originally meant to describe the extermination of the Jews, and that the Jewish Holocaust was a crime on such a scale, and of such totality and specificity, as the culmination of the long history of European antisemitism, that it should not be subsumed into a general category with the other crimes of the Nazis.Michael Berenbaum Berenbaum, Michael.

British historian Michael Burleigh and German historian Wolfgang Wippermann maintain that although all Jews were victims, the Holocaust transcended the confines of the Jewish community ‚Äì other people shared the tragic fate of victimhood.Michael Burleigh and Wolfgang Wippermann. The Racial State:Germany 1933‚Äì1945 Cambridge University Press 1991. This work favors a more expansive definition of the Holocaust, pointing out that Nazi Germany had a racist ideology by no means limited to anti-Semitism. Hungarian former Minister for Roma Affairs L√°szl√≥ Teleki applies the term Holocaust to both the murder of Jews and Romani peoples by the Nazis. In The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, American historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia use the term to include Jews, Romani and the disabled.The Columbia guide to the Holocaust by Donald L. Niewyk, Francis R. Nicosia, page 52, Columbia University Press, 2000 American historian Dennis Reinhartz has claimed that Gypsies were the main victims of genocide in Croatia and Serbia during the Second World War, and has called this \\"the Balkan Holocaust 1941-1945\\".Chapter 6 in the book The Gypsies of Eastern Europe, pp.81-92, ME Sharpe, London, 1991 =Final Solution= The \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" (German: Endl√∂sung der Judenfrage) was the Nazis' own term, recorded in the minutes of the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, and translated into English for the Nuremberg Trials in 1945. Before the word \\"Holocaust\\" became normative this phrase was also used by writers in English. For example, in William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the genocide is described as \\"The Final Solution\\" (in quotation marks; the word \\"Holocaust\\" is not mentioned).Shirer, W., The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich New York: 1960, Simon and Schuster, pp. 963-979 In both English and German, \\"Final Solution\\" has been widely used as an alternative to \\"Holocaust\\".A useful analysis of the terms can be found in Bartov, Omer. \\"Antisemitism, the Holocaust, and Reinterpretation of National Socialism\\", in Berenbaum, Michael & Peck, Abraham J. (eds.), The Holocaust and History: The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed, and the Reexamined, Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 1998, pp. 75‚Äì98. Whereas the term \\"Holocaust\\" is now often used to include all casualties of the Nazi death camps and murder squads, the \\"Final Solution\\" refers exclusively to \\"the attempt to annihilate the Jewish people,\\" as defined at the site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. For a time after World War II, German historians also used the term V√∂lkermord (\\"genocide\\"), or in full, der V√∂lkermord an den Juden (\\"the genocide of the Jewish people\\"), while the prevalent term in Germany today is either Holocaust or increasingly Shoah. =Shoah= The biblical word Shoah (◊©◊ï◊ê◊î), also spelled Shoa and Sho'ah, meaning \\"calamity\\" in Hebrew (and also used to refer to \\"destruction\\" since the Middle Ages), became the standard Hebrew term for the 20th-century Holocaust as early as the early 1940s. In recent literature it is specifically prefixed with Ha (\\"The\\" in Hebrew) when referring to Nazi mass-murders, for the same reason that \\"holocaust\\" becomes \\"The Holocaust\\". It may be spelled Ha-Shoah or HaShoah, as in Yom HaShoah, the annual Jewish \\"Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day\\". Shoah had earlier been used in the context of the Nazis as a translation of \\"catastrophe\\". For example, in 1934, when Chaim Weizmann told the Zionist Action Committee that Hitler's rise to power was \\"an unforeseen catastrophe, comparable to another world war\\" (), the Hebrew press translated Katastrophe as Shoah.Setbon, Jessica. \\"Who Beat My Father? Issues of Terminology and Translation in Teaching the Holocaust\\", workshop from a May 2006 conference; see Yad Vashem website. Yadvashem.org In the spring of 1942, the Jerusalem historian BenZion Dinur (Dinaburg) used Shoah in a book published by the United Aid Committee for the Jews in Poland to describe the extermination of Europe's Jews, calling it a \\"catastrophe\\" that symbolized the unique situation of the Jewish people.Holocaust, Yad Vashem\\"Holocaust‚ÄîDefinition\\", Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, Vol. II, MacMillan. The word Shoah was chosen in Israel to describe the Holocaust, the term institutionalized by the Knesset on April 12, 1951, when it established Yom Ha-Shoah Ve Mered Ha-Getaot, the national day of remembrance. In the 1950s, Yad Vashem, the Israel \\"Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority\\" was routinely translating this into English as \\"the Disaster\\". At that time, holocaust was often used to mean the conflagration of much of humanity in a nuclear war.Petrie, Jon. \\"The Secular Word 'HOLOCAUST': Scholarly Myths, History, and Twentieth Century Meanings\\", Journal of Genocide Research Vol 2, no. 1 (2000): 31‚Äì63. Since then, Yad Vashem has changed its practice; the word \\"Holocaust\\", usually now capitalized, has come to refer principally to the genocide of the European Jews.\\"\\"The Holocaust: Definition and Preliminary Discussion\\", Yad Vashem. Retrieved June 8, 2005. The Israeli historian Saul Friedl√§nder wrote in 1987 of \\"the growing centrality of the Shoah for Jewish communities in the Diaspora\\" and that \\"The Shoah is almost becoming a symbol of identification, for better or for worse, whether because of the weakening of the bond of religion or because of the lesser salience of Zionism and Israel as an identification element\\". The British historian Richard J. Evans wrote in 1989 that the term Holocaust was unsuitable, and should not be used. = Khurban and destruction = 'khurbn eyrope (), is the term for the Holocaust in Yiddish. The term uses the word 'Khurbn' (alternately spelled Churban) of Hebrew origin (; Hebrew pronunciation: 'Khur'ban') which means \\"Destruction\\", and translates as \\"Destruction of Europe\\". The word \\"Khur'ban/'Khurbn\\" is also used for the destruction of both the First and the Second Temple in both Hebrew and Yiddish. Max Kaufmann's early (1947) history of the genocide in Latvia was called Khurbn Lettland, that is, The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia.Kaufmann, Max, Die Vernichtung des Judens Lettlands (The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia), Munich, 1947, English translation by Laimdota Mazzarins available on-line as Churbn Lettland -- The Destruction of the Jews of Latvia Published later, Raul Hilberg's most important work was The Destruction of the European Jews.Hilberg, Raul, The Destruction of the European Jews (3rd edition) Yale University Press, New Haven, CT 2003. =Porajmos= The Porajmos (also Porrajmos) literally \\"Devouring\\", or Samudaripen (\\"Mass killing\\") is a term adopted by the Romani historian Ian Hancock to describe attempts by the Nazis to exterminate most of the Romani peoples of Europe. The phenomenon has been little studied. See also *Silent Holocaust (disambiguation).

It is a retelling of 25 fairy tales, particularly those by The Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, and Hans Christian Andersen, plus the poem \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\". Shelley Duvall is the series creator, host, executive producer alongside Bridget Terry and Fred Fuchs, occasional star and narrator, and voice of the animatronic Nightingale. The series was directed by luminaries such as Francis Ford Coppola, Emile Ardolino, and Tim Burton, and features numerous Hollywood stars in character roles. This is one of the first examples of cable original programming, alongside HBO's Fraggle Rock. The series was followed by three other less successful shorter anthology series produced by Duvall: Tall Tales & Legends (9 episodes), which follows the same format as Faerie Tale Theatre and focuses on classic American folk tales, Nightmare Classics (4 episodes produced out of the planned 6), and Bedtime Stories(12 episodes). Background Shelley Duvall began conception of Faerie Tale Theatre while filming the live-action film Popeye in Malta. She reportedly asked her co-star, Robin Williams, his opinion on \\"The Frog Prince\\", a fairy tale she was reading during production. Williams thought it was funny and would later star in the namesake pilot episode of the series, written, narrated and directed by Monty Python's Eric Idle, who himself would appear in the future episode \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\". Many of the episodes produced by Fred Fuchs in association with Duvall, were written by Rod Ash, Mark Curtiss, Maryedith Burrell and Robert C. Jones. Episodes open with Duvall introducing herself and giving a brief synopsis of the fairy tale to follow. Each episode features live-action adaptations, with celebrities from the performance world in costume. Duvall features in 3 episodes and narrates three others. Episodes Artwork Many episodes feature backdrops and settings inspired by specific artists and children's book illustrators, including Maxfield Parrish (\\"The Frog Prince\\"), Norman Rockwell (\\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\"), Arthur Rackham (\\"Hansel and Gretel\\"), Edmund Dulac (\\"The Nightingale\\"), Aubrey Beardsley and Harry Clarke (\\"The Princess and the Pea\\") Gustav Klimt (\\"Rapunzel\\"), N.

The chain began in October 1995. History The Scream by Edvard Munch The pub chain was set up by brewers Bass, who called it It's a Scream. The pubs were all within relatively short walking distance of a university. Bass's retail arm became Mitchells & Butlers in April 2003. Scream was disposed of by Mitchells and Butlers on 20 August 2010, along with around 300 other Mitchells and Butlers pubs for ¬£373m to Stonegate (owned by TDR Capital).TDR CapitalStonegate sale August 2010  Theme  Scream pubs were aimed at the student market, and mostly found near to universities. They claimed to be 'the number one choice of students'. Its chief competitor was Varsity, owned at the time by the Barracuda Group, although Varsity had a more mainstream market ‚Äì often concentrating on football matches on Sky Sports and located closer to town centres. Varsity became part of Stonegate in 2013.https://www.hospitalityandcateringnews.com/2013/11/stonegate- acquires-78-bramwell-pubs-from-administrator/ The original name came from the 1893 painting The Scream, by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, which is a popular poster image with many students. The painting was formerly shown on some pub signs of the former It's A Scream chain. The pubs each had individual items, for example a giant monkey mural (Horn in Hand), a talking moose's head (White Harte, Bristol), an aardvark costume (The Aardvark, Coventry) or a large painting of a Phoenix (The Phoenix, Coventry) and their own sign relating to their name. Some went further, such as the Dry Dock in Leeds and Leicester which were built inside of an old grounded ship. Scream pubs had a loyalty card scheme known as The Yellow Card. It was available to students annually for ¬£1 (originally free) and entitled them to discounts on selected food and drink. In November 2006, selected Scream Pubs had been chosen to run a trial wherein they did not sell Yellow Cards. With the introduction of the new Scottish Licensing Laws on 1 September 2009, Yellow Cards purchased in Scream pubs in Scotland would not be valid until 72 hours after purchase. In the Summer of 2003, Scream introduced the \\"Yellow Card For Life\\" ‚Äì costing ¬£5, with the promise that it will never expire. =Former locations= There were 50 Scream pubs spread around the UK when Stonegate took over the chain, with the vast majority being in towns and cities with a significant student population.

Another scream bar in Portsmouth, The Registry closed at the end of March 2010. It was renamed The Kraken Wakes as part of an ongoing partnership between independent pub operator Fiveeightzero and the owner, Mitchells & Butlers. It opened at the end of April 2010 following a refurbishment. The new name was short lived, as the establishment reverted to the original name of The Registry in March 2011. However, It closed once again on 1 June 2014 and was converted into student halls of residence, which opened in September 2015. 'The Queen of Hearts' and 'The Cheshire Cat' in Fallowfield, Manchester, were never sold by Mitchells and Butlers in late 2010. They still operated as Scream Pub, but all branding had to be removed. As of 15 April 2011, The pub has been sold to Hydes Pub Company, and is now a Hydes pub. 'Robinskis' in Fallowfield was taken over by Stonegate in late 2010. Due to various disputes within the company regarding profits and poor management has been for Sale since Day one of ownership. As of 6 May 2011 the pub has been sold to an independent owner. Robinskis is now operating as a private pub; all instances of Scream have been removed and the pub will operate as normally. Scream had 67 pubs under its name at the time of Sale. Stonegate bought 62 of these pubs. The other five stayed under Michells and Butlers until they were sold on to other buyers. Since Stonegate have taken over, the following 14 pubs have been sold by Stonegate: Euston * The Junction in Harrow * The Kinston Mill in Kingston upon Thames * The Robbins Well in Leamington Spa * The Quayside in Lincoln * The Park in Luton * Robinskis in Manchester * The Phoenix in Manchester * The Queen of Hearts and The Cheshire Cat in Manchester * The Lot in Richmond Common Room Starting with the Southfield, Stonegate began converting existing Scream sites to a new 'Common Room' brand, rather than branding each site as a uniform segment, instead brands each site individually.http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Operators/MA500-Business- Club/Stonegate-Common-Room The sites focus more on casual dining and an emerging interest in craft beer. Typically sites having converted to the new brand saw an increase in sales of roughly 60%, with success based on a change to multiple visits by customers during the day.

Early life In 1964, Sterling joined Associated Electrical Industries (later General Electric Company plc) as a student apprentice. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Sheffield to read electronic and electrical engineering. He graduated with a 1st class honours degree and subsequently a PhD degree in computer control in 1971. Academic career He joined the Department of Control Engineering at the University of Sheffield as a lecturer and was promoted to senior lecturer in 1978. He then moved to the University of Durham as a professor of Engineering in 1980, before being appointed as Vice- Chancellor of Brunel University in 1990. He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1991. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham from October 2001 to April 2009. In July 2009 he was appointed chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, the agency responsible for funding big science in the United Kingdom. He was chairman of the Russell Group, representing the United Kingdom‚Äôs twenty leading research-intensive universities at a crucial time in higher education history, when the white paper on tuition fees was being debated and subsequently passed. He was also a board member of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), a board member of Advantage West Midlands (the regional RDA), a member of AWM‚Äôs Innovation and Technology Council and chair of AWM‚Äôs Information and Communication Technology Steering Group. In addition he is a member of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Council for Science and Technology and chairman of its energy sub-group. At Brunel, Sterling oversaw the consolidation of the University and a merger with the West London Institute of Higher Education, which produced a multi-sited university with a student body of 12,000. More controversially, he closed the Departments of Physics and Chemistry, and oversaw the award of an honorary doctorate to Dame Margaret Thatcher, against strong union and student resistance. On his appointment to Birmingham, Sterling said that he was 'looking forward immensely to the challenge of leading the University of Birmingham into its 2nd century. It is a great international university which has not forgotten its local roots. There is huge potential in the University, the City of Birmingham and the West Midlands region'. In addition, he said that he relished 'the opportunity of working with new colleagues to achieve our common purpose of maintaining and improving Birmingham's position in the front rank of universities'. During his time at Birmingham, Sterling was at the forefront of estates developments, creating a new skyline for the campus which includes the Institute for Biomedical Research, the Business School, the Sport and Exercise Sciences building and new halls of residence including Mason Hall and the Shackleton hub. The building stock was significantly improved and the old Muirhead Tower redesigned. Having an engineering background, two initiatives that Sterling is particularly proud to have secured for Birmingham, are the HEFCE-funded National Higher Education STEM Programme, to increase the number of graduates with skills in science, technology, engineering and maths disciplines to fulfill the needs of employers and boost the UK economy, and establishing the Energy Technologies Institute alongside Nottingham and Loughborough Universities. Sterling retired in April 2009, following more than 19 years as a Vice-Chancellor, eight of those at Birmingham. His last major act as Vice-Chancellor was to bequeath a restructuring of the University on his successor, David Eastwood. Honours Sterling was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to higher education, science and engineering.

Its present course is so altered that it is no longer a tributary of the Scamander, but flows directly into the Hellespont.  Family  Like other river-gods, Simoeis was the son of Oceanus and Tethys. Simoeis had two daughters who were married into the Trojan royal family. One daughter, Astyoche, was married to Erichthonius, and the other daughter, Hieromneme was the wife of Assaracus.  Mythology  When the gods took sides in the Trojan War, Simoeis supported the Trojans. Scamander, another river who also supported the Trojans, called upon Simoeis for help in his battle against Achilles: > \\"Come to my aid with all speed, fill your streams with water from your > springs, stir up all your torrents, stand high in a great wave, and rouse a > mighty roar of timbers and rocks, so we can stop this savage man who in his > strength is raging like the gods.\\" (Iliad, 21.311-15). Before Simoeis could respond, Hephaestus was able to save Achilles by subduing Scamander with flame.  Trojan descendants   References  * March, J. Cassell's Dictionary Of Classical Mythology.

Zebra stripes are visible on the left back leg. The dun gene also produces light guard hairs in the mane and the tail. Grullo or grulla, also called blue dun, gray dun or mouse dun, is a color of horses in the dun family, characterized by tan-gray or mouse-colored hairs on the body, often with shoulder and dorsal stripes and black barring on the lower legs. In this coloration, each individual hair is mouse-colored, unlike a roan, which is composed of a mixture of dark and light hairs. The several shades of grulla are informally referred to with a variety of terms, including black dun, blue dun, slate grulla, silver grulla or light grulla, silver dun, or lobo dun. Silver grulla may also refer to a grullo horse with silver dapple, regardless of shade. In the Icelandic horse, the grulla color is called gray dun, in the Highland pony it is called mouse dun, and in the Norwegian Fjord horse, gr√• or gr√•blakk (literally, \\"gray dun\\"). The word \\"grullo\\" originates from the Spanish word for a gray horse and the word \\"grulla\\" in Spanish means crane. Because of the origin of the name, some people will refer to a mare as a grulla and a stallion or gelding as a grullo, pronounced and . (The original Spanish noun is pronounced in American Spanish and in Peninsular Spanish.) A Heck horse In terms of equine coat color genetics, all of these shades are based on the dun gene acting as a dilution gene over the black gene. Because the grulla color is not due to the gray gene, a grulla horse remains the same basic color from birth, though some minor shade variation may occur from summer to winter coats. If a grulla also carries the gray gene, it will be born a mouse tan-gray shade, usually with bold primitive markings, but then lighten and eventually develop a white hair coat with age. Because black is less common in general than bay or chestnut, grulla is likewise less common than red duns or bay (classic or zebra) duns. For example, only 0.7% of quarter horses registered each year with the AQHA are grulla. The most obvious ways to tell whether a horse is grulla are not only the gray or tan-gray body color, but also its primitive markings, which include some or all of the following: dark face, cobwebbing around the eyes and forehead, dark mottling on the body, leg barring (sometimes called tiger striping), dark ear tips and edging, dark ear barring, dark shadowing of the neck, dark dorsal and transverse striping, and light guard hairs bordering a dark mane and tail. Primitive roots The tarpan (Equus ferus ferus) was a relative of the domestic horse that became extinct in the nineteenth century, and which appears to have had grulla coloration. The tarpan has been considered a true wild horse, an undomesticated relative or ancestor of the domestic horse. However, some authorities in the early twentieth century held the opinion that most equines called tarpans were actually domestic or feral horses, not a separate species. Several breeds with the grulla color have been developed in efforts to recreate (\\"breed back\\") the tarpan. These breeds include the Heck horse and Konik. One of the first experiments in this regard was published in 1906 by James Cossar Ewart, who obtained a \\"tarpan-like\\" horse by crossing a Shetland mare and a black Welsh pony.

Detail Many consider acts of desecration to be sacrilegious acts. This can include desecration of sacred books, sacred places or sacred objects. Desecration generally may be considered from the perspective of a particular religion or spiritual activity. Desecration may be applied to natural systems or components, particularly if those systems are part of naturalistic spiritual religion. To respectfully remove the sacred character of a place or an object is deconsecration, and is distinct from desecration. Some religions, such as the Roman Catholic Church have specific rules as to what constitutes desecration and what should be done in these circumstances.  Examples  =In Judaism= In Judaism, the \\"Desecration of God's Name\\" meaning the desecration of any aspect of Judaism and its beliefs and practices as commanded in the Torah and Jewish Law and hence of God, is known as Chillul Hashem from the Hebrew meaning \\"[the] Desecration [of] the Name [of] God\\". In some instances to avoid Chillul Hashem Judaism would require that its adherents die as martyrs. The opposite or converse of Chillul Hashem in Judaism is Kiddush Hashem meaning \\"Sanctification [of] the Name of God\\". =Christianization of the Roman Empire= Examples of the destruction of pagan temples in the late fourth century, as recorded in surviving texts, describe Martin of Tours' attacks on holy sites in Gaul,Life of St. Martin the destruction of temples in Syria by Marcellus Edward Gibbon, \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\", ch28 the destruction of temples and images in, and surrounding, Carthage,R.

This is supplemented in abundance by archaeological evidence in the northern provinces exposing broken and burnt out buildings and hastily buried objects of piety. The leader of the Egyptian monks who participated in the sack of temples replied to the victims who demanded back their sacred icons: > I peacefully removed your gods...there is no such thing as robbery for those > who truly possess Christ. At the turn of the century St Augustine gave a sermon to his congregation in Carthage on removing all tangible symbols of paganism:St. Augustine, Sermon 26 from The Works of Saint Augustine, Part III; Sermons 20 to 51, New City Press, 1990, (Weblink: https://wesleyscholar.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Augustine-Sermons-20-51.pdf (PDF)) > Am I saying \\"Stop wanting what you want\\"? On the contrary, we must be > thankful that you want what God wants. That every superstition of the pagans > and the Gentiles should be abolished is what God wants, God has ordered, God > has foretold, God has begun to bring about, and in many parts of the world > has already in great measure achieved. In the year 407 a decree was issued to the west from Rome: > If any images stand even now in the temples and shrines...., they shall be > torn from their foundations...The temples situated in cities or towns shall > be taken for public use. Altars shall be destroyed in all places. Sacred sites were now appropriated by Christianity: \\"Let altars be built and relics be placed there\\" wrote Pope Gregory I, \\"so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God.\\"Ramsay MacMullen, Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries, Yale University Press, 1997. = Red Terror in Spain = Sacred Heart by leftist militiamen at Cerro de los √Ångeles near Madrid, on 7 August 1936, was the most famous of the widespread desecration of images and Churches.Ealham, Chris and Michael Richards, The Splintering of Spain, p. 80, 168, Cambridge University Press, 2005, , King Alfonso XIII had consecrated the nation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus at the spot on May 30, 1919.Burns, Paul and Alban Butler, Lives of the Saints: Supplement of New Saints and Blesseds 2005 Liturgical Press The photograph was taken by a Paramount newsreel representative and originally published in the London Daily Mail with a caption calling it part of the \\"Spanish Reds' war on religion.\\"Shots of War: Photojournalism During the Spanish Civil War The Red Terror in Spain during the Spanish Civil War involved massive desecration of churches, synagogues and other sacred objects and places by leftists.

In all 225 out of 600 mosques in Kosovo were damaged, vandalised, or destroyed alongside other Islamic architecture during the conflict.. Archives belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo with records spanning 500 years were also destroyed. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Revenge attacks against Serbian religious sites commenced following the conflict and the return of hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees to their homes. During violent unrest in 2004, more than 35 Serbian Orthodox church buildings were desecrated, damaged or destroyed.BBC news See also * Desacralization of knowledge * Flag desecration * Host desecration * Qur'an desecration References Category:Religious belief and doctrine Category:Religious persecution Category:Religious discrimination ","title":"Desecration"},{"id":"3383972","text":"The Chino Champion, along with the Chino Hills Champion, is a weekly newspaper serving the Chino Valley area of Southern California.

The first issue of the Champion Valley Champion came off the press on November 11, 1887. Wasson later wrote, \\"The first number appeared before there was but one dwelling north of Chino Creek, and only four or five other buildings, including barns.\\" Mr. Wasson ran 600 to 2000 copies a week. This was tough work, because each piece of type had to be set by hand. Two pages were printed at a time on a foot-powered press. The Los Angeles Herald said of the first issue that the newspaper was \\"already setting forth the merits of this delightful location\\"Headline is unreadable, Los Angeles Herald, January 1, 1888, page 2 and later that the newspaper was a \\"well conducted, artistic little sheet.\\"\\"Border-Land: The Chino,\\" Los Angeles Herald, February 23, 1888, page 5 On the Champion's tenth birthday, its second owner and publisher, Edwin Rhodes, wrote: \\"It is a veritable fact that in the case of Chino a newspaper was started and the town built around it.\\"Chino Valley Champion, October 29, 1897, page 7 In 1891 Wasson was listed as publisher of the newspaper,Chino Valley Champion, March 13, 1891, page 2 but in that year also he left the paper, having bought a half interest in the Pomona Times.The Weekly Courier, San Bernardino, July 18, 1891, page 4 =20th Century= Front page of the Chino Champion, November 11, 1922, 35 years after its first issue Edwin Rhodes was editor for 16 years, from 1890 to 1906, later becoming president of the First National and Chino Savings Bank.\\"Congratulatory Message Sent by Former Editor,\\" Chino Champion, November 11, 1927, page 6 In 1906, Charles A Gardner was owner and publisher.

In 1920, Homan went into law, selling to a Nebraska newspaperman, Elmer Howell Sr. Howell was later joined by his brother-in-law, Charles Frady, and then by nephew E.R. (Bob) Frady, who was the editor until 1949. The Champion published twice a week in the 1920s. In 1956, Allen P. McCombs came to town, right out of navy service. The young college-educated outsider from Berkeley completed 50 years as editor and publisher on October 1, 2006. In 1958, a weekly Shopping News was published on Wednesday and sent to non-subscribers. The Champion continued to publish on Thursday. The need for speedier printing led to the purchase of a used roll- fed Duplex press that printed and folded eight pages at once. During the 1960s, to keep up with trends in the newspaper industry, the Champion converted from \\"hot type\\" to offset. By 1970, the Duplex had been scrapped and the printing was \\"farmed out\\" to a larger printing firm in Riverside. Less than a year later two-thirds of the building was gutted by fire, started by a Molotov cocktail thrown during a period of ethnic strife. The Champion continued publication from temporary quarters until a fast-working local contractor had the building repaired four months later. The community was doubling in population every 10 years. The opening of the Pomona Freeway brought new business. In 1972, the Chino Valley News was put out on Wednesday and sent to everybody. The paid-subscription Champion was moved to Friday. In 1978, the South Ontario News was started, and in 1980, a Sunday Champion was published, but it lasted only eight months. In 1988, the Chino Hills News was added, three years before the new city incorporated. The disappearance of the hometown weekly from the Southern California scene led the Champion to strengthen its position. On August 4, 1994, the Champion combined its paid and free newspapers into the once-a-week Chino and Chino Hills editions, distributed on Thursday to everybody. This delivery was changed to Saturday in 1999 to accommodate a new classified ad linkup with the Press Enterprise of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, which was now printing the Champion. In 2000, Bruce Wood, a former Champion general manager, returned as co-publisher. =21st Century= The prepress production of the Champion evolved in July 2004 when it converted to digital pagination. Over a period of several weeks, the Champion converted to digital output of pages using computers and new software and delivered them electronically to the printer with a high speed internet connection. Due to press capacity limitations, the printing of the Champion was switched from the Press-Enterprise to the San Bernardino Sun/USA Today printing facility in April 2005. This allowed for an increase in the use of full color photography in the presentation of news and advertising. Total circulation had reached nearly 42,800 homes by October 2006. On October 7, 2006, McCombs announced he had named his co-publisher, Bruce Wood, as publisher of Champion Newspapers. He would be stepping down as publisher after 50 years. He would remain active in the newspaper, however, as publisher emeritus and chairman of Champion Publications of Chino, Inc., the parent company. On July 7, 2012 the Champion returned to the Riverside Press- Enterprise to be printed after the latter worked at winning back the contract. A little over a year later in December 2014, the Champion switched to its current printer, The Desert Sun in Palm Springs. Total Champion circulation averaged slightly more than 41,000 by September 2015. ChampionNewspapers.com was upgraded again in June 2015 to include all content from the printed newspaper plus online only content, photo galleries, videos and comments from readers behind a metered ‚Äúpay wall‚Äù. William H. \\"Will\\" Fleet and business partner Ralph Alldredge purchased the Champion Newspapers on Feb. 1, 2017, after more than 60 years of ownership by Allen McCombs.

He was co-founder, president, and long-time executive director of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. Life Jƒôdrzejewicz, 1937 Jƒôdrzejewicz was born in Spiczy≈Ñce, Russian Empire (prior to 1795 in Poland) to Polish parents. As a student at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w (1913‚Äì14), Jƒôdrzejewicz joined J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Riflemen's Association (ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki). In 1915 he was one of the founders and leaders of the Polish Military Organisation (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa, or P.O.W.). In August 1915 he brought his \\"Warsaw Battalion\\" into the Polish Legions' First Brigade, then fighting in Volhynia. In July 1917, during the Legions' \\"Oath Crisis\\" (precipitated by a demand from Germany and Austro-Hungary that the Polish Legionnaires swear loyalty to them), Jƒôdrzejewicz was imprisoned by the Germans. When Poland regained independence in November 1918, Jƒôdrzejewicz began work at the Polish Army's Section II (Oddzia≈Ç II, or Intelligence). On 24 April 1920, Jƒôdrzejewicz, now a captain, signed a military convention with Ukraine's Ataman Semen Petlura which paved the way for the Polish Army's 1920 Kiev Expedition. Next he served as Section II chief successively to Generals Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Gustaw Zygad≈Çowicz. In September‚ÄìNovember 1920, as a major, he was the Polish Army's liaison officer to allied Belarusian forces. At the conclusion of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919‚Äì21, Jƒôdrzejewicz was a military expert with the Polish delegation at the Riga Peace Conference. In 1922‚Äì25 Jƒôdrzejewicz directed the Polish General Staff's \\"East\\" Department. In 1925 he was promoted to lieutenant- colonel. In 1925‚Äì28, he was military attach√© and effective charg√© d'affaires in Tokyo, Japan. Returning to Poland, he served as director of the Foreign Ministry's Consular Department (1928-1933) and as Treasury Vice Minister (1933-1934). On 22 January 1934, he was appointed Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education in the government of his brother, Premier Janusz Jƒôdrzejewicz (1885-1951), serving on as well in the premierships of Leon Koz≈Çowski and Walery S≈Çawek. He introduced educational reforms that sparked controversy in Poland but won international approval and emulation. After Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski died (1935), Jƒôdrzejewicz held no more ministerial offices. When World War II broke out in September 1939, Jƒôdrzejewicz helped evacuate the treasury of the Fund for National Defense, which in February 1940 was delivered to General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's Polish government-in-exile in Paris. Due to the anti-Pi≈Çsudskiite policies of General Sikorski (whose prewar career had been derailed by differences with Pi≈Çsudski), Jƒôdrzejewicz was prevented from serving now with the Polish Armed Forces in exile. Consequently, in March 1941 he emigrated to New York City. On 4 July 1943, Jƒôdrzejewicz co-founded the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America, dedicated to study of recent Polish history, and was its first director (5 July 1943 ‚Äî 28 September 1948). In 1948 Jƒôdrzejewicz became professor of Russian language and literature at Wellesley College. In 1958-1963 he was director of Slavic studies at Ripon College in Wisconsin. On retiring, he returned to New York, where in 1964 he again became director of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute. Jƒôdrzejewicz died at the age of 100 on 30 November 1993, in Cheshire, Connecticut, the last of Marshal Pi≈Çsudski's government ministers and the last co-founder of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. He was interred on 4 June 1994 at PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw, Poland. Works Jƒôdrzejewicz published some 300 scholarly papers in history and several major books, including Poland in the British Parliament, 1939-45 and a two-volume Kronika ≈ºycia J√≥zefa Pi≈Çsudskiego (Chronicle of the Life of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski). His English-language publications also included Pi≈Çsudski: a Life for Poland, New York, Hippocrene Books, 1982. Recognition Jƒôdrzejewicz was awarded the Silver Cross of Virtuti Militari (personally by Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, 11 November 1921), the Cross of Independence with Swords, the Cross of Valour (Krzy≈º Walecznych) four times and the Order of Polonia Restituta, Classes I (Grand Cross, 1993) and IV, and received decorations of 13 countries, including the French Legion of Honour.

He is the founder- president and editor of Rationalist International, the president of the Indian Rationalist Association and the author of 25 books and other articles. In 2012, he was charged by a group of Catholics with blasphemy when he insulted the Catholic faithful while examining a claimed \\"miracle\\" at a local church in Mumbai. He moved to Finland to evade arrest. Early life Edamaruku was born in 1955 in Thodupuzha, Kerala, India to Joseph Edamaruku, an Indian scholar and author, and Soley Edamaruku. Born in a Christian-Hindu mixed marriage, he was brought up without any specific religious influence. At his parent's insistence, he was the first student in India whose official school records listed \\"no religion\\". He became a rationalist-atheist activist at the age of 15, after seeing a neighbourhood athlete's death after her family refused medical treatment because they believed in faith healing. In 1977, he obtained a master's degree in Political Science from the University of Kerala. In 1980, he received his MPhil degree from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi at the School of International Studies. While writing his thesis towards his doctorate, he began working for the Afro-Asian Rural Reconstruction Organization. He gave up his job in 1982 to focus more on the Indian Rationalist Association and publishing his own works. He also has a diploma in journalism and appeared as a regular panelist in TV channels. Rationalist activism Edamaruku demonstrating the trick to \\"create\\" holy ash in a village in Uttar Pradesh state in India. Edamaruku has been active in the Indian Rationalist Association (IRA) from the age of 15. Before becoming the president in 2005, he served as the General Secretary beginning in 1983, and has been the editor of its publication Modern Freethinker. His many books and articles deal mainly with rationalistic thoughts and against superstition in India. His writings in Rationalist International are translated into English, French, German, Spanish, and Finnish. In February 2011, Edamaruku was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. (USA) and is an Honorary Associate of New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists and Rationalist Association of UK (formerly Rationalist Press Association). Edamaruku demonstrating a levitation trick. Edamaruku has carried out investigations and demonstrations that helped expose frauds, mystics and god men as well as conducting campaigns against superstition in Indian villages. He refers to this as \\"Rationalist Reality Theatre.\\" These investigations have attracted the attention of print and television media throughout Asia. The documentary film Guru Busters features Edamaruku and a team of rationalist campaigners on the road in Kerala giving public demonstrations of how to perform supposedly supernatural stunts. He has helped in building Indian Atheist Publishers, which is now Asia's largest free thought publishing house. He convened the three International Rationalist Conferences held in 1995, 2000 and 2002. In December 2013, Edamaruku announced the launch of a new quarterly English language magazine The Rationalist on his blog. Contributors will include international rationalists on several continents and content will focus on science, reason, critical thinking and human rights. =The Great Tantra Challenge= On 3 March 2008, while appearing on a panel TV show, Edamaruku challenged a tantrik to demonstrate his powers by killing him using only magic. The live show on India TV where the tantrik chanted mantras and performed a ceremony received a large boost in ratings. After his attempts failed, the tantrik reported that Edamaruku must be under the protection of a powerful god, to which Edamaruku responded that he is an atheist. 2012 blasphemy case In March 2012, Sanal Edamaruku investigated a report that a crucifix at Our Lady of Velankanni church in Mumbai was dripping water from the feet. This incident, though not claimed by the Catholic Church as a miracle, was believed by locals to be one. Research by Edamaruku indicated that the dripping was caused by capillary action from a clogged drain. Edamaruku mocked the Catholic Church, calling it \\"anti-science\\", and made fun of the Pope, during his appearance on a television show held to discuss the investigation. A Catholic lawyer asked Edamaruku to apologise whilst on television, but he did not, so in April 2012, the Catholic Secular Forum in Mumbai filed a complaint under Section 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code in several police stations around the city. The All India Catholic Union said the law was being applied incorrectly. Colin Gonsalves, the founder of the India Center for Human Rights and Law, stated his opinion that no criminal offence had been committed. There were further complaints that the law was being misused to suppress free speech. Others spoke in his defense publicly, such as Vishal Dadlani, and James Randi. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay issued statements that called for Edamaruku to apologise and for the prosecution to drop the charges, although the Catholic Church is not associated with the criminal charges. On 31 July 2012 Edamaruku moved to Finland. When fellow campaigner Narendra Dabholkar was murdered in 2013, Edamaruku felt returning could put his life in peril. Edamaruku said, \\"I would do it again. Because any miracle which has enormous clout at one moment, is simply gone once explained. It's like a bubble. You prick it and it is finished.\\" Views Sanal Edamaruku speaking at The Amaz!ng Meeting (TAM) 2013 on the topic \\"Indian Gurus: From Flying Fakirs and Starving Saints\\" Edamaruku has been critical of India's blasphemy laws, describing them as \\"relics of colonial legislation\\" which have been abused to \\"hound and silence\\" intellectuals and artists who question religious beliefs. He considers it dangerous that any person may register a complaint of blasphemy against another, leading to an arrest and prolonged imprisonment until the suspect is acquitted by a court of law. Edamaruku argues that the real danger here is less the verdict and more the pre-trial \\"punishment\\". Edamaruku has been a critic of Mother Teresa, publicly criticising her legacy in Kolkata. He has spoken out against the Catholic Church's sainthood of Mother Teresa and the 'miracle' cure of Monica Besra. The church's evidence is based on a written testimony in English by Besra, an illiterate woman who isn't able to speak the language, claiming a cure by a medallion placed on her by nuns. Edamaruku said that her cure could be reasonably ascribed to the treatment she received in a government hospital in Balurghat and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. After investigating her care record the former health minister of West Bengal, Partho De, has agreed her recovery was attributable to her months of medical care. Edamaruku describes the 'miracle' as an \\"obvious fraud.\\" Edamaruku frequently speaks of the potentially dangerous practice of superstitions, such as Hindu astrology, which is prevalent in Indian society. He is a regular commentator on Indian TV channels explaining superstitions and blind belief, and is a major voice in defense of reason and scientific temper in India. He has delivered lectures abroad including the US and many European countries. Godmen in India have often been accused of indulging in criminal activities under the guise of religion in order to procure followers, fame and funds. According to Edamaruku, most are charlatans, and quite a few have amassed great wealth and property from \\"miracles\\" that are nothing more than sleight of hand. Edamaruku considers the Indian rationalist movement an \\"inspiring example for many western rationalists to awaken, activate and rejuvenate their own organisations\\", with India's rationalists being \\"on the frontline of the battle between science and superstition\\". In popular culture *The Australian writer Greg Egan used the story of Edamaruku, the Indian Rationalist Association and the Tantra Challenge in his novel Teranesia. *Edamaruku appears as a character in Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen's novel French Lover. *Angela Saini's book Geek Nation: How Indian Science is Taking Over the World has a chapter \\"Chariot of Gods\\" that describes Edamaruku's work.

It generally refers to the period from the 13th to the 16th century . Most notated music consisted of the simultaneous flow of several different melodies, all independent and equally important, or polyphony. Usually made of four or five different choral parts, the music was originally for unaccompanied voices and was used mostly in the mass and motet of church music and the madrigal in secular music. Gothic period (1200‚Äì1550) First forms of polyphonic music are developed known as Ars Antiqua or Ancient art.

This report, called \\"Theoretical Possibilities and Consequences of Major Accidents in Large Nuclear Power Plants\\" (also known as \\"The Brookhaven Report\\"), estimated maximum possible damage from a meltdown with no containment building at a large nuclear reactor. The conclusions of this study estimated the possible effects of a \\"maximum credible accident\\" for nuclear reactors then envisioned as being 3400 deaths, 43,000 injuries and property damage of $7 billion ($57bn adjusted for inflation in 2012 since 1957). The estimate of probability was one in a hundred thousand to one in a billion per reactor-year. When WASH-740 was revised in 1964-65 to account for the larger reactors then being designed, the new figures indicated that there could be as many as 45,000 deaths, 100,000 injuries, and $17 billion in property damage ($125bn adjusted for inflation since 1964). However, the assumptions underlying the results were unrealistic (including the worst meteorological conditions, no containment building, and that half the reactor core is released into the atmosphere as micrometre-sized pellets without any examination of how this might occur). These were due to conservatism (estimating the maximum possible damage) and the need to use atomic bomb fallout data, which had been collected from tests (computers in 1955 being greatly insufficient to do the calculations). As knowledge, models and computers improved the conclusions of this report were replaced by those of first WASH-1400 (1975, The Rasmussen Report), then CRAC-II (1982), and most recently NUREG-1150 (1991). Now all of these studies are considered obsolete (see the disclaimer to NUREG-1150), and are being replaced by the State-of- the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA) study.

It is located in the Svaneti region of Georgia, just south of the border with the Kabardino-Balkaria region of Russia. Although it does not rank in the 10 highest peaks of the range, Ushba is known as the \\"Matterhorn of the Caucasus\\" for its picturesque, spire-shaped double summit. Due to its steep profile and unstable weather, Ushba is considered by many climbers as the most difficult ascent in the Caucasus. Geography Ushba's south summit is slightly higher than its north summit, which has an elevation of . The north summit was first climbed in 1888 by John Garford Cokklin and Ulrich Almer, while the south summit saw its first ascent in 1903 by a German-Swiss-Austrian expedition led by B. Rickmer-Rickmers. Ushba's north summit is more accessible than the south summit: the standard route, the Northeast Ridge, ascends from the Russian side of the range to a high plateau and thence to the summit. (Hence a summit ascent on this route technically involves crossing the border.) The route is graded French AD+ or Russian 4a. Routes on the south summit, from the Georgian side, include two routes graded French ED. Soviet Era Prior to the discovery in the late 1980s of the 4810m Peak 4810 in Karavshin, Ushba, together with Chatyn-Tau and Free Korea Peak in Kyrgyzstan, were considered some of the most difficult and prestigious peaks to climb in the former Soviet Union.http://www.stolby.ru/Mat/Stolbist/29/10-11.asp Recent History In August 2012, thunderstorms made the ascent of Ushba treacherous. One climber died and another, Andranik Miribyan, was stuck near the summit for four days after becoming trapped on a ledge by heavy snowfall. Due to high winds, rescuers were unable to reach him by helicopter and Andranik made the decision to descend the mountain, despite having no ice axe after his broke while clearing snow. Russian tourists Victoria Bushuyeva, 30, and Andrey Sidorov, 36, have gone missing on the mountain Ushba in Mestia in September, 2013.https://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/10/lost In Popular Culture Russian folk-rock band \\"Melnitsa\\" has a song \\"Ushba\\" on their fourth album.

Stabilization is often performed by the first person to arrive on scene, EMTs, or nurses before or just after arrival in hospital. It includes controlling bleeding, arranging for proper evacuation, keeping patients warm with blankets, and calming them by providing personal attention and concern for their well-being. It is particularly important in trauma cases where spinal injury is suspected to immobilize the cervical spine, or back. Failure to do so can cause permanent paralysis or death. In the field, spinal stabilization involves moving the person's back as a single unit with as many as five rescuers assisting, then applying a cervical collar (which can be improvised from duct tape and cardboard), and securing victims to a solid-backed stretcher, long spine board, or a vacuum mattress. Search and rescue technicians trained in wilderness first aid have a protocol for verifying that the spine has not been hurt (clearing the cervical spine) when the victim is several hours or more from the hospital and evacuation may not be indicated. Without this technique, it may be necessary to carry a suspected trauma victim out only to discover that he had no injury worthy of the effort and expense.

After his training at the Art Center College of Design, Telnack began working as a designer for Ford in 1958, and became the head stylist of the Lincoln-Mercury Division in 1965. In 1966, he became the chief designer of Ford's Australian branch, where he led the redesign of the Ford Falcon, and served as the Vice President of Design for Ford of Europe in 1974. Telnack retired from his post at the end of 1997, and was replaced by J Mays. Telnack and his team of designers were responsible for ushering a new era of aerodynamic design to America's mainstream marketplace. Cars like the 1979 Ford Mustang (third generation), 1983 Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation), 1984 Ford Tempo and 1984 Continental Mark VII were moderate successes that showed Ford's intention to change their traditional design language for a more contemporary, European style.

He started in the first round of the playoffs, a 27-10 loss against the Oakland Raiders, after throwing for 281 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions. Sipe won back the starting job the next season. In 1984, the Browns did not re-sign Sipe and gave the starting job to McDonald, who had a 5-11 record after enduring 53 sacks and registering 3,472 passing yards, 14 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. Against the New England Patriots, he had a career-high 320 passing yards on 23 out of 37 attempts (62.2%) and one touchdown.

He reunited with pass offense coordinator Paul Hackett who was one of his coaches with the Trojans and the Browns. Mcdonald also became the first left hander quarterback to make the team in franchise history. In 1987, he beat rookie Kevin Sweeney for the third-string quarterback job, leading the team with a 92.0 quarterback rating in pre-season. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Sweeney was signed to be a part of the Dallas Cowboys replacement team, had success and was kept on the roster for the rest of the year along with McDonald. On August 23, 1988, he was released without playing a down in his time with the team. Personal life McDonald does radio color commentary for USC Trojans football games and lives in Newport Beach, California. He won the award for being the best radio color analyst given yearly by the prestigious Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association.

The terminal was the fifth largest oil-products storage depot in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of about 60 million Imperial gallons (273 million litres) of fuel. The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco (40%). The first and largest explosion occurred at 06:01 UTC near tank 912, which led to further explosions which eventually overwhelmed 20 large storage tanks. The emergency services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a firefighting effort began. The cause of the explosion was a fuel-air explosion in a vapour cloud of evaporated leaking fuel. The British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale. News reports described the incident as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe and certainly the biggest such explosion in the United Kingdom since the 1974 Flixborough disaster. The flames had been extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one storage tank re-ignited that evening, which firefighters left to burn rather than attempting to extinguish it again. The Health Protection Agency and the Major Incident Investigation Board provided advice to prevent incidents such as these in the future. The primary need is for safety measures to be in place to prevent fuel escaping the tanks in which it is stored. Added safety measures are needed for when fuel does escape, mainly to prevent it forming a flammable vapour and stop pollutants from poisoning the environment.  Incident  = Explosion and fire = 3Com Corporation buildings. Note the broken windscreen and rear window on the vehicle in the foreground. The first and largest explosion occurred at 06:01 UTC on Sunday, 11 December 2005 near container 912. Further explosions followed which eventually overwhelmed 20 large storage tanks. From all accounts, it seems to have been an unconfined vapour cloud explosion of unusually high strengthalso known as a fuel-air explosion. Because of an inversion layer, the explosions were heard up to away; there were reports that they were audible in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands. The British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale. It was reported that people were woken in south London, and as far west as Wokingham (about ), where in its southern suburb, Finchampstead, numerous people felt the shockwave after the initial explosion. Subsequent explosions occurred at 06:27 and 06:28. Witnesses many miles from the terminal observed flames hundreds of feet high; the smoke cloud was visible from space, and from as far north as Lincolnshire (about ) away. Damage from the blasts included broken windows at various buildings including the Holy Trinity church and Leverstock Green School, blown-in or warped front doors, and an entire wall being removed from a warehouse more than half a mile (800 m) from the site. Buildings in neighbouring St Albans also suffered; Townsend School had serious blast damage, and a window was blown out of St Albans Abbey (about away). Several nearby office blocks were hit so badly that almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the explosion ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof of at least one house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, not only because of the smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable. There were 43 reported injuries; two people were deemed to be seriously injured enough to be kept in hospital, one in Watford General Hospital, with breathing difficulties, and another in Hemel Hempstead Hospital, although they were not in a life-threatening condition. Some early media reports spoke of eight fatalities, but these may have been persons missing. All members of staff from the terminal were accounted for. Hertfordshire police and fire services and the member of parliament for the area, Mike Penning, said that there were seven fuel tanks on the site which, as of 14:00 on 12 December, had not been affected. These tanks were at risk of exploding if the fire were to spread. = Tackling the blaze = This satellite photo shows black smoke from the explosion spreading in two main streams from the explosion site shown by the orange dot. By the time the fire had been extinguished the smoke had reached the English Channel. The emergency services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a tremendous firefighting effort began. At peak times this effort consisted of 25 fire engines, 20 support vehicles and 180 fire fighters. Around 150 firefighters were called immediately to the incident, and began tackling the blaze at 08:20 on the morning of 11 December, putting in containment measures before applying a large quantity of foam. The incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway, which led to its closure and the setting up of a public exclusion area. It was estimated that this incident would be the largest \\"single-seat\\" fire in the world ever to be fought by a fire brigade, and foam supplies from sites all over the UK were drawn upon. Plans had been in place to start using foam at midnight on 11 December, but were delayed by last-minute concerns over possible pollution of local rivers and underlying water sources. Six high volume pumps were used to extract of water per minute per secondfrom a reservoir from the fire, with six more high-volume pumps deployed at various locations to serve as boosters. Thirty-two thousand litres (7,039 imp gal) of fire fighting foam per minute were directed against the fire for just over four hours, after which the pumping rate was reduced. Half of the 20 individual fires were reported extinguished by midday. By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was reported that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed. Firefighting operations were resumed at about 20:00, and it was anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred to one of the storage tanks in the early hours of Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping. Firefighters were confident that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the day on Tuesday, 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16 other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies as well as all the emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, some distance from the fire. A further fire broke out during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that extinguishing it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so it would be better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire. = Smoke cloud = The smoke plume seen from Dunsmore, Buckinghamshire, about 14 miles (23 km) away, 2 hours after the explosion The black smoke cloud, which was visible from satellite photographs, drifted at a high altitude, around , towards Reading and Swindon, and could be seen across much of South East England. The small particles in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued warnings that the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December. The fire resulted in 244 people requiring medical aidmainly on the first day of the fire. From those 117 had symptoms attributable to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory complaints, of which half were sore throats. The smoke plume seen from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, about 18 miles (29 km) away, nearly 38 hours after the explosion For the first two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, together with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground- level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend. To investigate the smoke cloud the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements, a research aircraft operated jointly by NERC and the Met Office, made two flights on 12 and 13 December. In the first flight the edge of the plume was followed along the south coast of England. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone concentrations were found to be low with soot particles being the major component in the cloud. The second flight went into the centre of the plume to obtain data to help forecasting and emergency teams. Oil depot explosionupdate. Retrieved 2005-12-14.  Reactions and response  = Evacuations and closures = Smoke from the blast, visible from Hemel Hempstead, above the closed M1 motorway on the day of the explosion Hundreds of homes in the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated, and about 2,000 people had to find alternative accommodation; emergency services asked residents of the smoke-affected areas to close their windows and doors and to stay inside. Hertfordshire Constabulary advised people who had houses with smashed windows to seek refuge with friends or family nearby if possible. Some people whose homes were damaged by the blast were placed in hotels, while others stayed in a nearby shopping centre. Total, the operator of the Buncefield depot, set up a helpline for people whose properties had been damaged by the explosion, and called in local authorities and the Salvation Army to provide accommodation or other help. Concerns for public safety resulted in about 227 schools, libraries, and other public buildings across Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire closing on 12 and 13 December. Police and local authorities advised residents to consult the Hertfordshire Direct website for up-to-date information. Seventy-eight schools in Luton borough were closed on 13 December, along with a limited number of schools in Bedfordshire, on the advice of Hertfordshire's Health Protection Agency that all schools within a radius of the incident site should be closed because of concerns surrounding the effect of the smoke plume on children's health. Schools reopened as normal on 14 December. = Transport disruption = The incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway. The motorway was shut between junctions 12 and 6aabout shortly after the incident. Other roads in the vicinity, including the short M10 motorway (now part of the A414 road), were also closed. Some local petrol stations reported long queues as people started panic buying. A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry gave assurances that no petrol shortage was likely to result from the incident. The oil terminal supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, and because of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion. = Business disruption = In the Maylands industrial area the worst affected buildings were the Northgate Information Solutions headquarters and the Fujifilm building. These buildings were so badly damaged they were rendered completely unusable. Demolition of the Fujifilm building began soon afterwards, and by June 2006 it had been completely removed from the site. Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), 3Com Corporation and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged. In all, six buildings were designated for demolition and 30 more required major repairs before they could be reoccupied. As a result of the destruction of the equipment in the Northgate building several websites hosted there were inaccessibleincluding that of the Labour Party. Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge was also affected; its IT system dealing with admissions and discharges had to be replaced for several days by a manual system. A number of companies were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot. = Groundwater pollution = In May 2006 Three Valleys Water announced that it had detected the persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic fluorosurfactant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)which is used in fire fighting foamin a ground water bore hole close to the Buncefield site. It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had been about to ban its use. However just before the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate announced that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.  Inquiry  Smoke from the fire over Hampstead Heath, London, about 18 miles (29 km) away, 10 hours after the explosion A government inquiry held jointly by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, so as not to prejudice further legal proceedings. An initial progress report by the Major Incident Investigation Board on 21 February 2006 did not go into the causes of the explosion, but summed up the event and the immediate reaction from the emergency services. A second progress report, published on 11 April 2006, looked at the environmental impact. A further announcement was made on 9 May 2006 about the sequence of events which caused the explosion. Starting at 19:00 on the evening of 10 December 2005, Tank 912, towards the north west of the main depot, was filled with unleaded petrolfrom the Coryton Refinery located in Essex, England. At midnight the terminal closed, and a check was made of the contents of tanks, which found everything normal. Normally the gauges monitor the level of the fuel in the tank as it fills from the particular pipeline. From about 03:00 the level gauge for Tank 912 began to indicate an unchanging level reading, despite it being filled at per hour. Calculations show that the tank would have begun to overflow at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated of petrol would have spilled down the side of the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks. An overflow such as this results in the rapid formation of a rich fuel and air vapour. CCTV footage showed such a vapour flowing out the bund wall from around 05:38. By 05:50 the vapour started flowing off the site, near the junction of Cherry Tree and Buncefield Lane. Around 05:50 the rate at which fuel was being pumped into the tank increased dramatically. Initially the fuel was pumped in at per hour, but it increased to about per hour. By 06:01, when the first explosion occurred, the cloud which was initially about deep, thickened to and had spread beyond the boundaries of the site. The extent of the damage meant it was not possible to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.  Legal action  = Civil liability = The Buncefield depot is behind the Northgate building (at the right of this photo). The building lost the glass from all of its windows. A total of 2,700 claims were filed by residents, businesses and insurers. A group of 146 claimants were hoping to bring a class action against Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd. On 17 March 2006 a High Court official, Senior Master Turner, adjourned a hearing on whether to permit the class action until October 2006. Claimants including insurance companies, small businesses and about 280 families whose properties were damaged or destroyed were claiming up to ¬£1 billion in damages. Several court cases resulted from the explosion, although the main trial to determine who was liable for the damage commenced at the High Court in October 2008. The BBC quoted Cheetah Courierswhich suffered a 20% drop in turnover because of the explosions, resulting in losses of around ¬£300,000 to ¬£400,000. The company was located in offices on an industrial estate from the depot. An initial trial concluded on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel issued a summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK claimed that the duty supervisor at the time was responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around ¬£700 million. Total appealed the judgement, but the appeal was dismissed in a hearing on 4 March 2010.[\\"Herbert Smith achieves appeal victory for Chevron\\", http://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/news/news20100304-hs-achieves-appeal- victory-for-chevron], Herbert Smith Freehills, accessed 2015-03-11 = Criminal liability = The site is covered by the COMAH regulations. The Control of Major Accidents and Hazards Regulations are jointly enforced by the \\"competent authority\\" which is formed of the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. They carried out an investigation during and following the fire. In April 2010 the five companies accused of causing the explosion faced a criminal prosecution brought by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. Two defendants, Total UK and British Pipeline Agency Limited, had already pleaded guilty to offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The remaining three, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty in June 2010. TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty of failing to protect their employees. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd was found guilty of failing to prevent major accidents and limit their effects and then pleaded guilty to causing pollution to enter controlled waters underlying the vicinity around the site, contrary to the Water Resources Act. Sentencing took place in July 2010. Total UK was fined ¬£3.6m, plus ¬£2.6m in costs. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Limited was fined ¬£1.45m and ¬£1m in costs. The British Pipeline Agency was fined ¬£300,000 plus ¬£480,000 costs. Motherwell Control Systems and TAV Engineering were fined ¬£1,000 each. Local MP Mike Penning called the modest fines \\"insulting\\".  The terminal  The Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal (HOSLHertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd), generally known as the Buncefield complex, was the fifth largest oil-products storage depot in the UK, with a capacity of about of fuel, although it was not always full. This was about 8% of UK oil storage capacity. The HOSL is a major hub on the UK's oil pipeline network (UKOP) with pipelines to Humberside and Stanlow Refinery and is an important fuel source to the British aviation industry, providing aircraft fuel for local airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports. About half of the complex is dedicated to the storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, petrol and diesel fuel for petrol stations across much of the South-East of England. The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco 40%. The seat of the fire, and the worst damaged section, was \\"HOSL West\\", used by Total and Texaco to store a variety of fuels, and the neighbouring British Pipeline Agency area.  Causes  The smoke plume from 3.75 miles (6 km) away, the day after the explosion The final report of the Major Incident Investigation Board (MIIB) was written in 2008 and released in February 2011.Official accident report from MIIB The investigation found that Tank 912 at the Buncefield oil storage depot was being filled with petrol. The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being \\"filled blind\\" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days. The investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained. Wider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety. Aftermath Soon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.  Remembrance  An anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast. = Reconstruction = To rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site is a good way from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.  Extinction Rebellion blockade  On 28 August 2020, Extinction Rebellion blocked access to the rebuilt Buncefield site for six hours. Six climate activists were \\"locked on\\" to two vehicles, and a further twenty activists held placards and banners. The activists stated that the action was intended to draw attention to the role of fossil fuels, such as those stored at Buncefield, in driving the climate emergency.

During this closure the school was made into a hospital for union soldiers during the American Civil War .The school was the first FM high school radio station (88.1) to be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and has had its own Public-access television cable TV channel WNAS-TV since 1980. It is a part of the New Albany-Floyd County Consolidated School Corporation. The school serves New Albany and surrounding unincorporated areas.New Albany High School District (Archive). New Albany-Floyd County Consolidated School Corporation. Retrieved on April 9, 2015. History Established as Scribner High School in 1853, it was originally located on West Fourth and Spring Street. After one year after its opening, the school was temporarily closed by the Indiana Supreme Court after the court ruled that its administration was allocating funds unlawfully. It was reopened until it was again closed in 1859, when the United States Army converted the school into a hospital for soldiers serving in the American Civil War. Prior to the Conclusion of the American Civil War, Scribner High School reopened for academic usage; enrolling students in September 1864. In 1870, the high school established two separate high schools; with the original building being converted into an All Boys' High School, while a secondary building on Spring Street and Bank Street was designated as the Female High School. In 1880, the schools were consolidated; with all students beginning attendance solely at the former Female High School. In 1902, the site at Bank Street and Spring Street was torn down for the construction of the Carnegie Library Building. From 1902 to 1903, the High School temporarily held classes at the Frisbee House on East Sixth and Spring Street. It temporarily relocated once again at the end of academic sessions in 1903, where the school moved to the DePauw college building at East Main and Ninth Street. In 1905, relocation of the high school ceased with the completion of a new building on East Sixth and Spring Street. In 1927, the current building located on Vincennes Street was constructed; with classes relocating once again. Additions to the building in 1942 allowed for increased space for administrative usage; alongside with facilities to host the countries first high school radio program. Several additions continued, with a student theater being added in 1978, a new library, swimming pool and laboratories between the years of 1979 and 1982. In 1998, renovations began on the school, bringing additions such as its current athletic offices, clinic, bookstore, cafeteria, kitchen area, auditorium and auxiliary gym.

The conflict was fought as a part of the Russian Civil War and lasted with varying success from July 1918 to May 1919, and ended through British mediation establishing the current official border between Russia and Georgia. Background Georgian claims came from the fact that the area was politically dominated by the medieval Kingdom of Georgia at the height of its prestige and strength, and then came under the rule of a successor, the Kingdom of Imereti and, eventually, the Principality of Abkhazia. The area of increasing tourist interest, part of this region was detached by the Tsar's decree of December 25, 1904, from the Sukhumi district (Kutais Governorate) to become part of the Black Sea Governorate. The region was inhabited by a significant number of Armenians and Georgians. The Russian general Anton Denikin and his colleagues insisted, however, that the border between Georgia (though not yet recognized by either White or Soviet leadership) and the White-controlled Kuban People's Republic should be that between the former Russian governorates of Kutais and Black Sea, i.e. slightly in the north to the Bzyb River. Conflict The conflict was preceded by a pro-Bolshevik revolt in Abkhazia that made the local post-revolution government, Abkhaz People's Council, to request aid from the Democratic Republic of Georgia and to join it as an autonomous entity (June 8, 1918). A Georgian force under Major General Giorgi Mazniashvili was deployed in the region and joined by an Abkhaz cavalry provided by local nobility. Mazniashvili repulsed a Bolshevik offensive from Sochi direction late in June and, following to the instructions from Abkhaz and Georgian authorities, advanced northward in order to liquidate a Bolshevik base which provided help to the Communist soldiers. The Georgian military operation, encouraged also by a German military mission, resulted in the occupation of Adler (3 July), Sochi (6 July), and Tuapse (27 July) along the Black Sea coastline. Mazniashvili was soon ordered to take control of the Tuapse-Maykop railway line and coordinate his actions with the White Russian Kuban government and Denikin's Volunteer Army waging an all-out war against the Red armies in South Russia. People of Sochi greets Georgian army, July 1918. Initially, Georgia regarded the White forces as allies against the common threats from the Bolshevist Moscow. This cooperation was, however, soon clouded by Denikin's calls for the reunited \\"Great Russia\\" with the Caucasus as its integral part. Early in September, the Georgians were forced out from Tuapse by the retreating Red Taman Army, under command of Yepifan Kovtyukh and pursued by Denikin's forces. Soon the White units took control of the town on September 8 forcing the Bolsheviks to retreat further toward Armavir. On September 18, a Council for Sochi (a legislature formed by the local Mensheviks and SRs in August) declared the unification of the city and its district to the Democratic Republic of Georgia as a \\"temporary measure\\" against the threats from both Lenin and Denikin. The annexation by Georgia followed immediately and caused an acute protest from the leaders of the White forces. On September 25, 1918, the White leaders and representatives of the DRG met in Ekaterinodar to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. Denikin demanded that the Georgians withdraw back to the Bzyb river. An agreement was not achieved and the Whites halted the negotiations next day. The same day Denikin captured Lazarevskaya at the northern outskirts of Sochi but he was unable to take full control over the region until the Red Army was defeated in North Caucasus. On February 6, 1919 the Georgian troops were forced back to the Bzyb river with their commander General Konyev (Koniashvili), and his staff captured by the Russians at Gagra. Georgia sent reinforcements, but the British representatives intervened establishing a demarcation line along the Bzyb. The captured Georgian officers were released. 234x234pxOn March 14, 1919 a Georgian delegation presented at Paris peace conference a project of the borders of the country in which it demanded a part of the former Black Sea province up to the small river Makopse 14 km southeast to the town Tuapse. The negotiations, however, yielded no results. On April 12, 1919, a Sukhumi-based Georgian People's Guard and army units under General Mazniashvili launched a counteroffensive. Avoiding the British peacekeeping posts at the Bzyb river, they retook Gagra after a bloody clash and, in cooperation with the \\"Green\\" Russian guerillas, moved to the Mekhadiri river. The British intervention however halted the Georgian advance. A new demarcation line was established south to Adler, on the Psou River. Along the border, a British expeditionary force took positions to prevent further outbreak of the war. On May 23‚Äì24, Georgian, Russian Volunteers' and British representatives met in Tbilisi to find a peace resolution. Actually, this was the end of the conflict. Occasional skirmishes occurred, however, until the late 1919. The establishment of the current official Russian-Georgian border along the Psou was perhaps the main outcome of the Sochi conflict. The new border was de jure recognized by the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (May 1920) and the Allies (January 1921).

Starring Steven Seagal, the film is loosely based on the novel The Last Canadian by William C. Heine. Seagal's first direct-to-video film, it features him as a local doctor and former immunologist who races against time to find a cure for an active viral outbreak, the origins of which trace back to a militia leader who injected himself with a deadly virus. The film was released worldwide on 10 July 1998 and in USA on 6 February 1999. Plot Near the town of Ennis, Montana, local doctor and former government research immunologist Wesley McClaren (Steven Seagal) who has an interest in herbal medicine and is also a weapons and self-defense expert, is called to a hospital when people start dying from an unknown but very deadly disease. He determines that the cause is a highly dangerous airborne virus and calls in a Biological Response team, who seal off the town while doctors start treating sufferers with a vaccine. Unfortunately for them, several have already died. The source of the virus is traced to a local self-styled rebel militia leader, Floyd Chisholm (Gailard Sartain), who has given himself up after a long siege and has been arrested on weapons charges. In court, having ingested the virus himself (believing that he also possesses the vaccine) he spits at the judge, and starts the rapid spread of the disease. Floyd's militia followers, who have been allowed to go free, attack the prison and rescue Floyd. They then proceed to invade and besiege the hospital, with much loss of life, and take medical personnel hostage including Wesley and his daughter Holly (Camilla Belle). But too late, they realize that the vaccine they were seeking at the hospital is the same as the one they possess which only delays the effect of the deadly virus. Working at gunpoint, Wesley takes a sample of Holly's blood; it shows that Holly has been infected, but somehow her body is fighting it off. Wesley and Holly contrive to escape and travel to a farm where Holly's grandfather lives. Wesley takes a blood sample from his friend Dr. Ann White Cloud (Whitney Yellow Robe), and realizes that her body is also fighting off the infection. Wesley and Ann gain access to a secret underground laboratory where Wesley used to work, where they hope to come up with a cure. Wesley finds out why Ann and Holly are not being affected by the virus: they have been drinking tea made with a specific wild herb that is known to Native American healers. Back at the hospital, Wesley and Holly are captured by the militia, but he manages to kill Floyd and disable the other soldiers. As soon as the biological protection team learn of the cure, they go out and pick all the flowers they can find and drop them by helicopter over the town, telling the people to boil them and drink the liquid.

ATF Agent #3 Production The film, directed by academy-award-winning cinematographer Dean Semler, was reportedly originally intended as a theatrical release, but was ultimately released direct-to-video, the first Seagal film to skip theaters entirely. It was shot over eight weeks in Ennis and Virginia City, Montana, and for three days on the campus of Montana State University. Filming was briefly halted to remove snow from the ground during shooting in Virginia City, to maintain continuity. The screenplay is credited to M. Sussman and John Kingswell (neither has any other film credit of any kind). Several writers, including David Ayer and Paul Mones were rumored to be working on the script prior to its release; Mones was ultimately credited as a producer. Though the movie is credited as an adaptation of William C. Heine's novel The Last Canadian, it shares virtually no similarities with the novel except the idea of a deadly virus. No character names, events, or even locations appear in both the book and the film. The film is Seagal's only effort to date in which he co-stars with his daughter, actress Ayako Fujitani, and is notable for an extremely low amount of action scenes compared to Seagal's other work. Reception The film has received generally negative reviews. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews called it \\"dull\\" and criticized its lack of action (he claims, \\"Out of a 90 minute movie, there's maybe 10 minutes of actual Seagal hand-to-hand combat\\") and unwelcome political messages. Seagalogy author Vern argues that \\"in many ways The Patriot is an admirable effort,\\" noting \\"The production values and acting are better than some of Seagal's subsequent movies,\\" but going on to point out that due to its \\"ridiculously low action quotient it is a least-favorite of many Seagal fans.\\" As of 2 October 2014, the film has a 22% \\"rotten\\" critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 9 reviews).

Originally raised in 1921 as the 2nd Cavalry Division, based in Victoria and South Australia, the formation had been converted into a motor division in early 1942, before adopting the armoured designation later in the year. A Militia formation, the division undertook garrison duties in Australia and did not see combat before being disbanded in mid-1943. History The division was established in 1921 as the 2nd Cavalry Division, which was formed as part of the Militia when Australia's part time military force was re-established following the demobilisation of its wartime forces. Based in Victoria and South Australia, the division consisted of the 3rd, 5th and 6th Cavalry Brigades. The 5th Cavalry Brigade was disbanded during the interwar years, and by the outbreak of the war, the divisional headquarters was located in south Geelong. Tasked with the defence of the western approaches to Melbourne in the event of an invasion, the division was called up for full time service in December 1941, following Japan's entry into the war. Its constituent units ‚Äì the 4th and 20th Motor Regiments‚Äì were spread out between Stoneyford and Torquay and were organised into two ad hoc formations: Torquay Force and Corangmite Force. At the same time, the 3rd Cavalry Brigade was in reserve around Geelong. In early 1942, the 4th Infantry Division took over the forward defensive role, and the 2nd Cavalry Division became the commander's reserve, with its main elements concentrating around Lysterfield. In March 1942, the division was redesignated as the 2nd Motor Division, with its headquarters based at Oakleigh, and support troops at Gherang. The 6th Motor Brigade (previously the 6th Cavalry Brigade) moved from Adelaide in May and came under the division's command again, based around Geelong, until June when they were reorganised as the 6th Armoured Brigade, taking personnel and equipment from the 5th Motor Brigade. While the 3rd Motor Brigade moved to Rowville, the 6th Armoured Brigade was sent to Puckapunyal in July for training and the division headquarters moved to Rokeby in August, around which time it was re-designated as the 2nd Armoured Division. 2nd Armoured Division officers at Puckapunyal As an armoured division, it consisted of one armoured brigade of three armoured regiments, and one motor brigade consisting of three motor regiments, supported by an armoured car regiment. Its armoured regiments were equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. A major restructure of the Army's armoured formations occurred in October 1942, at which time the 3rd Motor Brigade was re-assigned to the 1st Armoured Division, and sent to Western Australia for garrison duties, while several motor brigades from the 1st were sent to Gherang to become part of the 2nd Armoured Division. In mid-February 1943, while around Rokeby, the division reported its strength as 466 officers and 7,315 other ranks, which was the division's peak strength before it began disbanding. As the threat of invasion passed, and the focus of the Army's attention turned to jungle warfare, the role of the Army's three armoured divisions diminished throughout 1943. By this time, there was a manpower shortage, which required a re-allocation of personnel and the gradual reduction of Australia's armoured units. As a result, the 2nd Armoured Division began the process of disbanding on 19 February 1943, although this was not completed until late May / early April when its headquarters was finally closed at Seymour and its staff marched out to join other units. The headquarters of its 6th Armoured Brigade was retained and redesignated as the headquarters of the 4th Armoured Brigade, moving to Singleton to begin preparing troops for deployment to New Guinea where they would join the fighting against the Japanese. The 2nd Armoured Division was commanded by Major General William Locke throughout its brief existence.

The expanded site was opened in 1968 after a pipeline was constructed to link two Shell refineries in Stanlow in the North West of England at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, and Shell Haven on the Thames Estuary at Stanford-le-Hope in Thurrock. The pipeline allowed \\"white oil\\" products, such as petrol and diesel, to be transported cheaply and efficiently across the country. Along with Buncefield, a number of other pipeline-fed installations were built at the same time. These depots were always shared by the oil companies who have benefited together from the lower costs compared with other transportation methods. However, when they opened, such depots, including Buncefield, sometimes became difficult to manage from an industrial relations perspective. Drivers and other operatives from different oil companies, but members of the same Trades Union, usually the Transport and General Workers Union, were able to coordinate their industrial action more effectively by being on the same site as one another. In 1990 a further pipeline was completed, linking the site to the Lindsey Oil Refinery in Humberside. Before the fire, which devastated over a quarter of the site, the terminal was the fifth largest oil depot in the UK with pipelines to Humberside, Merseyside and Heathrow and Gatwick airports radiating from it. The terminal operator is Total, which owns 60% of the depot, with Texaco owning the remaining 40%, though BP and Shell also make use of its facilities. As the fifth largest oil depot in the UK, it had a capacity of approximately 60 million Imperial gallons (273 million litres) of fuel, although it was not always at capacity. It previously filled 400 tanker lorries every day and handled around 2.37 million tonnes of oil products every year. In March 2008 BP announced it will soon be restarting some operations at the site with the storage and supply of aviation fuel to Heathrow. BP must comply with more than 50 safety conditions including refurbished tanks and an improved alarm system. The site consists of a northern and a southern portion, with the southern being used by BP and the northern portion being divided into 3 sectors; HOSL West, the BPA area, and HOSL East. Texaco, Total and Shell use HOSL West and HOSL East, while the BPA area is occupied by facilities of the British Pipeline Agency (BPA), mostly for aviation fuel. HOSL West was the main site in the northern portion of HOSL, and was used for storage of a variety of fuels excluding aviation fuel and kerosene, which are stored at BPA. The fire destroyed most of HOSL West and the BPA area.

It is the 5th largest sovereign wealth fund in the world with assets exceeding $592 billion. It is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and has signed up to the Santiago Principles on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds. History and profile KIA was founded on 23 February 1953 to manage the funds of the Kuwaiti Government in light of financial surpluses after the discovery of oil. KIA is the world's first and oldest sovereign wealth fund. KIA manages the Kuwait General Reserve Fund, the Kuwait Future Generations Fund, as well as any other assets committed by the Ministry of Finance. To put KIA's size into perspective, the Kuwait Future Generations Fund has 15% of annual oil revenues added to it. KIA's board of directors is headed by the minister of finance with other seats allocated to the Energy Minister, Governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, and 5 other nationals who are experts in the field, 3 of which should not hold any other public office. KIA is estimated to have more than $592 billion in assets, and is one of the largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the world. The Chinese regulator awarded Kuwait Investment Authority an additional $700 million quota on top of $300 million awarded in March 2012. The quota is the highest to be granted by China to foreign investment entities. The Kuwait Investment Authority has an infrastructure arm and signed an agreement to acquire the oil and gas pipeline firm North Sea Midstream Partners Limited for approximately 1.3 billion GBP in 2018. Grupo Torras In 1986, the KIA's London based subsidiary, the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), bought control of Torras Hostench, a Spanish paper maker. Torras subsequently took over a number of other companies to become Grupo Torras in June 1988. KIO invested about $2.5 billion in building up the company and another $1.8 billion to shore it up after the end of Spain's 1980s economic boom and the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq. However, in December 1992 Grupo Torras entered receivership among accusations of fraud, and Kuwait's investment was a total loss. One of its projects was the Gate of Europe twin towers in Madrid, which was still incomplete when the company collapsed.

The engine was a development of the Triumph slant-four engine. It consisted of a cast iron block and aluminium cylinder heads with a single overhead cam per bank. Development The Stag was developed between 1964 and 1969. Whilst originally seen as little more than a convertible version of the Triumph 2000 saloon, as development progressed the Stag gained its own identity until the final design shared no body panels or pressings with the 2000. The Stag was intended to use Triumph's existing 2.5-litre straight-6 engine. When the Stag design evolved into a grand tourer rather than a more conventional sports car it became clear that a more powerful, more refined engine was needed. As far back as 1963 the designer of the Triumph Slant-4 engine, Lewis Dawtrey, had foreseen the possibility that the engine design could be 'doubled-up' to create a V8 unit. This was not a unique approach; Vauxhall had followed a similar strategy, designing its own slant-4 so that two could be joined to make a V8 (which, ultimately, Vauxhall did not pursue). Whilst at this point the engine had only been produced in 1.7-litre form by Triumph for sale to Saab, the basic design of the engine enabled capacities as low as 1.2-litres to be built. Triumph revived the V8 concept, initially settling on a 2.5-litre engine (in essence two 1.2-litre versions of the slant-4) with mechanical fuel injection provided by Bosch. Following the take-over of Triumph by Leyland Motors in 1967 Spen King was placed in charge of product development at Triumph. The V8's Bosch fuel injection was running into numerous difficulties in development and King was unable to convince Leyland to divert extra funds to Triumph to solve the problems. Instead, King dropped the fuel injection in favour of twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. To maintain the required power output the capacity was increased to 3-litres, which then entailed modification to the Stag's other drivetrain systems including the gearbox, back axle and brakes. This relatively 'last-minute' capacity increase was achieved by expanding the bore of the engine instead of the stroke, which explains the Triumph V8's unusual 'oversquare' internal dimensions. Design As launched in 1970 the Triumph V8 had several innovative features. As well as its unusual construction (the crankcase and cylinder block were made from chromium iron whilst the cylinder heads were aluminium alloy), the engine featured a unique arrangement of studs and bolts attaching the cylinderheads that allowed the cylinderheads to be removed (in design, not in reality) without firstly removing the overhead camshafts and disturbing the valveplay adjustment. The water pump, oil pump and distributor were all driven at their required speeds from a single jackshaft driven from the timing chain via sets of skew-cut gears. The cooling fan was a 16-blade plastic item driven through a hydraulic viscous coupling that limited fan speed to 2,500 rpm to reduce noise as well as controlling the fan speed in relation to engine temperature. Potential other uses Triumph originally intended their V8 to be used across their range, which was the reason for the company's willingness to fund the engine's high development costs. Plans were made to create a 'Triumph 3000' by fitting the engine into the 2000 saloon, but these plans were halted when Rover joined Triumph in the Leyland grouping as the resulting car would have been a direct competitor for the Rover 'P6' 3500. Triumph also tried to sell the engine to the Morgan Motor Company but that company chose the Rover V8 as well. Saab tested the V8 in the Saab 99 mainly for US markets but the oil crisis in 1973 finally caused cancellation of the project in favour of turbocharging. The result was the V8 remained unique to the Stag. See also *Triumph Motor Company *Triumph Slant-4 engine References * Observer's Book of Automobiles P.

Originally raised in 1921 as the 1st Cavalry Division, the formation had been converted into a motor division in early 1942, before adopting the armoured designation in November 1942. A Militia formation, the division undertook garrison duties in New South Wales and then Queensland and did not see combat before being disbanded in late 1943 and early 1944. History The 3rd Armoured Division was first raised as the 1st Cavalry Division. In 1921, following the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) that had been raised during World War I, Australia's part time military force, the Citizens Force, was reorganised to perpetuate the AIF's numerical designations. At this time, the 1st Cavalry Division was raised alongside a second cavalry division and four infantry divisions. At this time, the 1st Cavalry Division consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Cavalry Brigades. The 1st was based in Queensland, while the other two were formed in New South Wales. The division's headquarters was in New South Wales. At the outbreak of the war, the 1st Cavalry Division was allocated to the defence of coastal New South Wales. As part of defensive measures, the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions were tasked with defending Newcastle and Sydney, while the 1st Cavalry Division assumed the role of command reserve, based around Narellan. In April 1941, the division was reorganised to cover the northern and southern approaches to Sydney. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the Militia was called up for full time service, and the divisional headquarters was established at Richmond. In the south, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was located at Armidale, covering the area between Armidale, Coffs Harbour and Rutherford, while the 4th Cavalry Brigade was located at Berrima covering Dapto, Nowra and Goulburn. The 2nd Cavalry Brigade's headquarters moved to Gloucester in February 1942, assuming responsibility for the defence of Stroud and Dungog as well as Coffs Harbour and Armidale. As the mechanisation process began, several light horse regiments converted into motor regiments, and the division was redesignated as the 1st Motor Division in March 1942, with its two cavalry brigades being converted to motor brigades. There were plans to raise a third brigade for the division at this stage, designated the 7th Motor Brigade, but this was not completed. M3 Grant tanks similar to those used by 2nd Armoured Brigade After divisional headquarters moved to Rutherford, the 12th and 15th Motor Regiments joined the division around Coffs Harbour and Grafton, while the 2nd Motor Brigade moved to Dungog, tasked with the defence of Newcastle. The following month, the division's support troops also moved to a concentration area west of Newcastle. The 2nd Infantry Division took over responsibility for the Newcastle area in May, after which the headquarters of the 4th Motor Brigade was converted into the 3rd Army Tank Brigade, while the 2nd Motor Brigade moved to Taree deploying units to Kempsey and Coffs Harbour. Several other motor regiments ‚Äì the 15th and 16th ‚Äì were transferred to other formations at this time, while others ‚Äì the 14th and 24th ‚Äì were disbanded. Another move occurred in July for the divisional headquarters when it was re-established at Wauchope. While there, a large-scale reorganisation of the Australian armoured units took place. This saw the creation of three armoured regiments. The 2nd Motor Brigade was transferred at this time to the 2nd Armoured Division, but gained the 2nd Armoured Brigade. In October, the divisional headquarters moved to Coffs Harbour. The division was redesignated as the 3rd Armoured Division on 15 November 1942, as the designation of the 1st Armoured Division had already been assigned to a Second Australian Imperial Force unit. As an armoured division the 3rd Armoured was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. These were assigned to the 2nd Armoured Brigade's three 2nd AIF armoured regiments: the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/9th. The division began moving to Murgon in Queensland in December 1942, after which they were assigned a mobile defensive role, which required further training. The division's 3rd Motor Brigade was gradually disbanded between March to August 1943 and the 3rd Armoured Division began disbanding at Murgon, in Queensland, on 19 October 1943 as a result of manpower shortages in the Australian Army and the changing strategic situation. This process was not completed until March 1944. Two armoured regiments that had previously been assigned to the 3rd Armoured Division ‚Äì the 2/4th and 2/9th ‚Äì went on to serve in combat with the 4th Armoured Brigade.

The breed was developed as dual-purpose, suitable for both dairy and beef production; however, certain blood lines within the breed always emphasised one quality or the other. Over time, these different lines diverged, and by the second half of the 20th century, two separate breeds had developed ‚Äì the Beef Shorthorn, and the Milking Shorthorn. All Shorthorn cattle are coloured red, white, or roan, although roan cattle are preferred by some, and completely white animals are not common. However, one type of Shorthorn has been bred to be consistently white ‚Äì the Whitebred Shorthorn, which was developed to cross with black Galloway cattle to produce a popular blue roan crossbreed, the Blue Grey. History The breed developed from Teeswater and Durham cattle found originally in the North East of England. In the late 18th century, the Colling brothers, Charles and Robert, started to improve the Durham cattle using the selective breeding techniques that Robert Bakewell had used successfully on Longhorn cattle. In 1796, Charles Colling of Ketton Hall, bred the famous Durham Ox.Friend, John B., Cattle of the World, Blandford Press, Dorset, 1978, The culmination of this breeding program was the birth of the bull Comet, bred by Charles Colling, in 1804. This bull was subsequently sold for 1,000 guineas in 1810 at the Brafferton sale, the first 1,000-guinea bull ever recorded. Related cattle may have been imported to the United States by Harry Dorsey Gough of Baltimore, Maryland, before 1808.Goff, Phillip. The Four Goff Brothers of West Virginia: A New Perspective on Their Lives, pp. 65 ff. Masthof (Morgantown), 2003. Accessed 20 October 2013. At the same time, Thomas Bates of Kirklevington and John Booth of Killesby were developing the Teeswater cattle. The Bates cattle were subsequently developed for their milking qualities, whereas the Booth cattle were developed for their beef qualities. Animals taken to Scotland in 1817 from the Booth herd were used to produce the Beef Shorthorn breed. In 1822, George Coates published the first volume of his herd book; this was the first pedigree herd book for cattle in the world.Beef Breeders' Annual, An Inverell Times supplement, Shorthorn breed arrived with the First Fleet, July 2008 Coates published the first four volumes, after which Henry Stafford took over the ownership and publishing of the herd book, retaining the name Coates's Herd Book. The Shorthorn Society of Great Britain and Ireland was founded in 1874, and purchased the copyright of the herd book from Stafford. They have continued to compile and publish Coates's Herd Book ever since. The American Shorthorn Herd Book was the first to be published in the United States for any breed and was started in 1846, with the formation of the American Shorthorn Association following 26 years later in 1872. Health Some Shorthorns have been found to have a genetic defect called tibial hemimelia (TH), a disease caused by an abnormal gene. TH was identified in a small number of Shorthorn cattle in Canada in 1999. It is characterised by severe deformities in newborn calves, which are born with twisted rear legs with missing tibias (shin bones) and fused joints, large abdominal hernias, and often skull deformities. They cannot stand to suckle and must be destroyed. All the affected animals descend from a single individual. The gene involved is recessive: the disease occurs only when homozygous (two copies of the gene are present); heterozygous (carrier) animals show no symptoms, but are likely to be much more widespread in the population than affected animals.Tibial Hemimelia, Meningocele, and Abdominal Hernia in Shorthorn Cattle, J. M. Lapointe, S. Lachance and D. J. Steffen, Veterinary Pathology 37: 508 ‚Äì 511, 2000 Retrieved on 10 November 2008 Distribution Shorthorn bull, cows & calves Today, the breed is found mainly in English-speaking countries, and Southern South America. The main countries are: Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, United Kingdom, the United States of America, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe. Beamish Museum in north-eastern England preserves the Durham breed. =Australia= Shorthorn cattle were one of the first purebred breeds to be imported into Australia when several cows were brought into New South Wales in 1800. More purebred Shorthorns were imported into NSW in 1825 by Potter McQueen of Scone. Nine months later, the Australian Agricultural Company imported additional Shorthorns, and in the 1930s, Thomas Simpson Hall, the breeder of the Halls Heeler, imported Durham Shorthorns from which he developed extensive herds of Poll Shorthorns. The breed has a wide genetic base, resulting in the development of several distinct though closely related strains ‚Äì these are the traditional strains: * Beef Shorthorn * Poll Shorthorn * Durham * Milking or Dairy Shorthorn * Australian Shorthorn The current Shorthorn Society of Australia encompasses the Poll Shorthorn, Australian Shorthorn, and Durham. Many other beef cattle breeds have used Shorthorn genetics in the development of new breeds such as the Belmont Red and Santa Gertrudis cattle.

It is an aggravated form of dangerous driving. It is currently created by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by the Road Traffic Act of 1991). Statute Section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 _Section 1 Road Traffic Act 1991_ ), creates the offences of causing death by dangerous driving: =\\"Dangerously\\"= See Dangerous driving#\\"Dangerously\\" Mode of trial Causing death by dangerous driving is an indictable-only offence. Sentencing A person convicted of causing death by dangerous driving is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, Part I of Schedule 2 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 285(3)) Disqualification for a minimum of two years is obligatory on conviction.The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, sections 34(1) and (4) and Part I of Schedule 2 Endorsement is obligatory on conviction.The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, section 44 and Part I of Schedule 2 The offence carries three to eleven penalty points (when the defendant is exceptionally not disqualified).The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988,section 28 and Part I of Schedule 2 The Court of Appeal in R v Cooksley and others _Cooksley & Anor v R [2003] EWCA Crim 996 (3 April 2003)_ gave guidelines for cases where death is caused by dangerous driving. In R v Richardson _Richardson & Ors, R v [2006] EWCA Crim 3186 (18 December 2006)_ the Court of Appeal reassessed the starting point set out in R v Cooksley taking into consideration the increase in the maximum penalty. The relevant starting points identified in Cooksley should be reassessed as follows: :i) No aggravating circumstances ‚Äì twelve months to two years' imprisonment (previously 18 months); :ii) Intermediate culpability ‚Äì two to four-and-a-half years' imprisonment (previously 3 years); :iii) Higher culpability ‚Äì four-and- a-half to seven years' imprisonment (previously 5 years); :iv) Most serious culpability ‚Äì seven to fourteen years' imprisonment (previous starting point of 6 years). When a court disqualifies a person on conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, it must order an extended retest. =History= Part I of Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 originally provided that a person convicted of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. It was amended by section 67(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on 16 August 1993England and Wales: S.I. 1993/1968, art. 2(1) & Sch.1; Scotland: S.I. 1993/2035, art. 2(1) so as to increase the maximum term to ten years. New offences The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced two new offences, of \\"causing death by careless, or inconsiderate driving\\" and a distinct offence for causing (any) death by driving when unlicensed, or disqualified. History This offence was formerly created by the Road Traffic Act 1956. But it was abolished by section 50 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. Equivalents in other countries =Australia (not including overseas dependencies)= In New South Wales and Western Australia, \\"Dangerous driving occasioning death\\" is an equivalent to \\"Causing death by dangerous driving\\". The person's driving privileges, in Western Australia, will be suspended for at least 2 years, from the date of conviction. Should any of the following \\"Circumstances of aggravation\\" be proven, in a trial for dangerous driving occasioning death, it is possible for the driver to receive a prison sentence of up to and including 20 years: *driver was unlawfully driving the motor vehicle concerned without the consent of the owner or person in charge (an equivalent to aggravated TWOC); *driver was driving more than over the speed limit; or *person was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by the police If a defendant is tried in District Court for dangerous driving occasioning death, but none of the circumstances of aggravation can be proven, the maximum imprisonment is 10 years. A conviction in Magistrates Court can result in imprisonment of up to and including 3 years. In NSW, the maximum term of imprisonment, for a conviction of dangerous driving occasioning death, is: *14 years, if: the person's blood alcohol content was 0.15 or more; the person drove the vehicle at 45 or more km/h over the posted speed limit; the person drove the vehicle to escape the police; or the person drove under the influence of drugs or a combination of drink and drugs *10 years, if none of the above circumstances of aggravation was present at the time of the offence The equivalent, in Queensland, to \\"Causing death by dangerous driving\\", is \\"Dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death\\". Under Section 328A of the Queensland Criminal Code, the maximum penalties, for this offence, are: *14 years, if the driver: operated the vehicle at more than 40 km/h (25 mph) over the posted speed limit was under the influence of drink or drugs knew or ought to have known, that bodily harm or death resulted, and the death of the victim so results, but nonetheless failed to remain at the scene of the collision, \\"other than to obtain medical or other help for the other person, before a police officer arrives\\" *10 years, if none of the above circumstances of aggravation is present Driving disqualifications handed down by Australian courts, whether inside or outside Queensland, will result in the suspension of Queensland driving privileges. Disqualifications for dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death are included. =Canada= In Canada, the Criminal Code has several road traffic offences equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving. The basic offence, \\"Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death\\", has a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. If the driver is convicted of failing to stop for police, criminal negligence, street racing, a hit and run or drink-driving, in addition to dangerous driving, and a death resulted, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. A person's Canada- wide driving privileges will be suspended, for any Criminal Code driving conviction, although lengths of suspensions vary by province and territory. In some cases, a driver's licence can be taken away permanently after a certain number of Criminal Code driving convictions, as in the province of Ontario.Ontario Ministry of Transportation: \\"Other Ways to Lose your Licence\\" Some provinces and American states have agreements to mutually recognize road traffic offences that occur out-of-province or out-of-state. Traffic violations that occur in Michigan and New York for vehicular homicide are counted, for licence suspension purposes, on a person's Ontario driving record.Ontario: \\"What happens if I get out-of-province demerit points?\\" Vehicular homicide convictions in Maine and New York are counted on a driver's Quebec driving record (see also \\"United States\\" above). =Ireland (Republic)= An equivalent, under Republic of Ireland traffic laws, to causing death by dangerous driving, is \\"Dangerous driving causing death\\". The maximum period of imprisonment, for such a conviction, is 10 years. The minimum licence suspension is 5 years. The UK and Republic of Ireland are parties to the 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01) and therefore convictions for dangerous driving causing death in the UK are counted on a person's Republic of Ireland driving record. =United States (not including overseas dependencies)= In many American states, vehicular homicide is an equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving. Maximum prison sentences and licence suspension lengths vary by state. Vehicular homicide, under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, is often classified as a \\"major violation\\", with the following minimum CDL suspensions applicable country-wide: * for a 1st conviction: 3-year suspension from operating commercial motor vehicles designed to transport hazardous materials; otherwise, 1 year * for a 2nd conviction: lifetime, although 10 years if a state allows CDL privileges to be reinstated Some states, such as Florida and Virginia, count out-of-state traffic violations, so long as they occurred anywhere else in the United States, the same as traffic violations that occurred in the state in which the driver was licensed. Vehicular homicide convictions are included. Other states, such as New York and Maine, count some traffic violations that occur in Canada, the same as if those violations had occurred in those states.

The show explores a situation in which two teenagers meet in an Internet chatroom, using personas that are very different from their true selves. They become friends, but both fear having the other discover their true identities. Cast *Noah King ‚Äì Jack Blumenau ‚Äì a socially inexperienced boy from London, England. He lives with his mother, football-loving father and brother and later his cousin Eddie. He runs a webcomic called \\"Max Hammer\\", which is based on his life and the people around him. Later in the series, his personality changes into becoming more like Max, such as spending less time online, getting a girlfriend for a time and even playing football. *Saskia Litras ‚Äì Hannah Greenwood ‚Äì A shy, musical girl from Melbourne, Australia. She lives with her single mother, works at the Chicken Coop after school. Her original reason for creating the character of Indy was to confront Max for stealing some of her music illegally, although this leads her to become Noah's partner in his webcomic \\"Max Hammer\\". As the series progresses, her personality changes into more like being Indy, such as playing music in public and even becoming more confident at school. At first, she had a crush on Max, but those feelings faded for a time when Max told her he only thought of her as a friend. *Max Hammer ‚Äì Cameron Nugent *Indy ‚Äì Maria Papas *Renee ‚Äì Emily Wheaton *Clive ‚Äì Adrian Fergus Fuller *Specs ‚Äì Alex Yates *Eddie ‚Äì Eugene Simon *Deb Litras ‚Äì Tracy Mann *Ernesto ‚Äì Bernard Angel Themes Noah and Saskia is about an internet relationship between two teenagers and its effects on their lives. Although the teenagers deceive each other with \\"false personas\\", their relationship is shown to be positive and important. Saskia finds that her alter ego, Indy, allows her to express aspects of her personality that she is uncomfortable with or unable to express normally. Indy is confident and sexy where Saskia is nervous and shy. By asking herself \\"What would Indy do?\\", Saskia learns to be more assertive and, in some ways, becomes Indy herself. From the ABC website: \\"'Noah & Saskia' is about a little lie that leads to a bigger truth ‚Äì that who you say you are is usually who you want to be.\\" Many novels, films and books that deal with internet relationships depict them as dangerous, especially for teenagers. The more balanced view put forth in Noah and Saskia has been welcomed by many people who have experienced internet friendships firsthand. Production Noah and Saskia is an international co- production produced in Australia by the Australian Children's Television Foundation in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and in the United Kingdom by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Each episode of the show follows one of the main characters in their home country - Saskia in Australia, or Noah in England. Each country has an independent cast. As a result, the two main characters never met before or during the production. Moreover, all of the Australian footage was filmed before Jack Blumenau had been cast as Noah. Furthermore, the two halves are very different stylistically; Saskia directly addresses the camera and has flashbacks and daydreams, while Noah's side is shown objectively. Noah and Saskia meet in person in the last episode of the series. However, the scene was created digitally after filming Jack Blumenau and Hannah Greenwood separately. In the final shot of this scene Noah and Saskia are standing face to face. When Hannah Greenwood filmed this shot, Noah had not been cast. To ensure the two characters appeared to be looking directly at each other, three different versions of Saskia's half of this shot were filmed, with Hannah Greenwood looking at Noah stand-ins of three different heights.

Early life He was born in Shizuoka Prefecture in 1934 and studied Kinko-ryu and Azuma styles of music with his father, Rampo Yokoyama, and grandfather, Koson Yokoyama. At the age of 25, Yokoyama began to study with Fukuda Rando, founder of the Azuma School and with Watazumi Doso, a legendary Fuke master who sought to synthesize shakuhachi music and spirituality within the context of Zen Buddhism. Guided by these two eminent masters, Yokoyama was able to combine the modernism of Rando with the deeply religious traditional spirit of Watazumido in his training. With this foundation, he came to develop a remarkably powerful and creative style that embodied both ends of the continuum. A descendant of the Kinko tradition transmitted down through the generations, he also pioneered a revolution in modern music that swept across post-War Japan. Career In 1960, Yokoyama completed his studies at the NHK Japanese Traditional Music Training Center and, a year later, formed Shakuhachi San-Jyuso-dan, a trio devoted to furthering new music for the instrument. In 1963, he founded the Nihon Ongaku Shudan (Japanese Music Group) and Shakuhachi Sanbon-kai (Group of Three Shakuhachi) with Kinko master Aoki Reibo and Tozan master Hozan Yamamoto. The group helped to establish a new genre of music for the shakuhachi in trio. Yokoyama achieved international attention for his New York City premiere performance in November 1967, of T≈çru Takemitsu's composition November Steps, for shakuhachi, biwa, and orchestra, with the New York Philharmonic, under the direction of Seiji Ozawa (with biwa player Tsuruta Kinshi). Standing and honors Up until his death Katsuya Yokoyama was head of the Chikushin-kai Shakuhachi Guild. He has been the recipient of many prestigious awards, amongst them the Geijutsu Sen-sho (Art Award) in 1971, the Geijutsu-sai Yushu-sho (Art Excellence Award) in 1972, the Geijutsu-sai Tai- sho (Art Festival Grand Prize) in 1973 given by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and the Ongaku no Tomo-sha Award in 1991. In 1988, Yokoyama founded the Kokusai Shakuhachi Kenshu Center (International Shakuhachi Training Center) located in Bisei-cho, Okayama, Japan where he hosted the first International Shakuhachi Festival in 1993. This event precipitated founding of the World Shakuhachi Society and Festival held in Boulder, Colorado in 1998. At this gathering, five of the world's greatest shakuhachi masters, including Yokoyama, performed in a single venue for the first time ever. In 2002, the Japanese government honored Katsuya Yokoyama for a lifetime of achievement by awarding him the esteemed Shiju Hosho (Purple Ribbon Medal) award. Death Yokoyama died on April 21, 2010.

Johnston's songs are often about troubled loners, and cover topics like heartbreak, alienation, and disappointment. Known for his songcraft, he has been described as a \\"songwriter's songwriter\\". Early life Johnston was raised in the small town of Kinsley, Kansas. His interest in music was hampered by the fact that there were no record shops or music stores in his hometown. When he was 16, he bought his first guitar from a mail-order catalog, and at 17 had a friend drive him 35 miles to the nearest record store to buy an Elvis Costello album he had read about. When he graduated high school, and left to attend the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, he immersed himself in the new wave music scene there. Music career Johnston moved to New York City in 1985. With the typing skills he had acquired in high school, he supported himself in New York as an office worker at an architecture firm for a number of years as well as in the restaurant industry, prior to pursuing music on a full-time basis. He decided to change his name to Freedy Johnston, as \\"Freedy\\" was a nickname that his mother had given him, and Johnston was his mother's maiden name. After a few years in New York, he signed with independent label Bar/None Records, who debuted two of his songs on sampler called Time for a Change (1989). Bar/None released Johnston's first album, The Trouble Tree in 1990. While the reviews were generally favorable, the album was not commercially successful. Johnston sold some of his family's farmland to finance the recording of his second album, Can You Fly (an event he wrote about in an opening track on that album, \\"Trying to Tell You I Don't Know\\"). The album, released in 1992, was selected by The New York Times as one of the best albums of the year. Johnston followed up with his 1994 major label debut, This Perfect World, released on Elektra Records and produced by Butch Vig of Garbage. The album received positive reviews and led to Rolling Stone naming Johnston \\"songwriter of the year.\\" Other publications, including The New York Times, Spin, and Musician Magazine gave the album high marks as well. It featured the single \\"Bad Reputation\\", which reached 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is one of his best-known songs. He released his next three albums under Elektra: Never Home (produced by Danny Kortchmar), Blue Days Black Nights (produced by T-Bone Burnett), and Right Between the Promises. Johnston and fellow musicians Jay Moran, James \\"Pie\\" Cowan, Duke Erikson, and Butch Vig perform occasional shows as a covers band called \\"The Know-it-All Boyfriends\\". Vig established the ensemble for his brother's Christmas party, soon became an ongoing venture. Johnston's songs appear on the soundtrack albums for Kingpin (1996), Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), Heavy (1995), and Kicking and Screaming (1995). He later recorded a cover of the folk song \\"Peg and Awl\\" for Ed Pettersen and Janet Reno's Song of America compilation of 2007. In early 2008, he released his own album of covers, My Favorite Waste of Time, followed by a new studio album, Rain on the City in January 2010. In the late 2000s, Johnston began playing and writing songs with another singer- songwriter, Jon Dee Graham. The two were preparing to record an album when they saw Susan Cowsill perform at the 2009 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They invited her to join the project, and as a trio wrote and recorded the studio album At Least We Have Each Other (Freedom Records, 2012), under the name The Hobart Brothers and Lil' Sis Hobart.

She was the only empress of Wu's founding emperor, Sun Quan, even though he had a succession of wives before her. She was the mother of Sun Liang, Sun Quan's successor and the second emperor of Wu. Life Lady Pan was from Gouzhang County (; within present-day Ningbo) in Kuaiji Commandery. Her personal name was not recorded in her biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), the authoritative source of the history of the Three Kingdoms period. However, the Jiankang Shilu mentioned that her personal name was \\"Shu\\", hence she was also known as \\"Pan Shu\\". Her father, who served as a low-ranking official, was executed for committing an offence whose details are not recorded. Both Lady Pan and her elder sister were forced to become servants and assigned to the royal textile factory. Once, Sun Quan encountered her and felt that she was extraordinary so he took her as his concubine. The historical treatise Shi Yi Ji mentioned that Lady Pan was known as the most beautiful woman in Jiangdong. When she was still working in the textile factory, she was alienated and called goddess by people who worked with her. After Sun Quan heard about this story, he ordered the painter to draw Lady Pan's portrait. Although Lady Pan looked glum in the portrait, Sun Quan was shocked because of her beauty and exclaimed:\\"She is a goddess,indeed. Her sadness is so attractive, let alone her smile.\\" In the palace, Lady Pan was becoming increasingly favoured by Sun Quan so that he built a palace called Liuhuantai () for her, which means the palace of pomegranate and ring.()Shi Yi Ji vol. 8. In 243, while Lady Pan was pregnant, she dreamt of receiving a dragon head and gave birth to Sun Liang later. In 250, in the aftermath of a succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba, Sun Liang was designated as the crown prince by his father. In 251, Sun Quan instated Lady Pan as the empress. Empress Pan was known for being charming but jealous as she never ceased slandering and harming Sun Quan's other wives until her death.() Sanguozhi vol. 50. Death When Sun Quan became seriously ill in 252, Empress Pan asked Sun Hong (), the Prefect of the Palace Writers (), about how Empress L√º seized power after the death of her husband (Emperor Gao of the Han Dynasty). However, she herself also fell sick due to the stress of continuously attending to Sun Quan. She was ultimately murdered when she was in a coma, but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep and claimed her death was of natural causes; while a number of historians, including Hu Sanxing, the commentator to Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, believed that top Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as empress dowager after Sun Quan's death. Investigation into her death resulted in the executions of 6-7 people. Sun Quan died soon after in the same year. Empress Pan was buried together with Sun Quan at the Jiang Mausoleum (; at the Purple Mountain, Nanjing, Jiangsu).() Sanguozhi vol. 50. The historian Hu Sanxing commented in his annotations to the Zizhi Tongjian that the murder of Empress Pan was probably a conspiracy by top officials in Eastern Wu because they feared that she would seize power after Sun Quan's death.() Zizhi Tongjian (annotated version) vol. 75. Family In 250, Lady Pan requested Sun Quan to emancipate her elder sister from slavery and arrange a marriage for her sister and he agreed. Lady Pan's sister later married Tan Shao (). When Sun Liang became the new emperor, he commissioned his uncle as a Cavalry Commandant (). After Sun Liang was demoted to a prince under Sun Chen's persecution. Tan Shao also lost his official position and was sent back to Luling, the hometown of him with his family.() Sanguozhi vol. 50.

It was released by Columbia Pictures in the U.S. on 13 April 1990, and was released in the rest of the world by 20th Century Fox. Plot The film comprises four storylines, which run in parallel and interact: #Xixo trying to find his lost children #Two elephant poachers travelling in a truck on which Xixo's children are stuck #A zoologist and a lawyer stranded in a desert #Two soldiers fighting each other The story starts with two elephant poachers, the chronically mean \\"Big Ben\\" Brenner and his affable but not-very-bright assistant George, crossing the area in which Xixo's tribe lives. Curious about their vehicle, Xixo's son Xiri and daughter Xisa climb into the water tank trailer and are taken for an involuntary ride as the poachers continue. Xixo follows on foot, determined to retrieve his children. Dr. Ann Taylor, a young lawyer from New York City, arrives at a bush resort to give a lecture at a legal conference. Since she has spare time, she accepts the invitation of a young man to take a joyride in a two-seat, twin engine ultralight aircraft. They go to see scientist Dr. Stephen Marshall, who has just been radioed that he must report to the resort where Dr. Taylor just came from to tend to a wounded animal they have found. Leaving the other pilot to watch his truck and equipment, he heads for the resort in the ultralight with Ann aboard, but encounter severe weather and crash, stranding them in the Kalahari desert. In addition, war is brewing, personified by a lost Cuban soldier (Mateo) and his Angolan enemy (Timi), who repeatedly attempt to take each other prisoner. In the course of the movie, all these people cross paths with Xixo and/or his children. Finally, the plot culminates in the poachers capturing Xixo, Taylor, Marshall, and the two soldiers. Xixo manages to save them, and George, who is actually a nice guy kept under the heel of his boss, gives Xixo directions to his children. The poachers are captured, both soldiers come to somewhat reluctant terms and part without further violence, Taylor and Marshall return to civilization (though not without a last embarrassing accident), entering into a romantic relationship, and Xixo finds his children.

Their \\"Electric Liturgy\\" performed in 1968 was the first documented Christian rock worship service, and their 1969 eponymous debut RCA album was one of the earliest Christian rock albums released. History =Formation= Mind Garage was formed after a five person band from Morgantown, West Virginia called the Glass Menagerie disbanded in July 1967 after touring the Midwest. Those leaving the Glass Menagerie were John Fisher, lead guitarist, who joined the Shadows of Knight as a bass player; and Jim Straub, the drummer. The remaining three members, Larry McClurg, Jack Bond, and Norris Lytton returned to Morgantown where they were all students at West Virginia University. After meeting two other WVU students, John Vaughan and Ted Smith, it was decided to form a new band. The band was encouraged by WVU's campus minister, Episcopal priest Rev. Michael Paine, who helped the group to organize its religious repertory.The Living Church, Vol. 157 (Morehouse-Gorham Co., 1968):70. Paine's wife, Victoria \\"Tori\\" Paine, suggested the name Mind Garage to the band. =The Electric Liturgy= In 1967 Paine suggested the band write rock music with Christian content for use in the church, following the tradition of Bach who used popular tavern songs in his music. \\"At that time, there were virtually no albums available to a national audience that could remotely be described as Christian rock; it's impossible to overstate how radical the \\"Electric Liturgy\\" was in that context. The Mind Garage, which never limited itself to one style of music began composing the Electric Liturgy in Paine's attic with a serious intent to get the message across. The Electric Liturgy was conceived as an orthodox Episcopalian service, but was immediately transformed into an inter-denominational service by the people themselves. It was not uncommon to witness Episcopalians, Catholics, Protestants and Jews together, all taking Communion. People who were out of religion found a meaning in the music. The live presentation of the Electric Liturgy contains the Kyrie Eleison and The Service of the Word (Greeting, Opening Prayer, First Reading, Psalm, Epistle Reading, Gospel Reading, Sermon, Creed, Pastoral Prayer and the Offertory), immediately followed by the Service of Communion which concludes with a prayer and Benediction and the dismissal of the congregation. The church programs explained that \\"the Holy Communion is the Creator's act through His people of binding the wounds and healing a broken humanity. Sometimes it is a party, sometimes not. But participation in it signals your desire to take on hope. Therefore all people confessing their frail humanity and yearning for a greater are welcome to come to the altar and receive Holy Communion.\\" This is the same format used by \\"Presbyterian, Methodist, and Episcopal service books, historic liturgies from the Catholic Church and the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church, and ancient liturgies from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Cappadocia...which all have the same basic structure.\\" On March 10, 1968, in the first documented Christian rock worship service, the Mind Garage played live in church, \\"...as cymbals crashed and voices called for love and thanksgiving, babies squealed and happy smiles spontaneously flickered across the congregation\\". As a result, \\"those dirty, beatnick-hippies began to have a new image. 'I didn't know they were like THAT,' one woman exclaimed, \\"That was beautiful!\\" The April 14, 1968 Easter Sunday performance originally scheduled on West Virginia University property was cancelled when university administrators backed out of the previous arrangement with Paine and declared the performance unconstitutional. Paine then bargained with the First Presbyterian church to use their parking lot. In the mounting tension the church elders refused to allow the band to use the church facilities when the local paper ran a photo of the Mind Garage in a tree with Paine and friends standing about. At the last moment Rev. Jennings Fast of Wesley Methodist Church provided a place for the service. The Electric Liturgy became so popular the band was invited to perform the worship service in churches throughout the Eastern United States including Washington, D.C., New York, and Princeton University Chapel. The Electric Liturgy was shocking. Dean Ernest Gordon of Princeton University said, \\"We could all do with a shocking splendid spiritual surprise.\\" On July 24, 1968, the term \\"theo-rock\\" was coined in the Village Voice in reference to The Mind Garage music. By the end of 1968, the Mind Garage had performed the \\"Electric Liturgy\\" live more than a dozen times, in Episcopal, Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches, each time with people dancing in the aisles. Each time the services were attended by Christians and non Christians alike in a communal celebration of life. The Mind Garage \\"literally packed the church\\". What they did was \\"...to contemporize religious music. Make it for people today, much as John Wesley or Martin Luther did. Mind Garage: First nationally televised Christian Rock worship service A nationally televised Christian Rock and Roll worship service was given by the Mind Garage in St. Mark's Episcopal church in New York on ABC TV, on April 13, 1969. The Electric Liturgy, recorded for RCA Victor (LSP-4319) in 1969 was the first Christian Rock album ever recorded in Nashville, at RCA's \\"Nashville Sound\\" Studio A, on Music Row. An award-winning article by Joyce Tracewell describes the Electric Mass: \\"Sun shines through stained glass and colors bounce until the kaleidoscopic vision is suddenly shattered by incredibly swelling music. Smiling musicians with flowery clothes, jeans, long hair, beards and sunglasses play deliberate alien music, the kind that makes you shiver. It fills the room to the ceiling pushing against the walls. They sing in voices that should have belonged to Druids or Incas, or Gypsies under a night sky, and you see Jesus smiling at them. When you leave you feel somebody has been dissecting your soul and everything is clearer. And that's what an Electric Mass is.\\" One poster associated with the Mind Garage is a line drawing of a bare chested woman with long flowing hair that nearly covers the chest, with her arms raised, surrounded by the group. It was used several times as the cover for service booklets, most notably in St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New York City's Bowery. An adaptation was created for the Electric Liturgy by covering the woman's chest with a banner displaying the words \\"We Welcome You To The Electric Liturgy, A Festival of Feeling, The Electric Mass\\". =Recording career= While still known only locally, the Mind Garage recorded an original single 45 rpm \\"Asphalt Mother\\", and drew the attention of major record companies like Chess Records, Atlantic Records and RCA. Marshall Chess came to see the band expecting to hear blues and went away baffled as to the kind of music they played. Atlantic Records only wanted to sign McClurg, but he refused to leave the band. Meanwhile, the Mind Garage continued to play the Electric Mass in church services for free wherever asked, while at the same time shocking and entertaining the audiences in clubs, concert halls and stadiums with their own style of secular, psychedelic rock. In 1969 the group's newly acquired manager, Tom Surman, aka Cossie, negotiated a contract for the entire band with RCA. The Mind Garage recorded two albums and two singles in New York, Chicago and Nashville studios. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service entertained troops at home and abroad in Vietnam with the music of the Mind Garage and other artists such as Gary Lewis, Bob Seger, and Percy Faith. The Mind Garage often appeared with groups such as Canned Heat, Sly and the Family Stone, Paul Butterfield, all of whom played at Woodstock 1969. =Hiatus= The Mind Garage declined the invitation to perform at Woodstock in 1969. In 1970, when their recording contract was about to expire, RCA offered to renew it but the band declined. Without explanation they walked away from a recording career, and simply stopped playing. The band never officially broke up. There was no press release, and no dispute among members, or management. Drummer Ted Smith, acknowledged by Zildjian as one of the best drummers in the world, continued his career with the Spinners as tour drummer for the next several decades, and can be heard on the Spinners \\"LIVE\\" album (Atlantic SD 2-910-1198). =Reunion= Mind Garage at Goodstock Music Festival In 2007 all five original band members reunited for a music festival. The Father of Woodstock Artie Kornfeld teamed up with Larry McClurg to promote Goodstock Music Festival, reported Pollstar. According to Kornfeld, \\"I consider Goodstock to be the first real attempt to have another 3 days of peace and music\\". \\"When everybody's doing Woodstocks in 2009, I'm going to be doing Goodstock -The Woodstock Reunion 2009, and that's my dream for Larry and I to have.\\" Significance Christian rock music did not exist in 1967 for mainstream American media. As alternative styles of music developed \\"...Christian Rock Music began in the 1970s when a group known as the Mind Garage recorded \\"Electric Liturgy\\".The Politics of Values: Games Political Strategists Play, Jo Renee Formicola, Published by Rowman & Littlefield 2008 Page 64 The Mind Garage is perhaps the first Christian Rock band, with documentation going back to 1967 in local media and national magazines and newspapers and television such as The Village Voice, Billboard and Rolling Stone magazine, ABC and NBC TV. \\"Today original records from many of the original Jesus Rock bands like The Mind Garage (arguably the first band of its kind), Aslan, Selah, The Concrete Rubber Band, and Agape go for hundreds of dollars to collectors...\\". For as little time as the Mind Garage performed, their original, unique style and energy had a ripple effect that reached the Punk era and new wave music and beyond. The late 1970s group The Fleshtones refer to the Mind Garage as an influence. Noted folk rock musician John Denver acknowledged each member of the Mind Garage for contributing to his 1982 album, Seasons of the Heart.

The notes recorded by the script supervisor during the shooting of a scene are used to help the editor cut the scene. They are also responsible for keeping track of the film production unit's daily progress. The script supervisor credit typically appears in the closing credits of a motion picture. Script supervisors are a department head and play a crucial role in the shooting of a film. It is the job of script supervisor to monitor the camera seeks to keep scene.http://getinmedia.com/careers/script-supervisor In the most basic description, the script supervisor is the editor's and writer's representative on set, as well as being the right hand aide to the director and the director of photography. It is the script supervisor's job to make sure that the film can be cut together after shooting has concluded. In that sense, they back up every department, monitor the script during shooting and make sure that errors in continuity do not occur that would prevent the film from being able to be compiled smoothly in the editing room. In pre- production, the script supervisor creates a number of reports based on the script, including a one-line continuity synopsis providing basic information on each scene such as the time of day, day in story order, and a one line synopsis of the scene. These reports are used by various departments in order to determine the most advantageous shot order and ensure that all departments, including production, wardrobe, set dressing, hair and makeup, are in sync in regard to the progression of time within the story. The script supervisor MAY also time the script, which is of enormous benefit for the director and the producer, and will often attend a table read or read-through with the cast.  Responsibilities  During production, the script supervisor acts as a central point for all production information on a film shoot, and has several responsibilities: * Continuity ‚Äì The supervisor is responsible for working with all departments (camera, lighting, sound, wardrobe, make-up, properties and sets) to make sure that continuity errors do not happen. The script supervisor takes notes on all the details required to re-create the continuity of a particular scene, location, or action. For every take, the script supervisor will note the duration of the take (usually with a stopwatch) and meticulously log information into a daily editor log about the action of the take, including position of the main actor(s), screen direction of their movement, important actions performed during the shot, type of lens used, and additional information which may vary from case to case. When multiple cameras are in use, the script supervisor keeps separate notes on each. These logs also notate a director's comments on any particular take as to whether it is no good, a hold take (ok, but not perfect), or a print take (a good take). All of these notes are crucial not just for continuity ‚Äì they provide the editor information on what the director prefers, any problems with any of the takes and other notes to assist the editing process. * Axis and Eyelines ‚Äì The script supervisor is also the go-to person for determining the axis of a scene. The supervisor keeps track of and helps the director and the camera- operator set the camera position and off-camera eyelines ensuring that the coverage of a scene cuts seamlessly and that the characters within a scene always appear, without any confusion on the part of the viewer, to be looking precisely at the intended character or object. * Slating ‚Äì The script supervisor interacts with the clapper loader (second camera assistant) and the production sound mixer to make sure that each take of exposed film has a consistent and meaningful slate, that the sound and picture slates match. The script supervisor also notes the sound roll of each sync take, and the state of all MOS takes. This ensures that there is proper identification on the film footage in the editing room so the editor can find and use the correct takes. * Script ‚Äì The script supervisor is responsible for keeping the most current version of the shooting script. During shooting, the script supervisor notates any changes from the screenplay that are made by the actors, director or others during the actual filming process. If significant changes are made to the script that affect a future day's shooting, the script supervisor is responsible for providing those changes to the assistant director's team who then will distribute those changes to the rest of the crew. The script supervisor's script is also referred to as their lined script because during shooting, a script supervisor draws a vertical line down the page for each different camera setup. Each line designates the start and stop of that setup, a quick note of what the shot description was and whether or not the dialogue was on camera for that setup. This allows the editor to quickly reference which camera setups cover which portion of the dialogue or action. * Production Reports ‚Äì At the end of each shooting day, the script supervisor prepares daily reports for the production team. These reports vary in form depending on the studio or production company; however, they generally include a log of the actual times that shooting and breaks started and stopped, and a breakdown of the pages, scenes and minutes that were shot that day, as well as the same information for the previous day, the total script and the amounts remaining to be done. Also included are the number of scenes covered (completely shot), the number of retakes (when a scene has to be reshot), and the number of wild tracks. The script supervisor is the official timekeeper on any set. * Editor's Notes ‚Äì In addition to the production reports, each shooting day the script supervisor also compiles the continuity logs for the day's shooting as well as the relevant lined script pages for the scenes shot that day. Those notes are sent off to the editorial staff to assist them in the editing process. The script supervisor is the primary liaison between the director (who decides what scenes are to be shot) and the editor (who is usually not present during actual filming but needs to have exact records of the filming in order to do the job of cutting the film together). The script supervisor is a technical rather than artistic position and is generally considered as part of the director's team. There is usually only one script supervisor on a given film production. However, on big studio productions, the Main Unit script supervisor will have an assistant and there is usually a Second Unit script supervisor.  Earlier terms  Up until the late thirties and early forties, the script supervisor in the American film and television industry was typically called the continuity clerk, script reader or script girl and often there were 2 people doing the job. One was the \\"continuity clerk\\" and one was the \\"script girl\\". Individuals performing such duties were either credited with these titles or, more often, not credited at all. During this span of time, many script supervisors were indeed women, a fact that originally spawned the title \\"script girl.\\" However, over the years, script supervisor positions throughout the American motion picture industry became more thoroughly integrated and formed a better balance among men and women. This fact, coupled with producers' desire to promote gender neutrality in a position that was increasingly taken up by men, produced the gradual change in nomenclature. By the fifties, the gender-specific term had virtually disappeared from film and television credits, but sometimes appeared in everyday speech.  History  Sarah Y. Mason is widely regarded as the first script supervisor, having invented the craft of film continuity for director Albert Parker for the film Arizona in 1918, for which she was credited as \\"Continuity Girl.\\"The Official Tumblr of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. \\"Sarah Y.

The Acorna Universe series includes ten science fantasy novels, the first two by McCaffrey and Ball, while the following ones were co-written by McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough (1999 to 2007). . Retrieved 2011-11-03. The Acorna series is a sub-set of the Federated Sentient Planets Universe. Other sub-sets include the Crystal Singer series, the Brain and Brawn Ship series and the Dragonriders of Pern series, all predominantly authored by Anne McCaffrey. Other contributors to the Acorna series include Jody Lynn Nye, Lyman Frakoss, Roman R. Ranieri and Mickey Zucker Reichert. . Retrieved 2015-01-08. The series focuses primarily on the character, the orphaned Unicorn-girl introduced in the first book. Acorna has special powers including the abilities to heal, make things grow, detect venom, detect chemical imbalances, detect mineral and metal deposits, purify water and air, and communicate telepathically. The first book introduces her as a \\"youngling\\" and features her journey of understanding her individualism. Acorna's appearance Besides the single horn, situated halfway between her brow and her forehead, Acorna can, with the right attires, pass as a tall and graceful young lady. However, a closer look would reveal that she is not human. The following are her distinguishing features: *A flowing silvery mane from her head down to her back, similar to that of a horse. The same silvery curls are also on her calves. *Her feet end in equine hooves similar to those of traditional unicorn media. In cover art her feet are pictured looking as horse hooves. *Her fingers only have two joints, one at the knuckle and the other in the middle of her fingers. In cover art her hands are pictured as identical to those of humans. *Her eyes are silvery and her pupils narrow into a silver sliver when she is disappointed or sad. Acorna is also born more mature than human infants and grows to adulthood within four years. She is unusually intelligent and can learn extremely quickly. Acorna is strictly vegetarian. Origin Acorna's parents eject her in an escape pod just before blowing up their own spaceship, deliberately killing themselves in order to destroy the pursuing Khleevi. Acorna's pod is found by space miners: Gill, Rafik, and Calum. They end up raising the unusual child as a daughter. Her upbringing with the miners is chronicled in Acorna: The Unicorn Girl. Acorna's mother (avi) and father (lalli) are Feriila and Vaanye of the Renyilaaghe. Her mother is sister to Extraordinary Envoy Neeva (visedhaanye ferilii), as introduced to Delszaki Li in Acorna's Quest. Neeva tells Acorna that she has Feriila's eyes when they first meet. Her father was a scientist who 'had adapted his researches into the topology of space to weapons research shortly before his death'. An unexpected side-effect of her father's weapons technology transported Acorna's escape pod to where the miners found it. Acorna's great- grandmother, Niikaavri of Clan Geeyiinah, was responsible for the design of the egg-ships use by Acorna's people. Acorna is also related to Grandam Naadiina, oldest resident on narhii-Vhiliinyar (New Home) and through her to Maati, Aari, Laarye and their parents, Miiri and Kaarlye. Race Acorna belongs to a race of humanoids called Linyaari. She finds this out in Acorna's Quest when she encounters her aunt ('mother-sister') and her fellow shipmates. The Linyaari are a peaceful race whose planet, Vhiliinyar, or \\"Home of the People\\", was invaded by the insect-like Khleevi, forcing them to move to narhii-Vhiliinyar, or \\"New Home of the People\\". They flee shortly before the Khleevi invasion, which destroys their home world Vhiliinyar in search of an unknown objective. They are a beautiful race, tall and graceful, with abilities to heal wounds and purify substances such as air and water. They can also communicate telepathically with each other. Partially descended from unicorns, Ancestors who still live among them, cared for by specific attendants. Like the Ancestors, the Linyaari are a peace-loving people and do not tolerate violence in any of its forms, even going so far as to not have any military or weapons to speak of. The only weapon at all was being developed by Acorna's father and was a form of suicide that destroyed the user's ship and the Khleevis' as well. Linyaari legend relates that unicorns were rescued from their native planet (Earth) by the Ancestral Friends or Ancestral Hosts to escape persecution by the new creatures, men. The Linyaari are products of genetic engineering, a blending of the Hosts and the unicorns. In a temporal paradox, Ancestral Host, Grimalkin, extracts one of the twin embryos from the mating of Acorna and Aari to create the Linyaari race. The series Acorna's Children chronicles the twins' independent lives and ultimate reunion. Relationship In the third book, Acorna's World, Acorna meets Aari, a Linyaari who was captured and tortured by the Khleevi after the evacuation of the home world. He feels that he has no reason to live, being physically broken and mentally scarred. Acorna is the first Linyaari he meets on his arrival and she does not shrink from his hornlessness as the other Linyaari cannot help doing. Although he is attracted to her, he believes that she is much too good for him. After time spent together and many adventures, including a Khleevi nearly killing her, the feelings they have for each other emerge, but they are both shy. When they make it back to the Moon Of Opportunity, the children there use holograms to have them admit their feelings. In the next book, Acorna's Search, Aari is kidnapped by a member of an ancient race of time travelers, called Grimalkin. Acorna follows them through time and space until, in the last book, Acorna's Triumph, she and Aari are reunited.

History In 1921, the Jolly family built a ranch and home on 160 acres located at what is today the corner of Scottsdale and Indian Bend roads. This was purchased by Merle Cheney in 1942, who not long afterwards sold it to Fowler and Anne McCormick. Between 1942 and 1954, Anne and Fowler had begun to purchase parcels of land all around the Jolly/Cheney parcel. The ranch was primarily used as a winter home by the McCormicks, as they admired the warmer climate. Fowler was not a stranger to money. His maternal grandfather was John D. Rockefeller Sr., while his paternal grandfather was Cyrus McCormick, the inventor of the mechanical reaper, which would form the foundation for the company later known as International Harvester. Fowler would later go on to be president and chairman of the board for International Harvester. Anne McCormick was a lover of Arabian horses. In the mid-1950s, she devoted 150 acres of the northern part of her ranch near what is today the intersection of Shea Boulevard and Pima Road as an equestrian center devoted to Arabian horses, and called it Paradise Park. The Arabian Horse Association of Arizona held their annual show at Paradise Park from 1956 (its second year) through 1968, when it was moved to WestWorld. The Arizona Arabian Horse Show was the first of its kind dedicated to Arabian horses. After Anne McCormick's death in 1969, a portion of the McCormick's land, about 4,236 acres, was sold to Kaiser-Aetna in the summer of 1970 for a purchase price of $12.1 million. Richard F Boultinghouse was the General Manager of McCormick Ranch and responsible for its real estate development. The development was incorporated in 1972, and according to real estate websites for the area, it has two championship 18-hole golf courses (McCormick Ranch Golf Club's Palm Course and Pine Course), more than 25 miles of bicycle paths, parks, public tennis courts, and 130 acres of man-made lakes (7 lakes total). Location McCormick Ranch lies in what is considered \\"central Scottsdale,\\" between Indian Bend Road to the south and the Shea Boulevard corridor to the north. The Town of Paradise Valley, Arizona is to the west, and the Salt River Pima‚ÄìMaricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC) is to the east. Size Covering an area of approximately 5 square miles, McCormick Ranch has almost 14,000 residents, for a population density of about 2700 people per square mile. Amenities In addition to those listed above, McCormick Ranch has many high-end shops and offices located along the arterial streets that form its perimeter, and a few along interior streets. Commercial and recreational developments on the SRPMIC to the east include The Scottsdale Pavilions outdoor shopping center, Talking Stick Resort and golf course, Salt River Fields at Talking Stick (spring training home of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball franchises), Odysea Aquarium, and the Butterfly Wonderland. Scottsdale City parks interior to McCormick Ranch include Mountain View Park, Comanche Park, Shoshone Park, and Zuni Park. Cochise Elementary School is adjacent to Mountain View Park. Many green spaces within and adjacent to McCormick Ranch are connected to the City of Scottsdale's Indian Bend Wash Greenbelt. The Mustang branch of the Scottsdale Public Library is just northeast of McCormick Ranch, as is the Shea Boulevard hospital campus of Scottsdale Healthcare.

His girth earned him the nickname \\"Hot Plate\\" Williams, in part to help distinguish him from John \\"Hot Rod\\" Williams of the Cleveland Cavaliers who likewise played college basketball in Louisiana (at Tulane University) and who also entered the NBA in 1986. Despite his size, in which he ballooned to close to 260 pounds by the time he was drafted, Williams was a highly skilled basketball player. He was in particular an exceptionally good passer, and averaged over 4 assists per game in 3 separate seasons, an excellent average for a player his size. He was frequently used as a point forward, handling the ball and conducting the offense. College career Williams played collegiately for LSU, and was drafted into the National Basketball Association by the Washington Bullets in 1986 with the 12th overall pick. Professional career As a rookie, Williams averaged just under ten points and five rebounds per game for the Bullets. He improved significantly his second season, and started 37 of 82 games. The 1988‚Äì89 NBA season, his third, was clearly his best, as he achieved career-high season totals in almost every statistical category, despite coming off the bench in all but one game. Williams' productivity declined in the five injury-plagued seasons that followed. He missed more than half of four of those five seasons due to various injuries, which, though not necessarily caused by his weight, were certainly aggravated by it. His eight-year NBA career included five seasons with the Bullets, two with the Los Angeles Clippers, and one (his final season) with the Indiana Pacers. He left the NBA in 1995, but went on to play 132 games over 6 seasons in the Spanish Liga ACB, averaging 15.6 points and 7.3 rebounds.  Weight issues and player profile  Williams' eating problems and weight issues were as a result of stress and depression. By the time he entered the draft, he lost his grandmother, two childhood friends, while supporting his mother, grandfather and children from previous marriages. His weight issues got so bad that Bullets and Clippers put him on weight reduction programs, and suspended him with no pay. By the time he played for the Pacers, his offensive skills and court vision had not diminished, but his vertical leap and stamina suffered significantly due to his weight, making him a defensive liability. At his lowest weight, he managed to drop to 235 lbs, but he'd mostly gained back up to about 260 lbs.

Eggs are beaten to a consistency similar to that used for an omelette and then steamed. It is sometimes referred to as egg custard on menus. If eaten cold, it has a taste and texture of a gelatin without sugar (unless added). Preparation The eggs are beaten and water added to create a more tender texture. A good ratio of water to eggs is 1.5:1. Sesame oil, soy sauce, or chicken broth may be used to add additional flavor. Other solid ingredients (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) may also be added to the mixture. The egg mixture is poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked. The eggs should be steamed until just firm, so that the texture of the eggs is still smooth and silky. A plate is usually placed on top of the bowl containing the egg mixture and left on while the egg is being steamed. Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam. Using four eggs, the average cooking time is 10 minutes with water, 7 minutes with chicken broth. However, this is in addition to the time needed for pre-boiling water. =Other cooking methods= This same dish can be cooked in a microwave, or in a pressure cooker. Both methods take less time, although the end product may not be of the same quality. Variations Homemade versions might include scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients are added to the egg mixture before steaming. It can also be enjoyed with soy sauce. The taste is usually savory (as opposed to a sweet custard).

It is the first part of the Calcutta trilogy. Set during the period of the Naxalite movement in Bengal, Pratidwandi tells the story of Siddharta, an educated middle-class man caught up in the turmoil of social unrest. Corruption and unemployment are rampant, and Siddhartha cannot align himself with either his revolutionary activist brother or his career-oriented sister. The film is known for experimenting with techniques such as photo-negative flashbacks. Plot Siddhartha (Dhritiman Chatterjee) is forced to discontinue his medical studies due to the unexpected death of his father. He has to now find a job instead. In one job interview, he is asked to name the most significant world event in the last ten years. His reply is 'the plain human courage shown by the people of Vietnam', instead of the expected: man landing on the moon. The interviewer asks if he is a communist. Needless to say, he does not get the job. He reaches a coffee shop where he is offered work for the communist party. When he does not show any interest, the party leader tells him about an opening for a medical representative. To escape from the heat and have a snooze, he goes into a cinema. As a government propaganda newsreel is being shown before the feature, a bomb explodes in the cinema hall. In the stampede that follows, Siddartha breaks his watch. He goes to a watchmaker but he cannot afford the repairs. Waiting to cross the road, he notices a beautiful woman. He drifts back to his days as a medical student in a flashback. The professor is explaining the anatomy of the female breast. Many flashbacks and dreams occur to Siddartha throughout the film. On his way to the hostel, he has an encounter with some hippies. Along with an ex-classmate, he goes out to see an uncensored Swedish film but, to their disappointment, the film turns out to be boring. In such constant wandering in Calcutta, disintegrating relationships with his sister and a Naxalite (militant communist) brother, his friendship with Keya is the only thing that keeps him sane. Keya is a simple girl. Siddharta and Keya enjoy each other's company but they cannot make any commitment to each other due to the circumstances. After yet another attempt at a job interview, Siddhartha leaves the big city to take a modest job as a salesman in a far off small town. He writes to Keya that he still cherishes their relationship. He also hears the call of a bird that he remembers from his childhood in his dreams but this time it is for real, and not in his mind. After completing the letter, he comes out to the balcony of his modest room. The bird calls again. He also hears the sombre chants of a funeral procession. As he turns to the camera, the picture is frozen. The ending is reminiscent of the first scene which shows the death of Siddhartha's father. However, the last scene is symbolic of the end of Siddhartha's aspirations of finding a job in Calcutta. Cast * Dhritiman Chatterjee as Siddhartha * Joysree Roy * Krishna Bose * Indira Devi * Kalyan Chowdhury * Debraj Roy * Sefali Reception & awards Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave it 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it a \\"particularly moving comedy\\" in which the protagonist \\"seethes with rage about social injustices, about economic corruption, but he is powerless to express it.\\" Dennis Schwartz, grading the film an A-, calls it a \\"[b]eautifully observed political film of disenfranchisement.\\" \\"Satyajit Ray\\", he writes, \\"gives his nod of approval to world-wide counter-culture revolution, the revolt of youth against the stagnant older generation, and the social upheaval taking place in his beloved Calcutta. But he also points out that India is a different animal than the Western countries in upheaval. He says it's because India has a different temperament after being oppressed so long by being colonized by the British and therefore the youth has to re- establish their own true identities before they can change things for the better.\\" \\" The message seemed accessible\\", he concludes, \\"but, perhaps, what was most inaccessible in this political drama, was Ray's wickedly droll sense of humor (like those timely placed X-rays to let us see the stark truth of reality).\\" James Travers gave the film a perfect score, noting \\"a significant stylistic shift from Ray's previous films, so much so that it may have shocked and surprised contemporary audiences who had grown accustomed to his poetic flavour of neo-realism during the previous decade.\\" He comments that the film's cinema verite style \\"suits its subject perfectly\\" and calls it an \\"[un]comfortable film to watch\\" due to its \\"austerity and bleakness that distance the spectator from the subject and, unusually for Ray, its harshness is not softened by poetic irony.\\" Writing for Sight & Sound, Tom Milne, considered that \\"[t]oo much [...] ha[d] been made of the increasingly direct political involvement in [...] The Adversary\\", finding parallels with his previous films such as Mahanagar, Kanchenjungha and Jalsaghar. Derek Malcolm wrote that the film's \\"lyrical flashback technique [...] does not always work out too well\\" despite having some \\"superb passages\\" and \\"that elusive quality of looking as deeply under the surface of things as almost anyone\\" in his writing and direction. He also defended the film from its detractors. The film holds a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 100% based on 6 reviews, with an average score of 7.5/10. The film won three Indian National Film Awards; including the National Film Award for Best Direction in 1971 and a nomination for the Gold Hugo Award, at the Chicago International Film Festival, 1971. Legacy Pratidwandi is the first film of Ray's \\"Calcutta Trilogy\\", which continued with Seemabaddha (1971) and Jana Aranya (1976). In 2012, filmmaker Ashim Ahluwalia included the film in his personal top ten (for \\"The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\\" poll), writing: \\"Pratidwandi sees Ray drop his early style for a gritty hand-held Godardian romp through ‚Äô70s Calcutta.

The origins of the persecution stem from a variety of Bah√° º√≠ teachings which are inconsistent with traditional Islamic beliefs, including the finality of Muhammad's prophethood, and the placement of Bah√° º√≠s outside the Islamic faith.Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.238 Thus, Bah√° º√≠s are seen as apostates from Islam, and, according to some Islamists, must choose between repentance and death. Bah√° º√≠ spokespeople, as well as the United Nations, Amnesty International, the European Union, the United States, and peer-reviewed academic literature have stated that the members of the Bah√° º√≠ community in Iran have been subjected to unwarranted arrests, false imprisonment, beatings, torture, unjustified executions, confiscation and destruction of property owned by individuals and the Bah√° º√≠ community, denial of employment, denial of government benefits, denial of civil rights and liberties, and denial of access to higher education. Historical context The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was established in 1863 by Bah√° ºu'll√°h in Iran. Eighty-nine percent of Iranians adhere to the Twelver branch of Shi ªa Islam, which holds as a core doctrine the expected advent of a messianic figure known as the Qa'im or as the Imam Mahdi. The B√°b claimed he was the Imam Mahdi and thus he had equal status to Muhammad with the power, which he exercised, to abrogate the final provisions of Islamic law. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, a B√°b√≠ who claimed to be the one foretold by the B√°b, claimed a similar station for himself in 1863 as a Manifestation of God and as the promised figure foretold in the sacred scriptures of the major religious traditions of the past and founded what later came to be known as the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Concerning the historical context of the persecutions, Friedrich W. Affolter in \\"War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity\\" writes: In addition to this, the B√°b√≠ religion, the forerunner of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, did not passively accept its persecution. Friedrich W. Affolter writes: Others have stated that the B√°b√≠s originally armed themselves and prepared for a holy war that became defensive when they encountered state troops in several locations and that two to three thousand B√°b√≠s were killed. Bah√° ºu'll√°h took a more conciliatory position, forbidding the use of holy war to spread his faith. Instead, he attempted to engage various governments in dialogue; however, the radical nature of his claim to prophethood did little to change the perception of the people of Iran. To this day, Bah√° º√≠s are a widely persecuted minority group in Iran and other predominantly Muslim countries, since they are seen as apostates from Islam, and supporters of the West and Israel. Iran =Legal context= The Iranian constitution that was drafted during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1906 set the groundwork for the institutionalized persecution of Bah√° º√≠s. While the constitution was modelled on Belgium's 1831 constitution, the provisions guaranteeing freedom of worship were omitted. Subsequent legislation provided some recognition to Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians as equal citizens under state law, but it did not guarantee freedom of religion and \\"gave unprecedented institutional powers to the clerical establishment.\\" The Islamic Republic of Iran, that was established after the Iranian revolution, recognizes four religions, whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Members of the first three minority religions receive special treatment under Iranian law. For example, their members are allowed to drink alcohol, and representatives of several minority communities are guaranteed seats in parliament. However, religious freedom in Iran is far from absolute. Conversion away from Islam (apostasy) is forbidden, with both converts and missionaries risking prison. Those seeking to start a new religious group (whether Muslim or not) face severe restrictions. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith faces an additional, technical hurdle. Iranian law recognizes all those who accept the existence of God and the prophethood of Muhammad as Muslims. Bah√° º√≠s accept both of these precepts; however, Bah√° º√≠s recognize the B√°b and Bah√° ºu'll√°h as additional messengers that have appeared after Muhammad. Muslims, on the other hand, assert the finality of Muhammad's revelation. Iranian law therefore treats Bah√° º√≠s as \\"heretics\\" rather than members of an independent religion, as they describe themselves. Other unrecognized Iranian religious minorities include the Ahl-e Haqq, the Mandaeans and Azalis. Non-Muslims comprise less than 1% of Iran's population. See religious minorities in Iran. =Early 20th century and the Pahlavi Dynasty= Political context At least one scholar has described Bah√° º√≠s in Iran prior to the Islamic Republic as \\"a political pawn\\". Government toleration of Bah√° º√≠s being in accord with secular Western ideas of freedom of worship was \\"a way of showing mullahs who was boss.\\" Correspondingly, since the Bah√° º√≠s were a relatively small minority and most Iranians followed traditional beliefs of Apostasy in Islam, when the government was politically weak and in need of clerical support, withdrawal of government protection to \\"allow active persecution of the Bah√° º√≠s,\\" was a \\"low cost pawn that could be sacrificed to the mullahs\\". Thus during the heyday of secular ruler Reza Shah Bah√° º√≠s were protected; while in 1955, when Reza Shah's son, Muhammad Reza, needed clerical support for the Baghdad Pact and with the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat only two years past, Bah√° º√≠s were attacked.Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.231 History Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression that impacted individual Bah√° º√≠s, centrally-directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bah√° º√≠ community and institutions were initiated. Some of these persecutions were recorded by missionaries who were in the areas at the time of the massacres. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bah√° º√≠s were killed. Later on Bah√° º√≠ schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girl's schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and '40s, Bah√° º√≠ marriages were not recognized and Bah√° º√≠ literature was censored. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, due to the growing nationalism and the economic difficulties in the country, the Shah gave up control over certain religious affairs to the clergy of the country. Among other things, the power sharing resulted in a campaign of persecution against the Bah√° º√≠s. Akhavi has suggested it is likely the government had hoped that by orchestrating a movement against the Bah√° º√≠s it could serve to obscure the fact that revenues obtained by the distribution of oil from western oil companies was going to be too low for the growing nationalistic sentiment; it would also serve to gain the support of the clergy for their foreign policy. They approved and coordinated the anti-Bah√° º√≠ campaign to incite public passion against the Bah√° º√≠s started in 1955 and included the spreading of anti-Bah√° º√≠ propaganda in national radio stations and official newspapers. During the month of Ramadan in 1955, Sheikh Mohammad Taqi Falsafi, a populist preacher, started one of the highest-profile anti-Bah√° º√≠ propaganda schemes. After receiving permission from the Shah to state anti-Bah√° º√≠ rhetoric in his sermons, he encouraged other clergy to discuss the Bah√° º√≠ issue in their sermons.Khatirat va Mubarizat-i Hojjatolislam Mohammad Taqi Falsafi [THE MEMORIES AND CAMPAIGNS OF HOJJATOL-ISLAM MOHAMMAD TAQI FALSAFI] (Ali Davani, ed., The Center for Islamic Revolution Documents, 2003) translated in These sermons caused mob violence against Bah√° º√≠s; Bah√° º√≠ properties were destroyed, Bah√° º√≠ centres were looted, Bah√° º√≠ cemeteries desecrated, Bah√° º√≠s were killed, some hacked to pieces, Bah√° º√≠ women were abducted and forced to marry Muslims, and Bah√° º√≠s were expelled and dismissed from schools and employment. During the third week of the sermons the National Bah√° º√≠ Centre in Tehran was occupied by the military and its dome later destroyed. The Minister of the Interior, Amir Asadollah Alam, wrote in his memoirs: : > Falsafi managed to fool both the Shah and the military authorities and start > a campaign against the Bah√° º√≠s that dragged the country to the edge of > disaster. It was Ramadan. [Falsafi's] noon sermons were broadcast throughout > the nation via radio and caused violence and terror in many locations. > People killed a few Bah√° º√≠s here and there. Falsafi justified these acts by > saying that they increased the Shah's prestige.

It is an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's 1882 play An Enemy of the People, and was released under that title in the UK. The cast includes Ray's favourite actor Soumitra Chatterjee, and veteran actors such as Dhritiman Chatterjee, Shubhendu Chatterjee, Manoj Mitra and Ruma Guhathakurta. Ray adapts the play to an Indian setting: a flourishing township in which a temple attracts devotees as well as tourists. When a health problem is discovered Dr Ashok Gupta, played by Soumitra Chatterjee, finds his popularity flagging. The film was screened out of competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Ashoke Gupta, played by Soumitra Chatterjee, an honest doctor, diagnoses the alarming spread of jaundice among his patients. To identify the cause, he analyses the water of a populated part of his town, Chandipur. According to the report, the holy water (charanamrita) of the Tripureshwar temple, a famous temple and tourist attraction of the town, is found to be contaminated due to damage to the underground piping system. The temple was the source of income for all of the corrupt politicians. Among these politicians is Dr. Gupta's younger brother, Nishith Gupta, portrayed by Dhritiman Chatterjee, who is also the chairman of the municipality. He and other beneficiaries of the temple decides to prevent the doctor from alerting the people. As a responsible member of society, the doctor tries to broadcast the fact of contamination to the people, proposing temporary closure of the temple for water purification. However the Chairman is absolutely against this idea as it tampers with their profits. They are not ready to accept scientific evidence and instead says charanamrita can never be contaminated because it is holy. He also tries to publish an essay in a local daily newspaper (Janabarta) on the topic. But the corrupt officials suppress his voice as the facts would inevitably decrease the temple's income. The newspaper rejects his essay, fearing political pressure and public rage. As the story progresses, Dr. Gupta even tries to convey his message in a public meeting. Unfortunately, it is infiltrated and messed up by his brother and his associates. The Chairman is able to manipulate the community against the doctor's attempts to save it. He faces a widespread angry response and he goes from being a leader of society to an enemy of the people. Dr. Gupta loses his job in the local hospital and his daughter is terminated from her post of a teacher. The landlord asks them to move out. However, at the end of the play Dr. Gupta gets justice. The young educated population of the town sides with him while his son-in-law's theatre troupe campaigns for him. The assistant editor of Janabarta quits his job to side with him and send his writing and interview to top newspapers in Kolkata. The film ends in Gupta family deciding to stay in Chandipur, amidst a shout of \\"Long Live Dr. Ashok Gupta!\\" around him.

Today, they work on the sidelines at sports events to provide water for athletes. The phrase has also been used to describe diminutive figures who serve another team or person in the business and political worlds, in a slightly derogatory manner (ex. \\"Bill is the CEO's water boy\\"). The position has a long history in athletics.

The water call given here (Example 14) was recorded In Alabama in 1950.\\" Early agricultural machinery also needed a water boy to supply water for cooling.

The directly opposing player is a centre half-back.Royce Hart of the Richmond Football Club and Wayne Carey of the North Melbourne and Adelaide football clubs are often considered to be two of the greatest centre half-forwards of all time.Royce Hart is the Centre Half Forward in the AFL team of the century The centre half-forward's role is usually the most demanding of any player on field, with a tall frame, strength and most importantly, athleticism, required. Usually the best backman will be used to cover a quality CHF, unless the opposing full-forward is so good they take priority. Thus, an attacking team with a solid combination of both centre half-forward and full-forward will seriously stretch a defence. If a team in the AFL played without a reliable centre half-forward, then they would often struggle to win games or make an impact on the competition. Great centre half- forwards have the ability to turn games on their heads and practically win a match singlehandedly for their team. A primary skill needed is good marking ability, with long-range goalkicking also being of great value. CHFs frequently line up shots on goal from about 50 metres out, often as wide as the boundary. At AFL level especially, kicking goals on-the-run while running into the 50-metre arc is a significant and requisite skill, as well as being able to pick out markers closer to the goal square. The position is very strenuous, and players who specialise as CHFs often have unnaturally shortened careers‚ÄîDermott Brereton is a good example of a great player worn out too quickly. In the modern game, coaches preserve these players, playing them in a variety of relief positions, often in the opposite position at centre half- back; this typically preserves the longevity of their career. A good example is James Hird, who often played on the half-back flank towards the end of his career. While others may only play in CHF only when there is a more senior full forward ahead of them in the depth chart.

The species is native to Central and South America. Small and arboreal, this species is characterized by a wide array of color variations, as well as the superciliary scales above the eyes. It is the most common of the green palm-pitvipers (genus Bothriechis), and is often present in zoological exhibits. The specific name schlegelii honors Hermann Schlegel, who was a German ornithologist and herpetologist.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Bothriechis schlegelii, p. 235). For other common names see below. No subspecies are currently recognized as being valid. Description The eyelash viper is a relatively small species of pitviper, with adults ranging from long, and females being longer and more variable in size than males, which can grow to long. It has a wide, triangular-shaped head, and eyes with vertical pupils. Like all pit vipers, it is solenoglyphous, having large, hypodermic needle-like fangs in the front of the upper jaw that fold back when not in use, and has heat sensitive organs, or pits, located on either side of the head between the eye and nostril. Its most distinguishing feature, and origin of its common name, is the set of modified scales above the eyes that look much like eyelashes. The eyelashes are thought to aid in camouflage, breaking up the snake's outline among the foliage where it hides. the eyelash viper occurs in a wide range of colors, including red, yellow, brown, green, even pink, as well as various combinations thereof. It often has black or brown speckling on the base color. No external features distinguish the two sexes. Common names Common names of B. schlegelii include the eyelash viper, eyelash pit viper, eyelash palm viper, eyelash palm-pitviper, Schlegel's viper, Schlegel's pit viper,Parker HW, Grandison AGC (1977). Snakes -- A Natural History. Second Edition. British Museum (Natural History) and Cornell University Press. 108 pp. 16 plates. LCCCN 76-54625. (cloth), (paper), Schlegel's palm viper,Brown JH (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . eyelash snake, eyelash lancehead, eyelash mountain viper, and horned palm viper. In Spanish, the primary language of countries comprising its distribution, common names include bocarac√°, oropel (golden morph), v√≠bora bocarac√°, toboba pestanas, v√≠bora de pesta√±as (eyelash viper), and serpiente loro (parrot snake). Geographic range The geographic range of B. schlegelii extends from southern Mexico (northern Chiapas), southeastward on the Atlantic plains and lowlands through Central America to northern South America in Colombia and Venezuela. It is also found on the Pacific versant and lowlands in parts of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It occurs in mesic forest at elevations almost from sea level to altitude. The type locality is ‚ÄúPopayan‚Äù (Popay√°n, Colombia). Habitat B. schlegelii prefers lower altitude, humid, tropical areas with dense foliage, generally not far from a permanent water source. One study noted the preference of B. schlegelii for deep, shady ravines. Behavior Like other Bothriechis members, B. schlegelii is arboreal and has a strong prehensile tail. It is largely nocturnal, consuming small rodents, frogs, lizards and small birds. It is not known to be an aggressive snake, but will not hesitate to strike if harassed. A typical ambush predator, it waits patiently for unsuspecting prey to wander by. Sometimes, it is known to select a specific ambush site and return to it every year in time for the spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated that B. schlegeli learns to improve strike accuracy over time. Sometimes B. schlegelii (especially juveniles) will employ what is known as ‚Äúcaudal luring‚Äù, wiggling the tail in worm-like motions to encourage potential prey to move within striking range. There is a myth among villagers in some small areas of South America that the eyelash viper will wink, flashing its \\"eyelashes\\" at its victim, following a venomous strike. Snakes are not physiologically capable of such behavior, as they have no eyelids and can not close their eyes.Goin CJ, Goin OB, Zug GR (1978). Introduction to Herpetology, Third Edition. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman and Company. xi + 378 pp. . (\\"Snakes ... glassy, unwinking glare\\", p. 53). Reproduction The eyelash viper reaches sexual maturity at around two years of age, and the ovoviviparous species reproduces throughout the year in warm environments. Females carry eggs for around six months before they hatch internally, where the young complete their development. Pregnant females have enlarged lower abdomens, and may stop eating in later stages of pregnancy. In a typical brood they give birth to 2‚Äì20 live young, which are in length and appear physically similar to adults. Males engage in a sometimes hours-long courtship ritual called a \\"dance of the adders\\", in which two males posture and intimidate one another in an upright, \\"cobra-like\\" stance until one is pushed away or falls to the ground. They are polygynous, and usually mate at night. Captivity Despite the inherent danger of its venom, B. schlegelii is frequently available in the exotic animal trade, and is well represented in zoos worldwide. It is frequently captive bred for color and pattern. Exporting from the wild is not as common as it once was, but is not unknown. In general they make hardy captives, readily feeding on provided mice. Taxonomy Some authorities also recognize a montane form that is treated either as a subspecies (B. s. supraciliaris) or as a species (B. supraciliaris). Found in the province of San Jos√© in Costa Rica, it was sometimes referred to as the eyelash mountain viper, while more recent publications recognizing the species designation refer to it as the blotched palm-pitviper. Conservation Eyelash vipers have not been evaluated by the IUCN Red List, and were removed from CITES Appendix III in 2002. While not listed as threatened, they could be at risk of habitat loss from increased deforestation for timber, agriculture, and urbanization.

National and All-American shared some ownership and advertised and co-branded their comics as if they were one company. They also collaborated on All Star Comics, an All-American publication which featured the Justice Society of America, a super hero team including characters from both companies' stables, e.g., The Spectre and Starman from National, The Flash and Green Lantern from All-American.

When the superhero genre faded in popularity in the late 1940s, DC Comics decided to focus more on other genres, such as science fiction, westerns, humor and romance. Leading Comics led the charge as the first DC title to drop its superheroes. With its Summer 1945 issue #15, Leading switched to funny animals, with the introduction of Nero Fox (a fox who was billed as the \\"jive-jumpin' emperor of ancient Rome\\"). In issue #23 (February‚ÄìMarch 1947), Nero Fox was dropped as the cover-featured first story in each issue, to be replaced by Peter Porkchops, a pig (created by Otto Feuer), in his first appearance. Peter appeared in Leading Comics (retitled Leading Screen Comics with #34 in 1948) regularly until issue #77 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1955).

It was isolated from the mold Penicillium citrinum by Akira Endo in the 1970s, and he identified it as a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, i.e., a statin. Mevastatin might be considered the first statin drug; clinical trials on mevastatin were performed in the late 1970s in Japan, but it was never marketed. The first statin drug available to the general public was lovastatin. Mevastatin has since been derivatized to the compound pravastatin, which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. In vitro, it has antiproliferative properties. A British group isolated the same compound from Penicillium brevicompactum, named it compactin, and published their results in 1976. The British group mentions antifungal properties with no mention of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. High doses inhibit growth and proliferation of melanoma cells.  Biosynthesis  Biosynthetic pathway Biosynthesis of mevastatin is primarily accomplished via a type 1 PKS pathway it proceeds in the PKS pathway as seen in figure 1 until it reaches a hexaketide state where it undergoes a Diels- Alder cyclization. After cyclization it continues via the PKS pathway to a nonaketide after which it is released and undergoes oxidation and dehydration. It is presumed that the oxidations are preformed by a polypeptide that is similar to cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which is encoded by mlcC within the mevastatin gene. Lastly the biosynthesis is completed by the PKS facilitating the addition of a diketide sidechain and a methylation by SAM. Figure 1 shows mevastatin in its acid form but it can also be in the more commonly seen lactone form. This pathway was first observed in Penicillium cilrinum and was later discovered that another type of fungus, Penicillium brevicompaetum also produced mevastatin via a PKS pathway.Lactone and acid form of mevastatin  Pharmacology  Sustained elevations of cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Mevastatin acts to lowers hepatic production of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. When hepatic cholesterol levels are decreased it causes an increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduces cholesterol levels in the circulation. It has also been shown that mevastatin upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.

The field umpire in the green uniform, Scott McLaren, is backing away from the contest after conducting the centre bounce. In Australian rules football, a ruckman or ruckwoman is typically a tall and athletic player who contests at centre bounces and stoppages (such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups). The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field. They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities (inside 50s). The role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out. The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins, the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally, so in this respect, the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre. The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms. Unlike rugby, the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates. Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman. With no offside or knock on rules, the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction. Before a bounce down or ball up, ruckmen confer with the onballers (rovers and ruck-rovers) to pre- determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team's advantage. The ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team. A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200 cm or 6'7. When a ruckman beats his opponent by contacting the ball, it is called a hit out and measured as a statistic and performance indicator of effective ruckwork. Although the ruckman is the primary player to score hit-outs, sometimes tall key position players fill in for the ruckman around the ground if the ruckman cannot run to make the contest in time. Rucking is one of the most physically demanding positions on the ground, both in terms of fitness and body contact. As a result of the high level of physical contact of clashing with opponents in the air, many ruckmen have large physiques or bulk up to prevent injury. As well, due to the use of knees when jumping, many ruckmen wear protective thigh and shin padding, whereas players in other positions rarely do. Coaches often field more than one ruckman and rotate them due to the physical pressure of the position and the endurance of having to run to ruck contests around the ground. Ruck styles Two ruckmen contest the bounce in a suburban western Sydney AFL game between the East Coast Eagles AFC and Campbelltown Kangaroos AFC Ruckmen are sometimes classified by their style of play, although many players alternate styles during a game based on strategy, the style of an opponent, their physical attributes and versatility. A tap ruckman (or palm ruckman) is the most skillful and high jumping of styles. Players using this style will deftly palm the ball directly down to the advantage of a smaller teammate or rover, often making their hitouts the most effective. WAFL and VFL great Polly Farmer is considered to be one of the best all-time ruckmen of this style.Bartley, Patrick Polly Farmer, trailblazer The Age 8 September 2010 The AFL's Aaron Sandilands is a good current example.Gleeson, Michael Sandilands too big, too strong, too good The Age 15 May 2009 A mobile ruckman (or mobile bigman) often describes a ruckman that covers a lot of ground. Sometime this type of ruckman is not as tall, as big, or effective at hit outs, but may possess a high leap and a greater athletic endurance. Against less mobile ruckman, this type of player can compensate with an ability to take more marks around the ground playing effectively as a tall ruck rover and sometimes with the additional ability to kick goals while playing from the midfield or drop back into defence when required. Jim Stynes was one of the first modern ruckmen in this mould.http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/jim-stynes-changed-the-game-of-afl-as-a- player-and-saved-melbourne-demons-as-president-eddie- mcguire/story-e6frf33l-1226305053433 A thump ruckman practices a more physical style of rucking. Typically, the player is of a larger and/or taller build and uses brute force (and a style often referred to as crash and bash) to take their opponent out of the contest and punch the ball forward, typically going for distance and penetration into their attacking zone. These players are typically slower around the ground, as such are sometimes referred to as dinosaurs and sometimes criticised for a lack of skill around the ground. This type of ruckwork is rarer in the modern game, more so at its highest level. At the beginning of 2003, the AFL rules were changed so that ruckman must stand at opposite sides and run towards each other. This change affected thump ruckmen especially. Strategies using ruckmen Ruckmen are often used by coaches strategically. =Attacking strategies= A Western Bulldogs player rises over the top of the two designated ruckman to employ a tandem ruckwork strategy in an AFL match at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne. women's game. Players surround the contest, waiting for the tap. Using tandem ruckmen, often known as third man up, is a tactic often employed around the ground as a set play strategy. As only one ruckman from each side can be used at centre bounces, this tactic is restricted to boundary throw-ins and bounces. It involves a second tall or high jumping player from one of the sides contesting the ruck, typically when the taller ruckmen are wrestling at ground level or consistently ineffective in getting a clear tap away. The tactic has become especially popular during the 2015 season. It often results in a thump forward to keep the ball moving towards goal, as it is difficult for the often shorter player contesting the ruck to aim a tap. This is because they are not able to be assisted by lifting and can often be put off balance in the air when jumping over the top of ruckmen. Additionally, by committing an extra player to the ruck contest, there is one less player from that team around the contest - though this can also have the effect of opening up space for more creative roving players. Some key position players are designated secondary ruckmen for boundary throw-ins and will sometimes be used in tandem ruckwork. During kick-ins the ruckman can sometimes be a designated target. With extra height it is difficult for opposition players to take marks against them and they are an easier target to spot in a cluster. In a contested situation, the ruckman may be instructed to bring the ball to ground, so that the smaller rovers or crumbers on their team know to attack the ball from front and square position to gain possession. Ruckmen are sometimes dropped into the goal square during an attack on goals from outside scoring distance. This way they become a tall marking target if a player decides to bomb a kick into the goal square. The term resting ruckman is used when a ruckman is played in the forward line between stints in the ruck. As the ruck requires almost constant running, resting in the forward line gives the ruckman much needed breaks and with their heights they do not need to run or lead as much into space to contest marks when the ball does reach the forward line. =Defensive strategies= Some coaches instruct ruckmen to drop back into the hole, which effectively is the open space in which a full-forward might lead. This way the tall player can cut off a low pass designed to hit a full-forward. Standing in the road of a large forward leading out at full speed requires a lot of courage. Ruckmen will sometimes be designated to stand the mark when an opposition takes a kick on goal. The extra height of the ruckman means that the player has to kick higher, meaning more chance of missing, dropping short or even the possibility of actually kicking into the man on the mark (called a smother). When an opposition player is having a set shot at goal, particularly from a long distance or on an acute angle, the ruckman may be instructed to run all the way to the goal square to protect it, temporarily playing a similar role to a goalkeeper in soccer or gaelic football. Despite no height limit for the goal, the ball will always have a curved trajectory and many kicks tend to drop short. Being the tallest player, it gives the ruckman the best opportunity of any player to touch the ball before it goes through the goal posts and create an obstacle in area of goal to kick through. This can result in a behind instead of a goal and save 5 points, or can remain in the field of play with no score. Ruck rules In 2004, a new centre circle rule was introduced to reduce the ruckman's run-up. The aim was to decrease the knee clashes and Posterior Cruciate Ligament injuries experienced by many ruckmen. The new rules favour taller players and those with vertical leap, and many mobile ruckman now find it difficult to contest. During the 2008 AFL season, the AFL introduced an additional two boundary umpires which many labelled the \\"quick throw-in\\" rule. Designed to make the game faster and more attractive for television viewers, this new rule had the unintended effect of many professional ruckmen no longer being able to contest boundary throw-ins. The practice of \\"third man up\\" was outlawed for the 2017 season and beyond, in order to protect ruckmen. A player from each team must be \\"nominated\\" at each ruck contest, and only the nominated players can contest the ruck. No other player may come into contact with the ball until it had been hit by either ruckman or until the ball hit the ground, or they will have a \\"Ruck Infringement\\" free kick given against them. Due to initial practice phase during the JLT Community Series, many free kicks were given against players who accidentally came into contact with the ball, especially when they were not watching the contest. A notable example of this was when Adelaide Crows player Dean Gore was penalised after the ball hit him before it had been cleared. Gore was facing away from the contest. As a direct result of this and other similar incidents, the AFL clarified the rule, so that if players genuinely contacted the ball by accident, with genuineness decided by the field umpire, a play on would be called Modern ruckmen Standing at 211 cm (6'11\\") tall, Aaron Sandilands (right) of the Fremantle Dockers makes for an effective ruckman. Examples of modern-day ruckmen in the Australian Football League include Todd Goldstein, Nic Naitanui, Max Gawn, Stefan Martin, Aaron Sandilands, Matthew Kreuzer and Sam Jacobs (footballer). Aaron Sandilands at 2.11m (6 ft 11 in) is the equal tallest (along with Peter Street and Mason Cox) ruckman in AFL/VFL history and is considered to be one of the most dominant ruckmen in the game.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/a-giant- among-ruckmen/story-e6frf9jf-1225861019118 Recruiting Due to the requirement for ruckmen to be very tall, in recent years clubs have often gone outside of the traditional junior football leagues to recruit ruckmen. Cameron Jackson was recruited by in the 1998 Rookie Draft after previously playing in the National Basketball League, but never played an AFL game. The selection of Dean Brogan by with the 26th selection in the 1999 AFL Draft was much more successful, with Brogan playing for Port for 12 seasons and playing 174 games, including the being a member of the winning 2004 AFL Grand Final team. He had previously won an NBL championship with the Adelaide 36ers.Port takes a punt on basketball star Other basketballers such as David Fanning (Cairns Taipans and ),AFL can't be the only game in town Daniel Bass (Metropolitan State University of Denver and ), Seamus McNamara (Marist College, TSV Dachau Spurs and ),Collingwood signs American rookie Alex Starling (Bethune-Cookman University and )Swans sign US basketballer Alex Starling and Ben Dowell (Santa Clara University and )Top tips to make smooth transition have all been recruited, but have not been as successful as Brogan in converting to Australian football at the AFL level. Another non-traditional recruit, Mike Pyke (Canada rugby union, US Montauban and Sydney), has enjoyed somewhat more AFL success than most of the aforementioned basketballers. The aforementioned Mason Cox (Oklahoma State University basketball and ) has also had a solid career to date, and is contracted to Collingwood through the 2020 season.

Genndy Tartakovsky, creator of Dexter's Laboratory and Samurai Jack, directed the animation for the pilot; this was not the only time he worked on a pilot created by Springer, as Tartakovsky also produced and directed Periwinkle Around the World. It was first aired in the United States on June 3, 2006, at 12:30 AM (EST) on Adult Swim. On June 18, 2006, Adult Swim ran a bumper announcing that Korgoth of Barbaria was officially picked up as a series, because of its critical and commercial success with garnering high ratings. Later events, including a formal petition to revive the showBring Back Korgoth of Barbaria on petitionhosting.com and an Adult Swim bumper announcement mentioning its cancellation, indicate that it was dropped before production began due to high production costs. Overview As of Comic-Con 2006 the show was scheduled to release sometime in spring of 2007. However, as of December 29, 2007, the only mention of the show on the Adult Swim website was an intro graphic with the words \\"you couldn't handle more than one anyway\\". Adult Swim re-aired the pilot episode on the night of October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised \\"Halloween Stunt\\" night, where rarely seen programs such as Welcome to Eltingville and Boo Boo Runs Wild were aired, rather than the usual programming line-up for a Friday evening. In November 2010, Adult Swim ran a bumper listing shows that were not picked up and brief reasons why. Korgoth was listed with the explanation \\"too expensive\\". Adult Swim re-aired the pilot (teased as a \\"surprise\\") on November 3, 2013, as a part of their Toonami block. Adult Swim re-aired the pilot again on January 29, 2019. Episode =Summary= From the Adult Swim website: : Korgoth of Barbaria followed the exploits of the eponymous Korgoth (voiced by actor Diedrich Bader), and parodied Conan the Barbarian, as well as the sword and sorcery subgenre in general. The show was set in a post-apocalyptic world where sorcery and the remnants of technology exist simultaneously. The heavy metal/thrash metal musical theme was composed by Lee Holdridge. =Plot= Korgoth is infected with a deadly parasite by Gog-Ma-Gogg and extorted to steal an item known as \\"The Golden Goblin of the Fourth Age\\" from the wizard Specules, who Gog believes to have recently died. He journeys with a group of Gog-Ma-Gogg's henchmen to Specules' castle, picking up a girl and killing several things along the way. The group reaches the castle and begin to plunder it. As Korgoth searches for the Golden Goblin, Specules returns, explaining that he was on vacation. Specules uses his magic to kill or incapacitate all but Korgoth, who proves too strong for the ridiculous creatures that the wizard conjures through chewing gum. As a last resort, Specules uses his magic directly against Korgoth; however, he is knocked off- balance and accidentally kills Korgoth's girl. Angered, Korgoth takes a two- pronged candle stick holder and impales Specules through the eyes, only to find that the wizard has magically transferred his head onto the dead girl's body. Specules proceeds to fly out the window. Korgoth returns to Gog-Ma-Gogg with the Golden Goblin (a simple novelty item) and gets the elixir for the deadly parasite, though the elixir takes many seasons to take effect. Korgoth is last seen walking away, pulling a cart full of medicine bottles.

The series first aired February 11, 2007 on Adult Swim. Described as \\"an ultra-patriotic Land of the Lost set in the center of the Earth\\", the series was directed by Tom Stern and stars Josh Gardner. Gardner is known for his previous collaboration with Stern on the television series, Gerhard Reinke's Wanderlust. Its theme song is performed by South Park creator Trey Parker. Lewis' primary inspirations behind this homage to 1970s-era Saturday morning live-action television were Sid and Marty Krofft (Land of the Lost), Doctor Who (Tom Baker-era), and the Planet of the Apes franchise. On October 31, 2008 Adult Swim ran a special Halloween marathon, consisting only of cancelled shows, featuring Saul of the Mole Men, confirming its cancellation. Plot A series promo featured brief introductions for the crew on the use of a subterranean drill module. The team, known as STRATA, included Captain Jim J. James, Lieutenant Jen E. James, Robot, Kiko the Mute Wildboy, and the \\"rest\\" of the STRATA action team (which included Saul Malone (Gardner) ‚Äì and Don Rogers). The main character, Saul, is seen in the background or blocked off by objects like a shovel or a flag during the promo. Following the promo, the crew is shown aboard STRATA's huge ship, which is burrowing deep under Earth's surface. Saul becomes the sole survivor of the main team when rocks begin pummeling the rest of the STRATA team, and crippling their ship; the only other survivors are a Robot controlled by a human brain, and the vapid pop musician Johnny Tambourine, who is conscious but trapped in a hibernation capsule. Saul soon finds himself in an underground world populated by \\"Mole Men\\" and \\"Bird Bats\\" as well as unexplained characters like \\"The Floating Pancake\\" and \\"Chinacula\\", a cape- wearing Chinese vampire. Though cut off from the surface world, Saul is elated, believing he will find evidence beneath the surface for his theory that there are sentient rocks descended from a huge \\"mother rock\\". Terrified by the Mole Men, Saul impulsively impales their king using the STRATA transmitter. The king eventually dies, touching off a power struggle between his two sons ‚Äì the older (but corpulent and corrupt) Bertrum Burrows, and the noble Clancy Burrows. Saul fails to get a proper signal to STRATA before the transmitter is destroyed. However, he does meet a talking rock, one he believes to be the Mother Rock. The intelligent stone inspires Saul to lead the Mole Men, who themselves are turning to a popular vote in search of a new king. Saul is easily defeated by both of the Burrows brothers, who themselves lose to a clueless Johnny Tambourine. As the series progresses, Saul is alternately challenged and befriended by Mole Men. Saul meets Fallopia, a female and one of the most horribly mutated of the Mole Men (when revealed, she actually appears to be a beautiful human woman). Though Fallopia becomes Saul's love interest, she betrays him when found in flagrante delicto with Johnny Tambourine. Eventually the plot links the Mother Rock, a war between mole men and bird bats and a prophecy involving magical gemstones, the end of the world and Benjamin Franklin. In the season 1 finale, Saul, Clancy, and Stromulus Guandor team up to defeat the Rock Assassins, which are actually Jim J. James and Jen. E. James' bodies with rock heads, who then combine to form a giant rock monster. With the combined talents of Stromulus' \\"Sonar of the Bird-Bats\\", Bertrum's\\"Mole Man Burrowing\\", and Saul's \\"Rock Master Tumble\\", they defeat the rock monster, and Saul's old captains die in peace ‚Äî only for Saul to confront Nathaniel Baltimore ‚Äî his arch rival from the Tallahassee Geological License Review Board ‚Äî who inexplicably appears. Suddenly, they find a spaceship, and everybody, including the floating pancake, clambers on. Clancy even allows Bertrum aboard, though how he survived the rock attack in the previous episode is never explained. Before they take off, Otnip ‚Äì the moss-covered devil of the Mole Men ‚Äì stops their ship. Clancy goes out in an apparent suicide mission to blow up Otnip and free the ship. The episode ends as the ship flies into outer space, and the team, led by Saul and Fallopia, with Bertrum, Stromulus, Mrs. Burrows, Li'l Burrows, Nathaniel Baltimore, the floating pancake, and Chinacula is renamed \\"Strata-Team Space\\". Thus ends the season. Advertisements began airing on Adult Swim advertising the show as STRATA instead of the original title, making the series appear much like . Subsequent advertisements, however, focus more on Saul and reveal the actual title of the show. Saul often refers to his home-town of Buffalo, New York and reveals that he studied geology. Saul's presence is largely funny because of his endearing use of Buffalo English. His love interest is introduced as a creature perceived by locals as hideous and nearly beaten to death by the Mole Men. The beating is interrupted and the creature is revealed to be the lovely Fallopia. The Mole Men's perception of Fallopia's appearance is not unlike the Twilight Zone episode \\"Eye of the Beholder\\".

Mbalax has its sacred origins in the Serer people's ultra-religious, ultra-conservative njuup music tradition‚Äîand their sacred ndut rite ceremonies.Sturman, Janet, The SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture, SAGE Publications (2019), p. 1926 (Retrieved 13 July 2019)Connolly, Sean, Senegal, Bradt Travel Guides (2009), p. 27, (Retrieved 13 July 2019) By the 1970s, it became a fusion with other popular music from the African diaspora, the West, and afropop such as jazz, soul, Latin, Congolese rumba, and rock blended with sabar, the traditional drumming and dance music of the Wolof of Senegal. The genre's name derived from accompanying rhythms used in sabar called mbalax. History and influence The traditional form of mbalax originated from the sabar, a Wolof genre that historically fused musical and cultural practices from different ethnic groups such as the Njuup, a religious Serer music. The popular dance form of mbalax developed in urban Senegal in the early 1970s. Like many other francophone West African countries the Senegalese popular music scene was partially influenced by soul, blues, jazz, R&B;, and rock from the United States, variet√© from France, Congolese rumba, and Latin pop from the Caribbean and New York (e.g., pachanga, son, charanga, salsa, and Latin jazz).In this mix of African diasporic sounds Senegalese fans and musicians wanted their own urban popular dance music so they began singing in Wolof (Senegal's lingua franca) instead of French, and incorporated rhythms of the indigenous sabar drum (see ManginMangin, Timothy R. \\"Notes on Jazz in Senegal.\\" Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies. Eds. O'Meally, Robert G., Brent Hayes Edwards and Farah Jasmine Griffin. New York City, Canada: Columbia University Press, 2004. 224-49. Print.). Dancers began using moves associated with the sabar, and tipping the singers as if they were traditional griots. Among the bands that played this new style, Etoile de Dakar (starring Youssou N'Dour and El Hadji Faye), and Raam Daan (starring Thione Seck), Xalam II, and Super Diamono. Since becoming popular, both Mbalax and its associated dance have spread to other regions such as Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast and France. This dissemination has come about through radio, audio cassettes and televised video clips. Mbalax instrumentation includes keyboards, synths and other electronic production methods. However, it is the Nder (lead drum), the Sabar (rhythm drum), and the Tama (talking drum) percussion, and widely influenced African and Arabic vocalistic stylings that continue to make Mbalax one of the most distinctive forms of dance music in west Africa and the diaspora. Jazz, Funk, Latin (especially Cuban) and Congolese pop music influenced the early sounds of Mbalax, today it is also influenced by RnB, Hip-Hop, Coup√©-D√©cal√©, Zouk and other modern Caribbean, Latin, and African pop musics. Mbalax artists frequently collaborate with artists from other genres, such as Viviane Ndour's work with Zouk star Philip Monteiro and French/Malian rap star Mokob√©. Perhaps the most well known collaboration of all was Youssou Ndour's huge hit with Neneh Cherry; 'Seven Seconds'. Mbalax dance Mbalax Dancing is popular in nightclubs and social gatherings as well as religious and life cycle events such as: weddings, birthdays, and naming ceremonies. The basic mbalax dancing involves pelvic gyrations and knee movements, but new movements arise as well, often associated with popular songs. Patricia Tang describes some of the new movements: > \\"Examples of such dances are the ventilateur ('electric fan', which > describes the motion of the buttocks swirling suggestively); xaj bi ('the > dog', in which a dancer lifts his/her leg in imitation of a dog); moulaye > chigin (which involves pelvic and knee movements that perfectly match the > sabar breaks); and more recently, the jelkati (a dance in which the upper > arms, bent at the elbows, move in parallel motion from left to right). All > of these dance crazes are closely tied to sabar breaks, and some (such as > tawran tej) are even named for the vocal mnemonics of the sabar rhythm they > accompany.\\" Music and instrumentation A talking-drum player with Youssou N'Dour Senegalese songs are usually unwritten, and certain instruments or musical styles are reserved for specific genders or age groups. In the past, only griots could perform music. Their traditional role was transmitting oral history, genealogies and social rankings, diplomacy, and storytelling. Today, griots continue to participate in naming ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. Music is performed using instruments such as drums, balafon, riti, Tama (talking drum), sabar drum. In the 1970s Western instruments and equipment such as the flute, electric guitar, piano, violin, trumpet and synthesizer have been incorporated into the music, to accompany the dance. In addition to the instrumentation, humming, chanting and singing (in either Wolof, French or English) are used to accompany the music that the dance is done to. The lyrics of mbalax songs address social, religious, familial, or moral issues. According to author Patricia Tang: > \\"The rhythmic foundation and primary identifiable feature of modern mbalax > is the sabar...in Wolof gewel percussionist parlance, mbalax literally means > 'accompaniment'. Within a sabar ensemble, different drums play different > roles, and mbalax refers to the accompaniment parts played by the mbeng- > mbeng. However, the mbalax part varies rhythmically from one dance to > another.

The process of Saranagati forms the basis of devotion to Godhead in the bhakti traditions within the Sri Sampradaya, propagated by Ramanujacharya (1017‚Äì1137 CE) and the Gaudiya Sampradaya, founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1482‚Äì1533 CE). Ramanuja considered surrender to Vishnu and His consort Lakshmi to be the highest goal of life, while Chaitanya emphasizes surrender to Krishna and His consort Radha as supreme. Spiritual initiation The formal ritual of Saranagati or Prapatti is a Vedic and Puranic, scriptural and tradition backed ritual called Pancha-Samskara or \\"the five impressions\\" and another name is Samashrayanam. The individual receives the following: * An initiation 'spiritual' name such as a name of Vishnu or one of his devotees such as Ramanujacharya, suffixed with the word dasa (meaning \\"servant\\" or servant of). Examples being Vishnu dasa, or Ramanuja dasa. (Nama samskara) * Tiruman or Tilaka on the forehead and 12 marks on certain parts of the body, which signifies that they belong to Vishnu and that their bodies, minds and Souls is the walking temple of Laxshmi-Narayana. (Pundra samskara) * Special branding on the shoulders of the Conch (Panchajanya) and Chakra or wheel (Sudarshana) of Vishnu by the guru. (Thapa samskara) * Learning to do Archana or Puja or ritual worship of Laxshmi-Narayana from the Guru. (Yajna samskara) * Learning three special mantras to Vishnu from the guru. (Mantra Samskara)* Sri Alavandhar Stotram/Stotra Ratnam by Bhagawad Sri Yamunacharya features following shloka which defines Saranagathi Na Dharma Nishthosmi Na Cha Atmavedi Na BhaktimansTvat Charanaravinde  Akinchanonanyagati Sharanyam Tvat Padamoolam Sharanam Prapadye  O Lord, I do not know Dharma, I do not know Dnyana, I do not have Bhakti in your divine Lotus Feet. All I have is I am Akinchan (one who does not have anything), and Ananyagati (One who is totally dependent ONLY on You). This akinchan and ananyagati soul is surrendered to your Lotus Feet. In Sri Bhagavadgeeta Bhagawan Sri Krishna explains Saranagati to Arjuna after explaining in detail Karma, Dnyana, Bhakti Yogas. Sri Bhagawadgeeta is a saar of all the vedas, upanishads, puranas. And The following shloka is a saar of Sri Bhagawadgeeta. This shloka being Saranagathi mantram offered by Lord Sri Krishna to Arjuna, it is regarded as one of the three divine mantras of Srivaishnavism. It is also called as Charam Mantra Sarva Dharmaan Parityajya Mamekam Sharanam Vraja Aham tva sarva papebhyo moksha ishyami ma shuchaha O Arjun, you relinquish all dharmas and surrender unto me. I shall deliver you from all the sins. Grieve not! Swami Sri Sitaramacharya (Vaikunth Mandap, Ayodhya) elaborated above charama shloka in Hindi Chhanda. Dharmo Me Sadhan Bhava Taji Kainkarya Ki Kari Bhavana Muzako Hi Sadhan Maani Raho Yadi Param Pad Hai Pavana Mat Prapti Pratibandhak Agho Se Avashi Tohi Chhudavunga Mati Shoch Nischaya Parampadmein bhi tumhe pachuchavunga Leave sadhan bhav (upaya bhava) in all the dharma or activities and treat them as bhagavad kainkarya (seva) received from Bhagawan. You treat Only ME as your Sadhan (Upay/Means) if you want to attain Param Padam. I will release you from everything that obstructs you from attaining ME (may that be Papa or Punya. Even those punya or sukrut which take us away from the Lord should be treated as Papa or Agha). Do not worry I Shall even carry you to the Param Pad Dham. Although often used interchangeably in common parlance, Saranagati is different from Prapatti. Saranagati refers to the seeking of God as the ultimate means for liberation, whereas Prapatti is the surrender of one's ego to receive the grace of God. The surrender of one's ego through Prapatti leads to the opening up of the grace of God whereas the invocation of the always freely available grace of God through prayer disarms one's resistance to goodness. Charama Sloka (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 66) describes Saranagati whereas the fourth injunction of Shri Krishna \\"Ma Namaskuru\\" (Prostrate to Me) in the previous verse (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 65) describes Prapatti. Prapatti is necessary at the end of all yoga practices because all of them boosts the ego by giving Siddhi-s (extraordinary powers or perfections) which prevents the merger of the individual consciousness with God consciousness. Renunciation of Siddhi-s leads to Kaivalyam, that is, Liberation (Patanjali Yoga Sutra-s 3.50-52). When Arjuna surrendered to Shri Krishna at the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita partly because of weakness, there was not much merit to deserve anything in return other than the teaching that would empower him, whereas after hearing the teaching and after practicing the yoga to fulfill his responsibilities that would earn him security, wealth, fame etc., he could offer something to receive the grace. However, since it is almost always practically impossible to practice Yoga well enough to become perfect in one lifetime because of the sinful tendencies accumulated over countless births, sufferings that are endemic in this world, and temptations that always distracts one from the path, and since it is difficult for a great personality like Arjuna to be humble, Shri Krishna offers unconditionally the ultimate option of Saranagati for release, which is the dependence on Him, Who is an infinite ocean of love, omnipotent and infallible. In practice In Sri Vaisnava Tradition Saranagati is divided into six divisions: #Accepting those things that are favorable for devotion to God (anukulyasya sankalpa) #Rejecting those things that are averse to surrender to God (pratikulyasya varjanam) #Considering God to be one's protector in all circumstances (raksisyatiti visvasa) #Accepting God as one's maintainer (goptrtve varanam) #Surrendering everything in God's service (atma- niksepa) #Cultivating a humble attitude (karpanya) In Goudiya Tradition Saranagati is Divided into ten Parts #Dainya #Atma Nivedana #Goptritve Varana #Avasya Raksibe Krsna Visvasa Palana #Bhakti Anukula Matra Karyera Svikara #Bhakti Pratikula Bhava Varjanangikara #Bhajan Lalasa #Siddhi Lalasa #Vijnapti #Sri Nama Mahatmya In ultimate vaishnavism sampradhya the nutshell is Saranagathi has 6 elements -5 angas & an angi # acknowledging ones helplessness # determination not to err again # vowing to follow rules #unshakeable faith that the Lord is the sole refuge #seeking the lord as protector *These are 5 angas *surrender itself in accordance with 5 angas is called angi Reference:The Hindu newspaper dated january08-Sunday-2017(article: tiruppavai lead us to sri vaikuntha)SpcialIssue vaikunta ekadasi References * Sri Vaishnavism: an Elementary treatise for beginners, published Sri Thillasthanam Swamy Kainkarya Sabha, Bangalore India & the Sri Vishishtadvaita Research Centre, Madras India Category:Vaishnavism Category:Bhakti movement ","title":"Saranagati"},{"id":"3384994","text":"A war novel or military fiction is a novel about war.

Origins Battle of Waterloo 1815 The war novel's origins are in the epic poetry of the classical and medieval periods, especially Homer's The Iliad, Virgil's The Aeneid, sagas like the Old English Beowulf, and Arthurian literature. All of these epics were concerned with preserving the history or mythology of conflicts between different societies, while providing an accessible narrative that could reinforce the collective memory of a people. Other important influences on the war novel included the tragedies of dramatists such as Euripides, Seneca the Younger, Christopher Marlowe, and Shakespeare. Euripedes' The Trojan Women is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war's horrors, apparently critical of Athenian imperialism.Moses Hadas, Ten Plays by Euripides, Bantam Classic (2006), page 195 Shakespeare's Henry V, which focuses on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt (1415) during the Hundred Years' War, provides a model for how the history, tactics, and ethics of war could be combined in an essentially fictional framework. Romances and satires in Early Modern Europe, like Edmund Spenser's epic poem The Faerie Queene and Miguel de Cervantes's novel Don Quixote, to name but two, also contain elements that influenced the later development of war novels. In terms of imagery and symbolism, many modern war novels (especially those espousing an anti-war viewpoint) are influenced by Dante's depiction of Hell in the Inferno, John Milton's account of the war in Heaven in Paradise Lost, and the Apocalypse as depicted in the biblical Book of Revelation. A Notable non-western example of war novel is Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms. As the realistic form of the novel rose to prominence in the seventeenth century, the war novel began to develop its modern form, although most novels featuring war were picaresque satires rather than truly realistic portraits of war. An example of one such work is Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen's Simplicius Simplicissimus, a semi- autobiographical account of the Thirty Years' War. 19th century war novels The war novel came of age during the nineteenth century, with works like Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma (1839), which features the Battle of Waterloo, Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace (1869), about the Napoleonic Wars in Russia, and Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (1895), which deals with the American Civil War. All of these works feature realistic depictions of major battles, scenes of wartime horror and atrocities, and significant insights into the nature of heroism and cowardice, as well as the exploration of moral questions. World War I and World War II World War I produced an unprecedented number of war novels, by writers from countries on all sides of the conflict. One of the first and most influential of these was the 1916 novel Le Feu (or Under Fire) by the French novelist and soldier Henri Barbusse. Barbusse's novel, with its open criticism of nationalist dogma and military incompetence, initiated the anti-war movement in literature that flourished after the war. Of equal significance is the autobiographical work of Ernst J√ºnger, In Stahlgewittern (1920) (Storm of Steel). Distinctly different from novels like Barbusse's and later Erich Maria Remarque's Im Westen nichts Neues (All Quiet on the Western Front), J√ºnger instead writes of the war as a valiant hero who embraced combat and brotherhood in spite of the horror. The work not only provides for an under-represented perspective of the War, but it also gives insight into the German sentiment that they were never actually defeated in the First World War. The post-1918 period produced a vast range of war novels, including such \\"home front\\" novels as Rebecca West's The Return of the Soldier (1918), about a shell shocked soldier's difficult re- integration into British society; Romain Rolland's Cl√©rambault (1920), about a grieving father's enraged protest against French militarism; and John Dos Passos's Three Soldiers (1921), one of a relatively small number of American novels about the First World War. Also in the post‚ÄìWorld War I period, the subject of war tis dealt with in an increasing number of modernist novels, many of which were not \\"war novels\\" in the conventional sense, but which featured characters whose psychological trauma and alienation from society stemmed directly from wartime experiences. One example of this type of novel is Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1925)', in which a key subplot concerns the tortuous descent of a young veteran, Septimus Warren Smith, toward insanity and suicide. In 1924, Laurence Stallings published his autobiographical war novel, Plumes. The 1920s saw the so-called \\"war book boom,\\" during which many men who had fought during the war were finally ready to write openly and critically about their war experiences. In 1929, Erich Maria Remarque's Im Westen nichts Neues (All Quiet on the Western Front) was a massive, worldwide bestseller, not least for its brutally realistic account of the horrors of trench warfare from the perspective of a German infantryman. Less well known but equally shocking in its account of the horrors of trench warfare is the earlier Stratis Myrivilis' Greek novel Life in the Tomb, which was first published in serialised form in the weekly newspaper Kambana (April 1923 ‚Äì January 1924), and then in revised and much expanded form in 1930. Also significant were Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms (1929), Richard Aldington's Death of a Hero (1929), Arnold Zweig's Der Streit un den Sergeanten Grischa (1927) (The Case of Sergeant Grischa), Charles Yale Harrison's Generals Die in Bed (1930). and William March's Company K (1933). Battle of Britain (1941), Paul Nash Novels about World War I appeared less in the 1930s, though during this decade historical novels about earlier wars became popular. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind (1936), which recalls the American Civil War, is an example of works of this trend. William Faulkner's The Unvanquished (1938) is his only novel that focuses on the Civil War years, but he deals with the subject of the long, aftermath of it in works like The Sound and the Fury (1929) and Absalom, Absalom! (1936). The 1990s and early 21st century saw another resurgence of novels about the First World War, with Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy: Regeneration (1991), The Eye in the Door (1993), and The Ghost Road (1995), and Birdsong (1993) by English writer Sebastian Faulks, and more recently Three to a Loaf (2008) by Canadian Michael Goodspeed. =World War II = World War II gave rise to a new boom in contemporary war novels. Unlike World War I novels, a European-dominated genre, World War II novels were produced in the greatest numbers by American writers, who made war in the air, on the sea, and in key theatres such as the Pacific Ocean and Asia integral to the war novel. Among the most successful American war novels were Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny, James Jones's From Here to Eternity, and Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls, the latter a novel set in the Spanish Civil War. Among more recent European novels is \\"Ukraine - In the Time of War\\", by Sonia Campbell-Gillies which has seen a sudden upsurge in demand since the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Ukraine's war-torn history is mirrored in the struggle for survival, freedom and independence of a boy during war. Ukrainian literature is scarce since the Ukrainian language was banned during occupation by various forces. Jean-Paul Sartre's novel Troubled Sleep (1949) (originally translated as Iron in the Soul), the third part in the trilogy Les chemins de la libert√©, The Roads to Freedom, \\"depicts the fall of France in 1940, and the anguished feelings of a group of Frenchmen whose pre-war apathy gives way to a consciousness of the dignity of individual resistance - to the German occupation and to fate in general - and solidarity with people similarly oppressed.\\"Random House blurb The previous volume Le sursis (1945, The Reprieve, explores the ramifications of the appeasement pact that Great Britain and France signed with Nazi Germany in 1938. Another significant French war novel was Pierre Boulle's Le Pont de la rivi√®re Kwa√Ø (1952) (The Bridge over the River Kwai). He served as a secret agent under the name Peter John Rule and helped the resistance movement in China, Burma and French Indochina. War is a constant and central theme of Claude Simon (1913 ‚Äì 2005), the French novelist and the 1985 Nobel Laureate in Literature: \\"It is present in one form or another in almost all of Simon's published works, \\"Simon often contrasts various individuals' experiences of different historical conflicts in a single novel; World War I and the Second World War in L'Acacia (which also takes into account the impact of war on the widows of soldiers); the French Revolutionary Wars and the Second World War in Les G√©orgiques.\\"John Sturrock, \\"Obituary\\" The Guardian, 11 July, 2005 He served in the cavalry in 1940 and even took part in an attack on horseback against tanks.John Sturrock, \\"Obituary\\" \\"The finest of all those novels is the one in which his own brief experience of warfare is used to tremendous effect: La Route Des Flandres (The Flanders Road, 1960) [...] There, war becomes a metaphor all too suitable for the human condition in general, as the forms and protocols of the social order dissolve into murderous chaos.'\\"John Sturrock, \\"Obituary\\" French philosopher and novelist, Bomb damage in London, England during World War II The bombing of London in 1940-1 is the subject of three British novels published in 1943; Graham Greene's The Ministry of Fear, James Hanley's No Direction, and Henry Green's Caught.Bergonzi, Bernard, War and Aftermath: English Literature and its Background 1939-60. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 29. Greene's later The End of the Affair (1951) is set mainly during the flying bomb raids on London of 1944.Bergonzi, Bernard, War and Aftermath, p. 89. According to Bernard Bergonzi \\"[d]uring the war the preferred form of new fiction for new fiction writers [in Britain] was the short story\\".Bergonzi, Bernard, War and Aftermath, p. 40. Although John Cowper Powys's historical novel Owen Glendower is set in the fifteenth century historical parallels exist between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the late 1930s and early 1940s: \\"A sense of contemporataneousness is ever present in Owen Glendower. We are in a world of change like our own\\".Herbert Williams, John Cowper Powys (Brigend: Seren,, 1997), p.126. The novel was conceived at a time when the \\"Spanish Civil WarOn the April 26, 1937, two days after Powys began his novel, the Spanish town of Guernica, was bombed by the Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. It inspired the painting Guernica by Pablo Picasso. was a major topic of public debate\\" and completed on 24 December 1939, a few months after World War II had begun.Charles Lock, \\"Owen Glendower and the Dashing of Expectations\\". The Powys Journal, vol. XV, 2005, p.71. In the \\"Argument\\" that prefaced the (American) first edition of 1941, Powys comments \\"the beginning of the fifteenth century [‚Ä¶] saw the beginning of one of the most momentous and startling epochs of transition that the world has known\\".p.x. This was written in May 1940, and \\"[t]here can be no doubt\\" that readers of the novel would have \\"registered the connection between the actions of the book and the events of their own world\\".W. J. Keith, Aspects of John Cowper Powys's 'Owen Glendower' , p.69. Fair Stood the Wind for France is a 1944 novel by H. E. Bates, which is concerned with a pilot of a Wellington bomber, who badly injures his arm when he brings his plane down in German- occupied France at the height of the Second World War. Eventually he and his crew make the hazardous journey back to Britain by rowing boat, bicycle and train. Bates was commissioned into the Royal Air Force (RAF) solely to write short stories, because the Air Ministry realised that the populace was less concerned with facts and figures about the war, than it was with reading about those who were fighting it. British novelist Evelyn Waugh's Put Out More Flags (1942) is set during the \\"Phoney War\\", following the wartime activities of characters introduced in his earlier satirical novels, and Finnish novelist V√§in√∂ Linna's The Unknown Soldier (1954) set during the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union telling the viewpoint of ordinary Finnish soldiers. Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy, Men at Arms (1952), Officers and Gentlemen (1955) and Unconditional Surrender (1961) (published as The End of the Battle in the US), loosely parallel Waugh's experiences in the Second World War. Waugh received the 1952 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Men at Arms. Elizabeth Bowen's The Heat of the Day (1948) is another war novel. However, even though events occur mainly during World War II, the violence of war is usually absent from the narration: \\"two years after the Blitz, Londoners, no longer traumatised by nightly raids, were growing acclimatised to ruin.\\"Ellmann, 152. Rather than a period of material destruction, war functions instead as a circumstance that alters normality in people‚Äôs lives. Stella confesses to Robert: \\"‚Äòwe are friends of circumstance‚éØwar, this isolation, this atmosphere in which everything goes on and nothing's said.\\"Heat of the Day, 210 There are, however, some isolated passages that deal with the bombings of London:Heat of the Day, 98 More experimental and unconventional American works in the post-war period included Joseph Heller's satirical Catch-22 and Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, an early example of postmodernism. Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, Irwin Shaw's The Young Lions, and James Jones' The Thin Red Line, all explore the personal nature of war within the context of intense combat. The English Patient is a 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel by Canadian novelist Michael Ondaatje. The book follows four dissimilar people brought together at an Italian villa during the Italian Campaign of World War II. The four main characters are: an unrecognisably burned man‚Äîthe titular patient, presumed to be English; his Canadian Army nurse, a Sikh British Army sapper, and a Canadian thief. The story occurs during the North African Campaign and is about the incremental revelations of the patient's actions prior to his injuries and the emotional effects of these revelations on the other characters. The decades following World War II period also saw the rise of other types of war novel. One is the Holocaust novel, of which Canadian A.M. Klein's The Second Scroll, Italian Primo Levi's If This is a Man and If Not Now, When?, and American William Styron's Sophie's Choice are key examples. Another is the novel of internment or persecution (other than in the Holocaust), in which characters find themselves imprisoned or deprived of their civil rights as a direct result of war. An example is Joy Kogawa's Obasan, which is about Canada's deportation and internment of its citizens of Japanese descent during World War II. Again, the life story of a Ukrainian boy who is at first interned in a labour camp and then drafted to fight for Russia is depicted in UKRAINE - In the Time of War, by Sonia Campbell-Gillies is an unusual historical novel that deals with the life of children during that period of war. South Korean refugees mid-1950 Almost immediately following World War II was the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953). The American novelist's Richard Hooker's MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors is a black comedy set in Korea during the war; it was made into a movie and a successful television series. In his ‚ÄúA World Turned Colder: A Very Brief Assessment of Korean War Literature‚Äù, Pinaki Roy attempted in 2013 to provide a critical overview of the different publications, principally novels, published on the war.The Atlantic Literary Review Quarterly 14 (3), July‚ÄìSeptember 2013, pp. 39-53) Vietnam and later wars After World War II, the war that has attracted the greatest number of novelists is the Vietnam War. Graham Greene's The Quiet American was the first novel to explore the origins of the Vietnam war in the French colonial atmosphere of the 1950s. Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried is a cycle of Vietnam vignettes that reads like a novel. The Sorrow of War by Bao Ninh is a poignant account of the war from the Vietnamese perspective.For a critical overview of the different Vietnam War novels written or translated into English, see Pinaki Roy's \\"The Minds at War: Sensibilities in Select Vietnam War Novels\\", published in The Atlantic Literary Review Quarterly International (Vol. 9, No. 4, October‚ÄìDecember 2008, pp. 121‚Äì37, ; ). In the wake of postmodernism and the absence of wars equalling the magnitude of the two world wars, the majority of war novelists have concentrated on how memory and the ambiguities of time affect the meaning and experience of war. In her Regeneration Trilogy, British novelist Pat Barker reimagines World War I from a contemporary perspective. Ian McEwan's novels Black Dogs and Atonement take a similarly retrospective approach to World War II, including such events as the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940 and the Nazi invasion of France. The work of W. G. Sebald, most notably Austerlitz, is a postmodern inquiry into Germany's struggle to come to terms with its troubled past. Some contemporary novels emphasize action and intrigue above thematic depth. Tom Clancy's The Hunt for Red October is a technically detailed account of submarine espionage during the Cold War, and many of John le Carr√©'s spy novels are basically war novels for an age in which bureaucracy often replaces open combat. Another adaptation is the apocalyptic Christian novel, which focuses on the final showdown between universal forces of good and evil. Tim LaHaye is the author most readily associated with this genre. Many fantasy novels, too, use the traditional war novel as a departure point for depictions of fictional wars in imaginary realms. Iran‚ÄìIraq War was also an interesting case for novelists. Events and memoirs of Iran‚ÄìIraq War has led to unique war novels. Noureddin, Son of Iran and One Woman‚Äôs War: Da (Mother) are among the many novels which reminds the horrible situation of war. Many of these novels are based on the interviews performed with participants and their memoirs. The post 9/11 literary world has produced few war novels that address current events in the War on Terrorism. One example is Chris Cleave's Incendiary (2005), which made headlines after its publication, for appearing to anticipate the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

He is currently a solo artist. Career A native New Yorker born in Brooklyn, New York, he barely spoke Spanish when he auditioned for a spot in the band Menudo after seeing a television commercial in Puerto Rico during a family vacation. After almost three years with Menudo, Garc√≠a parted with the band and signed on with World Wide Entertainment. As a solo artist he recorded several songs including \\"Magic\\", \\"Yours So Completely\\", and a remake of singer Tiffany's hit song \\"Could've Been\\" but it was his single \\"Don't Keep Me Holding On\\" (written and produced by Lewis Martine√© of Expos√© fame) that became a success. In 1992, World Wide Entertainment sold Garc√≠a's recording contract to Warner Bros. Records for an undisclosed amount. After parting with his former label, he released one semi-successful Spanish-language album for Warner simply titled \\"Angelo\\". After completing his secondary education and some music projects, he put his recording career on hold after he moved to Orlando, Florida, where he earned a communications degree from the University of Central Florida. After completing his studies, he helped in the launch of a women's gym franchise in Miami called Elements, before returning to New York City to restart his musical career.Ex-Menudo Member Is In His \`Elements from The Miami Herald, 30 January 2005 Since 2004, Garc√≠a has written a number of original songs in both Spanish and English. During 2005, he participated in a reunion tour of former Menudo members Sergio Blass, Rawy Torres, and Robert Avellanet, performing under the name \\"Los Ultimos Heroes.\\" In order to preserve his artistic independence and avoid a clich√©d reworking of the Menudo sound, Garc√≠a instead decided to record a solo album, using music he had personally written or collaborated on. In 2006, Garc√≠a released a Spanish- language pop album titled Cool for which he wrote or co-wrote every song. One of the singles from Cool, a ballad entitled \\"Entregar√©\\" (also known as \\"Si Es As√≠\\"), which Garc√≠a co-wrote with songwriter Roy Tavare, was featured in the 2006 motion picture Yellow starring Roselyn S√°nchez. In 2012, Garc√≠a began recording material for an English-language album, which is expected to be released in early 2013. In May 2010, Garc√≠a posed for a series of semi-nude photographs for Paragon Men, a gay erotica website.2010 Paragon Men-Spotlight: Angelo Garcia from www.paragonmen.com May 2010 In the interview which accompanied his photo shoot, Garcia openly discussed his homosexuality and his years of sexual self-exploration after leaving Menudo, even working briefly as a stripper and erotic dancer and performing at the now defunct Gaiety Theatre in New York City. He also refused to \\"out\\" his former bandmate Ricky Martin, who publicly disclosed his homosexuality a few weeks after Garc√≠a's interview. In 2012, Garcia joined forces with William Luque (who wrote his first Spanish hit \\"En Mis Sue√±os\\" which sold over 6 million copies worldwide) and began writing and recording a new English language dance-pop album in Madrid called Scandalous. The title track \\"Scandalous\\" speaks about a child growing up in the spotlight and how having to grow up prematurely wreaked havoc on his adult life.

China is the earliest country to manufacture and use musical chimes. They are also called Chime Bells. These sets of chime bells were used as polyphonic musical instruments and some of these bells have been dated at between 2,000 to 3,600 years old. They were hung in a wooden frame and struck with a mallet. Using a wooden hammer and a rod to beat the bronze bell can make different pitch. Along with the stone chimes called bianqing, they were an important instrument in China's ritual and court music going back to ancient times. Several sets of bianzhong were imported to the Korean court during the Song Dynasty. Pronounced in Korean as pyeonjong, the instrument became an important part in Korea's ritual and court music and is still in use. In Vietnam, the instrument, which was used in ceremonies in the court at Hu·∫ø, is called bi√™n chung. The instrument's name is pronounced hensh≈ç in Japanese.  History  While the oldest clapperless bells in China date to as early as 2100 BCE, the organization of zhong bells into bianzhong (literally ‚Äúarranged zhong‚Äù) developed in the Zhou dynasty (1046‚Äì256 BCE). Bianzhong from this era had varied numbers of individual zhong (between 13 and 64), each of which could produce two distinct pitches and were suspended obliquely or vertically. In ancient China, the chime was a special instrument for upper class people and it was a symbol of power and wealth. In one set from this time period, the biggest bell was 153.4 centimeters (60.4 in) in height and weighed 203.6 kilograms (449 lb), while the smallest bell was 20.4 centimeters (8.0 in) in height and weighed 2.4 kilograms (5.3 lb). The instrument‚Äôs construction shifted dramatically in the Qin and Tang dynasties (221 BC ‚Äì 907 BC). Bianzhong decreased in size during this period, being limited to sets of 14, 16, and 24 bells. Due to differences in bell construction, each zhong produced only one pitch. These bianzhong were tuned either to a seven-note scale or in twelve semitones. Musicians standardized bianzhong construction and ritual performance by the end of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279 CE). Typical instruments from this period consisted of 16 bells suspended vertically in a two-tiered frame. Through the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911 CE) into the modern day, this construction of bianzhong remained standard. In the modern day, Confucian ritual celebrations in Korea still utilizes bianzhong. The instrument's role is to lead the orchestra (doubling the melody of the winds and strings), while larger bells punctuate hymn phrases. Since the rediscovery of Zhou-dynasty bianzhong by archaeologists in 1978, there has been a revitalization of the performance and construction of that form of the instrument. Modern historical-performance ensembles (such as the Hubei Song and Dance Ensemble) have been performing on reconstructions of Zhou-dynasty bianzhong nationally and internationally since the 1980s.Korean pyeonjong ‚Äì Confucian ritual at Munmyo Shrine, Sungkyunkwan seowon Close-up of the bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng  Structure  The bianzhong was part of a larger category of ancient Chinese bells referred to as a zhong. This is defined by a leaf-shaped cross-section, concave mouth (or rim) and an overall shape expands slightly from top to bottom. All sets of bianzhong were suspended together in a wooden frame, but how they were suspended can differ. The most common type of suspension in the zhong family is when the bell has an elongated handle with a small ring at its base and is then hung at a diagonal angle. Some bianzhong have been found to be suspended vertically by a loop, but this is found less frequently. Each bianzhong has the same thickness, which means that the pitch is determined by size. The general range of bianzhong height is ; however, archaeologists have discovered some that are as small as and as large as . Individual bianzhong usually have many decorative features; these could include raised rectangular ribs, repetitive claw-like (or horn-like) designs, and protrusions in clusters (typically four clusters). Archaeology Among the most important sets of bianzhong discovered are a complete ceremonial set of 65 zhong bells, found in a near-perfect state of preservation during the excavation of the tomb of Marquis Yi, who died ca. 430 BCE.Warring States Tomb of Marquis Yi Yi was the ruler of Zeng, one of the minor states under control of the major State of Chu. This region is now part of the present-day Hubei province. The instrument is currently on display at the Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, China. It under protection by the government as an esteemed cultural relic, and has been performed on three times since its excavation in 1978, the most recent being for the Hong Kong Reunification ceremony in 1997. Although tuned bells have been created and used for musical performance in many cultures, zhong are unique among all other types of cast bells in several respects. They have a lens-shaped (rather than circular) section, the bell mouth has a distinctive \\"cutaway\\" profile, and the outer surfaces of the large bells feature 36 studs or bosses, symmetrically placed around the body in four groups of nine. This special shape gives zhong bells the remarkable ability to produce two different musical tones, depending on where they are struck. Striking the center of the bell produces the primary tone, while the left or right corners produce a secondary pitch either a major or minor third higher, equivalent to a distance of four or five notes on a piano.Alan Thorne & Robert Raymond, Man On The Rim: The Peopling of the Pacific (ABC Books, 1989), pp.166‚Äì67 The bells of Marquis Yi cover a range of five octaves, and are fully chromatic in the central three octaves. The set‚Äîstill in playable condition after almost 2,500 years‚Äîis able to produce both diatonic and pentatonic scales.Cultural China website -- \\"Bronze Chime Bells of Marquis Yi\\" Marquis Yi bianzhong on display in the Hubei Provincial Museum Bronze Zhong Bell from Spring and Autumn period; excavated in 1978 from the storage pit in Taigongmiao village, Baoji city, Shaanxi provinceThe bianzhong chimes of Marquis Yi are mounted on intersecting racks set at 90 degrees to each other, consisting of two pairs of massive wooden beams, with three smaller beams (carrying the highest bells) mounted on top of the upper beams. The beams are separated and supported at their ends and intersections by six bronze human figurines with upraised arms and wearing swords; the upper three figures are slightly smaller than the lower, which are cast on their own elaborately decorated bronze pedestals. The ends and intersection of each pair of beams are fitted with decorated bronze caps and front part of the brackets supporting the largest bells are cast in the shape of animals. The longer pair of main beams are provided with extra support in the middle in the form of two slender bronze columns.Musicians performing on a modern replica of Marquis Yi's bell set in Hubei Provincial Museum In 1992, Ma Chengyuan, director of the Shanghai Museum, purchased the 3,000-year-old Jin Hou Su bianzhong (Êôâ‰æØÁ©åÈêò) from the Hong Kong antique market.

In his lengthy career, he wrote and drew for British comics; wrote more than fifty books on the creators, performers, characters and history of popular media; devised, compiled and contributed to popular programmes for radio and television; and directed several short films. Gifford was also a major comics collector, owning what was perhaps the largest collection of British comics in the world. Gifford's work in the history of film and comics, particularly in Britain, provided an account of the work in those media of previously unattempted scope, discovering countless lost films and titles and identifying numerous uncredited creators. He was particularly interested in the early stages in film and comics history, for which records were scarce and unreliable, and his own vast collection was an invaluable source. Gifford produced detailed filmographies of every traceable fiction, non-fiction and animated film ever released in the UK, and of early animated films in the US. He compiled the first comics catalogue attempting to list every comic ever published in the UK, as well as the first price guide for British comics. His research into the early development of comics and cinema laid the groundwork for their academic study, and his reference works remain key texts in the fields. Gifford was also a cartoonist and comic artist who worked for numerous titles, mostly for British comics in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Although these were largely humour strips, he worked in a range of genres including superhero, Western, science fiction and adventure. Early life: 1927‚Äì48 Gifford was born in Forest Hill, London, the only son of William Gifford, a printer, and Amelia n√©e Hutchings. He grew up in the prosperous South London suburb of Sydenham, but was evacuated during the war to Tonbridge, Kent. Gifford attended the South London private school Dulwich College (1939‚Äì44), and while a pupil there was an avid comic collector and cartoonist. He produced a comic, The Junior, using heated gelatine and hectograph ink, which he sold for 1d around the school, but had published comics art by the time he was 14 (1942). Gifford became friends with Bob Monkhouse, a Dulwich schoolmate, fellow schoolboy cartoonist and later TV comedian and presenter, who studied in the year below and also had cartoons published while at the school. Gifford and Monkhouse collaborated on comics writing and drawing, a partnership that was to continue for many years in various forms, including as radio scriptwriters. The two toured together as a comedy act in the south east of England in the late 1940s with Ernie Lower's West Bees Concert Party, giving charity performances with Monkhouse as the 'straight man'. Gifford continued drawing during National Service in the Royal Air Force (1946-8), in which he served in the clerical position of 'AC1 Clerk/Pay Accounts', and went on to draw the Telestrip cartoon for the London Evening News. Comic art and comic writing: 1942‚Äì82 Gifford's prolific career as a cartoonist included both newspaper strips and comics, almost entirely for British publishers. His first published work was Magical Monty for All-Fun Comics (1942) at the age of 14, with a contribution to The Dandy the same year, and briefly worked as junior cartoonist for the newspaper Reynold's News (1944‚Äì45). He collaborated on comics writing and drawing with school friend Bob Monkhouse while they were still pupils at Dulwich College together. After his National Service, Gifford drew the Telestrip cartoon for the London Evening News, continuing in Rex magazine (1971‚Äì72), and on bubblegum and cigarette sweet packets. Other newspaper strips were produced by Gifford for Empire State News and Sunday Dispatch. Gifford's early work was with D.C. Thomson and the majority of his work was for humour strips, but he went on to cover various genres and styles, including adventure, detective, science fiction, Western and superheroes. Gifford was most productive as a comics artist in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. By the early 1970s Gifford's writing career, mainly on the subjects of comics and film history, began to take over from his work as a cartoonist in his own right. =Drawing style= Gifford had a distinctive, simple drawing style with a light-heartedness evident even in more action-orientated strips. Panels were often bustling and dynamic, with individual characters vying for attention. His humours strips were dense with conspicuously labelled puns and 'sight gags', the \\"visual conventions\\" of comic art, informed by an intense awareness of the cultural heritage of the medium. In the period Gifford drew for them, D.C. Thomson and most British comic publishers had a strict policy that artists could not sign their work but exceptionally, he was allowed to clearly sign his art. =Golden Age superheroes: 1945‚Äì49= Gifford created at least three of the earliest British Golden Age superheroes, Mr Muscle for Dynamic Comics (1945), Streamline, whose #1 tagline proclaimed him \\"The speediest fighter in the world\\", co-created with Monkhouse for Streamline Comics (1947) and Tiger-Man, debuting in Ray Regan #1 (1949). Gifford himself credits \\"the first British superhero in the American comic book style\\" to Derickson Dene by Nat Brand in British anthology comic The Triumph in 1939, but both Mr Muscle and Streamline were early attempts to introduce British characters in a characteristically American genre, prompted by severely limited imports or reprints of US superhero titles due to wartime paper rationing and import restrictions. Gifford and Monkhouse set up their own publishing company, Streamline, in the early 1950s which published reprints of other Golden Age superheroes such as Captain Might and Masterman. Only Streamline Comics #1 had story and art by Gifford, although he contributed the one-page humour strip Inky the Imp of the Inkpot and the adventure strip Search for the Secret City in #4. Mr Muscle should not to be confused with the later DC character Mister Muscle of Hero Hotline, created by Bob Rozakis, or the Charlton Comics character Mr. Muscles, created by Jerry Siegel. Tiger-Man should not be confused with Tiger Man, the Street & Smith Golden Age hero, Tigerman, the Fiction House Golden Age hero, or Tiger-Man, the Atlas/ Seaboard character. =Gifford projects: Ray Regan, Star Comics, Panto Pranks: 1946‚Äì50s= Gifford created, wrote and edited several comics in the 1940s and 1950s. These included detective title Ray Regan (1949), with art by Ron Embleton, the pantomime-themed Panto Pranks (1949), which Gifford wrote and drew, Fizz Comics (1949) and Star Comics (1954), which he drew and edited with Monkhouse, featuring strips of contemporary entertainers Morecambe and Wise, Bob Monkhouse himself, Jill Day and movie character Tobor The Great. These titles created by Gifford often ran for just a single issue, to take advantage of a loophole in postwar paper rationing, but the succession of short projects suited Gifford's diverse interests as it enabled him to flit from genre to genre. =Western strips: Roy Rogers and others: 1946‚Äì61= Gifford drew and often wrote a number of Western comics strips in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including 'Ace High' Rogers versus Redmask (1946), Bill Elliott in Republic's Old Los Angeles in The Sheriff #3 (1948) and strips for Annie Oakley (1957‚Äì58) and Gunhawks Western (1960‚Äì61). Gifford provided art for movie adaptation strip Roy Rogers in Western comic The Sheriff Comics (no date, 1950s), signing himself 'Gus Denis Gifford' and offering a drawing style [in which] \\"[h]is likenesses could approach very close to the American ones produced by Harry Parks\\", consistent with Gifford's busy, comical style in other genres. =Humour strips: Knockout, Whizzer & Chips and magazine strips: 1946‚Äì71= Gifford and Monkhouse contributed cartoon strips to various magazines in the 1940s and 1950s, including Galaxy magazine (1946) (not to be confused with Galaxy Science Fiction). Gifford drew the cover for Classics Illustrated #146 (British series), Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1962), a more comedic and cartoon-like rendering than was conventional for the title's covers, which tended to be classically heroic and often painted. Gifford went on to produce several strips for the highly popular humour comic Knockout, including Our Ernie (1950), Stoneage Kit the Ancient Brit and his own creation, the gags and puzzles strip Steadfact McStaunch. He later revived Steadfast McStaunch for a run in IPC's new title Whizzer and Chips (1969), which itself merged with Knockout in 1973. =Anglo Studios: Marvelman, Captain Miracle, Super DC, TV Tornado: 1954‚Äì71= After working with Mick Anglo on the ABC science-fiction title Space Comics (1953‚Äì54), Gifford began work for Anglo Studios when it was set up in 1954, including a long stint writing and illustrating early Marvelman, the superhero reinvented in the 1980s with a darker vision by Alan Moore. Gifford worked on a number of strips in several titles in the Marvelman stable, and created the light-hearted backup features Flip and Flop and The Friendly Soul. He also wrote an editorial piece, Founding a Family, on the history of Marvelman Family for a 1988 reprint of the strip in Miracleman Family #2. When Anglo took on US reprint series Annie Oakley, Gifford was one of the staff of British and Spanish artists used to create new strips (1957‚Äì58). Gifford went on to provide Western strips for Anglo Features title Gunhawks Western (1960‚Äì61) and humour strip Our Lad for Anglo's Captain Miracle (1961) contributed several humour strips for Anglo's anthology of Silver Age DC reprints, Super DC (1969‚Äì70), as well as reprints of his humour strip The Friendly Soul from Marvelman in Superman Bumper Book (1970) and Super DC Bumper Book #1 (1971). Later in the 1960s, Gifford also produced the one-off News of the Universe Television Service and regular humour strips Dan Dan the TV Man and the collection of one or two-panel gags, Jester Moment for TV Tornado (1967‚Äì68) where Mick Anglo was editor. =Bibliography: comics art and writing= History and criticism of cinema: 1952‚Äì98 =Reference authorship= Although Gifford did not have an academic background, he was an acknowledged authority on film history who is respected by academics in film studies, media studies and social and cultural history. Much of his reference work is recommended reading in these disciplines. Along with several other pioneering film archivists, Gifford's 'encyclopaedic work' was recognised by the Institute of Historical Research as having \\"provided thoroughgoing maps of British film personnel and production histories\\". Gifford compiled a comprehensive reference work of British-made films, The British Film Catalogue, 1895-1970: A Reference Guide, listing every traceable film made in the UK, including short films generally omitted by film catalogues, with detailed entries including running time, certificate, reissue date, distributor, production company, producer, director, main cast, genre and plot summary. It was a labour of many years, as Gifford tracked down retired industry professionals and researched back issues of trade publications, fanzines and directories. The Catalogue's third (1994) edition revised all entries and was published in two volumes, The Fiction Film, 1895‚Äì1994 and The Non-Fiction Film, 1888‚Äì1994. It became a seminal work for British film historians, acclaimed by The British Film Institute (BFI)'s curator of Moving Image in a Sight & Sound magazine shortlist of the best ever film books: \\"The nearest we have to a British national filmography was created not by any institute or university but by one man.\\" Gifford's popular work A Pictorial History of Horror also made the shortlist. All editions of the Catalogue omitted animated films, but Gifford's British Animated Films, 1895‚Äì1985: A Filmography provided a similarly completist approach. Over 1200 films were detailed, attempting to include every British animated film of the period with a cinema release, whether full-length feature, short, public information film or advertisement. Gifford also provides an historical overview, giving particular attention to the pre-World War II era. As he was to attempt with the history of comics, Gifford sought to correct inaccuracies in cinema history that gave undue credit to the US industry, citing Dudley Buxton \\"who [in 1915] first animated the sinking of the Lusitania in all its terrifying drama, three years before Winsor McCay tackled the same subject in the United States. Yet according to film history, McCay's version was the world's first dramatic cartoon film!\\" Gifford's writing also included biographies of cinematic figures, including Karloff: The Man, The Monster, The Movies and The Movie Makers: Chaplin, with his meticulous research and detailed knowledge well suited to the form. Gifford was a judge at the Sitges 1977 International Festival of Fantasy and Horror. The BFI holds an extensive archive of interviews recorded by Gifford of various figures in the film, television and comics industries. The Denis Gifford Collection is held as part of the BFI National Library. The BFI ran a Denis Gifford Tribute Evening at the National Film Theatre in January 2001 to mark his work on film history. =Popular audience and fan press authorship= As well as vintage comedy, Gifford had a particular interest in genre films, favouring the origins of those genres and the lower-budget B-movie output. He had written for science fiction fanzines since the 1950s, which he regarded as the period in which the genre gained maturity in the cinema: \\"it was the 1950s before sci-fi really got started, first with George Pal's astounding semi-documentary Destination Moon pipped at cinematic post by Robert L. Lipert's B-movie Rocketship X-M. Where the cinema led, comics followed.\\" He had attempted to spur early science fiction 'fandom' with his 1952 Space Patrol Official Handbook, an introduction to science fiction that included an index of 'films of future fantasy' from the 1902 French 'trick' film A Trip to the Moon by Georges M√©li√®s and the 1918 Danish A Trip to Mars up to contemporary films such as the 1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still, screen shots from recent science fiction films The Man from Planet X, Rocketship X-M, The Day the Earth Stood Still and When Worlds Collide. Astronomical facts and diagrams of imagined spacecraft and spacesuit, drawn by Gifford, were also included. Horror held a special fascination for Gifford: he was an active figure in horror fandom of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, including the Gothique Film Society, and in the 1970s he had regular columns in Dez Skinn's House of Hammer magazine, first a serialised Golden History of Horror and later History of Hammer. However, Gifford had been deeply critical of Hammer Studios, especially the productions of its later years, preferring the more understated examples of early British and Hollywood horror. He found Hammer's relatively explicit use of blood-letting and sexuality to be cynically exploitative, noting in his 1973 A Pictorial History of Horror that \\"The new age of horror was geared to a new taste. Where the old films had quickly cut away from the sight of blood, Hammer cut in for a closeup.\\" A Pictorial History of Horror was an influential work for a generation of film and horror enthusiasts, described in The Paris Review by author and journalist Dave Tompkins as \\"the most important book of my childhood\\". Gifford was a lifelong fan of Laurel and Hardy, and founded 'Film Funsters', the first British branch of the Laurel & Hardy Appreciation Society, as well as writing several articles on the duo. He was also a keen Sherlock Holmes enthusiast, and was a member of the Sherlock Holmes Society and wrote various reviews and articles on films featuring the detective. Gifford wrote numerous articles on film and popular entertainment, both professionally and for fanzines. =Bibliography: cinema= Career in cinema: 1962‚Äì67 Although a highly respected film historian, Gifford's professional involvement in cinema was relatively limited. However, in the 1950s and 1960s he directed and photographed a number of short films, most of which were publicity and public information films commissioned by the British Government. He also produced and directed the Pathe newsreel Highlight: The Singing Cinema (1964), a compilation of extracts from British musical films from 1929 to 1964. While at Pathe, Gifford married Angela Kalagias, a fellow Path√© employee. The couple, who later divorced, had one daughter, Pandora Jane, born in 1965. Gifford scripted the Space Race spoof Carry on Spaceman in 1962, but although scheduled the film was not shot. =Filmography= History and criticism of comics: 1970‚Äì95 Gifford was regarded by many as the UK's pre-eminent comics historian, particularly of early British comics. The British Library provides catalogues and reference works written by Gifford as assistance to researchers of its British Comics Collection, and indeed most of the reference works on the subject provided by the British Library were written by Gifford., Comics scholarship, still relatively undeveloped in comparison to other media, was almost non-existent in 1971, when Gifford published his first book on comics history, Discovering Comics. At that time, no comprehensive archive of British comics existed, no fully researched cataloguing had been attempted, the mass pulping of comics in Britain in the 1940s meant that many issues and even titles were lost without effective records, no university courses were dedicated to the study of the medium, and serious research and debate had not taken place into the origin and development of the comic as a form. Gifford was determined that the comic should gain a credibility in mainstream culture and academia which it already possessed in continental Europe, and to a lesser extent the US: \\"Curiously, only Great Britain, where the comic paper was born, takes its comics for what they superficially seem ‚Äì ephemera to be discarded as soon as read.\\"Gifford, Denis, Discovering Comics, 1971, Introduction: The Editor's Chat. Although enthusiastic about comics of every era, Gifford had a particular passion for vintage comics, \\"earlier in the medium's evolution, when it was a chaos of one-offs, irregular schedules, and a comic historian's nightmare of inept publishers operating from the back rooms of run-down bookshops on a shoe string budget.\\" =The origin of the comic and early comics history= Gifford provided the first reliable, detailed account of early comics in works such as Victorian Comics (1976) and The British Comics Catalogue, 1874‚Äì1974 (1974), with a detailed overview in his International Book of Comics (1984). He also advanced debate on the origins of comics, including what the first comic and comic characters were, arguing that \\"there is no point [in the history of comics] where we can pick up a paper and declare it Comic Number One.\\" He identified the first comedic narrative periodical, as an antecedent to the comic as The Comick Magazine (1796) which although all text included a single William Hogarth print per issue, which Gifford suggested when combined formed a \\"narrative sequence ... [so that] they could be described as an early form of comic strip.\\" Gifford identified the significant stage of \\"the first continuing cartoon hero\\" as Rowlandson's Dr Syntax in the serial The Schoolmaster's Tour in The Poetical Magazine (1 May 1809). He argued that \\"in Europe, perhaps the world\\" the first caricature magazine, an important prototypical form of the comic, was Hopkirk's The Glasgow Looking Glass (11 June 1825). Gifford located the origin of the modern graphic narrative in the late nineteenth century, tracing development through various stages that included Judy - The London Serio-Comic Journal (1 May 1867) featuring Ally Sloper, the first recurring character in a text and picture serial. He observed in Victorian Comics that Sloper \\"was the first to appear in comic book format ... a paperback reprint collection ... the first to have his own comic paper ... and was the longest lived [character] in comic history.\\" He suggested a key contender as the first comic as being the paper Funny Folks (12 December 1874), which had an unprecedented half-picture, half-text per page layout. Sloper's debut was certainly a series of panels, but it lacks \\"interdependence as a sequential narrative strategy\\" with images each relaying a single joke without forming a narrative with other panels, and it lacked some key features of the form, such as the speech bubble, while it had accompanying text for each image. Debate continues, but Gifford's research and conclusions into the origins of comics as a medium have gained considerable academic acceptance. =Ally Sloper= Ally Sloper was championed by Gifford as the world's first ever comic character, and became a totemic figure for him, being revived and sometimes drawn by him in a number of comics and other publications that sought to ensure a modern readership had an awareness of early comic history. The Ally Sloper magazine was not a commercial success and lasted only four issues, but the innovation of Gifford's tone in the title was acknowledged by one cultural historian as \\"[w]ith his accurate spoof of the style of traditional British humour comics ... anticipat[ing] Viz by nearly three years.\\" He produced artwork for advertisements for an Ally Sloper T-shirt, which was published in several Alan Class Comics titles in 1976, to promote the Ally Sloper magazine. Gifford also initiated the Ally Sloper Awards in 1976, an annual prize for veteran comic artists. At a summit on comics history convened by the 1989 Lucca Comics Festival in Italy, Gifford was invited to be one of the eleven 'international specialists' to sign a declaration that The Yellow Kid was the first comic character having been first published in 1895. Gifford signed, but pointedly did so in the name of Ally Sloper, first published in 1867. =Historical classification of British comics= Gifford sought to draw a distinct definition for British comics history, as the Golden Age and other historical eras of comics were first defined to describe US comics history. These eras relate to UK comics only as a result of American influence on the UK market and creators, and do not acknowledge key differences in British comics of the period, notably the preponderance in Britain of humorous anthologies rather than the genre titles, most especially superheroes, that predominated in the US. Gifford observed that the \\"Thirties were the Golden Age of British comics\\" due to the profusion of successful, high quality and specifically British humour comics beginning in the 1930s, including D.C. Thomson's The Dandy (4 December 1937), The Beano (30 July 1938) and Magic (22 July 1939) and Amalgamated Press's Jingles (1934), Jolly (1935), Golden (23 October 1937), Radio Fun (15 October 1938), Happy Days (8 October 1938) and Knockout (4 March 1939). The start of the Second World War in 1939, and the resulting paper shortages, marked the end of many of the titles, a definable end to the era and the beginning of what Gifford termed the \\"Dark Age\\". Gifford's Ally Sloper #1, his 1976 attempt to find a modern audience for the character he argued was the world's first in comics =Comics Catalogue and Price Guide= Gifford's The British Comics Catalogue, 1874‚Äì1974 (1974) was the first comprehensive index of British comics, and his later British Comics, Story Papers, Picture Libraries, Girls Papers, American Reprints, Facsmilies, Giveaways Price Guide (1982) the first attempt to offer a price guide for British comics (US comic books had been covered by The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide since 1970). It was the antecedent of works such as the Official Comic Book Price Guide for Great Britain (1989). =Resistance to adult themes in children's comics= Gifford had a particular interest in children's comics. Although his collection included 1960s underground comics, the alternative comics of the 1970s as well as the more experimental mainstream of comics' Modern Age, he was not initially convinced by changing conceptions of comics as a medium suited to addressing adult themes such as sexuality, violence and storytelling techniques influenced by literary fiction, cinema and art. He recognised that the growth in adult readership of comics since the 1970s was due to nostalgia, but did not foresee the potential for a development of the medium. \\"And nostalgia is escape. The comics - the best of them - represent wholesome innocence, a marvelous sense of fun and a pointer to current times perhaps, the triumphant overcoming of all sorts of difficulties.\\" When children's comics began to reflect changes in cinema and mass culture, he was unafraid to speak out, even where this might involve constraints on the comics industry and creators. After media outrage at the 1976 Look Out for Lefty strip about football hooliganism in the IPC comic Action, Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that \\"Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like Action. Action is a new kind of comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce Action are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply.\\" Despite 2000 AD (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed storyelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: \\"Whether children would actually enjoy living in [the future] ... is another matter, for as depicted ... the future is a world of unrelieved violence.\\" Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that \\"I look back to the days of my youth ... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts.\\" However, Gifford's concerns were limited to comics intended for children and adolescents, and he was well aware of a development of the medium for an adult audience. He collected and was able to appreciate the content of underground and Modern Age comics, offering sophisticated and sometimes sympathetic analysis. Gifford's own Ally Sloper comic (1976) offered a combination of vintage and alternative strips for an adult audience, although the nostalgic strips were his primary interest. =The Dandy record challenge= Working for the Guinness Book of Records as a comics expert, Gifford had to qualify his recommendation that The Dandy be regarded as the world's oldest comic (first issue December 1937) after the entry was challenged in 1999. The first issue of Italian comics magazine Il Giornalino was cover dated 1 October 1924, US comic book Detective Comics (March 1937) began nine months earlier, and the Belgian comic magazine Spirou had more issues. Gifford admitted that \\"[i]t may be that we will have to insert the word British into the Guinness Book of Records to clarify the position.\\" =Bibliography: history and criticism of comics= History and criticism of radio, television, music and music hall: 1971‚Äì89 Gifford's work The Golden Age of Radio was the first reference guide to programmes, broadcasters and catchphrases of radio of the 1930s and 1940s, and remains an important source for researchers in radio history. Gifford was working on a filmography and history of 1930s British television, but died before its completion. =Bibliography: radio, television, music and music hall= Career in television and radio: 1953‚Äì99 Gifford wrote extensively for comedy and light entertainment in both television and radio, his work often reflecting his fascinations of radio and film nostalgia and cartoon art. =Television and radio scriptwriting= Gifford wrote the first television series of comedy stars Morecambe and Wise, Running Wild (1954), having been brought in with fellow cartoonist, comic enthusiast and film buff Tony Hawes to save a series which was initially panned by critics. He also provided material for the opening night of ITV (1955) and co-wrote the first comedy show to be screened by BBC2, the TV movie Alberts' Channel Too (1964) for the launch of the channel, although the whole evening's broadcasting was lost due to a power blackout. He wrote for Junior Showtime (1973), devised the nostalgia panel show Looks Familiar (1970‚Äì87) for Thames TV, presented by Denis Norden, its radio counterpart Sounds Familiar and the Thames quiz show Quick on the Draw (1974‚Äì1979) featuring drawings by cartoonists and celebrities, with presenters including Bob Monkhouse, Rolf Harris and Bill Tidy. He also wrote scripts for the ITV children's puppet shows Witches' Brew (1973) and The Laughing Policeman (1974). Gifford also designed stunts for the popular BBC1 game show The Generation Game. The scriptwriting partnership with Hawes began in radio, for weekly BBC concert party The Light Optimists (1953) and continued with stunt devising for the US-bought game show People Are Funny for Radio Luxembourg. =Television and radio broadcasting= A broadcaster in his own right, Gifford featured in numerous television and radio programmes as an expert in the history of film, radio and comics, as well as appearances in a variety of documentary and news magazine programmes over several decades. Appearances included editions of BBC's On The Braden Beat (1964) commenting on comics, Granada's Clapperboard (1974) and a review of forthcoming horror films for BBC1's Film 1973 (1973), Goon but not Forgotten, a radio history of the Goon Show as part of the Laughter in the Air: The Story of Radio Comedy (1979) and twice as guest panellist for Radio 4 panel show Quote... Unquote (1985). Gifford and Monkhouse reprised their partnership with BBC radio programmes on the history of the comics, Sixpence for a Superman (1999) on British comics and the two-part A Hundred Laughs for a Ha'penny (1999), a history of comic papers. =Television and radio credits= Obituaries: 1992‚Äì2000 Gifford also regularly wrote obituaries of notable figures in comics, film and entertainment history for British national newspapers The Independent and The Guardian and posthumously for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, drawing on his specialist knowledge and often personal familiarity with the subject. His output was prolific and constant, with his own obituary in The Guardian noting that \\"[h]is last commission was phoned in from his home in Sydenham, south London, to his editor on Thursday, May 18; it is thought he died the same day.\\" Collection of comics and other popular media Gifford's most valuable research resource was his own collection, as in over sixty years he had accumulated what is generally recognised as the largest comic collection in the UK and the largest collection of British comics in the world, including the only known complete runs of all comics published in the UK in the 1940s. He collected the first and last issues of all comics published in the UK, as well as Christmas issues and other special editions, and also collected first issues of US comics. To a lesser extent, first issues of comics from other countries were also collected. Gifford was also a collector of other ephemera, including pulp books, popular magazines, theatrical programmes, film and comic fanzines, original film scripts and sheet music, as well as pop culture memorabilia, describing himself as \\"the keeper of the nation's nostalgia\\". and with a collection that included periodicals not to be found in the British Library. It was an obsession which dominated both his life and his South London home, once described in a colour supplement interview as the den of \\"a boy who had run away from home\\" and never returned. A reliable figure was never established for the size of his collection, but its scale constrained movement throughout the house and extended into every room, even the kitchen: \\"There are comics on the stove, on the fridge, on the floor. Denis Gifford can still use his grill, but roasts are a memory for he can no longer open his oven. The fridge filled up years ago, for Denis is fascinated by the free gifts that come with some comics ... There are lollipops in the fridge now, and Desperate Dan nougat.\\" Unusually for a collector, Gifford's interests were defined by their eclecticism, including comics, radio recordings and film from throughout the world and spanning from the origins of the media up to new releases. His own 'biog' for a 1975 book calculates his collection \\"extends to some 20,000 issues\\" but is careful to limit the estimate to the particularly British form of 'comic papers' which excluded his vast collection of American comic books, and in any case accumulated many more in the next 25 years of his life. He had certain specific interests, notably British horror films of the 1930s to the 1960s, early cinema and radio, Laurel and Hardy movies and memorabilia, British comic papers of the late nineteenth century and British and US comics of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, especially those which featured personalities from contemporary radio. However, the parameters of his interests and collection broadened substantially throughout his life. Gifford's collection had suffered an early setback, an anecdote related by Bob Monkhouse: \\"You cannot begin to imagine his grief when he completed his National Service to return home to find that his mother had thrown away his huge collection of Film Fun, The Joker, Merry and Bright and a dozen other titles ... Denis was to spend the rest of his life trying to replace those lost copies.\\" Gifford's mother was later to express deep regret at their destruction. Despite his hopes that his vast collection might form the basis of a national museum of comics, through an archive such as the Victoria and Albert Museum National Art Library Comics and Comic Art Collection, it was broken up and auctioned off after his death, \\"leaving 12 tons of paper at his home to be cleared and sorted.\\" Monkhouse reflected in the foreword to auction catalogue of The Denis Gifford Collection on how one \\"whose researches were so meticulous have allowed this vast gathering of treasures to have swollen into such unruly and uncatalogued confusion\\". The sale was described in the auction pamphlet as \\"surely the largest private collection of annuals, books, cartoons, cinema history, comics, ephemera & original artwork ever to come on the market. The collection, housed in some 600 boxes and weighing ten tons, arrived on a groaning lorry and took five men nearly three hours to unload. We expect sales to run to some 4000 lots.\\" Gifford's collection was the product of his lifelong passion for comics and popular culture, and his highly prolific research work was an attempt to provide a comprehensive history of the ephemeral. Particularly in the early decades of his writing on the subject, pop culture drew little attention from academic research and Gifford was particularly passionate about the most obscure examples of vintage comics, film, television and radio, and determined that they should be recognised, chronicled and remembered before extant copies were lost. Comic fandom: fanzines and conventions Gifford was a pivotal figure in the development of comics \\"fandom\\" in the UK, first through his writing and publishing of early fanzines in the 1950s. In the 1970s he helped introduce comics conventions to the UK, events where creators and industry figures could meet and respond to comics fans. It was a significant progression of the already established comics marts where comics were simply sold, and in which Gifford was a key figure, providing the introductory presentation at the Comic Mart Summer Special 1974 and other UK events. In 1974 he was the only comics industry guest at an early meeting of Britain's major comics convention, Comicon 74. Gifford organised Comics 101 in 1976, the first convention dedicated to British comic creators, with guests including celebrated figures in British comics including Frank Hampson, Leo Baxendale, Frank Bellamy and Ron Embleton, Marvelman creator Mick Anglo and Garth creator Steve Dowling, Gifford conducting an on-stage interview with Dowling. The name of the convention was a reference to the 101 years since the first issue of Funny Folks (1874) which Gifford regarded as the first comic. In 1977 Gifford co-founded the Society of Strip Illustration, a network for all those involved in any stage of the creative process of comics production which later became the Comic Creators Guild. In 1978 he established the Association of Comics Enthusiasts, whose newsletter Comic Cuts ran for 14 years proper and, as a section of UK comics fanzine The Illustrated Comics Journal, until his death. Gifford also wrote extensively for comics magazines and fanzines, particularly Comic Cuts, and it was here that he wrote some of his most specialist work on comics history and criticism. Prizegiving of the first Ally Sloper Awards for comic creators also took place at Comics 101, with Bob Monkhouse presenting. Gifford continued to organise, guest and attend comics conventions throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s in the UK, USA and throughout Europe, including regular guest appearances the Lucca International Comics Festival, was an official guest at the first UK Comic Art Convention (UKCAC) in 1985 and was a guest speaker at the 1st UK Paperback and Pulp Bookfair in 1991. Ally Sloper Awards Gifford created the Ally Sloper Awards, a series of awards to recognise veteran British comics artists. The award was first presented in 1976, but no longer runs.

Twenty five barrack blocks were built by 1906;The Geographical Information System on Hong Kong Heritage: Former Whitfield Barracks, Block S61 the Barracks were developed in subsequent years. By 1910, there had been 85 barrack buildings constructed. A mosque was also built at the southeastern corner of the site for worship by the garrison. It belonged to the British Military Force when Hong Kong was under British rule. The premises was later returned to the Government of Hong Kong in 1967. In 1970, the Urban Council redeveloped the site into the Kowloon Park. The Government was criticised when the Executive Council approved plans in 1982 for a strip of retail premises fronting Nathan Road to be carved into the hill of Kowloon Park. The move was first proposed when the Barracks were converted into public open space in 1970, and ignited some controversy. It was opposed by the Urban Council, as well as the Muslim community, whose mosque was close by.Michael Chugani, Kowloon Park land sale plan tipped to spark row, South China Morning Post, 10 January 1982 The rights for the development of the 5,410 sq metre strip were sold in February 1983 to a subsidiary of New World Development for $218 million.Jim Gilchrist, \\"'Bargain' $218m for park site\\", South China Morning Post, 6 February 1983.

They are a pair of identical two storied colonial military barrack blocks, and were originally part of six barrack blocks built parallel to one another. The roofs are pitched with Chinese tiles with tar finish. They housed the former Hong Kong Museum of History from 1983 to 1998 before the completion of the present Museum at Chatham Road South. An extension block linking the two historical barracks was constructed in the 1980s to provide more space for the museum facilities.

It was published in 1994 in the United States and in 1995 in Great Britain. Like its successors, Two for the Dough and Three to Get Deadly, One for the Money is a long-time best-seller, appearing for 75 consecutive weeks on the USA Today list of 150 best-selling novels, peaking at number 13. Before this novel, Evanovich wrote 11 category romance novels. She then \\"ran out of sexual positions and decided to move into the mystery genre.\\" Before writing One for the Money, her first mystery novel, Evanovich spent two years investigating the world of law enforcement, shadowing both bail enforcement agents and the Trenton police, observing their actions and the equipment they carried. She also learned how to shoot a gun. One for the Money was named a New York Times Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly \\"Best Book of 1994,\\" and a USA Today \\"Best Bet.\\" For this book, Evanovich also won the 1995 Dilys Award, one of only three authors to do so for their first mystery (the others being Julia Spencer-Fleming and Louise Penney). This novel introduced characters that would frequent the subsequent novels. As of December 2016, there have been twenty-four published novels, three novellas, and one short story in the Stephanie Plum series. Plot summary Stephanie Plum, laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer for a Newark department store, applies for a filing job with her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman. Vinnie's assistant, Connie, tells her the job is taken, but suggests she works as a bounty hunter, apprehending clients who have failed to appear for their court dates. Stephanie is excited to learn that Joe Morelli, a Trenton vice cop and onetime sexual acquaintance of hers, is FTA and facing charges for murder one. Vinnie initially refuses to give her a job, but Morelli's bounty is $10,000, which Stephanie desperately needs, so she blackmails Vinnie into employing her, by threatening to expose his \\"addiction to kinky sex\\" to his unsuspecting wife. Staking out Morelli's apartment, Stephanie follows his cousin, Mooch, to Morelli's hideout and finds him quickly, but is humiliated when he laughs off her demand that she come with him, pointing out (correctly) that she has neither the equipment nor the training to apprehend an unwilling fugitive. Connie puts her in touch with Vinnie's \\"star\\" bounty hunter, Ricardo Manoso, a.k.a. \\"Ranger\\", who gives her a crash-course in bounty hunting. He also buys Stephanie her first gun, a compact Smith & Wesson revolver, and fills her in on Morelli's alleged crime: shooting an unarmed man, Ziggy Kuleska, at the apartment of a prostitute, Carmen Sanchez. Morelli claims that Ziggy was armed and Morelli shot him in self-defense, but no gun was recovered at the crime scene. Stephanie's friend, police officer Eddie Gazarra, advises her that Morelli is likely going around Trenton, trying to find witnesses who will clear his name, so her best bet at finding him is to follow the same trail. Stephanie's first stop is a boxing gym on Stark Street (Trenton's roughest neighborhood) to interview champion boxer Benito Ramirez and his manager Jimmy Alpha, both known associates of Ziggy Kuleska. Her interview with Ramirez quickly turns ugly when he assaults her, but she is rescued by Morelli, who disappears almost as quickly as he appeared. Exploring Morelli's apartment with Ranger, Stephanie decides to \\"commandeer\\" Morelli's Jeep Grand Cherokee, counting on trapping him when he tries to steal it back. Instead, he catches her unaware in the shower and leaves her handcuffed, naked, to the curtain rod, forcing her to call Ranger for help. She continues to follow the trail of possible witnesses to Morelli's crime, but is shaken when two of the witnesses are later found dead, and Lula, a prostitute working on Stark Street that she spoke with, is hung outside her apartment window, raped and beaten nearly to death. When Stephanie returns home from the hospital, Morelli is there, and offers her a deal: his movements have become too restricted, so if she helps him investigate and clear his name, he will let her bring him into custody and collect the bounty. While he is hiding in her apartment, Vinnie's regular bounty hunter, Morty Beyers, comes by and requests his case files back, since he's recovered from his appendicitis. He also steals the keys to Morelli's SUV from Stephanie's purse, thinking to lure Morelli to him in the same way. Instead, Morty is killed when a car bomb destroys the SUV, proving that whatever Stephanie is investigating is making someone angry or nervous. At a butcher shop that Ziggy Kuleska was known to frequent, Stephanie is shocked to recognize the \\"flat-nose\\" guy behind the counter as the witness Morelli described at the scene of Ziggy's death. They follow him to a moored boat, and Morelli finds traces of heroin that link the boat to the illegal drug traffic run by a local Jamaican gang. They then follow the trail to a freezer truck, where they find oil drums containing the bodies of Carmen and the witness. Morelli despairs, knowing that this has practically eliminated the chances of him clearing his name. Stephanie advocates calling the police, but Morelli refuses, tossing in a remark about her ineptitude as a bounty hunter that stings her into locking him in the freezer truck and driving it to the police station to hand him over. Returning home, Stephanie is held at gunpoint by Jimmy Alpha, who she had taken to be a helpless bystander. Ruefully, he tells her that managing a champion boxer like Ramirez is every promoter's dream, but Ramirez has become a sadistic psychopath, and Alpha can't control him any longer. Alpha has tried to \\"diversify\\" by using his earnings from Ramirez to buy other businesses, such as the butcher shop, but was lured into using his boat and his businesses to assist in the Jamaicans' drug trade. Carmen was on the verge of telling the truth to Morelli, which is why Ziggy killed her before Morelli arrived, and the now-dead witness took Ziggy's gun after Morelli shot him. Now Stephanie is too close to the truth, which is why Alpha will have to have Ramirez rape and torture her to death, before Alpha shoots him and retires peacefully. Stephanie shoves Alpha to the ground, taking a bullet in her rear end from Alpha's gun, before grabbing her purse and emptying her revolver into Alpha's heart. Thanks to a microphone hidden on her by Morelli, Alpha's confession was recorded and clears Morelli's name, though Stephanie still receives the capture fee from Vinnie. Morelli visits her apartment with a conciliatory pizza, adding that Ramirez has been arrested and indicted. He also asks if she will continue working for Vinnie, and she says she probably will. The experience has rekindled their attraction for each other, and he tries to make amends by apologizing for writing a lewd poem about her on the stadium wall. Stephanie, who only knew about the poem on the wall of the local delicatessen, gets furious all over again. = Car death(s) = *Stephanie's Mazda Miata: repossessed; *Morelli's Jeep Grand Cherokee: destroyed by a car bomb. = Failure-to-Appear (FTA) assignments = *Joe Morelli: First degree murder *Clarence Sampson: DUI *Lonnie Dodd: auto theft *William Earling: indecent exposure Film adaptation A film adaptation was produced by Tom Rosenberg for Lakeshore Entertainment, with Katherine Heigl playing the role of Stephanie Plum. Additional cast members included Jason O'Mara as Morelli, Sherri Shepherd as Lula, Daniel Sunjata as Ranger, Patrick Fischler as Vinnie Plum, John Leguizamo as Jimmy Alpha, and Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur. Describing the fit of her books to film, Janet explained, 'I'm an entertainer.. When I write, it's a movie to me. I even started doing dialogue by going on stage and doing improv.' The film was released on January 27, 2012 to universally negative reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment. Development Janet Evanovich started the Stephanie Plum series after writing a series of romance novels. She wrote Stephanie as 'sassy and smart-mouthed', the 'Indiana Jones of Trenton'. The mystery genre appealed to her as a way to include humor, romance and adventure in her work. Critical reception Publishers Weekly's positive review noted One for the Money for its humor, as well as its dialogue: 'astute and raunchy,' Awards and nominations One for the Money won the 1995 Dilys Award presented by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.

Like others in the Stephanie Plum series, Two for the Dough was a best-seller, spending 36 weeks on the Top 150 list. Plot introduction Stephanie Plum is still an inexperienced bounty hunter, so her boss and cousin Vinnie gives her an easy case: apprehend local boy Kenny Mancuso, accused of shooting his best friend in the knee and then jumping bail. Because Kenny is the black sheep cousin of vice cop Joe Morelli, Morelli is on Kenny's trail as well. There's also a case of 24 missing caskets competing for Stephanie's time. Plot summary While Stephanie is looking for Kenny around their Trenton neighborhood, the friend he shot - Moogey Bues - is shot again. This second attack is fatal, which complicates the case against Kenny. At the same time, Stephanie is approached by Spiro Stiva, the stepson of the owner of the local funeral home, who wants to hire her as a private investigator. Spiro purchased twenty-four bargain basement coffins, but they have mysteriously gone missing. Spiro has not reported the loss to the police, out of fear that his stepfather, who is convalescing in the hospital, will find out. Morelli, who is also looking for Kenny, warns her that something is suspicious about Spiro's offer; any legitimate person would have filed a police report, plus the fact that Spiro, Kenny, and Moogey were best friends in high school. As the book continues, Stephanie begins receiving embalmed body parts in her apartment along with threatening notes. When she refuses to stop investigating, Kenny attacks her Grandma Mazur on the street, stabbing her through the hand with an icepick, though without doing permanent damage. Morelli confides to Stephanie that a large shipment of military-grade weapons - armor-piercing bullets, LAWs, and brand-new assault rifles and pistols - went missing from Fort Braddock, and several reappeared on the streets in Philadelphia and around New Jersey. Kenny, who was discharged from the U.S. Army two months ago, had access to the weapons depot, and the gun he used to shoot Moogey also belonged to the missing inventory. Morelli believes that Kenny, Spiro and Moogey stole the guns and were selling them, though he doesn't know who killed Moogey or why. Eventually, Stephanie and Grandma Mazur find themselves locked in the basement of Stiva's Funeral Home when Spiro and Kenny confront each other. It turns out that an associate of Kenny's, an auto mechanic named Sandeman, overheard enough to figure out what Kenny and Spiro were up to. He killed Moogey and stole the guns, which were hidden in Spiro's caskets. Kenny, believing that Spiro had double-crossed him, went on a rampage, sending body parts and threats to Spiro as well as Stephanie, before tracking down Sandeman and the guns, now hidden in the basement of the Funeral Home. They just have to kill Stephanie and Grandma Mazur to cover their tracks. However, Spiro and Kenny both underestimated Grandma Mazur. When they open the locked room, Grandma pulls a pistol from her handbag and opens fire, inadvertently hitting one of the caskets and causing an explosion that burns down the funeral home. Stephanie and Grandma Mazur both manage to escape, and Kenny staggers out a moment later, though there is no sign of Spiro. In a rage, Stephanie subdues Kenny - with some help from Morelli - and takes him to jail. Lula, the prostitute introduced in the previous book, One For the Money, gets a job as a file clerk at Vinnie's Bail Bonds company. She often joins Stephanie as her sidekick in addition to her filing duties. =Car Death= Stephanie's Jeep Wrangler, Sahara model, stolen outside of the Eternal Slumber funeral home on Stark Street, and most likely wound up in a chop shop. = Failure-to-Appear (FTA) assignments = *Kenny Mancuso: Shooting his best friend in the knee *Eugene Petras: Domestic Violence Trivia *This book marks the introduction of \\"Big Blue\\", the \\"indestructible\\" powder-blue 1953 Buick Roadmaster belonging to Stephanie's Great Uncle Sandor.

Development Janet Evanovich started the Stephanie Plum series after writing a series of romance novels, having 'run out of positions'. She based the character of Stephanie on her daughter, Alex - and also on herself to a degree.

It won the 1998 Dilys Award. Plot introduction Stephanie Plum is a streetwise Jersey Girl who ended up as a bounty hunter by chance (and family connections). When a kind, old candy store owner (Uncle Mo) goes FTA (failure to appear) after being arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, Stephanie reluctantly agrees to go after him. Explanation of the novel's title The title comes from the saying \\"One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four to GO!\\" Plot summary Stephanie is on the trail of beloved Moses Bedemier, a mild-mannered man who runs an ice-cream parlor/candy store in the Burg. Mo is an upstanding citizen with ties to almost every family in Trenton. He gets ticketed by an overly-excited, fresh-out-of-the-academy cop for carrying a concealed weapon, and then fails to appear for his court date. No one wants to help Stephanie haul \\"Uncle Mo\\" (as he is widely known) to jail, so her apprehension work is frustratingly slow. \\"Mo would never do anything wrong,\\" is the standard refrain from all the Burg's residents when Stephanie questions them. Since her neighbors and family refuse to help her, she calls on her mentor Ranger, her sidekick (and aspiring bounty hunter) Lula, and Joe Morelli, vice cop and former lover. As she investigates, Stephanie confides to Morelli that something feels wrong about Mo - everyone loves him for his profession, but no one seems to know anything about his private life, and a concealed weapons charge is not serious enough for him to go on the run. Lula's friend Jackie, still working as a prostitute on Stark Street, asks Stephanie to help her find her worthless boyfriend, who disappeared with Jackie's almost-new car. A short while later, they find the man's body under the car, shot dead. Even more strange, while snooping through the basement of Mo's ice cream shop, Stephanie finds four dead bodies buried in the dirt, all drug dealers. Stephanie suspects that mild-mannered Mo has become a vigilante. This suspicion soon circulates around the Burg, and, far from being upset, most of the residents decide Mo is a hero and still refuse to help Stephanie find him. Worse, men in masks are following her around, threatening to kill her if she keeps looking for Mo. It is Stephanie's slimy cousin Vinnie who provides the final clue. Vinnie had already told her that Mo was secretly homosexual, but she has a theory about his connection with the drug dealers, and Vinnie's investigation confirms it: Mo, under an alias, is actually a renowned director and producer of underground BDSM films. He owns a small rural house outside Trenton under that alias, where he shoots most of his movies. Stephanie, Lula, and Ranger confront Mo at the house, where he is hiding out. He confesses that one of the drug dealers \\"procured\\" young men and women (i.e., drug addicts desperate for money) to perform in Mo's movies, but crossed the line when he asked permission to sell drugs outside Mo's store. Mo pretended to agree, but suggested a \\"sting operation\\" to a local church reverend, who embraced the idea. However, Mo did not plan on the scheme \\"snowballing\\", and now the reverend and several members of his congregation have become a death squad, privately \\"cleaning up the streets\\" of Trenton. Mo was prepared to testify to the authorities, but the vigilantes are now hunting him along with the drug dealers. Just then, the death squad pulls up outside the house and attacks with heavy weapons, including a rocket launcher that blows up Stephanie's pickup truck. Ranger hunkers down in the house, while telling Stephanie and Lula to take Mo to safety. Stephanie tells Lula to drive away with Mo, then draws her gun to help Ranger, but Morelli and the police arrive with reinforcements before anyone is killed or seriously wounded. The vigilantes are apprehended, and Stephanie returns Mo to court. As Stephanie attempts to resume her relationship with Morelli, they are constantly interrupted - first by criminals, then by Stephanie's accidental dye job that makes her look like Ronald McDonald. =Car Death= *Stephanie's Baby Nissan Pickup, shot by a rocket launcher = Failure-to-Appear (FTA) assignments = *Moses \\"Uncle Mo\\" Bedemier: Carrying Concealed *Stuart Baggett: Shooting up 14 unoccupied cars (including two police cars)  Trivia  *Jackie, Lula's friend, first appeared in One for the Money.

Belarusian Guiding started in 1922 in the then Polish parts of present Belarus. In 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the restart of Guiding was supported by WAGGGS; leader training was undertaken by the Girl Guides Association of Cyprus. The association became a member of WAGGGS in 1996. History The initial development of Scouting in Belarus took place within the Russian Scout movement, as part of the Russian empire. A Scout organization was founded in Kletsk, and Scouts appeared in Nyasvizh and other nearby villages. In 1929, American Methodists helped found a Girl Scout organization in Vilna. It lasted until 1929, but by the end of the 1920s, Scouting had been banned by the Soviet Union, and Scout activities ended, with many leaders and members arrested and imprisoned. Emergence of democratic principles in the mid-1980s made possible the creation of alternatives to the communist pioneer organizations. Close connections were formed with Guide and Scout organizations of many European countries, when children from areas affected by the Chernobyl accident were invited to summer camps abroad during the Chernobyl Children's Project in 1990. Especially close links were developed with Cyprus, and between Minsk and the Guides of Lincolnshire. In 1992, Cyprus was officially appointed Link country to support the development of Guiding in Belarus, and in June 1993 the first conference of the Association of Belarusian Guides was held in Minsk. There is also a close link to Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen √ñsterreichs in Austria. In 2000 a delegation of Association of Belarusian Guides took part in the Viennese International Regional Camp \\"Vienna 2000\\", in 2003 a delegation took part in the Freelife Jamboree in Upper Austria, in 2008 Guides from Belarus took part in AQUA!-The Water Jamboree also in Upper Austria and in spring 2009 a Guider from the Association of Belarusian Guides took part in the Wood Badge training course of Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen √ñsterreichs. In 2003/04 the Austrian Boy Scouts and Girl Guides supported \\"Mediaboom\\", a project on media and journalism of the Belarusian Girl Guides. Since the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, neighboring Belarus received some of the highest levels of radiation; the results of which can still be seen in the environment and in the health of the population. Svetlana Korotkevich, International Commissioner of the Association of Belarusian Girl Guides, is working on its Chernobyl project to raise awareness of the ongoing problems resulting from the disaster and to encourage associations in other countries to welcome groups of Belarusian children in order to give them a healthy break in a \\"clean\\" environment.

The Mount Washington Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 with a boundary increase in 2001, with five contributing buildings and four contributing structures. Description Historically, Mount Washington was a small area. However, residents and businesses of many other nearby neighborhoods in the 21209 ZIP code and a small portion of the 21215 ZIP code (west of Pimlico Road) around the neighborhood refer to their location as Mount Washington. Though mostly within the Baltimore city limits, but mixed with some of these areas within Baltimore County as Pikesville. The Mount Washington neighborhood is served by the Mount Washington Improvement Association,\\"About\\". Mount Washington Improvement Association. Retrieved March 5, 2018. which, though not speaking on behalf of all the neighborhood's residents, wields significant political clout in Baltimore. Mount Washington is mostly residential, though it has two small commercial areas: *Mount Washington Village, off the west side of the Jones Falls Expressway near the beautiful Kelly Avenue bridge, containing several restaurants and stores, as well as the Baltimore Light Rail's Mount Washington Station. *Mount Washington Mill, a refurbished textile mill now housing a Whole Foods, Starbucks, and other stores and offices, off the east side of the Jones Falls Expressway near the Kelly Avenue bridge, commonly referred to as Historic Mount Washington. These two areas were at one time viewed as a single area, but since the construction of Interstate 83 these areas have been separated, and travel over a longer distance is required between them. History In 1854, George Gelbach and Elias Heiner purchased 314 acres near Washingtonville, a mill village. Though the original homes were designed as summer houses, Gelbach envisioned that Mount Washington would become eventually become a suburb of Baltimore. Building picked up after the Civil War, with developers, such as John Graham (a resident of Mount Washington) developing small groups of houses around the South Road section. The northern section of the area, what became Dixon's Hill, was the result of Thomas Dixon purchasing 20 acres from Gelbach in 1855 and developed in the 1860s. Mount Washington is considered by some to be Baltimore's first suburb. It was part of Baltimore County until it was annexed in 1914.https://chap.baltimorecity.gov/mount-washington Major roads in Mount Washington Some of the main roads that run through the Mount Washington area are: Immediate: *Interstate 83, also known as the Jones Falls Expressway (JFX) *Falls Road *Kelly Avenue *Greely Road *Smith Avenue Extended: *Greenspring Avenue *Cross Country Boulevard *Pimlico Road *Northern Parkway *Lake Avenue Other communities near Mount Washington include: *Village of Cross Keys (south) *Cheswolde (west) *Pimlico (west) *Rodgers Forge (east) *Ruxton (north) Public transportation Mount Washington is well known for its public transportation operated by the Maryland Transit Administration. This, most notably, includes the Central Light Rail line. It has a stop in historic Mount Washington Village. Light Rail service operates to downtown Baltimore, Hunt Valley, and BWI Airport every 10‚Äì15 minutes at most times.

It is also classified as a type of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It can be difficult to distinguish unstable angina from non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They differ primarily in whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient damage to the heart's muscular cells to release detectable quantities of a marker of injury (typically troponin T or troponin I). Unstable angina is considered to be present in patients with ischemic symptoms suggestive of an ACS and no elevation in troponin, with or without ECG changes indicative of ischemia (e.g., ST segment depression or transient elevation or new T wave inversion). Since an elevation in troponin may not be detectable for up to 12 hours after presentation, UA and NSTEMI are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of unstable angina is controversial. Until recently, unstable angina was assumed to be angina pectoris caused by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with partial thrombosis and possibly embolization or vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia. However, sensitive troponin assays reveal rise of cardiac troponin in the bloodstream with episodes of even mild myocardial ischemia. Since unstable angina is assumed to occur in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia without troponin release, the concept of unstable angina is being questioned with some calling for retiring the term altogether. Diagnosis Unstable angina is characterized by at least one of the following: # Occurs at rest or minimal exertion and usually lasts more than 20 minutes (if nitroglycerin is not administered) # Being severe (at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification 3) and of new onset (i.e. within 1 month) # Occurs with a crescendo pattern (brought on by less activity, more severe, more prolonged or increased frequency than previously).Libby: Braunwald's Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine Fifty percent of people with unstable angina will have evidence of necrosis of the heart's muscular cells based on elevated cardiac serum markers such as creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK)-MB and troponin T or I, and thus have a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Management Nitroglycerin can be used immediately to dilate the venous system and reduce the circulating blood volume, therefore reducing the work and oxygen demand of the heart. In addition, nitroglycerin causes peripheral venous and artery dilation reducing cardiac preload and afterload. These reductions allow for decreased stress on the heart and therefore lower the oxygen demand of the heart's muscle cells. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel can help reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation, as well as combining these with an anticoagulant such as a low molecular weight heparin.

The project was conducted from 1999 to 2003 by the Early Childhood Research Unit of the University of Oregon College of Education. The principal investigators were Dr. Ruth Kaminski, one of the co-authors of the DIBELS early literacy assessment, and Beth Stormshak. The goal of the program was to increase literacy skills of at-risk children by improving their learning environments by increasing the number of planned and focused activities. The curriculum had two components: a classroom ecology component and family-focused intervention activities. The intervention was focused on strengthening children's skills in social ability. In order to help children they increased parenting and family participation in school by working directly with the parents of the students. Classroom ecology The classroom ecology component is designed to help teachers develop the classroom environment in ways that promote the development of important literacy skills in children. The teachers were trained to focus on the overall environment in the classroom focusing on the physical environment (e.g., space and materials), the planning and scheduling of teacher activities and the structuring of a daily schedule, and improving the social environment by teaching social roles and expectations, monitoring students social interactions, and interacting with students regularly. One of the most important parts of the classroom ecology component were the Circle Time Activities which were instructional periods led by the teacher that focused on either sharing or vocabulary that lasted about 10 minutes each. Teachers were instructed to review skills learned previously, integrate new and old knowledge, and practice specific skills. Another important component of classroom ecology was the Activity-Based Intervention (ABI) that provided an opportunity for children to learn critical skills through play and routine activities that are developmentally-appropriate and interesting to preschoolers. ABI's used here were related to skills learned during Circle Time Activities. Family-focused intervention The family-focused intervention encouraged parents to instigate non-directive play with their preschoolers and responsive communication. They were also encouraged to attend to their child's emotions and actively discipline their children. Children were provided with the skills used in the classroom component each week and instructed to give their children opportunities at home to practice skills learned in the classroom. The intervention also included a STAR Home Visiting curriculum where the initial focus was on parent-child joint storybook reading and the development of language skills. As the child progressed through preschool the focus shifted to phonological awareness skills and knowledge of the alphabet. References * Kaminski, R., Stormshak, E. A., Good, R., & Goodman, M. R.

The neighborhood is on steep sloping heights, about four city blocks wide (west to east) and fifteen blocks long (north to south) and above and surrounded on three sides (northeast - east - southeast) in a highly industrialized waterfront area in the southern part of the city, and receives its name from the body (cove) of water to the east in which it sits. The cove of \\"Curtis Bay\\" with two small branches - Stone House Cove and Cabin Branch is fed from the southwest by Curtis Creek which in turn is formed further south by Marley Creek and Furnace Branch/Creek in Anne Arundel County. Adjoining nearby to the east is Thoms Cove near Hawkins Point at the north end of the Marley Neck peninsula. Curtis Bay cove itself also has a dredged deep water channel with considerable port facilities and waterfront industries and is a branch of the main stem of the Patapsco River, which forms the extensive frontage of Baltimore Harbor and Port, northwest off of the Chesapeake Bay. The residential community of Curtis Bay is along three major north-south thoroughfares of Curtis Avenue, Pennington Avenue (Maryland Route 173 on which most commercial businesses are located) and residential Fairhaven Avenue and a partial street of Prudence Street. Running west to east are fifteen smaller residential streets named alphabetically for various types of trees. \\"The Bay\\", as it is often called colloquially, also offers a variety of housing, townhouses, rowhouses, individual homes, (both constructed of wood-frame, brick, stone and concrete block/stuccoed) and corner stores, taverns/bars. Curtis Bay is also home since 1897 to the United States Coast Guard Yard (formerly the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service until 1915) on Hawkins Point Road / extending south from Pennington Avenue (Maryland Route 173) on Arundel Cove off Curtis Creek on the border line with neighboring suburban Anne Arundel County to the south. During the middle and late 19th and early 20th centuries, a Quarantine Station and lazaretto run by the United States Government agency (future U.S. Public Health Service) along Thoms Cove between Sledds Point and Hawkins Point. There is a large Polish American community in Curtis Bay. The former town hall, real estate office, volunteer fire station, and meeting/assembly hall on the second floor for Curtis Bay was constructed on the heights overlooking the new town and rapidly developing industrial waterfront along Fairview Avenue (now Fairhaven Avenue) facing Filbert Street by a successor developing firm, the South Baltimore Harbor and Improvement Company in 1905. In 1925, the United Polish Societies purchased the building and named it Polish Home Hall and it became central to the Polish ethnic experience in Curtis Bay, functioning as a social, educational, and political center for Curtis Bay's Polish community into the 1970s.

Origins Walter Mentzer felt that the drag racers needed an organization that spoke for them as opposed to one that spoke for the drag strips. Mentzer went to the Pennsylvania county office that handled such things and incorporated the name of the American Hot Rod Association with himself at the helm. At the end of 1955, Hot Rod magazine did a story on the fledgling Pennsylvania non-profit organization and it attracted a lot of attention. Mentzer wanted the racers to actually have a voice in how this organization was run. Every member registered with the home office in Pittsburgh and after a year, they had a vote in how it was run. Mentzer was drafted in 1957, which took him out of the racing picture. Don Garlits had been elected president of the organization in 1958 with Kansas City racer and insurance salesman, Jim Tice, being installed as vice-president. By late 1959, Garlits had gone on with his racing career and Tice became president of the organization and changed the AHRA into a profit-making organization. Tice moved the AHRA to Kansas City, took over the books, and incorporated the name there, creating a profit-making organization. On the weekend prior to the Nationals event, the group re-convened and had grown to where 18 states were represented at the second meeting. It was announced that AHRA would hold its National Championship drags at the 8,000-foot long Great Bend site through 1959. AHRA was responsible for much significant drag racing history. It was AHRA that first provided a home for Top Fuel, ignoring the fuel ban of 1957 through 1963, and also giving the Funny Cars their first hot rod association abode. In fact, while it was not called such, AHRA also had the first Pro Stock class, a heads-up, ultimate-statement Super Stock eliminator in 1968. ‚ÄúAHRA, and in the middle 1950s, the ATAA (Automobile Timing Association of America), ran nitro,\\" said former AHRA president and 10-time AHRA Top Fuel champ ‚ÄúBig Daddy‚Äù Don Garlits. ‚ÄúI had run the ATAA (World Series of Drag Racing) event on nitro race. In fact, the ATAA World Series, which they first held in Lawrenceville, Ill., and later Cordova, really was the first of the big races for fuel cars and that was the way I wanted to race ‚Äî on nitro.\\" In 1960, AHRA had undergone some more significant changes and these involved a lot more than what fuel was run. Garlits had been elected president of the organization in 1958 with Kansas City racer and insurance salesman, Jim Tice, being installed as vice-president. Garlits, as could be expected, would have a difficult schedule to wrestle with. On the one hand, he was voted to handle a growing hot rod association, and on the other, he had a full-on, year-long racing schedule. He couldn't do both. ‚ÄúAHRA was originally set up as a non- profit organization and realistically, I suppose I could‚Äôve been seen as a figurehead president,‚Äù Garlits recalled. ‚ÄúJim Tice used to be involved in insurance and he took the company books with him to Kansas City, while I was racing in Florida. I didn't think there was anything crooked going on, he was a businessman, but over the years, AHRA changed subtly into a profit-making organization.‚Äù By late 1959, Tice had become president of the organization, and not surprisingly, AHRA‚Äôs National Championships race was held at Kansas City International in 1960. The 1960 event marked the final time AHRA would be a one-race organization. The second move by AHRA was its switch of National Championship sites to Green Valley Raceway in Smithfield, Texas. If there was one track that was identified with the organization it was this one. If NHRA had Indy and IHRA had Bristol, then Green Valley was AHRA's equivalent. From 1961 through 1976, AHRA held a national event at this facility; always either its National Championship drags or its World Championships events. For 16 consecutive years, the AHRA's biggest event was always at Green Valley. Boom period In 1967, AHRA grew to five national event sites. In 1969, AHRA ballooned up to a super-healthy 10 national events, holding races at Scottsdale, Detroit, Memphis, Bristol (twice), Lions, New York National Speedway, Rockingham, and Tulsa. According to a Sept. 1968 Super Stock magazine, the AHRA Springnationals at Bristol, Tenn., had 413 classes and 15 eliminators decided on the weekend. AHRA first referred to themselves in their beginnings as ‚Äúthe only democratic national hot rod association,‚Äù and some would argue that those numbers show democracy. At the end of the 1969 season, AHRA could claim over 80 sanctioned dragstrips, over 25,000 members, and sanctioning of over 2,400 events (national and regional races). Counting its 10 national events and the countless weekly races under AHRA sanction, the outfit could boast that about 5,000,000 spectators had seen their races. AHRA held twice as many shows, but their biggest race, the AHRA Nationals, was not seen on network television like ABC‚Äôs Wide World of Sports‚Äô annual coverage of the Mac Tools U.S. Nationals. When AHRA introduced the Grand American Series of Professional Drag Racing in 1970, the sport was given its first year-long points chase that was paid off with a large season-end bonus check. The 1970 AHRA Grand American at Lions Drag Strip in Southern California ran opposite the Bakersfield U.S. Fuel and Gas Championships on March 6‚Äì8. The Lions show was one of the most pivotal in Top Fuel history. Garlits made the Top Fuel final against Richard Tharp. When the starting light went green, the transmission exploded at the line, sawing the car in two in a flash of fire and severing the top half of Garlits' right foot. This put Garlits on the shelf for most of the year. While recuperating in a Long Beach, California hospital from this violent incident, Garlits drew up the design for the modern, rear-engine Top Fuel dragster. ‚ÄúMost fans remember the ‚ÄòGreat Burndown‚Äô between me and Steve Carbone at Indy in 1971,‚Äù Garlits recalled. ‚ÄúBut do you know how much Carbone made when he won, and we‚Äôre talking here about one of the most famous Top Fuel finals in history. He got $3,000; that was it. I thought that was terrible and I just knew that NHRA, which was the bigger of the two associations, could afford to pay a lot better than that. So, I came up with the idea of the Professional Racers Association and the PRA Challenge, which I was determined to run opposite NHRA‚Äôs Nationals in 1972. I approached Jim Tice and he thought we could pull it off.‚Äù Garlits and AHRA got together and hosted the AHRA PRA National Challenge at Tulsa International Raceway on Labor Day Weekend with $35,000 going to the winners of Top Fuel, Funny Car, and Pro Stock. Overwhelmingly, their objective was achieved. Like the 1970 AHRA Grand American at Lions, the PRA race took all the top cars away from the big NHRA event at Indy that year. The Garlits PRA Challenges of 1972 and 1973 were aesthetic successes for AHRA, possibly their greatest ever, but not so financially. Not only that, but the 1973 season was hampered with weather problems. \\"We lost $3.5-million in 90 days in 1973,\\" Tice Jr. said. \\"We leased all our tracks- Tulsa, Fremont, Orange County, and it cost us around $250,000 a month in fixed overhead alone.\\" \\"It just seemed nothing went right that year. On top of all that, it rained on us in 1973 and when you're rained on in drag racing, you're screwed. As one more example, we held a Grand American at Orange County, a popular, money-making Southern California track. Unfortunately, we ran opposite the California Jam, one of those huge outdoor rock concerts, and we took a beating at the gate.\\" These considerations and the fact that they lost money both years made the decision to slide away from the PRA races easier. In 1974, Garlits moved the show up to New York National Speedway in Center Moriches, Long Island, N.Y., and the Tices hosted an AHRA Challenge at Tulsa, which was nothing more than a Grand American event that capitalized on a familiar name. The decline Given the heavy losses of 1973, AHRA needed re-financing and went for it in 1974. Since 1970 the younger Tice had headed his father's Motorsports Cuisine, a concessions business that he operated at most of the AHRA national event sites and at other venues. The senior Tice sold his company for a million dollars and with that money and some other financing, he and his son got the organization in running order again. And the organization needed the infusion, because NHRA and IHRA were starting to distance themselves from AHRA with the big financial assists they got from Winston. AHRA's method for staying afloat in its last 10 years of existence was its continued practice of buying in the race stars. They knew that a Garlits, Don Prudhomme, Bill Jenkins, or some similar talent meant, as Tice Jr. put it, \\"butts on the boards.\\" They may not have been able to match the dollars that were being pumped into the NHRA and IHRA coffers at the time, but they did have tools at their disposal to insure some profits. \\"That's the way we negotiated with the racers,\\" said Tice. \\"If you were a local pro racer without much national exposure, we couldn't give you as much as a Garlits or Prudhomme. In the late 1970s, we downsized our pro shows to eight-car fields and of those eight, we'd buy in probably half the cars.\\" The formula worked well enough. The AHRA shows of the late 1970s held up well at the gate. The big difference, though, was that NHRA and IHRA gave the fans 16 cars per pro field, better venues, and better exposure, both in the electronic and print mediums. Spokane Raceway Park was likely the last brand new state-of-the-art- type facility that AHRA was involved in before its finish. The track was top- kicked by Orville Moe, a former racer. \\"Spokane was probably the first ecologically created track,\\" Moe said. \\"Long before we ever broke ground, we had governmental studies, environmental impact, stuff like that done, and when we finished the track in early 1974, we had a one of a kind facility. It would seat 40,000 or so people and had permanent concrete restrooms and concession stands. We held the Springs race in '74 and it went off well, but it was the only race we ran that year because there were still other things to do to ready the track.\\" \\"Jim offered us the World Finals race at the beginning of 1975, and we hosted it in September, but he and I found out that a lot of racers wanted to hold it in August, when the kids were still out of school.\\" Tice Sr., and Moe had dinner at an oceanfront restaurant in Washington and agreed to an August date and the race, the AHRA or ADRA World Finals, was held there ever since until 2005. In late 1980, Jim Tice Sr., was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. As he got sicker, Jim's wife Ruth and Georgia Miller booked the racers and Jim Jr. ran the events.\\"When Jim was sick, we talked a lot with him,\\" said Moe. \\"We had a group of AHRA track operators, Tice Jr., Gerald Pritchard at Tulsa, George Eisenhardt at Dragway 42, Chuck Harmon Sr. at Kansas City, and myself, and basically it was agreed among us that we would collectively buy the business from his wife, Ruth, when he died. It looked like that was the way we were going to go, that we would run the association Grand American collectively. Ruth did want to run the track a little longer. So we figured okay, we'd help her out and keep AHRA afloat. Jim died in 1982 and we ran the organization for her until about mid-1984.\\" The AHRA track owners made up what were called the AHRA Regional Vice Presidents and their opinion on the future of the association counted for a lot. Still, there was the headquarters staff, and the actual headquarters vice-president was Don Garlits. He had a different path for Mrs. Tice and recommended that Ruth sell the association to Mike Gray, who was the president of Terminal Van Lines in Florida and very interested in buying AHRA. Gray, while a successful businessman, had limited drag racing experience, most of it centered around his backing of Bo O'Brochta's record-setting fuel motorcycle in the early 1980s. \\"We talked to her about it,\\" said Moe, \\"but she decided to go with Garlits' deal. When we heard about the deal, we talked to Gray, but at that point I decided to step away. Jim, before his death, made personal agreements that any track operator could cancel any agreements with AHRA if they were unhappy for any reason after his death, and I decided to exercise my option.\\" Tice Jr., had an explanation as to why Moe might've been unhappy with the buy- out by Gray. \\"Orville had been offered the contract by Ruth originally, but the wording stated that he would be responsible for any known and unknown debts,\\" said Jim Jr. \\"Well, there were obvious weaknesses there.\\" \\"As for myself, my dad had verbally said that I would get 25-percent, but that was not handled when he died. I had no proof short of my word. Personally, my step- mother, Ruth, and I have never been close and we did have some problems. In the last year we had AHRA, I ran it and we made in the neighborhood of $750,000, but she also had run up some huge debts and had developed some tax problems and needed money. She first offered the deal to sell AHRA to Orville, but he declined. However, along came Mike Gray and there it was.\\" Seeing the decision Mrs. Tice made, Moe, Pritchard, Harmon, Eisenhardt and the other track owners decided to go with a slightly different plan and run another association collectively. Gray had bought the \\"AHRA\\" name in mid-1984, so the old guard created the American Drag Racing Association (ADRA) and ran their own races. In Sept. 1984, Gray held his first AHRA event, and the last in the organization's history. The AHRA World Finals were held in Eunice, Louisiana, and despite having racers like Garlits, Chris Karamesines, Mark Oswald, and the final AHRA Funny Car champ John Force, the race went in the toilet. According to the event announcer Bret Kepner, the grandstands were barren. Gray decided to sue the AHRA track owners just before this event. Using Orville Moe's name as the target, he sued for a ton of money, but in the process, allegedly slandered Moe. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 1986 with the original track owners gaining the AHRA name back. In the interim years of 1985 and 1986, ADRA ran two full seasons, hosting shows at old stand- bys Tucson Dragway, Alamo Dragway, Tulsa Int'l Raceway, Kansas City Int'l Raceway, Ozark Raceway in Springfield, Missouri, Dragway 42, Spokane, and newcomer Carlsbad Raceway. However, after the 1986 season, ADRA, now back to AHRA, held only one consistent race, the AHRA World Finals at Moe's Spokane facility. \\"The big culprit was insurance,\\" said Moe. \\"Sometime in the late 1980s, it really became an issue. We had tracks in 12 states, but a number of these states got rid of the waiver / release forms that we see now at all the big races. This made the insurance companies nervous. And in so many words, they dropped racing coverage at all the tracks.\\" The association's fate seemed predetermined way back in 1985, when it ceased to exist as a national series, and yet the name lived on for another twenty years with activities limited to Spokane. Purists scoffed at the idea that the 'AHRA World Finals' should continue under the AHRA banner. After all, the association had once functioned as a true sanctioning body, with national events at member tracks that included such far- flung venues as OCIR, Beeline (Phoenix, AZ), Alamo Dragway (San Antonio, TX) and NY National Speedway out on Long Island. Yet Spokane Raceway Park's manager Orville Moe wasn't about to let a good business opportunity slip away. Although the AHRA series had ceased to exist elsewhere, he continued to stage his annual 'AHRA World Finals,' maintaining a semblance of credibility by employing Jim Tice Jr., son of the late AHRA founder. By the mid-1990s John Force was making his final pass down Spokane's asphalt and the AHRA World Finals, though heavily attended, was operating in a void. Few people outside the Northwest were even aware that the event was still alive and kicking. The AHRA name vanished at the end of 2005, dislodged from its final refuge at Spokane Raceway Park. Resurrection In late 2009 Rod Saint acquired the trademark rights to the historical 1956 organization and began an attempt to resurrect the organization. By the 2016 season, the AHRA schedule had meets in Hilo, Hawaii, Lena, Mississippi, Carlsbad, New Mexico and Deming, New Mexico.https://ahraonline.com/about/ In 2017 Dallas Brown acquired the trademark rights and started the organization in a new direction. A back to basics approach that focuses on the Sportsman classes. Currently the AHRA has meets scheduled for the 2018 season at Jeffers Motorsports Park in Sikeston, MO. Soon will have meets at North Iowa Dragway in Humboldt, IA. Sanctioned tracks are located in Hilo, Hawaii, Sikeston, Missouri, and Humboldt, IA.

The Odenton Town Center has been planned as a Town Center since 1968. In 1990, legislation created an Odenton Growth Management Area (OGMA) to encourage development in the Town Center Area. In 1995, the Odenton Town Plan was adopted. In 2004, the updated Odenton Town Center Master Plan was adopted. In July 2010 a Developer's Rights and Responsibilities Agreement (DRRA) was signed between The Halle Companies and Anne Arundel County which will allow the company to complete the stretch of Town Center Boulevard that connects the Seven Oaks Community with the Odenton MARC Station. In return, the County will be given the right to connect new water and sewer systems through the 128-acre parcel owned by The Halles. It has been reported that this is the final piece needed to allow the Odenton Town Center to move forward. Location overview Odenton Town Center is the name given to the entire Odenton Growth Management Area. The OTC is a sixteen hundred and area, located in the western part of Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Without the weir, the river would be subject to tidal fluctuations. Prior to the building of the weir, low tide would expose mudflats, which were unsightly and emitted a strong odour, particularly in the summer months. The Lagan Weir was the seen by the Laganside Corporation as a catalyst for its redevelopment projects and was judged to be the \\"centrepiece\\" of that effort.  Introduction  The Lagan Weir, completed in 1994 at a cost of ¬£14m, is located in Belfast, Northern Ireland and crosses the River Lagan between the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and the M3 cross-harbour bridge. The project was jointly funded by the Laganside Corporation and the European Commission and designed by Ferguson and McIlveen and constructed by Charles Brand Ltd. Planning for the weir commenced as early as 1988. The Prince of Wales was involved in the ceremonial setting of the first pile for the weir on 7 March 1991. The floating crane Mersey Mammoth lifted the five 32 tonne weir gates into position in May 1992. The weir gates measure 18 metres by 5 metres and were manufactured by Harland & Wolff. The Weir was officially opened in March 1994. The project included the \\"Lagan Lookout\\" on the Donegall Quay side of the river. This houses a visitors centre which has an exhibition to provide information on the function of the weir and the history of the River Lagan. The weir gate control centre, security, CCTV system and welfare facilities for River Management personnel are located on the ground floor. Equipment storage is located in the basement. The Lagan Weir consists of five weir gates and four intermediate gatehouses. A tunnel traverses under the River Lagan, which connects to both quaysides and to each of the gatehouses. Primarily, this provides access to the gatehouses for maintaining the weir gate motors.  Weir Operations  The five weir gates can each be operated independently. They are usually raised as the tide retreats in order to keep the river at a specific impoundment level. The gate operations are controlled by the River Manager. Without the weir, the river would be subject to tidal fluctuations. The tidal range is typically up to three metres between high and low tide, but the maximum tidal range can be as much as four metres. Prior to the building of the weir, low tide would expose mudflats, which were unsightly and emitted a strong odour, particularly in the summer months. On occasion, at high tide, the weir can operate as a barrage. If the river level is too high this can have such negative effects as causing erosion of the river banks, reduce air draft for vessels needing to pass under any of the river's road bridges and in extreme cases, increase the risk of flooding to low areas.  Benefits after Construction of the Weir  Construction of the weir, installation of an underwater aeration system and maintenance dredging has led to environmental improvements in terms of water quality and biodiversity. Dredging was carried out at the same time as the construction of the weir. Subsequent dredging was completed in 2010/2011 and 2019/2020. Development along the riverside has included construction of new residential towers, commercial and retail blocks, restaurants, and improved public towpaths. Date published:  Pedestrian Footbridge  A pedestrian footbridge was constructed over the weir and connects Donegall Quay with Queen's Quay. The original bridge, which was narrow and required spiral access ramps at either end, was located above the weir gates and supported by the weir gatehouse structures. This was removed in 2014 to allow the construction a new structure, which provides access for both cyclists and pedestrians. The new bridge was erected by Graham Construction at a cost of ¬£5m and is approximately 8 meters wide at its widest point.

A pseudogene for this locus is located on chromosome 18q. Thiopurine methyltransferase  Function  Thiopurine methyltransferase methylates thiopurine compounds. The methyl donor is S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is converted to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This enzyme metabolizes thiopurine drugs via S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the S-methyl donor and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as a byproduct.  Clinical significance  Thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine are used as chemotherapeutic agents and immunosuppressive drugs. Genetic polymorphisms that affect this enzymatic activity are correlated with variations in sensitivity and toxicity to such drugs within individuals. About 1/300 individual is deficient for the enzyme.  Pharmacology  TPMT is best known for its role in the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. TPMT catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs. Defects in the TPMT gene leads to decreased methylation and decreased inactivation of 6MP leading to enhanced bone marrow toxicity which may cause myelosuppression, anemia, bleeding tendency, leukopenia & infection. Allopurinol inhibits thiopurine S-methyltransferase, which can increase the utility of 6-MP. Diagnostic use Measurement of TPMT activity is encouraged prior to commencing the treatment of patients with thiopurine drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. Patients with low activity (10% prevalence) or especially absent activity (prevalence 0.3%) are at a heightened risk of drug-induced bone marrow toxicity due to accumulation of the unmetabolised drug. Reuther et al. found that about 5% of all thiopurine therapies will fail due to toxicity. This intolerant group could be anticipated by routine measurement of TPMT activity. There appears to be a great deal of variation in TPMT mutation, with ethnic differences in mutation types accounting for variable responses to 6MP. Genetic variants of TPMT have also been associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children. TPMT is now listed as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for adverse drug reactions to cisplatin by the FDA.  See also  * Cancer pharmacogenomics References Further reading *.

Dictionary of the American West. Fort Worth: TCU Press, 2008. Soddy. was an often used alternative to the log cabin during frontier settlement of the Great Plains of Canada and the United States. Primarily used at first for animal shelters, corrals, and fences, if the prairie lacked standard building materials such as wood or stone, or the poverty of the settlers precluded purchasing standard building materials, sod from thickly-rooted prairie grass was abundant, free, and could be used for house construction.Sod Houses Forest Preserve District of Cook County (Illinois) Prairie grass has a much thicker, tougher root structure than a modern lawn. A type in Alaska is a barabara. Construction of a sod house involved cutting patches of sod in rectangles, often , and piling them into walls. Builders employed a variety of roofing methods. Sod houses accommodated normal doors and windows. The resulting structure featured less expensive materials, and was quicker to build than a wood frame house. However, sod houses required frequent maintenance and were often vulnerable to rain damage, especially if the roof was also primarily of sod. Stucco was sometimes used to protect the outer walls. Canvas or stucco often lined the interior walls. While the influence of the sod house cannot be overlooked, stone or timber was preferred. Where railroads existed, allowing easy access to building materials, most houses and buildings of the period were framed.

The book is based on the story of Lance Sijan who was a United States Air Force captain in the Vietnam War. On November 9, 1967, Sijan ejected from his F-4 Phantom II at high speed and at a low altitude, which caused him to suffer massive injuries to his body. Upon waking the next morning, Sijan found that his left leg had a vertical splintering of the tibia known as a green tree fracture, his right hand was mangled with three of his fingers dislocated, and he had deep cuts and gashes in his forearms, and a severe head wound. Sijan avoided and escaped capture for nearly six weeks while crawling through jungles eating nothing but various plants and bugs before he was captured. Even after being captured and going through harsh torture, Sijan escaped once again, only to again be captured. Sijan died two weeks later in a prisoner jail in Hanoi. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor and a dormitory at his alma mater, the United States Air Force Academy, is named in his honor.

It is situated at the junction of the Dubna and Daugava rivers, approximately 170 kilometers east of Riga, the capital. Livani district is the first municipality in Latgale region coming into Livani from the Riga ‚Äì capital of Latvia side. It is like a visit card and a key in the gate to Latgale where people can go further to be acquainted with hospitable region of Latgale. Livani is a city where Dubna meets Daugava, Zemgale meets Latgale and roads go to Riga and Daugavpils, to Russia, Belarus and Lithuania. founded by Greek merchants of the same name (ŒõŒπŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ) after the Fall of Constantinople, since 2007, Livani city is a regional development centre where resources of development, social and economic activities are concentrated. Historical heritage of Livani city is being preserved in the character and structure of town planning. Spruce city public center on the Riga Street has obtained technocratic charm that expresses itself through the design of street commodities, renovated buildings and bikeways.  History  Origins of Lƒ´vƒÅni as a bigger place of population are linked to the 1533, when the then owner of the land Lieven established the manor and called it after his own name Lievenhof. The 1678, the first Catholic Church was built here. The city suffered considerably during the two world wars. Name of Lƒ´vƒÅni is associated with the glass. In 1887 a glass factory was founded here, which today has ceased operation. It was as early as in the 11th century, when settlement of traders and craftsmen was established at the current location of Lƒ´vƒÅni. The settlement belonged to the old Latgallian city-state of Jersika - it was just 7 kilometres north of the centre of Jersika state, at the place where the then significant waterways of Dubna and Daugava meet. The first documentary evidence of a fortified settlement called Dubna dates back to a later period, 1289. The beginnings of Lƒ´vƒÅni as we know it today are related to 1533, when the local German landlord Lieven founded here a hamlet and named it after himself - Lievenhof. In 1677, Lƒ´vƒÅni were transferred into the ownership of the Polish magnate Leonard Pociej. Being a Catholic Christian, in 1678 he built the first Catholic church. The church stood on the riverbank of Dubna, close to the current location of Lƒ´vƒÅni high school No.1 In those days, many beggars used to gather around the church. They used to take the food that was given to them to the riverbank of Dubna, beyond the road, there they had their meal. For that reason, the place got named \\"Beggar Bay\\" (Ubaglƒ´cis). Nowadays it is an attractive residential area. In 1824, Lƒ´vƒÅni was granted the legal status of a borough (\\"miests\\"). It was this place where the second folk-school in Latgale was established in the year 1854. Another important event was opening of the first local pharmacy in 1689. When Latvia became an independent state, the development of Lƒ´vƒÅni was fostered by the newly acquired legal status of a town (1926). Some 370 dwelling houses (most of them - wooden buildings) were built in a compact set along the main street of Lƒ´vƒÅni, Rƒ´gas iela. This street was famous for a wide range of small shops most of them owned by the local Jews. In the mid 1930s, there were around 180 shops in Lƒ´vƒÅni. The town also played the role of the regional centre of culture.  Industrial history  Lƒ´vƒÅni is a unique town due to its industrial history. Industry has been the basis for development of Lƒ´vƒÅni for almost two centuries. The local economy experienced a strong boost soon as the result of the opening of Riga - Orel railroad in 1861 and the drastic reforms of the 1860s, i.a. the abolishment of serfdom. The industrial growth was stimulated by the good traffic connections both via roads and waterways, the cheap labour coming from Vidzeme and Kurzeme regions as well as the rich local natural resources. For production purposes, it was possible to use woods available in the closest neighbourhood of Lƒ´vƒÅni, besides additional wood supplies were brought by Dubna and Daugava rivers. Huge reserves of clay, dolomite, sand and peat were available there thus ensuring raw materials for production of construction materials, glass and peat. Until the early 1920s, 10 new factories were built in Lƒ´vƒÅni; the biggest of them were pulp plant (established in 1872), glass factory (1887), wood-processing plant, and facilities for production of linoleum, bricks and textile products. In Me≈Üƒ∑i, which is on the left riverbank of Daugava opposite to Lƒ´vƒÅni, a French company built a horn factory, which produced buttons for corselets, hats and telephones and was the only of its kind in the entire Europe. During the World War I, the local factories were closed and their equipment was evacuated to Russia. For two and a half years, Lƒ´vƒÅni remained in the front-line zone. Constant shooting was the reason for destruction of some 155 buildings. After the war, there were only 1880 inhabitants in Lƒ´vƒÅni. The business ceased to flourish in Lƒ´vƒÅni along the advent of the World War II that left a half of the town in ruins. The Soviet occupation was not encouraging either; the old buildings and scenery on the riverbanks of Dubna and Daugava were gradually spoiled. In the 1970s, standardised 5-storey buildings were built instead of the dwelling houses demolished in the southern part of the town. That coincided with the establishment of huge industrial facilities in Lƒ´vƒÅni. In the 1970s and 1980s a new biochemical plant, a production site for constructional materials and a building company were created there. The latter was specialised in building the so-called \\"Lƒ´vƒÅni houses\\", which were very popular in the 1980s. The oldest industrial site in the town, the flass factory was extended. Lƒ´vƒÅni became the third industrial centre of Latgale, next after second largest city of Latgale - Daugavpils and Rƒìzekne. Spatial organisation of Lƒ´vƒÅni town Lƒ´vƒÅni is a typical example of the so-called linear towns. Such structure has been determined by its location on the riverbank of Daugava, on both sides of the motorway/rail road Rƒ´ga - Daugavpils. This transit route is, at the same time, the central street of Lƒ´vƒÅni (Rƒ´gas iela), and the central axis for planning building activities. The \\"centre\\" of the town, where the most important service providers ar located, is spread in length along the main street and its closest proximity. Thus, the town has a single centre, however, it has no exact borderlines. Lƒ´vƒÅni is crossed by two main roads, national highway A6 Rƒ´ga - Daugavpils and motorway P63 Lƒ´vƒÅni - Preiƒºi. In 2003, reconstruction works were carried out for the bridge over Dubna river and Riga street, which now are in a good condition. In addition, the street lighting system on Lƒ´vƒÅni streets has been significantly improved over the last years. Total length of roads and streets in Lƒ´vƒÅni is 38,5 km. Some 84% of all roads in the town are covered with bituminious concrete; the other roads are covered by broken stones. Feedback gathered from the local business people indicates that they find maintenance of municipal roads, in particular grading, replacement of damaged segments of concrete cover and snow removal during winter season, satisfactory. The town is also crossed by a 4,8 km long railway segment. Total area covered by rail tracks is very impressive, they account for 5% of the total area of Lƒ´vƒÅni. The local rail station is managing transit movement of cargoes and passengers, transportation services to the industrial enterprises in the town and the district. There are five rail tracks in the territory of the train station, including one main railroad and twenty switchpoints. Total length of rail tracks at the station is 2,500 meters. The local railroads are getting overloaded during the last years : daily throughput of Lƒ´vƒÅni station is 48 cargo trains and 12 passenger trains. In order to solve road-crossing problems caused by the increasing traffic density, Lƒ´vƒÅni District Council is planning to build a two-level rail crossing there. During summer season, the two riverbanks of Daugava are connected by a ferry Lƒ´vƒÅni - DignƒÅja, the straightest way from Latgale to Zemgale (in particular its sub-region Sƒìlija). This ferry is an important means of transportation for the people living on both sides of Daugava, both for pedestrians, car drivers and cyclists.

Though Europeans had visited Australia before 1788, there is no evidence of any Jewish sailors among the crew. The first Jews known to have come to Australia came as convicts transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet that established the first European settlement on the continent, on the site of present-day Sydney. There were 97,335 Australians who identified themselves as Jewish in the 2011 census, but the actual number is estimated to be 112,000. (An answer to the question on the census was optional.) The majority are Ashkenazi Jews, many of them refugees and Holocaust survivors(some having arrived via the Dunera or their descendants) who arrived during and after World War II, and their descendants. Jewish citizens make up about 0.5% of the Australian population. History Major general histories of the Jews in Australia are Hilary L. Rubinstein and William D. Rubinstein, The Jews in Australia: A Thematic History (2 vols., 1991) and Suzanne D. Rutland, Edge of the Diaspora: Two Centuries of Jewish Settlement in Australia (2001; first ed. 1988). Each of these academic historians has written more concise general histories also, with Hilary L. Rubinstein's Chosen: The Jews in Australia (1987) being the first overall history of Australian Jewry, and described by Rabbi Raymond Apple as skilfully and stylishly weaving together the strands of the story of a colourful minority group and its interaction with general society. Rabbi John Simon Levi, co-author of Australian Genesis: Jewish Convicts and Settlers, 1788-1850 (1974) has authored the magisterial biographical directory, These Are The Names: Jewish Lives in Australia, 1788-1860 (2013). The Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal (started 1939) appears twice a year, published in Sydney and Melbourne respectively. There are also a number of published monographs on aspects of Australian Jewish history, for a guide to which (as well as to Australian Jewish literature) Serge Liberman, A Bibliography of Australasian Judaica, 1788-2008 (2011) is a distinguished reference work. =Colonial era= Australian Jews never constituted more than 1% of the total colonial community. Eight convicts transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet have been identified as Jewish. There were probably more, but exact numbers are not possible as the transportation records did not indicate a convict's religion. Over a thousand more people of Jewish descent are estimated to have been sent to Australia as convicts during the next 60 years. Most of them came from London, were of working-class background and were male. Only 7% of Jewish convicts were female, compared to 15% for non-Jewish convicts. The average age of the Jewish convicts was 25, but ranged as young as 8 to some elderly people.Rutland, Suzanne, 2005, The Jews in Australia, . Esther Abrahams (who arrived with the First Fleet, with her baby daughter Roseanna) and Ikey Solomon were among the convicts who were Jewish. At first, the Church of England was the established religion in the colony, and during the early years of transportation all convicts were required to attend Anglican services on Sundays. This included Irish Catholics as well as Jews. Similarly, education in the new settlement was Anglican church-controlled until the 1840s. The first move towards organisation in the community was the formation of a Chevra Kadisha (a Jewish burial society) in Sydney in 1817. In 1820, William Cowper allotted land for the establishment of a Jewish cemetery in the right-hand corner of the then- Christian cemetery. The Jewish section was created to enable the burial of one Joel Joseph. During the next ten years there was no great increase in membership of the society, and its services were not called for more than once a year. The actual allocation of land for a consecrated Jewish cemetery was not approved until 1832.V.D. Lipman, A Social History of the Jews of England, 1850‚Äì1950, London, 1954, p.121. York Street Synagogue, Sydney, 1840s The first Jewish services in the colony were conducted from 1820 in private homes by emancipist Joseph Marcus, one of the few convicts with Jewish knowledge. An account of the period is: :\\"In 1827 and 1828 then the worldly condition of the Hebrews in the colony improved considerably, in consequence of the great influx of respectable merchants; and this, with other circumstances, has raised the Hebrews in the estimation of their fellow colonists. About this period Mr. P. J. Cohen having offered the use of his house for the purpose, divine worship was performed for the first time in the colony according to the Hebrew form, and was continued regularly every Sabbath and holiday. From some difference of opinion then existing among the members of this faith, divine service was also performed occasionally in a room hired by Messrs. A. Elias and James Simmons. In this condition everything in connection with their religion remained until the arrival of Rev. Aaron Levi, in the year 1830. He had been a dayyan, and, duly accredited, he succeeded in instilling into the minds of the congregation a taste for the religion of their fathers. A Sefer Torah [scroll of the Law] was purchased by subscription, divine service was more regularly conducted, and from this time may be dated the establishment of the Jewish religion in Sydney. In 1832 they formed themselves into a proper congregation, and appointed Joseph Barrow Montefiore as the first president.\\" In 1832, the first Jewish wedding in Australia was celebrated, the contracting parties being Moses Joseph and Rosetta Nathan. Three years later a Mr. Rose came from England and acted as the chazzan, shochet, and mohel. He was succeeded by Jacob Isaacs. Great Synagogue, Elizabeth Street, Sydney, constructed in 1878. Over the following decades, the community's numbers increased, primarily as a result of Jewish immigration from the United Kingdom and Germany. Kehillas (organized communities) began to be established in Sydney (1831) and Melbourne (1841). The condition of the Jewish community improved to such an extent that in 1844 the first synagogue was formed in York Street, Sydney using rented space, which continued in use for more than thirty years. The 1841 census shows that New South Wales Jewry accounted for 65.3% of the total Australian Jewish population, and 0.57% of the total Australian population. In 1848, there were 200 Jews in Victoria, and they formed the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society to provide assistance to those in need. Jewish Care - Our history Although the Jewish community was primarily Ashkenazi, some Sephardi Jews also immigrated to Australia, and the community thrived during the mid-to-late 19th century. For some twenty years, there was a Sephardic congregation, and some Sephardi families occupied important communal positions. Gradually, however, the Sephardi population declined, and the congregation was disbanded in 1873. The gold rush of the 1850s attracted a wave of immigrants, and Jewish immigrants soon outnumbered native-born Jews. Initially, they settled in rural areas, but by the end of the 19th century the lack of Jewish communal connections and fear of assimilation led most Australian Jews in rural areas to relocate to the Jewish centres in cities. As a result, the rapidly growing community in Sydney needed larger facilities, and built the Great Synagogue, located on Elizabeth Street, opposite Hyde Park, which was consecrated in 1878. Brisbane's First Synagogue in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home on North Quay, 1930 When Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859, Jewish people began to settle in Brisbane, forming the Brisbane Hebrew Congregation in 1865. The congregation used a number of venues as temporary places of worship, including a building in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home at North Quay (the house later known as Aubigny), while raising money through various land speculations to purchase a site and build a synagogue. They purchased land in Margaret Street for ¬£200 and in 1885 called for designs, choosing the plans of Arthur Morry, an architect who worked for the Queensland Colonial Architect. Arthur Midson, a prominent Brisbane building contractor, built the Synagogue for the sum of ¬£6450. The Brisbane Synagogue was consecrated on 18 July 1886, its spiritual name being \\"Kehilla Kedosha Sha'ari Emuna\\" (The Holy Congregation of the Gates of Faith). The Jewish press in Australia was pioneered in Melbourne. In 1895, Sydney's first Jewish newspaper, called the Hebrew Standard of Australasia, was published, and is the forerunner of The Australian Jewish News.Brisbane Synagogue, 2012 At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, as Australia was unifying its colonies into a single independent country, a new wave of Jewish immigration began. Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland began arriving in the 1890s, fleeing pogroms in their native lands. This immigration wave led to a divide among urban Jewish communities. Most Jews in Sydney were from Western and Central Europe, and were largely secular. Meanwhile, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe settled in Melbourne, and were highly Orthodox. In addition, thousands of highly observant Jews immigrated from South Africa and settled in Perth.St Kilda Synagogue.Jews also began to assemble in Melbourne, then in the Port Phillip District (now Victoria). The Melbourne Hebrew Congregation was formed in 1841, and the first synagogue building opened in 1847 at 472 Bourke Street, with a seating capacity of 100. Other synagogues were built in Hobart (1845), Launceston (1846) and Adelaide (1850).History, Adelaide Hebrew Congregation. Retrieved 9 August 2020. With the arrival of large numbers of immigrants in the 1850s, especially during the Victorian Gold Rush, there was a need for a larger synagogue in Melbourne. Construction of a larger 600 seat synagogue at South Yarra commenced in March 1855. Other Jewish congregations were formed in Geelong, Bendigo, and Ballarat (1853). The East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation split from the Bourke St congregation in 1857. The St Kilda Hebrew Congregation was formed in 1871, with the first services held in St Kilda Town Hall and the building of a permanent building in Charnwood Road, St Kilda, commencing in 1872.St Kilda Shule Since the 1850s, Melbourne has had the largest Jewish population in the country. A religious court (Beth Din) was set up in Melbourne in 1866. =20th century= By 1901 it is estimated there were over 15,000 Jews in Australia. When Australia was founded as an independent country in 1901, some of the founders were Jewish. From the outset, Jews were treated as equal citizens with freedom to participate in economic and cultural life, and played an important role in their development. Anti-semitism, which was common in contemporary Europe, was very rare in Australia. Following World War I, another stream of Jewish immigrants came, and when the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, many German Jews came to Australia. The Australian government was initially hesitant in permitting entry to the many Jews who wanted to come, but in 1938, it allotted 15,000 visas for \\"victims of oppression\\". Some 7,000 Jews were able to take up the visas before the outbreak of World War II put an end to the program. In the aftermath of World War II Australia abandoned its previous Anglo-centric immigration policy and permitted immigration of large numbers of people from continental Europe. Large numbers of European Jews, survivors of the Holocaust, arrived in the country from displaced persons camps, but there was an outbreak of antisemitism. For example, the Returned Services League and other groups published cartoons to encourage the government and the immigration Minister Arthur A. Calwell to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants. Organizations during WWII tried to help children affected by the war by bringing them to Australia but were only able to after the war ended. During WWII transportation for civilians was limited, so no Jewish orphans could be brought over even though the Australian government increased their allowance quota for orphaned children. After the war, the pre-war anti-Jewish refugee sentiment influenced the government's choice not to fund any Jewish immigration, saying it was the Jewish community's responsibility to bring over the refugees. This made it so sponsors and organizations were the ones to help fund the Jewish refugee's journey and settlement into the Australia Jewish community. From 1938 to 1961 the Jewish population almost tripled in size from the 1933 population to 61,000 Jews living in Australia. Organizations during the war tried to bring over and place children affected by the war, but were only able to after the war ended. Two organizations assisting with the immigration, specifically of orphaned children were Save the Children‚Äôs Scheme and the Jewish Welfare Guardian Scheme, who brought over a total of 317 orphaned Jewish children from Europe in the years after the war. The girls brought over were placed into orphanages, while the boys were placed into hostels, where they lived with other holocaust survivors. In 1940 there were 2,500 German and Austrian refugee internees including 1,750 Jewish Refugees, known as the Dunera internees, were all immediately sent to an internment camp in Hay Australia. Givat Zion Synagogue, Greenslopes, Queensland.A large number of the new immigrants were observant Jews, and day-school attendance rose steadily. A new Sephardic community also emerged in the post-war period. Previously, Mizrahi Jews were generally not permitted to enter due to Australia's White Australia policy. However, following the Suez Crisis in 1956, a number of Egyptian Jews were allowed to enter. Over the following years, overtures from Jewish communities led the government to drop its previous stance on entry of Mizrahi Jews. By 1969, when Iraqi Jews were being persecuted, the government granted refugee status to Iraqi Jews who managed to reach Australia. In the 1970s, the Australian Jewish community was concerned by the rising intermarriage rate which impacted the numbers of Jews with bonds to the community. By the early 1980s, intermarriage again dropped to one of the lowest rates in the diaspora. The community was further bolstered by immigration from South Africa, and starting in 1989, from the former Soviet Union. Throughout the 20th century, many Jews served as elected officials. Among the positions held by a Jew were Mayor of Melbourne, Premier of South Australia, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Speaker of Parliament. Many Jewish elected officials simultaneously served as the heads of their kehillas. However, the successful integration of Jews into Australian society led to a rise in assimilation. Intermarriage rates rose, synagogue attendance dropped, and many Jews stopped practicing Judaism altogether. However, there were still many who chose to remain observant. =Recent history= JewishCare is among Australia's largest and oldest Jewish aid organisations, started in 1935 as the Australian Jewish Welfare Society to assist with Jewish migration from Nazi Germany. It is still engaged in assisting migrants and providing other welfare services. The Jewish community's Jewish Museum of Australia opened in Melbourne in 1982 and the Sydney Jewish Museum opened in 1992 to commemorate the Holocaust, as well as to \\"challenge visitors' perceptions of democracy, morality, social justice and human rights\\". There was an increase in immigration from Australia to Israel in 2010, when 240 Australians moved to Israel, up from 165 in 2009. In 27 November 2016, the Annual Report of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) on Antisemitism in Australia, reported that in the 12-month period ending 30 September 2016 there was a 10% increase in anti-Semitic incidents in Australia involving threats or acts of violence over the previous year. Public life Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire. Vaiben Solomon served briefly as South Australia's premier in 1899. Sir John Monash in 1918. Monash was one of the most distinguished Allied commanders of the Western Front during World War I. Jews have also figured prominently in Australian honours and include Nobel Prize winner Bernard Katz. Besides his diverse business interests in Sydney, Sir Saul Samuel was the first Jew to become a magistrate, to sit in a colonial Parliament and to become a minister of the Crown. In 1854 he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council and subsequently was an elected member of the Legislative Assembly. He also served periods as Treasurer and Postmaster General. Vaiben Solomon was Premier of South Australia for a week in 1899. Leo Port was Lord Mayor of Sydney between 1975 and 1978. In 1931, Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian-born Governor- General, and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire. Sir Zelman Cowen also served as Governor-General, between 1977 and 1982. Linda Dessau has been Governor of Victoria since July 2015, the first woman and the first Jew to serve in the position. Sir John Monash, a distinguished Australian Lieutenant-General during World War I, led Australian troops both in Gallipoli and on the Western Front. The agent-generalship of New South Wales has been administered by two Jews: Sir Saul Samuel, one of the most prominent and successful Jews in Australian politics, and Sir Julian Salomons. Several Jews have served as Chief Justices of various states. Sir Julian Salomons was Chief Justice of New South Wales for a fortnight in 1886; James Spigelman was the Chief Justice of NSW from 19 May 1998 to 31 May 2011. Mahla Pearlman was Chief Judge of the NSW Land and Environment Court from 1992 to 2003, and she was the first woman chief judge in any (State) jurisdiction in Australia. Jews are especially prominent in the legal profession; for example, in Melbourne alone, the Hon. Michael Rozenes sits as Chief Judge of the County Court of Victoria, Justice Redlich sits on the Court of Appeal, while Justices Raymond Finkelstein, Alan Goldberg, Mark Weinberg, Ronald Sackville and Ron Merkel have all sat in recent years on the Federal Court of Australia. James Edelman is a justice of the Federal Court, and is appointed to be a justice of the High Court of Australia. David Bennett is a Sydney barrister. He was president of the Australian Bar Association from 1995 to 1996 and of the NSW Bar Association from 1995 to 1997. Bennett was president of the Association of Lawyer Arbitrators and Mediates in 1998 and President of the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences from 1999 to 2001. He was Solicitor-General of Australia from 1998 to 2008. Bennett was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2003. His wife, Annabelle Bennett is a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia. Commerce Among the Jews who have figured as business pioneers in Australia were Joseph Barrow Montefiore (1803‚Äì1893)Israel Getzler, 'Montefiore, Joseph Barrow (1803‚Äì1893)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 10 May 2013 and his brother Jacob Barrow Montefiore (1801‚Äì1895), one of the founders of the colony of South Australia, as he was selected by the British government to act on the first board of commissioners, appointed in 1835 to conduct its affairs. Jacob's portrait hangs in the Art Gallery of South Australia, and his memory is perpetuated by Montefiore Hill, a vantage point which overlooks the city of Adelaide. Their nephew Jacob Levi Montefiore (1819‚Äì1885), whose mother was a first cousin of Sir Moses Montefiore,Martha Rutledge, 'Montefiore, Jacob Levi (1819‚Äì1885)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 10 May 2013 and J. B. Montefiore gave an impetus to the progress of New South Wales. Jacob owned one of the largest sheep-runs in the colony, and founded and for many years acted as director of the Bank of Australasia. The close connection of these two with the colony is further evidenced by the township of Montefiore, New South Wales, which stands at the junction of the Bell and Macquarie Rivers in the Wellington valley. Joseph Montefiore was the first president of the first Jewish congregation formed in Sydney in 1832. V. L. Solomon of Adelaide is remembered for the useful work he achieved in exploring the vast northern territory of his colony, the interests of which he represented in Parliament. M. V. Lazarus of Bendigo, known as Bendigo Lazarus, also did much to open up new parts in the back country of Victoria. Nathaniel Levi, for many years urged the cultivation of beetroot for the production of sugar and spirits owed its brief existence as an industry to Levi's own interest in raw material for his distilling company. In his labours on behalf of this industry he published in 1870 a work of 250 pages on the value and adaptability of the sugar-beet. In Western Australia, the townships of Karridale and Boyanup owe their existence to the enterprise of M. C. Davies, a large lumber merchant. Arts and culture Isaac Nathan c. 1820.National Library of Australia nla.pic- an2292675 Artist unknown, probably one of Lord Byron's portraitists. Barnett Levy founded an early theatre in Australia. He was refused a license by then governor Darling in 1828, though in the following year he was permitted to hold approved performances in his Sydney Hotel. A record of the event is found in an entry in \\"Sydney in 1848\\", a work published in that year: \\"In the late twenties His Excellency Sir R. Bourke granted Barnett Levy a license for dramatic performances, with a restriction that he should confine himself to the representation of such pieces only as had been licensed in England by the Lord Chamberlain.\\" Levy was at that time the owner of the original Royal Hotel in George Street; and he fitted up the saloon of that establishment as a theatre, where the first representations of the legitimate drama in the colony were given. The encouragement that this undertaking received induced the enterprising proprietor to enlarge his sphere of activity. He built a theatre called the Theatre Royal, which was opened in 1833, at a cost which almost bankrupted him. Isaac Nathan, who emigrated to Australia in 1841, wrote the first Australian opera, Don John of Austria to a libretto by Jacob Levi Montefiore. It premiered on 3 May 1847 at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney. There have been Jewish contributions to Australian visual arts. Georges Mora, born Gunter Morawski in 1913 in Leipzig, Germany of Jewish/Polish heritage, fled Germany to Paris in 1930, then to Melbourne in 1949. He established the Tolarno Gallery in Melbourne's bohemian St Kilda. This became a venue for exhibitions of Australian Modernist avant garde art. His wife, Mirka Mora, became a prominent artist and remains so, today. Printmaker and projection artist Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack graduate and professor of the Bauhaus was deported to Australia as an \\"enemy alien\\" on the ship HMT Dunera, spending time in internment camps in Hay, Orange and Tatura, before being sponsored for Australian citizenship by (Sir) James Darling, headmaster of Geelong Church of England Grammar School. He was influential in the introduction of Bauhaus principles into visual art and design curricula in Australia. E. P. Fox and Abbey Alston have achieved distinction. Paintings by both these artists have been hung in the Melbourne National Gallery. In the Adelaide Gallery hangs a tribute to the memory of H. Abrahams for the services he rendered to the progress of art in Australia. Two Jews of Australian birth have attained to some distinction as writers, S. Alexander and Joseph Jacobs. There has always been a thriving Australian Jewish media sector. From the Australian Jewish news \\\\- Australia's largest, and longest running hard copy publication, to radio shows, online magazines, periodicals, and blogs, Jewish Australians have been dedicated contributors to media intended for internal communal consumption, as well as the wider Australian society. In May 2004, art collector and dealer, Joseph Brown, donated his substantial collection of Australian art of the 20th century to the National Gallery of Victoria. It was the largest single gift of works of art ever made to a public gallery in Australia. Brown migrated from Poland in 1933. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his services to the arts. Antisemitism Since the days of European settlement in Australia, Jews have enjoyed formal equality before the law and have not been subject to civil disabilities or other forms of state-sponsored antisemitism excluding them from full participation in public life. Jews have been active contributors in science, art, and literature, and in the government of the colonial and Commonwealth eras, with a number attaining prominent public offices, including several governors-general. Despite this tolerant ethos, Australia rejected a Jewish refugee resettlement proposal, during World War II. Post-war Jewish immigration came at a time when antisemitism was rife, with the Returned Services League publishing cartoons to encourage the government and Immigration Minister Arthur A. Calwell to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants. Attacks on Jewish property and institutions increased with tensions in the Middle East, with corresponding increases in security precautions. In 1975, ASIO documents revealed that Palestinian terrorists planned to kill high- profile Jewish figures including the Israeli ambassador Michael Elizur and \\"Zionist spokesmen\\" Isi Leibler and Sam Lipski. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, \\"one of Israel's most vocal supporters\\", was also considered for attack.Nicholson, Brendan: Palestinian plot to kill Hawke The Age, 1 January 2007 The Australian Jewish community tends to experience surges in attacks on synagogues, Jewish schools and institutions and violence against persons during times of hostility in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict,Skelton, Russell; Smiles, Sarah: Sydney synagogue rocked by attack, The Age, 1 August 2006 which, however, has been significantly less pronounced than in Western Europe and North America. The Jewish community in Melbourne supports an \\"anti- defamation commission\\" (ADC) which makes monthly reports to police of offensive graffiti found in public toilets and elsewhere.‚ÄòBest Jew is a dead Jew‚Äô The Australian Jewish News, 12 February 2012 There have been numerous incidences of antisemitic activities on university campuses. For example, antisemitic material had been found on five university campuses in March 2017. =Attacks on Australian Jews= 1989 - A series of attacks occurred in Sydney including the firebombing of a Jewish girl's high school, the apparent firebombing of a Jewish youth club, a bomb threat to Jewish shops which had their windows smashed with bricks, and the distribution of antisemitic material and stickers with the word \\"Jew\\" on it.\\"Racists attacks on Jewish property.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald 1990 - Fire was set to synagogue in Melbourne. Four Molotov cocktails were thrown through window of a synagogue in Melbourne. 1999 - An explosive device was placed in a letterbox of a synagogue. 2001 - A series of firebomb attacks occurred at a synagogue and a Jewish community centre. 2003 - Arson attacks occurred on synagogues. 2010 - A synagogue in Sydney's north shore was egged over Sabbath evening. 2014 - Ismail Al-Wahwah, a spokesperson for the Islamist group Hizb ut‚ÄôTahrir, gave public speech in July 2014 vilifying Jews and calling for their deaths. A complaint was lodged by the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies with the NSW Anti- Discrimination Board (ADB) in March 2015. Although the ADB considered that the law had been breached, no prosecution was brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) or the police. Synagogues and religious affiliation Until the 1930s, all synagogues in Australia were nominally Orthodox, with most acknowledging leadership of the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom. To this day the vast majority of synagogues in Australia are Orthodox. However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including Mizrachi, Chabad and Adass Israel congregations. There are also Sephardi congregations. There had been short-lived efforts to establish Reform congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a sustained liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel was established in Melbourne. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the Reform Movement, Temple Emanuel, was established in Sydney in 1938. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.Rubinstein and Freeman, (Editors), \\"A Time to Keep: The story of Temple Beth Israel: 1930 to 2005\\" A Special publication of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, 2005. Since 1992 Conservative (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney. In 1999, Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne's first Conservative (Masorti) Congregation was established, with foundation president Prof John Rosenberg. The congregation appointed its first rabbi, Ehud Bandel in 2006. In 2010 Beit Knesset Shalom became Brisbane's first Conservative (Masorti) synagogue. In 2012, the first humanistic Jewish congregation, known as Kehilat Kolenu, was established in Melbourne with links to the cultural Jewish youth movement Habonim Dror. Later in 2012, a similar congregation was established in Sydney, known as Ayelet HaShachar. The services are loosely based on the Humanistic Jewish movement in the United States and the musical- prayer group Nava Tehila in Israel.

Antrim in the province of Ulster in Ireland, who wrote in English and Ulster Scots. His most famous poem was The Irishman. He was the foremost of the Ulster Weaver Poets, and was writing contemporaneously with Robert Burns. According to that other great Ulster poet, John Hewitt, he produced some material that was better than Burns. Orr joined the Irish nationalist Society of United Irishmen in 1791 and took part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The United Army of Ulster, of which he was a part, was defeated at the Battle of Antrim and after a time hiding from the authorities, he fled to America. He remained there for a short time, earning a living by working for a newspaper, but returned to Ballycarry in 1802 under an amnesty. He died in Ballycarry in 1816 at the age of 46. An imposing monument to Orr, erected by local Freemasons in 1831, is sited in the Templecorran cemetery near Ballycarry, in memory of the great Mason and Ulster Weaver Poet.

She works for what is arguably Argentina's largest television network, Telef√©. Biography As an actress, Maciel debuted with an extra role as a servant in 2003's Resistir√©, which was renamed in English to Forever Julia. It wasn't long before she was able to find a job as a recurrent character. During 2004, she was hired to play Pepa Kathy in her second telenovela, named El Deseo (The Desire). Although El Deseo was not as large a hit as Resistir√©, it helped Maciel's career by making her a familiar figure among Argentine television viewers. Maciel then debuted as a television reporter in a show named Camara en Mano (Handheld Camera) during 2005. In Camara en Mano, she and a number of other reporters visit celebrities, both national and international, often by surprise, and with a handheld camera, as the show's title suggests. More often than not, Maciel's (as well as the other reporters') interviews to celebrities are mixed with both serious and funny questions. As reporter for Camara en Mano, Maciel has covered many different topics, such as karate, women's boxing, and Argentina's version of the Oscar awards, the Ace awards. She managed to spot and interview the international singer, Sandro, as he was about to get into his private swimming pool, and she has also interviewed Marcela Acuna and Facundo Arana, among many others.

American Laser Games released a sequel, Crime Patrol 2: Drug Wars later that year. Storyline The player character is employed in the police force and works his way up from Rookie to Delta Force, achieved through systematically neutralizing threats which appear in various environments and scenarios. As a Rookie, the player character teams up with a somewhat boisterous policewoman, taking on burglars, armed robbers, and gang members. After getting promoted to Undercover, the player character gets a slightly overweight male partner and confronts drug smugglers and crime lords in a nightclub, chop shop, and airfield. Next, in SWAT, bank robbers, meth cooks, and outlaw bikers become the enemies. Finally, in Delta Force, the player must stand up to serious threats to national security, such as a hijacked shipment of nuclear material, hijacked planes, and assassination attempts. Each part of the game is made up of three separate scenarios, with one final mission involving a plot to steal plutonium that is filmed partly in night vision. Gameplay The CD-i, 3DO, Sega CD, and PC versions use a mouse or light gun to aim and shoot the villains. Reloading is done by moving the light gun outside of the screen and pressing the trigger; this is also achieved when using the mouse by directing the cursor to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen and right-clicking. The player can reload at any time and an infinite number of times. The player has three lives at their disposal. There are four levels, not counting the shooting range, which one can access to improve one's aim and reflexes. Once the player has completed a scene, on the selection screen the icon is closed off, being stamped with the words \\"CASE CLOSED\\", but if the player waits too long to choose another scene, a completed case may automatically begin. Release A port for the Atari Jaguar CD was reportedly in development but never released. A port for the Sega Saturn was also slated for Christmas 1996, but was cancelled at the last minute. Reception GamePro panned the Sega CD version, citing poor acting, corny dialogue, excessively grainy graphics, inaccurate controls when using a standard gamepad instead of a light gun, and generic light gun shooter gameplay. The same GamePro reviewer leveled all the same criticisms at the 3DO version except for the graphics, remarking that the 3DO version has \\"clean, sharp, digitized images\\". A reviewer for Next Generation gave the 3DO version two out of five stars, criticizing the poor acting and overt similarity to previous American Laser Games offerings. Though he admitted that the game is decently fun with a 3DO light gun, and that the video contains several entertaining stunts, he concluded, \\"Personally, we'd rather rent Commando again.\\" Maximum dubbed the PC version \\"one of the best arcade conversions, ever\\" but derided the shallow and lowbrow nature of the game itself. They described the line of American Laser Games light gun games as \\"lineal descendants of fairground shooting galleries. Substitute the moving ducks and gats for an episode of Starsky & Hutch and a plastic pistol ... and you have grasped the essence of the thing.\\" However, they acknowledged that this style of game has its appeal and concluded, \\"No intellectual challenges here, folks, but for the right kind of homo-couchpotatus, Crime Patrol is a satisfying piece of idle machismo.\\" They gave it three out of five stars.

It is endemic to the Eastern Unites States. It is named in honor of Richard White Wehrle (1852‚Äì1937), a jeweler, naturalist, and collector of the holotype. Geographic range Wehrle's salamander ranges from New York south to Virginia. Populations in southwestern Virginia and northwestern North Carolina were reclassified as a distinct species, the Blacksburg salamander (P. jacksoni), which has been reaffirmed by a study published in 2019. An isolated cave-dwelling population in Virginia was also reclassified as distinct species, the Dixie Cavern salamander (P. dixi), also reaffirmed by a study published in 2019. The population on the Cumberland Plateau, formerly considered a yellow-spotted color morph, is now considered a new species, the yellow-spotted woodland salamander (P. pauleyi), which was described during the 2019 study. Description It is bluish-black with big, scattered white spots on its back. Its sides are covered with white to yellow spots and blotches. Its belly and the ventral surface of the tail are solid gray, and the throat and upper chest usually have white or yellowish blotches.Conant, Roger. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. The species grows to a length of . Reproduction Mating occurs from fall through spring. A large cluster of eggs is laid in early summer in damp logs, soils or moss, and in crevices in caves. Reproduction is biennial or irregular, with many mature females failing to breed each year. Behavior and habitat This species stays under cover during the day, and comes out to forage at night. This species is found on forested hillsides in the Appalachian Plateau, where it hides by day beneath stones or rocks. It is also found at the entrances of caves and deep rock crevices, as well as burrows under rocks and logs. References * Fowler, Henry W., and Emmett Reid Dunn. 1917. \\"Notes on salamanders\\".

Albertini played drums on three tracks for 1998's Stratosphere, and with 1999's 1975, became much more involved in the group process, playing many more instruments and sharing recording/producing credits with Parton and Amber. By 2000's Contemporary Movement he was fully involved in the creative process as a permanent member of the group. Members of the band previously performed together in the group Mohinder, as well as releasing two albums under the name Valium Aggelein. Parton also tinkers with his side project Eiafuawn and plays drums and tours with punk band El Buzzard. Albertini has his own band Helvetia that has put out multiple records on Parton's record label The Static Cult Label and plays keyboards/drums with Mike Johnson. Parton and Amber also run the Low Earth Orbit recording studio. On April 13, 2018, Duster posted via their Instagram page that they are ‚Äúrecording a little bit‚Äù. Later it was announced that the band's discography would be reissued as the box set Capsule Losing Contact through The Numero Group, which was released on March 22, 2019. On July 4, 2019, the band released their first standalone single in almost 20 years \\"Interstellar Tunnel\\", and subsequently announced their third self-titled studio album, which was released on December 13 that year. Of their hiatus and subsequent reunion, Parton said, \\"When we took a break almost two decades ago, we didn't think it was going to all completely stop. We thought we could keep it drifting at least, maybe at a slower pace and with a different process. But everything just went dark. We were always in touch and sometimes we'd talk about doing Duster things, but days just piled up... In recent years we've talked more seriously about at least doing another record. Now everything is sort of working out, and we are making new things together, but we're taking it slow and still doing most things wrong, so it does feel like right where we left off.\\" Generally seen as indie rock, the group has been also associated with the space rock and slowcore movements by critics due to their unique sound. To produce this, the band typically recorded on cheap and older recording equipment, such as cassette decks, in their Low Earth Orbit studio.

According to Kia Abdullah cultural Muslims tend to feel close connection with the some of the positive values they were raised with in their childhood but are no longer feel connected with faith strongly enough. Kia Abdullah says some are just not practicing, some may be agnostic and some may be even atheists. Kia Abdullah says unlike Ex-Muslims, cultural Muslims may not wish to have complete disassociation with Islam. Even though cultural Muslims are non-practicing or liberal in practice, want to remain emotionally connected with community and cultural heritage. As Kia Abdullah quotes journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown's example may be a cultural Muslim does not fast but still keeps attachment to Islamic values, and term 'cultural Muslim' provides space and identity to them. Kia Abdullah says that actually many non-practicing would be there as cultural Muslim but do not identify so for lack of theological literacy needed to establish right to exist so and secondly sheer fear of reprisal. Cultural Muslims can be found across the world, but are especially numerous in the Middle East (Arabic-speaking countries as well as in Israel, Turkey and Iran), Europe, Central Asia, North America, and parts of South and Southeast Asia. Definition In Central Asia and in former communist countries, the term \\"cultural Muslim\\" came into use to describe those who wished their \\"Muslim\\" identity to be associated with certain national and ethnic rituals, rather than merely religious faith. Malise Ruthven (2000) discussed the terms \\"cultural Muslim\\" and \\"nominal Muslim\\" as follows:Islam: A Very Short Introduction, by Malise Ruthven, Oxford University Press, 2000. > There is, however, a secondary meaning to Muslim which may shade into the > first. A Muslim is one born to a Muslim father who takes on his or her > parents' confessional identity without necessarily subscribing to the > beliefs and practices associated with the faith, just as a Jew may describe > him- or herself as Jewish without observing the Tanakh or Halacha. In non- > Muslim societies, such Muslims may subscribe to, and be vested with, secular > identities. The Muslims of Bosnia, descendants of Slavs who converted to > Islam under Ottoman rule, are not always noted for attendance at prayer, > abstention from alcohol, seclusion of women and other social practices > associated with believing Muslims in other parts of the world. They were > officially designated as Muslims by nationality to distinguish them from > Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats under the former Yugoslav communist > regime. The label Muslim indicates their ethnicity and group allegiance, but > not necessarily their religious beliefs. In this limited context (which may > apply to other Muslim minorities in Europe and Asia), there may be no > contradiction between being Muslim and being atheist or agnostic, just as > there are Jewish atheists and Jewish agnostics. This secular definition of > Muslim (sometimes the terms cultural Muslim or nominal Muslim are used) is > very far from being uncontested. A cultural Muslim internalizes the Islamic cultural tradition, or way of thinking, as a frame of reference. Cultural Muslims are diverse in terms of norms, values, political opinions, and religious views. They retain a shared \\"discourse or structure of feeling\\" related to shared history and memories. The concept of a cultural Muslim - someone who identifies as a Muslim yet is not religious - is not always met with acceptance in conservative Islamic communities. = Believer Vs non-believer and practicing Vs. not-practicing = In non-Muslim majority countries Muslims may identify themselves by distinguishing themselves as practicing Vs. not-practicing and Believer Vs non-believer. Usually ritual practicing ones are presumed to be Believer . While non-practicing one can be believer or non-believer. Demographics When it comes to mosque attendance about 1% of the Muslims in Azerbaijan, 5% in Albania, 9% in Uzbekistan, 10% in Kazakhstan, 19% in Russia, and 22% in Kosovo attend mosque once a week or more.The World‚Äôs Muslims: Unity and Diversity According to a Pew Research Center study, only 15% of the Muslims in Albania and 18% of the Muslims in Kazakhstan said that religion was very important in their lives. The same study found that only 2% of Muslims in Kazakhstan, 4% in Albania, 10% in Kosovo, 14% in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 14% in Kyrgyzstan, 16% in Uzbekistan, and 21% in Azerbaijan perform all five prayers a day. However, these numbers may be underestimated, due to most Muslims praying regularly at home. = Belgium = Surveys conducted 1994 and 1996 observed a decrease in religiosity based on lowering mosque participation, less frequent prayer, dropping importance attached to a religious education, etc. This decrease in religiosity was more visible in younger Muslims; however, other more recent studies show that while participation in religious activities among young Muslims is reducing, they are more likely to identify with Islam culturally. A 2005 Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles study estimated that about 10% of the Muslim population in Belgium are \\"practicing Muslims\\" A 2009 survey found that the majority of Muslims in Belgium supported \\"separation between religion and state.\\" A 2010 study found that while Muslims put great emphasis on religious freedom and the overwhelming majority stated people should be free to leave Islam if they wanted, they were less comfortable with the idea of Muslims marrying non- Muslims. = Bulgaria = Evgenia Ivanova of the New Bulgarian University stated in 2011 that \\"religion is not of primary importance to Bulgaria's Muslims.\\" The New Bulgarian University conducted a survey of 850 Muslims in Bulgaria, which found that 48.6% described themselves as religious, 28.5% of which were very religious. Approximately 41% never went to a mosque and 59.3% did not pray at home. About 0.5% believed that disputes should be resolved using Islamic Sharia law and 79.6% said that wearing a veil in school was \\"unacceptable.\\" More than half of the respondents said cohabitation without marriage was \\"acceptable\\", 39.8% ate pork and 43.3% drank alcohol. On the contrary, 88% of respondents said they circumcised their boys and 96% observed Muslim burial practices for their relatives. According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, 33% of Bulgarian Muslims responded that religion is \\"very important\\" in their lives. The same survey found that 7% of Bulgarian Muslims pray all five salah, 22% attend mosque at least once a week, and 6% read Quran at least once a week. = France = According to study only 33% of French Muslims who were interviewed said they were practicing believers. That figure is the same as that obtained by the INED/INSEE study in October 2010.Michael Cosgrove, How does France count its Muslim population? , Le Figaro, April 2011. And 20% claimed to go regularly to the mosque for the Friday service,L'Islam en France et les r√©actions aux attentats du 11 septembre 2001, R√©sultats d√©taill√©s, Ifop, HV/LDV No.1-33-1, 28 September 2001 and 31% practice prayer (salat),French Muslims becoming more observant and 70% said they \\"observe Ramadan\\".French Muslims becoming more observant According to expert Franck Fregosi: \\"Although fasting during Ramadan is the most popular practice, it ranks more as a sign of Muslim identity than piety, and it is more a sign of belonging to a culture and a community\\",French Muslims becoming more observant and he added that not drinking alcohol \\"seems to be more a cultural behavior\\".French Muslims becoming more observant = Netherlands = By 2009, only 24% of Muslims in the Netherlands attended mosque once a week. A 2004 study found that the importance of Islam in the lives of Dutch Muslims, particularly of second-generation immigrants was decreasing. This observation was based on the reducing participation of younger Muslims in Islamic rituals, organizations, and prayer. The study also predicted that the trend would continue with increasing education and \\"individualization\\". However, the study also found that second-generation immigrants attached more importance to religion that the first generation as an \\"individual experience.\\" The study concluded \\"the expression of religiosity by Muslim youth was not much different to that of their Dutch Christian or Jewish peers\\". = Turkey = In a poll conducted by Sabancƒ± University in 2006 16% of Turkish Muslims said they were \\"extremely religious\\", 39% said they were \\"somewhat religious\\", and 32% said they were \\"not religious\\".  Criticism  Kia Abdullah says the term and 'cultural Muslims' identity is not only are at receiving end from conservative Muslims but also from some progressive ones saying cultural Muslim cherry pick best of both worlds without enough proactive contribution and commitment to liberalism.

Barrouallie was established by French settlers in 1719, the first European colony on St. Vincent. Once it was the capital of St.Vincent and the Grenadines. With the rest of the island, it passed back and forth between the French and the British, finally remaining in the hands of the latter. Within Saint Patrick Parish Barrouallie is both the largest city and the parish capital. The area is known for fishing and is famous for \\"blackfish\\". Due to the surrounding mountains, the town is shaped into a hole that over time has protected the town from volcanic eruptions. History Barrouallie, tent camp for people displaced by the 1902 eruption of the Soufri√®re The Native American Caribs who lived in what would become Barrouallie left a petroglyph which would become a well-known a local landmark. The figure depicted has a stylized head surrounded by a halo of thirteen rays. While the English were the first to lay claim to St. Vincent island in 1627, the French centered on the island of Martinique would be the first European settlers on the island when they established their first colony at Barrouallie on the Leeward side of St. Vincent in 1719. The French settlers cultivated coffee, tobacco, indigo, corn, and sugar on plantations worked by African slaves. In the time of slavery, Barrouallie was the center of a sugar cane-growing area on the leeward coast of Saint Vincent, with a number of flourishing estates on the nearby volcanic slopes. It was renowned for its beautiful little Anglican Church with a distinguished bell tower and black and white marble tiles (brought as ballast on the sugar ships) on the floor of its interior. The Emancipation of Slaves in the British Empire, resolved on by the British Parliament in 1833 and actually implemented in St. Vincent and other Caribbean islands by 1838, proved a mixed blessing - releasing people from bondage but also causing an economic crisis in a society hitherto based on slave labor. This was exacerbated by the rise of beet sugar cultivation in Europe. The local people's situation was precarious, and many of them emigrated to other islands in an effort to escape the poverty. Among these were Caroline Arindell, who was born in Barrouallie about 1850, and her husband John McShine - both of whom emigrated in the 1860s to Trinidad, where their descendants were to become well-known.Anthony De Verteuil, \\"The McShines of Trinidad\\", The Litho Press, Trinidad, 2006 On September 11, 1898, six hours of a terrible hurricane devastated St. Vincent in general and Barrouallie in particular. The Church and almost all houses were destroyed. A photo of Barrouallie taken in the direct aftermath shows only two or three houses still with their roofs. It took considerable time for Barrouallie to recover from this blow, and the destruction of the Church's records was an irreversible blow to knowledge of local history.

There is a post office, a police station and a library. There are also two quarries. History Layou is located on the western coast of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and was one of the first areas of settlement by the French, who were the first Europeans to settle in St. Vincent and The Grenadines in the early part of the eighteenth century. Even before then the Caribs used it as one of their settlements, as it is evident from the petroglyphs which are found in the area. In 1763, St. Vincent was taken over by the British and the lands in Layou were bought by them to cultivate sugar. Layou was still a small area formed around Jackson Bay. The cultivation of sugar cane started growing and larger estates were needed, so that the smaller holdings of the French were consolidated into larger estates. There were 3 main estates: Ruthland Vale estate, Akers estate and Palmiste Park estate. During slavery, most people lived on the estates but began to leave after slavery was abolished and to establish villages. Immediately after Emancipation, the lands of one of the estates, Akers, were sold to form Cowdrey's Village. In 1861, Layou had a population of 140 people, Cowdrey's Village 227, while 333 people lived on the Ruthland Vale estate, 15 on what remained of the Akers estate and just five at the Palmiste Park estate. The Ruthland Vale estate was sold after the eruption of the La Soufriere volcano in 1902. were set aside for refugees from areas affected by the eruption. Other changes began to take place in the area. The owner of what remained of the Ruthland Vale estates began to sell land to residents of Layou, and also residents of the estates began to move into Layou because employment possibilities on the estates were decreasing. Added to this, estate residents wanted to take advantage of social amenities, the school, clinic, church and cricket pitch among others. This led to an increase in population of Layou and also an enlargement of the town, since many of the smaller villages and estates settlements eventually became incorporated into the town of Layou. Layou is located in the Constituency of Central Leeward. Geography Layou is located on the western coast of the island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Located after the small fishing village of Buccament and before the town of Barrouallie on the Central leeward highway. Climate Layou has a seasonal tropical climate with a wet season lasting from May to November and a dry season lasting from January to May. Urban structure Layou is divided into various sections: East: * Cowdrey's Village * Akers Downtown: * Bottom Garden * Plan * Bethrome Uptown * Swamp Gut * Texier Road * Ruthland Vale West * Bambereux Education Layou serves as an important educational centre for the people of Layou, Buccament and surrounding areas. The Layou Government School is located downtown in the Plan district of Layou. The Louis Straker Resource Centre is also an educational facility for evening classes and learning and literacy programs. The waterfront project For years the beautiful Leeward town of Layou has been threatened by the ocean. Years of wave action had seriously eroded the coastline threatening the main highway and access to the communities further north. In the late 1990s three storms wreaked havoc on the Layou waterfront and the problem became so critical that Government decided to move quickly to correct the situation. A parliamentary representative for the area visited the site in July 2002 and promised to transform the area. Four years later in 2006, the waterfront project was considered completed. Today, it is a beautiful site in the town of Layou. Various activities are held at the Layou waterfront, such as the Nine Morning celebrations, which was Introduced in 2007. Culture and entertainment =Petroglyphs= The Petroglyphs in Layou are located a short distance inland from the Leeward Highway in Layou. They are more visible if you outline them with a chalk, or get a local child to do it for you. They were made by the Caribs, when they settled there before the eighteenth century. =Christmas lighting= Christmas lights on the waterfront Layou has its annual Christmas lighting where the waterfront becomes filled with Christmas lights and decorations to welcome the festive season.

As military aviation transformed methods of warfare during the First World War, spruce lumber to build combat, reconnaissance, and training airplanes was in high demand. The Pacific Northwest was home to one of the world's best supplies of spruce, and so the U.S. Military created the Spruce Production Division, headquartered at Vancouver Barracks, to ensure that the allies would have enough spruce to produce aircraft. At its peak, the Spruce Mill, once located on the plain where Fort Vancouver and Pearson Air Museum are located today, operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and produced 1 million board feet of lumber daily. The exhibit takes visitors from the entry of the United States into the war in 1917, through the creation of the Spruce Production Division and the home-front efforts undertaken in Vancouver, up to the end of the war and the birth of the Army Air Service.Vogt, Tom. Pearson Air Museum exhibit pays tribute to 'Straight-Grained Soldiers'. May 23, 2013. The Columbian Change in management The Pearson Air Museum has always been owned by the National Park Service, but was formerly managed under an agreement with the City of Vancouver, with a sub-agreement with the non- profit Fort Vancouver National Site Trust. On January 1, 2013, the City of Vancouver terminated their agreement with the National Park Service to continue operating the museum. On February 5, 2013, without a direct agreement with the Fort Vancouver National Site Trust, the National Park Service notified the Fort Vancouver National Site Trust that they could no longer manage the museum. In response the Trust removed all privately owned artifacts from the museum (except for two aircraft that were suspended from the ceiling). The National Park Service then began to directly staff the museum.

He is best known for his epic series The Chronicles of an Age of Darkness. Biography Hugh Walter Gilbert Cook was born in Essex, England in 1956. After spending his early childhood in England he moved to Ocean Island (now Banaba Island in Kiribati). His experiences of English castles and of life on an equatorial island later influenced his writing. He moved to, and was educated in New Zealand. His first novel, Plague Summer was published when he was 24 in 1980. Between 1986 and 1992 he wrote the ten-novel series The Chronicles of an Age of Darkness. Disappointing sales prevented the publication of further volumes (up to 60 were planned). In 1997 he moved to Japan, and lived in Yokohama with his wife and daughter and taught English. He subsequently published mainly online, through his site, Zen Virus. His online works include poetry, short stories, \\"flash fiction\\", and several novels. In 2005 he underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer in the form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He wrote a medical memoir, Cancer Patient, telling of this experience.

Design details The rifle is manufactured at the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (owned by FN de Herstal) to FN specifications using Winchester Model 70 actions. All current models of the SPR come in one of a variety of McMillan synthetic stocks. The earliest rifles were shipped in the H-S Precision aluminum chassis fiberglass version of the Winchester Marksman stock. While these \\"First Generation\\" rifles were simply dropped into the aluminum bedding blocks of the H-S Precision stock, the later guns are all glass bedded by hand. FN Special Police Rifles of all iterations are noted for being both very accurate (0.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome-lined bore in the barrel. A chrome-lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier-to-clean barrel for the end user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt-action sniper rifles. The barrels of the \\"First Generation\\" rifles were said to be made from the hammer-forged blanks used for M240 General Purpose Machine Gun production at the FN Manufacturing Inc. plant in Columbia, South Carolina. Later barrels are said to be from hammer-forged blanks intended exclusively for FN Special Police Rifle production.

It is within the district of Dacorum comprising mainly 19th century housing and meadowland with transport links from London to the Midlands. At the 2011 Census the population of Boxmoor was included in the Dacorum ward of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield. History Blackbird Moor, Boxmoor managed by the Box Moor Trust The name Boxmoor derives from the box tree, a bushy inhabitant of the chalky hills that surround the location. This is linked together with the word 'mor', which signifies a marshy spot; Boxmoor's ancient watermeadows are still a major feature of the locality.Hertfordshire Federation of Women's Institutes; Ann Roxburgh (Forward) (1986). The Hertfordshire Village Book. Countryside Books. Section on Redbourn . A mesolithic camp site was discovered in 1975 on the site of what is now Boxmoor trout fishery, close to Fisheries wharf. Finds include 'pot boiler' stones, bones of the wild ox, Bos Primigenius and a hand-crafted grinding quern made of the hard local rock known as Hertfordshire puddingstone. All were dated to around 1500 BCE.Hands & Davis (1989), page 14 An even older stone axe head dated to 6000 BCE was also discovered. The remains of a Roman villa have been found in the grounds of Boxmoor House School, near the railway station, dating from around the 1st or early 2nd century AD. The Box Moor Trust owns meadow land in the area alongside the River Bulbourne. This was land purchased by tenants in secret during the 16th century to prevent it being enclosed, which would have deprived them of grazing. It is still held by the same trust established at that time. Today, it is used for summer grazing and has open access for recreational use. The ancient Box Lane runs uphill from Boxmoor to Bovingdon. On this lane, close to the Boxmoor end, stood the historic early 17th century Box Lane Chapel. See the section below on places of worship. The Sparrows Herne turnpike, set up in 1762, was the stagecoach route from London to Aylesbury and passed along the valley bottom through Boxmoor following the present day London Road (A4251). The Grand Junction Canal, latterly known as the Grand Union, and the trunk canal from London to the Midlands followed along the same route in 1804. A local public house, the Fishery Inn, was an historic refreshment stop on the canal. Boxmoor village itself was developed after 1837 when the London and Birmingham Railway was forced, by local landed interests, to build its main line and station about a mile to the west of Hemel Hempstead town. The railway station, originally called Boxmoor, offered fast commuting to London combined with a small country town life, attractive to wealthier commuters and this stimulated the development of Victorian era housing near the railway station but outside the original bounds of Hemel Hempstead. In 1846, it became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;). In 1877 a branch line ‚Äì known as the \\"Nicky Line\\" ‚Äì was opened by the Midland Railway running from the London and North Western Railway's Boxmoor railway station, through Hemel Hempstead to Harpenden. However, disputes between the railway companies prevented this from ever being used for a passenger connecting service and the railway station's link to Hemel town was always via horse, bus or on foot across the Boxmoor meadows. Hemel Hempstead railway station was from 1912 known as \\"Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead\\". The area was absorbed into the expanded Hemel Hempstead new town during the 1950s and 1960s but retains a local character. The railway station was then renamed from Boxmoor to Hemel Hempstead. A four-lane dual carriageway, the A41 trunk road, was built through the district in the 1990s, connecting the M25 to Aylesbury. This crosses Boxmoor meadows in a strip of land in which all the earlier links run side by side: turnpike, canal, railway and modern trunk road. Boxmoor Hall was built by the local trust in 1889 from surplus funds. It has been used as a magistrates' court, and more recently as an arts centre run by Dacorum Borough Council. In 2007 the hall became privately owned. It is now used for performing arts, and is a licensed premises hosting special occasions.Bowmoor Hall Economy The area has little industry and limited commerce but its mostly Victorian family houses are in demand for those who work elsewhere in Hemel Hempstead and especially commuters who use the railway station to reach London in around 30 minutes. Religious sites Boxmoor Cricket Club and St. John's Church Box Lane Chapel, a Non-conformist chapel founded in 1668 on land owned by the Westbrook Hay estate, was re-built in 1690 and then altered in 1856 and again in 1876. Tradition has it that Oliver Cromwell once worshiped here at an earlier building on the site. It is now a private house after being sold in 1969. There was a Primitive Methodist chapel at Crouchfield built in 1849, which was in the St Albans Circuit. This stood until the congregation moved to Bourne Chapel in Chaulden in 1959, which is now called Hemel Hempstead Methodist Church. St John's Church was built, in 1874, on part of the Box Moor Trust land. Sports And Entertainment =Boxmoor Cricket Club= Boxmoor Cricket Club was founded in 1857 when the Box Moor Trust let some of their land be used as a cricket pitch that is known as the Boxmoor oval which had a pavilion added in the 1930s. =Hemel Hempstead Theatre Company= Originally known as The Hemel Hempstead Operatic and Dramatic Society, the Hemel Hempstead Theatre Company has operated since 1925. Over the years the company performed in a number of locations, including the Luxor Cinemas in the Marlowes and St. John‚Äôs Hall at 72 St. John's Road, which had been built in 1930 as extension of the nearby St. John‚Äôs Church. The first-ever theatrical performance at St. John‚Äôs Hall was given by the Theatre Company in April 1932. Hemel Hempstead Theatre Company purchased the St. John's Hall building in 1997 and renamed it the Boxmoor Playhouse. Holding up to 200 seats, The Boxmoor Playhouse is said to be the largest theatre in Hemel Hempstead. Each year the Company produces a variety of productions from plays to musicals to pantomimes. Due to the flexibility of the space, the Company also holds social events such as quiz nights, creative workshops and cabaret evenings. Notable residents and people Robert Snooks became, in 1802, the last highwayman to be hanged and buried at the scene of his crime, after he robbed a postboy on the turnpike on Boxmoor meadows. His remains are interred in Boxmoor meadows near the place where he was hanged and the likely spot is marked by two stones, erected by the Box Moor Trust in 1904. Rock musician and producer Steven Wilson spent his childhood in Boxmoor, and for many years maintained his No Man's Land studio in his former bedroom in his parents‚Äô bungalow. British/Canadian actor Michael Bradshaw grew up in Boxmoor from 1938 until the mid-1950s.  Further reading  .

The abbey and the preparatory school it operates, Subiaco Academy, are major features of the town of Subiaco, Arkansas. It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Little Rock and is named after the original Subiaco Abbey in Italy, the first monastery founded by Saint Benedict. History In 1877, the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad (LR&FS;) owned thousands of open acres that it wished to settle. Deciding to offer land only to German Catholics, the company approached the Abbot of St. Meinrad Archabbey in Indiana, Martin Marty, O.S.B., with an offer for the establishment of a monastery and school to serve the German population it was bringing into the region. The abbot negotiated with an agent of the railroad of a grant of for the establishment of a Benedictine monastery for monks and an additional for the foundation of a monastery for Benedictine nuns. This agreement received the support of Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, Bishop of Little Rock, who was in need of German-speaking priests for his diocese. The original foundation was made on March 15, 1878, upon the arrival of three monk-missionaries from St. Meinrad Archabbey, Father Wolfgang Schlumpf, O.S.B., Brother Kaspar Hildesheim, O.S.B., and Brother Hilarin Benetz, O.S.B.. The foundation was named St. Benedict's Priory. Due to financial and personnel difficulties, St. Meinrad requested assistance. In the fall of 1887, its own founding monastery, Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland, responding to appeals from the foundation in Arkansas, sent Fr. Gaul D'Aujourd'hui with eight candidates for the monastery, who became known in the tradition as the Eight Beatitudes. In 1886 the monastery was raised to a conventual priory, independent of St. Meinrad Archabbey, and in 1891 was named an abbey by Pope Leo XIII, receiving the name Subiaco Abbey in honor of St. Benedict's original monastery in Subiaco, Italy. The first abbot, Ignatius Conrad, O.S.B., a monk of Einsiedeln who was serving in Missouri, was elected in March 1892. Under his leadership, construction of a new abbey, made from local sandstone, was begun in 1898. In December 1901, just as the construction was nearing completion, the original wooden abbey, located about a mile away, burned to the ground and the monks transferred to the current site. This building was gutted by fire in 1927 and rebuilt. The third Abbot of Subiaco, Paul Nahlen, O.S.B., obtained Pope Pius XII's blessing for the construction of the present church on the campus. The church was completed in 1959. This act is depicted in one of the 182 stained-glass windows in St. Benedict Abbey Church. Over the years, the Benedictine monks at Subiaco have pursued various spiritual, agricultural, and commercial endeavors. First were missionary works, then the establishment of Subiaco Academy, a university-preparatory school. In 1927, Subiaco Abbey took its first step in establishing what would become Corpus Christi Abbey in Corpus Christi, Texas, until its closure in 2002. An overseas foundation was made in 1964 in Nigeria, but had to be closed in 1968, due to the Biafran War. A subsequent foundation, Santa Familia Priory, was made in Belize in 1971 and closed in 2002.

(2015‚Äìpresent) Monastery Commercial Endeavors The abbey pursues the commercial cultivation of grapes and other fruits, cattle feed crops (hay), and stands of timber. The abbey maintains an electronic commerce website where products made at the abbey are sold. They include rosaries, cremation urns, candles, woodwork, soap, calligraphy, and books. Their primary products are candy (peanut brittle) and a habanero hot sauce termed \\"Monk Sauce\\". For decades, the abbey maintained a dairy operation, but that effort was abandoned in 1964 with an open auction of the dairy cattle. Beginning in 1999, the abbey decided to make another attempt and began raising a registered herd of black Angus cattle, starting with cattle donations from local ranchers. The quality of the herd is carefully controlled with a program of artificial insemination. In 2001, the cattle operation became one of the first to begin a program of ultrasound of pregnant cattle, which enabled close monitoring of the breeding program and the quick sale of bulls. The program reached a milestone in January, 2005, with the first sale of registered Angus cattle, bringing an average price of more than $5500 per animal. In 2018, the cattle operation was leased out to a local farm family, but continues on the property. In 2018, the Abbey began a craft beer brewery, CountryMonks Brewing, and sells various brews on Saturdays at their Taproom located on the Subiaco Property. Coury House Retreat Center Subiaco provides accommodation for friends of the abbey, family members of academy students, and in accordance with the Rule of St Benedict, anyone who comes in peace. Visitor accommodations are made at the Coury House Retreat Center, an hotel-like establishment on the campus that provides room and board to visitors‚Äîincluding married couples‚Äîwho wish to experience the spiritual renewal and solitude of the Subiaco Abbey and campus. Subiaco Academy Subiaco Academy is a boarding/day school of Catholic tradition for any qualified young man in grades 7 through 12. It offers college preparatory classes, with co-curricular activities including sports, arts, and music and outdoor activities including hiking, camping, fishing, swimming, boating, water skiing, and kayaking. The Academy's stated goal is to form each student in \\"faith, scholarship, character and brotherhood.\\" David Wright, Ed.D., was appointed in 2018 as the new Subiaco Academy Headmaster. He was previously Assistant Vice-President and Athletic Director of Gettysburg College. In 2019 he instituted a new ‚ÄúParallel Curriculum‚Äù within the Academy to focus on ‚Äúintegrity-based and socially responsible leadership.‚Äù =Student Body= The Academy has a diverse student body attracting American students as well as international students from China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Cura√ßao, and South Korea. In 2020, the Academy was ranked by Niche the #1 Catholic High School in Arkansas. The student body is composed of 60% borders, 30% students of color, and 9% international students.

Priests with Credible Allegations of Abuse On September 10, 2018 the Little Rock diocese released a report disclosing the names of clergy who at some time served in Arkansas and who have been credibly accused of child sexual abuse. On January 24, 2020 the Abbey of Subiaco released a report disclosing the names of three deceased monks with established allegations of abuse: Nicholas Fuhrmann, Francis Zimmerer, and Patrick Hannon. Two additional deceased monks were listed as \\"Of Note\\": Fr. Timothy Donnelly for \\"multiple incidents of inappropriate touching\\" and Fr. Bede Mitchel as a \\"credible allegation of abuse\\" by the Diocese of Fort Worth (TX) of which neither Subiaco Abbey nor a third party independent investigator could find any evidence. A criminal investigation is still pending on a former monk, Fr. Jeremy Myers, who left Subiaco Abbey to become a diocesan priest in the Diocese of Dallas (TX) in 1991.

Ebenezer Washburn, Esq., J.P., U.E. (April 8, 1756 - November 12, 1826) was a businessman and political figure in Upper Canada. He was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts in 1756 and settled on a farm in what is now Rutland, Vermont. In 1777, he joined Major-General John Burgoyne's troops. He was captured but released to visit his father, who supported the rebels, in Keene, New Hampshire. He left on the pretext of getting his sister and escaped to Quebec, where he joined Edward Jessup's Loyal Rangers. After the war, he settled on a farm in Township No. 2 (Ernestown). Later, he moved to Hallowell Bridge (Picton), where he became a merchant and forwarder of goods. He was elected to the 3rd and 4th Parliaments representing Prince Edward County. He helped introduce the District School Act of 1807 which established a school system in the province. Washburn aligned himself with the reformers in the Assembly on many issues, but found himself disagreeing with them on other issues. In 1808, he was appointed justice of the peace. He was one of the largest land-holders in the area at the time. Near the end of his life, he suffered from edema. He died at Hallowell in 1826.

The depot was redeveloped into a residential area Laguna City in the late 80s and early 90s. Tank farm at McMurdo Station, Antarctica An oil terminal (also called a tank farm, tankfarm, oil installation or oil depot) is an industrial facility for the storage of oil, petroleum and petrochemical products, and from which these products are transported to end users or other storage facilities. An oil terminal typically has a variety of above or below ground tankage; facilities for inter-tank transfer; pumping facilities; loading gantries for filling road tankers or barges; ship loading/unloading equipment at marine terminals; and pipeline connections.  Location  Oil terminals may be located close to, or be part of, oil refineries; or be located in coastal locations where marine tankers can discharge or load cargo. Some terminals are connected to pipelines from which they draw or discharge their products. Terminals can also be served by rail, barge and road tanker (sometimes known as \\"bridging\\"). Oil terminals are also located near cities from which road tankers transport products to petrol stations or other domestic, commercial or industrial users.  Facilities  In most oil terminals there is no processing or other product transformation on site. The products from a refinery which are stored in the terminal are in their final form suitable for delivery to customers. Blending of products may be undertaken, and additives may be injected into products, but there is usually no manufacturing plant on site. Modern terminals have a high degree of site automation. Marine oil terminals have jetties to provide a deep water mooring for tankers. Jetties have loading/unloading arms for transferring cargo to/from ship to shore. Facilities for vapor recovery may be provided. Some oil terminals receive crude oil production from offshore installations. Crude oil received by pipeline may have been ‚Äòspiked‚Äô with natural gas liquids (NGL), and is known as live crude. Such oil needs to be processed or stabilised to remove the lighter fractions such as ethane, propane and butane to produce a dead or stabilised crude that is suitable for storage and transport. Such oil terminals may include processing facilities to treat the oil to achieve an oil Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of 10 to 12 psi (70 to 82 kPa). The process facilities include oil heaters to warm the oil which then routed to separator vessels. In the separators the lighter fractions flash off from the oil and are further processed to separate them into their individual components. The now stabilised oil can be routed to storage and then sold or sent for further processing. The storage tanks at an oil terminal may includes fixed roof tanks, internal floating roof tanks and external floating roof tanks. Floating roof tanks are generally used for more volatile products to reduce evaporation loss. Fixed roof tanks which have a vapor space above the product and which breathes in or out as the product is removed or the tank is filled. Some tank may be fitted with internal heating coils using hot water or steam to keep the contents warm. This reduces the viscosity of the product to ease transfer and pumping. Terminals may also have ‚ÄòHorton spheres‚Äô which are used to store liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane (see left foreground of the above Kowloon oil depot).  Standards  The design, construction, operation and maintenance of an oil terminal must be in accordance with local, national, regional and international codes, standards, and legal and statutory requirements. Relevant standards include: * Safety Guidelines and Good Industry Practices for Oil Terminals, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), 2013. * Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Crude Oil and Petroleum Product Terminals, World Bank Group (April 2007). * Design, Construction, Operation, Maintenance, and Inspection of Terminal and Tank Facilities, American Petroleum Institute, API STD 2610. * Guidance for Oil Terminal Operators, International Maritime Organization (IMO) International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code (2003). * Tank Farm Guidelines for the Chemical Industry, Basle Chemical Industry (BCI, 2009). * OECD Guidance Concerning Chemical Safety in Port Areas (OCDE/GD(96)39), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1996). * Design Code for Aboveground Atmospheric Storage Tanks, American Petroleum Institute, API 650. * Overfill Protection for Storage Tanks in Petroleum Facilities, American Petroleum Institute, API Recommended Practice 2350, 4th edition. * Prevention Of Tank Bottom Leakage - A Guide For The Design And Repair Of Foundations And Bottoms Of Vertical, Cylindrical, Steel Storage Tanks, EEMUA 183:2011, Engineering Equipment and Materials Users' Association (EEMUA, 2011). * Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction, American Petroleum Institute, API standard 653, 4th edition, April 2009. * Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector, International Society of Automation (September 2004). * Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA, February 1992). * Safety Guidelines and Good Practices for Pipelines, ECE/CP.TEIA/2006/11, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (December 2008).  Health, safety and environment  Buncefield Oil Depot, UK December 2005 Maintaining Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) requires operators of a depot to ensure that products are safely stored and handled. There must be no leakages (etc.) which could damage the soil or the water table. Fire protection is a primary consideration, especially for the more flammable products such as petrol (gasoline) and Jet A1 aviation fuel. = Incidents = The Buncefield incident occurred in December 2005. A petrol tank overflowed and spilt petrol down the outside of the tank which created a flammable fuel air mixture. This exploded and damaged and set fire to adjoining tanks and burnt for several days destroying much of the terminal. Ownership The ownership of oil depots falls into three main categories: *Single oil company ownership. When one company owns and operates a depot on its own behalf. *Joint or consortium ownership, where two or more companies own a depot together and share its operating costs. *Independent ownership, where a depot is owned not by an oil company but by a separate business which charges oil companies (and others) a fee to store and handle products. The Royal Vopak from the Netherlands is the largest independent terminal operator with 80 terminals in 30 countries. In all cases the owners may also provide \\"hospitality\\" or \\"pick up rights\\" at the facility to other companies. =Airports= Aircraft refueller at Vancouver airport Most airports also have their own dedicated oil depots (usually called \\"fuel farms\\") where aviation fuel (Jet A or 100LL) is stored prior to being discharged into aircraft fuel tanks. Fuel is transported from the depot to the aircraft either by road tanker or via a hydrant system.

Owned by Good Karma Brands, WWGK serves as the secondary ESPN Radio affiliate for Cleveland, and alongside sister station WKNR forms a duopoly branded ESPN Cleveland The WWGK studios are located in Downtown Cleveland. The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the Fairfax section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WWGK is available online. History =WJMO (1540 AM)= The station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540 kHz with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University) In 1948, WJMO carried the football games of Western Reserve College Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met Western Michigan in Kalamazoo. On June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the 106.5 MHz facility that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959. Some of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few. =WABQ (1540 AM)= Meanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490 kHz licensed to suburban Cleveland Heights, and had an FM complement at 95.3 MHz. On January 14, 1959, WJMO bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format. Detroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent. It was best known for a Top 40/R&B; format as \\"Tiger Radio\\" in the late 1960s (Booth's WJLB in Detroit used the same \\"Tiger Radio\\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \\"The Lover\\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards. Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \\"Ring-A-Ding\\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts. Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host. Throughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset. In April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two. WABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since. =1540 KNR2= In July 2006, the station was sold by D&E; Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to Beaver Dam, Wisconsin- based Good Karma Broadcasting, LLC., headed by Craig Karmazin, for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with Painesville, Ohio station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E; Communications - on October 24, 2006. Four days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \\"ESPN Radio 1540\\" with a sports/talk format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7. WWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire ESPN Radio daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station WAUK. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on WERE in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \\"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted. On December 4, 2006, Crain's Cleveland Business reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase WKNR for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at The Galleria at Erieview. On February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK took the branding of 1540 KNR2, (a play on ESPN2) in keeping with its sister station. WWGK and WKNR are also promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland. The new schedule also made WWGK the Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by Colin Cowherd and Dan Patrick and the final hour of Mike and Mike in the Morning - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website. On August 29, 2011, WKRK-FM 92.3 switched from alternative rock to a sports talk format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland. AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming. =Doctor Radio= On April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped sports programming and switched to a health/medical talk format, airing programming from Sirius XM's Doctor Radio service, as sister station WAUK did in the Milwaukee market. This was done to provide a health-related service during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It carried over general plot ideas from the earlier British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and particularly the threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only the pilot was a direct adaptation of one of the UK version's episodes. This season introduced the main characters, and established the general plot as a documentary crew is recording the lives of the employees of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In a mockumentary format, it shows Michael Scott (Steve Carell), regional manager of the Scranton branch office, as he tries to convince the filmmakers of the documentary that he presides over a happy, well-running office. Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds methods to undermine his cube- mate, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson); receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is trying to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and the temporary employee Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is acting mostly as an observer of the insanity around him. =Season 2 (2005‚Äì06)= Season two of The Office premiered on September 20, 2005, and ended on May 11, 2006. NBC initially ordered only six episodes for the season, and in September, ordered seven more. \\"NBC Gives Bonus to The Office\\" . Zap2It (September 29, 2005). Retrieved on April 22, 2008.

The second season further developed into the plot of the fear of company downsizing, along with the introduction of new characters and developing some of the minor ones‚Äîespecially that of Dwight. As Michael starts a relationship with his boss Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin), Pam and Jim's relationship become one of the focal points of the season. Their compatibility becomes more obvious as Jim's feelings for Pam continue to grow, while she struggles with her relationship with the warehouse worker Roy Anderson (David Denman). =Season 3 (2006‚Äì07)= Season three premiered on September 21, 2006, and ended on May 17, 2007.

Helms would later be promoted to series regular. The main plot for the early episodes of the season deals with a recurring problem in seasons one and two‚Äîthe problem of company downsizing‚Äîwhile in the latter half of the season, inter-office relationships also became a major plot point. Metacritic, which assigns normalized ratings out of 100 to critics' reviews, calculated an average score of 85/100 based on five collected reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". =Season 4 (2007‚Äì08)= NBC ordered a full fourth season of The Office consisting of 30 episodes, which included five one-hour specials. However, the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike shut down production for nearly five months in the middle of the season (between the episodes \\"The Deposition\\" and \\"Dinner Party\\"). Because of the shutdown, the fourth season of The Office only consisted of 19 half-hour episodes, ten of which were paired as five hour-long episodes. The season premiered on September 27, 2007. Season four marked the departure of Karen Filippelli as a regular character, although she appeared for a few seconds in the first episode, \\"Fun Run\\"; and was featured as the regional manager of the Utica branch in the sixth episode, \\"Branch Wars\\". Relationships emerged as the main theme of the season, with Jim/Pam's and Michael/Jan's rising, as well as Dwight and Angela's declining.

However, when a new boss is hired Michael feels slighted by his controlling manner. The theme of the beginning and middle of the season was mostly personal relationships with Dwight, Angela, Andy, Jim, Pam, Michael, Jan, and Holly. However, the theme transformed into career growth, as Ryan, Pam, and Michael set up the Michael Scott Paper Company, Pam and Michael go on a lecture circuit, Charles takes Jan's and Ryan's job, and Jim has trouble getting on with Charles.

This term is normally used with a life insurance or life annuity contract. To receive the cash value, the policyholder surrenders their rights to future benefits under the policy. Cash values are usually associated with whole life insurance or endowment life insurance and other forms of permanent life insurance. The contract determines for each possible cancellation date the related cash value. If the investment of premiums is contractually made in an individual account, the cash value is the value of the investments in that account at any particular time minus a surrender charge. Such cash value credited to an individual account during the tenure of the policy keeps growing with every payment of premium. It also increments due to interest credited. The policyholder may also be able to use the cash value as collateral on a loan. The cash value will often be similar or even equal to the reserve to be held by the insurance company for the net obligations from the contract. As such, the amount is usually invested and earns investment income for the insurance company which is to some extent forwarded to policyholders of participating contracts. Since often initial premiums are not invested but covering initial costs associated with selling the contract (up front or front-end fee), the amount available may be significantly lower than the sum of premiums paid for some time, initially even zero. Later, interest credited might compensate that initial loss. The value of the investment is often subject to a surrender charge in determining the cash value. A surrender charge offsets the costs associated with selling the contract and allows these contracts to be sold with little or no up front fees. Surrender charges are imposed when a contract is cancelled within a set time frame. Any cancellation after that time frame are not subject to a surrender charge. Typically surrender charges decrease on an annual schedule until they disappear altogether. Guaranteed cash value The determination of the cash value, both the base amount and the applicable surrender charge, in the contract can be explicit by determining the value for each surrender date (guaranteed cash values), by referring to the value of specific investments or subject to the discretion of the insurance company, which is often executed to bring cash values in line with values of the investments of the insurance company. Guaranteed cash values can result in significant risks for the insurance company, if the guarantee exceeds the economic value of policyholders' rights under the contract and the value of reserves hold.

Synopsis Val√©rian and Laureline are ordered to Syrte-the-Magnificent, capital of the Empire of a Thousand Planets to investigate whether the empire is a potential threat to Galaxity, the capital of Earth in the 28th century. Exploring the markets, Val√©rian buys Laureline an old gold watch which she hangs around her neck. Attracted by a gathering, they discover that one of the Authorities, the strange masked soothsayers who, it is said are the real power on Syrte, is holding a consultation. Suddenly, in the middle of the session, the Authority notices the watch around Laureline's neck. He asks her what the watch is for. When she replies that it is to tell the time, the crowd erupts in laughter. The Authority departs suddenly leaving a bemused Val√©rian and Laureline. Returning to the spaceport, Val√©rian and Laureline's boat is attacked and they are taken prisoner. They are transported to one of the Authority's temples. An Authority appears before them and asks if they are Terrans. He knows they are from Earth because of the watch ‚Äì all Syrtiens have an innate biological ability to tell the time and would have no use for such a device. He tells them that the Authority's revenge against Earth will be dreadful. Val√©rian and Laureline give the guards the slip and exploring the temple are amazed to discover sophisticated machinery and laboratories. Finding a hangar they escape the temple in an aircraft but are pursued. The pursuit breaks off when they enter a cloud and Val√©rian and Laureline soon find out why as their aircraft is battered by an ice storm. Ditching the aircraft, they begin their journey back to Syrte on foot where they meet a group of fishermen who agree to bring them to the city on their boat. Reaching Syrte, Val√©rian and Laureline attempt to gain entry to the Imperial Palace by dressing as nobles but they are refused entry by the guards. Meeting a merchant called Elmir, he offers to get them into the palace in return for them sharing information about what they find inside with him. Elmir organises for them to hide inside a consignment of Schamil clams warning them not to allow the clam to close completely over them or they will be affected by its hallucinogenic properties. Once inside the palace, Val√©rian emerges safely from his clam but is horrified to discover Laureline's has broken into pieces. Searching for Laureline, Val√©rian enters the opulent hall where the festival is going on and is amazed to see her sharing a cupola with the emperor, Prince Ramal. The festival ends and as the crowds make their way to the exit, Val√©rian makes for the wing where the Authorities are housed. He finds the Authorities gathered in a chamber, their masks removed, drinking a strange phosphorescent liquid chanting \\"So that we may live and the Earth dies!\\". Suddenly a portcullis closes behind him and he is a prisoner. Taken to the interrogation room, the Authorities use their machines to extract information about Val√©rian's astroship and about the Earth. The next morning, the door to the interrogation room opens and Laureline leads Prince Ramal into the room ‚Äì she has heard about Val√©rian's capture and has convinced the Prince to agree to release him. The Authorities object but the Prince insists on keeping his promise. Leaving the palace, Val√©rian and Laureline head into the slums of the city to the address Elmir left them. Arriving at the house, they are amazed to discover that Elmir is, in fact, the Grand Master of the Merchant's Guild. He brings them to a secret meeting of the guild members. After Val√©rian and Laureline have told their story, Elmir and the other merchants fill them in on the Authorities rise to power ‚Äì they arrived on Syrte a hundred years ago and used their superior knowledge of medicine and psychology to make their name on Syrte. They used their ever-increasing power to suppress scientific knowledge and replace it with their religion. The resulting impact on trade has prompted the guild to act ‚Äì they have discovered that the Authorities base of operations is located on a barren asteroid called Slomp. They want Val√©rian and his astroship to lead a fleet to assault the base. Val√©rian agrees and a few days later Elmir manages to escort them safely to the spaceport and their astroship. They take off accompanied by the guild spaceships. The fleet swells its numbers by calling on further guild ships from the other planets in the empire. Approaching Slomp, Elmir reveals why he wanted Val√©rian and his astroship ‚Äì he knows Val√©rian and Laureline are aliens from Earth and also that their astroship is capable of jumping in space-time. He hopes that ability will give them the upper hand. When the Authorities attack the fleet in their spaceships, Val√©rian executes a series of spatio-temporal jumps and destroys the Authorities' ships. Arriving at Slomp, the fleet lands and the Guild troops led by Elmir head for the base. The hills on Slomp look like faces and Elmir explains that they are the remains of the indigenous inhabitants of Slomp. Flowing from their eyes like tears is the strange phosphorescent liquid Val√©rian saw the Authorities drinking in the Imperial Palace on Syrte. The Authorities' base turns out to be a crashed spaceship. Outside, slave laborers are hard at work gathering the phosphorescent tears. Surrounding the base, the troops launch a surprise attack and, aided by the slaves, easily overcome the guards. As they close in on the spaceship, a voice from a loudspeaker requests Val√©rian to enter the ship alone. Reaching the flight deck of the spaceship, he is greeted by the Authorities. They remove their helmets to reveal themselves as horribly scarred, ancient humans. They were part of a space expedition that left Earth many centuries ago. An accident during flight caused them to crash on Slomp where they used the phosphorescent liquid to extend their lives beyond the normal human span. Eventually, they captured a Syrtien spaceship and made their way to Syrte to take over. Their plan was to assemble an armada to attack Earth as revenge against the planet for making no effort to rescue them. However, the technology of Val√©rian's astroship is vastly superior to theirs ‚Äì he destroyed their entire squadron ‚Äì and they have now realised that any attempt at revenge is doomed to fail. Accordingly, they have chosen to commit suicide instead ‚Äì the spaceship is rigged to explode. Val√©rian leaves and the spaceship blows up. Elsewhere, throughout the empire, the other Authorities destroy their temples taking their own lives in the process. Returning to Syrte with the fleet and the freed slaves, Elmir is delighted ‚Äì the Empire will be back to normal again. He is surprised then when Val√©rian tells him that, with the Authorities gone, there has been an uprising on Syrte ‚Äì the fishermen and the peasants have risen up, helped by the scientists and academics who went into hiding during the Authorities' purges. Val√©rian explains that the reason as to why the Authorities took over so easily was that the empire was already in decline and that the Authorities were the only thing keeping the imperial system going. Sensing an opportunity, Elmir asks Val√©rian if he could use the spatio-temporal jump to get back to Syrte ahead of his rival merchants so that he can stake a claim in the new provisional government. Val√©rian agrees and, later, parts company with Elmir outside the Imperial Palace. Val√©rian and Laureline return to their astroship intending to ask Earth to send a trade mission to Syrte to assist them.

The city itself is a vast marketplace where merchants trade wares from all corners of the Empire. A network of canals connects the districts of the city with the spaceport and the cultivated areas outlying the city. Beyond them lie dense jungles where peasant fishermen hunt the huge Marcyam water serpents and where the mysterious Authorities have their strange temples. The Syrtien climate has no wind, so boats are driven by paddles powered by solar sails, while static electricity causes dense ice storms to spring up suddenly. When the ice melts, the pollen that is released causes beautiful flowers to bloom in the air. The perfume of the flowers forces the Marcyams out of their waterholes which allow the fishermen to hunt them.  Glam, a forest world.

Notes * This is the first Val√©rian album to move into fully fledged space opera, as opposed to the time travel theme of the previous stories. * Kim Thompson of The Comics Journal, in his introduction to Valerian: The New Future Trilogy (an English language collection of the albums On the Frontiers, The Living Weapons and The Circles of Power, ), has pointed out the similarities in the visual look of this album and George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy and states that the film's designers, some of whom were French, owned a collection of Val√©rian albums. In particular, he points to similarities between the scene where Val√©rian is interrogated by the Authorities and the scene in The Empire Strikes Back where Han Solo is encased in a substance called carbonite. * Val√©rian and Laureline's saucer-shaped astroship makes its first appearance in an album (it was first seen in the short-story The Great Collector) and we learn its designation, XB982, for the first time. The astroship appears in virtually every subsequent album. * There is a brief reference to the planet Bluxte as being one of the planets of the Empire. Bluxte is referenced again in Ambassador of the Shadows as being the homeworld of the Grumpy Converter, a creature the reappears in several subsequent albums. Bluxte appears to be a planet with a surplus of unusual (and useful) fauna ‚Äì in the case of Empire of a Thousand Planets, we are introduced briefly to the telepathic Spiglics, familiar animals that live on the head of their master, communicating their continuous happiness to him or her by thought transference. * The film adaptation of the popular series of stories would later use the name \\"Empire of a Thousand Planets\\" as the inspiration for the film's title, \\"Valerian and The City of a Thousand Planets.\\" Category:1971 graphic novels Category:Val√©rian and Laureline Category:Works set in the 28th century ","title":"Empire of a Thousand Planets"},{"id":"3385795","text":"Rotherfield Greys is a village and civil parish in the Chiltern Hills in South Oxfordshire.

Early life Edward Jessup was born in Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut Colony, British North America, British Empire, on December 24, 1735 and moved with his family, to Dutchess County, New York, in 1744. French and Indian War In 1759, during the French and Indian War, Edward Jessup served under the leadership of British general Jeffery Amherst in the Lake Champlain region. Following the war, in 1764, he moved with his brother, Ebenezer, to Albany County, New York, where they established a community, known as Jessup's Landing, on the Hudson River. Jessup was a recipient of a large land grant, from the British Crown, in the Adirondacks, around .

The company's early instruments featured guitar designs based on the Gibson Explorer (The Standard) and Gibson Flying V (Vector), before adding more traditional Gibson-inspired designs such as the Sunburst. Hamer Guitars is generally considered the first \\"boutique\\" vintage-style electric guitar brand that specifically catered to professional musicians, and was the first guitar manufacturers to produce a 12 string bass guitar. The company was incorporated in Illinois in 1976 by John Montgomery, Jol Dantzig, James Walker and Hamer. It was acquired by Kaman Music Corporation in 1988, which was purchased in turn by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in 2008. Hamer offered a wide array of electric guitars and electric basses and since its foundation, placed an emphasis on producing high-quality instruments with vintage aesthetics as well as creative innovations. Kaman marketed a lower- priced line of Asian-built instruments called the Hamer XT Series and Slammer by Hamer, which was discontinued in 2009. After a 4-year hiatus since Fender had discontinued the Hamer models in 2013, the brand was re-introduced as a subsidiary of KMC Music, which announced the return of Hamer Guitars at the NAMM Show that same year.  History  The first Hamer guitar, a Flying V bass, was built at Northern Prairie Music, a vintage instrument shop in Wilmette, Illinois, owned by Hamer and Dantzig. The shop catered to musicians who were interested in high-quality instruments. This first instrument served as the basis for a new company called Hamer Guitars. Hamer began publicizing its instruments in 1974, with small black-and-white ads in guitar magazines. Hamer Guitars Inc. was incorporated in Illinois in 1976 by John Montgomery, Jol Dantzig, Paul Hamer and James Walker. In 1977 the company set up shop in Palatine, Illinois and employed seven workers. At this time the woodworking was being subcontracted to the Tom Holmes Company in Nashville, Tennessee, with the painting and setup (stringing) being done in the Palatine shop. Prior to that point production had been one-off custom variations on the original \\"Standard\\" and \\"Flying V\\" guitars. The new arrangement with Holmes allowed Hamer to broaden its offering by building a more mainstream instrument called the \\"Sunburst.\\" Before this expansion Hamer's customers were limited to big- name touring groups such as Kiss, Bad Company, Wishbone Ash, Jethro Tull and Savoy Brown. In the late 1970s to the mid-1980s Def Leppard used Hamer guitars and basses. Cheap Trick on stage in 1977 with their Hamer instruments: Rick Nielsen (left) with a standard model and Tom Petersson with a 10-string bass To appeal to a broader market, Hamer introduced its first production guitar, the Sunburst, 1977. Production was reportedly around 10 guitars per week. During that time, the company gained more popularity due to the high-profile patronage of Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen and that group's use of Hamer eight- and 12-string basses. In 1978, Frank Untermyer joined the company as part of Hamer's attempt to expand its business worldwide. Untermyer served as a partner and international sales manager. A 1980 \\"Special\\" model In 1980, Hamer moved to larger quarters in Arlington Heights, a suburb of Chicago. The staff had grown to 12 and Hamer Guitars continued to launch new models, such as the \\"Special\\", \\"Cruisebass\\", \\"Prototype\\", \\"Blitz\\" and \\"Phantom\\". Paul Hamer, the company's president,and chief salesperson, left in 1987 to pursue a career in retail. Kaman Music was then approached to handle sales, while the remaining owners concentrated on manufacturing. Kaman Music agreed to purchase Hamer in late 1988. Glenn Tipton's Hamer Phantom GT Form this era stems the appearance of Hamer models for Heavy metal pioneers Judas Priest. Glenn Tipton's designed and used two very iconic Hamer guitars: the non-production Hamer GT Custom, introduced in 1986, and the Hamer Phantom GT. Especially designed by Tipton, the GT Custom has a unique design, loosely based on a classic asymmetric V design but optimised for balance, sporting either Seymour Duncans and EMGs pickups. The Phantom GT followed the more traditional design of a super-strat double cutaway guitar, equipped with EMG pickups. Both guitars are still used by Tipton on stage as of 2020.http://www.glenntipton.com/hamer-guitar.asp After five years with Kaman, Dantzig left the company in 1993, moving to California to begin a design and consulting business. In 1997 Kaman Music relocated Hamer to a small shop in New Hartford, Connecticut, home of Ovation Guitars. Ten employees were relocated to New Hartford along with Dantzig, who was re-hired as technical director. Untermyer had the dual role of general manager of both Hamer and Ovation. Hamer then began concentrating on a core of high-quality designs targeted at the high-end and collector market. Brand Manager Frank Rindone assumed all marketing, advertising and sales responsibilities. Along with its parent company Kaman Music, Hamer was acquired by guitar giant Fender Musical Instruments on December 31, 2007. Hamer lives in Chicago, where he operates a retail framing business. Dantzig left Fender in 2010 to build instruments under the Jol Dantzig Guitar Design name. Untermyer left the company in 2012 and now oversees the global supply chain of guitar manufacturer C. F. Martin & Company. In December 2012, Fender announced that Hamer would no longer produce guitars and the company would cease to operate.\\"Fender closes Hamer. Are more to follow?\\" by Ronnie Dungan, 28 Dec 2012\\"FMIC Suspends Hamer Production\\" on Premier Guitars website, 9 Jan 2013 As of January 25, 2017 KMC Music announced at NAMM 2017 the re-introduction of import Hamer Guitars with 5 models.

He captained the mid-week Wallabies team on the 2010 Spring Tour for the matches against Leicester Tigers and Munster, where his standout performance on that tour was against Italy in Florence where he scored 22 points in that game. Barnes handled the goal-kicking in Florence, in the absence of James O‚ÄôConnor, kicking eight goals from nine attempts as he showed the benefits of his work with the Wallabies' South African kicking consultant, ex Springbok Braam van Straaten. In the final Test of the 2010 Spring Tour, Barnes, playing at inside centre, linked with fly-half Quade Cooper to help orchestrate a spectacular 59-16 demolition of France, in Paris. Barnes made five appearances at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, which included the final 28 minutes of the quarter-final against South Africa, and the last 45 minutes of the semi-final against New Zealand; in both instances coming on at inside centre in the place of Pat McCabe. He stepped into the fly-half role after Quade Cooper was injured 21 minutes into Australia's Bronze medal playoff against Wales, and steered Australia astutely to a 21‚Äì18 win.

The lighthouse has an iron screw-pile foundation with a platform, and a skeletal, octagonal, pyramidal tower, which is painted red. The light is above the water. It was the oldest functioning lighthouse of its type in the United States until it was decommissioned in 2015, having been completed in 1852. Carysfort Reef is named for , a 20-gun Royal Navy post ship that ran aground on the reef in 1770. The light currently installed is a xenon flashtube beacon. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Caesar and Florida The original Carysfort Reef light was a lightship named Caesar,Swanson:14 starting in 1825. Caesar was built in New York City. While being sailed to its station, it went aground near Key Biscayne during a storm, and its crew abandoned the ship. The ship was salvaged by wreckers and taken to Key West, Florida. The owners bought the ship back and it was placed on station at Carysfort Reef. The lightship was often blown off-station by storms, and even went aground on the reef at one point. That first lightship had to be replaced after only five years because of dry rot. The second lightship was named Florida. Lightship keeper Both lightships were captained by John Whalton, who at the age of 25 won his initial appointment as commander of the Caesar, in 1825. After the Cape Florida Lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836, the Carysfort Reef lightship became the only navigational light on the Florida coast between St. Augustine and Key West. In 1836, Seminoles attacked Capt. Whalton and four of his helpers as they went ashore on Key Largo to tend their garden at Garden Cove, Key Largo. Capt. Whalton and one helper were killed, and two of the other three were wounded, but the three managed to escape back to the ship, where the rest of the seven man crew awaited, along with Capt. Whalton's wife and daughter, who at the time were visiting from Key West.The Florida Keys: A History of the Pioneers, John Viele, p.36-40 New lighthouse Congress appropriated funds for a lighthouse at Carysfort Reef in the 1840s. It was the third screw-pile lighthouse in the United States. The interchangeable parts were manufactured in 1848 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a construction crew was trained there. The erection of the lighthouse was more difficult than expected. The site was under four-and-a-half feet of water, and the reef was not solid, as expected, but consisted of a hard shell over compacted sand. The plans had to be modified by adding large plates to the piles to spread the weight of the lighthouse over a larger area of the reef. When the supervisor of the construction died, the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers sent Lieutenant George Meade (later commander of the Army of the Potomac and victor at Gettysburg) to complete the project. This was Meade's first command of a lighthouse project. =Original structure= The original lens was a first- order Fresnel lens. The structure originally had a balcony that encircled the enclosed, circular light keeper's quarters. The balcony and its railing were later removed. Head keepers * Courtland P.

This simple RF choke impedes signals passing on the outside of the braid, which helps to cure television interference. A braid-breaker is a filter that prevents television interference (TVI). In many cases of TVI, caused by a high field strength of a nearby high frequency (HF) transmitter, the aerial down lead plugged into the back of the TV acts as a longwire antenna or as a simple vertical element. The radio frequency (RF) current flowing through the tuner of the TV tends to generate harmonics which then spoil the viewing. The braid breaker works by preventing RF signals picked up on the outside (common mode signals) flowing into the TV set, while passing RF inside the coax (non common mode) from the antenna.  Designs  Designs for diminishing unwanted signals are based on two types of filters: a ‚Äúchoke‚Äù filter which blocks signals in the electrical mode most interference uses, and filters that selectively admit or impede signals depending on the signal frequency. Further, carefully chosen combinations of filters of either one type or both types multiply each other's effects, so that even if only slightly different, two filters are more effective than a single filter, or either filter alone. =Ferrite choke= ‚ÄúChokes‚Äù work by blocking signals traveling via common mode and pass through differential-mode or ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù currents unchanged. In the common mode all signals running along all the wires travel in the same direction. When the unwanted signal is only in the common mode then the desired signal can pass through the filter via the differential-mode. ferrite \\"bead\\" choke, consisting of a cylinder of ferrite encircling a computer power cord to block electronic noise. One design is a snap-on ferrite choke, fastened over the aerial cable just before it plugs into the TV set. The UHF signal is sent in differential- mode, that has equal and opposite currents running on the interior surfaces of the conductors. Those two opposite currents lie close enough together for their magnetic fields to cancel each other, and so those signal currents don't couple magnetically with the ferrite, and pass through unaffected. However currents that are traveling in the same direction on the two conductors (common mode current) re-enforce each other's magnetic fields, which are channeled through the ferrite. The ferrite in effect enhances the magnetic fields thousands of times, by keeping it concentrated near the surface of the ferrite, rather than allowing the fields to spread out. The common mode alternating currents are then impeded by the magnetic fields they themselves created. So ‚Äúchoke‚Äù is a very good name: The ferrite in effect ‚Äúchokes off‚Äù the signal path for interference that generally travels via common mode currents, but leaves unaffected the desired signals which are typically arranged to flow via differential mode current. =High-pass filter= On the left is a normal TV installation which is being troubled by TVI while on the right is a TV installation which has features to eliminate/mitigate the TVI The other type of filters used are based on frequency: Below their operating frequency limit, inductors (coils) impede signals at higher frequencies more, and admit low frequencies, whereas capacitors do the opposite: capacitors admit high frequencies but impede low frequencies. These can be played-off against each other to impede or admit signals based on frequency. A simple design for a high-pass filter consists of two 4.7 pF ceramic capacitors and two simple air-core inductor coils (4 turns of 20 AWG copper wire wound using a 6 mm drill bit as a form). The design is a symmetric network: The line is cut and the coils are connected from the braid to the core of the coaxial cable ends, while the capacitors bridge the cut, one capacitor connecting core-to-core and the other reconnecting the cut outer shield braids. As an extra precaution, a 1.5 MŒ© resistor is wired in parallel with the capacitor connecting the shields. The resistor acts as a ‚Äúslow leak‚Äù on the ground wire that prevents buildup of static electricity on the TV aerial, but is too high a resistance to pass a signal carried along the cable, which operates near 72 Œ©. The impedance of the capacitors is very large for shortwave signals, below 50 MHz, but for UHF TV signals above 450 MHz their impedance is very small. In the opposite sense, the impedance of the coils connecting the inner and outer wires at the lower frequencies is very small, while for the wanted UHF signals the coils have a very high impedance. Hence the network does the following: * At and below HF (below about 50 MHz) the coils short-circuit the core to the braid for both input and output, while the capacitors impede signals passing straight through. Hence isolating the input from the output for HF signals. * At UHF, the impedance of the coils blocks the short-circuit between the core wire and the braid for both input and output, whereas the capacitors pass through the signals almost unchanged. Hence the UHF signals are connected as normal to the respective terminals on the other side of the network. =Combination= An even better option is to use both a choke and a high-pass filter, since the filter described above may not be as effective for common- mode currents, which the choke will selectively remove.

The road was given its current name because it was considered the mountain equivalent to Victoria's world- famous Great Ocean Road in the south-west of the state. The road usually remains open during winter; however, vehicles travelling between Harrietville and Omeo are required to carry diamond-patternMount Hotham, Wheel Chains snow chains during the declared snow season.Travel Victoria, Great Alpine Road History In 1923 the Victorian Country Roads Board (CRB) took responsibility for the Alpine Road between Harrietville and Omeo, and appointed William Benjamin (Bill) Spargo (1888-1959) as supervisor. He lived in a stone cottage at Hotham Heights, which the CRB expanded, at his request, to accommodate up to twenty visiting skiers. From 1925 the premises operated as a guest-house, Hotham Cottage (Hotham Heights Chalet). This was the forerunner of the Hotham Alpine Resort. Route details The Great Alpine Road winds through mountains, valleys and forests, and past rivers, vineyards and farms. At a length of , it is Australia's highest year-round accessible sealed road. The section over Mount Hotham rises to an altitude of AMSL. It is blanketed with snow during winter months and must be cleared on a daily basis. Extreme weather conditions can sometimes still result in the road being closed between Harrietville and Omeo. The Great Alpine Road links Victoria's North East with Gippsland. It was completed with the sealing of the section between Mount Hotham and Dinner Plain and was officially opened on 4 April 1998. The road itself has existed since colonial times in some form, but was unsealed for much of its history, and was only given the Great Alpine Road designation after being fully sealed. The current Great Alpine Road includes the former Ovens Highway from Wangaratta to Bright, and a former section of the Omeo Highway from Omeo to Bruthen, along with the section of the Omeo Highway from Bruthen to Bairnsdale.

Many natural and man-made phenomena can disrupt the reception of television signals. These include naturally occurring and artificial spark discharges, and effects due to the operation of radio transmitters. Analog television broadcasts display different effects due to different kinds of interference. Digital television reception generally gives a good quality picture until the interference is so large that it can no longer be eliminated by the error checking systems in the receiver, at which point the video display becomes pixelated, distorts, or goes blank. Co-channel and multipath (ghost) During unusual atmospheric conditions, a distant station normally undectable at a particular location may provide a much stronger signal than usual. The analog television picture may display the sum of the two signals, producing an image from the strong local signal with traces or \\"ghosts\\" from the distant, weaker signal. Television broadcast stations are located and assigned to channels so that such events are rare. Readjustment of the receiving antenna may allow more of the distant signal to be rejected, improving image quality. A local signal may travel by more than one path from the transmitter to receiving antenna. \\"Multipath\\" reception is visible as multiple impressions of the same image, slightly shifted along the width of the screen due to the varying transmission path. Some multipath reception is momentary due to road vehicles or aircraft passing; other multipath problems may persist due to reflection off tall buildings or other landscape features. Strong multipath can cause the analog picture to \\"tear\\" or momentarily lose synchronization, causing it to roll or flip.Joma Hyppia, 8 Ways to Beat TV Interference, Popular Mechanics, June 1980 pages 88-89 Static electricity and sparks The sparks generated by static electricity can generate interference. Many systems where radio frequency interface is caused by sparking can be modeled as the following circuit. The source of energy charges C1 via a resistance, and when the spark gap breaks down, the electricity passes through L and excites the resonant LC circuit. The energy in the LC circuit is then radiated through the aerial. Diagram of a spark transmitter As an example, when a person walks over a nylon carpet, the rubbing of shoes on carpet performs the role of a battery and resistor, while the person acts as a capacitor (C1 and C2), and the air between a hand and a door knob is a spark gap. Stray inductance acts as L. Sparks and allied phenomena Horizontal lines randomly arranged on a television screen may be caused by sparking in a malfunctioning electrical device. Electric railways can also be a strong source of this type of interference. Other possible sources of such interference include thermostats, fridges, freezers, fish tank heaters, central heating systems. These can create sparks as they turn on or off; as they age they can become worse. In some rare cases they can create non-stop interference through sparking. Electric motors that have a commutator can suffer from sparking at the brushes. Ignition systems on cars and motorbikes. Devices which switch at powerline frequency  Power line hardware can generate sparks at either a 100 or 120 Hz rate Light dimmers and other solid state power control devices can generate interference. Thyristor and TRIAC regulators without proper chokes are a common source of EMI as well. It is likely that a thyristor (SCR) power controller using the variable phase angle method will generate harmonics of the mains supply, while the spark at a contact will be a very wide band source whose frequency is not related to the power supply frequency. In Thyristor control systems the potential for EMI problems can be minimised by using zero crossing switching where the thyristor is switched on at the moment of time when the AC voltage changes from one direction to the other. A typical SCR based light dimmer which dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is wired in series with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) for a bridge which generates DC with much ripple. R and C form a circuit with a time constant, as the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C will charge up, when C is able to make ZD conduct and inject current into the SCR the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops at the end of the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. Devices which switch faster than 200 Hz  * Computers and other digital electronic equipment. These devices create and use signals which are switched on/off at great speed. It is the case that any repetitive signal can be reduced down to a Fourier series of sine waves. It so happens that a perfect square wave is :E = Eo sin (œât) - {Eo sin (2œât)}/2 + {Eo sin (3œât)}/3 ...... As the term goes on for ever to higher and higher frequencies the square wave contains harmonics of the fundamental which go on upwards in frequency for ever, these harmonics are responsible for much of the interference created by computers. A modern PC is a device which is operating in the VHF/UHF frequency range using square waves. As the cases on many computers are not perfect shields, some of this radio frequency energy can leak out and cause interference to radio (and sometimes TV) reception. Switched-mode power supplies or packs can be a source of interference. These are used in consumer electronic/electrical products and in some lighting systems. Strong TV signals It is possible to also get a bad picture if the signal strength of the TV transmitter is too high. An attenuator inserted in the antenna lead-in wire may be used if the television receiver displays signs of overload in the RF front end. Strong out-of-band signals may also affect television reception and may require band-pass filters to reduce the level of the undesired signal at the receiver.

On infection, the Jerusalem virus becomes memory resident (using 2kb of memory), and then infects every executable file run, except for COMMAND.COM. COM files grow by 1,813 bytes when infected by Jerusalem and are not re-infected. Executable files grow by 1,808 to 1,823 bytes each time they are infected, and are then re-infected each time the files are loaded until they are too large to load into memory. Some .EXE files are infected but do not grow because several overlays follow the genuine .EXE file in the same file. Sometimes .EXE files are incorrectly infected, causing the program to fail to run as soon as it is executed. The virus code itself hooks into interrupt processing and other low level DOS services. For example, code in the virus suppresses the printing of console messages if, for example, the virus is not able to infect a file on a read-only device such as a floppy disk. One of the clues that a computer is infected is the mis-capitalization of the well-known message \\"Bad command or file name\\" as \\"Bad Command or file name\\". The Jerusalem virus is unique among other viruses of the time, as it is a logic bomb, set to go off on Friday the 13th on all years but 1987. Once triggered, the virus not only deletes any program run that day, but also infects .EXE files repeatedly until they grow too large for the computer. This particular feature, which was not included in all of Jerusalem's variants, is triggered 30 minutes after the system is infected, significantly slows down the infected computer, thus allowing for easier detection. Jerusalem is also known as \\"BlackBox\\" because of a black box it displays during the payload sequence. If the system is in text mode, Jerusalem creates a small black rectangle from row 5, column 5 to row 16, column 16. Thirty minutes after the virus is activated, this rectangle scrolls up two lines. As a result of the virus hooking into the low-level timer interrupt, PC-XT systems slow down to one fifth of their normal speeds 30 minutes after the virus has installed itself, though the slowdown is less noticeable on faster machines. The virus contains code that enters a processing loop each time the processor's timer tick is activated. Symptoms also include spontaneous disconnection of workstations from networks and creation of large printer spooling files. Disconnections occur since Jerusalem uses the 'interrupt 21h' low-level DOS functions that Novell NetWare and other networking implementations required to hook into the file system. Jerusalem was initially very common (for a virus of the day) and spawned a large number of variants. However, since the advent of Windows, these DOS interrupts are no longer used, so Jerusalem and its variants have become obsolete.  Aliases  * 1808(EXE), due to the virus's length of 1808 bytes. * 1813(COM), due to the virus's length of 1813 bytes. * Friday13th (Note: The name can also refer to two viruses that are unrelated to Jerusalem: Friday-13th-440/Omega and Virus-B), due to its trigger date of Friday the 13th. * Hebrew University, as it was discovered by students who attended Hebrew University. * Israeli * PLO, due to a belief that it was created by the Palestine Liberation Organization to mark May 13, 1948, the day before Israel Independence Day, the last day Palestine existed as a country. * Russian * Saturday 14 *sUMsDos, referencing a piece of the virus's code. Variants * Get Password 1 (GP1): Discovered in 1991, this Novell NetWare- specific virus attempts to gather passwords from the NetWare DOS shell in memory upon user login, which it then broadcasts to a specific socket number on the network where a companion program can recover them. This virus does not work on Novell 2.x and newer versions. * Suriv Viruses: Viruses that are earlier, more primitive versions of Jerusalem. The Jerusalem virus is considered to be based on Suriv-3, which is a logic bomb triggered when the date is Friday the 13th, switching off the computer on the 13th. In itself, Suriv-3 is based on its predecessors, Suriv-1 and Suriv-2, which are logic bombs triggered on April 1 (April Fools' Day), showing text reading \\"April 1, ha ha you have a virus!\\". Suriv-1 infects .COM files and Suriv-2 infects .EXE files, while Suriv-3 infects both types of files. The name of these viruses comes from spelling \\"virus\\" backwards. * Sunday (Jeru-Sunday): (Main article: Sunday (computer virus))This virus grows files by 1,636 bytes. The variant is intended to delete every program as it is run every Sunday, but software bugs prevent this from happening. On each Sunday, the virus displays the following message: > Today is SunDay! Why do you work so hard? All work and no play make you a > dull boy! Come on! Let's go out and have some fun! * Variants of Sunday  Sunday.a: The original Sunday virus.  Sunday.b: A version of Sunday which has a functional program-deleting function.

Sunday.1.Tenseconds: A variant on Sunday.a which maintains a 10 second delay between messages and sets Sunday as day 0 instead of day 7.  Sunday.2: A variant on Sunday.a which grows files by 1,733 bytes instead of the original 1,636 bytes. * Anarkia: Anarkia has a trigger date of Tuesday the 13th and uses the self-recognition code \\"Anarkia\\". * PSQR (1720): PQSR infects .COM and .EXE files, but does not infect overlay files or COMMAND.COM. It causes infected .COM files to grow by 1,720 bytes and .EXE files by 1,719-1,733 bytes. It activates on Friday the 13th, and will delete any file run that day. Garbage is written to the master boot record and the nine sectors after the MBR. The virus uses \\"PQSR\\" as its self-recognition code. * Fr√®re: Fr√®re plays Fr√®re Jacques on Fridays. It increases the size of infected .COM files by 1,813 bytes and .EXE files by 1,808-1,822 bytes, but does not infect COMMAND.COM. * Westwood (Jerusalem-Westwood): Westwood causes files to grow by 1,829 bytes. If the virus is memory-resident, Westwood deletes any file run during Friday the 13th. * Jerusalem 11-30: This virus infects .COM, .EXE, and overlay files, but not COMMAND.COM. The virus infects programs as they are used, and causes infected .COM files to grow by 2,000 bytes and .EXE files to grow by 2,000-2,014 bytes. However, unlike the original Jerusalem virus, it does not re-infect .EXE files. * Jerusalem-Apocalypse: Developed in Italy, this virus infects programs as they are executed, and will insert the text \\"Apocalypse!!\\" in infected files. It causes infected .COM files to grow by 1,813 bytes and .EXE to grow by 1,808-1,822 bytes. It can re-infect .EXE files, and will increase the size of already infected .EXE files by 1,808 bytes. * Jerusalem-VT1: If the virus is memory-resident, it will delete any file run on Tuesday the 1st. * Jerusalem-T13: The virus causes .COM and .EXE files to grow by 1,812 bytes. If the virus is memory-resident, it will delete any program run on Tuesday the 13th. * Jerusalem-Sat13: If the virus is memory-resident, it will delete any program run on Saturday the 13th. * Jerusalem-Czech: The virus infects .COM and .EXE files, but not COMMAND.COM. It causes infected .COM files to grow by 1,735 bytes and .EXE files to grow by 1,735-1,749 bytes. It will not delete programs run on Friday the 13th. Jerusalem-Czech has a self-recognition code and a code placement that differ from the original Jerusalem, and is frequently detected as a Sunday variant. * Jerusalem-Nemesis: This virus inserts the strings \\"NEMESIS.COM\\" and \\"NOKEY\\" in infected files. * Jerusalem-Captain Trips: Jerusalem-Captain Trips contains the strings \\"Captain Trips\\" and \\"SPITFIRE\\". Captain Trips is the name of the apocalyptic plague described in Stephen King's novel The Stand. If the year is any year other than 1990 and the day is a Friday on or after the 15th, Jerusalem-Captain Trips creates an empty file with the same name as any program run that day. On the 16th Jerusalem-Captain Trip re-programs the video controller, and on several other dates it installs a routine in the timer tick that activates when 15 minutes pass. Jerusalem-Captain Trips has several errors. * Jerusalem-J: The variant causes .COM files to grow by 1,237 bytes and .EXE files by about 1,232 bytes. The virus has no \\"Jerusalem effects\\", and originates from Hong Kong. * Jerusalem-Yellow (Growing Block): Jerusalem-Yellow infects .EXE and .COM files. Infected .COM files grow by 1,363 bytes and .EXE files grow by 1,361-1,375 bytes. Jerusalem-Yellow creates a large yellow box with a shadow in the middle of the screen and the computer hangs. * Jerusalem-Jan25: If the virus is memory-resident, it will activate on January 25 and will delete any program run that day. Additionally, it does not re-infect .EXE files. * Skism: The virus will activate on any Friday after the 15th of the month, and causes infected .COM files to grow by 1,808 bytes and infected .EXE to grow by 1,808-1,822 bytes. Additionally, it can re-infect .EXE files. * Carfield (Jeru-Carfield): The virus causes infected files to grow by 1,508 bytes. If the virus is memory-resident and the day is Monday, the computer will display the string \\"Carfield!\\" every 42 seconds. * Mendoza (Jerusalem Mendoza): The virus does nothing if the year is 1980 or 1989, but for all other years a flag is set if the virus is memory resident and if the floppy disk motor count is 25. The flag will be set if a program is run from a floppy disk. If the flag is set, every program which runs is deleted. If the flag is not set and 30 minutes passes, the cursor is changed to a block. After one hour, Caps Lock, Nums Lock, and Scroll Lock are switched to \\"Off\\". Additionally, it does not re-infect .EXE files. * Einstein: This is a small variant, only 878 bytes, and infects .EXE files. * Moctezuma: This variant virus is 2,228 bytes and is encrypted. * Century: This variant is a logic bomb with trigger date of January 1, 2000 that was supposed to display the message \\"Welcome to the 21st Century\\". However, no one is sure as to the legitimacy of the virus, as no one has seen it. * Danube: The Danube virus is a unique variant of Jerusalem, as it has evolved beyond Jerusalem and only reflects very few parts of it. This virus is a multipartite virus, so it has several methods by which it can infect and spread: disk boot sectors as well as .COM and .EXE files. Because of this, how the virus works is dependent upon the origin of the virus (boot sector or program). When a contaminated program is executed, the virus resides in memory, taking 5 kB. Additionally, it will check if it also resides in the active boot sector and will place a copy of itself there if it was not present before. When a computer is booted from a contaminated boot sector/disk, the virus will place itself in memory before the operating system is even loaded. It reserves 5 kB of DOS base memory, and reserves 5 sectors on any disk it infects. * HK: This variant of Jerusalem originates from Hong Kong, and references one of Hong Kong's technical schools in its code. * Jerusalem-1767: This virus infects .EXE and .COM files, and will infect COMMAND.COM if it is executes. It causes .COM files to grow by 1,767 bytes and .EXE to grow by 1,767-1,799 bytes. Infected files include the strings \\"INFECTED BY FRIDAY 13th\\" or \\"COMMAND.COM\\". * Jerusalem-1663: This virus infects .EXE and .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. Once memory resident, it infects programs as they are run. It causes .COM and .EXE files to grow by 1,663 bytes, but it cannot recognize infected files, so it may re-infect both .COM and .EXE files. * Jerusalem-Haifa: This virus infects .EXE and .COM files, but not COMMAND.COM. It causes .COM files to grow by 2,178 bytes and .EXE files to grow by 1,960-1,974 bytes. Its name is due to the Hebrew word for Haifa, an Israeli city, being in the virus code. * Phenome: This virus is similar to the Apocalypse variant, but will infect COMMAND.COM. It only activates on Saturdays, and does not allow the user to execute programs. It features the string \\"PHENOME.COM\\" and \\"MsDos\\".

Willem van Aelst (16 May 1627 ‚Äì buried 22 May 1683)Aelst, Willem van at the RKD was a Dutch Golden Age artist who specialized in still-life painting with flowers or game. Biography Van Aelst was born in Delft to a family of prominent city magistrates. He learned to paint from his uncle, the still-life painter Evert van Aelst. On 9 November 1643 he enrolled as a master of the Guild of Saint Luke at Delft. Between 1645 and 1649 he lived in France. In 1649 Van Aelst travelled to Florence, where he served as court painter to Ferdinando II de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany. Here he was known as Guillielmo d'Olanda. At this time, the grand duke also employed two fellow Dutchmen Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, the latter also a still-life painter who probably influenced Van Aelst's style. Ferdinando II publicly presented Van Aelst with a gold chain and medal, as a testimony of his approbation and an acknowledgement of his talents. It has been conjectured that Van Aelst visited Rome where he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. This conjecture is based, not very convincingly, on his practice during the years 1657/58 to sign his works with his name followed by: ‚Äòalias (and a drawn stick figure)'. Some interpreted this as a reference to a Bent name (the nickname that a member of the Bentvueghels would adopt) ‚Äì De Vogelverschrikker (Dutch for 'scarecrow')- but there are no documents confirming this.Biografische gegevens op Hadrianus In 1656 he returned to the Netherlands to settle permanently in Amsterdam. He became one of the most prominent still- life painters of his generation, which allowed him to live on the Prinsengracht. He must have at Amsterdam died in 1683 or shortly thereafter, as his latest dated work is from that year. Van Aelst taught Rachel Ruysch, Isaac Denies, Maria van Oosterwijck, and Ernst Stuven.

Nadbai is divided into Katra and Nadbai. Nadbai is also famous for education. It is known as a MINI KOTA. Geography Sunset in Nadbai Nadbai is located at . It has an average elevation of 205 metres (672 feet) Demographics India census, Nadbai had a population of 26,300. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Nadbai has an average literacy rate of 64%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 53%. In Nadbai, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age.  History  Umbrella of Mohammad Ghori's Knight It is believed that around 1000 years ago a man named Nanda or Nandoo, who was a milkman from nearby village Katara, populated this village and the village named after him. It is also believed that during the British Raj, this town couldn't be captured, so people called it \\"Na Dabi\\", which means \\"not captured\\"; later it became Nadbai. The town is also known as Asifabad. According to some legends the town was attacked and confiscated by a smaller group of soldiers led by knight of Mohammad Ghori, Asif Khan aka Yusuf Zai Ghaznavi and drove the locals out. The town was granted to Asif Khan and his soldiers as a reward by the Sultan. Asif Khan flourished the town/village and named it Asifabad which is currently documented in the royal decree. Current landscape and architecture including buildings and mosques appears to prove that this land has seen great scholars and high-ranked individuals. This town had High Court and police headquarters for the kingdom and was directly connected to the Royal Court. The royal messages and documents used to be addressed directly to Qazi Shai and Qazi Yoonus. Later In 1773 the town was captured by Mirza Najaf Khan and ruled till 1782, when the Jat rulars of Bharatpur at that time took control of Nadbai. During the rule of Mirza Najaf Khan, a significant population of Sunni sect Muslims were forced to migrate to other cities, as he wanted to convert them into Shia sect for which they refused at any cost. Thereafter, as a result of confiscation of land and properties of sunni Muslims and brutalities by Mirza Najaf Khan, majority of Asifians moved to various regions of Rajputana (i.e. Kota, Jhalawar, Bundi, Ajmer towns), and various adjacent states of India at that time. Just after partition of the sub continent, in 1947, and afterwards also, hundreds of Asifian (Nadbayyan) families migrated from various regions of Rajputana, voluntarily, to Pakistan side. Majority of them opted to settle in the Sindh province of Pakistan (mostly in Karachi, Hyderabad and Sukkur regions). In Karachi, at present, there is a registered housing society and its office which is located at Block 17 of Federal B Area in Karachi central. In this housing society, which was named as Asifia co-operative Housing Society, at present, a significant population of Asifians are residing. The Asifians are contributing in all walks of life in the Pakistani society as educationists (e.g. Prof. Dr. Hamid Mahmood PhD, and Prof. Dr. Moinuddin Ghori PhD), civil service (e.g.Khwaja Altaf Husain Ghori, Mohammad Masood Ahmed Qureshi and Umar Daraz Khan Ghori), doctors (e.g. Dr. Mughis Sheerani), business (e.g. Syed Sarfaraz Ali Ghori), fine arts (e.g. Saleemuddin Ghori), sports (e.g.test cricketers Alimuddin and Asad Shafiq) etc. Nowadays Nadbai is also famous in Rajasthan by the name of Mini Kota as students from various district of Rajasthan come to Nadbai for study up to senior secondary.

Shortly after launching in September 1940 she was to be commissioned by the Royal Navy as HMS Urchin, but instead was leased to the Polish Navy due to a lack of experienced submarine crews. A sister boat to , both boats operated in the Mediterranean from Malta, where they became known as the \\"Terrible Twins\\". Polish service Shortly after her trials, the boat was handed to her Polish crew, in accordance with the Anglo-Polish military alliance and amendments of 18 November 1939 and 3 December 1940. On 19 January 1941 the Polish banner was raised and the boat, commanded by Commander Borys Karnicki, was moved to Portsmouth. There she spent half a year patrolling the Bay of Biscay off the French port of Brest. In September she was moved to Malta, where she was attached to the 10th Submarine Flotilla. She took part in the naval runs on the Italian ports of Taranto and Naples. She also escorted numerous convoys in the Mediterranean. On 28 October of that year, Sok√≥≈Ç achieved her first victory by heavily damaging the Italian auxiliary cruiser Citt√† di Palermo. On 2 November in the Gulf of Naples she sank the 2,469-ton transport ship Balilla, with her sister . On 19 November of the same year, she forced the anti-submarine nets and entered the port of Navarino, where she damaged the Italian destroyer . She was attacked by Italian torpedo boats and destroyers, but all of the depth charges missed and Sok√≥≈Ç managed to escape from the harbour, sinking an additional transport steamer (5,600 tons) with three torpedoes. On 12 February 1942 she boarded and then sank the Italian wooden merchant schooner Giuseppina (362 tons) in the Gulf of Gabes. On 17 April while in the port of Malta, she was heavily damaged by a German air raid and was forced to return to the shipyard in Blyth to receive repairs. By mid-1943 she had returned to the Mediterranean, where she continued to harass enemy shipment off the coasts of Italy, Northern Africa and in the Adriatic. On 12 September she rammed and sank the fishing vessel Meattini (36 tons). She took part in the allied blockade of the naval bases in Naples and Pula. Off the coast of the latter port, transferred by the Italians to Nazi Germany, Sok√≥≈Ç sank a munitions transport (probably the 7,095-ton ) and three days afterwards on 11 November the Italian schooner Argentina (64 tons). Between 4 November 1943 and 25 February 1944 she operated in the Aegean from the naval base in Beirut. Among the ships sunk in that period were two transport ships, four schooners and one cutter. In March 1944 both of the \\"Terrible Twins\\" left Malta for Great Britain where they were attached to the Dundee-based 9th submarine flotilla. After an additional four patrols off the coast of Norway, in the spring of 1945 she was designated as a training ship and was used by the Royal Air Force for training naval bomber pilots. Wartime tally Altogether, during her wartime service Sok√≥≈Ç sank or damaged 19 enemy vessels of about 55,000 tons in total. All of the commanding officers of the boat, (Lieutenant Commander Karnicki, Lieutenant Commander Kozio≈Çkowski and Captain Bernas) were awarded the Virtuti Militari. The full patrol records of the ORP Sok√≥≈Ç are stored at the National Record Office, Kew, England. Royal Navy service Returned to the Royal Navy on 27 July 1945 as HMS Urchin, she served for a further four years. Fate Urchin was decommissioned in December 1948 and scrapped in September 1949.

They may be a figure of a person, animal or inanimate object. Paper dolls have been inexpensive children's toys for almost two hundred years. Today, many artists are turning paper dolls into an art form. Paper dolls have been used for advertising, appeared in magazines and newspapers, and covered a variety of subjects and time periods. Over the years, they have been used to reinforce cultural beliefs regarding the appearance of ideal women. Today, they have become highly sought-after collectibles, especially as vintage paper dolls become rarer due to the limited lifespan of paper objects. Paper dolls are still being created today. Some flat plastic figures are similar to paper dolls, like Colorforms figures and Flatsy dolls, but these are mere imitations and not considered true archetypal characteristics of the paper doll art form. Magnetized versions of paper dolls have also been produced over the years. Paper dolls have regained popularity with young children featuring popular characters and celebrities. Online and virtual paper dolls like KiSS, Stardoll and Doll makers also have a popular following, with users able to drag and drop images of clothes onto images of dolls or actual people. History 1919 magazine illustration of actress Norma Talmadge and some of her film costumes in paper doll form Paper dolls have been around as long as there has been paper, perhaps hundreds or even thousands of years by some estimates. Faces or other objects were applied to the paper and they were used during religious rituals and ceremonies in the Asian cultures many centuries ago. The Japanese used paper for Origami, artful paper folding, and dating back to 800 AD they folded paper figurines in the shape of Kimono. Balinese people made paper and leather into puppets since before the Common Era. Other cultures around the world have had paper formations or paper art, including in Poland, where they were called Wycinanki. These early types of paper figures differ from typical paper dolls today, as no clothes were made to be used with the dolls. The first manufactured paper doll was ‚ÄúLittle Fanny‚Äù, produced by S&J; Fuller, London, in 1810 http://www.opdag.com/history.html In Europe, particularly France, the first paper dolls were popular since the mid-18th century. The oldest known paper doll card is hosted by Germanisches Nationalmuseum and was printed around 1650 in Southern Germany, showing two female figures with a number of dresses, pieces of headgear, hairstyles and accessories. The paper was jointed and they were called pantins meaning dancing or jumping jack puppet. They were intended to entertain adults and spread throughout high society. They were drawn or painted like people with fashions for each doll. These were more similar to contemporary Western paper dolls. Rare hand-painted sets of paper figures dating to the late 1780s can be found in some museums today.La historia a trav√©s de los recortables (in Spanish) \\"The History and Adventures of Little Henry,\\" by J. Belcher, was the first American toy that included paper dolls. Published in 1812, this book prompted children to act out various scenes with the paper dolls that were included. The biggest American producer of paper dolls, McLoughlin Brothers, was founded in early 1800 and was sold to Milton Bradley in 1920s. Around this time paper dolls became popular in the USA and then grew in popularity in the following decades. The rise of paper doll production in the mid-19th century to mid-20th century was partially due to technological advances that made printing significantly cheaper. Paper doll with clothes Book publishing companies that followed in the production of paper dolls or cut-outs were Lowe, Whitman, Saalfield and Merrill among others. Movie stars and celebrities became the focus in the early days of paper dolls in the USA. Paper dolls are still produced today and Whitman and Golden Co. still publish paper dolls. Besides movie stars, women of leisure tend to be the women featured in paper doll form. As more women began to enter the work force in the twentieth-century, paper doll manufacturers began to produce dolls that represented career women. The women's rights movement in mid-20th century was partially responsible for instigating this change. Brides were another common figure often represented in paper doll form. Vintage paper dolls with hand-painted artwork are becoming increasingly rare due to paper aging issues. They have become collectible, and the prices for mint uncut sets can range from $100 to over $500 for a sought after title. A paper doll convention is held every year in the United States. In 2016, one was held in Phoenix, Arizona.http://10times.com/doll-convention  See also  * Jumping jack (toy) * Margaret G.

In 1788, he published Mathematical Essays, on several subjects and in 1802 in two volumes, The Analytical Institutions, originally written in Italian, by Maria Gaetana Agnesi, translated by John Colson. Taking orders, Hellins was for some time curate of Constantine in Cornwall and, afterwards, of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire, but in 1790 he was presented by the Earl Bathurst to the vicarage of Potterspury in Northamptonshire. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1796, and in 1800 took the degree of BD at Trinity College, Cambridge. Hellins at one time computed the Nautical Almanac. He later assisted at Greenwich and, furnished William Windham with calculations and tables on which to base his new military system, as Minister of War, in 1806. Hellins applied himself also branches of pure mathematics. Nine communications from him appeared in the Philosophical Transactions: *On the summation of series. *On the conversion of slowly-converging series into others of swifter convergency. *On their application to the calculation of logarithms, and to the verifying of circular area. *On the roots of equations.

The term was introduced by American philosopher Donald Davidson (1973) and is meant to suggest important similarity to W. V. O. Quine's term radical translation, which occurs in his work on the indeterminacy of translation. Radical translation is translation of a speaker's language, without prior knowledge, by observing the speaker's use of the language in context.Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation. Originally published in Dialectica, 27 (1973), 314-28. Reprinted in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (2n. ed. 125-39). New York: Clarendon Press. Even more so than radical translation did for Quine, radical interpretation plays an important role in Davidson's work, but the exact nature of this role is up for debate. Some see Davidson as using radical interpretation directly in his arguments against conceptual relativism and the possibility of massive error-- of most of our beliefs being false.Lepore, Ernest and Kirk Ludwig. Donald Davidson: Meaning, Truth, Language and Reality. Oxford. 2005. But Davidson seems to explicitly reject this reading in \\"Radical Interpretation Interpreted\\".Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation Interpreted. Philosophical Perspectives, 8 (1994), 121-128. There is also a more narrow and technical version of radical interpretation used by Davidson: given the speaker's attitudes of holding particular sentences true in particular circumstances, the speaker's hold-true attitudes, the radical interpreter is to infer a theory of meaning, a truth theory meeting a modified version of Alfred Tarski's Convention T, for the speaker's idiolect. Ernest Lepore and Kirk Ludwig characterize this as inference from sentences of the form: :Ceteris paribus, S holds true s at t if and only if p. to corresponding T-sentences of the form :s is true (S, t) if and only if q where s is a sentence in the idiolect of the speaker S, t is a time, and p and q are filled in with sentences in the metalanguage.

It aired on the ABC network in the United States. Known as the Julie Andrews Show in the UK and aired on the ITV network. In order to secure Andrews, Sir Lew Grade and ABC offered her a generous five-year contract which included not only Andrews starring in a weekly television variety show, but also allowing her to do films. In 1963, when another major star, Judy Garland, was signed to a weekly television variety series, it failed to catch on with the public. One of the main reasons for its demise was its constant change of format and the fact that critics and audiences felt that Garland was not shown off to her best advantage. In order to avoid that error, Andrews asked producer Nick Vanoff what the premise of the show would be about. Vanoff immediately answered her by saying \\"Julie Andrews ... without Julie Andrews there is no Julie Andrews Hour.\\" The premiere installment of the show was presented on Wednesday, 13 September 1972 at 10:00 P.M. ET. As a way of introducing Julie Andrews to the vast television audience, the entire hour of the first episode showcased the singer performing in musical numbers ranging from her years on Broadway (The Boy Friend, My Fair Lady, and Camelot) to her motion picture career (Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and Star!). Appearing with Andrews on this episode were impressionist Rich Little and comedienne Alice Ghostley (who had appeared with Andrews in the 1957 CBS live television version of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella). Both Little and Ghostley would become semi- regulars. The series received unanimously rave reviews, unfortunately, its time slot proved to be daunting because it was up against the popular CBS detective series, Cannon. Another reason for the low ratings was that the lateness of the hour was not conducive to family viewing since children were in bed by that time. On Thanksgiving Eve, 22 November 1972, The Julie Andrews Hour devoted an entire episode saluting Walt Disney. To make it more of a \\"family special\\", ABC switched the time slot of The Julie Andrews Hour that night to 8:30 P.M. and The ABC Wednesday Movie Of The Week to 9:30 P.M. The ratings improved a little, so ABC then made a decision to alternate Andrews' time period each week. (One week it would be 10:00 P.M., and the next week it would be 8:30 P.M.) This continued until January 1973, when the series was moved to Saturday nights at 9:00 P.M. The ratings went from bad to worse, as Andrews' chief competition was The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show (both highly rated series) on CBS. (Ironically, Moore had been Andrews' co-star in the 1967 hit film, Thoroughly Modern Millie.) Andrews was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (for Best Actress In A Leading Role -- Musical Or Comedy Series for the show);Hollywood Foreign Press Association Golden Globes archives -- Julie Andrews, accessed 21 January 2007 she lost out to Jean Stapleton in All in the Family.Hollywood Foreign Press Association Golden Globes archives -- Jean Stapleton, accessed 21 January 2007 When the 1972-1973 Emmy Award nominations were announced,The Julie Andrews Hour received an impressive ten nominations. Despite this achievement plus the rave reviews, ABC announced it was cancelling the series after its 24th episode in April 1973. After Andrews completed the last installment of the program, she and her husband Blake Edwards left for Barbados to film The Tamarind Seed which was part of her contract agreement with ABC and ITC. In May, 1973, The Julie Andrews Hour went on to win seven Emmy Awards out of its ten nominations, including the Outstanding Variety Musical Series award given to the show's producers, Nick Vanoff and William O. Harbach, and the star.Internet Movie Database Emmy Awards: 1973, accessed 21 January 2006 In recognition of all the awards her show received and as a consolation to her series being cancelled, ABC and ITV offered Andrews five variety specials which were produced in England between 1973 and 1975, also under the auspices of Lew Grade. This was also arranged to help fulfill Andrews's five-year contract. However, after her fifth special aired in the spring of 1975, the contract was mutually dissolved. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, several edited episodes of The Julie Andrews Hour were shown on syndicated stations throughout the United States as \\"specials\\". Musical themes The show opened with an excerpt of the title song from The Sound of Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Andrews performed \\"Time Is My Friend\\" to close each episode.

London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 6. The difference is between actual prices paid, and information about possible, potential or likely prices, or \\"average\\" price levels.\\"...existing price-theories do not concern themselves directly with actual market-prices, at which commodities are in fact sold and bought on the market, but with purely theoretical ideal 'equilibrium' prices. The only way in which such theories are allegedly related to real prices is indirectly, through the supposition that the ideal unit-price of each commodity-type is the long-term time-average of its real unit-price.\\" Emmanuel Farjoun & Moshe Machover, The Laws of Chaos. London: Verso, 1983, p. 103. This distinction should not be confused with the difference between \\"nominal prices\\" (current-value) and \\"real prices\\" (adjusted for price inflation, and/or tax and/or ancillary charges).A \\"nominal price\\" is sometimes also understood as a price formality which is only a reference, and differs from the actual deal struck. It is more similar to, though not identical with, the distinction between \\"theoretical value\\" and \\"market price\\" in financial economics.Nasser Saber, Speculative Capital, Vol. 1. London: Pearson Education, 1999, p. 39. Characteristics Ideal prices, expressed in money-units, can be \\"estimated\\", \\"theorized\\" or \\"imputed\\" for accounting, trading, marketing or calculation purposes, for example using the law of averages. Often the actual prices of real transactions are combined with assumed prices, for the purpose of a price calculation or estimate. Even if such prices therefore may not directly correspond to transactions involving actually traded products, assets or services, they can nevertheless provide \\"price signals\\" which influence economic behavior. For example, if statisticians publish aggregated price estimates about the economy as a whole, market actors are likely to respond to this price information, even if it is far from exact, if it is based on a very large number of assumptions, and if it is later revised. The release of new GDP data, for instance, often has an immediate effect on stock market activity, insofar as it is interpreted as an indicator of whether and how fast the market ‚Äì and consequently the incomes generated by it ‚Äì is growing or declining. Ideal prices are typically prices that would apply in trade, if certain assumed conditions apply (and they may not). The number of ideal prices used for calculations or signalling in the world vastly exceeds the number of real prices fetched. At any point in time, most economic goods and services in society are being owned or used, but not traded; nevertheless people are constantly extrapolating prices which would apply if they were traded in markets or if they had to be replaced. Such price information is essential to estimate the possible incomes, budgetary implications or expenditures associated with a transaction. The distinction is currently best known in the profession of auditing.Handbook of international standards on auditing and quality control. New York: International Federation of Accountants, 2009. \\"A difference between the outcome of an accounting estimate and the amount originally recognized or disclosed in the financial statements does not necessarily represent a misstatement of the financial statements. This is particularly the case for fair value accounting estimates, as any observed outcome is invariably affected by events or conditions subsequent to the date at which the measurement is estimated for purposes of the financial statements.\\" (pp. 472‚Äì73) \\"However, estimation uncertainty may exist even when the valuation method and data are well defined.\\" (p. 479) \\"...International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 defines fair value as \\"the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.\\" The concept of fair value ordinarily assumes a current transaction, rather than settlement at some past or future date. Accordingly, the process of measuring fair value would be a search for the estimated price at which that transaction would occur.\\" (p. 512). It also has enormous significance for economic theory, and more specifically for econometric measurement and price theory; the main reason is that price data is very often the basis for making economic and policy decisions. Karl Marx A distinction between real (or actual) prices and ideal prices, was introduced in Marx's Grundrisse notebooks.Karl Marx, Grundrisse. New York: Vintage Books, 1973, p. 402. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859),Karl Marx,A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859), chapter 2, Note B: Theories of the Standard of Money. Marx already criticizes James Steuart and John Gray because they fudged the distinction between actual prices and ideal prices.Costas Lapavitsas, Profiting without producing. London: Verso, 2014, p. 79. In chapter 3 of the first volume of Das Kapital, Marx states: The activity of pricing goods, services and assets, facilitating transactions, communicating prices and keeping track of them in fact consumes a very large amount of human labour- time, irrespective of whether it happens to occur in a centralized or decentralized way. Millions of workers are professionally specialized in such activities, whether as clerks, tellers, buyers, retail assistants, accountants, financial advisors, bank workers, or economists etc. If that work is not done, price information would not be available, with the result that the trading process would become difficult or impossible to operate. Whether or not this is considered \\"bureaucratic\\", it therefore remains an essential administrative service. People cannot \\"choose between prices\\" if they don't even know what those prices are; and, normally, they cannot just \\"make up\\" any kind of price they like, because costing, budgets and incomes depend precisely on what price is charged. The creation of price information is a production process ‚Äì its output is worth money, because it is vital for the purpose of trade, and without it the circulation of goods and services could not occur. Price information can therefore be bought and sold as a commodity as well. But the production process of prices themselves is often hidden from view and hardly noticeable. Therefore, people often take the existence of price information for granted and as obvious, meriting no further inquiry. \\"A mysterious certainty dominates our lives in late capitalist modernity: the price. Not a single day passes without learning, making, and taking it. Yet despite prices' widespread presence around us, we do not know much about them.\\"Koray √áalƒ±≈ükan, \\"Price as a Market Device: Cotton Trading in Izmir Mercantile Exchange\\". In M. Callon, Y. Millo and F. Muniesa (eds.) Market Devices. London: Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 241. A price may also be attached in the course of another activity, or the pricing procedure may be a closely guarded secret rather than accessible in an open market because if competitors knew about it, this could adversely affect business income.\\"According to the Information Security Oversight Office, which keeps watch over the U.S. government's secrets, more than 3.5 million new secrets are created each year.' That works out to almost 10,000 new secrets a day. No doubt many more secrets were not even recorded. Until recently, even the rules and criteria for classifying and declassifying secret information were themselves secret. There are now two million officials in government and another one million in private industry with the authority to classify documents.\\" Dennis F. Thompson, \\"Democratic Secrecy,\\" Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 114, No. 2, Summer 1999, p. 181. But if pricing processes are viewed as production processes, it turns out that much more is involved than the observation of a price-tag or number might suggest. For most of the history of economics, economic theorists were not primarily concerned with explaining the actual, real price-levels. Instead their theorizing was concerned with theoretical (ideal) prices. Simon Clarke explains for example: It is only relatively recently that economists have tried to create generalizations about the actual pricing procedures used by business enterprises, based on information about what business people actually do (instead of an abstract mathematical model).Frederic S. Lee, Post-Keynesian Price Theory. Cambridge University Press, 1999. Illustrations of ideal prices *An example would be an equilibrium price calculated by an economist. This is a price which a type of product or asset would theoretically have, if supply and demand were balanced. This price does not exist in actual trading processes except in special and rare cases; it is only an ideal or theoretical price level, which at best is only approximated in the real world. *In accounting practice, ideal prices are used all the time. For example, when accountants have to value a stock of assets, or a set of transactions across an interval of time (for tax, commercial or audit purposes), they apply rules and criteria to arrive at a price reflecting the cost or market-value of the stock or flow of transactions. In grossing and netting, they apply certain rules of inclusion and exclusion to obtain the desired measure. But the valuation obtained following a standard procedure is in truth only hypothetical, because it represents a price which the assets or flows would have if they were traded or exchanged under assumed (stylized or standardized) conditions, or if they were replaced at a certain point in time. In principle, they need not refer to any real transaction flows at all, being only an imputation. Yet, the ideal price obtained may nevertheless influence very many transactions based on it, to the extent that it provides information and a measure of how a related market process is thought to be evolving. *Ideal prices are often used in price negotiations, bidding, price estimation and insurance. These are calculated prices for things being traded, or the compensation which would be given, if certain conditions apply. Business deals can become very complex, and may involve numerous price assumptions. For example, the contract may be that if an average price trend occurs, then a certain amount of money will be paid out. Thus, the actual amount of money that changes hands may be conditional on a variety of price estimates. Actual and potential prices When goods are produced for sale, they may be priced, but those prices are initially only potential prices. There may not be any certainty about whether they will all fetch exactly the sum of money stated by those prices when they are actually sold, or whether they will be sold at all. In retrospect, the final value of an output, activity or asset may turn out to have been higher or lower than previously anticipated, because for various reasons prices and demand changed in the meantime. Thus, price negotiations, trading circumstances and the time factor may change actual prices realized from the prices originally set, and if price inflation occurs there is in addition a difference between the nominal prices and the inflation-adjusted price. The price of a stock or a debt security, expressed in a given currency, may be highly variable, and their variable yields may in turn revalue or devalue the prices of related assets. Thus, the \\"price mechanism\\" is often not simply a function of supply and demand for a tradable object, but of a structure of related and co-existing prices, where fluctuations in one group of prices impact on another group of prices, perhaps quite contrary to the wishes of buyers and sellers. In this sense, the concept of a \\"price shock\\" refers to a drastic change in the price of a good which is widely used, and which therefore suddenly changes many related prices. The sale price may be modified also by the difference in time between purchase and payment. For example, someone may opt to buy a product on credit, and pay interest in addition to the asking price for the product. The interest charge may vary during the interval in which the principal is paid off. Or, the price may change because of price inflation or because it is renegotiated. If it is not possible to pay for something within the previously expected time interval, that may also change prices. Mike Beggs explains why credit instruments complicate the distinction between actual and ideal prices: The effect of credit instruments is, that actual payments are removed in space and time from the trade in debt obligations, and indeed the trade in debt can occur without necessarily involving any transactions with real money. In turn, this blurs the distinction between actual money (i.e. hard cash) and ideal money, or between real and ideal prices. In developed economies, cash in circulation normally ranges from 6% to 8% of GDP, but the debts of private banks alone are already a multiple of GDP (in the EU area, about 3.5x the total GDP).George Georgiopoulos, \\"Cash airlift helped avert Greek bank run during debt crisis: paper\\". Reuters online, 3 March 2013. √âric Toussaint, Banks versus the People: The Underside of a Rigged Game!. International Viewpoint, 22 January 2013. Valuation criteria in pricing Consequently, what the \\"real\\" price of a thing is, might be a topic of dispute, because it may involve conditions and valuation criteria which some would not accept, because they apply different valuation criteria, different conditions or have a different purpose. For example, an asset or product may be valued by accountants and statisticians at: *its historic cost, *its book value, *its accounting value, *its current market value, *its nominal value, *its accrual value, *its discounted, sale, bundle or groupon value, *its value for legal purposes, *its gross or net value, *its current replacement value, *its current trading value, *its warehouse or shop value when stored, *its value given its current location (or locational value) *its FOB value *its value before or after transport costs, *its transfer pricing value *its value in terms of its future earnings potential, *its insurance value, *its value for tax purposes *its pre-tax or post-tax value *its depreciated value, *its inflation-adjusted value, *its value given a risk of loss of value, *its value if it is traded at a specific time, *its value in a foreign currency, *its value at purchasing power parity *its final value, *its scrap value etc. A price can be computed for each of these valuations, depending on one's purpose. Often the purpose is assumed to be self-evident, being related to a specific transaction, and thus what the price of something is, is taken as obvious. But an object or activity can in reality be priced in many different ways, depending on what valuation is relevant, or what price is negotiated. In modern banking, there are literally hundreds of additional conventions used to value assets under a variety of conditions. Price abstraction The price resulting from a calculation may be regarded as symbolizing (representing) one transaction, or many transactions at once, but the validity of this \\"price abstraction\\" all depends on whether the computational procedure and valuation method are accepted. The use of ideal prices for the purpose of accounting, estimation and theorising has become so habitual and ingrained in modern society, that they are frequently confused with the real prices actually realised in trade. Prices may be viewed only as a kind of data, information, or a type of knowledge, or the information available about a money quantity may be equated with the \\"real thing\\". The concept of price is often used in a very loose sense to refer to all kinds of transactional possibilities. That can lead to theoretical errors.Richard Ebeling, \\"What is a price? Explanation and understanding.\\" pp. 174-191 in: Don Lavoie (ed.), Economics and hermeneutics. London: Routledge, 1990. The notion of \\"the price of something\\" is often applied to sums of money denoting various quite different financial categories (e.g. a purchase or sale cost, the amount of a liability, the amount of a compensation, an asset value, an asset yield, an interest rate etc.). For example, an interest rate can be defined as the \\"price\\" of borrowing money for a period of time.Milton Friedman, Price Theory. Chicago: Aldine, 1976, p. 10. Here, the concept of price is used in the loose sense of \\"a cost\\" or \\"a compensation.\\" This loose sense means that the distinction between actual prices and ideal prices is lost. In turn, that means that the concept of price then stands for any kind of commercial valuation we care to make. Any activity, thing or transaction has its \\"price-tag\\", so to speak. It can be difficult to work out, even for an economist, what a price really means, and price information can be deceptive. Ideal prices are typically prices that would apply in trade, if certain assumed conditions apply (and they may not). Hence ideal prices are typically not observable, but instead inferences from observables. Transactions are registered in accounts, the accounting information is aggregated up to compute price data, and this data is in turn used to estimate price trends. In the process of so doing, there is a transition from observable price magnitudes to inferred price magnitudes. At best one could say, that the inferred price magnitudes are based on observable price magnitudes, but the link between them can be rather tenuous, since specific valuation assumptions may be introduced, so that the calculation procedure goes far beyond a simple arithmetical aggregation. Purely theoretical prices used for analytical purposes may have no correlate in the real world, or how exactly they relate to the real world may be unknown. The knowledge of prices may have an effect influencing trading possibilities, which in turn changes the knowledge of prices. Consequently, such knowledge is often kept confidential or is a business secret (see also information security and sociological aspects of secrecy). A price system is therefore not necessarily transparent at all, quite apart from disputes over how a price is calculated, estimated or derived. Are prices exact? Money-prices are numbers, and numbers can be computed with exactitude. This seems to make accounting and economics exact sciences. But in the real world, prices can change quickly, due to innumerable conditions and it may be that prices can only be estimated approximately for budgetary or contractual purposes. In aggregating them, a judgement is made about the meaning of the transactions involved, and boundaries are defined for where they begin and end. Consequently, in calculating price quantities, valuation principles of some sort is usually applied, regardless of whether this is made explicit or not. And, typically, this value theory refers to prices which would apply under certain assumed (theoretical) conditions, moving between real prices and ideal prices. In an interview, the late Beno√Æt Mandelbrot cited Louis Bachelier's thesis that prices have only one parameter defining their variability: they \\"can only go up or down\\" ‚Äì and that, then, seems to provide a robust logical foundation for the mathematical modelling of price movements.John Authers, \\"Why 'efficient markets' collapse\\", video interview with Benoit Mandelbrot, in: Financial Times website, 30 September 2009 But this sidesteps the qualitative problem that many different prices can be calculated for the same good, for all kinds of different purposes, using different valuation assumptions or transaction conditions. Bachelier's idea already assumes that we have a standard way to measure prices. Given that standard, one can then perform all kinds of mathematical operations on price distributions. Yet tradeable objects can also be combined and repackaged in numerous different ways, in which case the referent price may not simply go up or down, but instead refers to a different kind of deal. This issue is well known to official statisticians and economic historians, because they face the problem that the very objects whose price movements they aim to track change qualitatively across time, which may necessitate adjustments of the classification systems used to provide standard measures. A good example of that is the regimen of the consumer price index, which is periodically revised. But in times of rapid social change, the problem of devising a standard measure may be much more pervasive. The mathematician John Allen Paulos stated that: It may of course be that not \\"almost any desired outcome can be reached\\" in price calculations, insofar as one would have to deny relevant evidence. Nevertheless, it may be that several different outcomes are possible, or that the presence of biases in interpreting price information can make a significant quantitative difference to the result. Insofar as economic actors have a vested self-interest in a particular quantitative result, because their income is at stake, then there is the possibility that they will prefer \\"one sort of calculation\\" to another, because it yields a financial result that favours their own position. That financial result may be reasonably \\"credible\\" or \\"plausible\\" for the purpose of trading - if it was way out of kilter, trading partners would reject it - but it could involve a margin of distortion of the true situation. The small discrepancies would ordinarily not matter so much in individual transactions, but if a very large number of transactions is added up, the distortion might represent a substantial income for someone. For example, on 27 June 2012, Barclays Bank was fined $200m by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $150m by the United States Department of Justice and ¬£59.5m by the Financial Services Authority for attempted manipulation of the Libor and Euribor rates (see Libor scandal). FASB and the epistemology of prices The Financial Accounting Standards BoardFASB makes it very explicit that accounting measures for price information may not be completely exact or fully accurate, and that they may not be completely verifiable or absolutely authoritative. They may only be an approximation or estimate of a state of affairs. A price aggregate may be made up from a very large number of transactions and prices, which cannot all be individually checked, and the monetary value of which may involve a certain amount of interpretation. For example, a price may be set but we may not know for sure whether a good or asset actually traded at this price, or how far exactly the actual price paid diverged from the ordinary set price. However, the Board argues that, within certain acceptable limits of error, this is not a problem, so long as we bear in mind the practical purpose of the measures: The economic calculation problem and prices In the classic socialist calculation debate,David Ramsay Steele, From Marx to Mises: post-capitalist society and the challenge of economic calculation. La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Publishing Company, 1992. economic calculation was a problem for centrally planned economies. Necessarily the central planners had to engage in price accounting, and had to use price information, but the volume and complexity of transactions was so great, that genuine central planning of the economy was often not really feasible in practice; often the state authority could only enforce the conditions of access to resources with the aid of extensive policing. An additional problem was, that much of the price information was actually false or inaccurate, because economic actors had no interest in providing truthful information, because the nominal price of goods did not reflect their value, or because goods changed hands informally in ways which could not be formally recorded and known. The effect was that the computed accounting information was often a mixture of fact and fiction. Pricing issues Market economies often suffer from similar defects, in the sense that commercial price information is in practice deficient, false, distorted or inaccurate. This is not necessarily because trading parties intend to deceive - generally speaking, deception is bad for business reputations, at least in the long runSarah Maxwell, The price is wrong. Understanding What Makes a Price Seem Fair and the True cost of unfair pricing. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. \\\\- but simply because it is technically impossible to provide fully exact price information. Official price estimates can be inaccurate, rely on dubious valuation assumptions contrary to reality, or fail to be verified thoroughly, among other things because they rely on sample survey techniques or partial and infrequent information. Business price signals are not intrinsically always clear; they can be deceptive, understating or overstating the real situation, or present a completely false picture of transactions and values.Oskar Morgenstern, On the Accuracy of Economic Observations, 2nd edition, Princeton University Press, 1965. Jean- Claude Trichet for example remarked in 2008 about the global financial crisis that: Trichet's suggestion is that completely wrong pricing occurred, with devastating results. A \\"unit of risk\\" does not really exist, but this category can nevertheless be thought of as the quantity of money which represents a \\"possible\\" financial loss. Risk-pricing is intrinsically a problem-fraught process, since it relies on assumptions about unknowns, in advance of actual events, and these unknowns may include factors that were not previously anticipated or included in the mathematical models. Price discovery and information asymmetry Commenting on the information problems associated with prices, Randall S. Kroszner, a Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, theorizes: In addition to the discrepancies between real prices and ideal prices, it may in fact be impossible at any one time to know what the \\"correct\\" price of something ought to be, even although it is being traded anyway, for an actual price. The \\"correct\\" price level is only an ideal price, namely a price at which supply and demand would tend towards balance. But because of inadequate information, that price may never be reached; supply and demand may only haphazardly adjust to each other using inadequate information. Just before the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, the Wall Street Journal reported that \\"Today, 'way less than half' of all securities trade on exchanges with readily available price information, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Daniel Harris. More and more securities are priced by dealers who don't publish quotes. As a result, money managers can no longer gauge with certainty the value of some assets in mutual funds, hedge funds and other investment vehicles...\\"Susan Pulliam, Randall Smith and Michael Siconolf. \\"U.S. Investors Face An Age of Murky Pricing: Values of Securities Tougher to Pin Down.\\" Wall Street Journal, 12 October 2007, p. A 1. The reassurance of a self-balancing market does not matter much when people are making money, but when they do not, they become very concerned with market imbalances (mismatch of supply and demand). When the information needed to calculate prices is inadequate for any reason, it becomes susceptible to swindles, confidence tricks and fraudLaura Northrup, \\"90% Off An Imaginary Price Is Not A Sale.\\" The Consumerist, 5 April 2011. which may be difficult to detect or combat, insofar as the trading parties have to make assumptions in interpreting price information where any \\"misunderstanding\\" is their own responsibility. The risks and risk-bearers may not be fully specifiable. In this context, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states: This problem is compounded if various extrapolated ideal prices used to guide economic actors rely on observed trends in real prices which fluctuate a great deal in ways that are difficult to predict, and if the predictions made themselves influence price levels. It plays an important role in the theory of information asymmetry to which Joseph Stiglitz has made important contributions. Price information is likely to be reliable, *if market actors have a self-interest in providing true information, *if it is technically possible to obtain true and accurate information, and *if there are comprehensive legal sanctions (penalties) for false price information. But additionally, any market cannot function unless participants show trust and cooperation, and are motivated to do so.

In 1915, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army, and he later fought for Poland, reaching the rank of colonel. Upon the German invasion of Poland that triggered World War II in 1939, he escaped with his family to Romania, then France and finally England after France capitulated to Germany in June 1940. In later life he worked as a gardener in Scotland before moving to Cumbria with his daughter. He died at a nursing home, aged 111 years and 140 days, and was then Britain's oldest man. Biography PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski was born in Lw√≥w (present-day Lviv, Ukraine), the capital of what became the Austrian province of Galicia. Although technically part of Austria-Hungary, the Galician Polish enjoyed a \\"degree of autonomy in local government\\". He began studying law at Lemberg University in 1912, transferring to the University of Vienna two years later. =World War I= Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Galicians were subject to conscription, and PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski was called up. His training took place chiefly in Hungary and Bosnia. In 1916, he was sent as a sergeant to the Italian front in Montenegro and Albania. Although allied by treaty with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy had instead joined the war on the side of the Allied Powers in May 1915, in hopes of annexing parts of Austrian territory. In November 1918, he was taken prisoner in northern Italy during the last hours of the war. When he was freed the following Christmas, he was sent to France. Like many Galicians taken prisoner after being conscripted into the German Army, PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski volunteered to join the Polish Army Corps in France. This unit, which contained Polish-American volunteers, had seen action in 1918 in the allied campaign in Alsace-Lorraine, fostering an acute sense of Polish identity among the troops. =The Army of the Republic of Poland= When peace came, PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski elected to serve in the army of the newly proclaimed Republic of Poland guaranteed by the signatories to the Treaty of Versailles. He became a lieutenant and staff officer under General J√≥zef Haller in an infantry division, and took part in the 1920‚Äì21 Polish War against Soviet Russia. This was fought between the Red Army and Poland over Poland's eastern border. Following the Armistice in November, he was moved to the Polish 2nd Army, and two years later he became a captain. After marrying Maria Lewandowska in 1924, PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski was stationed in Przemy≈õl. In 1925, he became a major, and in 1930, he moved to Warsaw with his wife and young son. =World War II= At the outbreak of the Second World War, PajƒÖczkowski- Dydy≈Ñski was a lieutenant-colonel. He was at the headquarters of the Polish Army in Warsaw when, on 1 September 1939, 1.8 million German troops invaded Poland. His wife and son fled to Romania by means of an evacuation train. When surrender seemed inevitable, he escaped to Bucharest to collect his family. Along with 30,000 other Polish, he was able to make his way to France through then still-neutral Italy. When France fell to the Germans, PajƒÖczkowski- Dydy≈Ñski left for Britain, arriving in Plymouth on 28 June 1940. He stayed at military camps in ScotlandLanarkshire and Peebles, before being sent to Perth, where he took command of a Polish garrison. In 1943, he moved to Edinburgh, translating and adapting British military regulations and manuals for the use of Polish units. =Later life= When the war ended in May 1945, PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski made Edinburgh his home as Lw√≥w had been annexed by the Soviet Union. Following the death of his wife Maria that year, he married Dorothy Caterall; the couple had a daughter. PajƒÖczkowski-Dydy≈Ñski worked as a gardener. He was fluent in Polish, French, German and English. He had a passion for music and was a skilled viola player. In 1964, he was promoted to a full colonel. He did not return to Poland until 1989, when he was 95. He died in Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria in 2005, aged 111, survived by ten grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by both wives.

He signals that you can evade taxes and get away with it, pay the courts and get the judges to decide in your favour, get good lawyers and delay your cases. The messages that are given by the kind of treatment that he gets from the Government are the antithesis of what we need for sustainable development: an even playing field and Government intervention of the right kind.\\" [3] The Presidential Commission on Good Government (\\"PCGG\\") originally filed a case against Tan in July 1987, and has since amended it twice, the last time being on 5 September 1991. According to the PCGG, the state is entitled to PHP 50 billion in damages and PHP 1 billion in legal expenses.[4] In addition, the state was seeking to recover 60% of Tan's holdings in companies that Tan held in trust for the former president Marcos ‚Äì such as Fortune Tobacco, Asia Brewery, Allied Banking Corp., Foremost Farms, Himmel Industries, Grandspan Development Corp., Silangan Holdings, Dominium Realty and Construction Corp., and Shareholdings Inc. ‚Äì as the PCGG alleges that they were illegally acquired by Marcos using government funds. After filing the case in July 1987, the PCGG seized control of Tan‚Äôs companies, continuing to do so until 2006 when the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan nullified the writs of sequestration on Allied Banking Corp., Fortune Tobacco, Foremost Farms and Shareholdings Inc. The court ruled the writs had no basis as there was no prima facie proof that any of Tan‚Äôs assets were obtained illegally. The PCGG soon afterwards filed a petition to the Supreme Court. On December 7, 2007, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the anti-graft court. The Supreme Court found no proof that Tan, his family, or his various businesses took undue advantage of their relationship with former President Marcos. Finding no factual basis for the sequestration of the stocks, the Supreme Court denied the PCGG‚Äôs petition, according to a court statement. In an April 29, 2009 letter filed at the anti-graft court, the PCGG announced that it is \\"resting its case\\" and terminating its presentation of evidence in the PHP 51 billion lawsuit. This, the report said, came as a surprise as government lawyers had earlier insisted in court that they still have several key witnesses, including former First Lady Imelda Marcos.

The history of Ordnance Survey's spatial address information goes back to the 1840s when the first large-scale maps were published with names identifying prominent properties such as large landmark houses in a locality. In 1945, when Ordnance Survey had moved to the National Grid system, maps at 1:1250 and 1:2500 scales showed sufficient information to infer other individual addresses. The recording of address information in large-scale data has been ongoing ever since. Address Point, which was launched in the early 1990s, was the first address-specific product in digital form. The latest evolution of Ordnance Survey's spatial address data is OS MasterMap Address Layer 2. OS MasterMap Address Layer 2 offers significant enhancements such as classifications, building name aliases, geographical addresses, objects without a postal address, such as churches, and multiple occupancy information for flats and halls of residence where individual properties within do not have mail delivered to a letter box of their own. A free cross-reference table allows Ordnance Survey‚Äôs data to be linked with other key datasets, including the Valuation Office Agency‚Äôs Non Domestic Rates and Council Tax data. Accuracy of AddressPoint co-ordinates Each address is coordinated on the National Grid, with eastings and northings normally quoted to a resolution of 0.1 metres. The accuracy of each georeference is classified within the status flag, in which is indicated whether the coordinates are due to be improved (PQ1) or as good as they can be (PQ3). Resources are directed towards continually improving the proportion of records with the PQ3 classification.

Life He was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire1911 England CensusEngland, Oxford Men and Their Colleges, 1880-1892 but shortly thereafter his father, a successful merchant of ornamental ironwork, moved to a large property in London. William was his sole heir. He began to study medicine at University College London in 1880, but dropped out when he failed anatomy. Attracted to physiology, he studied under John Burdon Sanderson at Wadham College, Oxford, where he won a first class degree, investigating electrical changes occurring during salivary secretion. He returned to University College London in 1888 as an assistant to Edward Sharpey-Schafer. In 1890 he began to collaborate with Ernest Starling, who was at Guy's Hospital, on the electrical activity of the heart. They complemented one-another in many ways: for instance, Bayliss dealt with the recording apparatus while Starling worked with the preparation. Bayliss married Starling's sister Gertrude in 1893; they had three sons and one daughter. They enjoyed entertaining at their London estate, even hosting all those attending London meetings of the Physiological Society. He built a laboratory in a corrugated iron shed in his four-acre garden. He and Starling first studied pressures in the veins and capillaries, but in 1897 they radically changed direction to work on the control of the motility of the gut.Henderson 2005, pp. 46-49. Collaboration became easier when Starling moved to University College London as the Jodrell Chair of Physiology in 1899. It was known that injecting hydrochloric acid into the intestinal lumen evoked secretion by the pancreas; injection into the blood did not. They set out to determine which nerves were involved, but denervation did not block the response. In a flash of inspiration they ground up a sample of intestinal mucosa in sand containing hydrochloric acid; injecting the filtered extract elicited copious pancreatic secretion.Henderson 2005, pp.54-58. They called the responsible chemical secretin and named such messenger chemicals hormones. A \\"discovery must, as it seems to me, ever rank as one of the landmarks of physiology‚Äî-the discovery not merely of a new thing, but of a new process of life\\". In 1903 he was demonstrating to the medical students an experiment on an anesthetized dog. Two visiting Swedish ladies believed that the anesthesia was insufficient and reported this to Stephen Coleridge, secretary of the anti-vivisectionist, his charges of torture were widely reported in the newspapers. The wealthy Bayliss had the resources to demand an apology, and when this was denied to sue for libel. The trial in the Brown Dog affair filled the newspapers, the jury found for Bayliss. Bayliss then studied the circulation of the brain and the action of enzymes, he was a founder of the Biochemical Society. In 1912 a Professorship in General Physiology was created for him at University College London. During the first years of World War I Starling was in the army, so Bayliss taught physiology and served on the Royal Society Food (War) Committee. In 1916 he presented a paper on wound shock. It was known that in shock blood volume is decreased, even when the patient has not bled. This loss of blood causes the fall in blood pressure, because the heart has less blood to pump. This fall in blood pressure is responsible for the symptoms of shock. If blood volume is restored by injecting a salt solution then blood pressure rises, but only transitionally. Intravenous salt solutions had not helped men shocked during the Battle of the Somme. Using cats Bayliss demonstrated that if the salt solution contains five percent gelatin or gum arabic the rise in blood pressure is sustained and shock is alleviated. The explanation had been revealed earlier by Starling: molecules too large to escape from the blood plasma while it passes through the capillaries generate the osmotic pressure needed to pull fluid from the extracellular fluid back into the circulation (although Bayliss suggested they might act by increasing blood viscosity). In November 1917 gum-saline was infused into wound shocked men who recovered. However, it was March 1918 before gum-saline was shipped to the front. No record was kept of how many were treated. The Germans adopted gum-saline, also without recording their results. Bayliss summarized this work in a book. In 1919 he published Principles of General Physiology, which he defined as those processes common to all living things. This influential book was \\"a revelation of the personality of the writer.\\" It went through four editions and was revised after his death by his son Leonard and AV Hill, the fifth edition appearing in 1959-1960. An obituary noted that \\"His quiet generosity, his kindliness, his self-effacing modesty and his simple goodness endeared him to all his fellow physiologists\\" J. B. 1926, p. xxxii. Another pointed out that Bayliss loved to have young physiologists about him and they loved his company because \\"His knowledge, though exhaustive, was never overbearing, and his genius was never frightening probably because his mind did not work rapidly.\\" J.B. 1926, xxx Honours and awards Bayliss was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1903. He jointly delivered their Croonian lecture in 1904 and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1911 and their Copley Medal in 1919. He was knighted for his contribution to medicine in 1922. Death Bayliss died in London in 1924. The Bayliss and Starling Society was founded in 1979 as a forum for scientists with research interests in central and autonomic peptide function. Family His son, Dr Leonard Ernest Bayliss FRSE (1901-1964) was also a physiologist. who continued the family tradition of writing physiology textbooks.

Long considered to be the perfect word of God by devout Christians (and the Jewish parts by devout Jews), scholars and scientists have endeavored for centuries to scrutinise the texts to establish their origins (a related field of study known as biblical criticism) and validity. In addition to concerns about ethics in the Bible, biblical inerrancy, or the historicity of the Bible there remain some questions of authorship and what material should be included in the biblical canon. Authorship At the end of the 17th century only a few Bible scholars doubted that Moses wrote the Torah (also known as the Pentateuch, traditionally called the \\"Five Books of Moses\\"), such as Thomas Hobbes, Isaac La Peyr√®re and Baruch Spinoza, but in the late 18th century some scholars such as Jean Astruc (1753)Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Astruc, Jean\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. began to systematically question his authorship. By the end of the 19th century some such as Julius Wellhausen and Abraham KuenenEncarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Pentateuch. ¬ß2. Theorie van gesplitste bronnen\\". went as far as to claim that as a whole the work was of many more authors over many centuries from 1000 BC (the time of David) to 500 BC (the time of Ezra), and that the history it contained was often more polemical rather than strictly factual. By the first half of the 20th century Hermann Gunkel had drawn attention to mythic aspects, and Albrecht Alt, Martin Noth and the tradition history school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not intended as history in the modern sense. The modern historical consensus is that it is unknown who wrote most of the books of the Bible. Most of them are written anonymously, and only some of the 27 books of the New Testament mention an author, some of which are probably or known to be pseudepigrapha, meaning they were written by someone other than who the author said he was. The anonymous books have traditionally been attributed authors, though none of these, such as the \\"Five Books of Moses\\", or the four canonical gospels \\"according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\\" have appeared to stand up under scrutiny. Only the 7 undisputed Pauline epistles appear to have most likely been written by Paul the Apostle, the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos (not by John the Apostle, nor by the author(s) of the other 'Johannine literature'). Scholars disagree whether Paul wrote the \\"Deutero-Pauline epistles\\" and whether Simon Peter wrote First Epistle of Peter; all other New Testament books that mention an author are most likely forgeries. In the 2nd century, the gnostics often claimed that their form of Christianity was the first, and they regarded Jesus as a teacher, or allegory. Elaine Pagels has proposed that there are several examples of gnostic attitudes in the Pauline epistles. Bart D. Ehrman and Raymond E. Brown note that some of the Pauline epistles are widely regarded by scholars as pseudonymous, Scholars who hold to Pauline authorship include Wohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, Jeremais, Simpson, Kelly, and Fee. Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction, p. 622. and it is the view of Timothy Freke, and others, that this involved a forgery in an attempt by the Church to bring in Paul's gnostic supporters and turn the arguments in the other epistles on their head. Canonicity Specific collections of biblical writings, such as the Hebrew Bible and Christian Bibles, are considered sacred and authoritative by their respective faith groups.\\"Bible.\\" The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia. West Chiltington: Crystal Reference, 2005. Credo Reference. 29 July 2009 The limits of the canon were effectively set by the proto-orthodox churches from the 1st throughout the 4th century, however the status of the scriptures has been a topic of scholarly discussion in the later churches. Increasingly, the biblical works have been subjected to literary and historical criticism in an effort to interpret the biblical texts, independent of churches and dogmatic influences. In the middle of the second century, Marcion of Sinope proposed rejecting the entire Jewish Bible. He considered the God portrayed therein to be a lesser deity, a demiurge and that the law of Moses was contrived. Jews discount the New Testament and Old Testament deuterocanonicals, Jews and most Christians discredit the legitimacy of New Testament apocrypha, and a view sometimes referred to as Jesuism does not affirm the scriptural authority of any biblical text other than the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels.  Ethics  Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of philosophy and women's studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, states that \\"the Bible contains both good and evil teachings\\", and it is \\"morally inconsistent\\". Anderson criticizes commands God gave to men in the Old Testament, such as: kill adulterers, homosexuals, and \\"people who work on the Sabbath\\" (Leviticus 20:10; Leviticus 20:13; Exodus 35:2, respectively); to commit ethnic cleansing (Exodus 34:11‚Äì14, Leviticus 26:7‚Äì9); commit genocide (Numbers 21: 2‚Äì3, Numbers 21:33‚Äì35, Deuteronomy 2:26‚Äì35, and Joshua 1‚Äì12); and other mass killings. Anderson considers the Bible to permit slavery, the beating of slaves, the rape of female captives in wartime, polygamy (for men), the killing of prisoners, and child sacrifice. She also provides a number of examples to illustrate what she considers \\"God's moral character\\": \\"Routinely punishes people for the sins of others ... punishes all mothers by condemning them to painful childbirth\\", punishes four generations of descendants of those who worship other gods, kills 24,000 Israelites because some of them sinned (Numbers 25:1‚Äì9), kills 70,000 Israelites for the sin of David in 2 Samuel 24:10‚Äì15, and \\"sends two bears out of the woods to tear forty-two children to pieces\\" because they called someone names in 2 Kings 2:23‚Äì24. Anderson criticizes what she terms morally repugnant lessons of the New Testament. She claims that \\"Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin\\" (Matt 10:35‚Äì37), that \\"Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)\\", and that Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives \\"who must obey their husbands as gods\\" (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34‚Äì35, Eph. 5:22‚Äì24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11‚Äì12, 1 Pet. 3:1). Anderson states that the Gospel of John implies that \\"infants and anyone who never had the opportunity to hear about Christ are damned [to hell], through no fault of their own\\". Simon Blackburn states that the \\"Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women\\". Blackburn criticizes what he terms morally suspect themes of the New Testament. He notes some \\"moral quirks\\" of Jesus: that he could be \\"sectarian\\" (Matt 10:5‚Äì6),: \\"Then the persona of Jesus in the Gospels has his fair share of moral quirks. He can be sectarian: 'Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' (Matt. 10:5‚Äì6).\\" racist (Matt 15:26 and Mark 7:27), and placed no value on animal life (Luke 8: 27‚Äì33). Blackburn provides examples of Old Testament moral criticisms, such as the phrase in Exodus 22:18, (\\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\\") which he says has \\"helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America\\". He states that the Old Testament God apparently has \\"no problems with a slave- owning society\\", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and \\"is keen on child abuse\\". Additional examples that are questioned today are: the prohibition on touching women during their \\"period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19‚Äì24)\\", the apparent approval of selling daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:7), and the obligation to put to death someone working on the Sabbath (Exodus 35:2). Historicity The historicity of the Bible is the question of the Bible's \\"acceptability as a history\\". This can be extended to the question of the Christian New Testament as an accurate record of the historical Jesus and the Apostolic Age. Scholars examine the historical context of the Bible passages, the importance ascribed to events by the authors, and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and other historical evidence. Archaeological discoveries since the 19th century are open to interpretation, but broadly speaking they lend support to few of the Old Testament's narratives as history and offer evidence to challenge others.}} }} Biblical minimalism is a label applied to a loosely knit group of scholars who hold that the Bible's version of history is not supported by any archaeological evidence so far unearthed, thus the Bible cannot be trusted as a history source. Critics of the authenticity of the New Testament such as Richard Carrier and Paul N. Tobin argue that pseudepigrapha within the New Testament invalidates it as a reliable source of information. Author Richard I. Pervo details the non-historical sources of the Book of Acts.  Internal consistency  There are many places in the Bible in which inconsistencies‚Äîsuch as different numbers and names for the same feature, and different sequences for the same events‚Äîhave been alleged and presented by critics as difficulties. Responses to these criticisms include the modern documentary hypothesis, the two-source hypothesis and theories that the pastoral epistles are pseudonymous.Knight, George William, Howard Marshall, and W. Ward Gasque. The Pastoral Epistles: A Commentary on the Greek Text (New International Greek Testament Commentary). William. B. Eerdmans, 1997. / 9780802823953 However, authors such as Raymond Brown have presented arguments that the Gospels actually contradict each other in various important respects and on various important details. W. D. Davies and E. P. Sanders state that: \\"on many points, especially about Jesus' early life, the evangelists were ignorant ‚Ä¶ they simply did not know, and, guided by rumour, hope or supposition, did the best they could\\".W.D Davies and E. P. Sanders, 'Jesus from the Jewish point of view', in The Cambridge History of Judaism ed William Horbury, vol 3: the Early Roman Period, 1984. More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts, or at least constructed from traditions that predate the Gospels. For example, many versions of the Bible specifically point out that the most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses did not include , i.e., the Gospel of Mark originally ended at Mark 16:8, and additional verses were added a few hundred years later. This is known as the \\"Markan Appendix\\".The Continuing Christian Need for Judaism, by John Shelby Spong, Christian Century September 26, 1979, p. 918. see http://www.religion- online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1256 Mythology The validity of the Gospels is challenged by writers such as Kersey Graves who claimed that mythic stories, that have parallels in the life of Jesus, support the conclusion that the gospel writers incorporated them into the story of Jesus and Gerald Massey, who specifically claimed that the life story of the Egyptian god Horus was copied by Christian Gnostics. Parallels have also been drawn between Greek myths and the life of Jesus. The comparative mythology of Jesus Christ examines the parallels that have been proposed for the Biblical portrayal of Jesus in comparison to other religious or mythical domains. Some critics have alleged that Christianity is not founded on a historical figure, but rather on a mythical creation. One of these views proposes that Jesus was the Jewish manifestation of a pan-Hellenic cult, known as Osiris-Dionysus.Freke, Timothy and Gandy, Peter (1999) The Jesus Mysteries. London: Thorsons (Harper Collins) Christ myth theory proponents claim that the age, authorship, and authenticity of the Gospels can not be verified, thus the Gospels can not bear witness to the historicity of Jesus. This is in contrast with writers such as David Strauss, who regarded only the supernatural elements of the gospels as myth, but whereas these supernatural myths were a point of contention, there was no refutation of the gospels authenticity as witness to the historicity of Jesus. Critics of the Gospels such as Richard Dawkins and Thomas Henry Huxley note that they were written long after the death of Jesus and that we have no real knowledge of the date of composition of the Gospels. Annie Besant and Thomas Paine note that the authors of the Gospels are not known.  Translation issues  Translation of scripture into the vernacular (such as English and hundreds of other languages), though a common phenomenon, is also a subject of debate and criticism.\\"Bible.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Credo Reference. 29 July 2009 For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because many of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over correct interpretation occur. For instance, at creation (), is ◊®◊ï◊ó ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù (ruach 'elohiym) the \\"wind of god\\", \\"spirit of god\\"(i.e., the Holy Spirit in Christianity), or a \\"mighty wind\\" over the primordial deep? In Hebrew, ◊®◊ï◊ó (ruach) can mean \\"wind\\",\\"breath\\" or \\"spirit\\". Both ancient and modern translators are divided over this and many other such ambiguities.The Bible in the Syriac tradition, Sebastian P. Brock, p. 13Understanding Biblical Israel: a reexamination of the origins of monotheism, Stanley Ned RosenbaumThe Jewish religion: a companion By Louis Jacobs, p. 251 Another example is the word used in the Masoretic Text to indicate the woman who would bear Immanuel is alleged to mean a young, unmarried woman in Hebrew, while follows the Septuagint version of the passage that uses the Greek word parthenos, translated virgin, and is used to support the Christian idea of virgin birth. Those who view the Masoretic Text, which forms the basis of most English translations of the Old Testament, as being more accurate than the Septuagint, and trust its usual translation, may see this as an inconsistency, whereas those who take the Septuagint to be accurate may not. More recently, several discoveries of ancient manuscripts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Codex Sinaiticus, have led to modern translations like the New International Version differing somewhat from the older ones such as the 17th century King James Version, removing verses not present in the earliest manuscripts (see List of omitted Bible verses), some of which are acknowledged as interpolations, such as the Comma Johanneum, others having several highly variant versions in very important places, such as the resurrection scene in Mark 16. The King-James-Only Movement rejects these changes and uphold the King James Version as the most accurate.Eric Pement, Gimme the Bible that Paul used: A look at the King James Only debate online .  The Bible and science  =Origins= A common point of criticism against the Bible is the Genesis creation narrative, Genesis flood myth, and the Tower of Babel. According to young Earth creationism, flat earth theory, and geocentrism, which takes a literal view of the book of Genesis, the universe and all forms of life on Earth were created directly by God sometime between 5,700 and 10,000 years ago. This assertion is contradicted by biology, physics, chemistry, geoscience, astronomy, and archaeology. For instance, astrophysical evidence suggests that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old. Moreover, 10,000 years is not enough time to account for the current amount of genetic variation in humans. If all humans were descended from two individuals that lived less than 10,000 years ago, it would require an impossibly high rate of mutation to reach humanity's current level of genetic diversity. The BioLogos Foundation has sought to reconcile these scientific challenges with the Christian faith. =Archaeology= According to one of the world's leading biblical archaeologists, William G. Dever, > Archaeology certainly doesn't prove literal readings of the Bible...It calls > them into question, and that's what bothers some people. Most people really > think that archaeology is out there to prove the Bible. No archaeologist > thinks so. [...] From the beginnings of what we call biblical archeology, > perhaps 150 years ago, scholars, mostly western scholars, have attempted to > use archeological data to prove the Bible.

The truth of the matter today is that > archeology raises more questions about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible > and even the New Testament than it provides answers, and that's very > disturbing to some people.The Bible's Buried Secrets, PBS Nova, 2008 Dever also wrote: According to Dever, the scholarly consensus is that the figure of Moses is legendary, and not historical.William G. Dever \\"What Remains of the House That Albright Built?\\", in George Ernest Wright, Frank Moore Cross, Edward Fay Campbell, Floyd Vivian Filson (eds.) The Biblical Archaeologist, American Schools of Oriental Research, Scholars Press, Vol. 56, No. 1, 2 March 1993, pp. 25‚Äì35, p. 33: \\"the overwhelming scholarly consensus today is that Moses is a mythical figure.\\" However, he states that a \\"Moses- like figure\\" may have existed somewhere in the southern Transjordan in the mid-13th century BC. Tel Aviv University archaeologist Ze'ev Herzog wrote in the Haaretz newspaper: Israel Finkelstein told The Jerusalem Post that Jewish archaeologists have found no historical or archaeological evidence to back the biblical narrative of the Exodus, the Jews' wandering in Sinai or Joshua's conquest of Canaan. On the alleged Temple of Solomon, Finkelstein said that there is no archaeological evidence to prove it really existed. Professor Yoni Mizrahi, an independent archaeologist who has worked with the International Atomic Energy Agency, agreed with Finkelstein.

Background Laura Norberg had severe pains in her jaw and frequent headaches in 1978. To remedy this problem, her sister offered her Fiorinal. After the source of her pain, an abscessed tooth, was found and treated, her addiction to painkillers remained. After breaking her ankle in 1981, she found a doctor who would prescribe Fiorinal. After this doctor retired, she sought out another who would provide the drug. Starting in 1982, she began seeing Dr. Wynrib, an elderly physician, and he began giving Norberg Fiorinal under the pretext of an ankle injury. In exchange, Wynrib demanded sexual favours. She eventually brought an action against him for sexual assault. Issues There are two main issues in this case. First, the sexual assault falls under the tort of battery. Second, can the relationship between Norberg and Wynrib be characterized as fiduciary and therefore give rise to a fiduciary obligation? The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the case on the basis that she consented. The case was given leave to the Supreme Court. The Women's Legal Education and Action Fund acted as an intervener in this case. Decision Writing for the majority, La Forest J found an award of punitive damages on behalf of Norberg, but stops short of recognizing a fiduciary duty. The majority does not believe that sex is a power that can be transferred. Even though the majority discusses consent and its vitiation, they still treat the facts as an exchange between two parties. Concurring in the result, McLachlin J (as she then was) characterized the duty differently: :The relationship of physician and patient can be conceptualized in a variety of ways. It can be viewed as a creature of contract, with the physician's failure to fulfil his or her obligations giving rise to an action for breach of contract. It undoubtedly gives rise to a duty of care, the breach of which constitutes the tort of negligence. In common with all members of society, the doctor owes the patient a duty not to touch him or her without his or her consent; if the doctor breaches this duty, he or she will have committed the tort of battery. But perhaps the most fundamental characteristic of the doctor-patient relationship is its fiduciary nature. All the authorities agree that the relationship of physician to patient also falls into that special category of relationships which the law calls fiduciary.p 270‚Äì71 [cited to SCR] See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court) * Fiduciary Duty Notes External links * full text from Supreme Court Reports * intervener application Category:Canadian tort case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1992 in Canadian case law ","title":"Norberg v Wynrib"},{"id":"3386080","text":"George Siao Kian Ty ( 18 October 1932 ‚Äì 23 November 2018) was a Filipino banker and business magnate.

In d spacetime dimensions, Amag is a (d-3)-form and so the 't Hooft operator is the integral of Amag over a (d-3)-dimensional surface. Disorder operator While the Wilson loop is an order operator, the 't Hooft operator is an example of a disorder operator because it creates a singularity or a discontinuity in the fundamental fields such as the electromagnetic potential A. For example, in an SU(N) Yang Mills gauge theory a 't Hooft operator creates a Dirac magnetic monopole with respect to the center of SU(N). If a condensate is present which transforms in a representation of SU(N) which is invariant under the action of the center, such as the adjoint representation, then the magnetic monopole will be confined by a vortex lying along a Dirac string from the monopole to either an antimonopole or to infinity. This vortex is similar to a Nielsen- Olesen vortex, but it carries a charge under the center of SU(N), and so N such vortices may annihilate. In his 1978 paper, 't Hooft demonstrated that Wilson loops and 't Hooft operators commute up to a phase which is an n-th root of unity. The choice of root of unity is related to the linking number of the Wilson loop and the vortex. 't Hooft claimed that this apparently non- local commutation relation implies that any phase of a Yang-Mills gauge theory must either contain massless particles, responsible for the interactions between the 't Hooft operator and the Wilson loop, or else at least one of the two operators must be confined by an object one dimension higher. He identified the phase in which the 't Hooft operator is confined as the Higgs phase, in which the confinement of magnetic monopoles by vortices was a well- known consequence of the Meissner effect, already observed in type II superconductors. He identified the phase in which the Wilson loop is confined as the confining phase, as a Wilson loop is the action of an electric charge. Finally he left open the possibility of mixed phases, in which both are confined. Although such mixed phases had not been seen in quantum field theory at the time, they are now know to occur for example in the Argyres-Douglas conformal field theory. Therefore, he argued that gauge theories are necessarily in one of these four possible phases. 't Hooft found a simple formula for the scalings of the Wilson and 't Hooft operators in the various phases. When a given operator is confined, a finite tension surface is created whose boundary is the operator. The action of the configuration, in the limit in which the configuration is large, therefore scales with the volume of this surface. In the confining phase the Wilson loops are confined by a 2-dimensional surface, and so the action of a Wilson loop scales as the area of this surface. In the Higgs phase the (d-3)-dimensional 't Hooft operator is confined, and so the action scales as the area of the (d-2)-dimensional confining surface. For example, in the confining phase in 4 space-time dimensions the action of the 't Hooft operator scales as the distance squared. In the mixed phase both operators are confined, and so both obey this scaling. On the other hand, he claimed that if a given operator is Higgsed, then the corresponding gluons are massive and so the action falls off exponentially away from the operator. Therefore, the action will be proportional to volume of the surface on which the operator is evaluated itself. For example, in the Higgs phase the gauge field is Higgsed and so the Wilson loop action is proportional to the length of the loop, which scales linearly with distance. In the confining phase the 't Hooft operator is Higgsed, and so the corresponding action fails as the area of the corresponding (d-3)-dimensional surface, for example linearly in 4 spacetime dimensions. In particular 't Hooft concluded that in 4 dimensions if both the actions of the Wilson and 't Hooft loops scale linearly then both are Higgsed and so there must be massless particles in the spectrum. Today 't Hooft's classication of phases is the bases of the classification of QCD phase diagram, with the Higgs phase manifested at the cold temperatures and low densities usually found on Earth, massless particles and deconfinment existing at high temperature experiments at RHIC and soon the LHC and perhaps mixed phases existing in the cores of neutron stars. In 2009, a study by J. Gomis et al., concluded the 't Hooft operator exactly reproduces the results of the dual Wilson loop, proving the predictions.\\"Research by J.

After graduation, he took up the study of horticulture. Attention was first called to his work in 1795 by the publication of the results of his research into the propagation of fruit trees and the diseases prevalent among them. He used of land he inherited to conduct breeding of plants including strawberries, cabbages and peas and built an extensive greenhouse. In 1797 he published his Treatise on the Culture of the Apple and Pear, and on the Manufacture of Cider and Perry, a work which passed through several editions. He was one of the leading students of horticulture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but his personal papers disappeared after his death. Knight performed basic physiological experiments on plants, which work had been performed before only rarely. He elucidated the effects of gravity on seedlings and how decay in fruit trees was passed on by grafting. In many respects his work looked back to that of Rev. Stephen Hales. His goals were always strictly practical, aiming to improve useful food plants by breeding for better qualities. In the mid-19th century, the Downton strawberry was a popular strawberry in Britain, until it was eclipsed by modern strawberry hybrids at the turn of the century. It is not widely known that he studied variation in peas and found many of the same results as Mendel, but he failed to make the same imaginative leap about how these changes took place.Zirkle, Conway. (1951). Gregor Mendel & His Precursors. Isis. Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 97‚Äì104. Knight intentionally shut himself off from outside scientific influences. He refused to read anyone else's scientific papers until Sir Joseph Banks, with whom he had a voluminous correspondence, persuaded him to do so. Knight reported on all his work in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London. From 1811 to 1838 Knight was president of the London Horticultural Society, founded in 1804. Banks, president of the Royal Society, had recognised Knight's contributions to science and prevailed upon him to join the Horticultural Society, as it was then known. After the death of the first president, George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, Banks proposed Knight to be president. In 1864 the Society received a royal patent from Albert, Prince Consort, which permitted it to be known thenceforth as the Royal Horticultural Society. Banks called upon Knight to write a \\"prospectus\\" for the society (what would now be called a mission statement), outlining its functions and purpose. Younger members of the Society were inspired by his example. Men such as Thomas Laxton carried on his principles of careful observation and practical goals. Laxton left as his legacy improved varieties of apples, peas and sweet peas among many others, together with a thriving seed business. Marriage and progeny He married Frances Felton, a daughter of Humphry Felton of Woodhall in Shropshire, by whom he had progeny as follows:Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed.

Most of its contents are covered by commercial in confidence requirements. The general outcome of the MSA, however, is the supply of geographic data to local authorities and the defining of licensing issues regarding address data. The MSA replaced an existing agreement for the supply of geographic data between local authorities, police, fire and other emergency services, and the national mapping agency, Ordnance Survey (OS). It also complied with European Union rules on procurement. As a result, suppliers of geographic information had to go through a process of open procurement managed on behalf of local authorities by the IDeA, an umbrella government organisation coordinating and promoting local authority good practice. The result was that three suppliers were selected: Ordnance Survey, Intermap and Intelligent Addressing. For local authorities this meant little change in the supply of mapping data which continued to be supplied by OS. Intermap, however, supplied height data not previously covered by other arrangements. Perhaps the most significant outcome of the MSA is the resolution of ownership, licensing and royalty issues that had existed between local authorities and OS. In the agreement the address databases (called Local Land and Property Gazetteers ‚Äì LLPG) maintained by local authorities acknowledged the partial input of OS's address product, Address Point to these databases. In effect local authorities became \\"value added resellers\\" of ADDRESS-POINT and are required to pay OS royalties for the proportion of their use of the OS product. The agreement also puts into place funding for the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG), the UK's national address infrastructure, which is made up of the LLPGs compiled by local authorities. It also enables the NLPG to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs and thus ensure the nationwide coverage and compliance by local authorities. The Mapping Services Agreement contract expired on 31 March 2012 and was replaced by the Data Co-operation Agreement.

Background and career Brevoort was born in Yonkers, New York to a prosperous family with a history of involvement in the arts and architecture. He spent his childhood in what is now The Bronx, which in Brevoort's time was mainly rural. Continuing in the family tradition, Brevoort initiated his study of architecture in 1850 with his cousin, James Renwick, Jr., designer of St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. He gained a certificate in architecture from New York University in 1854, but at some point in the 1850s his interest shifted to traditional painting. Brevoort exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1856 and was elected an associate member there in 1861. Brevoort's landscapes during the 1850s and 1860s exhibit the stylistic trademarks of the Hudson River School: scenic views of realism and detail, with an emphasis on light. His favorite subjects were the hills, fields, and rivers of Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York, and the Farmington River in Connecticut, though he did travel farther afield to capture the mountainous and coastal terrain of New England. A number of his paintings are much wider than tall, which allowed Brevoort to emphasize the more tranquil, horizontal aspects of a scene in the manner of the late Hudson River School. In 1861, Brevoort was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1863. 1873 marked a turning point in Brevoort's career. Following the death of his first wife, he married Marie Louise Bascom, a talented artist and exhibitor at the National Academy School. He also auctioned off the entire contents of his studio‚Äîover 150 landscapes, including works he obtained from fellow artists Alexander Helwig Wyant, William Hart, Jervis McEntee and George Inness. Then Brevoort and his new wife left for Europe. Brevoort based himself in Florence, Italy with other American artists, but traveled extensively through Europe. Like most artists of the time he avidly sketched the scenes and people he encountered, gathering material for new paintings. He also undoubtedly attended exhibitions of European artists. Brevoort may have been exposed to the Barbizon school of landscape during this period. Returning to America in 1880 after his long absence, Brevoort's style began to change. His works became darker and more loosely painted, with an emphasis on mood and shadow, in the spirit of the Barbizon school‚Äîan artistic evolution that mirrored the general trend in American art as the Hudson River School declined in popularity. He also painted in watercolor, a medium that his good friend and fellow artist Samuel Colman had championed in America. Brevoort made his home in Yonkers, New York, and continued painting into the 1910s, having long since abandoned the Hudson River School style. He helped found the Yonkers Art Association in his final years. Brevoort died at home in 1918. Today, relative to other Hudson River School artists of his time, the works of James Renwick Brevoort are lesser-known. However, the combination of technical ability and artistry he exhibited at the height of his Hudson River School period have come to be regarded as among the finest examples in that phase of American landscape painting. Two major American museums, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, acquired similar seascapes by Brevoort in 2003 and 2004, respectively, for their permanent collections. The Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York, owns an extensive collection of Brevoort's paintings and drawings. A portrait of Brevoort by Henry Augustus Loop is in the collection of the National Academy of Design.

Upon its completion, it will have a length of , with a radius of approximately from the geographical center of the city. It was named after M√°rio Covas, who was mayor of the city of S√£o Paulo (1983‚Äì1985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer. It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of under normal weather and traffic circumstances.  History  The first section was inaugurated in October 2002, starting at the Estrada Velha de Campinas (lit. Old Road of Campinas), in the northern part of S√£o Paulo, and ending at the R√©gis Bittencourt highway, in Embu, covering . It crosses Anhang√ºera, Bandeirantes, Castelo Branco, and Raposo Tavares highways. There are urban accesses to the cities of Osasco and Carapicu√≠ba, but it also crosses through the municipalities of Barueri, Santana de Parna√≠ba, Embu, Cotia, and S√£o Paulo. The current segment has three tunnels, one of them being the largest and widest one in Brazil, with , 62 viaducts and six bridges. On September 15, 2006, the State Government announced the start of the construction of the South Segment, which would link the west segment to the Anchieta and Imigrantes highways and ending in Papa Jo√£o XXIII Avenue in Mau√°. It would serve as a corridor for more than 250,000 trucks per month which must go through the city of S√£o Paulo in order to interconnect to or from the city port of Santos, which is accessible via the two highways cited above. During the construction, a major accident happened when three recently installed ledges fell on the R√©gis Bittencourt highway, hitting three cars and injuring three people. The construction was expected to take almost five years, mainly due to the complex urban zones and difficult terrain it would cross (including a series of artificial lakes and dams and a mountainous region), but it ended up being inaugurated in April 2010, although some sections were missing guard rails and proper traffic signs. Upon its completion, estimated for 2022, it will have interconnected the Fern√£o Dias (in the North Segment), Presidente Dutra (opened in 2015) and Ayrton Senna (opened in 2015) East Segment main highways, besides many other smaller ones. Importance The S√£o Paulo Beltway is considered a major strategic investment for the efficiency of road transportation in the economically most important region of the country. S√£o Paulo is a megacity, with a population in excess of 20 million inhabitants, and more than 6 million vehicles. Most of the cargo transported by road or other modalities back and forth from the port of Santos today pass through the city of S√£o Paulo generating incredible traffic jams at all hours of the day, with a loss of more than 1.7 billion hours per year (more than 25 million trips a day). Although the city already has an inner beltway (called the Marginals, see Marginal Pinheiros and Marginal Tiet√™), it is over 30 years old and its capacity is completely saturated since (up until the construction of the Rodoanel) it is the only connection between the major highways around the city of S√£o Paulo. It has been estimated already that more than 30% of the Marginal's traffic was relieved as a consequence. A recent study, however, has shown that the impact of the Rodoanel in the traffic of S√£o Paulo will quickly diminish, since the number of new cars sold in the city breaks records successively and will quickly compensate for the absence of trucks in the city. The importance of the Beltway is underlined by popular approval, with June 2004 showing 85% approval rates, 86% of users deeming it a very important resource, and 80% of positive aspects. More than 300,000 vehicles (78% of them automobiles) use the Beltway every day. The system has an estimated peak capacity of 700,000 vehicles per day. Management The Western section, completed in 2002, is a toll road managed by a private group called CCR. The Southern section (opened in 2010) is managed by SEMPER, who won the public tender to manage, collect tolls and also to build and collect tolls on the recently finished Eastern section.  Tolls  CCR RodoAnel has 13 toll plazas installed by the extension of the western section of the M√°rio Covas ring road, and the collection of the fare is only carried out once every trip at the exits of the highway. The values are adjusted annually in July based on the variation of the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), as established in a contract with the Government of the State of S√£o Paulo. The payment of the toll is reversed in investment in works on the roads and the collection of taxes on the tariff is destined to the municipalities cut by the highway. In 2012, CCR RodoAnel made a transfer of R $ 9 million to the 7 municipalities through which the highway passes.

In 1931 Ernst Stromer named Carcharodontosauridae as a family, which, in modern paleontology, indicates a clade within Carnosauria. Carcharodontosaurids include some of the largest land predators ever known: Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Tyrannotitan all rivaled or possibly slightly exceeded Tyrannosaurus in length. A 2015 paper by Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues gives a maximum length estimate of for the largest carcharodontosaurids, while the smallest carcharodontosaurids were estimated to have been at least long. Evolution Restoration of the crushed skull of Concavenator Along with the spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurids were the largest predators in the early and middle Cretaceous throughout Gondwana, with species also present in North America (Acrocanthosaurus), Europe (Concavenator) and Asia (Shaochilong). Carcharodontosaurids range throughout the Cretaceous from the Barremian (127-121 million years ago) to the Turonian (93-89 million years ago). Past the Turonian, they might have been replaced by the smaller abelisaurids in Gondwana and by tyrannosaurids in North America and Asia. According to Fernando Novas and colleagues, the disappearance of not only carcharodontosaurids but also spinosaurids and other fauna in both Gondwana and North America seem to indicate that this faunal replacement occurred on a global scale.Novas, de Valais, Vickers-Rich, and Rich. (2005). \\"A large Cretaceous theropod from Patagonia, Argentina, and the evolution of carcharodontosaurids.\\" Naturwissenschaften, While some teeth and a maxilla discovered in Maastrichtian deposits of Brazil have been assigned to carcharodontosaurids, possibly extending their range, this identification has been subsequently rejected and the material assigned to abelisaurids after better examination. In December 2011, Oliver W. M. Rauhut described a new genus and species of carcharodontosaurid from the Late Jurassic (late Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian faunal stage, about 154-150 million years ago) of Tendaguru Formation, southeastern Tanzania. This genus, Veterupristisaurus represents the oldest known carcharodontosaurid. Classification The family Carcharodontosauridae was originally named by Ernst Stromer in 1931 to include the single newly discovered species Carcharodontosaurus saharicus. A close relative of C. saharicus, Giganotosaurus, was added to the family when it was described in 1995. Additionally, many paleontologists have included Acrocanthosaurus in this family (Sereno et al. 1996, Harris 1998, Holtz 2000, Rauhut 2003, Eddy & Clarke, 2011, Rauhut 2011), though others place it in the related family Allosauridae (Currie & Carpenter, 2000; Coria & Currie, 2002). Carcharodontosaurids are characterized by the following morphological characters : Dorsoventral depth of anterior maxillary interdental plates more than twice anteroposterior width, squared, sub-rectangular anterior portion of the dentary, teeth with wrinkled enamel surfaces, presence of four premaxillary alveoli and a premaxillary body taller than long in lateral aspect, opisthocoelous cervical vertebrae with neural spines more than 1.9 times the height of the centrum, large, textured rugosities on the lacrimal and postorbital formed by roofing and forming broad orbital shelves, and a proximomedially inclined femoral head. With the discovery of Mapusaurus in 2006, Rodolfo Coria and Phil Currie erected a subfamily of Carcharodontosauridae, the Giganotosaurinae, to contain the most advanced South American species, which they found to be more closely related to each other than to the African and European forms. Coria and Currie did not formally refer Tyrannotitan to this subfamily, pending a more detailed description of that genus, but noted that based on characteristics of the femur, it may be a gigantosaurin as well. Size comparison of seven carcharodontosaurids In 1998 Paul Sereno defined Carcharodontosauridae as a clade, consisting of Carcharodontosaurus and all species closer to it than to either Allosaurus, Sinraptor, Monolophosaurus, or Cryolophosaurus. Therefore, this clade is by definition outside of the clade Allosauridae. The cladogram below follows the analysis of Brusatte et al., 2009. Cladogram after Ortega et al., 2010 Cladogram after Novas et al., 2013 Mounted Acrocanthosaurus skeleton (NCSM 14345) at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The placement of Acrocanthosaurus is unclear, with most researchers favoring Carcharodontosauridae and others favoring Allosauridae. In 2011, a redescription of Kelmayisaurus by Stephen L. Brusatte, Roger B. J. Benson and Xing Xu found it to be valid genus of Carcharodontosauridae. A phylogenetic analysis of Tetanurae recovered K. petrolicus as a basal carcharodontosaurid in a trichotomy with Eocarcharia and a clade comprising more derived carcharodontosaurids. Bahariasaurus has also been proposed as a carcharodontosaurid, but its remains are too scarce to be certain. Carcharodontosaurids have been proposed as more closely related to abelisaurids, as opposed to the allosaurids. This is due to these two clades sharing some cranial features. However, these similarities appear to derive from parallel evolution between these two groups. A larger number of cranial and postcranial characters support their relationship with allosaurids.

Professional career De Vlaeminck missed 1967 only because his bike was damaged during the race. He also became Belgian champion four times (1967, 1969, 1971, 1972) at a time when there were so many good Belgian riders that the domestic championship was often harder than the world-championship. He also performed creditably in road races, including the Tour de France. In 1969 he won the Tour of Belgium and a stage in the Tour de France. De Vlaeminck never failed a drugs test in his racing career but was treated after it for amphetamine addiction. Many stories circulate about his supposed wild behaviour after races and after his career was over. When he returned to racing, the Belgian federation would offer him a licence for only a day at a time until it saw how his life would progress. De Vlaeminck subsequently refused to speak about this period of his life. His re-establishment was complete, however, because he became the national cyclo-cross coach and led Belgium to a dominating period of international success. He always complained, however, that while cyclo- cross brought Belgium its world championship medals, it was to road racing that the bulk of the funds were given. Personal life De Vlaeminck was the brother of Roger De Vlaeminck. His son Geert died of a heart attack in a cyclo-cross race while his father was watching. In later life, De Vlaeminck had Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. He died on 4 December 2015 at the age of 70.

A skilled excavator operator, his musical career began in the former East Germany, where he became known for his clever, often melancholic lyrics imbued with social commentary. After German reunification, he became especially popular among former East Germans who felt alienated and marginalized in the reunited country.  Career  Born in Weimar, Gundermann moved with his family to Hoyerswerda in 1967. After completing his secondary education, he studied for a year at the military academy in L√∂bau, but was expelled in 1975, after which he was forced to seek work in the coal mining area of the Spreetal (in today's Saxony). In 1976 he began evening school, and was recruited by the East German domestic intelligence service, the Stasi (codename \\"Grigori\\"). In 1977 he applied to join the ruling party, the SED, but was asked to leave the following year (after uttering contrary opinions), although this was reduced to a \\"strong rebuke\\" after he appealed. In 1983 he married Conny. The following year he was again expelled from the party and also from the Stasi. Gundermann's first appearances as a singer-songwriter came in 1986, and a year later he won the grand prize and a recording contract in the East German national song contest. His first LP M√§nner, Frauen und Maschinen (Men, Women, and Machines) appeared in 1988, but in contrast to his solo acoustic performances it was a rock record album with a backing band, with uptempo numbers like \\"Halte durch\\" (\\"Hang in there!\\"). It included an song of praise for his hometown Hoyerswerda, \\"Hoy Woy.\\" After the Fall of the Wall, Gundermann ran unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat in the Volkskammer in the March 1990 elections as a candidate for the leftist alliance Aktionsb√ºndnis Vereinigte Linke. Gundermann lived an ascetic lifestyle, eschewing alcohol, drugs, and smoking, and was a committed vegetarian. However, he was a workaholic; besides a full recording and performing schedule, Gundermann continued to work operating a rotary excavator, digging up seams of brown coal. He was worried that his music would lose its authenticity if it became his sole way of life. Perhaps because of overwork exhaustion, Gundermann died of an apoplexy on June 21, 1998, at the age of 43 at his home in Spreetal. He left behind a wife and four children. His decease followed that of his friend and co-musician Tamara Danz, also gone at an age of 43 years, by less than two years. In 2018, a biographical movie by director Andreas Dresen, Gundermann. Gundermann was personated by actor Alexander Scheer. The biographical film feature film was awarded six German Movie Awards (Deutscher Filmpreis) in 2019 of 10 nominations, among them the \\"German Oscars\\" for the Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Screenplay (Laila Stieler) and Best Director.

For centuries this location was used to offload seagoing ships, and led to the growth of Port Glasgow close to the castle on either side and to the south. When dredging techniques made the Clyde navigable as far as Glasgow the port became a shipbuilding centre, and the castle was surrounded by shipyards. Ferguson Shipbuilders, the last shipyard on the lower Clyde, stands close to the west of the castle, but the shipyards to the east were removed around the 1980s and new landscaped areas formed to the east of Newark Castle, opening up scenic views of the castle and across the Clyde from a new bypass road. History The castle was built in 1478 by George Maxwell when he inherited the Barony of Finlanstone (Finlaystone) in the parish of Kilmacolm. The original castle had a tower house within a walled enclosure or barmkin entered through a large gatehouse. All that remains of the outer defensive wall is from one of the original corner towers. It is thought that there would have been a hall and ancillary buildings such as a bakehouse and brew house inside the walled enclosure. =Renaissance mansion= In the late 16th century the castle was inherited by Sir Patrick Maxwell, a powerful friend of king James VI of Scotland and who was notorious for murdering two members of a rival family and beating his wife who left him after having 16 children. In 1597 Sir Patrick expanded the building, constructing a new north range replacing the earlier hall in the form of a three storey Renaissance mansion. At this time the barmkin wall was demolished except for the north east tower, which was converted into a doocot. During these years, Maxwell was a feud with a neighbour Robert Montgomerie of Skelmorlie.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 474. The central part of the mansion has cellars with tiny windows under a main hall with large windows, and other accommodation above that. An east wing with the main entrance door close to the main block links it to the original tower house which was suitably modified, and a short west wing connects to the gatehouse. The mansion has features of the Scottish baronial style including crow-stepped gables and north corners embellished with corbelled turrets. At the centre of its north wall a stairwell supported out on corbelling gives access to the upper floor. In 1668 the Glasgow authorities purchased 18 acres (7 hectares) of land around Newark Castle from Sir George Maxwell who was then the laird, and developed the harbour into what they called \\"Port Glasgow\\". The last Maxwell died in 1694 and the castle had a series of non-resident owners. An early tenant was a ropemaker called John Orr who also dealt in wild animals such as big cats and bears which he obtained from ships visiting the Clyde and often housed in the castle cellars. The cellars and gardens were later rented by Charles Williamson who blocked access from the hall to stop the joiner John Gardner who rented the hall from stealing fruit stored in the cellars. John Smith in 1895 records that the stump of the dule tree were carefully preserved in the castle grounds.Smith, John (1895) Prehistoric man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. London. P. 182.

The state park features approximately 50 waterfalls, some with up to drops. The park is used for hiking, bird watching, and geocaching. History Waterfall at Clark Creek Natural Area, near Pond, Wilkinson County, Mississippi The park was established in 1978 through the efforts of the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Committee, the Nature Conservancy, Wilkinson County, David Bramlette, International Paper Company and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. Flora and fauna The nature area has a mix of hardwood and pine forest with large beech and magnolia trees. The park includes the world record Mexican plum and bigleaf snowbell and the state of Mississippi record hophornbeam. Several uncommon trees that can be seen are Southern sugar maple, serviceberry, umbrella tree, pyramid magnolia, chinquapin oak and witch-hazel. The globally rare Carolina magnolia vine and many others are well marked. A checklist of the vascular plants was recorded in 1982, and it was one of the first surveys of plants in southwestern Mississippi. The park includes migratory birds, various snake varieties (both venomous and non-venomous), a rare land snail, white-tail deer, chipmunks, the Southern red belly dace (a state endangered fish), foxes, coyotes, squirrels, armadillos, feral pigs, bobcats, cottontail rabbits and black bear as well as many other species. Activities and amenities The park has both primitive and improved trails. The improved trails have been paved with pea gravel and include steep wooden stairs. Clark Creek's steeply sloping bluffs increase the difficulty of hiking. The length of the primitive trail is approximately and usually takes 3‚Äì5 hours to complete. The improved trails are approximately long and usually take around 2 hours to complete. Eight geocaches are located in the park. Restrictions The state has imposed various restrictions on visitors: park use is limited to pedestrian traffic year round; motorized vehicles are not allowed; hunting is prohibited; potable water is not available on the trails; camping is not permitted; ropes may not be used for climbing; hikers are required to stay on paths or in creeks. Dogs must be leashed at all times.

It was also issued as the fourth and final single from the album in March 1981. This was the last new David Bowie single issued by RCA Records. The lyric is often seen as a commentary on the public coverage of his divorce from Angela Bowie, one of several tracks on the album that muse over the double-edged sword of celebrity. It has also been interpreted as facing up to crisis in general.Roy Carr & Charles Shaar Murray (1981).

The B-side was \\"Crystal Japan\\", an instrumental recorded in 1980 for a Japanese commercial for the sake Crystal Jun Rock, which also featured an appearance from Bowie. \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" was originally slated as the B-side for \\"Up the Hill Backwards\\" until Bowie found out the prices fans were paying for the import single of \\"Crystal Japan\\", and insisted the track receive a UK release. The uncommercial nature of \\"Up the Hill Backwards\\", combined with the track having been available on the album for the past six months, saw the single stall at No. 32 in the UK chart. It also briefly charted at No. 49 in Canada. In the US, RCA only released a 12-inch single which was distributed with a set of 36 stamps, designed by David Bowie himself.

Col. Charles Mawhood (23 December 1729 - 29 August 1780) was a British army officer during the 18th century, most noted for his command during the Battle of Princeton. Military career His military service began with purchase of a cornetcy in 1st Dragoon Guards (1 August 1752). He served in the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), initially as a Captain in the 15th Light Dragoons, then transferred to 18th Light Dragoons. He subsequently saw action in Germany as aide-de-camp to Lord Granby. He continued to rise in rank during the peace, first to major in the 3rd Foot on 17 May 1763, then to lieutenant colonel of the 19th Foot on 17 June 1767. He transferred to the 17th Foot on 26 October 1775 and served with this regiment during General Howe's early campaigns of the American War of Independence. =Battle of Princeton= Mawhood was left in command of a force at Princeton, New Jersey by Lord Cornwallis in January 1777 while Cornwallis chased after George Washington's army after the Battle of Trenton. After Cornwallis's attack in Trenton was stopped, Washington sneaked his army around that of Cornwallis and attacked the Princeton garrison. Mawhood acquitted himself well in the battle, but much of the garrison was lost, and the British were driven out of most of New Jersey. Mawhood continued to serve in North America, seeing further action during the 1777‚Äì1778 Philadelphia campaign leading a mixed force of regulars, loyalists and rangers in a series of raids through New Jersey. =Gibraltar= Highly esteemed in England following the Battle of Princeton, he was chosen to raise a new regiment, the Royal Manchester Volunteers (72nd Foot), for service at the besieged garrison of Gibraltar. Mawhood died during the siege on 29 August 1780 after suffering from a gall-stone.

After decades working in the insurance industry, Bratt turned his attention to his hometown club Port Vale, after the club were facing dark times. Leading the 'Valiant 2001' supporter's trust, he gained control from the administrators and previous chairman Bill Bell in 2003. He then faced a constant battle to steady the club's finances whilst also advancing through the leagues. Though the team fared poorly on the pitch throughout his reign, falling to the bottom tier of the Football League, he managed to keep the club afloat financially, though still the club continued to lose money. He left the club after fan protests against his chairmanship. Early life Bratt's stepfather was a World War II veteran who was taken by the Japanese as a prisoner of war. After the war his father appeared to be mentally scarred from his time in POW camps and regularly beat him, he apologised to his son whilst on his deathbed. He died in the 1960s of cancer. He lived in numerous children's homes in the Penkhull area, before becoming a miner at Chatterley Whitfield pit in 1959. The charity he received from members of the church helped to instil Christian beliefs that he holds to this day (as of June 2009). From an early age he was a Port Vale supporter, something which would have a significant impact upon his life in the future. Business life Bratt worked in several coal-mines, but was forced to retire after a motorcycle accident severely damaged his left hand; he is now without a left thumb. He then tried several jobs, including selling encyclopaedias. However, Bratt built up his business acumen and earned a healthy income as an insurance broker over a 30-year period. During this time he also started a family - a son and a daughter. Chairmanship of Port Vale =Early years= In 2001, Bratt was involved with a consortium of fans and local businessmen under the banner \\"Valiant 2001\\", started by Charles Machin, which started moves towards attaining ownership of the club, including several offers that were rejected by chairman Bill Bell. The club went into administration under Bell in December 2002. Valiant 2001 eventually secured control of the club after a long and drawn-out process as the 2002‚Äì03 season neared its close. Their takeover bid beat that of a 'mystery bidder'. Bratt had been a lifelong supporter of the club when he took the chairman position in 2003.Bill Bratt named as chairman bbc.co.uk The Valiant2001 Charter, drafted by Charles Machin, listed ten points: *One: Set aside a ¬£1.5 million first-team budget *Two: Introduce supporter-friendly ticket pricing *Three: Complete the Lorne Street stand *Four: Sort out the pitch (install under-soil heating) *Five: Make savings of over ¬£80,000 *Six: Make Port Vale a fan- friendly football club *Seven: Make Port Vale a community-friendly football club *Eight: Run the club openly and democratically (at least 2 supporter- directors on the board) *Nine: Improve the club's relations *Ten: Be open, honest, professional and accountable Bratt put a large portion of the club's shares up for sale in February 2006. Robbie Williams bought ¬£240,000 worth of the ¬£250,000 worth of available shares in the club. Castle Comfort Stairlifts, the club's sponsors, at the same time bought the remainder for ¬£10,000.\\"Robbie buys into Vale\\", BBC.co.uk, 27 February 2006 Three months later Bratt also took up the role of Chief executive officer. Under Bratt's chairmanship, the club were relegated to the bottom tier of English league football after a dismal 2007‚Äì08 season. Bratt and his board of directors appointed five managers throughout their reign; Martin Foyle in 2004, Lee Sinnott in 2007, Dean Glover in 2008, Micky Adams in 2009, Jim Gannon in 2011, and Adams again in 2011. =Troubled relationship with the fans= Under Bratt, the club maintained their League One status, before a drop down the divisions which was only reversed when Micky Adams' appointment sparked a revival. In February 2009, with the club languishing near the bottom of the Football League, closer to relegation than the play-offs, many Vale fans organized protests against manager Glover and the board, including Bratt. With talks of fresh investment from shirt sponsors Harlequin Property came rumours on the internet that the company were planning to demolish Vale Park and build a supermarket, paying off Bratt to ensure his compliance. Bratt passionately denied these accusations, seemingly angered by the suggestion and claimed that if he were to comply with the protesters demands and remove himself and the rest of the V-2001 directors from the Board, then the club would fold as banks and creditors would seek their money. He also reiterated his prior statements by stating that he would be prepared to leave his position if the right offer were to be made. As Chairman he was sometimes criticized for the perceived unprofessional practices of the board. Critics citing the phone vote that was arranged to sack Sinnott and the way in which experienced midfielder Dave Brammer was released- informing him via voicemail. Sinnott later took the club to court for breach of contract. The appointment of Dean Glover was also unpopular with fans. Protests formed by fans against Glover and the board gave Bratt little option than to sack Glover, with season ticket sales seriously affected by disillusioned supporters. With a serious dent into his reputation he built as a player at the club, Glover left the club completely, however Bratt and the board stayed in place despite growing resentment from some corners. Bratt was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. In the summer of 2009 he collapsed and was paralysed from the waist down, he made a full recovery though after undergoing surgery at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Despite the club's recent troubles on the pitch, Bratt was delighted with the overwhelming support he received from the fans during his recovery: \\"I have had lots of cards, text messages and phone calls, so I'd like to thank everyone for that.\\" In July 2009, Bratt spoke out to publicly deny rumours spread on Vale fan sites, specifically rumours of sponsorship deals with Basement Jaxx and Maplin Electronics. Bratt said the rumours were \\"inaccurate, spurious and damaging\\", claiming the speculation could damage genuine and confidential negotiations. The next month he was able to say \\"we got the right man\\" in appointing Micky Adams, following a 2‚Äì1 win over Sheffield United in the League Cup. There also came statements that shirt sponsors Harlequin Property would invest ¬£500,000 into the club, though this never materialized. Reports that Andy Townsend would be appointed as a football advisor also surfaced, but never transpired. Bratt stated that he planned to stand down at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. However, when investor Mike Newton was willing to invest ¬£400,000 in the club and take the chair of the board at the season's end, Bratt claimed to be unhappy with Newton's policy of negotiating in public (who had by then upped his offer to ¬£500,000), and so Bratt remained chairman for the 2010‚Äì11 season. Newton claimed that his \\"efforts to become chairman and to invest in the club have been hampered and made almost impossible\\" by Bratt and his board, and said that the reasons giving to reject his investment were \\"one long round of excuses\\". Bratt also denied claims by Newton that the club were heading for administration under his leadership. In September 2010 Bratt gave up his role as Chief Executive, but remained as Chairman, denying that this decision was influenced by the recent Newton takeover bid. By this time the club's debts were estimated at around ¬£2m, a level described by Bratt as \\"manageable\\". In September 2010 Bratt owned ¬£44,120 of the club's ¬£1.132m shares, with the nine man board's total share value at ¬£359,400. In December 2010 local businessman and Water World owner Mo Chaudry went public with his investment proposal for the club, however Bratt said it was the first he had heard of the proposal, despite Chandry's legal advisor's claims they had spoken and that \\"it was made clear to me the club wasn't interested in selling to Mo Chaudry.\\" The board swiftly and unanimously rejected the ¬£1.3 million proposal. Following another anti-board protest from Vale supporters and the resignation of director Mike Thompstone following a vote of no confidence at a supporter shareholder meeting, Bratt and his team decided to re-examine the Chaudry bid. In January 2011, another group of prospective investors, this time a group of Texas businessmen, announced they had pulled out of talks with Bratt's board. The group said: \\"the deal is completely dead because the directors don't want to sell the club... we believe they [the Vale] are run by the wrong people... [and] we didn't get anything apart from a cup of tea before watching a game.\\" Fans began a protest movement called \\"Black and Gold Until it's Sold\\" - inspired by Manchester United's anti-Glazer scarf protest - in which fans wear black and gold scarves to symbolize their opposition to Bratt and the board. Despite this Chaudry's takeover deadline passed without comment from the Vale board, though another director, Paul Humphreys, resigned his position. After the board shunned a further joint offer by Chaudry and Mark Sims, Sims stated that he was \\"thoroughly disillusioned with the current board and, as a lifelong fan, I'm devastated by this season's promotion failure and the demise of our club over the past decade.\\" After an EGM was called on 1 June 2011, Bratt and his four fellow directors faced a vote to remove them. With major shareholders Robbie Williams and Broxap owner Robert Lee throwing their support behind Chaudry, few believed Bratt could survive the EGM. Despite a vote of no confidence in the board and directors Peter Jackson and Stan Meigh being voted out, Bratt and two other directors survived their individual votes. This was thanks to a last-minute decision by Lee to sell to an unnamed director and not Chaudry. Despite this, Bratt resigned as chairman on 29 July 2011, citing his wish to unite the fans and to leave behind the \\"hate\\" levelled at him in \\"the last 12 months\\" by his detractors. He remained a director, and he was a member of the board in September 2011, when it was announced that sports construction firm Blue Sky International were planning to plough ¬£5 million into the club in twelve months, as well as a further ¬£2.5 million by 2016. This sum would secure the long-term future of the club. He resigned as a director in October 2011. Two months later, the deal was shown to have had no substantive basis. He later became chairman of minor non-league side Stone Town.

The Continental Congress took a number of steps in the spring of 1775 to create the army in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April and the seizure of Fort Ticonderoga in May. The units composing the Continental Army changed frequently, especially in the first two years of the war. From 1777 to the close of the war, the organization of the Continental Army became progressively more systematic and sophisticated. The Continental Army that served at Yorktown in 1781 bore very little resemblance to the Continental Army that blockaded Boston in 1775. The Continental Congress was hostile to maintaining standing armies. Under the Articles of Confederation the Congress did not have the power to raise national troops by means of a draft. Enlistment in the Continental Army was voluntary; and throughout the war there were Americans who elected to fight for King George III rather than for Congress. Further, under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress could not raise its own revenue directly. Because of the resulting shortages in money and manpower, the Continental Army was often expected to work in conjunction with state-controlled militia units. These units were called out as needed for short periods. On several occasions the militia performed well, but Washington frequently noted the inefficiency of the militia in his correspondence. First establishment, 1775 On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress assumed responsibility for the regular troops that had been raised by the colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. This date is considered to be the founding date of the United States Army. Most of these troops were besieging the British garrison in Boston. The force adopted by the Continental Congress amounted to 39 regiments of infantry, and 1 regiment and 1 separate company of artillery. On the same date the Continental Congress for the first time ordered troops to be raised for national defense. It ordered that ten companies of \\"expert riflemen\\" be raised in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, specifying their organization, pay, and term of enlistment. Before this date, the Congress had merely adopted units already raised by the states or, as in New York, simply promised financial support for a stated number of troops, leaving further action to the state. In July 1775, a second force in New York under Major General Philip Schuyler was designated the New York Department, which would later be called the Northern Department. Schuyler's smaller army was created to defend New York, but he was authorized by the Continental Congress to launch a preemptive (and ultimately disastrous) invasion of Canada, which began on August 31, 1775.Wright, Continental Army, 41‚Äì3. The Continental regiments in the Southern colonies saw active service before the year ended, fighting forces raised by Virginia's royal governor, Lord Dunmore, at Great Bridge in December. In this action the 2nd Virginia Regiment was commanded by William Woodford, who later became a brigadier general in the Continental Army. Second establishment, 1776 At the end of 1775 the Siege of Boston was no nearer to resolution than it had been in April, and the attempt to capture Quebec had received a significant setback with the loss of the Battle of Quebec. To continue the war the Continental Congress voted to reraise the army at Boston and to maintain Continental units elsewhere. Before the Siege of Boston ended in March 1776 the Continental Congress was supporting troops from every colony except Maryland. The new units were to serve from January 1 to December 31, 1776. British troops withdrew from Boston in March 1776, after which commander in chief George Washington sent most of them to New York City where the British were expected to attack. The invasion of Quebec ended with an ignominious retreat to Fort Ticonderoga in July, and Continental troops participated in the defense of Charleston, South Carolina in the Battle of Sullivan's Island, and in North Carolina at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. Washington commanded forces moved from Boston and Ticonderoga in the failed defense of New York, losing at Long Island, White Plains and most seriously at Fort Washington, where nearly 3,000 soldiers were captured. Forced to retreat all the way across New Jersey to Pennsylvania, Washington closed the campaign season with major victories in the battles of Trenton and Princeton at the close of the year and early in 1777. The fact that his army was disbanding at the critical moment between Trenton and Princeton was the result of the unfortunate fact that its one-year term of service was then expiring, but Washington convinced a significant number of soldiers to overstay their enlistments. =Main Army= The bulk of the newly organized Main Army consisted of 27 infantry regiments, numbered in order of the seniority of the colonel of each regiment. These regiments were created by reorganizing existing units and by encouraging soldiers to reenlist for another year. Each new regiment comprised eight companies, which at full strength fielded a total of 728 men. Of these, 640 provided the firepower (privates and corporals with muskets); the remaining were officers and staff, including three field officers (a colonel, lieutenant colonel, and major), a captain for each company, a surgeon, a quartermaster, drummers, etc.Wright, Continental Army, 47, 50. Washington announced a new organization of the Main Army in General Orders, January 24, 1776.Fitzpatrick, Writings, IV:275‚Äì277. The organization was similar to the organization of 1775, but with new regiments. =Canadian Department= Established January 17, 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 60. Discontinued July 8, 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 62. In January 1776, Congress reorganized the New York Department, designating the force that had invaded Canada as the Canadian Department. Units were consolidated, and a second regiment of Canadians was recruited. After Washington learned of Brigadier General Richard Montgomery's death and defeat at the Battle of Quebec, three New England units originally intended as militia were instead raised as Continental regiments, commanded by Colonels Bedel, Porter, and Burrall,Wright, Continental Army, 58. and sent to Canada. At Quebec, Major General John Thomas took command of Canadian Department in May 1776. Additional reinforcements from the Main Army led by Brigadier General William Thompson arrived in mid-May, but were immediately disabled by an outbreak of smallpox. After General Thomas succumbed on June 2, Brigadier General John Sullivan, who had arrived with a second group of reinforcements on May 31, took command of the department. When British Major General John Burgoyne arrived in Quebec with reinforcements, the Americans withdrew to Fort Ticonderoga by July 1776. Major General Horatio Gates arrived to take command of the Canadian Department, but with no troops in Canada, the department ceased to exist. Gates, under Schuyler's Northern Department, organized 15 Continental units as the \\"Northern Army\\" in the Fort Ticonderoga area. The remaining units, some of them in poor shape after service in Canada, were retained by Schuyler as a rear echelon guarding the Mohawk River valley.Wright, Continental Army, 63. =Northern Department= Established from Middle Department, April 14, 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 84. Continued to January 15, 1783.Wright, Continental Army, 84; 431. =Eastern Department= Established April 4, 1776.Fitzpatrick, Writings, IV:467. Discontinued November 1779.Wright, Continental Army, 431. Following the British evacuation of Boston, Massachusetts, on March 17, 1776, Washington led the Continental Army (the Main Army) to New York City. He left a Continental garrison at Boston, under Major General Artemas Ward, in case the British should return. In the summer of 1776 it became clear to Washington that the main British effort would be directed against New York City and northern New York, and he reached the conclusion that the Continental regiments at Boston were more urgently needed elsewhere. He therefore ordered them to reinforce either his own army or the Northern Army under Major General Philip Schuyler.Fitzpatrick, Writings, VI:219. The Eastern Department became a secondary theater until the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778. ;Rhode Island Garrison Regiments Two regiments of Rhode Island state troops served with the Continental Army in 1776, but were not placed on the Continental establishment.Berg, Encyclopedia, 106. =Middle Department= Established February 27, 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 82. Continued to close of war. The Middle Department was originally created as a military administrative district embracing New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. When the Main Army moved from Boston to New York in April 1776 and Washington opened his headquarters in New York City, he assumed direct command of the department. As a result, the Main Army became, for the remainder of the war, the field army associated with the Middle Department. At the same time New York and the Northern Department became practically coextensive; only the Hudson Highlands and parts of New York to the south remained in the Middle Department.Wright, Continental Army, 83‚Äì84. These changes left Washington holding three posts at once: Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, Commanding General of the field army under his immediate command, the Main Army, and Commanding General of the Middle Department. =Southern Department= Established February 27, 1776. Continued to close of war. The Continental Congress raised troops in the southern colonies before the Southern Department was created. It had called for troops from the Southern colonies eight months before the department was established. On the date that the Southern Department came into existence the Continental Congress had accepted or authorized a dozen Southern infantry regiments, a number that would double within the next six months. North Carolina Continentals As early as June 26, 1775, some eight weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress voted to support 1,000 men in North Carolina.Wright, Continental Army, 71. These were organized as the 1st and 2d North Carolina Regiments of 1775. A third North Carolina regiment was raised in January 1776 and two more regiments were raised in March. A sixth North Carolina regiment was authorized in April. All six of these regiments had become a part of the Continental Army by the summer of 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 71‚Äì72. Virginia Continentals The Continental Congress assumed responsibility for the two existing Virginia provincial regiments on November 1, 1775. These were the 1st and 2d Virginia Regiments of 1775. On December 28, 1775 the Continental Congress requested four more regiments from Virginia. In January 1776 the colony authorized these six regiments for the Continental Army and authorized three more regiments as state troops. All nine of these regiments had become a part of the Continental Army by the summer of 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 67‚Äì70. A separate company of artillery was authorized by Virginia on December 1, 1775. In March the Continental Congress adopted this company and authorized one more.Wright, Continental Army, 70‚Äì71. South Carolina and Georgia Continentals On November 4, 1775 ‚Äì the same date on which it authorized the 27 numbered Continental regiments of 1776 ‚Äì the Congress authorized two battalions from South Carolina and one battalion from Georgia for the Continental Army. South Carolina then transferred the 1st and 2d South Carolina Regiments to the Continental Army. Two more South Carolina provincial regiments (5th and 6th regiments of rifles) were adopted by the Continental Army on March 25, 1776, followed by the 4th Regiment of Artillery on June 18, 1776. The 3rd Regiment of mounted rangers was adopted on July 24, 1776.Wright, Continental Army, 73. Establishment of the department In February 1776 a superior headquarters was urgently needed to administer the rapidly growing number of Continental regiments being raised in the South. The Southern Army, as the troops in the Southern Department were known, met its first major test successfully when it repulsed the British attack on Charleston, South Carolina, on June 28, 1776. Third establishment, 1777‚Äì1784 Despite its antipathy to standing armies the Continental Congress was forced by the loss of New York and the prospect of a permanent British presence there to raise a standing army of its own. Congress created the third establishment on September 16, 1776, voting to raise an army of 88 regiments of infantry. Each of the thirteen states was assigned a quota based on its population. Enlistments in this army were to be for either three years or the duration of the war. This program was augmented in December 1776 when Washington was given authority to raise an additional 16 regiments of infantry (see \\"Additional\\" regiments). The army of 1777 was also a better-balanced force than the two which preceded it. Besides the infantry, the artillery was increased to a brigade under Henry Knox, a cavalry brigade was organized, originally under Casimir Pulaski, and eventually the Continental Army included partisan units, engineer troops, military police, and invalids. In 1777, 119 regiments were fielded. On paper these regiments contained over 90,000 officers and men.Wright, Continental Army, 119. In later years this ambitious program was reduced to one that was more sustainable, through consolidation or elimination of surplus units. The Continental Army of 1777 was a result of several critical reforms and political decisions that came about when it was apparent that the British were sending massive forces to put an end to the Revolution. In order to create a more stable, better trained army that would not cease to exist at the end of each year ‚Äî the army had nearly collapsed at the end of 1776 ‚Äî men were now enlisted for the duration of the war. Because many men were reluctant to enlist for such an indefinite period, Congress also offered the alternative of a three‚Äìyear enlistment.Wright, Continental Army, 93. =Eighty-Eight Battalion Resolve= On September 16, 1776, the Continental Congress passed the \\"eighty-eight battalion resolve,\\" which called for each state to contribute regiments in proportion to their population. (The terms regiment and battalion were virtually interchangeable at that time since nearly every Continental Army regiment consisted of a single battalion). The quota of infantry regiments was fixed at 15 each from Massachusetts and Virginia, 12 from Pennsylvania, 9 from North Carolina, 8 each from Connecticut and Maryland, 6 from South Carolina, 4 each from New York and New Jersey, 3 from New Hampshire, 2 from Rhode Island, and 1 each from Delaware and Georgia. Each state was expected to arm, clothe, and equip its regiments. A state's quota of infantry regiments was collectively known as that state's \\"line\\", such as the Pennsylvania Line. A state \\"line\\" was an administrative designation and not a tactical formation like a brigade or division.Wright, Continental Army, 99 fn. =Washington's \\"Dictatorial Powers\\"= Washington and his generals believed that 88 regiments were insufficient to challenge the British Army, and so on December 27, 1776, Congress gave Washington the authority to raise additional regiments which were placed directly under his control and not under any state. These additional units consisted of 16 infantry regiments, three artillery regiments, a corps of engineers, and 3,000 light horsemen. Including three other regiments previously authorized by Congress (the two Canadian regiments and Seth Warner's regiment of Green Mountain Boys), 110 regiments were authorized for the Continental Army of 1777. Some states exceeded their quotas, and so 119 regiments were actually fielded in 1777. The decisions implemented in 1777 determined the basic organizational structure of the Continental Army for the duration of the war. Although the army raised in 1777 was the army which served until the close of the war, the Continental Army of 1777 underwent a general reorganization on three important occasions. =Reorganizations= Continental Army soldiers 1782. In the right foreground is an enlisted artilleryman. In the left and center foreground are shown a captain and a lieutenant. A watercolor painting by Charles M. Lefferts depicting a variety of Continental Army uniforms On 27 May 1778 Congress reduced the quota of infantry regiments in the state lines to 80. The new regiments were smaller by one-third to cut expenses, and for the first time included a permanent light infantry company. The light infantry companies were organized collectively into a Corps of Light Infantry modeled on that of the British Army, to replace provisional light infantry units drafted from line companies for the 1777 and 1778 campaigns. The quota of infantry regiments was so adjusted that Massachusetts provided 15, Pennsylvania and Virginia each provided 11, Connecticut and Maryland each provided 8, North Carolina and South Carolina each provided 6, New York provided 5, New Hampshire and New Jersey each provided 3, Rhode Island provided 2, and Delaware and Georgia each provided 1. Congress also consolidated some of the weaker Additional Continental Regiments. Because this reorganization was proposed just as the campaign of 1778 was about to begin, it was implemented gradually over the next ten months, and finalized on March 9, 1779.Wright, Continental Army, 146. In October 1780, with the three-year enlistments of 1777 soon to expire, the Continental Congress ordered a new organization of the Continental Army, to become effective on January 1, 1781. The number of infantry regiments was reduced to 50 (including Hazen's 2d Canadian Regiment, which was retained as the Canadian Regiment). The new regiments were larger, and for the first time they included a regimental depot. The quota of infantry regiments was fixed at 10 from Massachusetts, 8 from Virginia, 6 from Pennsylvania, 5 each from Connecticut and Maryland, 4 from North Carolina, 2 each from New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, and South Carolina, and 1 each from Rhode Island, Delaware, and Georgia. The few Additional Continental Regiments that had survived to this late date were either allotted to a state line or disbanded. The support of the Continental Army's cavalry and artillery regiments was also made the responsibility of a definite state for the first time, but they retained their status as separate branches of the Continental Army. As of January 1, 1781, the states were made responsible for regiments in other branches as follows: 1st and 3rd Legionary Corps (formerly 1st and 3d Light Dragoons): Virginia; 2d Legionary Corps (2nd Light Dragoons): Connecticut; and 4th Legionary Corps (4th Light Dragoons): Pennsylvania ‚Äî 1st Artillery: Virginia; 2d Artillery: New York; 3d Artillery: Massachusetts; and 4th Artillery: Pennsylvania. Thus the total number of regimental equivalents was reduced to 61. This number included 50 infantry regiments, 4 legionary corps (which were partly dismounted light dragoons), 4 artillery regiments, 2 partisan corps, and 1 artificer regiment.Wright, Continental Army, 157. Finally, on August 7, 1782, the Continental Congress resolved that the Continental Army should be so reduced that, if possible, all its units should contain at least 500 rank and file. This reorganization was to become effective on January 1, 1783. Under this resolve, the infantry of the Continental Army was reorganized to consist of 1 regiment and 1 battalion (4 companies) from New Hampshire (effected March 1, 1783), 8 regiments from Massachusetts, 1 battalion (6 companies) from Rhode Island, 3 regiments from Connecticut, 2 regiments from New York, 1 regiment and 1 battalion (4 companies) from New Jersey (effected March 1, 1783), 3 regiments from Pennsylvania, 1 regiment (2 companies) from Delaware, 2 regiments from Maryland, 2 regiments from Virginia, 1 regiment and 1 battalion from North Carolina, 2 regiments from South Carolina, and 1 regiment (3 companies) from Georgia. In this instance, with some exceptions, the term \\"battalion\\" was used to designate a unit with less than the regulation nine companies.Wright, Continental Army, 176‚Äì177. Demobilization When the Continental Army was demobilized in 1783, a single regiment, the 1st American Regiment remained, under the command of Colonel Henry Jackson. In 1784 this regiment was disbanded. A single company of artillery was reassigned to a new regiment, the First American Regiment, the predecessor to the United States Army's 3rd US Infantry Regiment.

Roger Linn is also a member of the Dead Presidents Society, a group of innovators in the field of electronic music.Dead Presidents Society  Linn Electronics  In 1979, Roger Linn and Alex Moffett founded Linn Moffett Electronics (soon to be renamed Linn Electronics) to develop Linn's design for a drum machine that uses digital samples. It would be called LM-1 for Linn/Moffett/1. Moffett left the company in 1982. Linn used his new drum machine and performed with Leon Russell on his album Life and Love in 1979.All Music, Life And Lovediscogs.com Life And Love = LM-1 = Linn LM-1 In 1980, Roger Linn released the world's first drum machine to use digital samples, the LM-1 Drum Computer.Hey, what's that sound: Linn LM-1 Drum Computer and the Oberheim DMX by David McNamee The Guardian The LM-1 was the first drum machine to use samples of a real drum kit, which Linn recorded with Los Angeles session drummer Art Wood https://www.amazona.de/interview-roger-linn-comeback- einer-legende/3/ Examples of the LM-1 in use can be found on recordings by Prince, Gary Numan, and Michael Jackson. = LinnDrum = LinnDrum In 1982 Linn released the LinnDrum as the successor to the LM-1. It improved on the LM-1 in some ways like the addition of crash and ride cymbal samples. One drawback: on the LinnDrum only the snare, tom and conga samples can be tuned, whereas the LM-1 allows every sound to be individually tuned. Its high-quality samples, flexibility and affordability made the LinnDrum popular. It sold more units than its predecessor (the LM-1) and its successor (the Linn 9000) combined. The LinnDrum was used on countless recordings throughout the 1980s, including a-Ha's international hit \\"Take On Me\\". = Linn 9000 = Linn 9000 In 1984 Linn released the Linn 9000 as the successor to the LinnDrum. It was the first integrated digital drum machine and MIDI sequencer. The 9000 had innovative features, like dynamic sensitive rubber pads, and would influence many future drum machine designs. But chronic software bugs led to a reputation for unreliability and contributed to the eventual demise of the company. The 9000 can be heard on Michael Jackson's 1987 album, Bad, on the cuts \\"Bad\\", \\"Man in the Mirror\\" and \\"Liberian Girl\\". = LinnSequencer = LinnSequencer In 1985 Linn released the LinnSequencer, a rack mount 32 track hardware MIDI sequencer. It used the same flawed operating system used in the Linn 9000. As a result, the machine earned a reputation for unreliability. = LinnDrum Midistudio = LinnDrum Midistudio In January 1986, Linn debuted the LinnDrum Midistudio at the Winter NAMM Show as the successor to the Linn 9000. The Midistudio is essentially a rack mount version of the Linn 9000 with some improvements. It used the same flawed operating system used in the Linn 9000. It never went into production because Linn Electronics went out of business the following month. Similarities between the LinnDrum Midistudio and the Akai MPC series lead some to perceive a family resemblance. Most notably, the Midistudio has sixteen dynamic sensitive rubber pads in the distinctive, four by four pattern, that would become the hallmark of the MPCs, starting with the MPC60. = Legacy = Linn Electronics went out of business in February 1986. Forat Electronics purchased their remaining assets, manufactured and sold the Forat F9000 and LinnSequencer until 1994 and provide service, sounds, customization and upgrades for the entire Linn Electronics line. The LM-1, LinnDrum and Linn 9000 became synonymous with the music of the 1980s. The Linn 9000 and LinnDrum Midistudio pioneered the concept of the Music Production Center or MPC.  Akai MPC  After Linn Electronics, Linn collaborated with the Japanese company Akai to design the MPC60, an integrated digital sampling drum machine and MIDI sequencer released in 1988. According to Linn, \\"[The collaboration] was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer with ideas and I didn't want to do sales, marketing, finance or manufacturing, all of which Akai was very good at.\\" The MPC60 was followed by the MPC60 MkII and the MPC3000. Linn aimed to design an affordable user- friendly instrument that did not require extensive musical knowledge or studio equipment to use. It had a major influence on the development of hip hop and electronic music. The 4x4 grid of pads was adopted by numerous manufacturer and became standard in DJ technology. Linn left Akai after the company went out of business and its assets were purchased by Numark. According to Linn, the new organization was led by \\"a very unscrupulous fellow ... he immediately stopped my royalty payments, refused to take my calls and had his lawyer send me threatening letters. I checked around and learned that he has a reputation of being a real bastard, so given that challenging him would have been long and expensive, I let it go.\\" Akai has continued to produce MPC models without Linn, such as the MPC2000; Linn was critical, saying: \\"Akai seems to be making slight changes to my old 1986 designs for the original MPC, basically rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\\"  Roger Linn Design  In 2001 Roger Linn founded a new company, Roger Linn Design. The company's first product offering was the AdrenaLinn, with the LinnStrument music performance controller added later. = AdrenaLinn = AdrenaLinn II (front) The AdrenaLinn is a digital multi-effects unit with a drum machine and amp modeler all in one, designed by Roger Linn with some help from Dave Smith (credited with helping to conceive MIDI) and Tom Oberheim (designer of early analog synthesizers). Most notably, unlike other guitar pedals, the AdrenaLinn specializes in beat-synced effects, including modulation and delay but also a sequencer that provides looped patterns of filtered tones, all moving in sync to its internal drum machine or to midi. The drum section can also be affected by the filter section, allowing dance-style beats. Other unusual aspects of this pedal include note-triggered filter effects such as auto-wah, simulated talk box and guitar synthesizer sounds. The AdrenaLinn technology was also the basis of Roger Linn's partnership with M-Audio to create the Black Box guitar multi-effect and recording unit. The AdrenaLinn can be heard on the following records (among many others): * John Mayer ‚Äì \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\", from the 2009 album Battle Studies, \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" from the 2003 album Heavier Things and \\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" from the 2006 album Continuum * Green Day ‚Äì \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" from the 2004 album American Idiot * Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì By The Way ‚Äì Warner Bros. ‚Äì 2002 (produced by Rick Rubin) * Morcheeba ‚Äì Parts Of The Process ‚Äì Reprise Records ‚Äì 2003 * Soda Stereo ‚Äì Disco Eterno ‚Äì Sony Music ‚Äì 1995 * Marillion ‚Äì Marbles ‚Äì 2004Roger Linn Design: AdrenaLinn or AdrenaLinn II The AdrenaLinn was followed-up with the AdrenaLinn II and AdrenaLinn III. = LinnDrum II = Roger Linn and Dave Smith announced co-development of a drum machine product, originally to be called BoomChik, but changed to LinnDrum II in December 2007, a reference to one of Linn's early popular drum machines: the LinnDrum. The LinnDrum II was renamed the Tempest, and co-released by Roger Linn Designs and Dave Smith Instruments in 2011. = LinnStrument = In late 2014 Linn released the LinnStrument, a music performance controller with 3D note expression, after several years of development. The grid based MIDI controller, playable with one or two hands, is velocity sensitive, but also senses three dimensions per finger, polyphonically. It can employ MPE, thereby using a full MIDI channel per note. Two versions are available, the larger original LinnStrument as well as the smaller LinnStrument 128. Almost the entire surface of the controller is covered by its 8 by 25 (or 8 by 16 in the case of the LinnStrument 128) grid. The fingertip-sized fields are each able to measure and transmit velocity, aftertouch, x-position relative to the entire row (or any subset thereof), y-position within a field, as well as release velocity. It is highly adaptable and can also function in more traditional MIDI configurations, accommodating sound generators that don't yet support MPE and allowing them to be played more expressively. The LinnStrument has several additional features, such as an arpeggiator, a velocity-sensitive step sequencer as well as freely assignable virtual MIDI faders. It is USB- powered and can communicate via USB or 5-pin MIDI.  Music career  Roger Linn has had a level of songwriting success, penning hits (\\"Promises\\", Eric Clapton 1979; \\"Quittin' Time\\", Lou Ann Barton 1986, Mary Chapin Carpenter 1991, Amy Bishop 2009), and having toured as a guitarist with the pianist/songwriter Leon Russell in the 1970s at age 21. In 2011 Roger was awarded a Grammy Award for Lifetime Technical Achievement, recognizing his many contributions to the music recording industry.

Biography Born in Florence, the young Foggini was sent to Rome by the Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany to join the so-called Accademia Fiorentina, and apprentice in the Roman sculptural studio of Ercole Ferrata, a pupil of Algardi. He was also tutored in drawing by the Accademia's first director (1673-86), Ciro Ferri, who was a pupil of Cortona. Returning to Florence in 1676, he became the court sculptor for Cosimo III.See Foggini's portrait of the duke Chained captive, Asia by Foggini Chained captive, Africa by Foggini After the son of Pietro Tacca, Fernando, died in 1686, the mantle of the premier local sculptor fell to Foggini, who would become the Medici's Architetto Primario e Primo scultore della Casa Serenissima as well as Soprintendente dei Lavori (1687‚Äì1725).Cannon-Brookes, p. 778 In 1687, Foggini acquired the foundry in Borgo Pinti that had once belonged to the sculptor Giambologna.

Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. In Florence, his masterpieces are his sculptural relief work in the Capella Corsini of the Chiesa del Carmine. The chapel was erected by Bartolomeo and Cardinal Neri Corsini in memory of their recently canonizedDied 1373 and canonized in 1629 by Urban VIII ancestral family member, San Andrea Corsini. It contains three large marble reliefs depicting his life: San Andrea in Glory, The Mass of San Andrea Corsini and The Battle of Anghiari (1685‚Äì87). He also completed works in Cappella Feroni in the Annunziata. Another work is the main staircase of the Medici-Riccardi Palace in Florence. Among his small bronzes are David with the Head of Goliath.An example is in the Cleveland Museum of Art (Frederick Den Broeder and John D. Cooney, \\"Giovanni Battista Foggini: David with the Head of Goliath\\", The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 54.1 [January 1967:22-26]). Foggini's pupils included Fernando Fuga, his nephew Filippo della Valle, Balthasar Permoser, Giovacchino Fortini and Giovanni Baratta. Massimiliano Soldani Benzi was a contemporary student with Foggini in Rome and also active in small bronze sculpture.

Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed. Taxonomy for this genus is currently being reanalysed, with the genus Hebe and the related Australasian genera Derwentia, Detzneria, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe and Parahebe now included by many botanists. Monophyly of the genus is supported by nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cpDNA. The taxa of the genus are herbaceous annuals or perennials, and also subshrubs, shrubs or small trees if Hebe is included. Most of the species are from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, though with some species from the Southern Hemisphere; Hebe is mostly from New Zealand. Etymology The genus name Veronica used in binomial nomenclature was chosen by Carl Linnaeus based on preexisting common usage of the name veronica in many European languages for plants in this group. Such use in English is attested as early as 1572.\\"veronica\\", Oxford English Dictionary, online edition. The name probably reflects a connection with Saint Veronica, whose Latin name is ultimately derived from Greek, Berenice.Ernest Klein, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. Elsevier 1967 Uses =Food and medicine= Veronica americana is edible and nutritious, as are most species in the genus Veronica, and is reported to have a flavor similar to watercress. The plant can be confused with skullcap and other members of the mint family. Members of the mint family have square sided stems, and Veronica species have rounded stems.Tilford, G. L. Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West. Veronica sp. herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea) for treatment of disorders of the nervous system, respiratory tract, cardiovascular system, and metabolism. =Ground cover= Several Veronica species and cultivars are cultivated for use as ground cover.Klett, J. E. and R. A. Cox. Ground Cover Plants. Fact Sheet no. 7.400. Colorado State University Extension. 2009. As weeds Several species of speedwell are sometimes considered weeds in lawns.Corn Speedwell. TurfFiles. Some of the more common of these are Persian speedwell (V. persica),Persian speedwell. Weed Gallery. U.C. Davis. creeping speedwell (V. filiformis),Creeping Speedwell. MSU Turf Weeds.

Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Michigan State University. germander speedwell (V. chamaedrys), and ivy-leaved speedwell (V. hederifolia). It is often difficult to tell one species from another. There are five to seven species of speedwell in Michigan alone that are easily confused. Ecology Species of Veronica are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including the grizzled skipper. An annual life history is known to have evolved separately several times within the genus, with up to 10% of the genus now having an annual life cycle. An annual life cycle, and associated morphological traits, is an adaptation thought to have developed in response to an extremely arid or generally unpredictable environment, and may persist in Veronica due to a historic concentration and radiation of members of the genus in and from the climatically volatile Balkan Peninsula.

Its chemical structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a methoxy group and an allyl group. It is an isomer of anethole, differing with respect to the location of the double bond. It is a colorless liquid, although impure samples can appear yellow. It is a component of various trees and plants, including turpentine (pine oil), anise, fennel, bay, tarragon, and basil. It is used in the preparation of fragrances.. The compound is named for estragon, the French name of tarragon. Production Hundreds of tonnes of basil oil are produced annually by steam distillation of Ocimum basilicum (common basil). This oil is mainly estragole but also contains substantial amounts of linalool. Estragole is the primary constituent of essential oil of tarragon (comprising 60‚Äì75%). It is also present in pine oil, turpentine, fennel, anise (2%), Clausena anisata and Syzygium anisatum. Estragole is used in perfumes and is restricted in flavours as a biologically active principle: it can only be present in a flavour by using an essential oil. Upon treatment with potassium hydroxide, estragole converts to anethole. A known use of estragole is in the synthesis of magnolol. Safety Estragole is suspected to be carcinogenic and genotoxic, as is indicated by a report of the European Union Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products.EMEA/HMPC/137212/2005, Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. Final Public Statement on the Use of Herbal Medicinal Products Containing Estragole http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/04/WC500089960.pdf Several studies have clearly established that the profiles of metabolism, metabolic activation, and covalent binding are dose dependent and that the relative importance diminishes markedly at low levels of exposure (that is, these events are not linear with respect to dose). In particular, rodent studies show that these events are minimal probably in the dose range of 1‚Äì10 mg/kg body weight, which is approximately 100 to 1,000 times the anticipated human exposure to this substance. For these reasons it is concluded that the present exposure to estragole resulting from consumption of herbal medicinal products (short time use in adults at recommended posology) does not pose a significant cancer risk. In the meantime exposure of estragole to sensitive groups such as young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women should be minimized. The Scientific Committee on Food from the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate took a more concerned position and concluded that \\"Estragole has been demonstrated to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. Therefore the existence of a threshold cannot be assumed and the Committee could not establish a safe exposure limit. Consequently, reductions in exposure and restrictions in use levels are indicated.\\"SCF/CS/FLAV/FLAVOUR/6, 26 September 2001, Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on Estragole (1-Allyl-4-methoxybenzene)  See also  * Anethole, an isomer * Chavicol, the phenol analog * Safrole, a methylenedioxy analog References External links * Opinion by the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Union on Estragole Category:Food additives Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Phenylpropenes Category:Phenol ethers Category:Allyl compounds Category:O-Methylated natural phenols ","title":"Estragole"},{"id":"3386341","text":"Pil√≠n Le√≥n (born Carmen Josefina Le√≥n Crespo, May 19, 1963) is a Venezuelan writer for newspapers who won the Miss World Venezuela 1981 crown and later Miss World pageant in 1981, held in London, United Kingdom, representing Venezuela.

The Regency period in the United Kingdom is the period between 1811 and 1820, when King George III was deemed unfit to rule and his son, later George IV, was instated to be his proxy as Prince Regent. It was a decade of particular manners and fashions, and overlaps with the Napoleonic period in Europe. Regency novels are of two main types: * Classic Regency fiction, or fiction actually written during the Regency era - The works of Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, Susan Ferrier, and Maria Edgeworth would fall into this category. * Modern Regency fiction, or later fiction set within the Regency era. - These include romance novels (called \\"Regency romances\\"), historical fiction, detective fiction, and military fiction. In both cases the setting is typically Regency England, although the settings can sometimes be extended to the European continent or to the various British colonies of the same time period. Traits often found in both types include a highly developed sense of social standing on the part of the characters, emphasis on \\"manners\\" and class issues, and the emergence of modern social thought amongst the upper classes of England. Classic Regency fiction This includes works which were actually written between 1811 and 1820, during the Regency era, which is well known for romantic fiction, including the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Sir Walter Scott, Susan Ferrier, Maria Edgeworth, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Jane Austen, who is perhaps the best-known author from this period, with many of her novels having been adapted into film in recent years. All of these writers published most of their best-known works during this period. While not novelists, the poetry of writers such as Lord Byron, William Blake, William Wordsworth, and John Keats are worth mentioning, as most of their best-known works were also written during the Regency. Many of these classic Regency writers are also associated with Romanticism, which is an artistic and intellectual movement that originated in Western Europe in the late 18th century. Romanticism expressed a revolt against the aristocratic, social, and political norms of the Enlightenment period which preceded it. Works during this period stressed strong emotion as a source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as anxiety, horror, and the awe experienced when confronting the sublimity of nature. All of these themes are evident in the best-known classic Regency works. A marriage based on love was rarely an option for most women in the British Regency, as securing a steady and sufficient income was the first consideration for both the woman and her family. This is most likely why this period yielded so many examples of literary romance: it gave many women the opportunity to live vicariously through the novel's heroine, who generally married someone she loved deeply. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was published in 1818, also falling within the Regency era. Some consider it to be the single piece of British literature that best reflects the interests and concerns of the time, specifically the fascination with and fear of the science and technological advances of the times. It is a classic example of horror fiction. Modern Regency fiction Fiction set in the Regency period grew in popularity during the late 20th century, leading to an increased number of novels in all of the categories. There has also been some Regency-set science fiction and fantasy, such as Naomi Novik's Temeraire books and some of Patricia Wrede's novels. Authors generally attempt to write in a more British style, even if they are American, and they tend to favor slightly more formal or historical language. Despite painstaking detail of historical accuracy, some criticize modern Regency novels for the behavior of the protagonists being more reflective of modern times than of the early 1800s. =Historical semi-fiction= This includes modern works based in the Regency that do not fall into any of the other categories, and may include historical characters such as the Prince Regent, or other notable historical figures during the Regency era. They may even be fiction based on a true story, where true events are expanded into a narrative that contains elements of fiction. It may also feature notable historical occurrences during the Regency, such as the slave trade to the Americas and the barbary slave trade of Europeans in northern Africa. Many north African slave narratives were written during this time, some of which have been adapted into modern novels set in the Regency, such as author Tahir Shah's Timbuctoo, an historical romance based on the real-life story of Robert Adams and set primarily in Regency England. =Military fiction= The Napoleonic Wars were a series of wars that were declared against Napoleon's French Empire by opposing coalitions that ran from 1803 to 1815, coinciding almost exactly with the Regency Era. They include the War between Britain and France, which lasted from 1803 to 1814. Military fiction set in the Regency generally includes characters from British troops who were involved in this war. Well- known authors include Bernard Cornwell, C.S. Forester, and Patrick O'Brian. More recently, Novik (see above) refights the Napoleonic Wars with dragons for air support. =Mysteries= These include mystery novels set in Regency-era England, some of which have been written as a series, such as Kate Ross's four book series featuring the character Julian Kestrel. Other well-known authors include: Stephanie Barron, Carrie Bebris, Ashley Gardner, and Rosemary Stevens. =Romances= The Regency period, overlapping as it does with the Napoleonic War period in Europe, offers the opportunity for high drama, with wounded heroes, mystery, and adventure, and thus would help to explain the popularity of Regency romance novels in particular. Well-known authors include: Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Nancy Butler, Marion Chesney, Georgette Heyer, Lisa Kleypas, Stephanie Laurens, Sorcha MacMurrough, Amanda McCabe Barbara Metzger, Julia Quinn, and Joan Smith. Many readers and writers of Regency romance make a distinction between \\"traditional Regency romance\\" (also known as \\"Regency romance\\"), \\"traditional Regency\\" (also known as \\"trad\\"), and \\"Regency historical\\". Many authors have written both traditionals and historicals, including Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Susan Carroll, Loretta Chase, Suzanne De Launton, Edith Layton, Mary Jo Putney, and Barbara Metzger. Christian Regency romance This genre includes modern romance novels set in the Regency with strong Christian themes. Authors include Bonnie Blythe, Heather Diane, Laurie Alice Eakes, Julie Klassen, and Ruth Axtell Morren. There is generally a strong romantic theme throughout these novels, without the racy sex scenes often found in other modern Regency works. Traditional Regency romance The Regency-set books published by the Fawcett Coventry line are all considered to be \\"trads\\", or traditional Regency works. The distinction rests on the genre definition of regency romance: works in the tradition of Georgette Heyer, with an emphasis on the primary romance plot, would be considered traditional. Traditional Regency romance writers usually pay close attention to historical detail, as their readers are notorious for noting errors, and the authors often do extensive research so they can clearly understand and replicate the voice of the genre. Regency historical romance The Regency-set books written by authors such as Amanda Quick, Christina Dodd, and Suzanne De Launton are generally considered to be Regency historical works. Signet Regency romances were also popular for many years, and can still be found online second-hand. Regency romances which may include more social realism, or, conversely, anachronistically modern characterization, might be classed by some as \\"Regency historical\\", signifying that their general setting is in Regency England, but the plot, characterization, or prose style of the work extends beyond the genre formula of the Regency romances published by Heyer and Fawcett Characters may behave according to modern values, rather than Regency values. The sensual Regency historical romance has been made popular in recent years by Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Lisa Kleypas, Stephanie Laurens, Sorcha MacMurrough, and Julia Quinn. Balogh and Beverley, in addition to Loretta Chase are three authors who have made the transition from writing traditional Regency novels to Regency historical novels. These novels are much more explicit than the traditional Regency works, and include many more love scenes, which tend to be racy. In addition, these novels are often published in a series, with groups of friends of either gender the focus of interest as they get married off one by one.

Serving throughout the IDF, non-Jews commonly also serve in the Druze Reconnaissance Unit and the Bedouin Trackers Unit as well as all other units in the IDF. History Bedouin soldiers in 1949 IDF \\"Sword\\" Battalion exercise in 2011 The Sword Battalion was formed in the early summer of 1948 by incorporating a unit of Druze defectors from the Arab Liberation Army and small numbers of Bedouin and Circassians. The unit was attached to the Oded Brigade and fought in Operation Hiram in October 1948. It has fought in every war since. Today, most members of the unit are Druze, but there are also Bedouins, Circassians and Christian and Muslim Arabs. The unit has produced several generals. The Sword Battalion has a small elite Sayeret Special Forces branch. Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription to the IDF. In the mid-1950s, the Druze leadership appealed to David Ben-Gurion, then Minister of Defense, to draft Druze men on the same basis as Jews. The State Defense Act of 1949, which called for drafting all individuals in the country, allowed the minister to issue exemptions for certain groups. The Druze asked that their exemption be canceled. Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit. Since the 1980s, Druze soldiers have joined regular combat units, attaining high ranks and commendations for distinguished service. 83 percent of Druze boys serve in the army, according to IDF statistics. According to the Israeli army, 369 Druze soldiers have been killed in combat operations since 1948. There is a long-standing government policy of encouraging Bedouins to volunteer and offering them various inducements. In some Bedouin communities a military career is seen as a means of social mobility. Muslim and Christian Arabs are also accepted as volunteers.

All major cities are connected by rail, and South Africa's railway system is the most highly developed in Africa.South Africa ‚Äì ICOMOS World Report on Monuments and Sites in Danger 2002: Heritage @ Risk The South African rail industry is publicly owned.  History  Rail network in 1892 The first railway was from Cape Town to Wellington and was worked by a small locomotive in 1859. The first passenger carrying service was a small line of about built by the Natal Railway Company, linking the town of Durban with Harbour Point, opened on 26 June 1860. Cape Town had already started building a line, track gauge , linking Cape Town to Wellington in 1859 but was hampered by delays and could only begin passenger service to the first section of the line to the Eerste River on 13 February 1862. However Cape railway construction began a massive expansion, after the formation in 1872 of the Cape Government Railways.Burman, Jose (1984), Early Railways at the Cape, Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, In the north, in the independent South African Republic, railway construction was done by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM), which constructed two major lines: one from Pretoria to Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese East Africa Colony, and a shorter line connecting Pretoria to Johannesburg. A national \\"link-up\\" was established in 1898, creating a national transport network.SAR & Transnet History This national network was largely completed by 1910. Though railway lines were also being extended outside of South Africa, as far north as Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia),SA Railway History the vision of Cecil John Rhodes, to have a rail system that would run from the \\"Cape to Cairo\\", would never materialise. Upon the merger of four provinces to establish the modern state of South Africa in 1910, the railway lines across the country were also merged. South African Railways and Harbours (SAR & H) was the government agency responsible for, amongst other things, the country's rail system. Electrification of the railways began in the 1920s with the building of the Colenso Power Station for the Glencoe to Pietermaritzburg route and the introduction of the South African Class 1E. During the 1980s, the transport industry was reorganised. Instead of being a direct government agency, it was modelled along business lines into a government-owned corporation called Transnet. Transnet Freight Rail (until recently known as Spoornet) is the division of Transnet that runs the rail system.Spoornet history Though there are no plans to end government-ownership of the national rail network, some small portions of the rail system have recently been privatised.South Africa :: Railways and roads ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia  Network  The rail network of South Africa Transnet (and previously Spoornet and its predecessor) became famous for its luxury rail lines, most notably the Blue Train, which runs from Cape Town to Pretoria. The Blue Train has frequently been named the best luxury train line in the world, and the run is a popular tourist attraction for South Africa. With the increasing coverage provided by the nation's highway system, long-distance passenger travel has declined in South Africa. While many commuters still use rail for their daily commute, nationally, only half of the nation's of track is being fully utilised, and some 35% of the nation's track carries no activity or very low activity. Accordingly, Transnet is moving towards an emphasis on freight, rather than passengers, to keep the rail system profitable. For a look at the South African transport network, including the railways, view this map from the United Nations. A high-speed rail link has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.  Maps  * UN Map * UNHCR map  Specifications  Nearly all railways in South Africa use a Cape gauge track. This was selected in the 19th century to reduce the cost of building track across and through the mountains found in several parts of the country. The Gautrain rapid transit railway uses (standard gauge). During the late 19th century and the early 20th century numerous 2-foot narrow gauge railways were constructed. South African trains connect through the AAR coupler, developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century. Remarkably, though South Africa has long been ahead of Europe in coupling systems, it has lagged behind most of the world in its braking system; most trains in South Africa continue to use vacuum braking. However, the conversion to air brakes has finally commenced. Between 50% to 80% of the rail lines in South Africa are electrified. Different voltages are used for different types of trains. Most electrified trains run 3000 V DC (overhead); this is used primarily for commuter lines, and has been in use since the 1920s. During the 1980s, higher voltages (25 kV AC and‚Äîmuch less frequently‚Äî50 kV AC (both overhead) have been used for heavy duty lines (which also require more sleepers per kilometer) primarily used for the transport of iron ore.  Rolling stock  South Africa uses a variety of rolling stock from a number of manufacturers. In 1957 Union Carriage & Wagon was founded in Nigel for local production of rolling stock.

During a decade of industrial unrest, the Grunwick dispute became a cause c√©l√®bre of trade unionism and labour relations law, and \\"at its height involved thousands of trade unionists and police in confrontations, ...over 500 arrests on the picket line and Socialist Workers Party (UK) and police violence.\\" The total of 550 arrests made during the strike was at the time the highest such figure in any industrial dispute since the General Strike of 1926. Journalist Paul Foot described the dispute as \\"a central battleground between the classes and between the parties.\\" The dispute was reported nightly on the national television news, depicting the often violent clashes between the supporters of the strikers and the Metropolitan Police's Special Patrol Group. Grunwick was the first time that this paramilitary police unit had been deployed in an industrial dispute. The mostly female, immigrant, East African Asian strikers ‚Äì dubbed \\"strikers in saris\\" by the news media ‚Äì were led by Jayaben Desai, whose membership of the union was later suspended following her hunger strike outside the Trades Union Congress (TUC) headquarters in November 1977. This was also the first dispute where the majority of strikers were from an ethnic minority and still received widespread support from the labour movement ‚Äì previous disputes involving immigrant workers which had taken place in Leicester and Southall had \\"remained marginalised\\" and had even led to \\"open and ugly racism on the part of white union members and their leaders.\\" Reprinted at libcom.org. The incumbent Labour government commissioned the Scarman Inquiry, chaired by Lord Scarman, which recommended both union recognition and re-instatement of the workers, but the employer, backed by the right-wing National Association For Freedom (NAFF) and the Conservative Party, rejected the recommendations. The TUC subsequently withdrew their support and the workers' strike committee announced the end of the dispute in June 1978. The repercussions of the strike for British industrial relations were far-reaching, significantly weakening the British trades union movement. The Conservative Party and other members of the right wing saw this as a major political and ideological victory, preparing the ground for Conservative success in the 1979 general election and their subsequent curbing of the unions' power in the 1980s. Background Grunwick Film Processing Laboratories was a photographic finishing and processing business, trading under a variety of brand names including Bonusprint, Doubleprint and Tripleprint, founded in 1965 by George Ward, John Hickey and Tony Grundy. At the time of the dispute, the firm operated on a postal basis, in which customers mailed undeveloped films and payment to the laboratory and received finished photographs back through the postal service. The growth of amateur colour photography meant that small High Street chemists which had previously serviced this market \\"could no longer afford the equipment to develop family snapshots, and the photo-processing field was left wide open for larger, specialist companies\\" such as Grunwick. In 1973, there had been a previous dispute over union recognition at Grunwick, and a number of workers who joined the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) were subsequently laid off. Shirley Williams described it as employing \\"a great many Asian women on fairly long hours and pretty low wages\\" ‚Äì the average pay at Grunwick was ¬£28 per week while the average national wage was ¬£72 per week and the average full-time wage for a female manual worker in London was ¬£44 per week. Overtime was compulsory and often no prior notice would be given. Of the company's 440 employees, 80% were of Asian origin and 10% of Afro- Caribbean origin, and application forms for employment at Grunwick asked for passport numbers and \\"date of arrival in the UK.\\" The MP for Brent South, Laurence Pavitt, said that in his dealings with the company over \\"many years\\" prior to the dispute, the management had been rude and intransigent, failing to respond to his letters, and treated the workers in a \\"deplorable fashion.\\" MP Joe Ashton accused the firm of \\"exploiting coloured workers\\", and writer and political activist Amrit Wilson asserted that Grunwick's management \\"made use of the poverty of Asians\\" and would turn away non-Asian applicants. Grunwick strikers explained: \\"Imagine how humiliating it was for us, particularly for older women, to be working and to overhear the employer saying to a younger, English girl 'you don't want to come and work here, love, we won't be able to pay the sort of wages that'll keep you here' ‚Äì while we had to work there because we were trapped.\\" Jayaben Desai said: \\"The strike is not so much about pay, it is a strike about human dignity.\\" The 1977 Scarman Inquiry would ultimately conclude that \\"physical working conditions in the company before the strike were good; although the rates of pay were low prior to the strike, the company increased financial benefits paid to workers in November 1976 and April 1977 [until] the rates of pay were broadly comparable with, and in some respects, slightly better than, those paid by comparable firms in the industry... and employees understood and accepted the requirement of compulsory overtime during busy periods.\\" A claim by the Socialist Workers Party alleging that Grunwick was a \\"racist\\" employer was also later withdrawn as \\"completely untrue and unfair\\". In fact, George Ward was himself of Anglo- Indian extraction born in New Delhi in 1933, the son of a wealthy accountant - although this in itself does not preclude his actions being motivated by institutional racism and the belief that Indian workers should be paid less by virtue of their race. Although there were allegations that the working conditions at Grunwick resembled those of a sweatshop, other contemporary writers described the premises as \\"clean and well lit but frugal.\\" However, the dispute began during the hottest summer in the UK since records began, when the air-conditioning at the premises was not then in operation, and no allowance was made for this in terms of the employees' productivity. Strike =Dismissals= The strike was sparked by the dismissal of Devshi Bhudia, at the firm's Chapter Road premises, on Friday 20 August 1976 for working too slowly. Three others, Chandrakant Patel, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia, walked out in support of him. At 6:55pm Jayaben Desai put on her coat to leave and was called into the office, where she was dismissed for doing so. Her son Sunil walked out in support of her. On 23 August 1976 the six began picketing outside Grunwick, and were advised by the Citizens Advice Bureau to contact a trade union to represent them. They were then advised by the TUC to contact APEX, the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff, described by Shirley Williams, who was at the time sponsored by APEX, as \\"famous throughout the trade union movement as the most determinedly moderate and fundamentally anti-communist union of them all.\\" Others called it the \\"least dynamic and most right-wing of trade unions\\", and pointed out that as a \\"white-collar\\" union it was not well-disposed to draw upon support from its members, often \\"isolated groups of workers\\" employed in small offices. =ACAS involvement= Having signed up as members of APEX, the pickets returned to Grunwick where 50 more workers walked out demanding the right to join the union. The pickets also headed to Grunwick's nearby Cobbold Road premises where a further 25 workers walked out and joined the strike. According to APEX's subsequent testimony at the Scarman Inquiry, their grievance with the company consisted of \\"low pay, long hours with compulsory overtime, petty restrictions imposed on working people, a bullying attitude on the part of supervision, and frequent dismissals and threats of dismissals,\\" leading to \\"the expressed intention of bringing in trade union representation.\\" On 24 August 1976 Grunwick made an offer to reinstate all striking employees if they dropped their demand for union representation, which was rejected. On 2 September 1976 all 137 striking workers were dismissed from the company's employ. In the intervening period, APEX had declared the strike \\"official\\" and sought a meeting with Grunwick management, as did, informally, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). The company refused to meet with APEX or ACAS. On 5 September 1976 the general secretary of APEX, Roy Grantham, requested that the Secretary of State for Employment, Albert Booth, establish a court of inquiry into the dispute. On 7 September Grantham addressed the TUC's Annual Congress regarding the Grunwick dispute. As a result, on 7 October 1976 Len Murray, General Secretary of the TUC, requested trade unions give \\"all possible assistance\\" to the strikers, including \\"boycotting Grunwick's services.\\" Acting on the advice of Albert Booth, on 15 October 1976 APEX formally requested ACAS to take up the case under section 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975 (c.71). =Union of Post Office Workers' boycott= When the strike began, members of the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) refused to cross the picket line to deliver mail, but allowed representatives of the firm to collect it from the local sorting office at Cricklewood. This arrangement ended on 1 November, when UPW agreed to stop handling all mail in or out of Grunwick and refused to allow Grunwick staff to collect it themselves. This had an enormous impact on the business, and on 3 November 1976 Ward claimed that the company faced going into liquidation at the end of the week if the mail continued to be withheld. Ward received backing from his local Conservative MP, John Gorst, who called for an emergency debate about the matter in the House of Commons. Backed by Gorst and NAFF, Ward threatened to take legal action against the UPW in the High Court, claiming the actions of its members was in direct contradiction to the provisions of section 58 of the Post Office Act 1953, which said that any officer of the Post Office who \\"wilfully fails to handle mail\\" would be guilty of a misdemeanour. Tom Jackson, the General Secretary of the UPW, responded that \\"The Post Office Act was written many years ago and it has never been tested in relation to sympathetic industrial action. Until it is, as far as our union is concerned, we are going to support these workers who are being badly treated by a nineteenth-century employer.\\" The Act was not considered by observers to be as effective as Ward and Gorst believed, and had not been used by the Conservative government during the seven-week-long national Post Office strike in 1971. On 4 November Ward agreed to meet ACAS in return for UPW calling off its boycott, and following talks between APEX and UPW Grunwick staff were once more allowed to collect mail from the sorting office. Ward still applied for an ex parte injunction against both the Post Office and the UPW on 5 November, which was refused by Mr. Justice Chapman in the High Court. Usually, a party moves ex parte to prevent an adversary from having notice of their intentions. At a second inter partes hearing before Mr. Justice Slynn on 9 November, the firm consented to the dismissal of its application for an injunction. =Definition of \\"worker\\"= ACAS were empowered by section 11 of the Employment Protection Act (EPA) to \\"ascertain the opinions of workers to whom the issue relates\\", but Grunwick, backed by NAFF, disputed that the strikers should be included, on the grounds that they had been dismissed and so were no longer \\"workers\\" of the company. John Stacey, Grunwick's personnel manager, said \\"The truth is that we do not care what their opinions are.\\" In the meantime, the company awarded a 15% pay rise to non-striking workers on the understanding that they would not join the union. In response, UPW said it would consider resuming its boycott of Grunwick if the firm would not co- operate with ACAS. Harold Walker, the Minister of State for Employment, also urged Grunwick to co-operate with ACAS to end the dispute and criticised the involvement of NAFF, saying that this was not the first time that this \\"ultra right wing political organisation [had] sought to interfere in industrial disputes, with harmful consequences.\\" Grunwick would not turn over the names and addresses of those still working to ACAS, or allow them access to the workers, saying that it would only do so if their opinions were canvassed while those of the strikers were not taken into consideration. The company explained \\"We are bound by the opinion of the loyal workers inside our company\\" and would not heed those of the strikers \\"outside\\". The draft report prepared by ACAS, who had been unable to canvass all of the workers, recommended recognition of APEX by Grunwick for negotiation purposes. Grunwick responded to the draft by seeking legal advice to challenge the recommendation, centred on the definition of \\"worker\\". The union maintained that if Grunwick's submission was proved in law, it would render the employment provisions of the EPA meaningless and create a legal loophole whereby employers could \\"dismiss with impunity workers who asked for recognition.\\" On 18 April 1977 the company served a writ of ultra vires on ACAS, alleging that it had exceeded its authority by canvassing the opinions of the strikers. The case was heard during June‚ÄìJuly 1977. In his judgement, delivered 12 July 1977, Lord Widgery, the Lord Chief Justice, dismissed the claim by Grunwick that the ACAS report should be declared void. Lord Widgery said that ACAS had \\"made all reasonably practicable efforts to canvass staff opinion\\", but had been prevented speaking to all employees as Grunwick had deliberately withheld their names and addresses. He said \\"I am satisfied that Mr. Ward could have supplied these lists at any time but declined to do so in the belief that he could thereby exercise some control over the proceedings.\\" He also \\"rejected Grunwick's contention that the dismissed strikers could no longer be legally recognized as workers concerned with the dispute.\\" Grunwick were ordered to pay costs, in the region of ¬£7,000, to APEX and ACAS. Ward stated that he would refer the case to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard by the Master of the Rolls Lord Denning, Lord Justice Browne and Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane on 29 July 1977. While Lord Justices Browne and Lane disagreed with Lord Denning's decision that strikers were not \\"workers\\", all three were in agreement that the failure of ACAS to canvass all of the employees, even though it was through no fault of their own, rendered the report invalid and as such it was declared void. While accepting that ACAS had made all the efforts that it could to ascertain the opinions of the workers inside Grunwick, the failure to do so meant that it had \\"not complied with the conditions and safeguards of section 14 of the Act.\\" ACAS said that it would appeal the decision, which had effectively made the Act unworkable where an employer refuses to co-operate. The subsequent appeal was heard before Lords Diplock, Salmon, Edmund-Davies, Fraser and Keith, who dismissed it on 14 December 1977. =Extension of picketing= By March 1977, picketing had also begun outside London chemists' shops in an effort to stop them doing business with Grunwick. Grunwick attempted to take out an injunction restraining pickets from demonstrating outside shops and handing out what the company alleged were \\"defamatory leaflets\\". In the High Court Mr Justice Gibson refused to grant the injunction, saying that he would not interfere with peaceful picketing in a trade dispute. The company was unable to provide evidence of violence by the pickets, and as the strike committee claimed that they could justify their allegations in a court of law the judge declined to restrain the distribution of leaflets. Mass pickets The dispute, and the attendant media coverage, became far more heated for a few weeks in June and July 1977 when mass-pickets formed of trade unionists and supporters from across London tried to stop non-striking Grunwick workers from entering the workplace. Police responded with greater numbers and more aggressive tactics, and violence broke out on a number of occasions. The local Brent Trades Council, led by its president, veteran construction union activist and Communist Party industrial organiser Tom Durkin, and its secretary, TGWU activist Jack Dromey, had become increasingly active in support of the strikers, mobilising support from other trades councils, trade unions and other labour movement bodies across Greater London. From the spring of 1977 this had led to delegations of trade unionists from other parts of London starting to attend at and support the picket lines and the Grunwick management and the police had responded by preventing pickets from having any contact with workers entering the factory. In the summer the strike committee, supported by the trades council, decided to call mass-pickets in an attempt to prevent buses carrying non-striking workers entering the Grunwick premises and a mass-picket and demonstration was called for 22 June 1977. This mobilisation call was vigorously taken up by several trade union and labour movement bodies across London and by virtually all leftist political organisations (notably the Communist Party and its newspaper, the Morning Star, the Socialist Workers' Party and various political groups inside the Labour Party). The 22 June event became a national demonstration of solidarity with the Grunwick strikers. On 22 June delegations from trades councils, several constituency Labour parties and a great many trade unions (including miners and print workers) attended the mass-picket. The attendance of the president of the Yorkshire area of the National Union of Mineworkers, Arthur Scargill, and a delegation of mineworkers from as far afield as Yorkshire, South Wales and Kent, was highlighted by the media. There were clashes between police and pickets (and a large number of arrests) when police tried to escort buses carrying non-striking employees into the Grunwick plant and bloody scenes between the police and the pickets were broadcast on television. The Labour government decided to commission an inquiry under Lord Scarman and the pickets were called off in mid-July to wait for the result of the inquiry. APEX announced it would abide by the outcome of the inquiry but Ward did not, saying he would only submit to the normal courts. Aftermath The Scarman Inquiry recommended the reinstatement of the strikers, said that the management had acted \\"within the letter but outside the spirit of the law\\" and that union recognition could \\"help the company as well as the employees\\". Ward rejected the report, the strikers were not reinstated and the union was not recognised. A House of Lords ruling upheld Ward's right not to recognise a union. The strike's support from other unions \\"slipped away\\" leaving the strikers to call off their action on 14 July 1978, nearly two years after it had begun. Their demands for collective bargaining were never met. A 2016 BBC radio documentary, Grunwick Changed Me, described how the involvement of white, working class men in support of Asian women strikers was seen as a turning point in race relations in the United Kingdom. Political involvement Three ministers in the Labour Government who were sponsored by APEX, Shirley Williams, Denis Howell and Fred Mulley, joined the picket line at Grunwick on 19 May 1977; at the time the picket was \\"relatively small and peaceful\\". Williams, who was generally known as a moderate, subsequently lost her seat at the 1979 general election and the novelist Kingsley Amis commented that \\"I bet she rued the day she turned up on the Grunwick picket line\\". Postmen who refused to deliver Grunwick's mail were suspended, disrupting postal service in the area, and the Attorney General refused to initiate any action against them and stopped anyone else from doing so. In August 1977 Sir Keith Joseph, a prominent Conservative politician called the Grunwick dispute \\"a make-or-break point for British democracy, the freedoms of ordinary men and women\\" and described Labour ministers who joined the pickets as \\"'[m]oderates' behind whom Red Fascism spreads\\". Joseph was seen as speaking beyond his remit, as the more moderate James Prior was the shadow Employment Secretary. The Tory Reform Group called Joseph \\"off his head\\" and Thatcher said his comments were \\"too sharp\\".

He is known as one of the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan and was the nephew of the two leading figures, Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami. Family lineage The former seven generations of Jiva Goswami according to Bhakti-ratnakara: Sarvajna Jagatguru was a famous brahmana, great scholar in all Vedas, respected Yajur-vedi of the Baradvaja caste, and king of Karnataka, adored by all other contemporary kings. Sarvajna's son, Aniruddha, was spirited, famous, a proficient scholar of the Vedas, and a favorite of the reigning kings at the time. Aniruddha's sons, Rupesvara (eldest) and Harihara, were well respected due to their virtuous qualities. Rupesvara was famed as a scholar of the scriptures, while Harihara became a master in the art and science of weapons. Both brothers inherited the administration of the state after their father died, but Harihara soon snatched all the power, causing Rupesvara and his wife to travel to Paulastha- desa, where Sikharesvara befriended him and convinced him to settle there. Rupesvara's son, Padmanabha, was a genius and easily learned the four Vedas making him famous. He had impeccable character and was genuinely absorbed in love of Lord Jagannatha. He left Sikharabhumi and settled on the bank of the Ganges in the village Navahatta (present-day Naihati, West Bengal, India), where he had eighteen daughters and five sons. His five sons were Purusottama (eldest), Jagannatha, Narayana, Murari, and Mukunda (youngest), where Purusottama and Mukunda were the best in experience and character. Mukunda's son, Kumara, was a great brahmana and highly virtuous. He privately engaged in oblations and purificatory penances. Becoming very disturbed by family difficulties, he left the village Navahatta with his followers and settled in the village Bakla Chandradvipa in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). He built a house in the village Fateyabad in Jessore for the convenience of communications with devotees and traveling Vaishnavas. Among Kumara's many sons, Sanatana (eldest), Rupa (middle), and Vallabha (youngest) were the life of the Vaishnava community and great devotees, all three becoming well known for their academic genius and devotion, and eventually settling in the village Ramakeli in Gauda. Vallabha's son, Jiva Goswami, was very talented, completing his studies in vyakarana and other subjects within a very short time, grasping vast spiritual knowledge with a sincere and devotional endeavor. Jiva avoided activities that had no connection with Krishna. He never married and remained celibate. His pleased uncles treated him affectionately. The brothers and Jiva were all greatly inspired by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who lived in Nadia (a district of present-day West Bengal, India) at the time. Sanatana and Rupa eventually resigned from their ministerial (royal) posts and retired to help Chaitanya in his mission, eventually relocating to Vrindavana. Jiva was also attracted to Vrindavana and his uncles there, which caused Jiva to eventually renounce material life and join his uncles in their mission. On the way to join his uncles in Vrindavana, he first met with Nityananda Prabhu in Nabadwip for a few days, then studied from Madhusudana Vacaspati in Kasi and became expert in Nyaya Vedanta and other scriptures. Vallabha, who was always happy in service, was initiated by Chaitanya and given the name Anupama, and was known for his stoicism and neutrality in his detachment from worldly affairs. Birth and early years There seems to be some controversy amongst biographers about Jiva Goswami's birth. Some opine that he lived from 1511‚Äì1596 CE, while others claim that he lived from 1533 to 1618 CE. Not much is known about Jiva Goswami's childhood. He was born in Ramakeli in the district of Maldah, West Bengal as the son of Srivallabha Mallika (also known as Anupama), the younger brother of Rupa and Sanatana; his mother's name is unknown. He had a strong affinity to the worship of Krishna even from his childhood and excelled in his education completing his studies in Sanskrit Vyakarana (grammar) and Kavya (poetics) within a very short period. When Jiva was three or four years old, his uncles resigned from their ministerial posts at the court of Alauddin Hussein Shah (ruled 1493‚Äì1519 CE) after their initial meeting with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486‚Äì1534 CE) and they decided to join his ranks as mendicants. Jiva's father, Anupama, also met with Chaitanya at this time and followed in the footsteps of his elder brothers and proceeded to travel with Rupa to Vrindavana. Jiva leaves home Hearing that his father and uncles had made their decision to work in the service of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the young Jiva desired to join them also. According to the biographical work Bhakti Ratnakara of Narahari Chakravarti, Jiva had a dream of Chaitanya at this time. This gave him the impetus to leave home and join Rupa and Sanatana. It is unclear from his biographies whether or not Jiva actually ever met Chaitanya personally. Jiva travelled to Navadvipa in West Bengal and met with Nityananda Rama, one of the foremost associate of Chaitanya mahaprabhu. Nityananda took Jiva to all the holy places in Navadvipa and they circumambulated the entire area together. This marked the beginning of the Gaudiya tradition of Navadvipa parikrama (circumambulation of the nine sections of Navadvipa). After the pilgrimage, Nityananda gave his blessings for the young Jiva to proceed towards Vrindavana. Vrindavana Jiva went on to Benares where he studied for some time under the tutelage of Madhusudana Vachaspati, the disciple of the famous logician and Vedantist, Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya. Under Vachaspati, Jiva mastered the six systems of Indian philosophy known as Sad Darsana. In 1535 Jiva arrived in Vrindavana where he remained under the tutelage of his uncles, Rupa and Sanatana (by this time his father Anupama had died). He accepted initiation from Rupa Goswami and was taught the esoteric principles of devotion to Krishna. Jiva helped to edit the writings of Rupa and Sanatana and assisted them in their work in propagating Gaudiya Vaishnavism and excavating the lost holy places of Vrindavana. Literary contributions After the passing of Rupa and Sanatana, Jiva Goswami became the foremost authority in the Gaudiya Vaishnava line. In 1542 Jiva established one of the prominent and important temples in the Vrindavana area, the Radha Damodara mandir, installing deities of Radha and Krishna that had been personally carved by Rupa Goswami. At that time he also established the Vishva Vaishnava Raja Sabha (World Vaishnava Association) and the Rupanuga Vidyapitha, an educational facility for Gaudiya Vaishnavas to study the works of Rupa and Sanatana. His erudition and spirituality were so famous that the Moghul emperor Akbar became his ardent admirer and donated paper for his writing. In 1558, Jiva instructed his students, Narottama Dasa, Srinivasa Acarya and Shyamananda, to go to Bengal and propagate the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy and to take with them the original manuscripts that had been written by Rupa and Sanatana. One of Jiva‚Äôs main theological contributions was to present Chaitanya‚Äôs teachings as ‚Äúthe epitome of the Vedas.‚Äù To do so, Jiva should claim that the Bhagavata Purana, which Chaitanya regarded as the key Hindu scripture, was indeed part of the Vedas, while it was not generally considered as ‚Äúpart of the canonical Veda‚Äù at that time. Jiva proceeded to ‚Äúextend the scope of the Veda to include the epics and the PurƒÅnas,‚Äù and concluded that the Bhagavata Purana was ‚Äúscripture par excellence‚Äù. In fact, he shifted ‚Äúthe locus of scriptural authority from the Veda to the BhƒÅgavata,‚Äù which had important, if controversial, consequences for the subsequent development of Hindu theology.Aleksandar Uskokov, ‚ÄúThe Long and Short of It: MahƒÅ-vƒÅkya from Mƒ´mƒÅmsƒÅ to Jƒ´va GosvƒÅmin, from the Veda to the BhƒÅgavata,‚Äù The Journal of Hindu Studies 11 (2018):38‚Äì52 (41‚Äì43). Jiva's disappearance Jiva Goswami left this mortal world and ascended back to the spiritual planet, Golok Vrindavana in 1596 CE (or 1618 according to some biographies). His samƒÅdhi (tomb) is located in the precincts of the Radha-Damodara temple in Vrindavana. According to followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Jiva Goswami is considered to be the incarnation of Vilasa Manjari, an eternal maidservant of Radharani. Achintya-bhedabheda philosophy It was in his Sarva-samvadini commentary to the Sat Sandarbhas of Hindu philosophy that Jiva Goswami first wrote of Achintya Bheda Abheda, the philosophy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In essence, the philosophy of Achintya bheda abheda, or \\"inconceivable oneness and difference\\", avoids the extremes of Shankara's monistic Advaita vedanta and Madhva's pure dualism (Dvaita) by interpreting the material and spiritual potencies of the Supreme Person (Bhagavan) as being simultaneously one and different with Him. Bibliography There are at least 25 literary works attributed to Jiva Goswami,Gaudiya Touchstone magazine: Issue No. 6, pp. 125-127. which can be classified into four types: treatises, commentaries, grammar and rhetoric, and poetry, with the best-known in each category being Sat-sandarbhas, Durgama-sangamani, Hari-namamrita-vyakarana and Gopalachampu, respectively. =Treatises= Sat-sandarbhas , Bhagavata-sandarbha : Sometimes called the Bhagavata-sandarbha, not to be confused with the second treatise titled Bhagavat-sandarbha, where \\"sandarbha\\" literally means \\"weaving\\" or \\"arranging\\". Sandarbhas are a thematic arrangement of the Bhagavata Purana presenting Caitanya Vaishnavism in a systematic and comprehensive way. Intensely theological, this work is considered the most important among all his works. According to Jiva Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami completed the preliminary work, but couldn't finish it. Jiva Goswami expanded it into six books, wherein he systematically presents the philosophy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu with scriptural evidences. # Tattva-Sandarbha: A treatise on the various types of evidences (pramanas) used in Vedic philosophy, concluding that shabda (divine sound in the form of the Vedic scriptures) is the highest, and of all the scriptures, the Bhagavata Purana is the highest pointing to the Absolute Truth. # Bhagavat-sandarbha: Distinguishes the impersonal aspect of Godhead (Brahman), the localized form of God within the heart of each living being (Paramatma), and the highest personal aspect of Godhead (Krishna or Bhagavan). Describes the spiritual realm of Krishna, the modes of material nature, the mode of pure goodness (visuddha-sattva), the importance of worshiping the deity of Krishna, and the eternal nature and qualities of the deity. # Paramatma-sandarbha : Describes the characteristics of Paramatma (supersoul), and how he resides in all living entities in the universe. Discusses the nature of the materially conditioned living entities, the phenomenal material world, the illusory potency (maya), the theory of transformation, the various avatars of Krishna, how Krishna reciprocates with his devotees, and how Krishna is characterized by six particular opulences. # Krishna-sandarbha : Gives a number of quotes from various scriptures to prove that Krishna is the supreme god. Discusses the pastimes and qualities of Krishna as well as his avatars and functionary expansions. There is a description of Goloka, the planet of Krishna in relation to Vrindavana in the material sphere, the eternal associates of Krishna and their expansions, and a description of the Gopis and the topmost position of Radha among them. # Bhakti-sandarbha: Explains how devotion to Krishna is directly executed, how the self is manifest through bhakti, the potency of imperfectly executed bhakti, the differences between a great and ordinary devotee, spontaneous love of god (raganuga-bhakti), the specific purpose of becoming a devotee of Krishna, and other perfectional stages. Discusses varnashrama dharma (the socio-religious system established in scriptures), the superexcellent position of devotion to Krishna as compared to other conceptions such as yoga, and the worship of minor deities of the Hindu pantheon as being futile in comparison to the worship of Krishna's devotees. Explains liberation of the soul, the position of Shiva as a devotee of Krishna, how unmotivated devotion to Krishna promotes a devotee to the highest spiritual position and numerous other points concerning the performance of Vaishnava devotion. # Priti-sandarbha : A treatise on divine love, the supreme object being Krishna, where love for God (prema) is considered the highest form of liberation. Presents a comparative study of other types of liberation, concluding prema bhakti as topmost. Discusses how to attain prema, how to awaken it, and the symptoms of one who has attained it. Discusses the distinctions between mundane lust and divine love, the various mellows found among the associates of Krishna, the superexcellence of madhurya-rasa (divine conjugal love), the overlapping of different rasas, and the glories of Radha.

It was established as an educational charity in 1996 and is now part of Historic Environment Scotland, a registered charity and non-departmental government body. General description Scran works in partnership with over 300 cultural institutions in Scotland and the rest of the UK who contribute material to the online service. The online learning resource service hosts nearly 490,000 images, movies and sounds from museums, galleries, archives and the media. Subscribers can download and reuse these for personal and educational use in accordance with the subscriber licence.

This was Millennium Commission funded through the UK Lottery. It developed an advanced licensing system, commended by many, in which the institution retained ownership of the digitised assets, but made these available under licence to Scran. There followed further large grant aid partner projects with NOF Digitise funding through the National Library of Scotland. =Recent work= Scran continues to add records to its database from institutions and individuals. Technical innovations include \\"Create\\" functions that allow user creation of instant documents, the ability for users to save their favourite records to a password-protected \\"Stuff\\" account and share these with other Scran users, mapping functions and enhanced cross searching such as SRU/SRW.

Mirsky graduated from Harvard College in 1922, after which he studied for two years at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons until 1924 when he moved to the University of Cambridge on a US National Research Council fellowship for the academic year 1924‚Äì1925. He received his PhD from Cambridge in 1926, with a dissertation under Lawrence J. Henderson on the Haemoglobin molecule, completing work begun under Joseph Barcroft. On May 25, 1926 Mirsky married Reba Paeff, who went on to become a renowned children's author; they had a daughter, Reba Goodman and a son, Jonathan Mirsky. In 1927 Mirsky was appointed Lab Assistant to Alfred E. Cohn at the then Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, beginning his association with Rockefeller University. During a sabbatical year at the California Institute of Technology, Mirsky published a paper with Linus Pauling on the general theory of protein structure, suggesting that the structure of proteins are coiled in a specific configuration that accounts for the function in the body, and that the protein is denatured when that configuration is lost by breaking the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the structure. One of Mirsky's more notorious contributions while at the Rockefeller Institute was his attempt to discredit Oswald Avery. Avery had correctly shown that DNA was likely the agent of heredity. However, Mirsky went to great lengths to block Avery's discovery because of doubts that DNA was the sole genetic material. It is said he even urged the Karolinska Institute in Sweden not to award Avery the Nobel Prize. Eventually Mirsky's efforts were successful. Avery did not win the prize, despite as Erwin Chargaff claims, Avery's work was worth two Nobel Prizes. Mirsky became an official Member of the Rockefeller Institute in 1948, and in 1950 was internationally congratulated for the \\"grand discovery\\" of DNA constancy, which proved the concept of DNA as the hereditary material. He served as an editor of The Journal of General Physiology in 1951‚Äì1961. Mirsky was made Professor in 1954 when the Institute became Rockefeller University. He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in the same year. Mirsky was highly involved in university affairs, and in 1959 he initiated a series of lectures for high school students, now named the Alfred E. Mirsky Holiday Lecture on Science in his honour. In 1962 Mirsky chose a new lab assistant from a pool of candidates, in choosing a woman, Ellie Donoghue, he set a precedent by making her the first female lab assistant in the Institute's history, the very same position which he first held upon his initial association with Rockefeller Institute. Mirsky proceeded to entrust Ms. Donoghue with assistance in his research and the running of his laboratory, setting an early precedent for the advancement of women in the labs at Rockefeller University. Following retirement from his laboratory in an official capacity in 1964, he served as librarian of the Rockefeller University from 1965 until 1972, all the while being allowed to maintain his laboratory at the university for his personal research. He continued to make groundbreaking contributions to the study of cell nuclei in rodents and bovines in direct parallels to the structure of cell nuclei in humans. After his wife, Reba Paeff Mirsky, died in 1966 he donated her valuable jewelry collection, save for a few pieces distributed to family and close friends, to the university's collection. This collection of jewelry, acquired during their many trips around the world, is a part of the university's holdings to this day. He went on to marry fellow Rockefeller employee Sonia Wohl in 1967. Mirsky became professor emeritus in 1971, after forty-four years at the Rockefeller Institute and University. Mirsky traveled widely and was quite knowledgeable in archaeology and art history; his priceless collection of art and historical objects was willed to the Rockefeller University upon his death in 1974 and remains in their permanent collection.

Military mail systems are often subsidized to ensure that military mail does not cost the sender any more than normal domestic mail. In some cases, military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and packages to their home country for free. Modern military mail services are provided by most armed forces around the world. In some nations, individual service branches may run their own military mail program. History Early forms of military mail may go back to the dawn of civilization. There is some evidence of it dating back to Ancient Egypt of the 2nd millennium BC. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle make mention of messengers being sent by King Edward the Elder (899-924) to recall members of the Kent fyrd, but it is generally regarded that the origins of the postal services stem from the King's Messengers (Nuncii et Cursores) of medieval times, in particular, the Royal Post established in the reign of King Edward IV (1461‚Äì83) to support his troops engaged in a war against Scotland. =Beginnings= Clerks organising mail at a post office in London, circa 1808 In 1795, Parliament granted the penny postage concession to soldiers and sailors of the British Army and Royal Navy. Four years later, in 1799, the Duke of York appointed Henry Darlot, an ‚Äòintelligent clerk‚Äô from the General Post Office (GPO) as the Army Postmaster to accompany his expedition to Helder. Thomas Reynolds, as the British Post Office Agent in Lisbon, Portugal was made responsible for coordinating the exchange of the British Army‚Äôs mails at the port during the Peninsular War (1809‚Äì14). Two Sergeant Postmasters were appointed to work with Reynolds. The sergeants reported to the Duke of Wellington‚Äôs the Superintendent of Military Communications, Major Scovell and later Lieutenant Colonel Sturgeon. After complaints about the mail services to the British troops fighting in the Crimean War (1854‚Äì56) the Postmaster General authorised the secondment of GPO staff to organise and distribute mail in the theatre of war. A Base Army Post Office was established in Constantinople and a field post Office with the Army Headquarters at Balaklava. A regular seaborne mail service was established between Varna and Constantinople. In response to demands made by Florence Nightingale, a method of transmitting money was devised to allow troops to transfer monies back to their families at home in the United Kingdom. This was designed to prevent drunkenness and became the world's first International Money Order Service. In its first month of operation ¬£7,000 was remitted by the British troops. =Modern military mail provision= Bombardment of Alexandria, 1882. The first dedicated postal service to an army in the field was established during this campaign. The military postal experience of the Crimea and the lessons learnt from the Indian Army encouraged the British Army to seriously review the arrangements for the provision of a postal service to the troops in the field. There were two opinions; firstly, that the Army run its own services as in the Peninsular War. Secondly, that civilians from the Post Office be responsible for the service as in the Crimean and Indian Army example. The provision of a mail service to soldiers remained an ad hoc affair until 1882. In 1881 a rebellion broke out in Egypt which threatened Britain's passage to India through Suez. In response a British Expeditionary Force was sent to Egypt in the same year under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley. This gave Lieutenant Colonel du Plat Taylor the opportunity to raise the matter of the postal corps again and it was agreed that an Army Post Office Corps (APOC) should be formed. Mails from Britain were despatched three times a week via the 'overland route' through France to Alexandria. The Army Post Offices offered a letter and parcel service and sold stamps and postal orders. In addition to the mail services, a free parcel service from the naval docks at Deptford was also set up. These parcels travelled by government store ships and transports. This service was the forerunner of the Military Forwarding Office (MFO) service which still exists today. The expedition was a success and set the basis for the institution of military mail, both in England and around the world. The unit received high praise from the commander-in-chief, who wrote: At the end of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), the Royal Engineers (Postal Section), along with the Royal Air Force (RAF), helped to pioneer international airmail services, by setting up airmail routes between Folkestone, England and Cologne, Germany to service the British Army of the Rhine. Selected modern services =British Forces Post Office (BFPO)= A British Wilding series postage stamp used at a BFPO on Christmas Island in 1957 The British Forces Post Office (BFPO) provides a postal service to HM Forces, separate from that provided by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom. BFPO addresses are used for the delivery of mail in the UK and around the world. BFPO is based at RAF Northolt in North West London. Retrieved 18 January 2010. The mission of BFPO is to \\"provide an efficient and effective Postal and Courier Service to sustain the fighting power of UK Armed Forces Worldwide.\\" Retrieved 18 January 2010. When sending mail from the UK to a member of HM Forces serving overseas, the sender must address it to the appropriate BFPO number, not to the country in which that person is based. In 2012, in collaboration with Royal Mail, the BFPO introduced UK-style postcodes to help ordering items online because of problems with websites not recognising the BFPO addressing format. The addresses are assigned to the notional post town \\"BFPO\\", and as of 2012, all postcodes begin with \\"BF1\\". =German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr)= The Bundeswehr's military mail system is known in German as Feldpost; all mail to or from missions abroad is sent to Darmstadt (near Frankfurt am Main), where outbound mail is sent via land or air to the Bundeswehr's overseas stations, and inbound mail is dispatched to German domestic addresses, or to foreign destinations. These include Kosovo, Bosnia, and Afghanistan. Feldpost addresses consist of the word \\"Feldpost\\" and a four-digit number beginning with \\"64\\" followed by two additional digits denoting the specific mission (e.g., 6401, etc.). Postal rates for the Feldpost are the same as domestic German postal rates. The Feldpost offers the same service to its customers as the Deutsche Post does within Germany. =Indian Army Postal Service Corps= Largely based on the system followed by the British Indian Army in the 19th century, the Indian Military provides the services of the Army Postal Service Corps which handles the mails for the three defence forces (Army, Navy, Air Force). The Corps however is part of the Indian Army, and is staffed by volunteers from the civilian Indian Postal Service. Mail written to soldiers on field posting do not contain their regular postal address, but their number, rank, name, and Unit number ending with a suffix \\"c/o xxx A.P.O\\". Soldiers are also not allowed to send mails from regular civil Post Offices even if their area of duty has such facilities. For more information, visit the APSC website. =U.S. Military Postal Service (MPS)= 4th Marine Division set up a post office to distribute airdropped mail during the Battle of Iwo Jima. The MPS is required to adhere to United States Postal Service (USPS) rules, federal laws, and various international laws and agreements for movement of military mail into more than 85 countries. The individual military services (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force) are each, themselves, responsible for the costs, manpower, and facilities of mail that travels through their own department. This is why the military services maintains command and control over all military postal assets, both in the United States and abroad. Letter To Home by Stephen H. Randall, U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Artists Team VII (CAT VII 1968) The MPS also supports mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise are available to the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner- or intra-theater delivery service (IDS) as long as it does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to and from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces. MPOs operated or supported by the Army or Air Force use the city abbreviation APO (Army Post Office or Air Force Post Office), while Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps use the city abbreviation FPO (Fleet Post Office). USPS added Diplomatic Post Office (DPO) as a valid overseas address effective January 18, 2009. The city abbreviation is DPO. As of March 2009 there are sixteen U.S. embassy locations known as DPOs. The other approximately ninety overseas U.S. embassy post offices fall under the management oversight of the Services and so are known as either APOs or FPOs.

Originally inspired by the game Wizardry to be a weak and common monster for the video game Dragon Quest, Slime has appeared in almost every Dragon Quest game since. The character's popularity led to the appearance of many varieties of slimes, including boss characters, and even emerging as the protagonist of the Rocket Slime video game series. The Slime has been placed on a multitude of different kinds of merchandise. The Slime's friendliness, limited power, and appealing form have caused the Slime to become a popular character and symbol of the Dragon Quest series. Character design The inspiration for the Slime came to Yuji Horii, the creator of Dragon Quest, from a role-playing game called Wizardry. \\"I was really hooked on 'Wizardy,' the PC game, ... There's...slime-looking characters ..., so I got the inspiration from it. I was doodling the slime-looking character and I took it to Mr. Toriyama, who did the character design, and he made it the Slime we see today.\\" Horii said that when it was originally conceived, the Slime was \\"a pile of goo\\", but Toriyama's design came back as a tear-drop which they considered \\"perfect\\". Attributes =Personality= In most appearances of the Slime, it is an antagonist, and occasionally a boss. In some Dragon Quest titles, slimes also appear as friendly non-player characters and peaceful inhabitants of cities. Friendly slimes usually greet players with the phrase, \\"I'm not a bad slime!\\". Slimes, like many monsters in the Dragon Quest series, have a certain verbal tic, \\"slurp\\". Slimes also replace certain words or syllables with the word \\"goo\\" (e.g. \\"human\\" becomes \\"gooman\\"), or other words relating to slime or goo, when they speak. =Outward appearance= There are many different types of slimes found throughout the Dragon Quest and Rocket Slime series. These include slimes in different colors, bubble slimes, which look like pools of slime, nautical slimes that wear conch shells, the rare metal slimes, which have high defense, give out large amounts of experience points, and tend to flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, gem shaped slimes like the emperor slime, cube shaped box slimes, and king slimes, which are very large slimes wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as regular or metal. Appearances The Slime made its first appearance in Dragon Quest as the first and weakest enemy in the game, and has made a similar appearance in all subsequent Dragon Quest titles. In Dragon Quest V, the monster is an easy recruit that learns a variety of magic spells. The Slime is also the protagonist of its own spinoff series, beginning with Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest, a Japanese Game Boy Advance title. It was followed by Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime, which was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, and the Japanese-exclusive title, Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3 for the Nintendo 3DS. These games follow a nation of slimes who are intelligent and civilized, but also cute and somewhat comical. In the North American localization of the Dragon Quest games for the Nintendo DS, joking references and puns are made about slimes. Slime also appeared in three crossover games along with characters from Nintendo's Mario franchise: Itadaki Street DS, Mario Sports Mix, and Fortune Street. The Slime also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a stage element on Yggdrasil's Altar, a Spirit, and in one of the Hero's taunts and victory poses. Analysis Reviewers have seen the slime as symbolic of the Dragon Quest series in the same way that the Moogle represents Final Fantasy. Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii speculated that the popularity of the slime may come from its cuteness, how it is easy to defeat, and while the protagonists change in every Dragon Quest game, the slime is always there. GamesRadar speculated that the intense \\"grinding\\", or fighting of enemies in the Dragon Quest series exposed players to an abundance of slimes, but a positive association was created by their familiarity. Yoshiki Watabe, producer of Dragon Quest VIII, hypothesized its popularity came from it being a \\"well designed character\\", but \\"simple\\", being accessible to anyone. Cultural impact =Merchandise= As the most recognizable symbol of the best-selling video game series in Japan, the Slime has been featured prominently in Dragon Quest-related merchandise. It has its own section called 'Smile Slime' on the Square Enix JP shopping website. Slime merchandise includes plush toys, pencil cases, keychains, game controllers, a stylus, and several boardgames including one titled Dragon Quest Slime Racing. In Japan, pork filled steam buns shaped like slimes have been sold. For Dragon Quest's 25th anniversary, special items were sold including business cards, tote bags, and crystal figurines. =Reception= The Dragon Quest Slime has received positive reception from critics and fans, being called the \\"most prolific\\" of all the \\"memorable\\" monsters from the series and is one of the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the \\"equivalent of training wheels\\" due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not feel guilty about, the playable role of a Slime in the Dragon Quest Heroes series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that \\"The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do.\\" References Category:Dragon Quest Category:Fictional amorphous creatures Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves Category:Shapeshifter characters in video games Category:Square Enix characters Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters introduced in 1986 Category:Video game mascots Category:Video game species and races Category:Video game characters designed by Akira Toriyama ","title":"Slime (Dragon Quest)"},{"id":"3386547","text":"S√ºkhbaataryn S√ºrenjav (; born May 20, 1951) is a retired Mongolian wrestler.

He is now the 1st team assistant goalkeeping coach Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion. He played three matches for the Denmark national under-21 team. Club career =K√∏ge BK= Born in K√∏ge, Sj√¶lland, Ankergren started playing youth football with Solr√∏d FC,Mikael Koldby, \\"Sofaspil: Solr√∏d FC er klar til kamp\\", Politiken (Copenhagen), 1 July 2000 before moving on to K√∏ge BK in the Danish 1st Division, and represented Denmark at various youth levels. He made a good display in a pre-season friendly against many-times Danish champions Br√∏ndby IF, and was rumoured to be joining that club in April 2000.S√∏ren Olsen, \\"Superligaen: Mogens Kroghs afl√∏ser er fundet\\", Politiken (Copenhagen), 30 April 2000 He signed a contract with Br√∏ndby in May 2000, initially sending him on loan back at K√∏ge.\\"Kroghs afl√∏ser k√∏rt i stilling\\", Ritzaus, 9 May 2000 =Br√∏ndby IF= He eventually joined Br√∏ndby IF in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship in January 2001.S√∏ren Olsen, \\"Superligaen: Tr√¶ngsel i FC K√∏benhavn\\", Politiken (Copenhagen), 4 January 2001 He made his debut in October 2001, and therefore played only one match as Br√∏ndby won the 2001‚Äì02 Superliga title. Ankergren got his breakthrough with Br√∏ndby following the retirement of club legend Mogens Krogh in December 2002. He played all 15 Br√∏ndby matches in the second half of the 2002‚Äì03 season, and helped the club win the 2003 Danish Cup. For the 2003‚Äì04 season, Br√∏ndby bought goalkeeper Karim Zaza who became their first choice, leaving Ankergren to spend the season as back-up keeper, playing only one match. At the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season, Zaza suffered an injury and Ankergren played the entire season as Br√∏ndby's starting goalkeeper, even after Zaza had recovered. Ankergren finished the season setting a league record 18 clean sheets in 32 matches, and helped Br√∏ndby win the Double of both the 2004‚Äì05 Superliga and 2005 Danish Cup titles. He started the 2005‚Äì06 season in the Br√∏ndby goal, but at the winter interval, Zaza was once again selected as first choice keeper. However, Zaza left the club in the summer of 2006 and Ankergren signed a new three-year contract. Br√∏ndby had a disappointing start to the 2006‚Äì07 season, sitting in seventh place at the winter break. However, Ankergren was called up to the Denmark national team by national manager Morten Olsen in October 2006, where he served as a back-up goalkeeper for Jesper Christiansen. When Br√∏ndby bought former Danish international goalkeeper Stephan Andersen, Ankergren announced his decision to leave the club. =Leeds United= In January 2007, he signed a loan with English club Leeds United. who were battling relegation in the Championship. He signed for the remainder of the 2006‚Äì07 Football League season, with an option for Leeds to buy him at a fixed transfer fee at the end of the season. Ankergren established himself as a firm favourite with the Leeds fans and displaced Neil Sullivan, Tony Warner and Graham Stack, putting in a number of matchwinning saves and performances. His popularity was further increased during the 1‚Äì0 victory over Luton Town when he made his second save from a penalty kick since joining Leeds. An injury temporarily forced him out of the team with another Leeds loanee goalkeeper Graham Stack taking his place, although Ankergen reclaimed his place in the team once he regained match fitness. He soon made it publicly known that he wanted to continue his stay at Leeds past his loan spell, and Leeds' manager Dennis Wise stated he wanted to keep Ankergen at the club. He transferred to Leeds for an undisclosed fee from Br√∏ndby, signing a three-year contract on 6 August 2007. Ankergen was Leeds' first choice goalkeeper in the 2007‚Äì08 season. On 8 October 2007, he was named League One Player of the Month for September due to his great goalkeeping displays. In the first 18 matches of the season, he kept 10 clean sheets and retained the number one jersey for a further 23 matches. He played in Leeds' first match at the new Wembley Stadium, the 1‚Äì0 2008 League One play-off Final defeat to Doncaster Rovers. He pulled off a string of impressive one-handed saves to keep his team in the match. He took part in Leeds' pre-season tour of Ireland for the 2008‚Äì09 season but was rested on occasions to give understudies David Lucas and Alan Martin first team goalkeeping experience. He started the first four matches of the full season but failed to keep a clean sheet as his team conceded six goals. He was dropped for the League Cup tie against Crystal Palace in favour of Lucas, which Leeds went on to win 4‚Äì0, and missed out in the subsequent 2‚Äì2 draw with Bristol Rovers. He was also dropped for the 5‚Äì2 win over Crewe Alexandra again in favour of Lucas, but returned to being first choice keeper under new manager Simon Grayson. At the start of the 2009/10 season, Ankergren was Leeds' number two goalkeeper behind Shane Higgs. Ankergren made his first appearance of the season coming on as a substitute for Higgs who suffered an injury during the match against Milton Keynes Dons, opening the door for Ankergren to start a few matches after Higgs was ruled out with a thigh injury. Leeds signed goalkeeper Frank Fielding as backup to Ankergren whilst Higgs was injured. Ankergen made his first start of the season against Carlisle United. He started a second successive match with Higgs still out and he kept a clean sheet in the match against Charlton Athletic. He continued to deputise for the injured Higgs and played 11 matches in all competitions with six clean sheets. New loan signing David Martin came into the team for the Football League Trophy match against Accrington Stanley with Ankergren dropping to the bench, but he returned to the starting line-up against Southampton and kept another clean sheet. With Higgs' injury more serious than originally thought, Ankergren has been given an extended run of matches. On 3 January 2010 Ankergen made several important saves for Leeds in their 1‚Äì0 FA Cup victory against Premier League champions Manchester United at Old Trafford, particularly from Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck shots. The following matches for Leeds saw a slump in form with Leeds drawing against Wycombe Wanderers and losing against Exeter City and Carlisle United. Ankergren had a fine match for Leeds in the FA Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur on 23 January 2010. Ankergen saved a first half penalty from Jermain Defoe, and also pulled off a string of fine saves as Leeds earned a replay with a 2‚Äì2 draw. On 3 February 2010 Ankergren put in an impressive performance after making several impressive saves against Tottenham in the FA Cup despite Leeds losing 3‚Äì1. Ankergren was involved in a penalty shoot-out for Leeds, but was unable to save a penalty for Leeds in the Football League Trophy Northern Area final second leg against Carlisle as Leeds were knocked out of the tournament after losing 6‚Äì5 in the shootout. After Leeds' number one goalkeeper Higgs returned from a long injury lay-off in a match against Norwich City, Ankergren dropped back to the substitutes bench. Leeds were promoted to the Championship after finishing in second place. It was announced on 14 May 2010 that Ankergren would not be offered a new deal at Leeds and that he was free to find a new club. Ankergren was replaced at Leeds by a fellow Dane Kasper Schmeichel who signed a deal two weeks after Ankergren was released. =Brighton & Hove Albion= Ankergren playing for Brighton & Hove Albion in 2015 On 6 August 2010, Ankergren signed for his former Leeds assistant manager Gus Poyet at Brighton. Ankergren made his Brighton debut the following day, in Brighton's opening match of the season 2‚Äì1 win over Swindon Town. He started well at Brighton, winning the League One Player of the Month for September 2010. He won the award again in March 2011, keeping five clean sheets in eight matches. On 12 April 2011, he helped Brighton gain promotion to the Championship after a 4‚Äì3 win over Dagenham & Redbridge. At the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, he retired from playing and became the assistant first team goalkeeping coach. International career While at K√∏ge, Ankergren played his first youth football for Denmark, making his debut for the under-17s in August 1995. He played three matches for the under-21s, but found himself the reserve of Rune Pedersen and eventually Stephan Andersen. While at Br√∏ndby, he served as sparring partner in various Danish national team training sessions around 2003. In October 2006, he received a call-up to the Denmark national team by manager Morten Olsen, as a replacement for injured Thomas S√∏rensen, but was an unused substitute in the match, and has not featured in a Danish squad since. In January 2006 and January 2007, he played unofficial international matches with the Denmark League XI national football team.

He was one of the musical Womack brothers, and had success both as a songwriter and recording artist, notably with his wife Linda as Womack & Womack. In later years he took the name Zekkariyas. Career Cecil Womack was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He and his brothers Bobby (1944‚Äì2014), Harry (1945‚Äì1974), Friendly and Curtis, were a gospel group appearing on the gospel circuit in the mid 50s where they were seen by Sam Cooke of the Soul Stirrers who signed them for his SAR records. As Cooke's prot√©g√©s they changed their name to the Valentinos and in 1961 began to sing and record for secular audiences. The Valentinos had hit records with \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" and \\"It's All Over Now\\", the latter being covered by the Rolling Stones. Cooke's death at a L.A. motel in December 1964, had dramatic consequences for the Womack Brothers as SAR folded and Bobby Womack, who was now married to Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara, left the group for a solo career. The Valentinos briefly disbanded before regrouping as a quartet in 1966, signing with Chess Records where they recorded the Northern Soul hit, \\"Sweeter than the Day Before\\", written by Cecil Womack and singer Mary Wells. Womack and Wells married in 1966 and formed the music publishing firm, Well-Wom, to market their jointly written songs. However, the group got dropped from Chess in 1968 after only two singles and Cecil Womack decided to leave the Valentinos. The remaining trio of Harry, Curtis and Friendly Jr. signed with Jubilee Records where they recorded the Cecil-composed \\"Two Lovers History\\" and \\"Tired Of Being Nobody\\" before being dropped in 1970 As the 1960s progressed Cecil Womack secured a role away from performing as a songwriter and producer. As husband of Mary Wells he was well placed to provide several R & B chart successes for her including \\"The Doctor\\", \\"Dig The Way I Feel\\" and \\"Never Give A Man The World\\" on which he backed his wife on vocals, all released on Jubilee Records.Joel Whitburn, Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles, 1942-2004, Billboard Chart Data, (2004) Womack's later songwriting credits include \\"Love TKO\\" a major hit for Teddy Pendergrass, \\"I Just Want To Satisfy You\\" for the O'Jays, \\"Love Symphony\\" for Patti LaBelle, \\"Your Song\\" for Four Tops and \\"New Day\\" for George Benson. Womack & Womack In 1983, Cecil and his wife Linda, who is Sam Cooke's daughter, began performing and recording together as Womack & Womack, and released a successful album, Love Wars on Elektra Records. The title track from the album was a no.14 hit in the UK, and the song \\"Baby I'm Scared Of You\\" was a hit on the Billboard R&B; chart in the US. In 1988, their single \\"Teardrops\\", taken from their fourth album Conscience, became a major international hit reportedly selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. It reached no.3 in the UK, and no.1 in the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. After traveling to Nigeria, they discovered ancestral ties to the Zekkariyas tribe, and Cecil adopted the name Zekkariyas. In 1993 they released their final album with a major label, Transformation To The House Of Zekkariyas. They continued to write for other artists, including Ruby Turner and Randy Crawford, Covers of Cecil Womack songs Mary Wells recorded the Valentinos \\"Two Lovers' History\\" in 1968. The Womack & Womack song \\"Love Wars\\" was covered by The Beautiful South for the 1990 compilation Rub√°iy√°t. Eric Clapton, Elton John, K.D. Lang and The Sugababes are amongst the artists who recorded \\"Lead Me On\\". His best-known song \\"Love T.K.O.\\" has been recorded by many artists, including Boz Scaggs, Teddy Pendergrass, Bette Midler and Michael McDonald. \\"Teardrops\\" has been covered by Lulu and by Joss Stone. Personal life In 1966, Womack married Motown singer Mary Wells at the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in Cleveland. Prior to that Womack fathered a son, Mustafa Womack in November of the same year. They had three children. Womack and Wells separated after he discovered she was having an affair with his brother Curtis Womack. They divorced in 1977. Cecil later married Linda Cooke, the daughter of Sam Cooke. This created an interesting family tree because Cecil's brother Bobby Womack had married Sam Cooke's widow Barbara Campbell in 1965. Cecil and Linda had seven children together, and had homes in Africa and Thailand. After 1994, Womack was known professionally and personally by the name Zekkariyas. Death Zekkariyas spent his final years traveling the world with his wife and children, using his time to explore his African heritage, spirituality, and knowledge of the continent as well as making music. He died of unknown causes in Johannesburg, South Africa, on January 25, 2013, at age 65.

He is best known for his songs about the American South, including \\"A Minstrel's Return from the War\\", \\"The Soldier's Farewell\\", \\"The Stonewall Quickstep\\", and \\"Somebody's Darling\\". His output during the American Civil War earned him the epithets \\"Bard of the Stars and Bars\\"Silber 57. and \\"Bard of the Confederacy\\".Abel 63. Over his career, Hewitt wrote over 300 songs, a number of cantatas and operettas, and one oratorio, as well as plays, poems, and articles for magazines and newspapers. He also worked as a theatre manager, magazine and newspaper editor, concert performer, and music teacher at seminaries for women. Early life and career Hewitt was born in New York City, into a musical family. His father, James Hewitt, was an influential music publisher, composer, and musician; his sister, Sophia Hewitt Ostinelli, would eventually become a renowned pianist. His brother, James Lang Hewitt, eventually took over his father's publishing operations; James was married to the poet, Mary E. Hewitt. His niece was soprano Eliza Biscaccianti. Nevertheless, Hewitt's father tried to steer his son away from the music business, apprenticing him in a number of other fields. In 1818, Hewitt entered West Point. His grades were bad overall, but the school provided his first formal musical training. By 1822, Hewitt did not have the grades to graduate, and his military career ended when he challenged a school officer to a duel. Hewitt in the South Hewitt moved to Augusta, Georgia, in 1823 to join his father's theatrical troupe. Their theatre burned down soon after his arrival, but Hewitt decided to stay in Augusta and open a music store where he could give private lessons for flute and piano. He became enamored of the South and its genteel traditions, and he enjoyed the attention paid to him by the wealthy parents of his pupils. However, Hewitt grew disillusioned as he realized that his dinner invitations came because his hosts wanted live music, not his company. Still, Hewitt took a permanent teaching position at the Baptist Female Academy in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1824, tutoring on the side. When a rival intimated that Hewitt was in fact a mulatto, Hewitt's private students quit him. He eventually had John C. Calhoun write a letter attesting to the allegation's falsity. Bard of the Confederacy In 1825, Hewitt wrote \\"The Minstrel's Return from the War\\" and published it through his brother in Boston. The song eventually became a success internationally, making him the first American-born composer whose fame reached both sides of the Atlantic. He married Estelle Mangin in 1827. In 1833 Hewitt was editor of the Baltimore Saturday Visiter. Not until 1840 would Hewitt pursue writing as a profession. That year he moved to Washington, D.C., to start and edit a newspaper. Over the next few years, he moved again and again, eventually ending up in Hampton, Virginia. There he took a position at the Chesapeake Female College and remained for nine years. His wife died during this tenure. By the start of the American Civil War, Hewitt had moved to Richmond, Virginia. He attempted to join the Confederate States Army, giving his background at West Point for credentials. He was already 60 years old, however, and the army would only offer him a drillmaster position. Hewitt turned it down. Instead, he took a job in November 1861 as the manager of the Richmond Theatre. During his stint there, he staged many of his own works, but in less than two years, the theatre owners grew tired of his authoritarian management practices. Hewitt was replaced by R. D'Orsey Ogden. He moved back to Augusta, where he joined Alfred Waldron to write pieces for the theatre and for the Queen Sisters, including the ballad operas King Linkum the First and The Vivandiere. He also began tutoring in private again, and he married an 18-year-old pupil named Mary Smith in 1863. With her he would father four more children, for a total of 11. In 1863 and 1864, Hewitt traveled with the Queen Sisters as a songwriter. They popularized his song \\"All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight\\", which became such a hit that his publisher went through five printings of the sheet music. His poetry, music, and drama grew increasingly pro-Southern and pro-Confederate. He published through John Schreiner beginning in 1864, but sent pieces secretly to the Blackmars under the pen name \\"Eugene Raymond\\". His Jephtha in 1846 may have been the first oratorio written by an American.Lawrence 396. Hewitt's output earned him the epithets \\"Bard of the Stars and Bars\\" and \\"Father of the American Ballad\\". Hewitt eventually bought the Augusta-based Blackmar publishers, but the business failed after the war. Hewitt returned to Virginia to teach at the Wesleyan Female Institute in Staunton and at the Dunbar Female Institute in Winchester. He bounced back and forth between Maryland and Georgia for the next few years, eventually ending up in Baltimore. He remained there until his death on 7 October 1890. Notes References * Abel, E.

He started playing in the Maccabi Tel Aviv Youth League. His first game took place in 1988-89 in a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv FC and Hapoel Jerusalem. From 1988 to 1992 he played for Maccabi Tel Aviv's first team. In 1992, he transferred to Ironi Rishon LeZion and reached the final of the State Cup with this team in 1995-96. At the end of the 1996 season, Elimelech moved to Hapoel Tel Aviv. With Hapoel Tel Aviv, he won three National Cups in (1999, 2000, 2006), one Championship in (2000) and one Toto Cup in (2002). During these seasons, Elimelech was acknowledged for his impressive one-on-one goalkeeping abilities and his success in stopping penalty kicks (both the 1999 and 2000 cups were obtained after penalty-shoot-outs, in which Elimelech stopped several opponent shots). Hapoel also reached the quarter final of the UEFA Cup while Elimelech was in goal displaying impressive reflexes and shot stopping abilities. His most memorable performance during that season was in the 1-1 draw against Chelsea in London, a result which was enough for Hapoel to qualify to the next round, after winning the first match in Tel Aviv 2-0. In April 2007, Elimelech spoke out against the management at Hapoel Tel Aviv, where fans considered him a symbol of the club. In retaliation, Hapoel's management opted to suspend the keeper until the end of his contract. Elimelech was eventually released from his contract and he signed with Hapoel Kiryat Shmona. His first game for the Israel national football team was on 18 January 1999 in a friendly match between Israel and Estonia which Israel won 7-0.

Zhizn began its existence as a general purpose magazine in January 1897. For the first two years it was edited, at various times, by S. V. Voejkov, D. M. Ostafyev, M. V. Kalitin, and M. S. Ermolaev and was published three times a month. In early 1899, the magazine was taken over by the socialist journalist Vladimir Posse, who changed the magazine to a monthly in April 1899. Although at first Posse stood between Marxists and narodniks (populists), he converted Zhizn into a flagship Legal Marxist publication after the suppression of the Legal Marxists' magazine Nachalo in June 1899. The magazine's editorial policy was largely under the control of Peter Struve and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, two leaders of the Legal Marxists. Like Nachalo, Zhizn was supportive of Eduard Bernstein's revision of Marxism and its editors were on the verge of moving from Marxism to liberalism, but the magazine continued to publish articles by revolutionary Marxists like Vladimir Lenin. Maxim Gorky, a friend of Posse's, served as the editor of the magazine's literary section and Anton Chekhov's famous story \\"In the Ravine\\" in January 1900. Other writers like Vikenty Veresayev contributed to the magazine as well. At first the government assigned the notorious censor to Zhizn, who banned two thirds of the content, but then a new censor, Vorshev, was assigned, who took a hands off approach: :You know, Vladimir Aleksandrovich, I am an old man and I poorly understand the latest literary and political trends, and it's hard for me to decide under current conditions what to permit and what not to permit. I will sign everything that you put in front of me, but I ask you not to let me down and to exercise the greatest caution. The magazine was, in effect, self-censored for three or four months, but eventually the government reinstated Elagin and censorship problems returned. The government finally closed the magazine down in April 1901 when it found out about revolutionary socialists (supposedly Boris Savinkov, Gariushin and Tatarov) using the magazine's offices for their secret meetings. Later in 1901 Posse moved to Ireland and then to London and began looking for a way to resume publication of the magazine, this time free of censorship. Although Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams (then Ariadna Borman)'s mission to Gorky, who was living in exile in Yalta at the time, in November 1901 proved unsuccessful, Posse eventually formed the \\"Zhizn Social-Democratic Group\\" with V. D. Velichkina and Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich, who provided financial and distribution support. The group published another 5 issues of Zhizn in London between April and August 1902. The last issue, \\"September‚ÄìDecember 1902\\", was published in Geneva in December 1902. This foreign-published version of Zhizn was increasingly opposed to the more radical version of Marxism espoused by Georgy Plekhanov, Lenin and other supporters of the rival social democratic newspapers Iskra and Zarya. Twelve issues of a companion magazine, Listki Zhizni (Life Leaflets) were published by Posse (as \\"F. Rosin\\") in London between May 15, 1902 (Gregorian calendar) and December 12, 1902 as a \\"non- factional Social-Democratic organ\\". Several volumes in an irregular \\"Zhizn Library\\" series were also published in 1902. The \\"Zhizn Social-Democratic Group\\" ceased to exist and publication stopped when Bonch-Bruevich had a falling out with Posse and left the group, joining Iskra and taking his distribution network with him. Bonch-Bruevich also transferred 19 manuscripts from Zhizn's portfolio to Iskra against the wishes of the \\"Zhizn Social- Democratic Group\\", which caused a controversy in early 1903. As a Modern Newspaper 2001- In 1991, the Zhizn publishing house was formed which began establishing regional newspapers in Russia. By 2001, the number had grown to 30, and all titles were merged into a new national newspaper, Zhizn. By 2005, Zhizn was the third most read national newspaper in Russia with a circulation of 2.1m. Presently, the Zhizn is regarded as a tabloid and a typical \\"yellow press\\". The newspaper is often providing gossip, scandals and questionable facts. Notes * See Maxim Gorky.

His sketchbook, discovered by his descendants in 1996, has provided contemporary images of events connected to the Eureka Stockade, that were important for the authentication of the original Eureka Flag. Charles Doudiet was born in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1844, at the age of twelve, Doudiet migrated from Switzerland to Canada East. His father, Reverend Jacques-Frederic Doudiet, worked with the French Canadian Missionary Society, a job that required much travelling, which Jacques-Frederic Doudiet documented in a series of sketchbooks. When 20-year-old Charles Doudiet left his home in Belle Riviere near Montreal, he carried a sketchbook like his father, to document his travels. By riverboat, train, then the clipper Magnolia, Doudiet travelled to Melbourne, attracted by the Victorian Gold Rush. On the diggings at Ballarat, Doudiet continued to document events, including the burning of Bentley's Pub on 17 October 1854. Bakery Hill on December 1, 1854: Swearing Allegiance to the \\"Southern Cross\\" by Charles Doudiet. Swearing Allegiance to the \\"Southern Cross\\" is an important historical work because it documents the meeting on Bakery Hill on 1 December 1854. Prior to the discovery of the sketchbook, there was no certain proof that the flag held by the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery was the original flag, as there were several different southern cross flag designs used on the gold fields at that time. Eureka Slaughter shows the troops lined up attacking the stockade on 3 December 1854. Accompanying the sketch is a descriptive passage with the footnote: \\"Joyce, Penny and Fletcher along with myself carried Ross to the Star where he died in great pain at about 2am on the 5th\\". This refers to fellow Canadian Captain Henry Ross, whom many believe to be the Eureka Flag's designer, who was carried to the Star Hotel after he was mortally wounded in the battle at dawn on 3 December 1854. Doudiet's Melbourne sketchbook ends in 1855, and soon after, Doudiet returned to Canada and married in March 1857. After several years, he studied theology at Queen's College, Kingston, Ontario, and was ordained as a minister in Montreal in 1869. He served several congregations before dying in Hallowell, Maine, on June 13, 1913. After descendants found Doudiet's sketchbook in an attic in 1996, it was put up for sale by auction at Christie's. Money was raised by the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery who purchased the sketchbook to add to the historical collection connected to Ballarat and the Eureka Stockade. In January 2012 an article in The Age newspaper discusses a theory that the work Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross is a forgery, although the writer concluded I don't for a minute believe that Doudiet's watercolours are fake....

The first Polish print was in the collection of the same name, ' (1993). :Although the narration is from the first person, it is commonly recognized that the narrator is Ijon Tichy. The story is about the travel of Tichy to the planet Abrazia (Polish: Abrazja), where, as Tichy had heard, the economy of the local civilization was based on the single huge dragon. The dragon is an allegory of the Soviet Union and its relations to its satellite states (\\"Soviet Empire\\"). Later a postscript was added to the story: \\"P.S. They say the dragon broke up into mall ones, but their appetite did not decrease.\\" Krzysztof Grudnik, \\"Po≈ºytek z trzech g≈Ç√≥w. O smoku Stanis≈Çawa Lema.\\", Guliwer. Kwartalnik o ksiƒÖ≈ºce dla dziecka, issue 1, 2010.  (Russian and Polish quotations) * \\"Ijon Tichy's Last Voyage\\" (not to be confused with \\"The Twenty-sixth and Last Voyage\\"); only published in the German (October 1996) and Polish (May 1999) editions of Playboy. * The 1961 short story Formula Lymphatera Lymphater's Formula was first published in the collection Ksiƒôga robot√≥w (Book of Robots) with the pre-annotation \\"from the memoirs of Ijon Tichy\\". The story was never republished with this pre- annotation, and nothing in the novel gives any indication at Ijon Tichy. Piotr Krywak tried to figure out possible explanations for this, apart from a typographical error. Piotr Krywak, ‚ÄûFormu≈Ça Lymphatera‚Äù Stanis≈Çawa Lema ‚Äì zapomniana opowie≈õƒá o Ijonie Tichym?, Annales Universitatis Paedagogicae Cracoviensis  Studia ad Bibliothecarum Scientiam Pertinentia, vol. 4, 2006 =Never translated in English= * \\"\\", a pro-Communist satire on Cold War. In this story, after a confused landing, Ijon finds himself amid an antagonism between two superpowers \\"Merka\\" and \\"Rasha\\", and recognizes his confusion only standing in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. The story was never republished after 1957. In the 1971 edition of Dzienniki gwiazdowe, the (fictional) introduction written by professor Tarantoga explains that, according to the Institute of Tychology, the 26th voyage does not belong to the pen of Ijon Tichy, i.e., it was an apocryphal tale. * \\"Formu≈Ça Lymphatera\\" (1961)  Adaptations  German-language adaptations of several voyages taken by Ijon Tichy exist. In 2001 and 2002, two independent short films were made, running about 15 minutes each, directed by Dennis Jacobsen, Randa Chahoud, and Oliver Jahn (Jahn also played the main character Ijon Tichy), with Nora Tschirner starring as the female hologram. Both short films are available as legal downloads from the official site of production company Bildwerke Berlin. In 2006, the same team produced a miniseries called Ijon Tichy: Raumpilot for German TV, with 6 episodes of 15 minutes each again, which premiered March 2007 on ZDF. A second series of 8 episodes followed in 2011. Theater in Quarantine and Sinking Ship Productions adapted \\"The Seventh Voyage\\", in which Tichy gets stuck in a time loop, into a work of streaming theater during the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece was created by director Jonathan Levin, playwright Josh Luxenberg, and performer Joshua William Gelb. The adaption, titled The 7th Voyage of Egon TichyThe 7th Voyage of Egon Tichy , was live- streamed twice on July 30, 2020 and posted on YouTube. It made use of Gelb's closet to represent Tichy's spaceship, and Gelb performed live with pre- recorded images of himself. \\"The Eleventh Voyage\\" was a base of the 1999 Futurama episode 0105 \\"Fear of a Bot Planet\\". \\"13 Things Lem Predicted About The Future We Live In\\" (retrieved April 14, 2020) In Lem's story Ijon Tichy crash-lands on a planet populated with human-hating robots, so he disguises himself as a robot. Eventually he finds out that all robots are in fact disguised humans. The story in Futurama loosely uses the plot trick of the planet of human-hating robots. \\"The Fourteenth Voyage\\" was rendered as an animation film in the Soviet Union in 1985.

He graduated from the School of Public and International Affairs (now the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs) in 1947, and two years later, in 1949, he graduated from Columbia Law School. As part of his undergraduate degree, Ryan completed a senior thesis titled \\"New York State Labor Legislation and Alfred E. Smith.\\" That same year, 1949, he was admitted to the bar and began his practice. Professional and legislative career Ryan served as assistant district attorney in New York County from 1950 until 1957 and then again from 1957 until 1961. In 1961, he was elected to Congress as a Democrat, representing Manhattan's Upper West Side, and was elected five more times. Ryan was an early opponent of American involvement in the Vietnam War, being the first member of the U.S. House to speak out against the war, and was active in supporting civil rights. At the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he was chosen as a delegate from New York. In 1965 Congressman Ryan was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City. With prominent support in the reform Democratic movement, he polled over 113,000 votes and finished third behind Abraham Beame and Paul Screvane. While he endorsed the Democratic ticket subsequent to his primary defeat, Republican- Liberal candidate John Lindsay was elected Mayor. Congressman Ryan championed the creation of a unit of the National Park Service from historic properties and significant natural resources in the hands of the federal government around the New York City metropolitan area, with the intention of providing millions of local residents and visitors the opportunity to visit a unit of the National Park System who might never have the opportunity otherwise. The enabling legislation to create the result, Gateway National Recreation Area, was signed shortly after his death. Death Redistricting following the 1970 census had put freshman representative Bella Abzug of the neighboring 19th district in the same district as Ryan. Abzug challenged the then ailing Ryan in the Democratic primary. Ryan prevailed by a considerable margin, but died two months later of throat cancer in New York City on September 17, 1972. His widow, Priscilla Ryan, ran to succeed her late husband, but was defeated in the special party convention to decide Ryan's replacement on the Democratic ballot, by Abzug. She also lost the general election to Abzug, running on the Liberal Party line. His brother, Hewitt Fitts Ryan, ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1986 and 1990 in California's 45th congressional district. Ryan was buried in St. Thomas Church Cemetery in Croom, Maryland.

It was created by G.F. Newman and stars Martin Shaw as Mr Justice Deed, a High Court judge who tries to seek real justice in the cases before him. It also stars Jenny Seagrove as the barrister Jo Mills QC, frequently the object of Deed's desire. A pilot episode was broadcast on 9 January 2001, followed by the first full series on 26 November 2001. The sixth and last series concluded on 18 January 2007. The programme then went on an indefinite break after Shaw became involved in another television programme (Inspector George Gently), and he and Seagrove expressed a wish for the format of the series to change before they filmed new episodes. By 2009, the series had officially been cancelled. The factual accuracy of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury not to let the series influence their view of trials‚Äîreferring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.  Premise  Sir John Deed (played by Martin Shaw) is a recently appointed High Court judge who actively seeks justice in the cases before him, while at the same time trying to rekindle an old romance with former pupil Jo Mills QC (played by Jenny Seagrove), who regularly appears in his court. Deed is described by creator and writer G.F. Newman as a character who \\"speaks out against all the petty rules and bureaucracy that frustrates us all but that most of us don't speak out against\\". Because of Deed's unorthodox actions, he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional-minded characters, including his ex-wife, barrister Georgina \\"George\\" Channing QC (played by Caroline Langrishe); her father Appeals Court Judge, Lord Justice (Sir Joseph) Channing (played by Sir Donald Sinden), fellow High Court Judges Mr Justice (Sir Monty) Everard (played by Simon Ward) and Mr Justice (Sir Michael) Niven (played by Trevor Bowen), the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department (LCD, later Department of Constitutional Affairs) Sir Ian Rochester (played by Simon Chandler); and later the Home Secretary Neil Haughton MP (played by Nick Reding and later Aneirin Hughes). Other recurring characters include Deed's rebellious, animal rights activist daughter Charlie (played by Louisa Clein), who is initially a law student but later progresses to the courts; Deed's police friend, deputy assistant commissioner Row Colemore (played by Christopher Cazenove); and his clerk, Rita \\"Coop\\" Cooper (played by Barbara Thorn), who is often on hand to temper some of his more radical ideas. Rita \\"Coop\\" was involved in many scenes of the show and was shown frequently in Judge John Deed advertisements. The first three series of the programme have a self-contained structure, with a trial reaching its conclusion by the end of an episode. In later years, the series added a serialised format, with stories running over a number of episodes and a greater focus on the personal lives of characters other than Deed, with the main case concluding in each episode.  Production  Newman devised his new series to highlight what he believed to be an out-of-touch judiciary and show \\"solutions\\" (a style that is different from, yet paradoxically similar to his previous work, such as his 1970s series Law and Order, which was heavily critical of the police, with Judge John Deed being heavily critical of the corrupt Establishment). Newman wrote the series intending to give the audience an exploration of the law without patronising them or getting caught up in an explanation of legal proceedings. A full series was commissioned before the pilot was broadcast. The series has been credited with renewing the \\"cop genre\\" by moving the story from a \\"maverick detective\\" to a high court judge, though as a comparison to Newman's previous work, a Guardian writer called it \\"rather soft\\" and doubted, from seeing the pilot, whether it would provoke questions in the House of Commons like Law and Order did, while the show went on to provoke much hostility from many groups which it portrayed as corrupt or negligent. Sets were constructed on the soundstages at Bushey, Hertfordshire for the courtroom, Deed's chambers and the main characters' houses. Exterior court scenes were filmed at the Crown Court in Aylesbury. Location filming was also done at West Herts College for scenes in \\"My Daughter, Right or Wrong\\" (2006) and at various locations, including The Hague City Hall, (as film location for the International Criminal Court building in The Hague) for \\"War Crimes\\" (2007). The robes worn by Deed in the sixth series were authentic ones from Stanley Ley, a specialist legal outfitters, and cost ¬£7,600. Theme music was composed for the series by Debbie Wiseman. The music, entitled \\"Judge John Deed\\", was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is described as a \\"stunning march-like theme that echoed throughout each of the programmes supplying pageantry to the Judge's sometimes-nefarious activities\\". It was released commercially on Wiseman's compilation album, Something Here, and as a single piece on online music retailers. From 2005 to 2007, television promotions for the series have been accompanied by the piano hook from \\"Sinnerman\\" by Nina Simone. 29 episodes were produced; the pilot, three series of four episodes, two series of six episodes and one series of two two-part serials. All episodes were written and produced, and occasionally directed, by Newman. At the time the sixth series concluded, the future of the series was in doubt; the BBC had announced an intention to use Martin Shaw in a range of new projects and it was apparent that the one-off adaption of Alan Hunter's Inspector Gently novels (starring Shaw as the eponymous inspector) would be commissioned for a full series. Jenny Seagrove clarified the situation, stating that the producers wanted to continue but she and Shaw were \\"taking a sabbatical\\" until the formula of the series was changed, implying that its future lay in the multi-part format introduced in series six. In April 2009, Shaw told BBC Breakfast that the series had been officially cancelled by the BBC because of financial cutbacks across the corporation. The six years the series was broadcast makes it the longest-running BBC legal drama.  Broadcast  Judge John Deed regularly formed the backbone of the BBC One winter schedule. The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8 p.m., with the second, third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings (8:30 p.m. for the first two and 8 p.m. for the latter, though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month). The fifth series moved to Friday nights, and the sixth was shown two nights a week, with the first part of the story on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday. This series was also the first to be simulcast on BBC HD. Occasionally, due to a clash with regional programming, it has aired at different times on BBC One Scotland; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half-hour earlier. Series five had a six-day delay. Ratings for the series peaked with its first episode at 9.1 million but it continued to regularly draw in around 6 million viewers for later episodes. The series has been shown internationally by, amongst others, Canvas (Belgium), BBC Canada and BBC Prime. In 2004, Variety reported an American remake was set to be produced for NBC; Michael Chernuchin was to produce the series, which would follow a federal court judge in Washington, D.C. who would preside over terrorism and civil rights cases. There have been no further developments since the announcement was made in 2004.  Reception  = Depiction of law = Judge John Deed presents a fictionalised version of the English legal system. The British Film Institute's Screenonline notes that \\"Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)\\", highlighting how unlikely it would be for a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Francesca Rochester, prevent him from being \\"a completely idealised heroic figure\\", and the fact that because all of his family and friends practise law, he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against. Deed has been accused of hypocrisy, particularly for using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in \\"Exacting Justice\\". There is a belief in some legal circles that, although Judge John Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment. Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group. The series' creative interpretation of the law has led to a misconception by the public of what real law is like (cf. CSI effect); in the second Damilola Taylor trial, the presiding judge warned the jury that if they copied Deed's actions in the then-recent episode \\"One Angry Man\\" (2006), in which Deed investigated a case and interviewed witnesses while sitting on a jury, they would \\"simply derail the whole process\\". = Critical reaction = The 2006 series caused controversy for the misguided information presented in \\"Silent Killer\\" (2006), which suggested a link between TETRA radio emissions and motor neurone disease. Statements were released by the TETRA Industry Group and the MND Association, the latter emphasising that while there is some evidence to suggest a link, it is not a single contributory factor. \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (2006) was criticised for portraying a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and the BBC received complaints on the matter. The Editorial Complaints Unit ruled that the episode had contravened the BBC's \\"obligation of due impartiality on matters of public controversy\\" and that the episode would not be repeated in its original form. The episode was cited in From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel, an internal BBC report on impartiality in its output that was published in June 2007, a section of which highlighted that the name of the Westwake character bore more than a passing resemblance to that of Dr Andrew Wakefield. Television pundits have criticised the writing of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts \\"often corny, even painfully so\\", using Monty Everard's line \\"You'll come to regret crossing swords with me, sir!\\" from \\"Health Hazard\\" (2003) as an example. Hanks also wrote about what he called \\"moral oversimplification\\" of the storylines; the same episode featured \\"a wealthy and self-important businessman‚Äîwho had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving‚Äîran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at‚Äîthe icing on this shabby cake‚ÄîDowning Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously\\". The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios. Andy Hamilton called the dialogue \\"the funniest on TV\\" and David Mitchell selected it as his \\"TV hell\\" in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Deed's \\"swashbuckling\\" persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers. Despite the criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships. The production style also rates highly; writing in The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot \\"glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work\\". Wry reference is made to Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed \\"is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC\\". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it \\"talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English\\". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; \\"Judge John Deed [‚Ä¶] is catnip to the ladies. These are chappishly called Georgie, Charlie, Jo and‚Äîwhen Rita defies abbreviation‚ÄîCoop\\". = Awards nominations = Stephen Roach received the Award of Merit at the 2005 Guild of Television Cameramen Awards for his work on the series. The series was nominated in the Diversity in Drama Production category at the 2006 Screen Nation Awards, though lost to an episode of Doctors.  Home release  The first series was released as a 3-disc set on 8 May 2006 and the second series as a 2-disc set on 12 February 2007.

It is the only Canadian art gallery exclusively dedicated to exhibiting and collecting contemporary Canadian ceramic, glass, enamel and stained glass works of art. It has approximately 20,000 annual visitors. The Canadian Guild of Potters ‚Äî which would later become known as Ceramists Canada ‚Äîwas formed in 1936. Concurrent with the founding of the guild came the first thought of establishing a national ceramics gallery. It wasn't until 45 years later that the idea gained traction. Construction of the gallery began in 1991 and the Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery opened in June 1993. The building was designed by Patkau Architects of Vancouver, who received a Medal of Excellence for the design under the Governor General's Awards for Architecture program in June 1997. The gallery has more than nine hundred items in the permanent collection and five exhibiting galleries. Building history = Construction = At a Ceramists Canada meeting in 1981 came a renewed call to find a permanent home for the country's finest ceramic pieces. This was prompted by a desire to honour the memory of recently dead Canadian potter Ruth Gowdy McKinley. The Glass Art Association of Canada and Artists in Stained Glass later became enthusiastic collaborators as the gallery concept evolved to also incorporate glass, stained glass, and enamel works. Calgary, Halifax, North York, Victoria, and Waterloo were investigated and evaluated as potential sites for the national gallery. During the Ceramists Canada 1982 Annual General Meeting, Waterloo emerged as the clear choice on the strength of its commitment to provide a prime uptown location. Over the next nine years, a core team of volunteers guided the planning and conducted the fundraising essential for a project of such magnitude. A 1984 feasibility study, funded by the federal and provincial governments, validated the need for a national gallery dedicated to the ceramic arts. In October 1986, a national architectural competition was held, inviting eight firms from across Canada for submissions. Vancouver architects John and Patricia Patkau finished first and subsequently transformed the property at the corner of Caroline and Erb Streets from an aged hockey arena into a cultural edifice. 1991 witnessed the start of construction and the Gallery officially opened its doors on June 19, 1993. Operations The Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery was incorporated as a not-for-profit public gallery in 1982 and is registered as a charitable organization. The Gallery's building in Uptown Waterloo is owned, managed, and maintained by the City of Waterloo. Under the terms of a 1994 lease agreement, the Gallery will remain the building's primary tenant for a 50-year term. = Funding = Currently The Clay & Glass receives annual and multi-year funding from the three levels of Canadian government ‚Äì‚Äì municipal, provincial and federal. This operating support is distributed by the Canada Council for the Arts, the Ontario Arts Council, Ontario Trillium Foundation, Museum Assistance Program and the City of Waterloo. The current operating budget is derived from three main revenue sources: government grants, community support and earned revenue. = Administrative = The Clay & Glass operates with an independent volunteer board of directors who provide oversight to the full-time Executive Director and staff. The Gallery is run by six departments, each headed by a full or part-time staff member. These departments include: Curatorial, Development, Marketing, Collections Management, Programming, and Gallery Shop. Exhibitions The gallery opened in 1993 with the purpose of exhibiting glass, ceramic, or enamel works. The Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery's exhibition mandate is to show contemporary work in these media. Since opening, The Clay & Glass has mounted over 178 exhibitions that have included works by artists from 25 countries. As such, the types of work exhibited have expanded greatly to include installation, video, performance, ephemeral, and environmental works. The gallery has 6088 square feet of exhibition space throughout five galleries: the Keith & Winifred Shantz Gallery, Donald & Pamela Bierstock Circular Gallery, The Mutual Group Tower Gallery, Dr. Douglas Wright Education Gallery, and the John A. Pollock Family Courtyard Gallery. Permanent collections One of the Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery's key objectives is the development, management and conservation of its Permanent Collection to the highest art museum standards for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future audiences. The collection mandate is to acquire ceramic, glass, enamel and stained glass. The primary permanent collection currently comprises over 900 works. In keeping with a mandate of being an institution whose focus is on contemporary practice, the Gallery's art collection features works of art from the mid-20th century to the present. The collection began with a donation of about 200 pieces. This gift provided the foundation and first major grouping around which the permanent collection would be built. Indusmin, a mining company providing raw silica products, was a corporate supporter and collector of silica based artworks for many years. Eventually the company was bought out and merged with another company called Unimin Canada Ltd., who acquired the former's vast art collection. Unimin Canada Ltd. wished to support the emerging national gallery and donated the Indusmin collection to the Gallery in 1991. As the gallery developed and expanded, curatorial interest changed along with staff. The collecting policy gradually shifted to focusing on contemporary practice. One aspect of adding to the collection, which is taking precedence, is the acquisition of work that has been part of the Gallery's exhibitions. = Cultural Property = On June 30, 2008 the Gallery was granted Category 'A' status within the Cultural Properties Export and Import Act. The Minister of Canadian Heritage provides this designation to \\"institutions that have the capacity to ensure their long-term preservation and to make them accessible to the public through research, exhibitions, publications and websites.\\" In effect, the Government of Canada entrusts the Gallery to house and steward artworks deemed to be national treasures, on behalf of the people of Canada. The Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery is honoured to be an institutional custodian of works of cultural importance on behalf of Canadians everywhere. = Study Collection = The Gallery has an extensive education and scholarly Study Collection. This collection comprises primarily industrial or functional objects, including paperweights, bottles, technical objects, vessels, commercial pressed glass and ceramic moulds. These objects are available for academics, researchers and other artists to touch, feel and inspect. This collection is also the foundation upon which an extensive educational curriculum is based. The gallery uses these materials primarily as a \\"study collection\\". = Archives = The Ann Roberts Archival Centre holds an extensive and growing number of archives. Currently there are over 8 fonds from individual artists, galleries, companies, scholars and organizations. They consist of unique primary materials such as personal papers, notebooks, sketchbooks, scrapbooks, drawings, blueprints, ephemera, photographs, slides, and transparencies. The archival collections are available for use by researchers.  Library  The Sinclair Family Research Library of the Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery is Canada's foremost library on the art and history of glass and ceramics. The library has an extensive holding of Exhibition catalogues, both from the venue itself and outside, trade publications related to the fields of glass and ceramics, works on paper, slides of the collection and early gallery, as well as educational movies. The library is open to Academics, persons interested in the field, practising artists as well as the public by appointment. Public programming The educational offerings have evolved to include regular ongoing school and after-school programs, spring and summer art camps, teen- and family-focused sessions, youth public art projects, and adult workshops for both beginners and experienced artists. Most of the recreational educational offerings are intended to help individuals develop an arts vocabulary and gain enough knowledge to interpret and appreciate contemporary glass, ceramic, and enamel artworks. Over 4,000 children participate in curriculum-based school programs. General public programming includes the very successful Play with Clay program, and public lectures. The four completed Youth Public Art Projects gave local high school students the opportunity to collaborate on a permanent, large-scale artwork that deals with current art issues and that has a visible presence in their community.

It is an exhibit at The Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1935 and based upon Rand McNally political maps published the previous year, the Mapparium shows the political world as it was at that time, including such long-disused labels as Italian East Africa and Siam, as well as more recently defunct political entities such as the Soviet Union. In 1939, 1958, and 1966 the Church considered updating the map, but rejected it on the basis of cost and the special interest it holds as a historical artifact.Mary Baker Eddy Library, history of Mapparium\\"Mapparium anniversary celebrated\\", The Christian Science Monitor. September 28, 2005. Design and construction In the 1930s, during the construction of the Christian Science Publishing Society building, the architect Chester Lindsay Churchill was inspired to design a globe to represent the Christian Science Monitor's global awareness and global reach. Churchill was originally influenced by the famous spinning globe in the lobby of the New York Daily News building. The 608 stained glass panels were produced by the Rambusch Company of New York City and the Mapparium was opened to the public on June 1, 1935. The Mapparium was closed in 1998 for a four- year cleaning and renovation. It reopened in 2002 as an exhibit of The Mary Baker Eddy Library, and now features a light-and-sound-show that illustrates how the world has changed since 1935. Computer-controlled lighting by the Color Kinetics company provides effects and highlights regions as the narration discusses them. The stained glass restoration was performed by the Boston-area firm Serpentino Stained Glass. In 2004, the name Mapparium was registered as a U.S. trademark (#2861312) by the Board of Directors of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, for \\"Educational services, namely, providing an educational exhibition of the earth. First use: 19350531.

This is the only configuration that places the eye at the same distance from every point on the globe. Andrew Sinclair's comments show the success of this ideaThe Best Map In / Of the World, Andrewsinclair.org > The Mapparium is so large, and you can see so much of it at once (because > it's concave instead of convex), that you can really get an idea of relative > sizes and distances.

It forms a remarkable whispering gallery so that visitors standing at corresponding locations near opposite ends of the bridge can speak to each other and be heard as if they were standing next to each other. One visitor writes: > There are many whispering galleries around the world, such as in St Paul's > Cathedral in London, or the Echo Wall in Beijing's Temple of Heaven. > However, the Mapparium is different in that speaking in any direction, since > it is a full sphere, will result in the same effect.

Formerly located adjacent to the campuses of the University of Notre Dame, St. Mary's College, and Holy Cross College, in 2012, the school moved to a new location about a mile south of Notre Dame. It is located within the Diocese of Fort Wayne‚ÄìSouth Bend.  History  Saint Joseph's High School began classes on September 20, 1953, as the first consolidated, co-institutional Catholic high school in the South Bend area. The school was made up of students from Central Catholic High School, Saint Hedwig School, Saint Joseph's Academy, and South Bend Catholic High School. Contributions from South Bend and Mishawaka parishioners enabled building the school on of land donated to the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend by the Brothers of Holy Cross. From 1953 to 1968, Saint Joseph's High School had separate divisions for boys and girls. The faculty consisted primarily of Sisters of the Holy Cross and Brothers of Holy Cross. In 1968 the school became coeducational. In 2012, St. Joseph's constructed a new building on the site formerly occupied by Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center. Along with the new building, the official name of the school was changed from Saint Joseph's High School to Saint Joseph High School.

She was born during the \\"Scenes of Metz\\", in which the public was scandalised to learn of the adultery of her stepfather-to-be, Louis XV of France. Early life Her biological father was Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'√âtiolles, husband of the future marquise de Pompadour, who was not yet Louis XV's mistress at the birth of her daughter. She had an older brother, Charles Guillaume Louis (1741‚Äì42), who died in infancy. Alexandrine was nicknamed \\"Fanfan\\" by her family. She is remarked to have been very thin throughout her very short life, but healthy.Madame De Pompadour: Mistress of France, Google books :Madame De Pompadour Her mother became mistress of Louis XV in 1745. Louis arranged the legal separation of her parents and served as her unofficial stepfather for the rest of her life.Letters to Fan-fan, a play by Deborah Davis, recounts Madame de Pompadour's relationship with Louis XV from the point of view of his wife, Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, and suggests that the Queen encouraged the relationship in order to diminish the hold his advisors had on the King - leading to a friendship between the two women. Life at convent At the age of six, Fanfan was put in the convent of the Assumption in the rue Saint-Honor√© in Paris, a convent for girls of the nobility that served as her finishing school. She was betrothed at age eight to the Duke of Picquigny, son of the Duke of Chaulnes, with the agreement that she would marry Picquigny at the age of twelve. Fran√ßois Poisson, Madame de Pompadour's father, doted on his granddaughter, whom he loved dearly. Madame de Pompadour even wrote, \\"Why must grandpapas always spoil their grandchildren?\\", referring to Poisson's love for Fanfan. Death On 4 June 1754, Fanfan took ill at the convent of the Assumption. Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'√âtiolles rushed to her side, but Madame de Pompadour, who was at Versailles, could not come. Upon learning of her illness, Louis XV sent two of his own doctors to her side, but the child had already died of acute peritonitis when they arrived. Fanfan was a few months shy of turning ten years old.Algrant. p. 163. Her grandfather, Fran√ßois Poisson, died eleven days later, on 25 June 1754, devastated by his dear Fanfan's death. Her mother reportedly never recovered from the loss of her daughter and father within a few days.

Cricket career The South African team that toured England in 1894. Arthur Seccull is standing at the far right. An all-rounder, Seccull was a member of the first South African team to tour England in 1894. No Tests or first-class matches were played on the tour. He scored 355 runs with a top score of 63 against Glamorgan, when he made the highest score in the match, but took only four wickets on the tour. In South Africa in 1895-96 he played in the Third Test at Cape Town against the England side under Lord Hawke, scoring 6 and 17 not out and taking two wickets for 37 runs. Seccull's provincial cricket in South Africa was mainly for Transvaal, though he also appeared for Kimberley and Western Province. He played in consecutive Currie Cup-winning finals for different teams. In the first, in 1893-94, he took his best first-class bowling figures of 6 for 48 in the second innings to help Western Province to an innings victory in the final against Natal. A year later he made his highest first-class score of 64, the highest score in the match, to help Transvaal to victory over Western Province.

Historically in Cumberland, it is situated on the A595 road between Whitehaven and Barrow-in-Furness. It has a population of 1,230,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Copeland Retrieved 2 June 2010 increasing to 1,396 at the 2011 Census. Adjacent settlements include Whitehaven, Egremont, Ravenglass and Wasdale. It is close to Wastwater, the deepest lake in England, and just a 7-minute drive from Seascale village and beach. The Cumbrian Coast railway can be accessed at Seascale. Viking heritage Gosforth contains a unique collection of Norse artefacts in and around St. Mary's Church. This includes the Gosforth cross, which is the tallest and oldest Viking cross in England. Another high cross was cut down in 1789 to make a sundial base, though the \\"fishing stone\\" panel from this survives in the church. There are also two large \\"hogback\\" tombs in the church. Gosforth Hall Work began on Gosforth Hall, now a hotel and restaurant near St. Mary's Church, in 1658, by a local gentleman called Robert Copley. The date of completion is not clear, although the date on the coat of arms situated in the bar is 1673. Copley had previously refused to pay the royal herald for his own coat of arms and instead, made one up himself. In his history of The Gosforth District, Dr. C.A. Parker states that Robert Copley in 1658 built \\"a large handsome house with orchards and gardens suitable\\", and Parker states that henceforth the house was named Gosforth Hall. With the hall being within the precinct of the church, it was likely that evidence of earlier occupation might be discovered. In 2005, the present owners of Gosforth Hall commissioned a small archaeological excavation within the grounds. This turned up some interesting finds indicating previous occupation on the site. This preliminary work was to be followed up in 2007 with a further excavation. Events Gosforth is the base for two major athletic events each year, a ten-mile run and associated fun run in June, and a ten-kilometre race on the first Tuesday in September. There is a thriving art scene in the village, and the Gosforth and District Arts Society (GADAS) holds weekly meetings as well as a very popular art exhibition every year, over the August bank holiday in the village hall. On the morning of 2 June 2010, professional rugby league player and farmer Garry Purdham was shot dead at a farm in the Gosforth area. Within hours, police had identified the killer as 52-year-old local taxi driver Derrick Bird, who killed eleven other people in the Cumbria shootings, a rampage in the surrounding area, before taking his own life.
