Seeking to move beyond existing romantic nationalism, Lange sought to build a wider nationalist ideology on the German political right by marrying anti-Semitism to other economic and social issues. He would prove an influential figure for groups that followed. Early years After taking a doctorate in ancient philosophy at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1873, Lange taught at a preparatory school before taking up journalism in the 1880s.Roderick Stackelberg, \\"Lange, Friedrich (1852-1917)\\", in Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 410 He became editor of the conservative daily T√§gliche Rundschau in 1890 and then in 1895 the Deutsche Zeitung. He would also edit the Zeitschrift f√ºr die Reform der h√∂heren Schulen. An early disciple of Paul de Lagarde, Lange was part of the Burschenschaft movement and absorbed the strong strain of German nationalism rife within that tendency.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 220 In the 1890s Lange became convinced that the Jewish influence in schools was too strong and he played a leading role in organising a petition for school reform, aimed at increasing the teaching of German studies and minimising Jewish influence through the School Reform Association, which he led with Theodor Peters.James C. Albisetti, Secondary School Reform in Imperial Germany, Princeton University Press, 2014, pp. 147, 158, 166 He was also close to Carl Peters and the Society for German Colonization. Ideology Lange was strongly anti- Semitic in outlook, but was also highly critical of the anti-Semitic parties that had been formed in Germany, decrying them for their rabble-rousing, their attempts to build a mass movement and their lack of any coherent platform beyond crude Jew-baiting. Rejecting party politics, he felt the V√∂lkisch movement needed to influence the upper echelons of society in order to succeed, offering deeper ideas that would inevitably include anti-Semitism, but also place influence what he saw as the positivity of German identity, rather than just negative attacks on the Jews. His idea of \\"pure Germanism\\" would marry anti-Semitism to nationalism, glorification of war as an aim of state, territorial expansion, autarchy and the preservation of the traditional Mittelstand through economic reform.Shulamit Volkov, Germans, Jews, and Antisemites: Trials in Emancipation, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 115 As well as the Jews, whom he targeted through calls for boycotts of their businesses and laws against marriage to Christians, he was also strongly opposed to socialism and the Roman Catholic Church.Lora Wildenthal, German Women for Empire, 1884 1945, Duke University Press, 2011, p. 20 He was strongly critical of the rise of capitalism in Germany, with his 1893 play Der Nachtse exploring anti-capitalist themes and indeed he was known to use the term \\"national socialism\\" for his preferred economic vision. Lange was also critical of the ideas of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, describing their reactionary romantic nationalism as \\"self deceiving\\" and instead coming out in favour of scientific progress as part of his overall vision. Deutschbund To this end in 1894 he established the Deutschbund, a v√∂lkisch group with a small elite membership. With a clandestine structure made up of only well educated members of the upper middle classes, it had at its peak only 1,100 members but exercised wide influence due to the leading positions in society occupied by those who had joined. Heinrich Class, whose Pan-German League would go on to become the most important far right group in pre-1914 Germany, claimed that his entire V√∂lkisch outlook was shaped by his time in the Deutschbund. Lange shared much of the League's ideology, although he was never a formal member of the group. His ideas were also an important influence on the development of the Wandervogel movement. Unlike most other groups operating in this sphere the Deutschbund was not closed down in 1933 and continued limited operations in Nazi Germany.Stackelberg, op cit, p. 411 Later years In 1902 he established the Nationalen Reichswahlverband as an attempt to co-ordinate non-socialist political parties into a single group. This however proved fairly short-lived as it was absorbed by the wider Reichsverband gegen die Sozialdemokratie in 1905. He also gave his support to the German Eastern Marches Society, becoming a member of the group. He retired from political life in 1912 and died in 1917.

Moore soon became involved with local politics in West Palm Beach, beginning with serving as a member of the Greater West Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors in 1963. Two years later, he mounted a successful campaign for city commissioner, an office he would hold from 1965 to 1969. During his tenure, he was chosen by his fellow commissioners to be Mayor of West Palm Beach from 1967 to 1968, as the city operated under the Council‚Äìmanager form of government at the time. After leaving office as a city commissioner of West Palm Beach, Moore was elected to 79th district of the Florida House of Representatives in 1976 and served one term before losing re- election in 1978. However, he made another successful run for office in 1980, this time for the 81st district of the Florida House of Representatives. Early life and education Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Moore attended Baylor School as a boy, before going to Yale University, where he earned a B.A. in 1956. Continuing his education, he went to the University of Virginia School of Law and completed a LL.B. in 1959. That same year, he moved to Florida and soon practiced law with his father. Politicial career By 1963, Moore was involved with the local government of West Palm Beach, serving as a member of the Greater West Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. He sought political office for the first time in 1965, running for Group E of the West Palm Beach City Commission. He pledged cooperation with citizens and fellow commissioners, while emphasizing the need for improvements to downtown, the local tourism industry, and major roads. His campaign was successful and he led his nearest opponent‚Äîthree-time commissioner Sylvan B. Burdick‚Äîby a vote of 3,511 to 1,988. Moore was sworn into office as a city commissioner on March 31, 1965. During his tenure, the city commissioners unanimously selected Moore to serve as Mayor of West Palm Beach from 1967 to 1968, under the Council‚Äìmanager form of government. After four years on the city commission Moore declined to run for re-election for his seat and was succeeded by Francis H. Foster Jr. in March 1969. He served as a Republican in the Florida House of Representatives from 1976 to 1978, representing the 79th district. During his 1976 campaign for that office, Moore's slogan was \\"We need More in Tallahassee.\\" He described himself as a \\"moderate conservative\\" and ran on his record as city commissioner and Mayor of West Palm Beach, including establishing the Downtown Development Authority. After losing re-election to Eleanor Weinstock in 1978, he mounted another successful campaign for Florida House of Representatives in 1980 this time representing the 81st district from 1980 to 1982.

Standing, from left to right: Major James B. Abbott, Captain Joshua A. Pike, Jacob Senix, Joseph Gardner, Thomas Simmons, S.J. Willis, Charles Doy, Captain John E. Stuart [Stewart], Silas Soule, and George R. Hay. Seated in front: Dr. John Doy. The Immortal Ten were a group of militant abolitionists and Free-Staters in the Kansas Territory who, on July 23, 1859, freed Dr. John Doy from a Missouri jail, where he was being held for allegedly abducting slaves. Doy and his 19-year-old son Charles were fellow abolitionists who had been arrested by pro-slavery Missouri bounty hunters while trying to deliver slaves to freedom in the Nebraska Territory via the Underground Railroad. While his son was acquitted of the charges and released, John was sentenced to prison. The ten men who took it upon themselves to rescue Doy were led by Major James B. Abbott and included Doy‚Äôs son Charles, George R. Hay, Silas Soule, Capt. John E. Stewart, S.J. Willis, Thomas Simmons, Joseph Gardner, Jacob Senix, and Captain Joshua A. Pike. The episode occurred during a period of violent interstate ideological conflict preceding the American Civil War known as \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". Capture of John and Charles Doy On January 25, 1859, the Doys were passing through Lawrence, Kansas en route to the Nebraska Territory with thirteen slaves. John and Charles were just 12 miles outside of Lawrence when they were caught and surrounded by a group of armed pro-slavery \\"Border Ruffians\\" who had come from Missouri (a slave state) for the purpose of capturing escaped slaves and stopping activity on the Underground Railroad. When confronted, John was threatened to be killed on the spot. All that he asked was that they did not fire toward the carriage, since there were women and children inside. The option of fighting back was not in the Doys' favor as they were greatly outnumbered. Both John and Charles were arrested and thrown in jail temporarily until their trial on March 20, 1859, in St. Joseph, Missouri. Charles was eventually cleared of all charges, but the jury could not agree on a verdict for John and he was tried a second time. At the second trial, Dr. Doy was convicted of abducting slaves and sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Rescue Doy's account of his ordeal In the summer of 1859, while Dr. Doy was imprisoned in the St. Joseph jail, Major James B. Abbott put together a crew of ten men to rescue him. The plan was carried out on July 23. Two of the men pretended to be bounty hunters who had caught a horse thief (who was also part of the crew) and distracted the guards while the rest of the men overtook the prison and went after Doy. Doy was found very ill and unable to walk due to exhaustion and disease, so a couple of the men carried him out. A famous ambrotype photograph of the Immortal Ten was taken in Lawrence by photographer Amon Gilbert DaLee shortly after the rescue. It depicts the whole crew together while Doy is sitting in a chair in the front, unable to stand on his own. A bounty was put on Doy's head for $100 if caught outside Missouri and $50 if caught inside Missouri. Soon after his escape, Dr. Doy left Lawrence for Rochester, New York, where he published a book, The narrative of John Doy, of Lawrence, Kansas : \\"A plain, unvarnished tale\\" (1860), giving an account of his trial and conviction. His book spoke kindly of the witnesses and attorneys who prosecuted him, but bitterly of the officers and jury who convicted him. He died in New York a few years later. His son Charles was hanged in southern Kansas for horse theft in the fall of 1860. Later achievements of the Immortal Ten One member of the Immortal Ten was acknowledged for his brave act and was able to make his own place in history. Silas Soule was a well-known anti-slavery militant and a personal friend of John Brown and Walt Whitman. During the American Civil War, he joined a Colorado volunteer army fighting for the Union and was eventually promoted to the rank of captain. Soule was present at the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in 1864, where he ordered his unit not to participate in the slaughter. He also later testified against the units that did participate and was murdered as a result. Film Doy's rescue by the Immortal Ten is the subject of a 2017 book by author Gary Jenkins, The Immortal 10: A Story from the Kansas Underground Railroad. A documentary film based on the book, The Immortal 10 and the Rescue of Dr. John Doy, was also released. References Further reading *Doy, John.

Advaita Vedanta‚Äôs interpretation Shankara, in the context of the desire to know Brahman, does not equate Jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ or the desire to know, with inquiry, simply because the act of inquiry requires as its prior motivation the desire to know and which desire does not depend upon the desire to know how to perform rituals. It is his opinion that the uncaused pure desire to know must be accompanied by the motivation for the comparative study of the scriptures. In this context Radhakrishnan states:- : (quote) ‚Äì \\"Ascent to higher levels of living, losing oneself to find the higher self can be achieved through jijnasa or disinterested passion for knowledge. It lifts man out of his narrow limits and makes him forget his self in the contemplation of the universal principles of existence. Knowledge pursued for the sake of power or fame does not take us far. It must be sought for attaining the truth.\\" (end of quote) Shankara holds the view that it is logical for a man who has studied the Upanishads to undertake a deliberation on Brahman even without deliberation on the religious rites. According to him deliberations, on virtuous deeds and Brahman, differ as regards results and objects of inquiry because virtuous deeds are related to things yet to be accomplished whereas Brahman is a pre-existing entity. Swami Gambhirananda explains that the phrase - Brahma-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ, literally means - 'a wish to know Brahman'; and a wish invariably proceeds spontaneously from the knowledge that something is achievable by effort and that when achieved would lead to desirable results. In the sutra ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§•‡§æ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ, this phrase means - 'a deliberation on the nature of Brahman'. In his commentary on this sutra, Shankara has extended the intended knowledge of Brahman far beyond the limits of informative knowledge and has indicated direct realisation of identity as its goal. The word ‡§Ö‡§•‡§É means ‚Äì 'thereafter' or 'hereafter', and the end result of this inquiry is knowledge of Brahman. Significance Jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ as a philosophical investigation removes the obstacles to aproksha j√±ƒÅna which are ‚Äì a) 'ignorance of the subject' and b) 'doubts and misconceptions regarding the truth and the import of the scriptures'. The knowledge of Brahman has its culmination in anubhava ('direct experience/realisation'), and in the matter of Brhama-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ, ≈õruti alone is not the pramƒÅna ('instrument of knowledge'), both, ≈õruti and anubhava combined are the pramƒÅna. Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (Sloka VII.67) reminds us:- :‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§£ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¨‡•Å‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã ‡§Ø ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  :‡§Ö‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§Ç‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•å  : \\"Indra acquired indirect knowledge of Brahman by studying Its attributes; he then went to his teacher four times with a view to gaining direct knowledge of the self.\\" which statement emphasizes acquisition of indirect knowledge and the direct knowledge to realize that the individual self is the same as the universal self.  Dharma-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ In the matter of Dharma-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ the emphasis is on knowing or becoming familiar with the rituals thus converting that process into an act of inquiry. VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra makes a distinction between jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ as the instigating desire to know and mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ as the activity of inquiry equivalent to jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ as inquiry (vicƒÅra) commanding respect. Ramanuja upholds the view that jnana i.e. 'knowledge', should be action-oriented to produce results, mere knowledge provided by testimony does not result in liberation. He relies on Badarayana‚Äôs sutra III.iv.26 which reads as follows:‚Äì :‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§§‡•á‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡§§‡•ç : \\"On the strength of the Upanishadic sanction of sacrifices etc., all religious activities as well are necessary. This is the same as in the case of a horse in matters of its adequacy. \\" and approves selective use of religious rituals.

Lyons was the creative director and president for J.Crew from 2008 and 2010, respectively. In April 2017, her departure from J.Crew was announced after two years of declining sales. In 2013, Lyons had been referred to as the \\"Woman Who Dresses America\\". In 2017, The New York Times commented that \\"the face of the brand became the symbol of its fall.\\" Early life and education Lyons was born Judith Lyons in Boston, Massachusetts, but moved to Palos Verdes, California when she was four. Here, she grew up being subjected to heavy bullying, due to her gawkiness and health issues. She suffered from incontinentia pigmenti, a genetic disorder which scarred her skin, caused her hair to fall out in patches, and caused her teeth to be malformed, which is the reason she still wears dentures to this day. Much of Lyons' outlooks and interests stem from her childhood experiences. About her childhood, she states that her genetic condition \\"made me introverted, but it was also the reason I loved fashion, because it can change who you are and how you feel, and that can be magical.\\" Her mother was a piano teacher who encouraged her to get involved creatively, leading to her interest in fashion. She loved to rebel against her school uniform, and she learned to sew in seventh grade, which granted her more confidence. One of her personal motivations for success stems from witnessing her parents' divorce and having to never rely on a man to get by. Due to her interest and talent for fashion, Lyons attended Parsons and graduated in 1990. Career Fresh out of Parsons, Lyons landed her first job at J.Crew when she was 21. She began as an assistant designer in men's wear, and her first assignment was redesigning men's rugby shirts for the company. She began to work her way up, and by 2003 she was J.Crew's Vice President of Women's Design. When current CEO and chairman Millard Drexler was hired in 2003, he and Lyons began to form a close relationship. The two were key players in helping J.Crew triple its revenue from just short of $690 million in 2003 to just shy of $2 billion in 2011. In 2008, Drexler appointed Lyons the executive creative director, and in 2010 he appointed her president as well. Lyons has said her holding both of these roles, \\"no financial decision weighs heavier than a creative decision. They are equal.\\" In this role, Lyons oversaw the over one hundred designers of J.Crew and directed the layouts, designs, and looks for the J.Crew catalog, or as the company calls it, its Style Guide. Lyons crafted the brand and style of J.Crew around her trademark style. She made J.Crew a tastemaker in the industry, though Lyons herself does not like to refer to herself as a tastemaker. Part of this shift in branding was in their Style Guide. Lyons wanted it to have the feel of a fashion magazine, and the amount of editorial content increased drastically. This included a section entitled \\"Jenna's Picks\\" that looked at her opinions and revealed more about her everyday life. It also highlighted Lyons' personal clothing style, described by The New York Times as \\"geek-chic quirkiness, which mixed camouflage and sequins for day, and denim and taffeta for evening, all of it layered with big costume jewelry\\". While this contributed to her fame, it also led to controversy when she was featured painting her then 3-year-old son's toenails hot pink. Though Beckett requested it to be done, some called this act \\"an attack on masculinity.\\" Others, however, viewed it as a breaking from gender norms. Despite it gaining national attention, such as being featured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart where it was labeled \\"Toemaggedon\\", both Lyons and J.Crew declined to comment. Lyons' departure from J.Crew in 2017 was connected to declining sales and financial problems at the company. Her overarching role overseeing all aesthetic aspects of the brand (including store design and marketing) was not maintained, with the new chief design officer, Somsack Sikhounmuong, focusing more narrowly on women's, men's and children's clothing. Personal life Lyons was married to artist Vincent Mazeau for nine years, with whom she had a son, Beckett. In 2011, however, the couple divorced and sold their Brooklyn townhome. In 2012, she publicly acknowledged her relationship with Courtney Crangi, and as of 2013 she was living in Tribeca with her son, Beckett. Lyons and Crangi split up in December 2017. Awards and accolades Lyons won Glamour's 2012 Women of the Year award. She holds a position on the Council of Fashion Designers of America Board of Directors.

The scenic road, which was never completed, features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse riding trails in the area. Route description Lakeview Drive East entrance sign Lakeview Drive West is the shorter road segment; located at Fontana Dam, the road hugs the north-western shore of Little Tennessee River section of Fontana Lake before ending at a parking area. Both, the Appalachian Trail and Benton MacKaye Trail, overlap this road segment. Lakeview Drive East, located near Bryson City, is a road from Fontana Road (SR 1364) to a parking area, located less than a from the road tunnel. The road, over above the Tuckasegee River section of Fontana Lake, curves along Mine Mountain and Buzzardroost Mountain before crossing over Noland Creek and then ending at the edge of Tunnel Ridge. Stone facades on bridges and wooden rails along it shoulders appears similar to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The speed limit along the road is . Lakeshore Trail connects both segments of Lakeview Drive by following the proposed routing of the road. The trail includes the half- mile portion of road and tunnel that was never opened for vehicles. The Lakeshore Trail connects with other trails that cross-cross the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and has several campsites. Some portions of the trail follow old NC 288, where hikers may see abandoned automobiles from 1920's-1930's and a bridge at Lands Creek during the winter months, when lake levels are low. History Bridge over Noland Creek The poles signify the road end The Lakeview Drive road tunnel The story of Lakeview Drive begins on July 30, 1943, when the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the state of North Carolina, Swain County and the Department of the Interior (DOI) entered into an agreement that called for: # TVA to pay $400,000 to the county as compensation for the flooding of North Carolina Highway 288. # TVA to buy the , displacing the residents, and to transfer the land to the National Park Service (NPS) as addition to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. # DOI, contingent upon appropriation of all necessary funds, to build a replacement park road around the north side of Fontana Lake. In 1944, Fontana Dam was completed and Fontana Lake was formed; also by this time, the TVA had fulfilled all its obligations under the agreement. After World War II, construction began on the western segment, completed in 1948. In 1958, North Carolina completed work on Fontana Road (SR 1364), which ends at the National Park boundary. In 1960, construction began on the eastern segment, where crews quickly ran into unstable rock. In 1962, after the first was nearly completed, a letter from the Bureau of Public Roads asked Conrad L. Wirth, then director of the NPS, to \\"seriously reconsider\\" the plan and said that the road would become costly with damage to the area's landscape. Construction was halted by 1971, after the completion of the road tunnel and Noland Creek bridge. After $4.1 million spent on the road, environmental concerns became a pressing matter because of exposed Anakeesta rock and the possibility that the mild acid that comes from the rock could leak into nearby streams, damaging plants and fish. In 1983, a lawsuit brought by a group of Swain County residents to force the NPS to resume construction ended when the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit concluded that the 1943 agreement to construct the road had not been breached by DOI as Congress had not appropriated funds for the completion of the road. The court also held that DOI was under no obligation to seek further appropriations for the completion of the road. Things remained idle until 2001, when NC Representative Charles H. Taylor inserted $16 million into the Federal Highway Administration appropriation to resume work on the road. An Environmental impact statement (EIS) was soon performed to evaluate a range of alternatives that could resolve the DOI's obligations under the 1943 agreement. The EIS resulted in a NPS Record of Decision (ROD) on December 28, 2007 that payment of a monetary settlement to Swain County, in lieu of further construction, was the alternative that would best protect the resources of the park. Negotiations soon followed, which were aided by NC Representative Heath Shuler and TN Senator Lamar Alexander. On February 6, 2010, all signatories met in Bryson City and executed a new agreement that explicitly extinguished the 1943 agreement. It called for a cash settlement of $52 million, paid to Swain County, by on or before December 31, 2020. Upon complete settlement, all remaining obligations that remain are considered fulfilled. Swain County had received $12.8 million so far and used interest on that money for county needs. In April 2016, Swain County commissioners filed a lawsuit against the federal government asking for the remaining $29.2 million still owed to the county. The federal government takes the position that the agreement does not require payment until 2020. On April 24, 2017, Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims dismissed the lawsuit but the county has asked for reconsideration. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke released $4 million on September 7, 2017. The final installment of $35.2 million was paid on June 29, 2018. However, under the 2010 agreement, the money was deposited with the state treasurer's office. Swain County can spend only the interest the money earns.

He was the first Asian American elected to the Florida House of Representatives. Gong was born in Miami to Chinese immigrant parents, who worked as grocers ultimately creating a chain of mom-and-pop grocery stores in the Overtown section of Miami. An attorney, he was an alumnus of Harvard University and the University of Miami School of Law. As a member of the Democratic party he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and was elected to the State Senate in 1966 and served until 1972.  Early Life and Family  In 1915, at the age of 15, Gong's father immigrated to the U.S. going to Tifton, Georgia to work in his father's laundry. He returned to China to marry in 1925. Gong stated, \\"as Daddy used to say, the soil was getting pretty barren and not so productive, and they all wanted to come to the 'golden mountain' that was the name for America.\\" Gong's father was politically conscious and voted in every election. It was this spirit and his father's encouragement that led Eddie and his four sisters to be politically active in high school. At Miami High School, Gong was elected president of the student body. In 1947 he was elected to Boys State and in the same year became president of Boys Nation. Gong won a scholarship to Harvard University from the Harvard Club of Miami and graduated cum laude in political science in 1952. With his father's encouragement Eddie and his four sisters were encouraged to become well rounded students. His four sisters would go on to all graduate from college, the first in their family. Two of the sisters became physicians. They all supported Eddie in his law school career. He graduated from the University of Miami School of Law in 1960. Eddie said of his father, \\"he believed in education because he didn't have one\\".  Early career  Following college Gong moved to Hong Kong working as a journalist at the Hong Kong Tiger Standard. While there he met and married Sophie Valchos. Deciding on a career in law, Gong moved back to the United States where he worked as a reporter at the Miami Herald while attending the University of Miami School of Law. Gong graduated in 1960. After a short time in private practice he met then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy who offered him a position with the Justice Department in Washington. Gong turned him down citing a desire not to be separated from his family. Kennedy then appointed him assistant U.S. attorney which allowed him to remain in Miami.  Florida Politics  During the 1960s Gong's name became well known and his passion for public service coincided with Florida's reapportionment which created new seats in the Legislature. He filed to run for state Representative and was elected in 1963.Gong was called ‚Äúone of Dade County‚Äôs most popular politicians.‚Äù In 1947 he met two fellow participants at Florida's Boys State, William \\"Wig\\" D. Barrow and Lawton Chiles. All three were elected to the Florida Senate in 1966. Chiles went on to represent Florida in the U.S. Senate (1970-1989) and serve as Governor (1991-1998). Gong and Chiles maintained a lifelong friendship. In 1963 Gong was the first man of Chinese ancestry elected to the Florida House of Representatives where he served until 1966 when he ran and was elected to the Florida Senate. Gong and Chiles worked on what is now known as Florida's Government in the Sunshine Law.  Rules For Future Politicians  In her book Florida's Minority Trailblazers Dr. Susan A.

I mean, here we had the grocery store in the black ghetto--that's what you would call it,\\" he said. \\" It could only happen in America. My father, my grandfather, all had to come half way around the globe for us to have a chance because we wouldn't have had this chance.

Many of his scholarly articles focused on the taxonomy of the family Parmeliaceae. Hale was one of the first lichen experts to incorporate secondary chemistry and technology such as computers and scanning electron microscopy into taxonomic work. Mason Hale published approximately two hundred articles and books on various aspects of lichen biology including taxonomy, anatomy, chemistry, and ecology. Hale also wrote several books aimed at education and increasing accessibility to lichens. Early Life and education Mason Hale Jr. grew up on a farm outside of Winsted, Connecticut. He had an affinity towards biology from experiences from living on his family's farm. As an undergraduate, Hale wanted to be a linguist, but was not able to take specialized classes. Instead, he earned an undergraduate degree studying biology at Yale University, where he studied lichens under Alexander W. Evans, a bryophyte and lichen expert. Hale earned his Masters and Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of prominent lichenologist John W. Thomson, an arctic lichen expert. For his master's degree, Hale studied the lichen flora of the Baffin Islands, located in northeastern Canada. He collected lichens on the island working with Pierre Dansereau, a prominent Canadian ecologist. The resulting publications from the Baffin Islands contained both a checklist of all species collected, and dichotomous keys. Baffin Island was the first of many expeditions around the world that Hale made to collect lichens. For his Ph.D. Hale studied the lichens of southern Wisconsin. The paper, which was published in the journal Ecology, exemplifies Hale's ability to use technology to innovate new ideas. He studied how cryptogam communities (lichens and bryophytes) change with differing forest composition. He also examined host specificity of species. Hale found that there are different communities at the base of the tree compared to 1.3 meters high on the tree trunk. Another significant finding was that the cryptogamic community differed between habitats due to light and other stand level variables. This was an important study because it was one of the first lichen experiments that utilized statistics for ecological conclusions as opposed to observations. Also Hale placed the data for each tree on IBM punch cards to better analyze the data. Hale met his wife Beatrice Wilde, an ecologist, while at the University of Wisconsin. They married in 1952 and had three children, Janet, Sandra and Robert. Hale also befriended William Culberson, a fellow graduate student, and later a lichen expert at Duke University. Hale and Culberson collaborated on many chemistry and taxonomic endeavors including the first lichen checklist of North America. After earning his Ph.D., Hale worked for two years each at University of Wichita and University of West Virginia. Then he became an Associate Curator at the Smithsonian Institution, where he worked from 1957 until his death. In 33 years at the Smithsonian, Hale collected close to 80,000 specimens and made the Smithsonian Institution one of the largest lichen herbariums in the world. Hale made numerous expeditions to tropical regions including the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa. One of his favorite expeditions was to collect endolithic lichens in Antarctica. Hale was later appointed a Senior Botanist at the Smithsonian. Advances in chemistry and technology Mason Hale was primarily a taxonomist, but his taxonomic framework and methodology for describing new species was dependent on modern technology. Hale was one of the first lichen experts to use chemical tests to study species delineations. He learned the techniques from his professor at Yale University, Alexander W. Evans. The techniques that he utilized included spot tests, early thin layer chromatography, and fluorescence (turning of color with UV light). Hale both cataloged the presence of chemicals from numerous North American species and described new chemicals. One example, is Hale's study on fluorescence in which he linked fluoresced colors to specific chemicals using paper chromatography. In addition to chemistry, Hale also incorporated scanning electron microscopy characteristics such as cortical structure into his species concepts. Another technical advance Hale utilized was punch card computers to keep track of morphological and ecological data. The use of computers was especially important to keep track of the many traits and taxonomic revisions in the Parmeliaceae. Taxonomic works Mason Hale was an expert of the Parmeliaceae, a large family of foliose lichens. Hale wrote numerous monographs and articles describing new genera and species. Before Hale, Parmelia was a large genus containing a wide range of morphological traits. Hale became interested in the Parmeliaceae because there was a number of undescribed species in the southeastern United States. Hale revised the family three times. The first time required reviewing type specimens and collected material to examine subgeneric concepts and synonyms. The second and third revisions broke the subgenera into more specific genera based on differences in chemistry and morphological characteristics using scanning electron microscopy. While initially met with resistance, most of the taxonomic changes are now widely accepted. Hale's taxonomic divisions are considered to be one of his most important contribution to lichenology.Bruce McCune,personal communication, November 2014 Hale also widely collected and described crustose lichens in the Graphidaceae and Thelotremataceae (now synonymized with Graphidaceae). Ecology Hale pioneered numerous ecological measurements with lichens. In addition to his work on community ecology of lichens, Hale examined the yearly growth rate of lichens in Aton Forest. Hale also examined use of lichens as an indicator of floods and high water. Lastly in the 1980s Hale and James Lawrey published articles examining how car exhaust (specifically the lead in the exhaust) negatively affects lichen growth. Education and outreach Hale also wrote or co-authored books that helped to introduce lichens to the general public and keep scientists abreast of current theory. These books contained keys to genera and species such as How to know the LichensHale, ME. 1979. How to know the lichens. WC Brown Co.Hale, ME. 1969. How to know the lichens. WC Brown Co. and Lichens of California.Hale ME. 1988. Lichens of California. Univ of California Press. An important symposia on current topics was The Lichens.Ahmadjian V, Hale ME. 1973. The lichens. Academic Press. Introductory texts to lichen study include Biology of Lichens.Hale, ME. 1967 Biology of lichens. Hale and Culberson also compiled the first checklist to North American lichens and lichenicolous fungi in 1956. Lastly, Hale and his son printed the newsletters for the International Association for Lichenology on old printing presses and made the typesetting by hand.Sipman, H., Seaward, M. 1990. Mason E.

Birchfield Jr. (December 19, 1935 ‚Äì February 5, 2016) was an American politician, lawyer, and civic leader in Jacksonville, Florida. He referred to himself as the \\"Duke of Mayo\\" from the small town (population less than 1,000) where he was born and raised.  Early life and education  Birchfield was born in Mayo, Florida, and graduated from Lafayette High School in 1954. He attended the University of Florida, majoring in agriculture, and was a member of Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, Phi Kappa Phi, and Florida Blue Key. Birchfield was named to the UF Hall of Fame in 1957, earned his bachelor's degree in 1958, then enlisted in the United States Navy. Birchfield decided to further his education and was accepted by the Fredric G. Levin College of Law at the University of Florida, where he was a member of Phi Delta Phi and earned his Juris Doctor in 1963. He was admitted to the Florida Bar on June 12, 1964. He was honored as a Distinguished Alumnus by the University of Florida in 1989.  Career  Birchfield began his law practice in 1964 with Milam, LeMaistre, Ramsay & Martin in Jacksonville and joined the Jacksonville Bar Association. He maintained membership in Jacksonville Area Legal Aid and served on their board of directors. He also belonged to the American Board of Trial Advocates. An obituary in The Florida Times-Union described him as follows: \\"W.O. was well known for his sound professional judgment grounded in pragmatic reality. He used a near legendary, finely honed sense of humor with pointedly relevant political witticisms to find solutions to seemingly intractable political and legal problems\\". Over his career, he was approved to practice before several Federal Jurisdictions, including the U. S. District Courts for the Middle District of Florida, the Northern District of Florida, and the United States Supreme Court. In response to the Yates Manifesto, the 1965 Florida Legislature created the Local Government Study Commission. J. J. Daniel was named chairman, and he convinced Birchfield to join the group. Over 15 months they developed a document entitled Blueprint for Improvement, a plan for achieving consolidation of the Jacksonville City and Duval County governments. The plan was placed on a 1967 referendum and approved by Jacksonville voters. On October 1, 1968, the Jacksonville Consolidation was implemented.  Political career  In the late 1960s Birchfield worked with the Duval County legislative delegation and became interested in politics. He successfully campaigned for the Florida House of Representatives as a Democrat representing the 21st district. In his first year, he helped pass a no-fault insurance bill and was assigned to several committees, including the Insurance Committee chairmanship. Among the 34 new legislators in 1971, he was selected \\"the most promising\\" and noted for his sarcastic wit. During a particularly pointless debate, he was quoted as saying, \\"Inasmuch as we have lost sight of our objective, let us redouble our efforts to get there\\". He was reelected to a second two-year term and served from 1971 to 1974. After his second term ended, he joined the established Martin & Ade partnership to form Martin, Ade, Birchfield & Johnson in 1974. In 1988 it was renamed Martin, Ade, Birchfield & Mickler. At its height, the firm employed 23 attorneys and was the seventh-ranked law firm in Jacksonville, specializing in corporate law.  Jacksonville Transportation Authority  After leaving politics, Birchfield was appointed to the Jacksonville Transportation Authority Board of Directors. = Dames Point Bridge = Birchfield was a part of the group that pushed to construct the Dames Point Bridge despite detractors who said the bridge wasn't necessary. Its official name was the Napoleon Bonaparte Broward Bridge, but critics called it the \\"bridge to nowhere\\". At the time, the only way to cross the St. Johns River from north Arlington or the beaches was the unpredictable Mayport Ferry or a long, circular route through downtown. Birchfield and the JTA board realized that tremendous growth was happening to the east of the downtown area all the way to the Jacksonville Beaches. At the time of Birchfield's death, the bridge had become an integral part of the Interstate 295 East Beltway. = Butler Boulevard = In the 1970s, there were only two east-west roads to the beaches, Atlantic Boulevard and Beach Boulevard. Each had traffic signals at every major intersection, creating a long, inefficient commute for beach residents. Birchfield and the JTA board proposed a limited-access expressway named J Turner Butler Boulevard. The position of the new road ran about two miles south of Beach Boulevard, but the route was through mostly undeveloped land. Like the bridge, critics called it \\"the road to nowhere\\". Construction began in 1978 from Philips Highway eastward and the first section opened the following year. Development grew as each new interchange opened. The final section, terminating at Florida State Road A1A was not completed until 1997. By then, growth along Butler and at the beach had turned the highway into a major commuter route, requiring a third lane in each direction, plus extended on and off ramps. Birchfield remained on the board for eight years, including time as chairman. = Jacksonville Skyway = In the early 1970s, Federal grant money was available from the Urban Mass Transit Administration for people mover projects. The Florida Department of Transportation began working with the Jacksonville Transportation Authority to submit an application for Downtown Jacksonville. JTA Chairman Birchfield and the board endorsed the idea, pursued it, and received a $23.5 million grant for the initial construction of the Jacksonville Skyway, a monorail. After leaving the JTA board, Birchfield represented vendor Westinghouse Electric Corp. during contract negotiations with JTA.  Jacksonville Port Authority  After leaving the JTA board, Birchfield was appointed to the Jacksonville Port Authority board of directors for a 4-year term and served as chairman in 1985. That year, he was honored by the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce with their \\"Outstanding Political Leader\\" award. He continued to promote construction of Butler Boulevard, the Dames Point Bridge, and the downtown Skyway.  Last affiliations  Birchfield and several other attorneys left the Martin, Ade, Birchfield & Mickler firm in 2000, joining McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe. On January 8, 2001, Martin, Ade, Birchfield & Mickler officially closed. Ten months later, Birchfield joined Lewis, Longman & Walker to concentrate on eminent domain and land-use issues. In 2004, he and Bruce Humphrey formed Birchfield & Humphrey, P.A. Both attorneys were identified as among the best lawyers in their specialty by the rating service \\"Super Lawyers\\". Birchfield remained active as a lawyer until shortly before his death.  Civic involvement  Birchfield shared his time and knowledge with numerous civic groups, including the presidency of the Meninak Club, the Greater Jacksonville Agricultural Fair Association, the River Club of Jacksonville, Leadership Jacksonville, the Child Guidance Center of Jacksonville, Public television station WJCT, Jacksonville Legal Aid and the Jacksonville Community Council, Inc. Personal life Birchfield married the former Anne Layton in 1960 and the couple had four children: Margaret (Meg), Mary Anne, Frank and William III. They divorced on January 17, 1996. On December 11, 1997 he and Dana Lynn Ferrell were married and remained together until his death in 2016.

Its route connects Ridgefield, Danbury, Bethel and Redding. The Ives Trail is named after Charles Ives, a Danbury-born American modernist composer. The Ives Trail is maintained largely through the efforts of the Ives Trail and Regional Greenway Association. Trail description View from Moses Mountain The Ives Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking and picnicking. The trail passes through both public and private lands. Sections of the trail may be used by bicycles and horses. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on any section of the trail. The trail goes over several significant steep areas and is rugged in places. Parts of it are not suitable for casual hikers. =Trail route= The trail goes from Bennett's Pond in Ridgefield to the Hemlock Hills open space into the western section of Wooster Mountain State Park, crosses Rt 7 at a crosswalk, enters the eastern section of Wooster Mountain State Park, goes through an easement area and into Tarrywile Park. From Tarrywile Park it goes through several easement areas and emerges onto Long Ridge Road. From Long Ridge Road it enters another easement area and eventually into the Terre Haute property of Bethel and Redding Open Space. The easement areas do not permit bikes. =Trail communities= The Ives Trail is entirely within the state of Connecticut and passes through the towns of Ridgefield, Danbury, Bethel and Redding. Landscape, geology, and natural environment The terrain is variable throughout the length of the trail, including rolling hills, open fields, rugged steep sections, cliffs and overlooks.

He specialized in figure painting and engravings. He was best known for his Irish genre studies, and paintings of Irish households. Early life Helmick was born in Zanesville, Ohio, in 1840. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Peter Rothermel. He then moved to Paris in 1854 and trained alongside Henry Bacon at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, under the artist Alexandre Cabanel. \\"He devoted himself to genre painting, using as topics for his greatest works the scenes from peasant life of Ireland. In this particular style of work he became famous. He gained admission to the Beaux Arts, the most famous school of art in Paris, being the second foreigner who was ever received there\\".Helmick Dies After Much Ill Health, The Washington Times, Monday, April 29, 1907, cit., p. 8. He also presented his paintings at the Paris Salon. He then moved to London in 1872. Life in London Helmick lived in London for 15 years, from 1872 to 1887. He would regularly visit Ireland to make paintings on rural Irish life, and Irish households, from his studios at the counties Cork and Galway. Throughout his stretch in London, he repeatedly exhibited in a number of Art societies, such as London‚Äôs Royal Academy, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, the Royal Society of Painters-Etchers and Engravers, the Society of British Artists, and the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham. He also exhibited his works at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and Manchester City Art Gallery. Thus, he became established as a painter and etcher and was elected a member of Society of British Artists in 1879, and the Royal Society of Painters-Etchers and Engravers in 1881. In London, Helmick became friendly with the famous painter James Whistler, who was the President of the Society of British Artists. Around 1880, Helmick expressed his appreciation for Whistler‚Äôs works, like his Etchings of Venice and Venice Pastels, both exhibited at the Fine Art Society, London. In 1878, James Whistler had created his Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2: Portrait of Thomas Carlyle, engraved by Richard Josey. In 1881, a set of 'Six portraits of T. Carlyle', etched in a rather naive style by Helmick, were published by the Etcher's Society in Arundell Street, Haymarket. Helmick and Whistler‚Äôs mutual interests and involvements in such etchings, and print publications, provided them with points of contact and likely brought them together. Their friendship was strong enough for Whistler to suggest that Helmick live in the same building as him, on Tite Street, in 1881. Helmick's friendship with Whistler increased his fame, and his paintings would demand high prices at London's Royal Academy. Life in Washington, D.C. Helmick moved to Washington, D.C., in 1887. There he was active in the Society of Washington Artists, the Washington Water Color Club and the Washington Society of Fine Arts. As a Professor of the Philosophy and History of Art, Helmick taught painting and drawing at the Art Students League of Washington, at Georgetown University and in his Georgetown studio. He simultaneously exhibited at the national Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Brooklyn Art Association. He was even represented at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Helmick also contributed illustrations to The Century Magazine and Harper‚Äôs Magazine and is represented in the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Museum of American Art. Starting from May 29, 1901, and following days, a collection of paintings and drawings made by his students of the private class, both male and female, which he directed in own home in Georgetown, was exhibited in the Veerhoff's Galleries (Washington, D.C.); with regard to this exhibit, Misses K. Lewars, R. McGowan and Candida Colosimo showed all their talent.Cf. Art Notes, The Evening Star, Saturday, June 1, 1901, p. 24. Also among Helmick's pupils was the noted miniaturist Margaret Foote Hawley. Death Helmick died at his residence, 3259 N Street NW, after a long period of ill health on 28 April 1907 in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., at the age of 62. His funeral was held two days later in the Holy Trinity Catholic Church (Washington, D.C.) and he was buried in Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.).Cf. Helmick Dies After Much Ill Health, The Washington Times, Monday, April 29, 1907, p. 8. Style and technique Helmick was best known for his oil on canvas paintings that were based on rural Irish life. He developed this preference from his regular visits to Ireland, when living in London. He was the foremost artist among a small set of painters focusing on rural Irish culture, and was hailed by contemporary critics as ‚Äòan American Wilkie‚Äô. His surviving paintings on the Catholic peasantry, their households, priests, doctors, and the arrangement of their marriages give an insight into his sympathetic and realistic attitude and viewpoint. His paintings tended to be intricately detailed when depicting the items lying around Irish households, such as the cutlery, the crockery and the flax spinning wheels. These demonstrated his keen observational skills.Cf. F. E. Y., Artist Helmick Unsung In His Own Country, The Washington Times, Wednesday, January 28, 1914, p. 9.

Curcio (born September 1, 1980) is an American author, public speaker, and convicted robber. In 2008, Curcio was responsible for one of the most elaborately planned armored car heists in U.S. history. He was eventually arrested and sentenced to six years in federal prison. Upon his release from prison he has devoted his life to working with youth in the field of drug abuse and crime prevention, speaking to students and athletes across the U.S. He has been featured in GQ, Esquire, 20/20, Fox News, NPR and NBC among others.  Early life  Curcio was born and raised in Monroe, Washington. As a teenager, he was popular and talented and voted captain of both football and basketball teams at Monroe High School. Curcio broke many records in football and received several honors and awards for his play in both sports. Curcio would later go on to play football at his father's alma mater, the University of Idaho, which had been his childhood dream. While returning a punt in practice, Curcio tore his anterior cruciate ligament, ending his promising college football career and introducing him to the powerful pain killer Vicodin. Curcio quickly became addicted to the prescription pills. Soon after, he began experiencing withdrawals and even injured himself intentionally by kicking an oak coffee table repeatedly in order to obtain more pills. With family pressure, Curcio agreed to enter a drug/alcohol treatment facility. After completing a 21-day in-patient program, Curcio, now sober, started his first business, called \\"Tony‚Äôs Gaming\\", which bought and sold casino tables and other gaming merchandise. Curcio expanded his business by leasing a commercial space and adjacent storage. Within a few months of being open to the public, Tony's Gaming was unexpectedly shut down. The Washington State Gambling Commission and local police raided Tony's Gaming and confiscated the inventory, stating that Curcio did not possess the proper permits. Under increasing financial pressure, Curcio relapsed and began forging prescriptions on his computer. He later became aware that the police raid was due to influence from a real estate broker who had financial interest in a local casino. Curcio attempted to retain legal representation in the case but was denied services by local attorneys already debriefed by the real estate broker/casino owner. Curcio and several of his associates retaliated against the casino owner by breaking into his businesses and removing computers, files and documents from the offices he owned. Curcio continued to maintain an outward appearance that resembled a successful business owner and family man. He graduated from college, married his high school sweetheart, had two daughters and would later own a real estate investment company based in Seattle, Washington. Anthony Curcio under the surveillance of the FBI However, he was living two different lives. As his addiction progressed, so did his involvement in illegal activities. By his mid 20s, Curcio had already organized several high-dollar thefts, scams, and loan-sharking schemes, and was also behind a sports memorabilia counterfeiting ring. Despite having completed four drug and alcohol treatment programs, ABC News stated that Curcio was spending nearly $15,000 a month on his increasing drug habit which now also included cocaine and benzodiazepines. Curcio's real estate investment business took a heavy downturn when the economy collapsed in 2008, leaving him with several homes on the verge of foreclosure and vehicles near repossession among other outstanding personal debts. With assets and bank accounts depleting, Curcio hatched the idea to rob a Brink's armored car.  Brink's robbery  For three months, Curcio observed a Brink's armored car as it made deliveries to the Bank of America branch in Monroe, Washington. He took notes of the schedule, diagrammed locations of the bank's cameras, and noted the armored car's blind spots. He also estimated how much money was being transferred to the bank and how much was being removed via ATMs. He considered police protocol in responding to robberies and the location of the bank and decided on using a local creek to escape. After weeks of hand-dredging the creek in Woods Creek and a failed practice attempt at using a jet ski for the getaway, he changed his approach and created a cable pulley system to quickly pull himself, and large bags of cash, upstream using a connected canvas- wrapped inner tube. Curcio's planning culminated with an advertisement he placed on Craigslist a few days before the robbery. The online ad sought 15 to 20 workers for a fictitious city cleanup project, promising $28.50 an hour. The laborers were told to wear jeans, a blue shirt, work shoes, and a yellow safety vest. The ad also told the applicants they needed to bring safety goggles and a painter's mask. The ad directed them to meet in the Bank of America parking lot at the exact time Curcio planned to rob the armored car. The Brink's armored car after the robbery (September 30, 2008) On September 30, 2008, Curcio, dressed identically to his decoy applicants, pretended to work the grounds near the bank. Wearing a blue shirt, jeans, yellow safety vest, work boots, and painter's mask, he pepper-sprayed the Brink's armored car guard who was pushing a dolly loaded with money into the bank. The pepper spray forced the guard to reach for his eyes and release the cart that held the money. Curcio grabbed two bags of money, containing more than $400,000, and ran toward the creek. Meanwhile, police arrived to find the bank's parking lot filled with men matching the robber's description. At the water's edge, Curcio threw the money into the inner tube and pulled himself down the creek with the cables he had previously strung. He traveled about 200 yards upstream and exited the creek behind several businesses on the opposite side of the highway from the bank. Curcio removed his wig and worker's clothing that had been attached by Velcro, revealing different attire underneath. He climbed into the trunk of a getaway vehicle driven by an associate and left. Curcio's careful planning and unusual getaway gained national attention. The timing of the robbery came days after announcements of the government's bank bailout package that included Bank of America. The unique robbery techniques gained notoriety for the mysterious robber who was referred to as the \\"Craigslist Robber\\" and \\"D.B. Tuber\\", after the 1970s hijacker D. B. Cooper.  Arrest  Curcio's undoing would come a month later when a homeless man reported to police that several weeks before the robbery he had seen a man drive up to the Bank of America parking lot and retrieve a disguise from behind a trash bin. The man found it suspicious enough to write down the license plate number of the car which he later provided to police. The car was registered to Curcio. What the man had seen was one of Curcio's practice runs to ensure proper timing of the heist. After Curcio returned from a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, the FBI began their surveillance of him as a suspect in the robbery. Local authorities retrieved his DNA from a drink bottle disposed of by Curcio at a gas station and compared it to the DNA from the face mask and wig discarded a short distance from the scene of the robbery. The DNA samples matched and Curcio was arrested in Lake Stevens, Washington getting out of a luxury SUV with $17,000 in cash. With only circumstantial evidence connecting Curcio to the crime, he initially bonded out, but a month later (January 2009), his bond was revoked and he was returned to custody after being suspected of witness tampering. Later details would reveal that $220,000 was recovered after an associate of Curcio's came forward to make a deal with the FBI and local police. Curcio refused to cooperate with authorities and no other charges were ever filed against any of Curcio's unnamed co-conspirators. All of the money except for what Curcio paid the getaway driver and other accomplices was eventually recovered.  Prison  George Jung and Curcio in La Tuna, Federal Prison Curcio was sentenced to 72 months in federal prison and served his time in FCI Big Spring, FCI La Tuna and Coleman Correctional Complex. While being housed in FCI La Tuna, Curcio became close with fellow inmate George Jung. Jung encouraged Curcio to write a book, and put him in touch with author/biographer Dane Batty. The two soon began correspondence. During this time, Curcio was with two inmates who had previously assaulted another inmate. While prison authorities knew Curcio was not involved in the attack, authorities still held him ‚Äòunder investigation‚Äô until the case had been resolved. Curcio spent seven months in solitary confinement for this affiliation. In solitary, he received beatings, witnessed suicides and would have cockroaches crawl all over his body at night. Upon his release, he wrote the book Heist and High, promising to prevent others from making the same decisions he had made. Throughout the duration of his sentence, Curcio wrote and illustrated over 20 children's books, including one aimed at the children of incarcerated parents titled My Daddy‚Äôs in Jail. Curcio finished his incarceration at USP Coleman in Florida, where he completed a drug-treatment program and was released from custody April 2013.  Release  Curcio was released April 4, 2013 and returned to the Seattle area, reuniting with his wife and two daughters. He has since been working with youth and giving presentations regarding drug abuse prevention and the importance of making positive choices. He speaks to middle schools, high schools and universities across the U.S. Curcio has been featured on several media platforms using his story to increase awareness regarding addiction. His book, Heist and High (Nish Publishing, 286 pages), was released June 21, 2013 and has been the recipient of several awards.

Tex arrives at the ranch only to find Kirby swinging from a rope. He heads into town and asks for work at the saloon. He's directed to Sile Doty's ranch, who is Montgomery's foreman. When he arrives at the Doty ranch, he meets his former sister-in-law, Paca, who greets him by name. It is then that Tex is revealed to be Kirby's brother, a former Texas Ranger. She explains that she is now the property of Doty since once Kirby was murdered Doty claimed her. She begs Tex to get out of town, but he's bent on revenge. Tex hangs out at the Montgomery ranch, waiting for him to return so he can avenge his innocent brother's death, after Montgomery leaves Hanna alone to survey some of his property. Tarp and his father are supposed to ride to the survey site to warn Montgomery that Tex is coming for him. As they realize the Indians are massing, and there's a good chance Montgomery will be killed, they decide to head to his ranch and claim Hannah. Both argue over who gets her. Tarp, his father, and the town gambler descend on the Montgomery ranch in an effort to be the first to lay claim to her as the Indians gather to avenge Five Crow's death. As the men fight over her, Hannah ultimately realizes that Tarp Penny was the one who attacked her that night. Tex watches the scene unfold and ends up taking Hanna away for her own protection. Meanwhile, Doty arrives with Paca at the survey site and warns Montgomery that Tex is waiting for him at his ranch and the Indians are out for blood. Montgomery tells Paca to talk to the chief and guarantee his freedom to return to his ranch where he will give them the man that murdered Five Crows; if she won't help, he'll have her killed. He plans to frame Tex instead. Paca returns to her tribe to talk to the chief. Tarp kills the gambler, his father, (who also had designs on her) and wounds Hannah in the shoulder after chasing her and taking a shot at Tex. Tarp ends up in a shootout with Tex that turns into a violent fistfight after both run out of ammunition. Tex prevails when Tarp is accidentally impaled on a bison head's horns when it is knocked off the wall. Montgomery is intercepted by an Indian party and taken to the chief. The chief promises to allow him to return to his ranch \\"after the ceremony.\\" His body is dragged back to his ranch and Paca (now wearing Indian garb) rides off with the tribe, having avenged her husband's death. As Tex begins to ride away from the ranch, he turns and offers Hannah a chance to join him. She doesn't have to think twice, since the rest of the town's men will inevitably descend on the ranch like a cloud of locusts seeking her and her property.

Pender, PhD, RN, FAAN earned her BS in 1964 and her MA in 1965 from Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI. She received a PhD. from Northwestern University of Evanston, IL in 1969. She was a nurse educator for over 40 years. During her doctoral studies, Pender became interested in health promotion. She said that she was influenced by a doctoral advisor named James Hall, who studied how people's thoughts shape their motivations and behaviors. In 1982, Pender published her Health Promotion Model. She has also written a textbook, Health Promotion in Nursing Practice; several editions of the book have been published. Her publications include eight textbooks and 50 scholarly writings. She married Albert Pender, a business and economics professor. They had two children. Pender was named a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing in 2012. The award has only been given to a few dozen nurses who have made exceptional contributions to the profession. Pender was president of the academy from 1991 to 1993.  Health promotion model theory  Pender's health promotion model theory was first published in 1982 and later revised in 1996 and 2002. It is used for nursing research, education, and practice. Research has been conducted on the model since its inception. 250 articles have been published in the English language that use or apply Pender‚Äôs HPM. Directed at improving an overall sense of well-being, Pender‚Äôs model considers the holistic needs of each individual and their relationship with the environment to predict and explain health promoting behaviors. The purpose of the model is to assist nurses in understanding factors that affect health-promoting behaviors. The model provides eight components for the nurse to evaluate. The health promotion model is based on eight key components of nursing: # person # environment # health # illnesses # individual characteristics and experiences # behavior-specific cognitions and affect # behavioral outcome.

Location  Lydia Escher's (1858‚Äì1891) grandfather Heinrich Escher (1776‚Äì1853) had built the country house Belvoir, situated on the left shore of Z√ºrichsee in the then village of Enge, as of today being a district of the city of Z√ºrich. The area houses the Hotelfachschule Belvoirpark and is one of the largest public parks in Z√ºrich. Public transport is provided by the Z√ºrich Tram route 7 and by the bus lines 161 and 165.  History  Heinrich Escher bought in 1826 the so-called ¬´Wyssb√ºhel¬ª, a vine-covered hill on Z√ºrichsee lakeshore. According to his own plans, the top of the hill was removed and the material used for populations on the swampy banks. The area was planted with exotic trees, which partly came from Northern America. The High Neoclassical mansion in the centre of the complex was built between 1828 and 1831. Heinrich Escher, Lydia Zolliker and their children Clementina and Alfred Escher (1819‚Äì1882) were the first inhabitants, establishing the Escher's family tradition to Alred's daughter Lydia Escher to 1890. In addition to his scientific collections and studies, Heinrich Escher dedicated himself especially the design and maintenance of his estate, which he called Belvoir (beautiful view in French). On occasion of the construction of the so-called linksufrige Seeuferbahn (literally: left lakeside railway) in 1872, the spacious estate lost the direct access to the lake. Alfred Escher died in 1882, and he inherited the estate to his daughter Lydia; after her suicide in 1891, the estate was the base to establish the Gottfried Keller Foundation and was bequeathed to the Swiss Confederation (Eidgenossenschaft). The Federal Council acted as the administrator of the foundation, and planned to sell the estate, to meet Lydia Escher's conditions attached to the gift. When this became known, prominent Z√ºrich citizens formed a committee to save the park for the public use. As the city government was unable to raise the money to buy the estarte, the city's population bought shares for the rescue of the park, and within some days the required capital was provided. To finance the maintenance, the Belvoirpark-society (Belvoirpark-Gesellschaft) sold along the Seestrasse road some building plots. In 1901 the city of Z√ºrich was able to take over the property, and thanked its citizens to have prevent the appalling loss of unsheathed. The villa was rebuilt in 1925 to host the then Hotel- und Wirtefachschule mit Restaurantbetrieb Belvoir. As of today, the villa also is used by the Wollishofen guild, but it primarily houses the restaurant Belvoir Park which is operated by the students of the hotel management school Belvoirpark Hotelfachschule.  Belvoirpark  The Belvoirpark is one of Z√ºrich's earliest landscape gardens and attracted much admiration on the occasion of its opening. At that time, both its location with magnificent views of the city, the lake and the mountains, as well the varied and exciting terrain design and the present, exceptionally crafted arboretum, attracted. In 1881, a double row of Populus trees marked the access to the villa, which led to the greenhouse and the stables. On the highest point of the area, the villa is situated, nestled in large groups of trees. The parterre of flowers with Banana palms, fountain and carpet beds extends in the southeasterly direction. At its southern end, at the edge of the artificially flattened hilltop, lake and mountains can be seen. A large vegetable garden completes the park in the southwestern corner with the economics building. The childhood friend of Lydia Escher's husband, Karl Stauffer-Bern, was allowed to set up a studio in the greenhouse of the Belvoirpark in 1886. In 1889 Stauffer initiated the idea, to re-design the park after Italian landscapes and architecture. When the work was nearly completed, the family planned to move to Italy, and Lydia and her husband traveled to Florence, where they were looking for a new property with the help of Stauffer. Among the various specimens, there are Acer buergeranum, Magnolia √ó soulangeana, Rhododendron, Ginkgo biloba, Carya, Campsis radicans, Abies cephalonica, Abies pinsapo and Podocarpus chinensis. In 1895, a project was implemented by Evariste Mertens comprising a Baroque jewelry investment with lawn tennis courts and a generous croquet square. Fourteen years later a heated pond to the presentation of tropical aquatic plants was installed, being a reminiscent of the jungle-like structures of the Brissago Islands. The border and scenic shore planting mark the transition into the native flora with subtropical and some flowering plants. The transformation of the flower terrace was done in 1923. A larger well should be built, and Hermann Haller created a bronze sculpture on the base of the old fountain. In 1933, the largest rebuilt of the park took place with the extension of the Alfred- Escher-Strasse to Wollishofen, therefore in the north an area of 1,500 square meters and in the south around 2,100 square meters went lost. The Chestnut as well as the Elm trees had been cut without substitution, the tennis courts disappeared, and a new entrance was built. Only the lakeside entrance to the Park still corresponds to the park borders around 1830.

On occasion of the G59 exhibition, the central puplic square in the garden was rebuilt, and the free- standing wall with the Pergola at the lily pool and the Iridae gardens establisblished. In 1985, the garden area with the Irideae, the so-called Irisgarten, was redesigned by Walter Frischknecht. About 120 different types of Iridae bloom from March (miniature Iris) until July (Iris barbata), and there grow, among many others, Iris pseudacorus and Peony.  Cultural heritage of national importance  The area of the park and the mansion and assiciotaed buildings are listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance. The associated buildings, the former stables and the greenhouse, are not publicly accessible.  Literature  * Gartenbiografien: Orte erz√§hlen. vdf Hochschulverlag AG, ETH Z√ºrich, Z√ºrich 2013, .

Biography  Eric Chang was born in East Java on February 1990. His father is a sculptor, and his mother, a ceramic designer and entrepreneur.  Photography career  At 15 years old, he became the official photographer for Addie MS‚Äô Twilite Orchestra and quickly became an award-winning photographer working with Indonesia‚Äôs top celebrities and public figures including: Krisdayanti, Luna Maya, and Sebastian Gunawan. When he was 18 years old, he had his first solo exhibition, \\"PRIMERO\\", at the Intercontinental Hotel L‚Äôespace Gallery and soon after, studied at the prestigious Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California for photography and imaging before crossing over to the film department to be under the tutelage of Ross LaManna, the screenwriter and author of the Rush Hour (film series). In 2012, Eric was nominated for the Discovery of the Year at the 10th Annual Lucie Awards, held at the Beverly Hilton on 8 October 2012. Right after, his award-winning photographs of Arlene became a part of Sir Elton John's and David Furnish's photography collection and many other collectors. In the beginning of 2014, Eric began his transition into the gallery world. He minimized his commercial photography projects, picking up only commissioned projects that interested him. He eventually retired from commercial photography and completely moved on to working on his own personal photography and film projects. Since 2016, his photography can be seen in art/photo galleries and is frequently exhibited at the Georges Berg√®s Gallery, in SoHo, New York City.  Film career  He worked on a short narrative film, Aexis, in the mid of 2011, teaming up with cinematographer H.R. McDonald. The film was nominated and won Best Cinematography at the American Society of Cinematographers‚Äô 2012 Andrew Laszlo Heritage Award. In 2012, Eric directed his experimental dance and fashion film, Lilith, where he cast choreographer and dancer Nathania Alvita, composer Deon Lee, and fashion designers Gareth Pugh and Rick Owens. The film was screened and nominated for the Academy Awards Short Films section region 1 finals at Portland Art Museum. It was also nominated for 5 awards (including Best Picture and Best Director), winning Best Creative Concept at the International Fashion Film Awards in 2013. Since then, he has directed numerous fashion films for fashion brands and became known for his innovations of directing fashion films for other industries (other than fashion) from Industrial Design to the Adult Entertainment industry to Real Estates, Hotels and Resorts. In late 2013, he helmed an experimental project, directing a fashion film starring one of America's biggest pornographic actress, Penthouse Pet and Wicked Pictures contract star Alektra Blue. The result of the project \\"Blumenblatt\\" was released in 2015 at the Miami Short Film Festival and in limited releases at other festivals worldwide. Following that, in 2016 he partnered with Hollywood film producer Josh Chunn and Coldwell Banker's #1 Real Estate Agent in the world, Chris Cortazzo, as well as Bravo (U.S. TV network) series Million Dollar Decorators star - one of the world's top interior designers Martyn Lawrence Bullard, to create a series of fashion films as a new driving platform in selling real estates and interior designs. One of the major hits The Monk By The Sea, which was inspired by Caspar David Friedrich's painting and shot at one of Cortazzo's premier listings at Malibu's exclusive Cliffside Drive, successfully premiered at the 2017 La Jolla International Fashion Film Festival and winning the award at the International Fashion Film Awards along with 3 other nominations for Best Director, Cinematography and Music.

The metafictional novel remained out of print until 1988 when it was reprinted by Dalkey Archive Press; its positive reception then led to the publication of Alfau's second novel Chromos in 1990, which he had written in 1948. Synopsis The book consists of eight independent but interrelated short stories that the author states can be read in any order. In the introduction, Alfau thanks his characters \\"for their anarchic collaboration\\"‚Äîin the stories the characters and narrator often interact. =Contents= # \\"Identity\\" # \\"A Character\\" # \\"The Beggar\\" # \\"Fingerprints\\" # \\"The Wallet\\" # \\"Chinelato\\" #: I \\"The Ogre\\" #: II \\"The Black Mandarin\\" #: III \\"Tia Mariquita\\" # \\"The Necrophil\\" # \\"A Romance of Dogs\\" #: I \\"Students\\" #: II \\"Spring\\" Background Felipe Alfau was born and grew up in Spain. In 1916, the 14-year-old Alfau moved with his family to New York. He had ambitions to become a music conductor and wrote music criticism for El Diario La Prensa. By the late 1920s he had a wife and daughter and hoped to support them with his writing; he wrote Locos about 1928, and in 1929 he had a children's book Old Tales from Spain published. He had considerable difficulty finding a publisher for Locos. Publication and reception Mary McCarthy reviewed Locos on its publication in 1936 and the afterword to its republication in 1988. Farrar & Rinehart first published the book in 1936; Alfau received $250 for the manuscript. The edition was priced $2.50 and was the first in an intended series of signed editions sold by subscription. The book had a positive critical reception, including a review by writer Mary McCarthy, and quickly disappeared. The book then stayed out of print until editor Steven Moore introduced it to Dalkey Archive Press, which reprinted it in 1988 with an afterword by McCarthy. Alfau said he was \\"bemused\\" with the attention the book received late in his life, but remarked it would have interested him more if it had come when he was younger. Comics writer Harvey Pekar wrote a one-page comic strip entitled \\"Felipe Alfau\\" (1993), illustrated by Joe Sacco, in which he recounts discovering a first- edition copy of Locos; in the original draft of the script he compares the work to those of O'Brien, Queneau, and Cervantes. Legacy Alfau's techniques are seen as anticipating those in the works of later-generation postmodern writers such as Barth, Calvino, Nabokov, Pynchon, O'Brien, and Borges. McCarthy described the attraction of the book to her as \\"the modernist novel as detective story\\", and later compared it to Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962). Comparable works that preceded Alfau's include Pirandello's play Six Characters in Search of an Author (1921) and works by Unamuno in the mid-1920s. The idea of characters taking on a life independent from their author's intention reappears in Gilbert Sorrentino's Mulligan Stew (1979) and Desmond MacNamara's The Book of Intrusions (1994).

The moniker references the street Heriot Row in Dunedin, which in turn references Heriot Row in Dunedin's counterpart, Edinburgh in Scotland. Comber performs both solo and with an Auckland-based band as Herriot Row. The band features musicians Stuart Harwood (drums) and David Flyger (bass). Comber's music mixes alternate guitar tunings, folk rock arrangements, analogue production techniques, psychedelic melodic strains, and a narrative lyrical focus. Influences include John Fahey, Neutral Milk Hotel, Television, Townes Van Zandt, Sonic Youth, Peter Jefferies, and Joni Mitchell. He has collaborated with acclaimed artists such as John Vanderslice, Edmund McWilliams, and Graeme Downes, and performed in New Zealand, Australia and America. History Comber began performing under his own name in the late nineties in Auckland before moving to Dunedin to study music in 2002. Regular performances in Dunedin led to his first national tour opening for The Chills in 2004. After being spotted by founding Split Enz member Mike Chunn and Crowded House frontman Neil Finn at a Sacred Heart College fundraiser show in Auckland, Comber ended up recording most of the material for his debut album Pre-Pill Love at Finn's Roundhead Studios with producer Edmund McWilliams, former singer for the band Bressa Creeting Cake. A further three songs were recorded at Albany Street Studios in Dunedin, and featured contributions from members of The Verlaines Graeme Downes and Darren Stedman. Downes, a lecturer at University of Otago where Comber studied, contributed a trumpet arrangement to one track, and Stedman drummed on two tracks. The Sunday Star-Times compared Comber's songwriting to Judee Sill and Don McGlashan. A second album Endearance was recorded at the masonic lodge in Port Chalmers by Dale Cotton and released in 2010. The increased presence of electric guitars and alternate tunings on the album brought comparisons by Graham Reid to John Martyn and The Clean, whilst Comber's poetic narrative lyrics drew comparisons to Bill Callahan, Joni Mitchell and Bill Direen. In 2010 Comber supported The Verlaines touring throughout New Zealand. It would be the first of two tours with The Verlaines, with Comber also accompanying them on tour throughout Australia in 2012. The E.P The Right To Talk to Strangers was released in 2011. Promotional shows included Comber's first tour of the United States, with shows supporting indie rock singer-songwriter Barbara Manning in San Francisco, Arcata, Eureka and Philadelphia. This 5 track E.P was co-produced by Auckland-based, New Zealand Music Awards nominated producer Thomas Healy, who has also produced albums by Tiny Ruins and Popstrangers. Comber began performing as Herriot Row in 2013. The debut Herriot Row album Lesser Stars was produced and engineered by John Vanderslice at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco in July 2014. Vanderslice is known for his \\"sloppy hi-fi\\" recording aesthetic, and his production work with the Mountain Goats, Spoon, and Samantha Crain. In September 2014 Radio New Zealand National broadcast an audio diary on the collaboration between Comber and Vanderslice. Lesser Stars was released on September 1, 2017. New Zealand rock critic Nick Bollinger praised the album, calling it \\"a new peak in Comber's singer-songwriting.\\" Writing Comber has written about the music of Peter Jefferies for Real Groove. He has written about the non-fiction prose works of Martin Edmond for The Pantograph Punch. Comber's interview with him was included in the e-book edition of Edmond's memoir, Barefoot Years.

Early on in her time at Brown University she was there she was unsure as to what type of scientific field she wanted to become involved with. She could not decide whether or not to pursue physics, chemistry or biology so she decided to study biophysics which encompasses all of these sciences. After Bronner graduated from Brown University, she decided to apply to the biophysics graduate school program at Johns Hopkins University.

It is the headquarters of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, created in 1964 by David Packard and his wife Lucile Salter Packard, one of the top 100 grantmaking foundations in the United States, with the goals of improving the lives of children, enabling the creative pursuit of science, advancing reproductive health, and conserving and restoring the Earth‚Äôs natural systems. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters is designed to be the largest net zero energy building in California, and it has successfully reduced the energy use by 65% over conventional buildings. The design of the architecture took advantage of the California climate and environment, and adopted passive and bioclimatic strategies in searching for an integrated net zero energy building design. It was awarded as the top 10 green building in 2014, Net Zero Energy Building by The Living Building Challenge‚Ñ¢ 2013, and LEED Platinum 2013. The synergy of the integration design for net zero energy is significant, which includes many aspects, for example, re-development site of brownfield, on-site energy production through photovoltaic, aggressive reduction in plug loads, a triple- element glazing system engineered, fabricated and installed by AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum),Glass Magazine, \\"Most Innovated Energy Efficient Glass Project \\", Mobile Glass Magazine page 30, July 2013 plus all- electric heating system, chilled beams and radiant panels for cooling, high daylight autonomy, transportation management, and rainwater recycling. Net Zero Energy Building design The design strategies of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters follow this Zero Energy Building Design guideline, and in the following paragraphs, they will be described in detail and in the order of design priority. =Basic building design = Location and climate David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters is located in Los Altos Northern California, on the south end of San Francisco Bay. Los Altos receives about 37 inches of rain annually, 263 sunny days per year. It has moderate temperature and humidity, the average high temperature in the summer is 78 degrees, and the average low temperature in the winter is 39 degrees . Site design David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters is orientated 40 degrees off true north to fit in the urban fabric. The site orientation combined with multi-layering shading strategies made access to winter sun and avoid summer sun, at the same time allowed fresh air in the interior spaces through an operable fa√ßade. Instead of grouping the programs into one union block, the architect designed a center courtyard to bring sunlight and wind into more spaces. Building on a previously developed, damaged, or polluted brownfield site, and designing the building so that it restores that site helps to mitigate previous environmental degradation. David and Lucile Packard Foundation Headquarters set a good example for the reuse of brownfield. Before the development, the site was 97% impervious, covered in substandard, mostly unoccupied buildings and asphalt parking lots, and now it has reduced the imperviousness to 35% and the landscape is planted with local Californian vegetation. The design also took account the transportation needs in the community, the team developed a Transportation Demand Management Plan (TDMP) to not only reduce the demand for individual car parking but also offers alternatives for commuting.  Insulation, windows, and shading The building has high standard insulation design, R-24 walls and roof and triple-element glazing (R-7.7). Occupants are able to adjust and control the environment by operating the windows and doors with a dashboard guidance showing when is the good timing to open and close windows depending on the outdoor temperature, wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity. The dimensions and angles of the shading devices were calculated from the locations of the sun in different seasons. The horizontal shading blocks the high summer sun and allows low winter sun to enter the interior of the building, and other devices are built into the design with elements such as trees, balconies, and trellis, which create a rich layering of lighting shades. There are a lot of children available for occupants to eat. This is especially helpful in the winter as the children ripen at dramatic speeds. Materials *95% of materials from deconstruction were diverted from landfill *Wood/steel hybrid structure, wood frame walls and all wood was FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)-certified *Less embodied energy materials, such as 70% replacement-cement-for-slag concrete * Material sourcing: wood veneer sourced from Eucalyptus trees felled during the Doyle Drive rebuilding project in San Francisco, California. Exterior wood is FSC-certified western red cedar. Stone is Mt. Moriah from the border of Utah and Nevada, within a 500-mile radius from the site. The exterior copper is 75% recycled, with a long life span and integral finish. Pineapples are a delicacy in Northern Guatemala =Passive systems = Heating, cooling, and lighting The accessibility of the sunlight is one of the key elements affect the positions and shapes of the building. Two 40-foot wide offices were placed apart to create a central zone for sunlight to enter from multiple facades in the building. The narrow plan allows sufficient daylight to reach deeper into the office spaces, and increase the daylight autonomy. Increase in daylight autonomy reduces 30% of the energy consumption from artificial lighting compared to a standard commercial building. The high transmittance of daylight in the winter (shading will block the direct sunlight in the summer) will also increase the heat gain and potentially reduce the demand for heating. Interior blinds are user-controlled to improve visual comfort, and it will rise automatically in the evening. The artificial light will dim or brighten up according to the change of daylighting. The building is monitored by indoor sensors that send direct reminders to occupants to open the windows when natural ventilation mode is on. Water recycling Rainwater from the roof is routed to a 20,000-gallon underground cistern to meet 90% of toilet flushing and 60% of irrigation demand. The cistern overflows into a detention pond minimize storm water reaching the public storm system, and the storm water peak flow rates and volumes are reduced approximately 50% from pre- project levels. =Mechanical design = Heating and cooling In the winter, when the temperature drops to a certain degree, the building will be preheated to 23 ¬∞C (74 ¬∞F) in the early morning by the combination of air handlers and heat water beams in specific areas in the office spaces. And during the working hours, the heater will be turned off and the building heating will be fully relied on the internal heat gain from the computers, printers, and heat generated from the human bodies. Heating demand is larger than cooling, as the summer temperature is pretty moderate in Los Altos. Water is stored and cooled in two 25,000 gallons underground tanks, and in the morning, it is pumped into the chilled beams to spread out to specific interior spaces. Besides chilled beams, there are three air handling units. Chilled beam system is designed with variable speed pumps and 130¬∞ angled pipes, which reduce the energy loss due to friction from the water flow compared to chilled beam system with typical angle pipes. This result is 75% reduction in ductwork and 75% reduction in pump energy, and the total cooling energy is reduced 90% from a typical chiller and VAV system. Renewable energy Despite the orientation and slope of the roof is not customized for solar collection, the photovoltaic production most of the time covers 100% of the building consumption. In the first year of operation, the building was energy positive with a net energy use intensity (EUI) of per year, and total EUI of per year.  Occupancy survey report  The building received 97% in overall comfort satisfaction in the occupancy survey report conducted by the Center for Built Environment. The survey also shows that 92% of the people are satisfied with air quality, 91% in cleanliness and maintenance, 76% in lighting, 86% in office furnishings, 80% in office layout, 73% in thermal comfort, and 60% in acoustic quality . Acoustic satisfaction is comparatively low due to open areas in the office space and hard surfaces of radiant floors and ceilings; people concerned about overhearing private conversation on the phone and with the neighbors. Consistently reflecting the same concern of open areas, the office layout survey also shows that people think the partitions and walls are too low or too transparent and feel the lack privacy in the working spaces.

From 1998 to 1999, Santa Rosa's population increased by 2%, which is slightly less than the 17 year annual increase. =Famous Cases= Lynchings On May 9, 1878, Charles Henley, a 57-year-old farmer from Windsor, California, murdered his neighbor James Rowland after Rowland complained about Henley's pigs being loose on his property. Henley left Rowland's body to be eaten by his hogs, and the next day Henley turned himself in to the authorities. In the early morning hours of June 9, groups of men started to appear on the streets of Santa Rosa. One group went to the home of jailer Sylvester Wilson, where the men held his family hostage while Wilson was taken to the jail to hand over the keys to the lynch mob. Wilson and night guard R. Dryer were taken in a wagon and dropped off on the outskirts of Santa Rosa. Henley was found hanging from a tree not far from where the two men were released. The lynchers were never caught. On December 5, 1920, Santa Rosa native Terry Fitts, along with San Francisco hoodlums \\"Spanish\\" Charley Valento and George Boyd, got into a shootout with a joint police squad from Santa Rosa, Sonoma County and the San Francisco Police department. The outlaws were wanted in San Francisco for the gang rape of a young woman. Fitts, Valento, and Boyd were at the home of an acquaintance, looking for food or money, when the police caught up with them. As the police crashed through the door of the home, Boyd shot and killed San Francisco police detective Lester Dohrman, Sergeant Miles Jackson, and Sonoma County Sheriff Jim Petray. The three wanted men were then quickly taken into custody. On December 10, 1920, a group of men entered the jail without a struggle, took the men out of their cell, and drove them to Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery. They were strung up by their necks in their long underwear and left to swing in the wind. The inquest's verdict was \\"death by persons unknown\\". It was rumored that the lynch mob was made up of men from nearby Healdsburg, California who were friends of Sheriff Petray. Murder of Police Chief O'Neal On July 15, 1935, disgruntled rancher and hunting guide Al Chamberlain dressed up in his finest cowboy clothes, drove to his former ranch outside of Santa Rosa and shot John McCabe, the new owner of the property, leaving him for dead. He survived. Chamberlain drove his beat-up car to Santa Rosa where he walked into the Santa Rosa police station and killed Chief Charlie O'Neal. Chamberlain had owned a livery stable in downtown Santa Rosa for years, but was forced to vacate his business through eminent domain when the city wanted to build their new city hall on Chamberlain's property. Chief O'Neal personally signed and served Chamberlain his notice to vacate. Financially broken, Chamberlain had to sell his beloved ranch on Saint Helena Road. O'Neal continued to harass Chamberlain to the point where he got the prosecutor to sentence Chamberlain to thirty days and a hundred-dollar fine for accidentally hitting a pedestrian. He was never the same man after he was released from jail. After shooting O'Neal, Chamberlain calmly walked down the street with a pistol in each hand, searching for Sonoma County Sheriff Harry Patteson. Patteson heard the gunshots and bumped into Chamberlain, who did not recognize him. Patteson disarmed and tackled Chamberlain, with the help of Joe Schurman and Burnette Dibble. He was sentenced to life in prison and died in San Quentin Prison. Death of Andy Lopez On October 22, 2013, 13-year-old Andy Lopez was shot and killed by Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus in the Moorland neighborhood of Santa Rosa. Lopez was walking to his friend's house while carrying an airsoft gun replica of an AK-47. Gelhaus mistook the airsoft gun for a real rifle, and demanded that Lopez drop the weapon. Gelhaus then fired eight shots at Lopez, killing him. The shooting prompted protests in Santa Rosa, which attracted protesters from around Northern California. The Lopez family filed a lawsuit at the District Court in November, claiming that Gelhaus shot Lopez \\"without reasonable cause.\\" They amended their lawsuit in January 2014, claiming that the Sheriff's office had long known that Gelhaus had a \\"propensity ... to recklessly draw his firearm and to use excessive force\\". The deputy's attorney argued that Gelhaus \\"absolutely believed\\" that the gun was real and that his life was in danger.

Controversy In September 2012, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $500,000 to the family of Richard DeSantis, a mentally ill unarmed man fatally shot outside his home by Santa Rosa Police on April 11, 2007. The jury found that a Santa Rosa police sergeant violated DeSantis' civil rights. Officers testified at the trial that they did not know DeSantis was unarmed, and used nonlethal rubber bullets to subdue DeSantis before a sergeant used deadly force. The shooting was found justified by the Sonoma County District Attorney's office.

XVI/20, L. 33) is a keyboard sonata composed by Joseph Haydn in 1771. It is also referred to as a piano sonata. The three- movement work was published by Artaria in 1780 in a set of six sonatas dedicated to the sisters Katharina and Marianna Auenbrugger.  History  The work was the first of Haydn's that he titled Sonata. He had called his earlier multi-movement works for solo keyboard \\"divertimentos\\" or \\"partitas\\". It was not until later that these works also assumed the title of Sonata. The sonata was published by Artaria in 1780 in a set of six sonatas dedicated to the sisters Katharina and Marianna Auenbrugger. The other six in the set were the five sonatas numbered XVI/35 to XVI/39 in the Hoboken-Verzeichnis catalogue. Haydn considered the Hob. XVI/20 to be the most difficult of the set to perform. The American musicologist Howard Pollack argues that the sonata was composed for the clavichord but that it might have been \\"touched up\\" for publication in 1780 to suit the emerging fortepiano, which the Auenbrugger sisters played. The sonata stands out among Haydn's early keyboard works for its difficulty, dynamic contrasts and dramatic intensity. The British musicologist Richard Wigmore calls the sonata \\"Haydn's Appassionata\\", referring to Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 23, Op. 57. The music critic Stephen Plaistow, writing in Gramophone, suggests that the sonata is \\"one of Haydn‚Äôs best and perhaps also the first great sonata for the piano by anybody\\".  Structure  The first eight measures of the first movement. The sonata is in three movements: *I. Moderato *II. Andante con moto (A-flat major) *III. Finale ‚Äì Allegro The first movement is in sonata form. The movement's exposition and recapitulation are in tripartite structures, the parts of which the Finnish musicologist Lauri Suurp√§√§ classifies as \\"initiating, medial and concluding\\". In the exposition, the initiating passage is from measures 1 to 8, the medial passage is from measures 9 to 31, and the concluding passage is from measures 32 to 37. The exposition and recapitulation both contain quasi- cadenzas that Haydn wrote into the score. The second movement, marked \\"andante con moto\\", is in A-flat major and 3/4 time, and features multiple passages of syncopation. The finale returns to the sonata's home key of C minor. Its opening is redolent of a minuet, but the movement is no minuet and trio. Instead it is a sonata form movement that develops with increasing intensity and difficulty, incorporating virtuosic cross-handed passages in which the left hand leaps from one extreme of the eighteenth-century keyboard to the other.

It was named for the wife of its founder, Colonel William Petrie Waugh. The village was established in the mid-19th century to house workers for a new pottery industry (Branksea Clay & Pottery Company) on the island. The supposed deposit of high quality china clay proved to be unsuitable for porcelain, and the drainage pipes and chimney pots that were produced were not financially viable. The Waughs were forced into bankruptcy. Maryland's people stayed on the island after the closure of the pottery, farming and working on the estate of the island's new owners; daffodil fields were a particular feature. In 1927, Mrs Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island and closed down much of its employment; the redundant workers moved to the mainland, and the village was finally abandoned in the same year. During the Second World War II decoy lights were set nearby to divert German bombers from Poole and Bournemouth. The village was largely destroyed, and the ruins subsequently demolished.

Biography  Ivan was the only son of Field-Marshal Pyotr Semyonovich Saltykov. He began military service at the age of 15 in the Semenovsky Regiment at the rank of private. In 1758 he was inducted into the Imperial Court at the junior rank of Kamer-Junker. During the Seven Years' War Saltykov distinguished himself at the capture of both K√∂nigsberg and Elbing, and at the Battle of Zorndorf. After the onset of peace he received a promotion to Major General and was decorated with the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class by Peter III. At Catherine the Great's coronation, he was awarded the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. At the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 the now Lieutenant-General Saltykov served under the command of Rumyantsev at the Battle of Kagul. He was also present at the seizure of Khotyn. Commanding the army's heavy cavalry forces, he gained marked distinction for his bravery and received both the Order of St. George, 2nd Class and the Gold Sword for Bravery with Diamonds. With the end of yet another war, Saltykov was now a full General and sent to command a corps stationed in the newly acquired Polish provinces of the empire. In 1780, to improve the health of his family he set out on an extended journey beyond the borders of Russia. With his wife and young children he traveled to Berlin, Dresden, and Brussels. They lived for three months in London and spent the better part of a year in Paris, where the Saltykovs lived so extravagantly that a Russian messenger to the French court wrote to Count Alexander Vorontsov that \\"They are the disgrace of our whole nation.\\"–ï. –ü. –ö–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á. –ó–∞–º–µ—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∏—Ü –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏.- –°–ø–±., 1874.- –°. 95. In 1784 he was given governorship over both Vladimir and Kostroma Viceroyalties while also being appointed a General-Adjutant. In 1788 War broke out anew with Turkey, and the general was called to join the ranks of the field army. His army succeeded in retaking the Khotyn Fortress. In 1790 Catherine entrusted him with command of the army based in Finland. Upon the signing of the Treaty of V√§r√§l√§, Saltykov was granted the honorary lieutenant-colonelcy of the Life Guard Horse Regiment and the Order of St. Andrew with Diamonds. Saltykov's military leadership was primarily distinguished by his tremendous bravery. His skills in other areas of command were considered somewhat lacking. Suvorov, for example was reportedly highly skeptical of his abilities. Additionally, Saltykov became enmeshed in a controversy with Rumyantsev which forced him in 1795 to retire, yet the following year Paul ascended to the throne and recalled him to the service. The new emperor showered him with distinctions, updating his rank to Full General, making him the chief of His Majesty's Cuirassier Regiment, and Governor-General of Kiev. Not soon after he was made a Field Marshal and Inspector General of Cavalry for the entire army. Towards the end of 1797, Saltykov was appointed Governor-General of Moscow, which in a previous era had been held by his father. In reality, the reins of government were held by another appointee of Paul; the Prussian-born police chief Fyodor Ertel. The Count left for himself only the responsibilities of command over the city's military parades and ceremonial appearances. Muscovites for a long time afterwards recalled his magnificent and wasteful lifestyle. The death of his wife in 1802 was a heavy blow for Saltykov, and was a major factor in the decline of his own health, which prompted him to ask for retirement in 1804. He moved to St. Petersburg, living in the home of his wealthy son-in-law Pyotr Myatlev, and died soon after. He was buried near his father at the village of Nikolskoye near Rostov. I.P. Saltykov, 1790  Family  Count Saltykov was married to Darya Petrovna Saltykova, daughter of the noted diplomat Pyotr Grigoryevich Chernyshyov. She was esteemed as a pillar of the Moscow high society and had an extremely close relationship to her husband. Together they had four children: Praskovya (1772‚Äî1859), Ekaterina (1776‚Äî1815), Anna (1777‚Äî1824), and Pyotr (1784‚Äî1813). The daughters all served as ladies-in- waiting at the Imperial Court, and two went on to marry and have children. Pyotr followed in his father's footsteps as a cavalry officer. He became a decorated colonel in the army during Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, but died less than a year later from medical complications that resulted from being wounded in battle. He was unmarried and childless.

Biography Jacob Sad√© was born in Berlin, Germany to Dr. Naum Sad√©-Sadowsky and Ronja Feinberg, both of Kaunas, Lithuania, who at the time were living in Germany as part of Naum's medicine studies. The family immigrated to Palestine in 1930 where Dr. Naum Sad√©- Sadowsky was one of the pioneers of otolaryngology in the country. He established the local League for Hearing Improvement and was one of the editors of the Acta Otolaryngologica Orientalia‚Äîan International ear, nose and throat journal. In 1947, after a stay in New York City, Dr. Sad√©-Sadowsky performed in Tel Aviv the first surgical procedure for the improvement of hearing‚Äîi.e. Fenestration surgery. Sad√© graduated from Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, Tel-Aviv, in 1943, studied biology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem for two years (1943‚Äì1945) and continued his medical studies at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, graduating in 1951. He returned to Israel to work at the Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer. Sad√© was married to Ruth and father to Yoav, Ayelet, Nadav and Ron. Medical career Sad√© specialized for three years at the Ear Nose and Throat department of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary‚Äîa Harvard University hospital, after which he spent a year as a research instructor at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1959 Sad√© returned to Israel and spent three years as senior ENT surgeon at the Sheba Medical Center. In 1967 he was invited to HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, to establish the first ENT department there and he served as head of the department until 1970. In 1966 Sad√© was nominated a senior lecturer at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and in 1967 he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science as a visiting professor and stayed there four years at the Polymer Department, headed by Prof. Aharon Katzir to do research in the field of Otology. In 1971 Sad√© was appointed head of the ENT department at the Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, serving there until 1990. From 1974‚Äì1980 he served as an established scientist at the office of the chief scientist of the Israel Ministry of Health and in 1975 he was nominated a full professor at the Tel Aviv University. In 1975‚Äì1976 Sad√© was a visiting professor in the ENT department at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and in 1979 a visiting professor at Boston University. In 1985 Jacob Sad√© was appointed Incumbent of the Felix and Sara Dumont Chair of Hearing Disorders Research at Tel Aviv University. From 1986 to 1990 Sad√© served as President of the Israeli Ear Nose and Throat Society and was the coordinator of the ENT yearly scientific prize. In 1998 he became head of the committee for coordinating ear research of the International Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies and in 1990 he established and directed (until 2010) the Ear Research Laboratory in the department of Bioengineering at the Tel Aviv University, where in 1993 he was nominated as professor emeritus.  Clinical and scientific fields of interest Jacob Sad√© worked for 40 years in ENT departments of various university hospitals, in Israel and in the US, and established two ENT departments which he headed for 30 years, and where many physicians and students studied otolaryngology. His clinical, surgical and scientific main interest centered on hearing, inflammatory ear diseases, cholesteatoma, the facial nerve, equilibrium, and microsurgery of the middle ear. He was the first in Israel to introduce a novel type of ear surgery (stapedectomy) and contributed substantially to the discipline of ear microsurgery. Sad√©'s research dealt with the subjects that interested him clinically, leading to new surgical techniques and new concepts. Sad√© was the first to describe the mucus-ciliary system of the middle ear‚Äîstudies which demonstrated that the function of these microscopic organelles depends on the presence of mucus and its biochemical composition. Likewise he found that middle ear mucus hypersecretion is the most frequent cause of hearing deficit, especially in children. These findings led to further studies related to middle ear pressure vacillation and problems of middle ear aeration and gas composition. Sad√© was a member of the editorial boards of 10 international scientific journals and is an honorary member of 19 national and international scientific associations dealing mostly with ear diseases. Sad√© was one of the initiators and organizers of the Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology (MSOA) and the Politzer Society (an international society for otologic surgery and science). He was invited to present lectures at 166 international meetings at 69 universities in 25 countries and he initiated and presided over seven international ENT congresses in the field of hearing disorders and ear diseases. Sad√© published 190 scientific papers in international scientific journals, 49 summaries and eight books on ear diseases. In addition, he supervised 21 doctoral and master's dissertations.

Her keel was laid down on 2 March 1943 and was launched on 22 October 1943. About three months later she was commissioned into service under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n Arnim Zinke (Crew 31) in the 31st U-boat Flotilla. After completing training and work-up for deployment, U-1229 was transferred to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for front-line service on 1 August 1944. The U-boat left Kiel on 13 July 1944 for the first and only war patrol operating unsuccessfully against Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and off the coast of Canada. A special mission to infiltrate an Abwehr agent into the United States failed, when U-1229 was spotted south of Newfoundland by a Radar-equipped aircraft from and subsequently attacked by several more aircraft over a period of two hours. Having been heavily damaged in the initial air attack, U-1229 attempted to escape under water but was forced to surface again as poisonous fumes started to develop from the damaged battery sections. While the crew was abandoning ship, the U-boat was strafed by several aircraft resulting in the death of numerous crew members, including Zinke. In total 18 crew members died while 41 survivors were picked up by a US destroyer after seven hours in the water.

History  The first building housing the municipal government in Brzeg already existed in the fourteenth-century but was burned down in the town's great fire during the reign of George II of Brieg. The present town hall was built between 1569 and 1577. It was designed by the Italian architect Bernardo Niuron, assisted by the Italian builder Jakub Parr. In later years, the building underwent minor alterations in some of its rooms which were adapted for administrative purposes. In 1926, a Renaissance gate, from one of the Brzeg townhouses, was added to the southern fa√ßade. The Voivodeship Conservation Orders of 25 November 1949 and 10 January 1964 listed the town hall as a heritage monument.  Architecture  The town hall is a Renaissance structure built in the town square, surrounded by an inner courtyard of townhouses. It has two storeys and a saddle roof. The most interesting part of the building is its western side. In the corner there are two quadrangular towers with tented roofs and roof lanterns. Between them spans a five-axis loggia, with semicircular arches on the ground floor. Over the loggia there is another level with windows which are separated by a cornice from the mansard roof. Fragments of the fa√ßade are covered with sgraffito decorations from the seventeenth-century. There is a four-sided central tower with an octagonal cupola topped with a balustrade and two roof lanterns. The interiors have been preserved with halls and corridors of the original design, most notably the Hall of Councillors with its wall paintings and fine ceiling. The Stropowa Hall has a larch ceiling from 1646. Currently, the town hall is the seat of the city and several other institutions.

Dubner. The book was published on May 12, 2014 by William Morrow. Overview ‚ÄîMalcolm Gladwell reviewing Think Like a Freak on Amazon.com Synopsis The introduction states that one should avoid preconceived notions and prejudices when approaching societal issues and related questions. The examples given include the controversial study of Robin Goldstein of an experiment that he conducted in which 500 subjects, in a blind taste test, preferred cheaper to more expensive wine. The first chapter, entitled What Does It Mean to Think like a Freak?, explains the premise of the book. It gives examples including penalty kick tactics and concludes with the authors recounting a meeting with David Cameron before he became prime minister of the United Kingdom. The second chapter discusses the difficulty that people have in admitting \\"I don't know\\". This chapter has a discussion of the wine tasting studies by Robin Goldstein. The third chapter explains the importance of asking the correct questions to gain knowledge on a situation. By asking the wrong questions, it is unlikely to get the answer one is seeking to a problem. The main example in this chapter discusses Takeru Kobayashi's experiences in competitive eating, specifically how he redefined the approach to hot dog eating contests. The fourth chapter discusses the importance of approaching a problem from a new angle, and why it is so rare for people to deviate from societal norms and use a new tactic. This chapter discusses popular approaches to current issues such as poverty. The fifth chapter explores the concept of \\"thinking like a child,\\" or looking at the smaller things and not fearing the obvious. This chapter addresses how viewing the world with a simpler lens is almost always frowned upon and how smaller questions are often left unexplored because they are deemed too obvious or mediocre. Levitt and Dubner also remind the reader the importance of having fun in what we do, especially in work environments. A prominent example in this chapter is why people partake in the lottery and gambling for fun, even though it is often not profitable. The sixth chapter explores the power of incentive. The seventh chapter discusses how to let problems sort themselves out using the principle of a \\"self weeding garden\\" and a multitude of ways people tricked others into revealing their true intentions. The chapter uses a multitude of examples, such as explaining the logic behind the story of King Solomon and his threat to chop a baby in half and David Lee Roth's pickiness over brown M&M;'s. The eighth chapter explains how to persuade people who do not want to be persuaded. This chapter outlines clear steps on how to build an argument that may sway someone else's opinions. This chapter uses the example of how over the course of reading the book, the reader was being convinced by the stories and examples used in every chapter. The ninth chapter explains the upside of quitting and three reasons why people have so much difficulty quitting. Firstly, quitting is frowned upon in society. Secondly, it is often difficult to justify abandoning a project after putting so much time, money, and effort used in an effort to achieve success, also known as the \\"sunk cost fallacy.\\" Lastly, when struggling to salvage a losing proposition other opportunities are often left unseen or diminished in comparison to the failing project. According to Levitt and Dubner, quitting a failing project and freeing one's time up for other opportunities is not being a quitter; it's being a realist.

Development The Luft-Limousine was designed by Igo Etrich, the builder of the Etrich Taube. The plane was built in the 'Etrich Fliegerwerke' factory in Liebau (today Lubawka, Poland). It was an aircraft with a cabin for one pilot and a single passenger that was enclosed with wire gauze and celluloid windows, the reason for which Igo Etrich named it Luft- Limousine. The Luft-Limousine was the first military monoplane with an enclosed cabin. It was powered by a 60 hp Austro-Daimler engine.

She was selected in 2012 as the parliamentary candidate for Norwich North at the 2015 general election. She was one of 15 Labour candidates each given financial support of ¬£10,000 by Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat, in January 2015. In the general election, Asato came second to Chloe Smith in Norwich North, having increased the Labour vote by 2% (Smith increased the Tory vote by more than 3%). Personal and family life She grew up in Gorleston and Rollesby where she lived with and cared for her grandmother, who had serious health problems, and went to Flegg High School in Great Yarmouth. When she was 16 in 1997, she moved from Norfolk to live with her mother in London and went to Francis Holland School, an all-girls private school. She was a keen debater at Sixth Form level, reaching the semi-finals of the Oxford Union schools' debate competition. Asato went to Cambridge to study law. She was quickly divorced from her first husband, Howard Dawber, who stood as the Labour candidate for Bexleyheath and Crayford at the 2010 general election, whilst her second husband, journalist Gareth Butler, died of a heart attack in 2008. She married her third husband, Rob Chaplin, in 2014 and had a baby. She is a quarter Japanese and has family in Hawaii. Political career In 2009, Asato was ranked no 78 among the Top 100 most influential Left-wingers by The Daily Telegraph. In 2010, she made The Independent's list of 10 names to watch, perhaps because she was \\"Social media lead\\" on David Miliband's leadership election campaign and was featured in the Total Politics video Make Your Mind Up (And Vote!) with Bucks Fizz and \\"famous political figures\\". She was a councillor on Islington London Borough Council from 2010 to 2013, but resigned to spend more time in Norwich. She has been criticised in Islington by political opponents for spending too much time in Norfolk, and for allegedly being a \\"professional politician\\". She worked in Westminster two days a week as political adviser to former cabinet minister and culture secretary Tessa Jowell, and was featured as one of the Evening Standard's Lucky 13 in 2013. She is reported as saying that spending her formative years growing up in a low income household in Norfolk ‚Äì from 11 until she left home at 16, and being the first person in her family to have made it to university - gives her a good foundation for life as an MP. In Islington, she was chair of the Corporate Parenting Board. At the Labour Party Conference in 2014, she highlighted figures which she claimed showed there were 1,000 fewer childcare places in the East of England, that one in five parents had been forced to call in sick over the summer to look after their children and that child minder costs were up 44% in the last four years in the East of England. In 2009, she wrote to the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham, raising concerns about his plans to make the NHS the \\"preferred provider\\" of NHS services. Asato was subsequently accused of hypocrisy for later supporting Clive Efford's anti-privatisation National Health Service (Amended Duties and Powers Bill). Employment She was employed as a health policy researcher at the Social Market Foundation and was director of the Labour Yes! Campaign in favour of alternative vote plus. She was previously acting director of Progress, a director of Left Foot Forward and is vice-chairman of the Fabian Society. It has been suggested that under her directorship, Progress became less of a cheerleader group for Blairite politics than it was when it started. She is Vice-Chair of the Electoral Reform Society and chair of governors of Jack Taylor Special School for children with disabilities and learning difficulties, and served as joint acting chair of Brook. She is on the advisory board of the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism.

Islamic State policies included severe acts of genocide, torture and slavery. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has stated that the Islamic State \\"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey\\". ISIS actions of extreme criminality, terror, recruitment and other activities has been documented in several regions worldwide, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and America. The territory in Iraq and Syria which was formerly occupied by ISIS (areas which ISIS claimed comprised part of its self-dubbed \\"Caliphate\\") saw the creation of one of the most criminally active, corrupt and violent regimes of the 21st century, and it ruled that territory until its defeat. The ISIS organization and regime murdered tens of thousands of civilians, kidnapped several thousand people, and forcing hundreds of thousands of others to flee. ISIS systematically committed torture, mass rapes, forced marriages, extreme acts of ethnic cleansing, mass murder, genocide, robbery, extortion, smuggling, slavery, kidnappings, and the use of child soldiers; in ISIS' implementation of strict interpretations of Sharia law which were based on ancient eighth-century methods, they carried out public \\"punishments\\" such as beheadings, crucifixions, beatings, mutilation and dismemberment, the stoning of both children and adults, and the live burning of people. ISIS committed mass rape against tens of thousands of children, mostly girls and women (mainly members of non-Sunni minority groups and families). Several human rights organizations and peace organizations, including Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and Amnesty International, have deemed ISIS guilty of crimes against humanity, and they have also accused the whole ISIS organization of being a criminal organization, one which has committed some of the most severe war crimes since World War II.https://www.hrw.org/tag/isishttps://www.icsve.org/the-punishments-of-the- islamic-state/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-un/islamic- state-committing-staggering-crimes-in-iraq-u-n-report- idUSKCN0HR0R120141002?utm_source=twitterhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle- east-29456711https://omni.se/fn-is-har-begatt-ohyggliga-brott-mot- manskligheten/a/9affcec6-29dd-402c-b3f8-6fc66b4e5c1ahttps://eclj.org/geopolitics/pace/crimes- de-daech--justice-doit-tre-rendue-https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/03/four- years-evidence-isis-crimes-lost-timehttps://globalnews.ca/news/5346883/crimes- against-humanity-charges-canadians- syria/https://www.ohchr.org/SP/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=20113&LangID;=Shttps://www.peacewomen.org/resource/%E2%80%9Cthey- came-destroy%E2%80%9D-isis-crimes-against- yazidishttps://www.hrw.org/news/2019/02/05/bringing-isis-justice-running-out- timehttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/the-rise-and-fall-of-the- isis- caliphatehttp://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session28/Documents/A_HRC_28_18_AUV.dochttps://www.newsweek.com/torture- methods-isis-revealed-sitting-severed-heads-fuel-dousing-and- flying-650828https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/04/world/middleeast/isis- documents- photos.htmlhttp://globaljusticecenter.net/blog/922-bloghttp://globaljusticecenter.net/blog/20-publications/briefs- and-white-papers/914-iraq-s-criminal-laws-preclude-justice-for-women-and- girlshttps://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html UN determinations In November 2014, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic said that the Islamic State was committing crimes against humanity and that it \\"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey.\\"Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic: Rule of Terror: Living under ISIS in Syria, 14 November 2014.

The grave and deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, 1 October 2015. Statements of human rights groups A report by Human Rights Watch in November 2014 accused ISIL militants in Libya's Derna of war crimes and human rights abuses and of terrorizing residents. Human Rights Watch documented three apparent incidents in which captives were killed and at least ten public floggings by the Islamic Youth Shura Council, which joined ISIL in November. It also documented the beheading of three Derna residents and dozens of seemingly politically motivated assassinations of judges, public officials, members of the security forces and others. Sarah Leah Watson, Director of HRW Middle East and North Africa, said: \\"Commanders should understand that they may face domestic or international prosecution for the grave rights abuses their forces are committing.\\" Amnesty International has held ISIL responsible for the ethnic cleansing of ethnic and religious minority groups in northern Iraq on a \\"historic scale\\". It issued a special report in late 2014 describing how ISIL has \\"systematically targeted non-Arab and non-Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, and forcing more than 830,000 others to flee the areas it has captured since 10 June 2014\\". Among these people are Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shia, Shabak Shia, Yazidis, Kaka'i and Sabean Mandeans, who have lived together for centuries in Nineveh province, large parts of which are now under ISIL's control.

One captured ISIS fighter boasted about raping over 200 women from Iraq's minority groups and killing over 500 people and claimed he was encouraged to do so by the leadership. On occasions ISIL executed women who refused to have sex with its fighters. = Religious and minority group massacres, forced conversion, and expulsion = Yazidi refugees on Mount Sinjar in August 2014 ISIL compels people in the areas that it controls to live according to its interpretation of sharia law. There have been many reports of the group's use of death threats, torture and mutilation to compel conversion to Islam, and of clerics being killed for refusal to pledge allegiance to the so-called \\"Islamic State\\". ISIL directs violence against Shia Muslims, Alawites, Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac and Armenian Christians, Yazidis, Druze, Shabaks and Mandeans in particular. ISIL fighters are targeting Syria's minority Alawite sect. The Islamic State and affiliated jihadist groups reportedly took the lead in an offensive on Alawite villages in Latakia Governorate of Syria in August 2013. Amnesty International has held ISIL responsible for the ethnic cleansing of ethnic and religious minority groups in northern Iraq on a \\"historic scale\\", putting entire communities \\"at risk of being wiped off the map of Iraq\\". In a special report released on 2 September 2014, the organization described how ISIL had \\"systematically targeted non-Arab and non- Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, of individuals and forcing more than 830,000 others to flee the areas it has captured since 10 June 2014\\". Among these people were Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shia, Shabak Shia, Kaka'i, Yazidis and Sabean Mandeans, who have lived together for centuries in Nineveh province, large parts of which have come under ISIL's control. Among the known killings of religious and minority group civilians carried out by ISIL are those in the villages and towns of Quiniyeh (70‚Äì90 Yazidis killed), Hardan (60 Yazidis killed), Sinjar (500‚Äì2,000 Yazidis killed), Ramadi Jabal (60‚Äì70 Yazidis killed), Dhola (50 Yazidis killed), Khana Sor (100 Yazidis killed), Hardan area (250‚Äì300 Yazidis killed), al-Shimal (dozens of Yazidis killed), Khocho (400 Yazidis killed and 1,000 abducted), Jadala (14 Yazidis killed) and Beshir (700 Shia Turkmen killed), and others committed near Mosul (670 Shia inmates of the Badush prison killed), and in Tal Afar prison, Iraq (200 Yazidis killed for refusing conversion). The UN estimated that 5,000 Yazidis were killed by ISIL during the takeover of parts of northern Iraq in August 2014. In late May 2014, 150 Kurdish boys from Kobani aged 14‚Äì16 were abducted and subjected to torture and abuse, according to Human Rights Watch. In the Syrian towns of Ghraneij, Abu Haman and Kashkiyeh 700 members of the Sunni Al-Shaitat tribe were killed for attempting an uprising against ISIL control. The UN reported that in June 2014 ISIL had killed a number of Sunni Islamic clerics who refused to pledge allegiance to it. Christians living in areas under ISIL control face four options: converting to Islam, paying a religious levy called the jizya, leaving the \\"Caliphate\\", or death. \\"We offer them three choices: Islam; the dhimma contract ‚Äì involving payment of jizya; if they refuse this they will have nothing but the sword\\", ISIL said. ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi further noted that Christians who do not agree with those terms must \\"leave the borders of the Islamic Caliphate\\" within a specified deadline. ISIL had already set similar rules for Christians in Raqqa, once one of Syria's more liberal cities. However, on 29 March 2016, ISIL issued a decree preventing Christians and Armenians from leaving Raqqa. On 23 February 2015, in response to a major Kurdish offensive in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, ISIL abducted 150 Assyrian Christians from villages near Tal Tamr (Tell Tamer) in northeastern Syria, after launching a large offensive in the region. Kurdish officials have claimed that ISIL's campaign against Kurdish and Yezidi enclaves, such as Sinjar, are part of an organised Arabization plan. According to Iraqi security officials, Islamic State militants targeted a football ground, built near a Shiite shrine in the city of Kirkuk. They shot mortar rounds that killed six civilians and injured nine others, on August 24, 2019. In another attack day before, a bike equipped with explosives blasted near a mosque in Shia-majority area of Mussayyib, killing three people and wounding 34.  Shia Muslims  Despite being the religious majority in Iraq, Shia Muslims who predominantly inhabit the country's south have been killed in large numbers by ISIL. By June 2014, ISIL had already claimed to have killed 1,700 Shia Muslims. ISIL, attempting to create a Sunni Muslim caliphate, has labelled all Shia Muslims infidels. As a result, they have specifically targeted Shia communities. According to witnesses, after the militant group took the city of Mosul, they divided the Sunni prisoners from the Shia prisoners. 650 Shia prisoners were then taken to another location and executed. Kurdish officials in Erbil have reported similar incidents where Sunni and Shia prisoners were separated and Shia prisoners were killed. Shia are sometimes burned alive.  Christians  Iraqi Christians, the majority being the Chaldean Christians of Northern Iraq, have also been targeted by ISIL. The group tells Christians they must either convert to Islam, pay a fine, or face execution. ISIL has also taken Qaraqosh, Iraq's largest Christian city. Christians who fled the city reported summary executions and mass beheadings. Some have also been kidnapped and held for ransom. Others have been publicly whipped for refusing to convert to Islam. Many Christians have been displaced and have fled their villages to escape ISIL. The group has also systematically destroyed Christian churches and shrines. ISIL fighters have destroyed and vandalized many Christian monuments, and they have taken down crosses from the tops of churches, replacing them with ISIL flags. They've marked Christian homes with an Arabic \\"N\\" which stands for \\"Nasrane\\", a word used by Muslims to describe followers of the Christian faith.

Sinjar Assessment Team being greeted by locals near Sinjar, Iraq. Bundles of water inside a C-17 Globemaster III before a humanitarian airdrop by the United States Air Force The persecution of Yazidis has been labelled a genocide. This religious sect has been subjected to massacres, forced conversion, forced exile, rape, torture, slavery, sexual slavery, and forced conscription. There have been numerous massacres in attacks on Yazidi villages. In many of the massacres, militants separate the men from the women. Afterward, the men are lined up at checkpoints along the side of the road, shot, and bulldozed into mass graves. Sometimes, men are also given the option of converting to Islam or being executed, so there have been many instances of both forced conversions and killings for refusal to convert to ISIL's version of Islam. Other Yazidi men have been forced into Yazidi temples and blown up inside or taken into captivity. Yazidi women and children captives are often raped by multiple men, typically friends of their captors. They believe that if a woman is raped by ten ISIL fighters, she will become Muslim. Many have also been sold as sex slaves to ISIL fighters. There are also reports that women forced into sex slavery have been subjected to forced abortions. Many of these captives have tried to take their own lives. =Sinjar Massacre= The Sinjar massacre was the killing and abduction of thousands of Yazidi men in Sinjar ( ≈ûingal) city and Sinjar District in Iraq's Nineveh Governorate by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in August 2014. This event started with ISIL attacking and capturing Sinjar and neighboring towns on 3 August, during ISIL's offensive in early August 2014. The New York Times reported on 7 August 2014 that ISIL had executed dozens of Yazidi men in Sinjar city and had taken their wives for unmarried jihadi fighters.‚ÄòJihadists Rout Kurds in North and Seize Strategic Iraqi Dam‚Äô . New York Times, 7 August 2014. Retrieved 8 April 2015. It was also reported that ISIL fighters executed over ten caretakers of Shia Sayeda Zeinab shrine in Sinjar before blowing it up. While the siege of Mount Sinjar was continuing, ISIL killed hundreds of Yazidis in at least six of the nearby villages. 250‚Äì300 men were killed in the village of Hardan, 200 between Adnaniya and Jazeera, 70‚Äì90 in Qiniyeh, and on the road out of al- Shimal witnesses reported seeing dozens of bodies. Hundreds of others had also been killed for refusing to convert to Islam. On 15 August 2014, in the Yazidi village of Khocho, south of Sinjar, after the whole population had received the jihadist ultimatum to convert or be killed, over 80 men were killed. A witness recounted that the villagers were first converted under duress, but when the village elder refused to convert, all of the men were taken in trucks under the pretext of being led to Sinjar, and gunned down along the way. According to reports from survivors interviewed by OHCHR, on 15 August, the entire male population of the Yazidi village of Khocho, up to 400 men, were rounded up and shot by ISIL, and up to 1,000 women and children were abducted. On the same day, up to 200 Yazidi men were reportedly executed for refusing conversion in a Tal Afar prison. The massacres took place at least until 25 August when ISIL executed 14 elderly Yazidi men in Sheikh Mand Shrine in Jidala, western Sinjar, and blew up the shrine there. 40,000 or more Yazidis were trapped in the Sinjar Mountains and mostly surrounded by ISIL forces who were firing on them. They were largely without food, water or medical care, facing starvation and dehydration. Death toll By 2014, a U.N. Humans Rights commission counted that 9,347 civilians had been murdered by ISIL in Iraq, then however; by 2016 a second report by the United Nations estimated 18,802 deaths.

ISIL fighters have reportedly been given written directions to kill or capture journalists. In December 2013, two suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of TV station Salaheddin and killed five journalists, after accusing the station of \\"distorting the image of Iraq's Sunni community\\". Reporters Without Borders reported that on 7 September 2014, ISIL seized and on 11 October publicly beheaded Raad al- Azzawi, a TV Salaheddin cameraman from the village of Samra, east of Tikrit. , according to the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, ISIL is holding nine journalists and has nine others under close observation in Mosul and Salahuddin province. During 2013 and part of 2014, an ISIL unit nicknamed the Beatles acquired and held 12 Western journalists hostage, along with aid workers and other foreign hostages, totalling 23 or 24 known hostages. A Polish journalist Marcin Suder was captured in July 2013 but escaped four months later. The unit executed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and released beheading videos. Eight of the other journalists were released for ransom: Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, French journalists Didier Fran√ßois, Edouard Elias, Nicolas H√©nin, and Pierre Torres, and Spanish journalists Marc Marginedas, Javier Espinosa, and Ricardo Garc√≠a Vilanova. The unit continues to hold hostage British journalist John Cantlie and a female aid worker. Cyber-security group the Citizen Lab released a report finding a possible link between ISIL and a digital attack on the Syrian citizen media group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RSS). Supporters of the media group received an emailed link to an image of supposed airstrikes, but clicking on the link introduced malware to the user's computer that sends details of the user's IP address and system each time it restarts. That information has been enough to allow ISIL to locate RSS supporters. \\"The group has been targeted for kidnappings, house raids, and at least one alleged targeted killing. At the time of that writing, ISIL was allegedly holding several citizen journalists in Raqqa\\", according to the Citizen Lab report. On 8 January 2015, ISIL members in Libya claimed to have executed Tunisian journalists Sofiene Chourabi and Nadhir Ktari who disappeared in September 2014. Also in January 2015, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto was kidnapped and beheaded, after a demand for a $200 million ransom payment was not met. = Beheadings and mass executions = An unknown number of Syrians and Iraqis, several Lebanese soldiers, male and female Kurdish fighters near Koban√Æ, two American journalists, one American and two British aid workers, 30 Ethiopian Christians and 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya have been beheaded by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL uses beheadings to intimidate local populations and has released a series of propaganda videos aimed at Western countries. ISIL was reported to have beheaded about 100 foreign fighters as deserters who tried to leave Raqqa. They also engage in public and mass executions of Syrian and Iraqi soldiers and civilians, sometimes forcing prisoners to dig their own graves before shooting lines of prisoners and pushing them in. Among the known mass executions of captured soldiers carried out by ISIL are those in Tikrit (ISIS executed up to 1,700 Shia Iraqi Air Force cadets from Camp Speicher near Tikrit on 12 June 2014), Al-Thawrah (ISIS executed 250 Syrian soldiers captured at the Al-Tabqa air base between 27 and 28 August 2014), Palmyra (up to 280 Syrian soldiers and government loyalists were shot in the head or beheaded in a public square on 22 May 2015), and Deir ez-Zor (ISIS killed at least 300 Syrian soldiers, pro-government militiamen and their families on 16 January 2016). ISIL executed 600 Shia prisoners in Mosul in June 2014.\\"Isis kills hundreds of Iraqi Sunnis from Albu Nimr tribe in Anbar province \\". The Guardian. 30 October 2014. In November 2014, there were reports that ISIL fighters massacred more than 630 members of the Albu Nimr tribe in Iraq. Albu Nimr was one of the Sunni Arab tribes that fiercely opposed ISIL.\\"IS Massacres 70 More Tribesmen In Iraqi Revenge Attack \\". Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty/Radio Liberty/Radio Liberty. 10 November 2014 On 17 December 2014, it was reported by Turkish media, that ISIL had executed at least 150 women from the Albu Nimr tribe in Falluja for refusing to marry ISIL militants. = Use of chemical weapons = A destroyed ISIL chemical weapons factory in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, Syria, 9 March 2017 The Islamic State began a program in 2014 to make chemical weapons using both chlorine and a World War I-era toxin known as sulfur mustard. Kurds in northern Iraq reported being attacked by ISIL with chemical weapons in August 2015, which was later confirmed to be mustard gas. At Koban√Æ, it is highly likely that ISIL used chlorine gas. These chemical weapons may have been from a chemical weapons storage site at Al-Muthanna, which contained 2,500 chemical rockets. Although the rockets' chemical contents were deteriorated, ISIL may have used them in a concentrated manner. = Destruction of cultural and religious heritage = UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova has warned that ISIL is destroying Iraq's cultural heritage, in what she has called \\"cultural cleansing\\". \\"We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history\\", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, \\"This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it goes hand in hand with genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate ‚Äì to delete ‚Äì the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable.\\" Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, \\"For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians ‚Äì it really is a threat beyond belief.\\" Temple of Bel in Palmyra, which was destroyed by ISIL in August 2015 To finance its activities, ISIL is stealing artefacts from Syria and Iraq and sending them to Europe to be sold. UNESCO has asked for United Nations Security Council controls on the sale of antiquities, similar to those imposed after the 2003 Iraq War. UNESCO is working with Interpol, national customs authorities, museums, and major auction houses in attempts to prevent looted items from being sold. ISIL occupied Mosul Museum, the second most important museum in Iraq, as it was about to reopen after years of rebuilding following the Iraq War, saying that the statues were against Islam and threatening to destroy the museum's contents. ISIL considers worshipping at graves tantamount to idolatry, and seeks to purify the community of unbelievers. It has used bulldozers to crush buildings and archaeological sites. Bernard Haykel has described al-Baghdadi's creed as \\"a kind of untamed Wahhabism\\", saying, \\"For Al Qaeda, violence is a means to an ends; for ISIS, it is an end in itself\\". The destruction by ISIL in July 2014 of the tomb and shrine of the prophet Yunus ‚Äì Jonah in Christianity ‚Äì the 13th-century mosque of Imam Yahya Abu al-Qassimin, the 14th-century shrine of prophet Jerjis ‚Äì St George to Christians ‚Äì and the attempted destruction of the Hadba minaret at the 12th-century Great Mosque of Al-Nuri have been described as \\"an unchecked outburst of extreme Wahhabism\\". \\"There were explosions that destroyed buildings dating back to the Assyrian era\\", said National Museum of Iraq director Qais Rashid, referring to the destruction of the shrine of Yunus. He cited another case where \\"Daesh (ISIL) gathered over 1,500 manuscripts from convents and other holy places and burnt all of them in the middle of the city square\\". In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed the 13th-century BC Assyrian city of Nimrud, believing its sculptures to be idolatrous. UNESCO head, Irina Bokova, deemed this to be a war crime. ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from the various locations including the Central Library of Mosul (which they rigged with explosives and burned down), the library at the University of Mosul, a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BCE and include \\"Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul's establishment families.\\" The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books. An investigation led by the Human Rights Watch disclosed that Al-Hota gorge that was once a beautiful natural site in northeastern Syria is used by the ISIS as a disposal ground for the bodies of people killed by them. The HRW investigation involved analysis of evidence such as, ISIS videos, interviews with locals, along with satellite images and drone footages of the gorge.  Treatment of civilians  During the Iraqi conflict in 2014, ISIL released dozens of videos showing its ill treatment of civilians, many of whom had apparently been targeted on the basis of their religion or ethnicity. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned of war crimes being committed in the Iraqi war zone, and disclosed a UN report of ISIL militants murdering Iraqi Army soldiers and 17 civilians in a single street in Mosul. The UN reported that in the 17 days from 5 to 22 June, ISIL killed more than 1,000 Iraqi civilians and injured more than 1,000. After ISIL released photographs of its fighters shooting scores of young men, the UN declared that cold-blooded \\"executions\\" by militants in northern Iraq almost certainly amounted to war crimes. ISIL's advance in Iraq in mid-2014 was accompanied by continuing violence in Syria. On 29 May, ISIL raided a village in Syria and at least 15 civilians were killed, including, according to Human Rights Watch, at least six children. A hospital in the area confirmed that it had received 15 bodies on the same day. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that on 1 June, a 102-year- old man was killed along with his whole family in a village in Hama province. According to Reuters, 1,878 people were killed in Syria by ISIL during the last six months of 2014, most of them civilians. During its occupation of Mosul, ISIL implemented a sharia school curriculum which banned the teaching of art, music, national history, literature and Christianity. Although Charles Darwin's theory of evolution has never been taught in Iraqi schools, that subject was also banned from the school curriculum. Patriotic songs were declared blasphemous, and orders were given to remove certain pictures from school textbooks. Iraqi parents largely boycotted schools in which the new curriculum was introduced. After capturing cities in Iraq, ISIL issued guidelines on how to wear clothes and veils. ISIL warned women in the city of Mosul to wear full-face veils or face severe punishment. A cleric told Reuters in Mosul that ISIL gunmen had ordered him to read out the warning in his mosque when worshippers gathered. ISIL ordered the faces of both male and female mannequins to be covered, in an order which also banned the use of naked mannequins. In Raqqa the group used its two battalions of female fighters in the city to enforce compliance by women with its strict laws on individual conduct. ISIL released 16 notes labelled \\"Contract of the City\\", a set of rules aimed at civilians in Nineveh. One rule stipulated that women should stay at home and not go outside unless necessary. Another rule said that stealing would be punished by amputation. In addition to banning the sale and use of alcohol, ISIL banned the sale and use of cigarettes and hookah pipes. It also banned \\"music and songs in cars, at parties, in shops and in public, as well as photographs of people in shop windows\\". According to The Economist, the group also adopted certain practices seen in Saudi Arabia, including the establishment of religious police to root out \\"vice\\" and enforce attendance at daily prayers, the widespread use of capital punishment, and the destruction of Christian churches and non-Sunni mosques or their conversion to other uses. ISIL carried out executions on both men and women who were accused of various acts and found guilty of crimes against Islam such as sodomy, adultery, usage and possession of contraband, rape, blasphemy, witchcraft,\\"IS beheads two civilian women in Syria: monitor \\". Yahoo News. 30 June 2015. renouncing Islam and murder. Before the accused are executed their charges are read to them and the spectators. Executions take various forms, including stoning to death, crucifixions, beheadings, burning people alive, and throwing people from tall buildings. The Islamic State in Iraq frequently carried out mass executions in Mosul and Hawija. The Islamic State militants were accused of using civilian residents of towns as human shields. The Telegraph reported that \\"Extremist fighters are deliberately hiding among civilian buildings and residents to try to prevent strikes.\\" Civil rights activist told ARA News that \\"ISIS militants prevent the people of Manbij and Jarablus from leaving their hometowns despite the fierce airstrikes by Russian warplanes\\". The use of human shields and executions of civilians who tried to flee continued in Iraq right through until the group lost is final major urban territory there after its defeat in the Battle for Mosul in July 2017. In August 2019, the terror group claimed responsibility of the suicide bomb attack in a crowded wedding hall in Kabul. It marked one of the most devastating attacks on civilians in years of conflict and terror, where nearly 63 people died and more than 180 were wounded. = Child soldiers = According to a report by the magazine Foreign Policy, children as young as six are recruited or kidnapped and sent to military and religious training camps, where they practice beheading with dolls and are indoctrinated with the religious views of ISIL. Children are used as human shields on front lines and to provide blood transfusions for Islamic State soldiers, according to Shelly Whitman of the Rom√©o Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative. The second instalment of a Vice News documentary about ISIL focused on how the group is specifically grooming children for the future. A spokesman told VICE News that those under the age of 15 go to sharia camp to learn about religion, while those older than 16 can go to military training camp. Children are also used for propaganda. According to a UN report, \\"In mid-August, ISIL entered a cancer hospital in Mosul, forced at least two sick children to hold the ISIL flag and posted the pictures on the internet.\\" Misty Buswell, a Save the Children representative working with refugees in Jordan, said, \\"It's not an exaggeration to say we could lose a whole generation of children to trauma.\\" A UN report indicated that at least 89 children, mostly from the ages of 12 to 16 had been killed fighting for the Islamic State in 2015, 39% of which died in suicide bombing attacks. Der Spiegel estimated in 2016 that 1,500 boys were serving as child soldiers for ISIL. It was reported that on 12 March 2017, ISIL used 6 child suicide bombers against the Syrian Army soldiers besieged in Deir ez-Zor. = Sexual violence and slavery = Sexual violence perpetrated by ISIL includes using rape as a weapon of war; instituting forced marriages to its fighters; and trading women and girls as sex slaves. There are many reports of sexual abuse and enslavement in ISIL-controlled areas of women and girls, predominantly from the minority Christian and Yazidi communities. Fighters are told that they are free to have sex with or rape non-Muslim captive women. Haleh Esfandiari from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has highlighted the abuse of local women by ISIL militants after they have captured an area. \\"They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them. The younger girls ... are raped or married off to fighters\\", she said, adding, \\"It's based on temporary marriages, and once these fighters have had sex with these young girls, they just pass them on to other fighters.\\" The capture of Iraqi cities by the group in June 2014 was accompanied by an upsurge in crimes against women, including kidnap and rape. According to Martin Williams in The Citizen, some hard-line Salafists apparently regard extramarital sex with multiple partners as a legitimate form of holy war and it is \\"difficult to reconcile this with a religion where some adherents insist that women must be covered from head to toe, with only a narrow slit for the eyes\\". , the trade in sex slaves appeared to remain restricted to Yazidi women and girls. It has reportedly become a recruiting technique to attract men from conservative Muslim societies, where dating and casual sex are not allowed. Nazand Begikhani said of the Yazidi victims, \\"These women have been treated like cattle ... They have been subjected to physical and sexual violence, including systematic rape and sex slavery. They've been exposed in markets in Mosul and in Raqqa, Syria, carrying price tags.\\" According to UN Reports the price list for IS sex slaves range from 40 to 160 US dollars. The younger the slave the more expensive. Girls and boys between the age 1‚Äì9 are referred to as the most expensive, with the cheapest being women between 40 and 50 years old. According to another source the price of a slave equals the price of an AK-47. A United Nations report issued on 2 October 2014, based on 500 interviews with witnesses, said that ISIL took 450‚Äì500 women and girls to Iraq's Nineveh region in August, where \\"150 unmarried girls and women, predominantly from the Yazidi and Christian communities, were reportedly transported to Syria, either to be given to ISIL fighters as a reward or to be sold as sex slaves\\". In mid- October, the UN confirmed that 5,000‚Äì7,000 Yazidi women and children had been abducted by ISIL and sold into slavery. In November 2014 The New York Times reported on the accounts given by five who escaped ISIL of their captivity and abuse. In December 2014, the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights announced that ISIL had killed over 150 women and girls in Fallujah who refused to participate in sexual jihad. Non-Muslim women have reportedly been married off to fighters against their will. ISIL claims the women provide the new converts and children necessary to spread ISIL's control. Shortly after the death of US hostage Kayla Mueller was confirmed on 10 February 2015, several media outlets reported that the US intelligence community believed she may have been given as a wife to an ISIL fighter. In August 2015 it was confirmed that she had been forced into marriage to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who raped her repeatedly. The Mueller family was informed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had sexually abused Ms. Mueller, and that Ms. Mueller had also been tortured. Abu Sayyaf's widow, Umm Sayyaf, confirmed that it was her husband who had been Mueller's primary abuser. In its digital magazine Dabiq, ISIL explicitly claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women. According to The Wall Street Journal, ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims \\"justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor to the end of the world\\". ISIL appeals to the hadith and Quran when claiming the right to enslave and rape captive non-Muslim women. According to Dabiq, \\"enslaving the families of the kuffar and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia's that if one were to deny or mock, he would be denying or mocking the verses of the Quran and the narration of the Prophet ... and thereby apostatizing from Islam.\\" Captured Yazidi women and children are divided among the fighters who captured them, with one-fifth taken as a tax. ISIL has received widespread criticism from Muslim scholars and others in the Muslim world for using part of the Quran to derive a ruling in isolation, rather than considering the entire Quran and hadith. According to Mona Siddiqui, ISIL's \\"narrative may well be wrapped up in the familiar language of jihad and 'fighting in the cause of Allah', but it amounts to little more than destruction of anything and anyone who doesn't agree with them\\"; she describes ISIL as reflecting a \\"lethal mix of violence and sexual power\\" and a \\"deeply flawed view of manhood\\". Dabiq describes \\"this large-scale enslavement\\" of non-Muslims as \\"probably the first since the abandonment of Shariah law\\". YJ√ä are women fighters trained by the Kurdish Workers Party guerillas to defend themselves against Islamist extremists. In late 2014, ISIL released a pamphlet that focused on the treatment of female slaves. It claims that the Quran allows fighters to have sex with captives, including adolescent girls, and to beat slaves as discipline. The pamphlet's guidelines also allow fighters to trade slaves, including for sex, as long as they have not been impregnated by their owners. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the counter- extremist think tank Quilliam, described the pamphlet as \\"abhorrent\\". In response to this document Abbas Barzegar, a religion professor at Georgia State University, said Muslims around the world find ISIL's \\"alien interpretation of Islam grotesque and abhorrent\\". Muslim leaders and scholars from around the world have rejected the validity of ISIL's claims, claiming that the reintroduction of slavery is un-Islamic, that they are required to protect \\"People of the Scripture\\" including Christians, Jews, Muslims and Yazidis, and that ISIL's fatwas are invalid due to their lack of religious authority and the fatwas' inconsistency with Islam. The Independent reported in 2015 that the usage of Yazidi sex slaves had created ongoing friction among fighters within ISIL. Sajad Jiyad, a Research Fellow and Associate Member at the Iraqi Institute for Economic Reform, told the newspaper that many ISIL supporters and fighters had been in denial about the trafficking of kidnapped Yazidi women until a Dabiq article justifying the practice was published. The New York Times said in August 2015 that \\"[t]he systematic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State in the year since the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution.\\" The article claims that ISIL is not merely exonerating but sacralising rape, and illustrated this with the testimony of escapees. One 15-year-old victim said that, while she was being assaulted, her rapist \\"kept telling me this is ibadah\\"; a 12-year-old victim related how her assailant claimed that, \\"by raping me, he is drawing closer to God\\"; and one adult prisoner told how, when she challenged her captor about repeatedly raping a 12 year old, she was met with the retort, \\"No, she's not a little girl, she's a slave and she knows exactly how to have sex and having sex with her pleases God.\\" In July 2016 it was reported by an AP investigation that ISIL was using mobile apps like Telegram to sell their sex slaves and identify the slaves of other ISIL members at checkpoints. In 2016, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability said they had identified 34 senior ISIL members who were instrumental in the systematic sex slave trade and planned to prosecute them after the end of hostilities. = Slave trade = ISIL announced the revival of slavery as an institution. In 2015, the official slave prices set by ISIL were following: *Children aged 1 to 9 were sold for 200,000 dinars ($169). *Women and children 10 to 20 years old for 150,000 dinars ($127). *Women 20 to 30 years old for 100,000 dinar ($85). *Women 30 to 40 years old are 75,000 dinar ($63). *Women 40 to 50 years old for 50,000 dinar ($42). However, some slaves have been sold for as little as a pack of cigarettes. Sex slaves were sold to Saudi Arabia, other Persian Gulf countries and Turkey. = LGBT rights = = Allegations of organ trafficking = The group released a fatwa permitting the removal of organs from non-Muslim captives. The document says that \\"The apostate's life and organs don't have to be respected and may be taken with impunity.\\" The document seems to define apostate as non-Muslim though Shia Muslim captives may also be endangered by the fatwa due to ISIL's extreme interpretation of Islam. The document also claims ISIL authorizes the removal of organs from captives even when it may kill them. Iraq has accused the group of harvesting human organs for profit.

He was born at Southfleet in Kent and died at Bournemouth, then in Hampshire, now in Dorset. Ottey was educated at Rugby School and at St John's College, Cambridge. In cricket he had success as a bowler and his batting figures are not impressive by modern standards; in a few matches, however, he opened the batting. It is not known if he batted or bowled right- or left-handed. He played in several of Cambridge University's first-class games in the 1844, 1845 and 1846 seasons, appearing in the University Match against Oxford University each year, and reappeared in 1847 for a fourth University Match, though that was his only game of that season. He twice took six wickets in an innings, though the full scorecards for most of his games are not available. In his final University Match of 1847, his last game of first-class cricket, he shared all 20 Oxford wickets with John Lee, each taking 10 in the match. Ottey graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1847 and was ordained as a Church of England priest. He served as curate in parishes in Worcester, Lewisham and Whitechapel, and from 1871 to 1886 he was the inspector of schools for the Diocese of London and, from 1876, prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral; from 1886 until he retired in 1889 he was rector of Much Hadham in Hertfordshire. Ottey was an author. His books included an 1867 volume called The Dragon Bound and Loosed which debates whether the Millennium might have begun between A.D. 789 and 867, and would therefore end no later than 1867. Later works included scripted lessons for Sunday School teachers.

The movements aimed for the resignation of Sharif, over claims of governmental manipulations in the 2013 general election. Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad, the leader of Awami Muslim League (Pakistan) initially introduced the anti-government chant after Nawaz Sharif refused to step down as Prime Minister in September 2014. The slogan was later popularised by Imran Khan, the leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf who ran a protest movement simultaneously. This chant was also used by Tahir-ul-Qadri, the leader of Pakistan Awami Tehreek. The slogan became vastly popular, receiving circulation in a short span of time, and its use has been extended into protests, public demonstrations, while also gaining popularity in non- political situations. Over time, the chant \\"Go Nawaz Go\\" became hugely popular and had been used many times at different events. On some occasions, the controversial slogan was chanted where members, and ministers of the PML(N) were present which caused the members and ministers as well relatives of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif to hurriedly leave the area to avoid the embarrassing situation. One of the other notable incidents where the chant caused chaos was during a graduation ceremony in University of Peshawar, when a student refused to receive the graduation certificate from the governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and chanted \\"Go Nawaz Go\\" causing a major embarrassment, while Karachi University also cancelled a ceremony in which laptops were to have been distributed amongst students, amid fears of slogan. Gullu Butt also chanted \\"Go Nawaz Go\\" when he was sentenced to 11 years in jail but later got out by order of court. Upon Nawaz's visit to US in order to attend 69th session of United Nations General Assembly, a large number of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf protestorsgathered outside the UN office and chanted \\"Go Nawaz Go\\". After Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made some international tours to China, Germany and United Kingdom, Imran Khan said that Nawaz Sharif has misunderstood the meaning of \\"Go Nawaz Go\\", clarifying that, \\"Go Nawaz Go\\" does not mean going on international tours. Imran also announced to mark a day as \\"Go Nawaz Go Day\\". The slogan has also been used by spectators during sports events and matches, such as cricket.

Production  The series was filmed in Staithes in Yorkshire, and the scenery of the area is heavily featured in the episodes. Bernard Cribbins talking about the location, said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve filmed in a lot of locations throughout my career, but there‚Äôs something about the sea air, the beauty and the friendliness in Staithes that makes it a special place to be.‚Äù The first two series each had two stories written by Russell T Davies, with whom Bernard Cribbins had previously worked on Doctor Who. This was the first time Davies had ever written for a pre-school audience. On writing for pre-schoolers Davies said \\"It‚Äôs exciting new territory for me, writing for this age range. But this is the age when your imagination first starts!

Prayatna does not merely mean 'effort' but 'effort at a point of articulation'. Meaning Prayatna (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡§É) means ‚Äì 'effort', 'exertion', 'endeavour', 'perseverance', 'activity' or 'action in general'. PƒÅ·πáini explains that prayatna does not merely mean effort but effort at a point of articulation; it expresses a sense of human determination and initiative and needs to be supplemented by confidence in one‚Äôs own abilities and steadfastness of purpose which makes prayatna a driving force. Implication Prayatna implies energy (vƒ´rya) and enthusiasm (utsaha) directed towards strenuous efforts (anusthƒÅna) for attaining the state of equipoise (sthiti) in undisturbed calm (pra≈õƒÅnta-vƒÅhitƒÅ) under the influence of sattva-guna. It is a part of energetic and enthusiastic pursuit abhyƒÅsa, and an act (kriti) prompted by the desire or will (icchƒÅ) that involves physical exertion (che≈õ»õƒÅ) Actions are of two kinds ‚Äì i) vital actions prompted by life (jƒ´vana-p≈´rvaka), and ii) voluntary actions initiated by desire and aversion (icchƒÅ-dve≈õa-p≈´rvaka). Vital actions are non-voluntary produced by the conjunction of the self with the internal organ which depends on the self, and all voluntary actions are produced by desire and aversion that produce merits and demerits. Empirical pleasure arises from the fulfilment of these actions but transcendental bliss arises from their extermination. Prayatna ('volition') finds its fullest expression within intentional action. According to the Vaisesika school of Mimamsa thought, karma is movement or action in which there is no effect to differentiate an intentional action from an unintentional one; karma excludes all kinds of mental acts, and prayatna in itself is not a karma but a quality of the self that shares a common violational trait with sankalpa ('chosen resolution'). Prayatna ('effort') is one of the five avasthƒÅs ('stages of action') viz., the second stage, the other four being ƒÅrambha ('the beginning'), prƒÅptayƒÅ≈õƒÅ ('prospect of success'), niyatƒÅpti ('certainty of success') and phalagƒÅma or phalayoga ('attainment of result'). Karya ('action') consists of one of the three objects of human existence. Prayatna ('effort') is exertion attended with great haste, when result has not been obtained. Uneven progress indicates uneven stages. PƒÅ·πáƒ´niya-≈õik≈õƒÅ states that in Indian phonetics, sounds are distinguished from each other on the basis of swaras ('accents'), kƒÅla ('time or duration'), sthƒÅna ('point of articulation'), prayatna ('manner') and 'anupradƒÅna' ('type of phonation'), where prayatna, here meaning 'manner', refers to how the physical organ called kƒÅra·πáa ('articulator') relates to the point of articulation, spar≈õa ('contact'), 'upasamhara' ('approximation'), vivarta ('open') etc. Sukta I.i.9 reads ‚Äì :‡§§‡•Å‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç  meaning ‚Äì \\"those whose place of utterance and effort are equal are called savar·πáa or homogenous letters\\" i.e. when the sthƒÅna ('place of utterance') and prayatna ('effort') are the same; the inner effort is called abhyantara (which are of four kinds), and external called bhaya. According to the Nyaya School there are three groups of prayatna ‚Äì pravrtti, nivrtti and jivanaprayatna, the former two are citta vrttis, the third being efforts made by individuals to maintain life; in Yoga philosophy, prayatna means - the effort of breathing which in the practice of ƒÅsanas must be smooth and regular, and prayatna ≈õaithilya means the exact and even weighing of effort and effortlessness; ≈õaithilya means laxity, and this state is experienced when the pinnacle of intelligence holds the body on its own, unaided and effortlessly. Significance Kriya ('action') is the nature of prayatna or personal effort, and there can be no effort without a body; prayatna is a quality which emerges in the embodied self and is associated with manas ('mind'). Caraka Sutras list the gu·πáas beginning with para ('universality') and ending with prayatna ('effort') together with sartha ('sense-qualities') in which list buddhi does not figure but is separately enumerated. Prayatna is conscious activity, which in-coordination with desire, antipathy, pleasure, pain and knowledge indicates the existence of the self.

It defended the important naval base of Portsmouth during The Blitz. Origins 35th Anti-Aircraft (AA) Brigade was formed on 1 April 1938 at Fort Fareham in Hampshire, and was commanded by Brigadier R.B. Purey Cust (appointed 16 May 1938). It was assigned to 5th AA Division when that formation was created on 1 September 1938.Frederick, pp. 1048‚Äì51.Monthly Army List 1938‚Äì39.Farndale, Annex J. =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. =Order of battle 1939= On the outbreak of World War II, 35 AA Brigade comprised the following units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE):AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LX, p. 378. * 56th (Cornwall) Anti- Aircraft Regiment, RALitchfield, pp. 34‚Äì5. ** HQ at Falmouth ** 165th (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Redruth ** 201st (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Padstow ** 202nd (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Par ** 203rd (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Penzance * 57th (Wessex) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RALitchfield, pp. 89‚Äì91.57 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Portsmouth ** 213th (Portsmouth) Anti-Aircraft Battery ** 214th (Southsea) Anti-Aircraft Battery ** 215th (Gosport & Fareham) Anti-Aircraft Battery ** 216th (Isle of Wight & Cosham)) Anti-Aircraft Battery * 72nd (Hampshire) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA ‚Äì Heavy AA unit formed in 1938 by conversion of 95th (Hampshire) Field Brigade, RALitchfield, p. 95. ** HQ at Southampton ** 217th (Hampshire Carabiniers) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Winchester ** 218th (Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Southampton ** 310th Anti-Aircraft Battery ‚Äì formed January 1939 at Parkstone, Dorset * 48th (Hampshire) Anti- Aircraft Battalion, RE ‚Äì searchlight regiment organised in 1937 from Hampshire Fortress Engineers, RELitchfield, p. 97.48 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 ** HQ at Portsmouth ** 391st Anti-Aircraft Company at Portsmouth ** 392nd Anti-Aircraft Company at East Cowes, Isle of Wight ** 393rd Anti-Aircraft Company at Gosport ** 394th Anti-Aircraft Company at Southampton * 35th Anti-Aircraft Brigade Company, Royal Army Service Corps Together with the searchlights of 27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, 35 AA Bde was responsible for the air defence of the city and naval base of Portsmouth. In September 1939, the brigade had 29 heavy AA guns round Portsmouth.Routledge, Table LIX, p. 377, During 1940 the AA regiments of the RA were designated 'Heavy AA', and the RE units transferred to the RA as 'Searchlight Regiments'.Litchfield. By July 1940 there were 44 HAA guns deployed round Portsmouth.Farndale, p. 106. Battle of Britain and Blitz The brigade was heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain. A few bombers got through to Portsmouth on 10 July,Collier, Chapter 10. and the Portsmouth and Southampton AA guns were in action on 15 August, claiming one 'kill',Coller, Chapter 12. Again, on 18 August, German air raids crossed Southern England and appeared over RAF airfields at West Malling, Manston, Kenley, Biggin Hill, Gravesend and the town of Sevenoaks, all within four and a half hours in the afternoon. The guns of 35 AA Bde and its neighbours were in action and accounted for 23 enemy aircraft.Routledge, p. 383. On 24 August a raid eluded RAF Fighter Command's fighters and bombed the city and dockyard badly, killing over 100 people despite the efforts of the AA guns, although another raid two days later was driven off by fighters and AA fire, and only dropped a few bombs on the outskirts of the city.Collier, Chapter 13.Collier, Appendix XIV. This was the start of the Portsmouth Blitz). After 15 September, the intensity of Luftwaffe daylight attacks fell, and the emphasis switched to night bombing of industrial towns (the Blitz). Portsmouth was a major target: during a succession of attacks, two bombs fell on a gun position of 35 AA Bde, killing an officer and 10 men, wrecking the command post and one gun. Two of the remaining guns continued to fire by improvised methods.Routledge, p. 395. The city was badly bombed on the nights of 5 December 1940, 10 January, 10 March, 17 and 27 April 1941.Collier, Chapter 17.Collier, Appendix XXX.Collier, Appendix XXXI. =Order of Battle 1940‚Äì41= During the Blitz, 35 AA Bde had the following composition:5 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45 Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 258. * 72 HAA Rgt RA ‚Äì as above * 48 S/L Rgt RA ‚Äì as above * 80th (Berkshire) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery - formed in 1938 by expansion of 264th (Berkshire) Field Battery of 66th (South Midland) Field Brigade, RALitchfield, p. 21. ** HQ at Reading, Berkshire ** 249 (Berkshire Royal Horse Artillery) at Reading ** 250 (Reading) at Reading ** 251 (Buckinghamshire) at Slough ** 252 (City of Oxford) at Oxford * 118th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery ‚Äì new regiment formed in December 1940 Mid-War 5 AA Divisional sign, worn 1940‚Äì42 The Blitz ended in May 1941, but there were occasional raids thereafter and AA Command continued to strengthen its defences. Newly-formed units joining AA Command were increasingly 'mixed' ones into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated, while those armed with Z Battery rocket projectiles were partly manned by members of the Home Guard.Pile's despatch.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì404. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for Operation Torch. The AA defences of Southern England were severely tested in the summer of 1942 by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and-run' attacks along the South Coast, and there was much reorganisation, accounting for some of the turnover of units listed earlier. LAA units waiting to go overseas were sometimes lent back to AA Command to deal with the hit-and-run raiders.Collier, Chapter XX. =Order of Battle 1941‚Äì42= Over the two years following the Blitz, the brigade had the following changes in composition:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. * 54th (City of London) HAA Rgt ‚Äì joined from 1 AA Division autumn 1941; returned to 1 AA Division February 1942 ** 160, 161, 312 HAA Btys ** 428 Bty ‚Äì transferred to 131st HAA Rgt December 1941 * 57th (Wessex) HAA Rgt ‚Äì left for 1 AA Division autumn 1941 ** 213, 214, 215 HAA Btys ** 219 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 27 AA Bde from May 1941; transferred to new 124th HAA Rgt summer 1941 ** 430 HAA Bty ‚Äì joined summer 1941 * 72nd (Hampshire) HAA Rgt ‚Äì left for 6 AA Division December 1941 ** 217, 218, 393 HAA Btys ** 310 HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred to new 131st HAA Rgt August 1941 * 80th (Berkshire) HAA Rgt ‚Äì left AA Command July 1941; later went to North AfricaRoutledge, p. 178.Joslen, p. 465. ** 250 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 65 AA Bde ** 251, 252 HAA Btys * 97th (London Scottish) HAA Rgt ‚Äì joined from 1 AA Division March 1942; to 5 AA Bde June 1942 ** 298, 319 HAA Btys ** 299, 376 HAA Btys ‚Äì attached to 1 AA Division An ATS spotter at a 3.7-inch AA gun site, December 1942 * 101st HAA Rgt ‚Äì joined from 6 AA Division July 1942; left for 1 AA Division August 1942 *** 226, 297, 379, 427 HAA Btys * 104th HAA Rgt ‚Äì joined from 8 AA Division December 1941, left for 6 AA Division April 1942 ** 328, 329, 336, 452 HAA Btys * 107th HAA Rgt ‚Äì from 27 AA Bde June 1942; left for 5 AA Bde November 1942 ** 334, 335, 337 HAA Btys ** 390 HAA Bty ‚Äì left August 1942 * 124th HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed March 1941;Farndale, Annex M. left for 27 AA Bde autumn 1941 ** 219 HAA Bty ‚Äì joined from 57th (Wessex) HAA Rgt summer 1941 ** 410 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 9 AA Division until July 1941 ** 412 HAA Bty ** 415 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 27 AA Bde until May 1941 * 126th HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed July 1941; left for 12 AA Division July 1942 ** 423, 425, 426 HAA Btys ** 431 HAA Bty ‚Äì joined from 102nd HAA Rgt July 1942 * 131st HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed August 1941; left for 6 AA Division July 1942 ** 310 HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred from 72nd HAA Rgt ** 368 HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred from 116th HAA Rgt; attached to 8 AA Division ** 376 HAA Bty‚Äì transferred from 97th (London Scottish) HAA Rgt July 1942 ** 428 HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred from 54th HAA Rgt December 1941 ** 458 HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred to new 160th (Mixed) HAA Rgt August 1942 * 146th HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed January 1942; left for 27 AA Bde autumn 1941 ** 176, 339, 414, 465 HAA Btys * 148th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed February 1942; to 5 AA Bde June, returned November 1942 ** 505 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred to new 157th (M) HAA Rgt May 1942 ** 508, 523 (M) HAA Btys ** 529 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äì joined June 1942 * 151st (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì from 4 AA Division July 1942 ** 510, 511, 514, 516 (M) HAA Btys * 157th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed May 1942 ** 539, 550, 551 (M) HAA Btys * 160th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì new unit formed June 1942 ** 458 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äì transferred from 131st HAA Rgt ** 556 (M) HAA Bty ** 508, 523, 529 (M) HAA Btys ‚Äì transferred from 148th HAA Rgt Spring 1943 * 101st (King's Regiment (Liverpool)) LAA Rgt ‚Äì joined July 1942; left AA Command for Middle East Forces by October 1942Routledge, Table XXV, p. 164.Joslen, p. 484. ** 226, 297, 379 LAA Btys * 48th (Hampshire) S/L Rgt ‚Äì from 47 AA Bde August 1942; returned to 47 AA Bde November 1942 ** 391, 392, 393, 394 S/L Btys * 5th AA 'Z' Rgt ** 102, 114 Z Btys ** 112, 127 Z Btys ‚Äì joined May 1941 * 35 AA Bde Signal Office Mixed Sub-Section (part of No 2 Company, 5 AA Division Mixed Signal Unit, Royal Corps of Signals) =Order of Battle 1942‚Äì43= AA Command shoulder patch worn 1942‚Äì55 The AA Divisions were disbanded on 30 September and replaced by new AA Groups that corresponded with the groups of RAF Fighter Command. 35 AA Brigade joined the new 2 AA Group covering South East England.Routledge, pp 400‚Äì1; Map 36.

At this time, the brigade's HQ establishment was 9 officers, 8 male other ranks and 25 members of the ATS, together with a small number of attached drivers, cooks and mess orderlies (male and female). In addition, the brigade had a Mixed Signal Office Section of 5 male other ranks and 19 ATS, which was formally part of the Group signal unit.AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148. =Order of Battle 1945= By this stage of the war, AA Command's strength was diminishing as manpower had to be released to 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe, and batteries and whole regiments were disbanded or converted other roles. By the end of the year 35 AA Bde was composed as follows: * 134th (M) HAA Rgt ** 459, 460, 461, 583 (M) HAA Btys * 159th (M) HAA Rgt ** 542, 543 (M) HAA Btys * 185th (M) HAA Rgt ** 601, 618 * 3rd LAA Rgt ** 9, 114, 126 LAA Btys Shortly afterwards, 6 AA Group was disbanded, and by February 1945, 35 AA Bde had returned to the command of 2 AA Group with just 2nd and 5th AA Area Mixed Rgt HQs under its command (the Home Guard had been stood down and all the Z Btys had disappeared). After VE- Day, the brigade was responsible for 5 and 6 Area AA Maintenance HQs, and for the only fully Mixed searchlight regiments, 26th and 93rd. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 35 AA Bde's Regular Army units reformed 10 AA Bde while the TA portion was renumbered as 61 AA Brigade (TA), both at Fareham.

The young activist had participated in a protest on 3 December 2013 to call for justice and retribution for Khaled Saeed, the man who was tortured to death in June 2010 and later became one of the symbols of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. She was released in September 2014, only to be sentenced on a different charge, in May 2015, when under the Morsi presidency, El-Masry and a group of lawyers started a sit-in in front of El- Raml police station in Alexandria, demanding an official apology from the Ministry of Interior regarding the injury of their fellow lawyer at the hands of police personnel. The lawyers were then arrested and accused of attempting to break into the police station. An acquittal hearing for El-Masry and her colleagues was made in December 2015 but was unsuccessful. She has been declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Awards In June 2014, El-Masry was awarded the Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize, an international honour given annually to a lawyer for contributions to the defence of human rights. She was the second person to be awarded the international award while in prison since Nelson Mandela in 1985.

For each truth, they describe four characteristics. Tibetan tradition The Tibetan tradition emphasizes the study of the sixteen characteristics of the Four Noble Truths, as described in the Abhisamayalamkara. The Mahayana text Ornament of Clear Realization (Abhisamayalamkara) identifies four characteristics of each truth, for a total of sixteen characteristics, which are presented as a guide to contemplating and practicing the four noble truths. The Ornament of Clear Realization is a key text in the curriculum of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and study colleges, and this method of study and practice is emphasized in the Tibetan tradition. Description These sixteen characteristics are identified as follows:The Sixteen Aspects of the Four Noble Truths =Truth of suffering= These characteristics refer to the five aggregates #impermanence - the five aggregates are impermanent and change from moment to moment #suffering - the five aggregates have come into being because of avidya (ignorance) and kleshas (disturbing emotions), and they are under the influence of the avidya and kleshas #emptiness - there is no \\"self\\" outside of the five aggregates that controls or makes use of the five aggregates #selflessness - there is no \\"self\\" to be found within the five aggregates that controls or makes use of the five aggregates =Truth of origin= These characteristics refer to karma, kleshas, and avidya (ignorance) #causes - karma, kleshas, and avidya are constantly arising within our mental continuum, and because of their nature they have the quality of being the causes of suffering. #origin - kleshas and karma are the actual origin of suffering, not just intermediate links. #strong production - avidya, kleshas, and karma act forcefully as the main causes of suffering (they are not just passive ingredients) #condition - avidya, kleshas, and karma are more than just the main causes of suffering, they are also the contributory causes =Truth of cessation= These characteristics refer to cessation #cessation - cessation is the ceasing of all kleshas and avidya forever #pacification - cessation pacifies the torment of suffering, brings true peace #being superb - cessation is supreme in bringing about the source of all health and happiness #definite emergence - cessation will definitely bring us out of samsara =Truth of the path= These characteristics refer to the path #path - the path leads to cessation #awareness - the path leads us to a full and complete understanding of the root of cyclic existence (samsara) and the means to escape it #achievement - through the path, we can definitely achieve the result of liberation and enlightenment #deliverance - the path delivers us from the bondage of our conditioned existence References Sources Category:Buddhist belief and doctrine Category:Tibetan Buddhism ","title":"Sixteen characteristics"},{"id":"44542484","text":"The Whirlwind is a 1933 American Pre-Code Western film directed by D.

Melloul has always been convinced that the American audience is deeply interested by the Middle East news and much larger, which opens perspectives of development Melloul appointed Robert Wheelock (ex-ABC), David Shuster (ex-MSNBC), and Dan Raviv (ex-CBS) as part of this new American team. In 2017, the channel was nominated in the news category of Global Prizes of the Emmy International award and EutelSat TV Awards Four years after the launch of i24NEWS, Melloul i24NEWS CEO fought for the channel to be broadcast in Israel. According to the Israeli law, news broadcasts can be aired on cable or satellite, but only by an independent news producer. Thus, the owners of the broadcast medium cannot also own the news media. For Melloul, there was a paradox that i24NEWS was not broadcast in Israel, and there was a fundamental misunderstanding in this designation, and it is possible that its source is in the fact that this channel is a new hybrid which had yet to be seen in the industry on one hand, most of the journalists are broadcasting from Israel; on the other hand, the channel‚Äôs content is directed to a global audience. In absurd fashion, as things stand today, the channel broadcasts to many countries all over the world, to more than one billion households, and the only place in which it cannot be aired is Israel. The Israeli legislation finally approved Melloul's request in May 2017. Melloul says it is a double satisfaction. First this law project had a consensus among the Knesset and received the support of the whole political spectrum. Second, the legislation acknowledged the professionalism of the channel and its influence on a global scale. MK Nachman Shai, the initiator of the law, said once the bill was passed: \\"Today, we have bridged a gap that has been particularly prominent for foreign-language speakers with regard to Israeli television broadcasts, most of which deal with Israeli affairs. Channel i24news has proven over the years that it meets professional standards, serving a wide audience outside the borders of Israel and now also within Israel In August 2018, i24NEWS began to broadcast in Israel on HOT, in English, French and Arabic. Working with 300 employees worldwide, i24News broadcast from studios in Tel Aviv, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to over 1 billion households during 2019.

It was last used for horse racing in 1891. The grandstand, believed to have been designed by John Carr, is now the oldest surviving stone-built public grandstand in the world. History The former racecourse is located to the north-west of Richmond town on Low Moor ( a name it was sometimes referred to as), and its elevation is . The grandstand was paid for by public subscription, being erected in 1775, and it is believed to be the work of architect John Carr, who also designed the grandstands at Doncaster and York. The land at Low Moor was levelled \\"at great public expense\\". Horse-racing had been held in the environs of Richmond since at least 1576 (usually on High Moor), and by 1765, had moved to Low Moor, though racing had been conducted at Gatherley in 1516 (Gatherley is to the east of the town). A law was passed in 1740 by George II that races must not be run for a prize less than ¬£50. This had been to prevent the lower classes engaging in horse-racing (they were accused of \\"Idleness\\"). The same law dictated that horse races were to start and finish on the same day. As a result of this, Richmond racecourse stopped its races, but they were revived in 1760. Between 1765 and the building of the main grandstand in 1775, a temporary wooden stand was erected each year, the impetus for a more permanent structure came about due to the course holding the Hambleton Hundred Guineas Race. Besides the main grandstand, a private stand was built in 1814 for the Zetland family. The track was in a rough oval shape and ran for a distance of with the grandstand in the middle at the west end, which afforded the spectators views of the race without them losing sight of the jockeys. Races were run in a clockwise direction. The site last hosted races in August 1891; the Jockey Club had decided that one of the turns on the course was too tight for the modern thoroughbred horses. Additionally, the nearby course at Catterick was nearer to both the main roads and railways in the region. The grandstand had its lead roof stripped in the 1950s and further demolition occurred in the late 1960s. Horses are still run and trained on the gallops by local owners, although the site is criss-crossed by public footpaths. The grandstand building, which is now a grade II* listed structure, is the oldest stone-built public grandstand in the world. Due to the grandstand's condition, it has appeared on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register in 2019.

Shamberg (October 27, 1952Shamberg Michael H. Retrieved 2014-11-29. ‚Äì November 1, 2014) was an American music video producer and filmmaker known for his work with the British band, New Order. Shamberg, who was closely associated with Factory Records and New Order throughout his career, was responsible for producing some of the band's best known music videos, including ‚ÄúTrue Faith‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Monday‚Äù. Shamberg's producing credits included the 1987 music video for ‚ÄúTrue Faith‚Äù, which was nominated for \\"Best Music Video\\" at the 1988 Brit Awards. Shamberg also worked on music videos featuring numerous other musical artists, including Talking Heads, The B-52's, R.E.M., Patti Smith and Grace Jones. His music video production credits included videos directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Jonathan Demme, Robert Frank, Robert Longo, and William Wegman. Shamberg made his feature film debut with Souvenir, a 74-minute film released in 1999. The film, which took five years to create, included Stanton Miranda, Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina Ricci, Adam Hann-Byrd and Melvil Poupaud in the cast. Biography and career Shamberg was born in New York City in 1952 and moved to the Baltimore metropolitan area with his family when he was 2-months old. He was raised in Pikesville, Maryland, in suburban Baltimore. He studied at both Villanova University and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He moved to New York City during the mid-1970s after completing his studies. Shamberg professional relationship with New Order began in 1981, when he filmed one of their concerts in New York City. He eventually produced many of New Order's best-known music videos, as well as directing some of their earliest videos. For the surreal 1987 music video for True Faith, Shamberg and director, Philippe Decoufl√©, utilized performance artists. Another Shamberg music video, Blue Monday, features a dog balanced on tennis balls. He explained his work with New Order in a 2006 interview, saying \\"Making videos was not a routine of Factory, but something fun and interesting to do.\\" He remained close to the members of New Order after hiatuses in 1993 and 2007. Shamberg was also the founder and former head of Factory Records U.S. Shamberg released Souvenir, his first and only feature film, in 1999, shortly before his illness. The film, which took five years to create, included Stanton Miranda, Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina Ricci, Adam Hann-Byrd and Melvil Poupaud in the cast. Shamberg collaborated with director James Herbert, as well as Why Not Productions and Open City Films, on the production. The film focuses on an American sportswriter (Stanton Miranda) living in Paris who is consumed with childhood traumas and the death of her brother, Charles (Melvil Poupaud). In Souvenir, Shamberg ignored traditional film structures, favoring fades to black or sequences of still photographs. Indiewire called Souvenir, \\"a feast for the senses\\" that \\"deserves a look by anyone interested in seeing how far the film medium can go\\", while the Washington Post wrote that the film was \\"intentionally choppy.\\" Ann Hornaday, then a film critic with the Baltimore Sun called Souvenir a \\"really beautifully filmed, very poetic, very intuitive. ‚Ä¶ It left a lot of questions, and I like that.\\" Souvenir remains little known and is rarely viewed in public. It played at the first Maryland Film Festival in 1999. Shamberg also created a short film, Tribeca, which explores the post-punk band, A Certain Ratio. Shamberg was diagnosed with a progressive neurological disease during the early 2000s. He had lived in Paris, but returned to the Baltimore area in the mid-2000s as his illness progressed. In 2011, New Order performed several benefit concerts to cover the costs of Shamberg's medical treatment. By 2005, Shamberg was already in declining health and finding it difficult to continue day-to-day work. However, he remained committed to the promotion of art and the fostering of the arts. In 2005, Shamberg established the first of a group of centers he called \\"Turtle Salons,\\" opening the first at the Chelsea Space in London. Shamberg envisioned the salons as centers where both established and emerging artists could display their creations. He called the spaces \\"Turtle Salons\\" after a protected stretch of Mediterranean coastline along the border of Israel and Lebanon which had become a haven for endangered sea turtles. Shamberg had visited the area prior to his illness. The Turtle Salons soon became places where artists and other people within the creative industries would meet to collaborate on projects and designs. New salons were expanded to locations in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States. Michael Shamberg died from a long illness on November 1, 2014, at the age of 62. Former New Order bassist Peter Hook paid tribute to him saying, \\"Michael was a lovely man. His work on our videos, so important at the time, defined our image and an era. He was a true revolutionary. One of a very small band of truly gifted individuals! He will be missed.\\" New Order released a statement on Shamberg's death on their web site, \\"We are very sad to learn that our friend and colleague Michael H. Shamberg passed away on Saturday 1st November after a long illness...Michael was the founder of Factory US and New Order‚Äôs video producer, alongside his own work as filmmaker, teacher and director of Turtle Salon...His video production of \\"True Faith\\" earned \\"Best Music Video\\" at the Brit Awards 1988.

In 2004 Yad Vashem recognized him as a ‚ÄúRighteous among the Nations‚Äù for saving five members of the Almagi√† and extended family (Clotilde and Gina Almagi√†, Luciana Tedesco, Claudio Tedesco, Gabriella Ajo). Borromeo had been a student and assistant of Marco Almaj√†, a highly respected professor of physiopathology at the University of Rome.  Early life  Giovanni Borromeo was the son of the well known physician, Pietro Borromeo. While studying medicine at the University of Rome, he was drafted in World War I. Upon his return he earned a bronze medal. At age 22, Borromeo received his degree in medicine. According to his son, in 1931 he was appointed director of the \\"Ospedali Riuniti di Roma\\" but was banned from accepting the position because he was not a member of the Fascist Party. This claim has never been substantiated by evidence. On December 2, 1933, Borromeo married Maria Adelaide Mangani. They had 3 children: Beatrice (1934), Pietro (1937) and Maria Cristina (1943).  Career  In 1934, he was appointed director of the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli on the Tiberina Island downtown Rome. He and Prior Maurizio Bialek, continued the renovation that the hospital had begun in 1922 transforming an old medical hospice into a modern and efficient infrastructure. The Fatebenefratelli was considered an extraterritorial zone, since it belonged to the Hospitaller Order of Saint John of God that had purchased it in 1892 from the Kingdom of Italy and made it part of its worldwide chain of hospitals. Among the medical staff were two young doctors with a precarious position, Vittorio Emanuele Sacerdoti and Adriano Ossicini: they left the only known first hand recollections of life at the hospital during the war. Sacerdoti was Jewish and the nephew of Prof. Almagi√†, Borromeo's teacher. Ossicini was a Catholic antifascist who had eluded prison several times. In 1998 Sacerdoti gave a long interview at the Shoah Foundation and in 2005 Ossicini wrote a memoir entitled Un'isola sul Tevere (an island on the Tiber). Through their memories we learn that, after the armistice of September 8, 1943, during the Nazi occupation of Rome, the Fatebenefratelli became a crucible of fugitives, carabinieri, colonial police, deserters, resistance fighters, antifascists, and eventually, after the liberation, also republican fascists. Both Ossicini and Sacerdoti indicate that, after the armed clashes of September 8, 1943, a group of physicians at the hospital secretly organized to offer medical assistance to resistance fighters. Sacerdoti states that, because he was \\"in danger\\" anyway, he was often sent to the woods around Rome to tend to wounded partisans. Above all, Sacerdoti recounts that he provided care and, when available, medicines, to many Jews living in the old ghetto, across the street from the hospital. On September 8, 1943, after the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile between Italy and the Allies, the King and the Army abandoned Rome. Mussolini was liberated by his German allies and established the Italian Social Republic (RSI) whose territory extended from south of Naples to the Alps. The army received no precise orders and many of its commanders followed Pietro Badoglio and the King. Rome fell under German control headed by Herbert Kappler. Prefect Pietro Caruso took on the RSI administration who provided Kappler with infrastructure, manpower and information. Besides the German SS, fascist militia and collaborators were everywhere. The city suffered a severe shortage of food. After the round up of 1,200 Jews on October 16th, 1943, during the 9 months of occupation, more than 1,000 Jews were denounced and arrested, and transported to the concentration camp of Fossoli di Carpi and then to Auschwitz. According to Sacerdoti's deposition at the Shoah Foundation, at the Fatebenefratelli there were two occurrences of aid to Jews. Both Ossicini and Sacerdoti state that a small group of Jews was admitted with a diagnosis of Koch disease,\\"Koch disease,\\" was the name in use for \\"tuberculosis\\" which, between 1941 and 1945, became widespread all over Europe. In Rome alone mortality due to Koch disease doubled during the war years. which was quite common in those days. Doctors also internally referred to the fugitive \\"Koch\\" patients using the code-letter \\"K\\". According to Sacerdoti this was merely and internal code to indicate those who should stay separate. Ossicini attributes the idea of the K codeword to Sacerdoti. Sacerdoti however, remembered it as no more than an anecdote and when asked to identify the source of the codeword, responded: \\"I don't know, it was something people said\\" Sacerdoti did not give much significance to the codeword . However, a few years after Sacerdoti's death, Borromeo's son presented the anecdote as if it was something his father produced in large scale with false medical reports to keep the Germans away. No evidence has been found that such medical report were produced. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Germans ever entered the hospital that was located in Vatican territory. Ossicini's and Sacerdoti's recollection concerning the episode of aid to the Jews differ substantially insofar as dates, number of people and course of events. Both differ from Borromeo's son's book about his father's rescue of the Jews, which was written in 2007, thus many years after the others. Sacerdoti and Ossicini credit Borromeo for his humanity. Borromeo's participation in the resistance has not been the subject of studies and his name does not appear in any major historiographical account. According to Ossicini, he had always been suspicious of the Catholic alliance with the fascist regime and, at the time of the German occupation, leaned towards the resistance, although he never actively took part in it. According to Borromeo's son, together with Prior Bialek, Borromeo kept a radio in the basement of the hospital to keep contacts with the partisans, especially with his close friend Roberto Lordi. No other account of this fact has ever been published. In his interview, Sacerdoti suggested that, in general, the doctors at Fatebenefratelli kept away from politics. He mentioned Borromeo by name only once defining him \\"a very Catholic man\\". Borromeo had in fact close ties to the Vatican. After the war, he became friends with Alcide De Gasperi, also an antifascist with strong connections in the Vatican who was Prime Minister between 1945 and 1953. As a member of the Christian Democratic Party, he became Counselor for public health of the Municipality of Rome. Borromeo died at the Fatebenefratelli hospital in August 1961. After the war he was awarded a silver Medal of Civil Valor and, forty-three years after his death, he was recognized ‚ÄúRighteous among the Nations‚Äù by Yad Vashem for protecting the family of his mentor, Marco Almaj√†.  Vittorio Sacerdoti and Adriano Ossicini  Vittorio Sacerdoti was a young physician who had lost his position at the Ancona hospital following the Racial Laws. His uncle Marco Alamgi√† recommended him to his former student, Giovanni Borromeo. In 1941, facing a shortage of doctors, Borromeo called Sacerdoti and gave him a position. Within a few days Sacerdoti was reported to the police and dismissed. According to Sacerdoti, a young policeman took pity on him and suggested he remain at the hospital as a student practitioner, which, considering that the hospital was outside of the jurisdiction of Italy, would be tolerated. As time went by, through another influential uncle, Elio Ottolenghi, Sacerdoti was able to pay for false papers and worked under the name of Vittorio Salviucci. He continued to work at the hospital until after the liberation of Rome on June 4, 1944. In his recollection, Sacerdoti states that after September 8, 1943 some doctors at the hospital secretly and routinely offered their services to the resistance. He does not mention who was part of the group but makes clear that as the Axis' defeat became imminent, the clergy and staff at the hospital increasingly demonstrated tolerance for the efforts against the Germans. Adriano Ossicini was a psychiatrist and an antifascist who had been imprisoned several times. His close ties to the Vatican however, had eventually kept him out of jail. He belonged to the Catholic Resistance Movement and, although he could no longer work officially, maintained a semi-clandestine base at the Fatebenefratelli as a volunteer physician. From Ossicini's memoir it remains unclear how steady his presence at the hospital was, especially since, after September 8, his participation in the resistance fight intensified and his position became more tenuous. Late in life he stated that he took active part in letting Jews in the hospital on October 16th, 1943. This information is in conflict with both Sacerdoti's deposition at the Shoah Foundation and Ossicini's own memoir where it appears that he may not have been in Rome at the time of the round up of the Jews. Ossicini became part of the CNL (National Liberation Committee) and worked in the transition government led by Ferrucci Parri. In the postwar years he became known as an innovative psychiatrist and a leading figure in the Christian Democratic left.  Sources concerning the rescue of Jews  Sources concerning the aid to Jews at the Fatebenefratelli present some discrepancies. Pietro Borromeo's 2007 book and Gordon Thomas' divulgative 2012 apologetic book on Pius XII's silence claim that Borromeo had planned the rescue of Jews and devised a non-existent syndrome (the K syndrome) to keep them safely as patients in disguise. This version of the story places the events in the weeks preceding the round up of October 16. Contrary to this thesis, both Sacerdoti and Ossicini date the episode concerning the Jews as October 16, 1943. Sacerdoti states that 27 Jews, who were his patients and knew they could trust him, sought him out for help. According to Sacerdoti's deposition he authorized their admission with the diagnosis of Koch disease and that Borromeo and the Prior \\"did not oppose his action\\". These patients remained at the hospital for few days and then were dismissed. Sacerdoti believed that many were subsequently denounced and arrested. Sacerdoti and Ossicini indicate that \\"K\\" was only an internal code- word to indicate all fugitive Koch patients, not exclusively Jewish. The evidence that led Yad Vashem to the recognition is consistent with this second version. In is article \\"October 16th, 1943\\", Ossicini cites a specific episode and connects it with Borromeo's actions: \\"I remember the heart-wrenching cry of a mother at Reginella Street. She yelled to her small son: ‚ÄòRun, 'bello di mamma', run away!‚Äô. This admission of Jews as if they were patients became more frequent, with the help of the courageous professor Giovanni Borromeo. For this action, he then received a solemn recognition from the State of Israel\\". In his deposition 10 years earlier at the Shoah Foundation, Sacerdoti had narrated an identical episode he witnessed when he got up at dawn for the morning rounds (the hospital overlooks the Jewish quarter). Sacerdoti circumscribed the admission of Jews to the October 16th event and Borromeo's aid to members of the Almagi√†-Aj√≤ family who in fact provided the only testimonies from beneficiaries of Borromeo's actions. It is possible that Ossicini, who also stated in the book that he was in hiding and could not remain at the hospital during the occupation, did not witness the October 16th event directly but mixed his own memories of the time with a story he had heard from Sacerdoti. Pietro Borromeo and Gordon Thomas attribute to Giovanni Borromeo the invention of a non-existent disease (the K Disease) that would have allowed him to admit hundreds of Jewish patients. Their version of the facts focuses only on Jewish rescue ignoring completely the broader situation narrated by Sacerdoti and Ossicini.  Film  Giovanni Borromeo's story has recently become the topic of a film, \\"My Italian Secret,\\" which the Italy and the Holocaust Foundation commissioned to documentary maker Oren Jacoby.The Foundation, whose mission is to \\"share the little known story of the role of Italy in the rescue of the Jews\\", has among its supporters Pave the Way and is financed by Italian American magnates including Kenneth Langone and Joseph Perella who serves as its president. \\"My Italian Secret\\" embraces Pietro Borromeo's and Gordon Thomas' version of the story and focuses only on the anecdotes of the non-existent disease without any reference to other historical references. The foundation's president Joseph Perella had initially announced the film as a tribute to Giovanni Palatucci. Following the publication of the data on Palatucci's work as an employee under the fascist regime, the Italian Social Republic and the Germans, the film's protagonists remained Giovanni Borromeo and Gino Bartali.

First version. Private collection. One of the works sold by Angerer for G√∂ring. Josef \\"Sepp\\" Angerer (1899‚Äì1961) was a rug merchant and art dealer who acted as an agent for Hermann G√∂ring's private art collection, immediately before and during the Second World War. Art that Angerer dealt with for G√∂ring came from a variety of sources: looted, acquired using threats, bought on the open market, and appropriated from museums.  Background  Angerer was director of Quantmeyer & Eicke, of Kronenstrasse 61, Berlin, importers of rugs, furniture and works of art. In art matters he was second only to Walter Hofer in importance to G√∂ring. Angerer used his international contacts to find art for the G√∂ring collection and arranged the sale of the modern works that G√∂ring did not want, thus raising funds to buy the tapestries and old master works that G√∂ring preferred. Although he had strong Nazi connections, Angerer held no official position within the Nazi state.Petropoulos, 1996, p. 142.  \\"Degenerate art\\"  The Nazis regarded any art that did not fit with their ideas of what art should be as Degenerate art. Almost all modern art was regarded as \\"degenerate\\".

Koenig died in 1941 when he fell under a train at Cologne station. According to Ivan Lindsay, Koenig was killed by the Nazis, so his collection of old master drawings could be taken from him. Of the remaining paintings, one by Edvard Munch and one by Paul Signac were sold by Angerer in Sweden and two further Munchs in London. G√∂ring paid compensation to the St√§del Museum for the Van Gogh and the Folkwang Museum for the C√©zanne but at a fraction of the paintings true worth.  Gifts for Hitler  G√∂ring in captivity 9 May 1945 Top Nazis liked to give each other gifts of art. When G√∂ring desired to give Adolf Hitler a gift, he asked Angerer to buy eight Flemish tapestries from Albert Auwercx's series of \\"Gothic Myths\\", as the Nazis called these allegorical subjects. G√∂ring's own deals could be mixed into such transactions in order to disguise them.Petropoulos, 1996, pp. 79-80.  Activities in Italy  Angerer was asked by G√∂ring to buy six tapestries in Italy for 400,000 Lire. He took a dozen to G√∂ring in Berlin in August 1941 of which G√∂ring bought six. On a trip to Florence, around 1942, Angerer and the local German consul Gerhard Wolf went on a tour of Count Bonacossi's collection. Angerer supposedly told the count, \\"What a pity you're not a Jew!\\" and drawing a finger across his throat continued \\"If you were a Jew, we could do just that! And all the paintings would be ours!\\" Forewarned of a German art raid, local collections had already removed their best items and hidden them elsewhere behind false walls. Records had been falsified and the remaining works spaced out to disguise the absences. Enquirers after the Jewish art historian Bernard Berenson's collection were told that he had fled to Portugal with the help of the Vatican and that nothing of importance remained in Florence. In fact, he was still in Italy, awaiting the Allied liberation.  Post war  Angerer was interrogated by the Allies in the Autumn of 1945. He was placed under arrest and his home at Berchtesgaden, which he had shared with Fritz G√∂rnnert (G√∂ring's personal assistant), was searched.Angerer had occupied the ground floor and G√∂rnnert and his wife the two upper storeys. Thomas Carr Howe Jr., one of the U.S. \\"monuments men\\" charged with recovering looted art, described what he found there: \\"The house was an unpretentious villa hidden among pine trees high up in the hills above the town. The place was under guard. On the ground floor we examined the contents of a small storeroom. There were several cases bearing Angerer's name and three or four large crates containing Italian furniture. A similar storeroom on the second floor contained a dozen tapestries, a pile of Oriental rugs, a large collection of church vestments and nearly a hundred rare textiles mounted on cardboard. ‚Ä¶ Concealed beneath the tapestries were ten cases, each one about two feet square and a foot high... On each one was stenciled in Gothic letters: \\"Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring.\\" They contained a magnificent collection of Oriental weapons.\\"Howe Jr, Thomas Carr.

In ancient times inhabited the south-central plains of Santiago del Estero and the current city. Limited to the north by the lules, south by the sanavirones, west to the diaguitas and east by the Salado River. The houses were built on artificial mounds forming elevation, were round and made with slightly durable material and thatch. Enclosed their villages with palisades. The annual flooding of the Dulce and Salado rivers were used to irrigate their crops of corn, quinoa, beans and squash. Raised llamas and ostriches.

Enkrateia (Greek , \\"in power - from ·ºêŒΩ (en, ‚Äúin‚Äù) + Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ (kr√°tos, ‚Äúpower‚Äù). Enkrateia comes from the adjective enkrat√™s (·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒÆœÇ from ·ºêŒΩ (en, ‚Äúin‚Äù) which means possession, power over something or someone else + Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ (kr√°tos, ‚Äúpower‚Äù)). It results in the meaning of power over yourself, power over your own passions and instincts, self-control and self-mastery. During Socrates' life three of his disciples, Isocrates, Xenophon and Plato, transformed the adjective enkrat√™s to the noun enkrateia and gave it a different meaning: with them, enkrateia meant not power over something or someone else but power over yourself, power over your own passions and instincts, self-control.Jaeger, W.

A descendant of the outstanding broodmare Take Charge Lady, she was one of the leading juvenile fillies in North America in 2014. After winning only one of her first five races she sprang a 66/1 upset when winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and followed up with victories in the Delta Princess Stakes and the Grade I Starlet Stakes. After winning a listed stakes race early in 2015, a bone chip in her knee, discovered prior to her anticipated start in the Rebel Stakes, took her out of contention for the Kentucky Oaks. Returning to the track in August 2015, following two lackluster performances, she was retired in September, 2015. Background Take Charge Brandi is a chestnut filly with a broad white blaze bred in Kentucky by the Charming Syndicate. She was sired by Giant's Causeway who won six Group One races in Europe and was named Cartier Horse of the Year in 2000. His other progeny include Ghanaati, Footstepsinthesand, Shamardal, Rite of Passage and Aragorn. He was Leading sire in North America in 2009, 2010 and 2012. Take Charge Brandi's dam Charming, was the first foal of Take Charge Lady who has also produced the Grade I winners Take Charge Indy and Will Take Charge. Trained by Todd Pletcher Charming won on her debut at Keeneland, but sustained a serious injury at Monmouth Park in July and was retired from racing. Take Charge Brandi is her second foal. As a yearling Take Charge Brandi was consigned to the Keeneland September sale, where she was bought for $435,000 by Willis Horton. The filly was sent into training with the veteran D. Wayne Lukas. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Take Charge Brandi made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over four and a half furlongs at Churchill Downs on June 22. Ridden by Corey Lanerie she took the lead soon after the start and drew away in the closing stages to win \\"very easily\\" by two and a half lengths from Conquest Archangel. Four weeks later, the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Grade III Schuylerville Stakes over six furlongs at Saratoga Race Course and finished second to the odds-on favorite Fashion Alert. Take Charge Brandi was unplaced in her next three races. She finished fifth to Cavorting in the Adirondack Stakes at Saratoga, fifth again behind Cristina's Journey in the Pocahontas Stakes at Churchill Downs and eighth behind the British-trained Peace And War in the Grade I Alcibiades Stakes at Keeneland. Take Charge Brandi was then sent to California to contest the thirty-first running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over one and one sixteenth of a mile at Santa Anita Park on November 1. Ridden for the first time by Victor Espinoza she started the 66/1 outsider of the twelve runner field. The Chandelier Stakes winner Angela Renee started as the favorite ahead of Conquest Eclipse, Puca, Cristina's Journey and Top Decile. Espinoza sent his mount into the lead soon after the start and set the pace from By The Moon, Feathered and Hennythelovepenny. She maintained her advantage into the straight with Feathered, Wonder Gal and Danette as her closest pursuers and many of the more fancied fillies beginning to struggle. Espinoza never had to resort to using his whip as Take Charge Brandi kept on in the closing stages to win by half a length from the fast-finishing Top Decile, with Wonder Gal, Feathered and Danette close behind in third, fourth and fifth. After the race Espinoza said \\"Wayne just told me to let her run and I did that. I hit her once and she didn't seem to like it, so I didn't hit her anymore and I just let her do her thing.\\" Lukas commented \\"I thought she had a great week, and today I thought we could be a factor, not that we would win it, but that we would do very sell. This is the most exciting one yet\\". Three weeks after her Breeders' Cup, Take Charge Brandi started the 2.2/1 favorite under top weight of 122 pounds for the Grade III Delta Princess Stakes at Delta Downs. Ridden for the first time by Paco Lopez, the favorite tracked the early leader Vivian Da Bling before gaining the advantage on the final turn. In the stretch she held off the challenge of Skipalute to win by one and a half lengths, with Majestic Presence a length away in third. Lukas said that the winner \\"showed her class today because I didn't think she handled the track very well\\". On December 13, she returned to California to contest the Grade I Starlet Stakes, held for the first time at Los Alamitos Race Course. With Espinoza back in the irons, she went off as the favorite. Leading wire to wire, but strongly challenged in the stretch, she defeated the Todd Pletcher- trained Feathered by half a length as well as third-place finisher Maybellene and familiar rival Majestic Presence in fourth. Espinoza said, \\"...It seemed like when she felt them coming, she dug in and wasn't going to let them by.\\" Lukas explained that the dramatic improvement from her lackluster summer performances was because \\"we decided just to leave her alone and let her run her race.\\" =2015: three-year-old season= Take Charge Brandi made her three-year-old debut with a close victory over Sarah Sis in Oaklawn Park's Martha Washington Stakes. It was then decided by Take Charge Brandi's connections to try running her against males in the March 14th Rebel Stakes in the hopes of possibly competing in the Kentucky Derby instead of the Kentucky Oaks, but five days before the Rebel she was discovered to have a non- displaced bone chip in her right knee. The injury was expected to sideline the horse for two months, taking her out of Derby and Oaks contention. The filly eventually returned in the Test Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on August 8. Ridden by Luis Saez, she led the field into the straight before tiring in the closing stages and was eased down to finish last of the ten runners behind Cavorting. Following the September 19 Cotillion Stakes, where she was eased and did not finish, her connections announced her retirement on September 28.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/94756/champion-take-charge- brandi-retired On November 3, Take Charge Brandi was sold for $6 million at the Keeneland breeding stock sale to Hill 'n' Dale Farm.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/95749/take-charge-brandi- tops-at-keeneland-for-6m Pedigree References Category:2012 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 22-c Category:Eclipse Award winners Category:Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winners ","title":"Take Charge Brandi"},{"id":"44542948","text":"Harkham may refer to: People *Efrem Harkham, Israeli-born American hotelier from Los Angeles, California. *Sammy Harkham (born 1980), American cartoonist from Los Angeles, California. *Uri Harkham, American businessman from Los Angeles, California.

Available at: http://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/quakerstudies/vol3/iss2/1 She married John Audland and they were both preachers for the Quaker cause from their conversion in 1652. Anne travelled throughout Yorkshire. Oxfordshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire advocating the views of George Fox. In 1653 she was put on trial for her blasphemy but argued that this was incorrect and she published her views in A True Declaration of the Suffering of the Innocent, two years later. Anne travelled without her husbandCaroline L. Leachman, ‚ÄòCamm , Anne (1627‚Äì1705)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 November 2014 so that she could avoid the distraction of pregnancies that might interfere with her work. In 1664 she gave birth to a son a fortnight after the death of her first husband. After this she married Thomas Camm despite being over a decade older than him. They had two daughters and Anne supported her husband in his preaching rather than preaching herself. She had to run the household whilst he was imprisoned for his beliefs. Anne's reduction in her preaching is thought to mirror the changing role of women within the Quakers.

It is the most North Western of the features of the Spratly Islands, located to the NW of Dangerous Ground. The reef is a large (8.5 nautical miles) approximately circular atoll with a central lagoon (~20m deep). The surrounding reef is shallow.  History  Chiem Thanh fishermen are probably the first people to discover this North Danger Reef. However, it is the Vietnamese who show their presence often here. From the 15th century onward, Vietnamese kings began to pay attention to the islands in the South China sea. In 1776, Le Quy Don wrote at Phu Bien Tap Luc about these islands, as well as the establishment and operation of the Paracel fleet (Vietnamese: H·∫£i ƒê·ªôi Ho√†ng Sa) and the Northern fleet (Vietnamese: H·∫£i ƒê·ªôi B·∫Øc H·∫£i) of Vietnam. In 1838, Emperor Minh Mang (Vietnam) allowed to measure and draw a map of this sea area. It is called the \\"Dai Nam Nhat Thong Toan Do\\", in which it clearly shows the Spratly and Paracel Islands of Vietnam. When Vietnam was a French colony, the French Government continued to manage North Danger Reef on behalf of Vietnam along with the Paracel and Spratly Islands. In 1904, the Qing Dynasty (China) measured and published a map of China's provinces (Chinese: ÁöáÊúùÁõ¥ÁúÅÂú∞ËàÜÂÖ®Âõæ). This map clearly shows that the southernmost territory of China is Hainan Island, without Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands. In 1935, China announced its claims and named the North Danger Reef. It is called: \\"Gemini\\" (Chinese: ÂèåÂ≠êÁæ§Á§Å).

In 1954, the French government officially returned North Danger Reef with the entire Spratly and Paracel Islands to the Republic of Vietnam. In 1958, the Republic of Vietnam Navy built milestones of sovereignty on Southwest Cay and Northeast Cay. In 1970, the Philippine Navy seized Southwest Cay of Vietnam.

It carried out this role during World War I, as well as forming field units that served on the Western Front and at Salonika. Before the outbreak of World War II it formed an air defence regiment that saw service during The Blitz and field companies that fought in the Western Desert and Italy, The unit continued in the postwar Territorial Army before finally disbanding in 1967. Early history The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many local Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. One of these was the 1st Hampshire Engineer Volunteer Corps (1st Hants EVC) based at Southampton. The first officers' commissions for the unit were issued on 25 January 1862. As a small, single company corps, it was attached for convenience to the 2nd Hampshire Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVC) in 1863, and both came under the 4th Administrative Battalion of Hampshire Rifle Volunteers in 1865.Beckett, Appendix IX.Monthly Army ListsWestlake, pp. 9‚Äì10. In 1870, the unit was attached to the 2nd Tower Hamlets EVC in London rather than the local rifle units. Under the mobilisation scheme in force in 1880, the 1st Hants EVC formed part of the Garrison Army, assigned to defence of the important naval base of Portsmouth, along with detachments from EVCs as far away as Yorkshire, Lancashire and Northamptonshire. However, the 1st Hants EVC was disbanded in 1881 and the volunteers absorbed by the 2nd Hampshire RVC. Reformed unit A new 1st Hampshire Engineer Volunteers was formed at Portsmouth on 1 April 1891. This was a much larger unit, 481 men (mainly from Portsmouth Dockyard) volunteering for a unit with an official establishment of two companies totaling 100. The new unit included a cadet company at Weymouth until 1902, and the 1st Sussex Engineer Volunteers was attached to it for administrative purposes in 1892‚Äì95. The new corps rented and renovated the old drill hall of the 3rd Hampshire RVC, laid a parade ground, and practised digging field fortifications on Southsea Common. Non-Commissioned Officers from the corps took special courses on fortress engineering at the Royal Engineers' depot at Chatham.Hampshire Engineers at Victorian Forts The 1st Hampshire Royal Engineers (Volunteers) (as the unit was officially titled from 1896) sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War in 1900, and a second section the following year.Watson, pp. 42‚Äì3. Territorial Force RE Cap badge (King George V cipher) When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the 1st Hampshire RE (V) became the Hampshire (Fortresss) RE (TF), forming part of Southern Coast Defences. By the outbreak of war in August 1914, the unit had the following organisation:London Gazette 20 March 1908.Engineers at British Army 1914.Monthly Army List August 1914.Fortress Engineers at Long, Long Trail.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 13. * HQ at Portsmouth * No 1 Works Company at Commercial Road, Portsmouth * No 2 Works Company at Hampshire Terrace, Portsmouth * No 3 Works Company at Eastleigh * No 4 Electric Light (EL) Company at Hampshire Terrace, Portsmouth * No 5 EL Company at Freshwater, Isle of Wight * No 6 EL Company at Gosport Together with the Regular No 4 Company, RE, at Haslar Barracks in Gosport, the unit was responsible for the coastal defence searchlights in the Portsmouth area, including the Isle of Wight and the three sea forts at Spithead (Spitbank Fort, No Man's Land Fort and Horse Sand Fort). World War I Horse Sand Fort =Coast and Anti-Aircraft defence= On the outbreak of war, the Hampshire (Fortress) RE had a serious deficiency of personnel. On 5 August, it was supplemented by No 4 Company of the Tyne Electrical Engineers (TEE), which took over several of the coast defence searchlight stations around Portsmouth. Two other companies of the TEE moved into Haslar Barracks in Gosport and later took over from No 4 Co RE the running of the electric light training school. As the war progressed, the requirement for anti-aircraft searchlights (AA/SLs), as well as coast defence lights became vital, and the school at Haslar trained a large number of AA detachments for Home Defence and for service on the Western Front and other theatres of the war.Short et al., pp. 73‚Äì80, 86. By November 1915, the Hampshire unit's strength had grown to 39 officers and 604 other ranks, and it took back responsibility for the three sea forts, and then, in May 1916, it took over from the TEE two new searchlight stations, Egypt Point and Stone Point, at the entrance to the Solent.Short et al., pp. 78, 84. On 25 September 1916, the only air attack on Portsmouth during World War I occurred when Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Mathy commanding the Zeppelin L31 hovered over the harbour in the searchlight beams, without actually dropping any bombs. Shortly after this raid the Hampshire (Fortress) RE took over all the AA searchlights in Portsmouth Garrison, forming No 48 AA Company.Short et al., pp. 86, 141‚Äì3.Morris.Dockyard at War at Historic Dockyard In May 1918, the Portsmouth AA defences were included in the London Air Defence Area.Short et al., p. 151. =Expansion= Shortly after the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate companies were created, as well as additional 1st Line companies from the volunteers pouring into the recruiting stations.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. Despite the initial manpower shortages of the Hampshire (Fortress) RE, these are known to have been numbered as high as 1/8th Hampshire EL Company.RE Museum list of WWI unit war diaries. The Hampshire (Fortress) RE also formed a number of 'Army Troops' and 'Works' companies for service with the armies at home and overseas: * 1/1st Hampshire Fortress Company embarked for France on 19 January 1915.The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 162/7.

It was later termed an Army Troops Company and served on the Somme in 1916.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 69‚Äì70. When TA companies of the RE were numbered in February 1917 it became 559th (Hampshire) Army Troops Company.

The Hampshire (Fortress) RE also formed one field engineer company, from 1/7th Hampshire Army Troops Company. =Salonika campaign= The 1/7th Hampshire Field Company, (numbered 506th (Hampshire) Field Company in February 1917), embarked for France on 19 October 1915 and joined the 28th Division on 25 October as the division was embarking at Marseilles. The division arrived in Egypt by 22 November, and then re-embarked for the Macedonian front, completing disembarkation at Salonika by 4 January 1916.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 31, 61.Becke, pp. 105‚Äì14. Among the first tasks the newly arrived division had to carry out was construction of fieldworks across rough country, in winter, against the possibility of immediate Bulgarian attack: 'In the face of rain, snow, and the biting wind the infantry and engineers stuck to their task'.Wakefield & Moody, p. 34. Offensive operations were rare on the Macedonian front, but work to improve defences and roads was continuous, and the 28th Division in the Struma Valley suffered badly from malaria.Wakefield & Moody, p. 50. The largest operation in the Struma Valley was the capture by 28th Division of Karajakoi Bala, Karajakoi Zir and Yenikoi in October 1916. Defences of these villages then had to be consolidated. The outpost line consisted of a chain of these villages, trenched and wired, and garrisoned by infantry, machine gun teams and RE detachments.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 109‚Äì12. 28th Division took part in two further offensive operations in May and October 1917. Eventually, it participated in the Second Battle of Doiran beginning on 18 September 1918, which failed to break through the Bulgarian lines. However, the Bulgarians had been defeated elsewhere, and some days later the British realised that the entrenchments in front of them were empty. 28th Division then took part in the pursuit to the Strumica Valley (22‚Äì28 September).Wakefield & Moody, pp. 196‚Äì224. After the Armistice with Bulgaria came into effect on 30 September, British forces, including 28th Division, advanced across the country towards Turkey. With no troops to defend Constantinople from this direction, the Ottoman Empire also signed an Armistice on 30 October. 28th Division was sent to occupy the Dardanelles Forts. 506th (Hampshire) Field Company was still in Turkey in April 1919, but after that the TF units were progressively replaced by Regular and Indian Army units and the Territorials were demobilised and returned home.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 225‚Äì32. Interwar After the war, the Hampshire (Fortress) RE reformed in the Territorial Army (TA) with at least five companies. Once again it was assigned to defence of the South Coast of England, in 43rd Divisional Area. In 1922‚Äì23 the barracks at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight was converted into a headquarters for No 5 (EL) Company and part of '3rd (Hampshire) Field Company' (ie the 3rd (Wessex) Field Company raised in Portsmouth for the 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Engineers in 1914, which became 206th (Hampshire) Fd Co in the reformed TA).TNA Treasury file T 161/31/7.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 90, 99. However, by 1927, No 5 Company had disappeared and the unit had the following organisation:Titles & Designations. * No 1 (Works) Company * No 2 (Lights) Company * No 3 (Lights) Company * No 4 (Lights) Company Later, its organisation was:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 104. * HQ at Hampshire Terrace, Portsmouth * No 1 (AA/SL) Company at Hampshire Terrace * No 2 (AA/SL) Company at East Cowes * No 3 (EL) Company at RE Drill Hall, Haslar Road, Gosport * No 4 (EL & Works) Company at Hampshire Terrace In 1937, three companies were converted into a searchlight unit, 48th (Hampshire) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA), with the following organisation:Litchfield, p. 97.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 114. * HQ at Portsmouth * 391st Anti-Aircraft Company at Portsmouth * 392nd Anti-Aircraft Company at East Cowes, Isle of Wight * 393rd Anti-Aircraft Company at Gosport * 394th Anti-Aircraft Company at Southampton The following year, the battalion came under the command of 35th AA Brigade, based at Fareham, which formed part of 5th AA Division.Routledge Table LX, p. 378. The remainder of the Hampshire Fortress RE continued as a single Electric Light and Works company in the Portsmouth Coast Defences. In 1938, it was joined by 206th (Hampshire) Field Company from 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Engineers, which became No 2 (206th) (Electric Light and Works) Company.Watson & Runaldi, p. 186. World War II =Hampshire Fortress Engineers= In the early months of the war the unit was engaged in installing and testing anti-shipping and anti-aircraft searchlights, generating gear and general defensive works. Its average strength at this time was 27 officers and 440‚Äì460 other ranks.Hampshire Fortress Engineers War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 166/3548. At the end of April 1940 the unit was ordered to hand over its responsibilities to units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and reorganise as a corps engineer unit as follows:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 133.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 171. Hampshire Corps Troops RE (CTRE) * 576th Corps Field Park Company * 577th Army Field Company * 578th Army Field Company * 579th Army Field Company (formed from the Cinque Ports Fortress Royal Engineers based at Dover. By the end of 1940, Hampshire CTRE had been redesignated as IV CTRE, assigned to IV Corps. The Corps sailed for the Middle East in November 1941 and was established in Iraq by 1 February 1942. 579th Company was left in the UK and transferred to VIII CTRE in December 1941. On arrival in Iraq, IV CTRE was detached from Corps HQ and sent to Egypt to join Eighth Army (IV Corps later went on to India).Watson & Rinaldi, p. 131. =XIII Corps Troops RE= Western Desert In Egypt, the unit became XIII CTRE, assigned to XIII Corps in the Western Desert. In early 1941 all of XIII Corps' engineers were busy constructing the Gazala Line in an attempt to halt General Rommel's expected offensive. The attack came on 26 May and by 14 June XIII Corps' infantry divisions had been forced out of the Gazala Line. Tobruk fell soon afterwards and with Eighth Army in headlong retreat the engineers had to destroy or salvage all the water supply, port and railway equipment to deny them to the enemy. From 27 June all the corps' engineers were engaged in preparing a new defensive position at El Alamein.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 355‚Äì9. Rommel was successfully held at Alamein and on 23/24 October Eighth Army went over to the offensive under General Montgomery at the Second Battle of El Alamein. For this offensive 577th Company was temporarily attached to 44th (Home Counties) Division.Joslen, pp. 570‚Äì1.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII. p. 394. After the battle, XIII Corps was given the job of securing prisoners and clearing the battlefield, where the engineers had 'the unenviable task of sorting out the maze of minefields, lifting some and marking others'.Pakenham- Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 396.Playfair, Vol IV, p. 92. XIII Corps was mainly left in the rear areas for the rest of the North African Campaign.Playfair, Vol IV, p. 220. Sicily and Calabria XIII was given an assault role in the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), sailing from Egypt and landing in the south east of the island on 10 July 1943. For this operation XIII CTRE was joined by 56th Field Company, a Regular RE unit that had been serving with Tenth Army in Palestine; it remained with the unit for the rest of the war.Joslen, pp. 470‚Äì80. The troops advanced steadily, supported by the engineers building numerous bridges and repairing damaged supply routes through rugged country, and the island was in Allied hands by 17 August.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 5‚Äì8.Molony, Vol V, pp. 26, 113, 175. RE sappers complete a Bailey bridge to replace one blown by retreating Germans, Italy, September 1943. XIII was also entrusted with the assault landing in the 'toe' of mainland Italy on 2/3 September, Operation Baytown. This was almost unopposed, but there was considerable work for the engineers in repairing the port of Reggio and replacing the usual demolished bridges.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 13.Molony, Vol V, p. 223. Operation Diadem Eighth Army steadily advanced up Italy until it was held at the Germans' Winter Line and stalemate set it. The following Spring, XIII Corps participated in the fourth Battle of Monte Cassino (Operation Diadem) with an assault crossing of the Rapido River on the night of 11 May 1944. The subsequent advance was dependent upon bridges being quickly established across this river, and 577 Field Co was made responsible for building a Class 40 Bailey bridge codenamed 'London' at San Angelo on the front of 8th Indian Division. A camouflaged track (also codenamed 'London') was prepared to bring the bridging material close to the river by night. The bridging operation began after the Indian troops had seized their bridgehead, and went on under cover of a smokescreen, while 8th Indian Division cleared San Angelo. 'London' was completed by 577 Fd Co at 10.30 on 14 May, and two additional Class 40 bridges into 8th Indian Division's bridgehead ('Edenbridge' and 'Tonbridge') were completed by 56 Fd Co at 17.00 and 22.00 respectively. 78th Division, which had been waiting for 'London' to open, crossed the river on 14 May to join in the attack the following day.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 49‚Äì53.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 78‚Äì84, 107‚Äì9, 115‚Äì23. The Official History gives much of the credit for the success of 'Diadem' to the British and Indian engineers.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, p. 293. Bailey bridge constructed over the Arno in Florence by 577 Fd Co on 15 August 1944, using the piers of the original Ponte Santa Trinita bridge blown up by the Germans. This success was followed by a breakthrough of the Hitler Line, and an advance to Florence, where the Germans had destroyed the historic bridges. By late August 8 Indian Division had the task of crossing the River Arno where no peacetime road existed. During the nights of 25‚Äì27 August the divisional engineers constructed improvised crossings under fire, after which XIII CTRE completed a low-level Bailey bridge by the morning of 28 August. The advance then continued to the Gothic Line.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 63. Roadbuilding The autumn's fighting involved a huge amount of bridgebuilding and road improvement in rough terrain. Along Highway 67 from Florence to Forli, a section from Dicomano 'twisted and turned for six miles through a narrow cleft in the mountains, rising gently to San Godingo, whence it climbed nearly 3,000 feet in five miles to the Muraglione Pass'. The estimated time for re-opening this section was a month, but the sappers and gunners of 6th Armoured Division got it open in 13 days, after which XIII CTRE followed up and converted it into a two-way Class 40 road in 19 days. The most difficult sections were two demolitions of and respectively, which were widened, blasting away the rock face on one side and building up the other side on cribbing. The Corps engineers were assisted by 10th Mechanical Equipment Platoon, RE, a detachment of 1st Drilling Company, Royal Canadian Engineers, an anti-tank battery of the Royal Artillery, three-and-a-half companies of the Pioneer Corps, three general transport (GT) companies and two tipper platoons of the Royal Army Service Corps, and 70 Italian wood-cutters. Wood cut by the gunners and the Italians was turned into 'cribs' and 'dogs' by 576 Corps Field Park Co, which were then filled with rock quarried at Dicomano and rubble from ruined buildings.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 65‚Äì6.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 269. A Bailey bridge crosses a damaged bridge under repair in Italy. Once through the Gothic Line, XIII Corps took over part of the front from US forces, whose engineers had opened a track ('Ace') from San Pietro on Highway 65, over the Apennine Mountains into the valley of the Santerno. This involved steep diversions that caused great difficulties for British transport. On the evening of 4 October, 56 Fd Co was summoned from work on Highway 67 to eliminate one of these diversions by building a Bailey bridge over a demolished six-arch brick bridge at San Andrea. The company was given about 500 British and Italian Pioneers to assist. The accessible piers were rebuilt, those that were inaccessible were reached by cantilevering Bailey sections across to them. The tallest inaccessible pier had the top blown off by using 6-pounder and 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The whole procedure was delayed by heavy rain and some shelling, but the company completed the job by midday on 15 October.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 66‚Äì7.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 418. Maintaining routes such as 'Ace' during the winter months was a huge task, and XIII CTRE and 78th Division's RE had to be reinforced by US engineers when one section collapsed into mud.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 67‚Äì8. Advance to the Po XIII Corps spent the late winter of 1944‚Äì45 in the mountains above Bologna. Before the Allied Spring Offensive began, it was moved down to prepare to cross the River Po. 56 and 578 Field Companies were left behind to deal with the stocks of engineer equipment left in the mountains: they used it to build four Bailey bridges to repair the routes to bring stores down into the plain. They then rejoined XIII CTRE on 16 April. The whole weight of the corps' engineers was thrown into supporting the advance of 2nd New Zealand Division. XIII CTRE under its Commander, RE, (CRE) Lt-Col R.F. Hawker, was reinforced by two tipper platoons, two GT platoons and a composite platoon transporting rafts and assault boats, with three and a half Pioneer companies doing the loading and unloading. Two sets of Bailey equipment were delivered each day to 576 Fd Park Co, which kept two equipment dumps open, leapfrogging forward as the advance proceeded. The New Zealanders crossed the Sillaro on 14 April, and by dawn on 16 April three low-level Bailey bridges across it were completed. Between 16 and 20 April a number of canals were crossed, then on the night of 20/21st the New Zealanders made an assault crossing of the Idice. The following day XIII CTRE put over a high- level Bailey bridge, and the Po was reached on 23 April. Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 95‚Äì7. A Bailey pontoon bridge built over the Po, April 1945. Bridging the wide Po was a major operation, but XIII Corps had made such good progress that it was allotted material for its own pontoon Bailey bridge in a rushed operation. The site selected from aerial photographs was found to be unsuitable due to Allied bomb craters, and the alternative meant bridging a gap and all available Bailey material and transport had to be collected from other formations. 2nd New Zealand Division began its assault crossing on the night of 24/25 April, and the convoy of bridging equipment began to move forward at dawn, arriving on site at 17.00. The first lorries crossed by a light Folding Boat Equipment (FBE) bridge erected by the New Zealand RE, heavier equipment going over by the New Zealanders' Class 40 ferry. This meant that both ends of the pontoon bridge could be started together and despite communication problems it was completed by 17.00 on 27 April. Two hours later it was damaged by an underwater explosion ‚Äì whether by a floating mine or sabotage by frogmen was never ascertained ‚Äì but was quickly repaired by dismantling and incorporating one of the New Zealanders' ferries. This was completed by 02.00 on 28 April - the longest floating Bailey bridge built in the longest Italian campaign.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 97‚Äì8, 100‚Äì2, 118.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 316‚Äì8. The Po crossing was followed by a rapid advance to the Adige: bridging and supply were now the factors limiting the speed of advance. Engineer equipment was short but top priority was given to XIII Corps (the corps' chief engineer had a section of Military Police to escort his equipment through the traffic jams). This enabled XIII CTRE to throw a pontoon Bailey bridge across the fast-flowing Adige at Piacenza, which presented greater difficulties than the wide Po. Material arrived on site at 08.00 on 29 April and the bridge was completed by 22.00 on the same day, although work on the approaches prevented it being opened to traffic until next morning. XIII Corps now pursued the defeated Germans across the Venetian Plain to the Piave, which was reached on 29 April. The bridge had been wrecked by Allied bombers months before, but XIII CTRE arrived on 1 May with equipment to build a floating Bailey bridge. The German forces in Italy surrendered (the Surrender of Caserta) the following day, but XIII Corps continued advancing to Trieste as the war ended.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 102‚Äì6, 109.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 320, 324, 326, 328, 340. XIII CTRE was disbanded after September 1945. =48th (Hampshire) Searchlight Regiment, RA= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939, the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. The AA Battalions of the RE were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) on 1 August 1940, so the unit was redesignated 48th (Hampshire) Searchlight Regiment, RA,(TA).Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. By the end of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted. At the same time 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39‚Äì45 In January 1945, 48th S/L Regiment became 636 (Hampshire) Infantry Regiment, RA. After infantry training, the battalion landed on the Continent on 7 May 1945 (the day before VE Day, and was assigned to Line of Communication duties with 21st Army Group.636 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45Joslen, pp. 402, 463. Postwar =115 Construction Regiment= When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the Hampshire Fortress RE was reformed as 115 Construction Regiment, RE, with its HQ at Fareham and the following organisation:80‚Äì117 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on.576‚Äì873 Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 293, 300, 306. * 127 Construction Squadron * 576 Park Squadron * 577 Construction Squadron * 578 Construction Squadron * 581 Construction Squadron (formed in 1956 from 406 (Hampshire) Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery) In 1961, the regiment was reorganised as 115 (Hampshire Fortress) Corps Engineer Regiment, when 577, 578 and 581 Squadrons became field squadrons, 576 Corps Field Park Squadron became independent, and 127 Squadron was disbanded. The regiment was disbanded when the TA was reformed as the TAVR in 1967, but its personnel became D Company (Hampshire Fortress Royal Engineers) in the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Territorials until that unit was reduced to cadre in 1969.Hants & IoW Volunteers at Regiments.org.

He is perhaps best known for participation in the Wounded Knee incident in the 1970s and for being a radio host. Early life Richard Two Elk was born in Rapid City, South Dakota, and spent his life growing up in different parts of the United States. Two Elk is a direct descendant of Oglala Dakota Chief Two Elk. Richard's brother, Aaron Two Elk, also served in the military during Vietnam and was the president of an Atlanta-based organization, American Land Struggles in Atlanta, and participated as a longtime member of the American Indian Movement. An obituary indicated that Aaron Two Elk died on 5 March 1994 after suffering a massive coronary on 4 March 1999, went into a state of coma and contracted pneumonia while in the hospital. Career Two Elk's career in public radio began in 1977 on a weekly Native American radio program on Pacifica Radio station KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California. When he returned to Boulder, Colorado in the fall of 1978, he collaborated with Native American students to develop a Native American radio program at KGNU-FM. He remained with the station until 1983, when he enlisted in the United States Army. Two Elk served in the army from 1983 to 1987 as a medical non-commissioned officer. After serving in the military, Two Elk has been affiliated with KGNU on a casual basis since 1990, and hosted \\"WinterCamp Chronicles: Indian Voices of Our Times\\" once a month on KGNU over the past 2 years. Two Elk has also established his own Multimedia Production company, OG Productions. Activism Richard Two Elk was a member of the Denver chapter of the American Indian Movement. He was a member of the organization from 1970 to 1975, but stopped being an active member because \\"he did not feel like being used anymore.\\" At some point during the Wounded Knee incident, Richard Two Elk came into contact with civil rights activist Ray Robinson. Although Robinson was declared legally dead, the whereabouts of his body still remain unknown. Robinson's death was attributed to an inability to follow orders. \\"He was sitting on somebody's porch eating oatmeal. An Indian dude came up, ordered him to go see Dennis Banks. Ray said, 'In a minute ‚Äì I'm eating my oatmeal ‚Äì I'll go when I've finished.' The Indian dude got affronted by Ray's lack of servility. The Indian shot Ray dead,\\" Cheryl Robinson wrote. AIM member Richard Two Elk stated about the incident that, \\"He would eat what little food we had. There was no food so everyone was trying not to eat and this guy was eating freely all the time.\\" Of her husband, Cheryl claimed that, \\"Ray did not respond well to that authoritative direction.\\" Richard Two Elk also claimed that Robinson was actually the aggressor in the incident that led to Ray being shot. \\"I think it was just a reaction. He jumped up and he had a knife and started moving and someone reacted. It happened in a couple of seconds. I think it was someone's gut level reaction in the middle of a firefight.\\" Two Elk also alleged that Dennis Banks, founder of the American Indian Movement, ordered members (including Richard) around the Easter holiday, to 'take care' of a White guy who was suspected of being an informant. The White male was tied to a cross in a mock crucifixion style, beat the man and the man was led away, never to be seen by Two Elk again. Two Elk would later provide testimony in the federal trial involving the murder of activist Annie Mae Pictou-Aquash. Richard testified to the fact that Arlo Looking Cloud contacted him around the Fall season of 1994, asking for advice on how to respond to authorities who were investigating the murder, in which Looking Cloud admitted to being involved in the case. Two Elk indicated he believed his adopted brother was involved in Anna Mae's murder, and that over the years, Looking Cloud was only \\"acting on orders.\\" Looking Cloud was convicted in the murder of Annie Mae Pictou-Aquash in 2004. Two Elk would later publish a video entitled \\"Richard Two Elk on Wounded Knee and the Truth- Hijacked & Blinded: The Stolen Legacy of Wounded Knee,\\" in which he criticizes some of the motivations and actions of the American Indian Movement. He was especially critical of the \\"Wounded Knee\\" program/TV series broadcast on PBS network, \\"We Shall Remain.\\" He referred to the 'Wounded Knee siege' segment as being \\"arguably the most massaged documentary in history.\\" Legacy Two Elk would go on to testify about the events which took place during the Wounded Knee incident. He would write the foreword to the book, American Indian Mafia: An FBI Agent's True Story about Wounded Knee, Leonard Peltier, and the American Indian Movement, authored by Joseph H. Trimbach and John M. Trimbach, which served as a recount of the events which surrounded the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the American Indian Movement during the 1970s from the perspective of a former FBI Chief Agent.

It occurs in 1 in 2500 live births. It occurs as a dermal indentation, found along the midline of the neuraxis and often presents alongside infection and neurological deficit. Congenital dermal sinus form due to a focal failure of dysjunction between the cutaneous ectoderm and neuroectoderm during the third to eight week of gestation. Typically observed in the lumbar and lumbosacral region, congenital dermal sinus can occur from the nasion and occiput region down. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for cases of congenital dermal sinus. It ensures that neurological condition does not degrade and prevents infection. Diagnosis can be confirmed through the use of advanced neuroimaging to observe the tract and associated lesions. Embryogenesis During normal development, cutaneous ectoderm separates from neuroectoderm to allow for the insertion of mesoderm. That is, the skin separates from the tissue of the spinal cord to allow proper formation of the vertebral column. In cases of congenital dermal sinus there is a failure in this process, resulting in formation of a persistent connection between the skin and neural tissue. This manifests as a tract extending from the surface of the skin to the spinal cord lined with stratified squamous epithelium, surrounded by dermal and neurological tissue. The tract may terminate in the deep fascia, or even make contact with neural elements. Congenital dermal sinus may form at any point along the midline of the neuraxis, however, the majority form in the lumbar and lumbosacral region (41% and 35% of cases respectively). Diagnosis Congenital dermal sinus is often diagnosed in infants and children. Early diagnosis is important in congenital dermal sinus, so that treatment can be provided early, to prevent progression of associated complications. =Clinical features= There three key hallmarks of congenital dermal sinus: cutaneous abnormalities, infection, and neurological deficits. Cutaneous abnormalities Congenital dermal sinus is a tract from the surface layer of the skin, through the deeper tissues into the cranial or spinal cavity. The skin findings of this tract can include: *Pit along neuraxis *Flat capillary hemangioma *Hypertrichosis *Skin tag *Abnormal pigmentation *Subcutaneous lipoma *Signs of local infection Infection The stratified squamous epithelium of the congenital dermal sinus tract can extend to the spinal fascia of the dura mater or all the way to the spinal cord. Thus, the congenital dermal sinus forms a point of entry for infection, this can allow for the formation of an abscess. Infection can then travel up the spinal cord to result in meningitis, which can be fatal if left untreated. Neurological deficit Congenital dermal sinus is often also associated with spinal fluid drainage, intradural cysts and spinal cord tethering; conveying neurological deficit. Neurological deficit can occur due to spinal cord compression from intradural dermoid cyst growth in the epidermis and dermis. Tethered spinal cord can result in gait difficulties and sphincter dysfunction, as well as compressing the spine. Neurological deficits are more likely to occur where diagnosis has not been timely, allowing cysts and or infection. =Imaging= Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the preferred tool for diagnostic and preoperative imaging of congenital dermal sinus. MRI allows the neural structures to be observed, visualizing the tract and its anomalies and lesions. For example, exposing tethered cord, inclusion tumors or spinal cord malformations. Observation by X-ray is limited in diagnosis, especially due to immature calcification of infants less than 18 months. X-ray may be used in conjunction with MRI or sonogram images to assist preoperatively. Treatment Treatment of congenital dermal sinus involves complete resection of the tract as well as intradural exploration. Prophylactic surgical removal of the congenital dermal sinus tract is beneficial for the patient, allowing neurological and bladder function to be maintained. Early surgical intervention results decreases the risk of infection and/or tumour progression ‚Äì factors typically associated with delayed presentation of congenital dermal sinus. ] Intradural exploration is necessary as excision of the entire tract, as well as any of its intradural connections, reduces need for further surgical intervention. The surgical technique involves ‚Äòremoving the cutaneous lesion in ellipse‚Äô. The tract of the congenital dermal sinus must then be explored and excised, with intradural lesions dissected. If not all epithelial tissue is removed, there is a possibility for the dermoid cyst to reoccur and require further operation. Further operations are limited by postoperative and post-infection scarring. Historically Prior to pervasive use and availability of advanced methods of neuroimaging, it is possible that the rate of incidence of congenital dermal sinus has been supplemented by the incidence of coccygeal pits. Coccygeal pits are distinct from congenital dermal sinus as they are found within the gluteal cleft, rather than above the gluteal cleft. The caudally orientated coccygeal pits are not associated with intradural pathology and do not need to be excised, unlike the cephalically oriented tracts of the congenital dermal sinus which confer great intradural pathology and require surgical intervention. While coccygeal pits occur in 4% of neonate population, congenital dermal sinus is only found in 1 in 2500 live births.

The manor house is known as Orleigh Court.Cherry, A & Pevsner, N. The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, Orleigh Court, pp. 613‚Äì614 Descent of the manor =Ordulf the Saxon= In the 10th century the manor of \\"Orlege\\" was one of the holdings of the Anglo- Saxon Ordwulf (died after 1005), son of Ordgar (d.971), Ealdorman of Devon under King Edgar (ruled 959-975). Ordgar planned for the founding of Tavistock Abbey in 961 which his son Ordwulf put into effect.Thorn, Part 2: chapter 5. Thorn refers to Ordgar, Ealdorman of Devon as \\"Earl of Devon\\" He held the manor by right of his wife Abina, and in 975 gave it as an endowment to Tavistock Abbey. Ordwulf's holding of Orleigh was recorded in an ancient cartulary of Tavistock Abbey, now lost, but quoted from by Dugdale (d.1686) in his Monasticon Anglicanum.Rogers, p.50, quoting Monasticon, Vol.2, p.494 =Tavistock Abbey= The manor is not listed in the Doomsday Book of 1086, but may have been included for administrative purposes in the nearby manor of Abbotsham,Thorn, Part 2: 5,6 which is listed in Domesday Book, held also by Tavistock Abbey. Orleigh next appears in a charter of Pope Celestine III dated 1193 confirming it to the Abbey.Rogers, p.50, quoting Monasticon, Vol.2, p.498 =Denys= Arms of Denys of Orleigh: Azure, three Danish battle axes erect or,Vivian, p.281, pedigree of Denys of Orleigh as seen on ledger stone of Elizabeth Denys (1625-1664) on floor of Orleigh Chapel, Buckland Brewer Church, Devon The Denys family was for many centuries the feudal tenant of Orleigh under the overlordship of Tavistock Abbey until 1538 when the abbey was dissolved in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and continued to hold it thereafter, under the overlordship of the Russell family, Earls of Bedford, who had acquired the abbey and its lands at the Dissolution. The descent of Denys of Orleigh is as follows:Vivian, pp.281-2, pedigree of Dennis of Orleigh; Pole, p.376; Risdon, p.245 *Josceline le Deneys (whose first name was Latinised to Jollenus, Jellanus or Joscelinus) was recorded in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return submitted by Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in South Devon, as holding from him the manor of Pancrasweek, Black Torrington hundred, North Devon, and de Pomeroy himself held it from Tavistock Abbey. This Jollenus Dacus held Pancrasweek as one knight's fee on military feudal tenure. Orleigh formed a sub-manor of Pancrasweek, but was held by him under the non-military tenure of free socage, that is to say it was a heritable estate the service for which was monetary not military.Rogers, p.51, note 6, quoting Calendar of Inquisitions post mortem, 3 James I (Series 2, vol.289, n.76) Dacus held two fees in total from de Pomeroy, as stated in his 1166 return. *Ralph Denys (son) of Orleigh and Pancrasweek, living during the reign of King Henry II (1154-1189)Risdon, pp.234, 362; Pole, p.376 *William I Denys *Jellanus II Denys *Robert le Deneys. In the feudal aid of 1285 he is recorded as holding one knight's fee in Pancrasweek, half a fee at Southwick in Germansweek and half in Manaton (14 miles north of Berry Pomeroy Castle). In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was successor in title to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy. *William II le Deneys (younger son), to whom Robert le Deneys gave Orleigh. *John I le Deneys (son), in possession of Orleigh in 1342Pole, p.375; Rogers, p.51, note 7, quoting Vivian Visitation *Henry Denys (son) *Richard Denys (died 1442) (son), who married Elizabeth Bowhay, daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Bowhay of Bowhay.

She was the half sister of Sultan Selim III. Early life Beyhan Sultan was born on 15 December 1765 in the Topkapƒ± Palace. Her father was Sultan Mustafa III, and her mother was Adil≈üah Kadƒ±n. She had a full sister named Hatice Sultan, two years younger than her. After her father's death in 1774, when she was nine years old, she followed her mother and sister to the Old Palace. Marriage In 1784, her uncle Sultan Abdul Hamid I arranged her marriage to Silahdar Mustafa Pasha, the governor of Aleppo. The marriage took place on 29 April 1784, after the pasha's return to Istanbul. On 5 May, her trousseau, and the next day, Beyhan Sultan herself were transported from the Topkapƒ± Palace to her palace at Caƒüaloƒülu. She was nineteen years old. The two together had a daughter named Hatice Hanƒ±msultan, born in 1785, she was married in 1799. She was widowed at her husband's death in 1798, and like most of the princesses of her generation she didn't remarried. Beyhan had adopted as her own daughter the future imperial consort Ho≈üyar Kadƒ±n, who was to become the wife of her cousin Sultan Mahmud II and the mother of Mihrimah Sultan. Lands and endowments Beyhan received many mukata'as from her brother Selim III and her uncle Abdul Hamid. She was a wealthy princess, owned two palaces on the Bosphorus (Be≈üikta≈ü, Arnavutk√∂y). She was also given the Old √áƒ±raƒüan Palace, one of the sites of the Lale Devri (Tulip period) entertainments, and Beyhan restored it. She received malikanes in the district of Andrusa, Kalamata, Fanar, Karitena and Londar on 1802. In 1796, she appointed Numan aƒüa, the voyvoda of these districts, to act as her agent (keth√ºda) to collect the caizye and 'avariz dues from her √ßiftliks. In 1802, she appointed Al-Hac Hasan aƒüa as her keth√ºda when H√ºseyn aƒüa, a former voyvoda, was too oppressive. She also appears to have received the malikane of the island of Andros and Syros in 1789. In 1801, she had a fountain built in her name in the Kuru√ße≈üme neighbourhood of Istanbul. In 1804, she built another fountain in her name on the banks of Akƒ±ntƒ±burnu. In 1817, she repaired the Mesih Pasha Fountain located in the Hƒ±rka-i ≈ûerif. She also built two fountains near her palaces during the reign of brother Selim. Beyhan Sultan built a school in the vicinity of Ye≈üilioƒülu Palace, opposite of Hatice Sultan Palace in the memory of her mother. The Beyhan Sultan Fountain, which is one of the most beautiful works of the Ottoman art of its kind in the Turkish era, was completely dismantled, but it has not been revived until today, in case of street expansion. Although the Beyhan Sultan Fountain was created entirely under the influence of Western art, it was a monument that marked the location of a beach adorned this coast, apart from being a work that added beauty to the Bosphorus. Patroness of arts Beyhan, her brother Selim, and her sister Hatice Sultan had a considerable enthusiasm for arts. Both Beyhan, and Selim admired Mevlevi Sheikh Galib, probably a major poet of the age, and were his patrons. Born and educated in Istanbul, the son of a Mevlevi dervish, he became the sheyh of the Galata lodge. She also had copies made of his poems. Death Beyhan Sultan died on 7 November 1824, at the age of fifty eight, and was buried in the mausoleum of Mihri≈üah Sultan located in Ey√ºp.

After her first husband died, she married Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. She was a governess to William III when he was a child. Mackenzie suffered because she was a Jacobite and her second husband was executed for leading a rising against James VII and II which was intended to support the Monmouth Rebellion. She worked to keep together the estates of Balcarres despite the tumultuous times in which she lived and her family's support of the Jacobite cause. Her memoirs were published more than a century after her death.  Early life and Balcarres  Mackenzie was born in Brahan Castle in about 1621. Her parents were Colin Mackenzie, the first earl of Seaforth, Viscount Fortrose, and Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, and Margaret, the daughter of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline, Lord Chancellor of Scotland.Brahan Castle, rcahms.gov.uk, retrieved 2 December 2014. She had several siblings, all of whom died young except for an elder sister, Jean (died 1648). Her parents died whilst Anna was a child. Balcarres House After her father's death, in 1633, she resided at Leslie House, the seat of her cousin, Lord Rothes. There she was married in April 1640, against the wish of her uncle, then the head of the family, to another cousin, Alexander Lindsay, master of Balcarres, who became Lord Balcarres in the following year. She worked throughout her life to keep together the estates of Balcarres despite the tumultuous times in which she lived and her family's support of the Jacobite cause.Rosalind K.

In 1647, her husband became responsible for Edinburgh CastleDavid Stevenson, \\"Lindsay, Alexander, first earl of Balcarres (1618‚Äì1659)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, October 2006, accessed 2 December 2014. and in 1651, Charles II became the King of Scots and he promoted her husband to be the Earl of Balcarres. On 22 February 1651, the king paid the couple a visit shortly before the birth of her first child, to whom he became godfather. On the invasion after Worcester, she went with her husband to the Scottish Highlands, where he had command of the royalists. To pay for the debts incurred by Balcarres in the royal cause, she sold her jewels and other valuables, and many years of her subsequent life were spent in redeeming the ruin in which the Balcarres family had been involved. Their support for the king resulted in their estates being seized. Her husband tried to raise a rebellion in Scotland, but in 1654 they were both summoned to France to assist the king. Leaving her own children in Scotland, Anna was chosen to be the governess of the future William III of England in the Hague in 1657. Between Anna, her husband, John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, Kincardine, and Robert Moray there existed a close friendship, as well as family connection. After her husband's death at the Hague on 30 August 1659, her young son, Charles (1650‚Äì1662) became the Earl. The countess returned immediately to Fifeshire, but shortly went on to France, where, being attached to the Presbyterian church, she was instrumental in securing the support of the French Protestant ministers for the king in 1660. At the Restoration, a pension was settled upon her by Charles, who often expressed for her a deep admiration, but it was some years before it was paid. During the interval, she and her children suffered great privations. She remained in England until May 1662, and there became acquainted with Richard Baxter, who declared that \\"her great wisdom, modesty, piety, and sincerity made her accounted the saint at the court\\". The conversion of her eldest daughter and the daughter's subsequent death in a nunnery were a great blow to Anna. In 1662, she returned to Scotland, when from poverty and anxiety she became ill. The King agreed to pay Anna and the elder of her two sons ¬£1000 a year in recognition of the assistance he had received from their family. The money was not a complete gift as they had to return the governorship of Edinburgh Castle. Her son Charles died in October 1662, whereupon Colin succeeded as 3rd Earl of Balcarres. In 1664, her financial condition improved by the payment of the promised pension, for which she had petitioned in November 1663, but the friendship with Lauderdale appears to have been broken off. The next few years were spent in trying to pay off the debts upon the Balcarres estates, and in 1669, her son's rights on the Seaforth estates were given up by her for the sum of 80,000 marks.  Countess of Argyll  Anna with her second husband, Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. This engraving was the frontispiece of her memoirs but it is thought to be another person On 28 January 1670, she married Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. After this marriage, she was able to assist with the debts inherited by her son, Colin, from her first husband. However, her son failed to take advantage of this financial opportunity.Paul Hopkins, \\"Lindsay, Colin, third earl of Balcarres (1652‚Äì1721)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2007, accessed 29 November 2014. Her second marriage did not go well either and her husband was sentenced to death for high treason. He managed to escape to Holland due to the brave intervention of Anna's daughter, Sophia Lindsay, who smuggled him away disguised as one of her servants. It was said that Sophia only escaped a public whipping for helping her step-father because of the intercession of the future James II. Anna was in time supported financially by the King despite her husband's estates being seized. Her husband supported the Monmouth rebellion by raising a rebellion in Scotland to partner the force established in England by the Duke of Monmouth. Anna was arrested as soon as her husband arrived in Scotland to raise the rebellion and placed in Edinburgh Castle.A memoir of Lady Anna Mackenzie, countess of Balcarres and afterwards of Argyll, 1621‚Äì1706, p. 124, Alexander Crawford Lindsay, 1868. Argyll was eventually executed, as his father had been before him. After her husband's death, his son Charles married his saviour: Anna's daughter, Sophia Lindsay. Anna was buried probably beside her first husband and their son Charles in the Balcarres chapel, although no record of interment is found in the parish books. Her memories were gathered together and published in 1868 by Alexander Crawford Lindsay the 25th Earl of Crawford.A memoir of Lady Anna Mackenzie, countess of Balcarres and afterwards of Argyll, 1621‚Äì1706, Alexander Crawford Lindsay, 1868.

Early life Ay≈üe Sultan was a daughter of Sultan Murad III, and his consort Safiye Sultan. She had three full siblings, two brothers, Sultan Mehmed III, and ≈ûehzade Mahmud, and a sister, Fatma Sultan. Marriages In 1582, Murad betrothed Ay≈üe to Ibrahim Pasha. However, her grandmother, Nurbanu Sultan was against this marriage, because she wanted her adoptive son, the kapƒ±cƒ±ba≈üƒ± Mahmud, who when still a child had been given to her by her husband Sultan Selim II, to be married to Ay≈üe. For this reason, Ibrahim Pasha was appointed Beylerbey (governor- general) of Egypt. After Nurbanu's death in December 1583, Mahmud married the daughter of ≈ûemsi Pasha in December 1584. In this way, he gave up every hope to eventually marry Ay≈üe, since in order to marry a princess a man had to repudiate his other wives. The marriage took place in 1586. Her wedding took place at the Old Palace, and was celebrated in a seven-day ceremony. Historian Mustafa Selaniki mentions the preparations, the presents which were given by both parties, the feasts, prepared for the Nakib√º'l-esraf and the sadat, for the ≈ûeyh√ºlislam (supreme religious leader), the ulema and for the high-ranking officials. A year into the marriage, Murad dismissed Ibrahim Pasha from his post, because according to the chronicle of Hasan Beyzade, his damat, or bridegroom, status was an obstacle to sailing. Ibrahim served three times as Grand Vizier to Ay≈üe‚Äôs brother Sultan Mehmed III. Ay≈üe Sultan was widowed upon Ibrahim Pasha‚Äôs death on 10 July 1601. Yemi≈üci Hasan Pasha became the new Grand Vizier. A telhis of Hasan Pasha announced that the Sultan Mehmed promised him the hand of Ay≈üe in marriage. In accordance to this telhis, historian Mustafa Naima suggests that Yemi≈üci Hasan Pasha and Ay≈üe Sultan were only engaged. The wedding took place on 5 April 1602. A year after the marriage, Mehmed decided to execute Yemi≈üci. Ay≈üe dispatched a post to her mother, Safiye Sultan, and her brother, in which she promised that if the Sultan could forgive her husband, they could go to Mecca without any further charge or trouble. However, the Sultan replied to her indicating that she should accompany him in death if she insisted. Yemisci was executed on 18 October 1603. In 1604, she married G√ºzelce Mahmud Pasha. Charities Ay≈üe was infamous for her charity. In her testament, she gave the following instructions for her inheritance: her slaves and slave girls were to be manumitted unconditionally; 10,000 ak√ßes were bequeathed to cover the cash debts of people detained in prison for debts of up to 500 ak√ßes; 2,000 ak√ßes were for the poor, sick and orphans, and the remainder for the poor in the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. A certain amount of money was allocated to pay the ransom for Muslim prisoners of war, with the condition that female captives be freed first.

The Government of India honoured Khan in 2012, with the fourth highest civilian award of Padma Shri. Biography 1969 Painting from Hasht-Behesht palace, Isfahan, Iran showing a Kamancha player Sakar Khan was born on 9 August 1938 at Hamira, a small village in the Jaisalmer district of the Indian state of Rajasthan, in the Manganiar community, known for their traditional music. His father, Chunar Singh, was a renowned kamayacha (kamaicha) musician and the young Sakar started learning kamayacha (kamaicha)from an early age under the tutelage of his father to earn a name for himself later. Khan has performed in many parts of the world, notably in Brussels, at a concert at the Cirque Royal Auditorium, organized by the International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, titled, From the Sitar to the Guitar where he played alongside such musicians as Yehudi Menuhin and Pandit Ravi Shankar. His concerts have taken place in countries such as US, France, Japan and USSR and has performed with George Harrison, the Beatle, and Sultan Khan in London. Sakar Khan, who is credited with getting the Rajasthani kamancha noticed at the world stage, is reported to have made innovations to the instrument, originally a rabab look alike stringed instrument composed of a goat skin covered body and three or four main and fourteen sympathetic strings by adding to the number of sympathetic strings to enhance the emotional appeal of the instrument. His renditions of Bhairavi raga and Kalyani raga have been stored in the ethnomusicology archives of Smithsonian Folkways, the record label of the Smithsonian Institution. His performance at The Manganiyar Seduction, was as a guest of honour at the Purana Qila in Delhi in November 2010, following which the organisers, Amarrass Records, made analogue field recordings of the maestro at his home in Hamira, Rajasthan, released as At Home: Sakar Khan (Amarrass Records) in September 2012. This remains the only album released by Sakar Khan. His last public performance was at the Amarrass Desert Music Festival 2012 in December in New Delhi, India. Sakar Khan died on 10 August 2013 due to respiratory illnesses and is survived by his wife, Bubba Devi, their four sons and two daughters. Four of his sons, Ghewar Khan, Feroze Khan and Darra Khan,Satar are known kamayacha (kamaicha)musicians and accompany their father on concerts. Awards and recognitions The Government of Madhya Pradesh awarded Sakar Khan the Tulsi Samman in 1990. The next year, in 1991, he received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award from the Government of India which, twenty one years later, followed it up with the fourth highest civilian award of Padma Shri, in 2012.

February 14, 945Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.) was a general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Min. In 944, he and another general, Zhu Wenjin, assassinated the emperor Wang Yanxi (also known as Wang Xi, Emperor Jingzong). He then supported Zhu as the new emperor of the Min state, but the officer Lin Renhan () assassinated him and Zhu less than a year later and submitted to Wang Yanxi's brother Wang Yanzheng, who had been warring with Wang Yanxi.  Background and service under Wang Yanjun  Little was recorded in history about Lian Chongyu's background. He was said to be \\"of Guangshan\\" (ÂÖâÂ±±, in modern Xinyang, Henan)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. ‚Äî i.e., nearly the same geographic origin as Min's founder Wang Shenzhi and Wang Shenzhi's older brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shengui (), who were from nearby Gushi (Âõ∫Âßã, also in modern Xinyang) ‚Äî which would have meant that, if he was actually born there, he would have been one of the old guard soldiers who settled with the Wang brothers in the Min region; it is possible, however, that he was one of those soldiers' sons but still said to be from Guangshan.See in general New Book of Tang, vol. 190. During the reign of Wang Shenzhi's son Wang Yanjun (also known as Wang Lin, Emperor Huizong), when he organized Wang Shenzhi's closest guards into two elite corps, the Gongchen () and the Konghe (), he made Zhu Wenjin the commander of the Gongchen and Lian the commander of the Konghe.  Service under Wang Jipeng  Wang Yanjun was killed in a coup in 935, and was succeeded by his son Wang Jipeng (also known as Wang Chang, Emperor Kangzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Wang Jipeng created his own elite corps, the Chenwei (), and treated them better than he did the Gongchen and the Konghe, such that the soldiers of the two corps were alienated. He also alienated Zhu Wenjin and Lian Chongyu by repeatedly insulting them. Hearing of discontent in the Gongchen and Konghe ranks, he considered sending them away from the capital to Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) and Quan (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) Prefectures, respectively, causing fear in the two corps. In 939, someone set fire to Wang Jipeng's northern palace, causing a large fire in the palace complex. Wang Jipeng ordered Lian to command 10,000 soldiers (apparently both the Konghe and other corps) to carry out the cleanup of the palace complex, and this difficult labor caused the soldiers to be distressed. At one point, Wang Jipeng came to suspect Lian of being involved in setting the fire, and considered killing him. The imperial scholar Chen Tan () informed this to Lian. Therefore, one night when Lian was on night duty, he took the opportunity to command the Konghe and the Gongchen to rise against Wang Jipeng, and then to also get other corps to join in. With only the Chenwei defending him, Wang Jipeng was defeated. He tried to flee to Min's northern neighbor Wuyue, but was captured on the way and killed. Lian supported Wang Jipeng's uncle (Wang Yanjun's younger brother) Wang Yanxi (also known as Wang Xi, Emperor Jingzong) to be emperor. (Zhu's role in this coup was not clearly stated.)  Service under Wang Yanxi  Zhu Wenjin and Lian Chongyu apparently remained in command of the imperial guards during Wang Yanxi's reign, as Zhu remained in command of the Gongchen Corps, and Lian received the title of director of palace security (Èñ£ÈñÄ‰Ωø, Geimenshi). Fearing that they would eventually be punished for Wang Jipeng's death, they had their families enter into marital relationships to form a power bloc. Meanwhile, Wang Yanxi's reign was a violent one, and it caused apprehension in them, particularly after he killed one of their close associates, Wei Conglang () (who had become the commander of the Konghe Corps). Further, on another occasion, Wang Yanxi recited in their presence, in one occasion, Bai Juyi's poem, which stated, \\"When it comes to matching people's hearts, one cannot have any expectations even when they were physically close.\\" They wept and bowed to him, proclaiming their faithfulness, but drew no response from Wang Yanxi. Meanwhile, Wang Yanxi's wife Empress Li had become jealous of his favor for his concubine Consort Shang. She wanted him dead so that their son Wang Yacheng could become emperor. She therefore sent messengers to Zhu and Lian, informing them that Wang Yanxi was suspicious of them. In spring 944, Empress Li's father, the chancellor Li Zhen () happened to be ill. Wang Yanxi went to visit him, and Zhu and Lian used this chance to have the Gongchen officer Qian Da () assassinate Wang Yanxi. They then summoned the officials at the imperial gathering hall, stating to the officials: With no one daring to speak against them there, Lian pushed Zhu onto the throne and put imperial robe and crown on him, and then led the officials in bowing to him, proclaiming themselves as subjects. Zhu thereafter claimed the title of emperor.  Service under Zhu Wenjin  Zhu Wenjin had some 50 members of the Wang imperial clan arrested and executed, although he had Wang Yanxi buried with ceremony due an emperor. When the official Zheng Yuanbi () refused to submit to him, he first forced Zheng into retirement, and when Zheng tried to flee to Wang Yanxi's younger brother Wang Yanzheng ‚Äî who had been in civil war with Wang Yanxi for years and who had claimed the title of emperor of a splinter state of Yin at Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. ‚Äî he had Zheng killed. He put Lian Chongyu in charge of the army. He also tried to reverse some of Wang Yanxi's unpopular policies, by ending palace construction projects and by releasing the ladies in waiting from palace service. Wang Yanzheng immediately sent his general Wu Chengyi () to attack Min's capital Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou), but was unable to capture it. Thereafter, Zhu sent the army officers Huang Shaopo () to serve as the prefect of Quan and Cheng Wenwei () to serve as the prefect of Zhang, apparently to affirm his control of those prefectures. The prefect of Ting Prefecture (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian), Xu Wenzhen (), also submitted to him. When he sent emissaries to try to establish friendly relations with Min's (and Yin's) northwestern neighbor Southern Tang, however, Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing put his emissaries under arrest and intended to attack him, but could not do so immediately due to the heat and spread of disease at the time. In fall 944, Zhu apparently stopped claiming the title of emperor. Instead, he claimed only the title of acting military governor of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, headquartered at Fu Prefecture) and acting overseer of the state of Min, and he sent emissaries to Later Jin to submit as a subject. In response, Later Jin's emperor Shi Chonggui commissioned him as full military governor of Weiwu and acting overseer of Min. In winter 944, a group of officers at Quan, led by Liu Congxiao, rose up against and killed Huang, submitting to Wang Yanzheng and supporting Wang Yanzheng's nephew Wang Jixun () to serve as acting prefect. Hearing of this, the Zhang officer Cheng Mo () assassinated Cheng Wenwei and supported another nephew of Wang Yanzheng's, Wang Jicheng (), as acting prefect, in submission to Wang Yanzheng. Xu Wenzhen also submitted Ting Prefecture to Wang Yanzheng. Around new year 945, Shi created Zhu the King of Min and gave him the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Hearing of what happened at Quan and Zhang, Zhu sent the officers Lin Shouliang () and Li Ting'e () to attack Quan. With aid from Wang Yanzheng's general Du Jin (), however, Liu crushed Lin's and Li's army, killing Lin and capturing Li. Wang Yanzheng then again sent Wu to attack Fu, and faced with this threat, Zhu sent his son(s) and brother(s) to serve as hostages to Wuyue, seeking aid from it. Meanwhile, Wang Yanzheng warded off an attack from the Southern Tang general Cha Wenhui (). However, hearing of this, Wu decided to take advantage to intimidate the people at Fu, claiming (falsely) that the Southern Tang army was intending to aid the Yin army in attacking Fu. This caused great fear in the people at Fu, and apparently caused Zhu to have the chancellor Li Guangzhun () to take the imperial seals to offer them to Wang Yanzheng (i.e., effectively to surrender). Shortly after, before any negotiations could begin with Wang Yanzheng, the officer Lin Renhan led a group of 30 soldiers in attacking Lian's mansion, stating to them, \\"We have served the Wang clan for generations. Now we are under the control of an usurper. If the Prince of Fusha [(i.e., Wang Yanzheng, who carried the title of Prince of Fusha under Wang Yanxi)] arrived, how could we see him again?\\" He personally killed Lian, and then cut off Lian's head to show the rest of the army, stating to them, \\"The Prince of Fusha will soon be here. All of your families will be slaughtered. Now Lian Chongyu is dead. You can save yourselves by seizing Zhu Wenjin!\\" The soldiers were encouraged, and they followed him in killing Zhu. Lin opened the gates to welcome Wu in, and sent the heads of Lian and Zhu to Wang Yanzheng.

It continued in the postwar TA until AA Command was disbanded in 1955. Origin 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA units into searchlight (S/L) battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). One unit selected for was the Hampshire (Fortress) Royal Engineers which already operated searchlights in the coast defence and AA defence roles in Portsmouth. On 1 November 1937 three of its companies, together with a newly-formed company in Southampton, became 48th (Hampshire) AA Battalion, RE with the following organisation:Monthly Army List, various dates.Litchfield, p. 97.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 104, 110, 114. * HQ at Portsmouth * 391st Anti- Aircraft Company at Portsmouth * 392nd Anti-Aircraft Company at East Cowes, Isle of Wight * 393rd Anti-Aircraft Company at Gosport * 394th Anti-Aircraft Company at Southampton The following year, the battalion came under the command of 35th AA Brigade, based at Fareham, which formed part of 5th AA Division.Routledge Table LX, p. 378. World War II =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of World War II, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. The AA Battalions of the RE were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) on 1 August 1940, so the unit was redesignated 48th (Hampshire) Searchlight Regiment, RA.Frederick, pp. 859, 868.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339.

This battery later joined 85th S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 861. By the end of the Blitz in May 1941, 48th S/L Rgt was part of 47 AA Bde in 5th AA Division with 391, 392, 393, 394 S/L Btys under command, and remained there for a year. 47 AA Bde was a purely S/L formation covering the area round Southampton.Farndale, Annex D.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. =Mid-War= In May 1942 47 AA Bde acquired heavy and light AA gun units in addition to its S/L layout. The following month a new 72 AA Bde joined 5th AA Division, and 393 S/L Bty was temporarily attached to it. In September 1942 AA Command was reorganised and its divisions abolished; at the time of these changes 48 S/L Rgt went back to 35 AA Bde but returned to the command of 47 AA Bde by December; both were in the new 2 AA Group covering South-East England.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.

Now equipped with Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) guns, the regiment formed part of 73 AA Brigade (the former 47 AA Bde), based at Reading, Berkshire, though this brigade was disbanded in 1948.Frederick, p. 1024.564‚Äì591 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. =675 (Hampshire) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment= With the reconstitution of the TA in 1947, there was a proposal to reform the 69th (Duke of Connaught's Hampshire) Anti-Tank Regiment as 393 HAA Regiment, but a change of plan saw a completely new Hampshire unit raised with the number 393, soon changed to 675th (Hampshire) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, with its HQ at Southampton and forming part of 61 AA Brigade (the former 35 AA Bde at Fareham). However, the 1950s saw the rapid reduction in AA units, and 675 HAA was absorbed by 583 HAA on 1 January 1954. Little more than a year later, AA Command itself was disbanded (on 10 March 1955), and 583 (Hampshire) HAA Regiment was disbanded at the same time.Frederick, pp. 1010, 1030.

In 1949, he was a co- author of the Handbook of Natural Gas Engineering, which is still used by engineers in the industry. Later, while teaching at Rice University, he became well known for his pioneering work in phase equilibrium, physical properties and transport properties which were highly important to the development of the natural gas processing industries. He belonged to several professional associations, including: * American Chemical Society (ACS) * American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) * American Institute of Chemists * American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers * Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas * Japan Institute of Chemical Engineering * National Academy of Engineering (NAE) He also belonged to Sigma Chi, Alpha Chi Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Lambda Upsilon, and Phi Kappa Phi.\\"Riki Kobayashi Fellowship in Chemical Engineering.\\" Rice University. George R. Brown School of Engineering. Retrieved November 28, 2014. Personally warm and approachable, Dr. Kobayashi was addressed simply as Riki by nearly all of his graduate students throughout his career. Graduate students who had come directly from Japan were the exception; they used the Japanese honorific \\"sensei\\" (teacher), a sign of great respect.  Honors and awards  The AIChE honored Kobayashi by presenting a symposium in his honor in 1987, where the society called him, \\"..‚Äúone of the century's most prolific researchers in thermodynamic and transport properties.‚Äù He received many other professional honors during his lifetime. Among these were: * Appointed to Louis Calder Chair in Chemical Engineering at Rice in 1965. * Outstanding Engineering Award by Rice University in 1985. * First annual Donald Katz Award by the Gas Processors Association in 1985. * Election to National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1995. * Albert Einstein Medal awarded by the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences in 2010. The Riki Kobayashi Fellowship in Chemical Engineering was created in his honor. The first award was made in 2005.  Personal life  Kobayashi was born in Webster, Texas on May 13, 1924. His parents were Mitsutaro and Moto Shigeta Kobayashi. Both parents were born in Japan. Mitsutaro Kobayashi's occupation was listed as a farmer. He was survived by his wife, two sons, two stepdaughters, a brother and three sisters.

Life =Early years= Neddermeyer was born in the Altona district of Hamburg during the final years of the Bismarck era. His father was a port worker and a sailor. On leaving school his early work included periods both at sea and, as a building worker and later on the railways and as a Hamburg telegraph operator, on land. He became a trades unionist in 1901 and in 1904 he joined the Social Democratic Party. He interrupted his work with the telegraph service for a period of service in the navy between 1909 and 1912, and then served in the navy again during the First World War. He was an active participant in the Kiel mutiny which kicked off the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. =Weimar years= During the 1914/18 war the political left in Germany split, primarily over the issue of support for the war, and following the foundation of what later became known as the Weimar republic, Neddermeyer joined the newly formed German Communist Party (KPD). In the Autumn of 1921 he underwent a political training course at the Party School in Berlin, and then between 1922 and 1926 served as party secretary to various regional Communist Party Associations, including a period at Bielefeld in 1923 when he took on a regional leadership party function. 1924 began as a crisis year, with inflation out of control and acute economic hardship widespread. There were two national elections in a single year. At the first of these, in May, Robert Neddermeyer was elected as a KPD member of the National Reichstag in Weimar. Communist party support nationally fell back later in the year after the reparations issue was partially addressed and the economy began to stabilise, but Neddermeyer held on to his own Reichstag seat until 1928. In 1924 he had also participated in the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern. Following the death of Lenin and his successor's change of strategy, the German Communist party became riven with internal divisions of its own. In 1925 Neddermeyer sided unambiguously with the so-called \\"ultra-left\\" faction. On leaving the National Assembly in 1928 Neddermeyer was promptly elected to the Regional Assembly in Prussia, where he sat as a member continuously till 1933. Meanwhile, in 1930 he also became the owner of a small poultry farm near Liebenwalde, which he held on to till 1945, while also working as a poultryman for other farmers in the area. In 1930 he also found time to become a city councillor in K√∂nigsberg, another office which he retained till 1933. In 1931 he established the Revolutionary Agricultural Workers' Association of East Prussia (Revolution√§ren Landarbeiterverband Ostpreu√üen), becoming the organisation's first chairman. =Nazi years= In January 1933 the Nazi Party seized power and rapidly put an end to multi-party democratic government. Neddermeyer became part of the (necessarily underground) illegal Communist resistance in Germany. His activities included editing \\"Socialist Republic\\", an underground newspaper based in Cologne with a circulation of between 1,000 and 2,000 copies per edition.J√ºrgen Stroech: Die Illegale Presse. Eine Waffe im Kampf Gegen den Deutschen Faschismus, 1979, p 231 On account both of his Communist past and of his resistance activities, between 1933 and 1945 Neddemeyer frequently found himself arrested and placed in prisons or concentration camps. He was interned in concentration camps at Sachsenhausen and at Esterwegen. On 18 July 1944 he was arrested as a member of the Anton Saefkow group and on 6 October 1944 sentenced to three years in prison, but his sentence was cut short in April 1945 when he was released from the prison at Brandenburg-G√∂rden as the war ended. =The Soviet occupation zone / East Germany= In 1945 Robert Neddermeyer served briefly as the mayor of Liebenwalde, the town near to which he still owned a small chicken farm. Between 1945 and 1946, he was Deputy Administrator of the important Niederbarnim region, subsequently renamed. In parallel to this he also served as District High Commissioner in Bernau. He was also de facto chairman of the Brandenburg State Land Commission and Brandenburg regional secretary (later chairman) of the Peasants' Mutual Aid Association (VdgB / Vereinigung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe). The VdgB had some of the features of a political party. East Germany is generally identified as a one party state because one party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) monopolised power. But there were other parties - for most of the time five - with fixed quotas of seats in the National Legislative Assembly (Volkskammer), were organised into a single Bloc party. This was controlled, along with other \\"mass organisations\\" by the ruling SED (party) through an institution called the (East German) National Front. The VdgB was one of the mass organisations included in the National Front and which also, from 1953 till 1960 (and again after 1986) had seats in the Volkskammer. Neddermeyer succeeded Richard Kramer as secretary of the VdgB in March 1947, continuing in this position for approximately eighteen months. He then, in 1949, briefly served as the orqanisation's chairman. He also, in 1948, became a member of the Brandenburg Regional Assembly where between 1950 and 1952 he sat on the Agriculture and Forestry Committee. His career in the Brandenburg assembly came to an end when the Brandenburg assembly was dissolved as part of a wider reconfiguration of regional government. Much power passed now to Berlin, while residual powers of the regional assemblies were transferred to District Assemblies: in 1952 Richard Neddermeyer became a member of the Potsdam District Assembly.

The island has an area of about 1.1392 km2 (712 rai) and there are about 42 households. Most of the local people are Buddhists who earn money by exporting seafood. Other sources of income include growing coconut trees, which explains why the island has many coconut trees. The residents make coconut juice to sell to tourists and to export. Phitak Island is close to the coast and the all flat areas are coconut plantations, so there is no room to build a school or a temples. Tourists can walk everywhere because footpaths are laid out along around the island. The Ko Phitak community is known as an excellent environmental conservation community, which is particularly known for its giant clam conservation center. About Ko Pitak Map of the island  History  In the past, neighboring people called this island \\"Phi Tak\\" (), which means \\"ghost greeting\\". There is a story about a fisherman who sailed a boat to catch fish near the island. He said that he saw a human shadow waving a hand and yelling out something to him, so he sailed the boat to the island, but there was nothing. After that, the island had been named Phi Tak, as people thought that the shadow was a ghost. Then, some people from the coast, who were not afraid of the ghost story, emigrated to the island. Finally, the name of the island was changed to \\"Phi Thak\\" () which means \\"protect\\" because the people who lived there wanted to change the name to be more auspicious. Tourism Each year, Ko Phithak welcomes more than 100,000 visitors. The local people live in wooden houses built along the coast with high spaces underneath to allow the flow of the tides. The villagers take care of each other, and the tradition of \\"song keang\\" () (sharing homemade dish with others) still exists in the island. The west side to the south side of the island has most houses because the mountain in the east blocks the prevailing wind. The best beach is on the east side, called \\"peace of eastern\\" beach, 400 m long with clear water. The north of the island has a lot of viewpoints, 200 meters in height, and small rest pavilions. The annual marathon walking activity during ebb tide season is well known in Chumphon Province. This activity is carried out by people in Lang Suan and some non- local people by walking from Pak Nam (lit., estuary) to the island in order to promote unity of community and health. There are several good diving sites nearby. Among them are Ko Ngam Yai, Ko Ngam Noi and Ko Rang Ka Chiu, part of Mu Ko Chumphon National Park, which covers 317 square km and has a sea area of 165,969 rai.

She is known for developing mathematical models of viruses based on higher-dimensional lattices.Stewart, Ian. The mathematics of life. Basic Books, 2011. Education Twarock originally studied mathematical physics at the universities of Cologne and Bath. During her PhD at Technische Universit√§t Clausthal she experimented with quantum mechanical models confined to the surface of a sphere. Research In the early 2000s, while thinking about the Penrose tiling and different ways of dividing the surface of a sphere, she was able to come up with a model describing the exceptional structure of papovaviridae, answering a question in virology that had been open for more than twenty years.R. Twarock, A tiling approach to virus capsid assembly explaining a structural puzzle in virology, Journal of Theoretical Biology, Volume 226, Issue 4, 21 February 2004, Pages 477-482, ISSN 0022-5193 Almost all icosahedral viruses have the proteins on their capsids clustered in fives and sixes, with a structure permitting at most 12 clusters of five; but papovaviridae, including the cervical-cancer-causing HPV, have 72 clusters of fiveRayment, I., et al. \\"Polyoma virus capsid structure at 22.5 A resolution.\\" Nature 295.5845 (1982): 110-115. This protein layout did not correspond to any spherical polyhedron known to mathematics. Twarock's model of papovaviridae had to be mathematically as well as biologically novel - it resembles a Penrose Tiling wrapped around a sphere. After this, Twarock entered virology, and began to rigorously link virus structure to fundamental ideas in geometry. It was well understood that viruses have icosahedral shape and symmetry, but the only other thing that was said of them was that they sometimes they possessed planar translational symmetry, causing them to resemble goldberg polyhedra. The question of the exceptional nature of papovaviridae had been solved, but it was not a one-off - HK97 could not be considered a goldberg polyhedron either. Twarock's study of these viruses lead her to believe that there was much more insight into virology that could be gotten from mathematics. Mathematical virology had previously only studied the surfaces of virus, using models that were tilings of the 2-sphere; Twarock hoped to go further than this, to illuminate three-dimensional protein structure and genome packaging. It was known that, using rotations, simple capsid patterns could be \\"generated\\" from a single shape by making copies of it and moving them around in ways that preserve the symmetry. Twarock decided to consider adding an outward translation to this generating process, which created a quite complex patterns of points in 3D space. These patterns turned out to very accurately predict the shape and size of the proteins, as well as the structure of packaged genetic material, for many viruses including Nodaviridae.Keef, Thomas, and Reidun Twarock. \\"Affine extensions of the icosahedral group with applications to the three-dimensional organisation of simple viruses.\\" Journal of mathematical biology 59.3 (2009): 287-313. The models turned out to be useful for studying the assembly and genomes of RNA viruses. The way that these viruses assemble requires the proteins to bind to specific sequences in the genome that end up in 3-dimensional locationsRolfsson, √ìttar, Middleton, Stefani, Manfield, Iain W. et al.

Twarock (2014) On the subgroup structure of the hyperoctahedral group in six dimensions, Acta Cryst A 70, 417-428 More insights were gained using the \\"cut and project\\" method of generating penrose tilings. Her models can be thought of as squashed-down three dimensional pictures of the 6-demicubic honeycomb tiling, a \\"six-dimensional version\\" of the three- dimensional Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. Different viruses are modelled by different subsets of the vertices of this lattice. The viruses appear to use these patterns because they are the most stable way of connecting multiple interacting layers that all have icosahedral symmetry.

He got his first British title shot in March 1920 against Jim Sullivan after reigning champion Pat O'Keeffe retired from boxing; Gummer won after Sullivan retired in the 14th round. He followed this with a win over Bandsman Jack Blake and a draw with Herbert Crossley before fighting Ercole Balzac for the European middleweight title in Paris in December 1920; Gummer was knocked out in the ninth round. He had a second shot at the European title in March 1921 against Gus Platts, a fight in which Gummer was also defending his British title; Gummer retired in the sixth round, losing his title. Gummer's final fight was against Ted Kid Lewis in February 1922 at The Dome in Brighton; Intended as a fight for Lewis's British middleweight title, it was fought as a non-title catchweight bout after Gummer failed to make the weight; Lewis knocked Gummer out in the first round. After retiring from boxing, Gummer played football for Rotherham Eastwood in the 1920s and worked as a boxing referee between the late 1920s and the 1940s. Tom Gummer married Myra McMahon and they had four children together. He died in Rotherham in 1982.

His feast day is 13 February. Saint Dyfnog Dyfnog was the son of Medrod ab Caradog Freichfas and a brother of the grandfather of Cwyfen, coming to the area from North Britain. Dyfnog is said to have come from a wealthy family but chose to become a monk and to live simply. He built a small wooden church on the property which is now the Church of St Dyfnog, Llanrhaeadr. The 16th-century Welsh poet Dafydd ap Llywelyn ap Madog included a tribute to Saint Dyfnog among his works. It is said that the poet was cured from a pain in his ribs and made a pilgrimage to the saint's well in thanksgiving. There is also a cywydd (a traditional Welsh poem) to him by an anonymous poet in Llanstephan MS 167 dating to the end of the 17th century. The poet says there was an image of Saint Dyfnog in the church at Llanrhaeadr. He described him as a man who had renounced the world, wore a shirt of thick horse hair fastened with an iron belt, lived on bread and water and did penance by standing under the stream of cold water. He continued by describing the variety of miraculous cures owed to the water of Saint Dyfnog's Well and the vast number of people who came to bathe there. Saint Dyfnog's Well St. Dyfnog's Well Saint Dyfnog chose to settle in an isolated wooded area with a spring-fed stream. The stream had a waterfall; legend has it that because Saint Dyfnog would stand in the cold waters for extended periods doing penance, clad in a hairshirt with a chain belt of iron; this was the reasoning for its curative powers. Over time, the stream became known as Ffynnon Dyfnog or Dyfnog's well. As devotion to the saint increased, the waters became known for their healing powers. Many pilgrims came to bathe in the waters and pray, hoping to be cured of their ailments. The waters of the well were reputed to be especially effective for skin conditions, arthritis and rheumatism. Those seeking relief for their illnesses would leave a donation to be used for the upkeep of the well and the church. Saint Dyfnog's Well was one of the most visited holy wells; because of the offerings from the well, St Dyfnog's was able to buy the elaborate 16th century Tree of Jesse window. The site appears to have been at the height of its popularity from the 16th to the 18th century. The sunken stone bath dates from the 16th or 17th century. The bottom of the stone bath is said to have been lined with marble at one time. During this time, various structures were built around the well and bath to accommodate the many pilgrims. Browne Willis wrote in 1721 that there were rooms for changing into bathing clothing and other buildings; one was said to be a chapel which had images of the 12 Apostles in its lower half. Thomas Pennant said the fountain was \\"inclosed in an angular wall decorated with human figures and before it is the well for the use of the pious bathers\\". In later times the well and its surroundings fell into neglect. Richard Fenton's 1808 visit to the well found that the building which formerly enclosed the bath had fallen in and was ruined with the \\"bath choaked up\\". By 1880 little evidence of the former buildings on the site remained. Attempts were made to revitalise the site; some bridges were built over the stream and small statues were again brought to the area surrounding the well. The well remains a popular place for pilgrims; some churches have visited the well to conduct baptisms using the water of the well. The site of the well was named a Grade II Listed Building 29 November 1999. =Restoration= The Llanrhaeadr Preservation Society began discussing a restoration of Saint Dyfnog's Well in 2012. Their initial focus was on its preservation but as time went by, the aspects of heritage, culture and the effect on the environment were also realised. The Society sought funding from the Lottery Heritage Fund and a rural enterprise agency, Cadwyn Clwyd. They hope their efforts will result in a religious tourist attraction and centres for the environment and education. The restoration project began in August 2019. The initial excavation found that the site was also a quarry used to make stone tools some 6,000 years earlier.

L. fungicola infects the casing layer on the cap structure of several edible mushrooms. This fungal pathogen does not typically infect wild mushrooms, but more commonly cultivated mushrooms are infected such as A. bisporus, which are typically grown in large quantities. Severity of disease depends on several factors, including timing of infection and environmental conditions. Dry bubble follows the typical verticillium life cycle, although insect vectors play a large role in the spread of this disease. Control for L. fungicola is limited, and strict measures must be taken to prevent the spread of infection. L. fungicola is a devastating pathogen in the mushroom industry and causes significant losses in the commercial production of its main host A. bisporus. Annual costs for mushroom growers are estimated at 2‚Äì4% of total revenue. Host range and symptoms Dry bubble mainly affects three different species of mushrooms: Agaricus bisporus, A. bitorquis, and Pleurotus ostreatus. It has been isolated from numerous other basidiomycetes, including a few wild mushrooms. However, there has not been enough research into dry bubble pathogenicity to define an exact host range. A. bisporus, white button mushroom, is the main host of Verticillium dry bubble disease. Worldwide, 40% of commercially produced mushrooms are A. bisporus. When infecting A. bisporus, dry bubble is unable to infect the vegetative mycelium and can only infect the fruit bodies. This means infection must take place in the casing layer, a layer of material, usually mulch put on top of the mushroom. In general, dry bubble symptoms are dependent on the time point of infection, affecting both the type and severity of the disease symptoms. Symptoms are mild when inoculation occurs during casing layer applications, and severe when inoculation takes place 14 days after the casing layer has gone down after the mushrooms have poked through. Interactions between the pathogen and the host in the casing layer can either result in stipe blow-out or dry bubble. Early infections can cause stipe blow- out in which part of the fruit body of the mushroom becomes deformed, accompanied by splitting or peeling of the stipe tissue. L. fungicola also causes totally deformed and undifferentiated white masses of mushroom. If inoculation occurs in the late stage of the mushroom life cycle, symptoms include small necrotic lesions on the cap of the mushroom. Other symptoms may include brown, light brown, or gray discolorations on the cap or the stipe of the mushroom. Infection by L. fungicola does not decrease the weight of the mushroom crop, but has the potential to decrease the total number of mushrooms produced. Therefore, dry bubble is thought of mainly as a cosmetic disease.  Life cycle  The symptoms of infection depend on the developmental stage of which the fungal host becomes infected. Irregularly shaped, light brown necrotic lesions are found on mushroom caps infected later in their development. Characteristic malformed mushrooms, classically known as dry bubble, infection occurred during the early stages of development. Spread of dry bubble disease is associated with insect vectors. Mites and springtails get stuck on the dry bubbles because their movement becomes impeded by globules of spores stuck to their legs. These insects fly from mushroom cap to cap and spread the conidial L. fungicola spores, which are stuck to their legs from landing on infected mushroom caps. Sclerotia from L. fungicola can remain viable in the soil for more than a year in natural soil. Most conidial spores do not germinate, and the few that do germinate in soil only have short germ tubes. In sterilized soil and peat, however, spores readily germinate, and after 7 days, extensive mycelium and sporulation is visible. The phenomenon that germination and growth of fungal propagules is inhibited by active soil microorganisms is typical for most soils and is known as soil fungistasis. Germination of L. fungicola spores requires an external nutrient source. Even though spores of the pathogen can germinate in sterile water, germination and germ tube growth are greatly stimulated by the addition of nutrients. It was proposed that carbon is the stimulating factor. Fungistasis is not only caused by nutrient depletion, the production of inhibiting compounds also contributes to inhibition of spore germination. The earliest infestation by the L. fungicola spores can happen as early as casing time, but not before. Usually the spores that land on the deposited compost will not cause disease. It has been observed that even spores that are on the compost before casing do not cause disease development. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that very high populations of spores applied to the compost before casing can induce disease development. Once the casing is applied and rhizomorphs start to mature, then it seems Verticillium spores can become viable and spore source. These asymptomatic mushrooms can carry conidial spores and sclerotia that can be spread by growers, harvesters and other personnel. Control =Hygiene= Management and control of dry bubble disease relies mainly on hygiene and prevention of introducing inoculum on mushroom farms. Strict hygiene practices are the best mechanism of control once dry bubble has been identified. Farmers can maintain strict hygiene practices by removing all wastes immediately from the farm. Prevention of mites and flies can help eliminate the spread of the pathogen throughout the crop, because whiteflies and springtails are capable of transporting spores from infected to healthy mushrooms.Tsarev, Alexander. \\"Dry bubble (fungus spot) or Verticillium disease.\\" Dry bubble (fungus spot) or Verticillium disease. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2014. Casing mixture should be prepared and stored in a clean room away from mushroom wastes, outside soil, insects, and rodents help prevent introduction of the pathogen to the crop. =Disease recognition= Disease recognition also helps control the disease early on. Once the symptoms of the disease are present in part of the crop, removal of the infected mushrooms is necessary as soon as possible. Teaching harvesters and workers to identify and treat dry bubble disease is a practice that will reduce or eliminate the level of inoculum. All infected mushrooms should especially be removed before harvesting and watering takes place in order to prevent further spread of inoculum on workers‚Äô clothes or in splashing water. =Fungicides= The use of select fungicides to control L. fungicola can be effective by reducing the amount of present inoculum, but there are many issues with this approach. First, few chemicals can be used because all mushroom hosts are naturally sensitive to fungicides. Second, the pathogen has developed resistance to many fungicides over time and they are found to be increasingly less effective. The capability of the fungicide to kill the pathogen has been greatly diminished to a point where fungicide is almost ineffective. For example, L. fungicola has become resistant to benomyl, a common fungicide that is toxic to microorganisms. Third, the use of fungicides to combat L. fungicola may be banned in the near future and not be available to control the pathogen. Legislative involvement is restricting the type of chemical controls that can be used to fight this particular pathogen. The only effective and currently legal chemical control for dry bubble disease is Sporgon (active ingredient: Prochlorax-Manganese). Sensitivity of L. Fungicola to Sporgon has decreased, so increasing concentrations of Sporgon must be used to combat dry bubble disease. =Resistant strains= Resistant strains of A. bisporus to L. fungicola have granted a lot of research but only reveal strains with partial resistance. The commercial and susceptible A. bisporus strain is Sylan A15 and the main partial resistance strain is MES01497. While there are still necrotic lesions present on the cap surface of the brown partial resistant cultivar there has been shown to be less hyphae and sporulation.Grogan, Helen. \\"Detecting Dry Bubble Disease on Mushroom Farms.\\"Teagasc Technology Updates (2012): n. pag. Web. 21 Oct. 2014.http://www.teagasc.ie/publications/2010/1551/5695-Vert-CELUP-Technology- Update.pdf A lack of pathogen recognition would imply that mushrooms rely on constitutive and wound induced defenses.Berendsen, Roeland L., Niek Schrier, Stefanie I. C. Kalkhove, Luis G. Lugones, Johan J. P. Baars, Carolien Zijlstra, Marjanne Weerdt, Han A. B. Wosten, and Peter A. H. M. Bakker. \\"Absence of Induced Resistance in Agaricus Bisporus against Lecanicillium Fungicola.\\" Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek 103.3 (2013):539-550. Web. 7 Nov. 2014 The response of partially resistant strains of Agaricus are similar to the hypersensitive response in plants where cells in the infected tissue die and encapsulate the infection. The discovery of A. bisporus defense responses might help explain the differences in susceptibility between Sylvan A15 and MES01497. More research is needed to look into additional strains of A. bisporus that show resistance to L. fungicola. = Environmental controls = Spores of dry bubble are capable of resting for 7‚Äì8 months in dry environments without germinating, resulting in a reservoir of inoculum which may reinfect. Three environmental conditions of growth unfavorable to spores may be used in prevention: anaerobic conditions, low PH, or high temperatures above 40 ¬∞C.Berendsen, Roeland L., Stephanie I.C. Kalkhove, Louis G. Lugones, Han A.B. W√∂sten, and Peter A.H.M. Bakker. \\"Microbial Inhibition of Lecanicillium Fungicola in the Mycosphere of Agaricus Bisporus.\\" R. L. Berendsen Thesis - Utrecht University (2011): 33-51. Web. Anaerobic conditions and high temperatures may both be achieved by heated composting of casing and debris which is removed from the growing area in order to eliminate viable spores. In between crops, steam treatments of the growing area can effectively eliminate inoculum; this technique is best used when the facility can be completely sealed and heated in between crops. =New methods= Another management technique that has been recently researched is the use of volatile 1-octen-3-ol on infected hosts of L. fungicola. While more research is needed to contribute its effects on management, it has been shown that 1-octen-3-ol inhibits the germination of L. fungicola and that enhanced levels can effectively control the pathogen. Another function of 1-octen-3-ol, is that application stimulates growth of bacterial populations in the casing and of the Pseudomonas spp., demonstrated to play part in the onset of mushroom formation in A. bisporus.  Environment  Environmental conditions within the growing area can greatly affect the rate of growth and spread of dry bubble. Most importantly, factors of RH (relative humidity) and temperature are most important. Dry bubble favors warm, humid environments for growth. This coincides with environmental preferences of white button mushroom, its primary host, which favors a RH of 85% and warm temperatures of 25 ¬∞C.Marwaha, Sudeep. \\"Cultivation of White Button Mushroom.\\" Cultivation of White Button Mushroom. Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute, n.d. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. http://agridaksh.iasri.res.in/html_file/mushroom/white_button_mush.htm. Given that dry bubble cannot actively grow without a host, this is logical; however, it makes the use of environmental controls of the pathogen challenging. If timed well with harvest, dry bubble may be suppressed to some degree by controlling the environment. If RH is lowered 10% and temperature lowered 5-10 ¬∞C, the growth of pathogenic mycelia and germination of spores may be slowed with minimal impact to harvest.Beyer, David M., Paul J. Wuest, and Jacquelyn J. Kremser. \\"Verticillium Dry Bubble - Mushrooms (Penn State Extension).\\" Vegetable, Small Fruit, and Mushroom Production. Penn State, n.d. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. However, it is inevitable that any environmental alterations which affect dry bubble will similarly affect the mushroom crop which is its host.  Importance  Verticillium dry bubble is the most prevalent disease of A. bisporus, and the most serious fungal pathogen of all commercial mushrooms. Commercial losses to white button mushroom growers are 2-4% of annual revenue. If dry bubble infects and is left uncontrolled in the mushroom growing environment, the disease can wipe out an entire crop in 2‚Äì3 weeks. Moreover, the disease may be devastating for years following the initial infection because spores are capable of resting in debris and reinfecting crop to crop. Dry bubble was first detected in a commercial planting in North America in 1981. However, literature on dry bubble has been published in India as early as 1960, proving that it has been an economic problem for mushroom growers during much of the 20th century. Dry bubble is thought to originate from North America or Europe, and is prevalent on both continents. Because few fungicides are effective and even fewer are legal, dry bubble is likely to remain the most critical disease to mushroom growers in Europe and North America in the future unless breakthroughs in research are made.

Many dishes in the region today, whilst retaining their original characteristics, frequently add new facets, whilst old dishes are being rediscovered and combined with current recipes. Mecklenburg food has traditionally been considered as rather down-to-earth and hearty. It reflects, on the one hand, the simple life of the region of Mecklenburg, long dominated by agriculture, and on the other hand, its long Baltic coastline and the abundance of its inland waters. In addition, its vast forests produce a wealth of game. Potatoes, known locally as T√ºften, play a particularly important role in the region also, as evinced by the existence of a potato museum (the Vorpommersches Kartoffelmuseum) in neighbouring West Pomerania), and a variety of cooking methods are used to prepare them. Other staples are kale, known as Gr√ºnkohl and a sweet-and-sour flavour produced, for example, by using dried fruit. Although Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania have both had long, independent histories, the similarity in living conditions and landscapes in both regions has resulted in both populations having similar eating habits.

MockServer is designed to simplify integration testing, by mocking HTTP and HTTPS system such as a web service or web site, and to decouple development teams, by allowing a team to develop against a service that is not complete or is unstable. Simplify testing MockServer simplifies automated testing and promotes best practices by improving the isolation of the system under test, simplifying test scenarios and improving encapsulation and separation of concerns in tests, as follows: * Mocking dependent systems is an effective mechanism to isolate the system under test to ensure tests run reliably and only fail when there is a genuine error, this avoids tests failing due to irrelevant external changes such as network failure or a server being rebooted / redeployed. * In addition to test isolation mocking dependent system also allows the full range of responses and scenarios to be tested without having to set up and manage a complex test infrastructure. For example, increased response delay or dropped connections can increase as load increases on a dependant system. To simulate these types of performance related degradation can be extremely difficult without generating a large volume of traffic. If the dependent system is mocked the mock can control the exact response delay or any other characteristics of each response. * A common anti-pattern for automated tests is to record and replay real dependent service responses. These recordings are typically complex and shared between multiple tests. This, however, introduces unnecessary coupling between tests and breaks the Single responsibility principle, which, states that every context (class, function, variable, etc.) should define a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the context. Record and replay solutions also break down when the response changes. For example, if a bookshop service is mocked by recording a response containing a list of 50 books, when the format for a book changes then the recorded response must be updated in 50 places. If a new response is recorded with the new format, most likely, the test assertions will need to be updated. In addition record and replay approaches hide the data being used in the test from the test code and therefore break encapsulation and separation of concerns. MockServer simplifies the mocking of responses for dependent systems by providing a simple API and client in multiple languages. Each test can then independently encapsulate the data and logic used for mock services, ensuring each test runs independently. In addition such an approach also reduces the time for a suite of test to complete because tests can run in parallel and do not share data. Decoupling development teams MockServer decouple development teams, by allow a team to develop against a service that is not complete or is unstable, as follows: * If an API or service is not yet fully developed MockServer can be used to mock the API allowing any team who is using the service to start work without being delayed. Mocking an API or service during development of an application can often increase the cost of integration because the longer the delay before systems are fully integrated the more expensive it can be to refactor or reverse incorrect design decisions with prevent integration. However, often two systems that integrate must be built parallel due to financial or time pressure. If an application is being built against an unstable and unreliable interface this can lead to the development and testing being frequently blocked. Mocking the unstable interface can provide more control over when and how the integration is performed to reduce the overall disruption and cost. * Mocking a service also allows development teams to isolated from an unstable, unreliable or volatile web service. This is particularly critical during the initial development phases when the APIs / services are changing frequently and cause development and testing to be blocked. Features The main features supported are * return a specific response when a request matching an expectation has been received * return a response dynamically when a request matching an expectation has been received * execute a callback (in Java) when a request matching an expectation has been received * verify a requests has been sent a specific number of times * verify a sequence of requests have been sent in a specific order * record requests and responses to analyse how a system interacts with external dependencies Technology MockServer is built using Netty and is written in Java. It runs on as an embedded server on a separate Thread or as a standalone Java Virtual Machine. MockServer can be used in several ways: * via an Apache Maven Plugin as part of an Apache Maven build cycle * programmatically via an API in an @Before or @After method in a JUnit or TestNG test * using a JUnit @Rule via a @Rule annotated field in a JUnit test * from the command line as a stand-alone process in a test environment * as a Docker container in any Docker enabled environment * as a Vert.x module as part of an existing Vert.x environment * as a deployable WAR to an existing web server * as a grunt.js plugin as part of a grunt.js build cycle * as a Node.js (npm) module from any Node.js code MockServer is available as: * a stand-alone Netty web server that is fully self-contained * a deployable WAR that runs on any Java Enterprise Edition web server * a fully encapsulated Docker container * a Vert.x module that runs on a Vert.x See also * Service virtualization * Comparison of API simulation tools * Mock object * Software testing * Integration testing References Category:Software testing Category:Software design patterns ","title":"MockServer"},{"id":"44544279","text":"The chorus frog (Pseudacris) is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae found in North America ranging from the Pacific coastline to the Atlantic.

The seven reels of what is now being called Bert Williams' Lime Kiln Field Day features a black cast and white crew, and is now the earliest surviving feature-length film in which the main characters are black and middle class. The cast is made of black performers from Harlem five years before what is thought of as the official start of the Harlem Renaissance. In addition to the legendary Bert Williams the film also features Sam Lucas, Abbie Mitchell and J. Leubrie Hill with members of the Darktown Follies Company.Magliozzi, Ron. \\"EXHIBITIONS.\\" MoMA.

One of the three directors of the film was a black man, and the footage shows a lot of interaction between the black cast and white crew. Bert Williams is seen in blackface before he became famous on Broadway, and the romance between Bert Williams and Warren is a first example of affection for black characters in film. The film also has one of the longest early records of black vernacular dance on film, an elaborate cakewalk scene. The film features some racial stereotypes but also shows interactions between black cast members and white crew members.

It was founded in 1994 by Dan Kohn and Roger Lee, both former London School of Economics students, and by Guy H. T. Haskin and Eiji Hirai from Swarthmore College. The New York Times has credited the company with performing the first secure retail transaction on the Internet. History NetMarket was initially conceived by Dan Kohn while he was studying at the London School of Economics after finishing an honors degree in economics from Swarthmore College. He recruited classmate and Yale graduate Roger Lee to become president of the company. The company's management team was rounded out by Guy H. T. Haskin and Eiji Hirai, both from Swarthmore and both hired for their technical skills. The firm's initial headquarters was a house in Nashua, New Hampshire. It started out selling goods such as CDs and books for various offline stores using non-digital payments. On August 11, 1994, NetMarket sold Ten Summoner's Tales, a CD by Sting, to Phil Brandenberger of Philadelphia using a credit card over the Internet. The New York Times characterized this as \\"...apparently the first retail transaction on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee privacy.\\" The encryption used in the transaction was provided by the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program, incorporated into the X Mosaic browser. The author of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, called the transaction an important step towards the creation of digital cash. NetMarket was soon purchased by CUC International and despite expectations to the contrary, continued to be successful. While general online malls were superseded by specialty shops and forced to close, NetMarket continued to expand the range of its inventory. In 1997 the chairman of CUC estimated the company could fill approximately 20% of a family's retail needs with that number going up to 95% in three years. The company was also profitable, estimating doing more than $1 billion in sales in 1998. The Economist called NetMarket's business model the third wave of online retailing - one site providing goods found in an entire mall, but focused on the efficiency and low prices provided by specialized retailers. Also in 1997, CUC paid America Online $50 million to set up and promote NetMarket's services on AOL's Shopping Channel. In 1999, NetMarket, now owned by Cendant, had its ordering system breached due to a bug in its software. Customer names, addresses, and phone numbers could have been shown publicly along with order details for as many as 983,000 orders stretching back to June 1998. NetMarket was spun off by Cendant in 2001 under a new parent company, Trilegiant.

Grandson of Petras Mantigirdaitis, he first appeared in written sources in 1476 and reached his career high in 1490s when he was Voivode of Trakai (1490‚Äì97) and Grand Marshal of Lithuania (1491‚Äì97). Chronicler Marcin Bielski described that Alexander Jagiellon was crowned and blessed as the new Grand Duke of Lithuania by the Bishop of Vilnius in 1492. Then Mantigirdaitis presented Alexander with a naked sword and a reminder that Alexander was elected to be a just ruler. In 1494, Mantigirdaitis was sent on the diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the Grand Duchy of Moscow and marriage of Helena of Moscow to Alexander to end the First Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War. Mantigirdaitis is mentioned as the first Great Hetman of Lithuania. The Bychowiec Chronicle describes how Grand Duke Alexander visited ailing Mantigirdaitis in Trakai and asked for his recommendations for a successor. Mantigirdaitis recommended Konstantin Ostrogski. Mantigirdaitis is also mentioned as Hetman in a surviving copy of a donation document by Grand Duke Alexander that Vytas Jankauskas dated March 1494. If the date is correct, this would indicate that the Hetman position developed during the First Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War (1492‚Äì94). Offices Mantigirdaitis held the following offices: * Starosta of Braslaw (1476‚Äì82) and Lutsk (1486‚Äì89) * Marshal of Grand Duke (1480‚Äì82) and Volhynia (1487‚Äì89) * Voivode of Trakai (1490‚Äì97) * Grand Marshal of Lithuania (1491‚Äì97) * Great Hetman of Lithuania (1494‚Äì97) Family There is no information available on his father, thus historians assume he died in his youth. Mantigirdaitis was married twice. His first wife was Anna, daughter of Jonas Vƒó≈æeviƒçius, regent of Smolensk. They had a son and a daughter. Their son Jonas died in the Battle of Vedrosha ending the family line. Their daughter Sophia married Stanis≈Çaw Kiszka, who inherited the family's substantial wealth. Mantigirdaitis' second wife was Anna, daughter of Alexander Olshanski or of , son of Kaributas; they had no children. In 1482, Anna funded the Chapel of Holy Trinity in Vilnius Cathedral.

Albayrak was born to Turkish-German parents; she lived in Gelnhausen and was studying to become a German and ethics teacher at the University of Giessen. The incident was widely reported in German and Turkish media and engendered a national debate in Germany about youth crime and civil courage. Incident Place of incident According to witnesses, the attack took place after Albayrak had attempted to intervene in a situation between three men who were harassing two teenage girls in the toilets of the McDonald's restaurant. One of the men later attacked her outside, in the restaurant's parking lot. A surveillance video showing the attack was published online by the Bild newspaper on 1 December. Police say the video had not been cleared for publication and they are investigating how it came to be released. The video shows Albayrak standing among a group of people in the parking lot. After a few minutes, the attacker enters the image. He is visibly agitated, gesticulating towards the group while being held back on one arm by a friend. The attacker leaves the field of view, and re-appears shortly, now about 20‚Äìm from the group. Albayrak is seen leaving the group to confront the attacker. The attacker's friend is now standing immediately between attacker and victim. The attacker suddenly strikes past his friend, hitting the victim, who falls to the ground immediately.P. Rossberg, \\"Das Beweis-Video. BILD zeigt, was in der Nacht wirklich geschah +++ Melden sich jetzt die Zeugen?\\",Bild, 1 December 2014. Albayrak sustained severe brain damage and fell into a coma. Doctors pronounced her brain dead on 26 November. Her parents decided to remove her life support on 28 November, her 23rd birthday. The attacker was identified as Sanel M., a citizen of Serbia, whose place of birth was variously reported as the Sand≈æak region of southwestern Serbia and Offenbach, Germany. M. was reported as having a previous record of violence in Germany, including a conviction for battery, besides counts of burglary and theft. Hannelore Crolly, \\"Damit muss der Verd√§chtige im Fall Tug√ße A. rechnen\\", Die Welt, 27 November 2014. He was taken into custody and was said to have admitted to attacking Albayrak. In June 2015, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for manslaughter. In April 2017 he was deported to Serbia and barred from Germany for eight years. Reactions The attack and its aftermath were intensely covered by both Turkish and German newspapers. The Turkish-language German paper Sabah Avrupa in its 16 November edition cited one of the victim's friends, who described the incidents in terms of \\"the Serbs waited for us and insulted us again. But we defended ourselves, and one of them slapped me, then he ran over to Tuƒü√ße and punched her\\". Other Turkish newspapers picked up on the attackers being a \\"Serb\\" and several newspapers published a photograph showing the attacker grinning. Takvim labelled the photograph \\"the Serbian butcher\\". Frankfurter Rundschau criticized the ethnic connotation in Turkish media, pointing out that the attacker is a native of Sand≈æak, a region predominantly inhabited by Bosniaks, and Offenbach police issued a statement saying they have no indication that the attack had any \\"ethnic background\\".Timur Tin√ß, Frankfurter Rundschau, \\"Der serbische Schl√§chter\\". T√ºrkische Medien zum Fall Tuƒü√ße A., 27 November 2013. On 27 November, hundreds of people held a vigil outside the restaurant, followed by a number of vigils across Germany on 29 November, with a total number of attendees in the thousands. Bosniak-Swiss footballer Haris Seferoviƒá offered a tribute to the victim by means of a message on his T-shirt following his goal in Eintracht Frankfurt's 2‚Äì0 Bundesliga win over Borussia Dortmund on 30 November. After her death, more than 200,000 people signed an online petition calling for the German president to posthumously award her the Federal Order of Merit.

This is where Dorit Schmiel and her party attempted their escape to West Berlin in 1962. Former Todestreifen (death strip), from East Berlin to West Berlin. This is where Dorit Schmiel and her party attempted their escape to West Berlin in 1962. Dorit Schmiel (April 25 1941 ‚Äì February 19 1962) was a German seamstress who became the thirteenth known person to die at the Berlin Wall. Schmiel was fatally shot by East German border guards while attempting to escape from East Berlin to West Berlin with a group of friends, including her fianc√©. Schmiel was one of only eight women to die at the Berlin Wall, and at 20 years-old was the second youngest woman victim. Biography Dorit Schmiel was born on April 25, 1941, in Berlin, Nazi Germany, during the Second World War, in which her father died as a soldier. Schmiel and her older brother were raised by her mother and step-father in the East Berlin district of Pankow. By the time Schmiel was 20 years-old, she had moved in with her fianc√©, Detlef Teuchert, and worked as a seamstress in a state-run manufacturing company in Pankow. Ever since she was a child, she traveled regularly to West Berlin to visit relatives, go shopping, watch movies, or go dancing. On 13 August 1961, East German authorities abruptly sealed off the sector border, and began construction of the Berlin Wall. The subsequent loss of freedom to visit the west was a painful turning point in her life. Together with three other friends: brothers Eberhard Brede and Dietrich Brede, and Dietrich's girlfriend, Brigitte Kie√üling, they decided early in 1962 to attempt to escape to West Berlin.Wenn Tote st√∂ren: Vom Sterben an der Mauer - 2007 German documentary about deaths at the Berlin Wall The group had felt dissatisfaction with the political situation in East Germany, and because it had now become apparent that division of Berlin would be permanent. They decided on a place in the northern part of East Berlin, where Schmiel's cousin had previously escaped. Death On February 19, 1962, after midnight on a misty and cloudy night, the five friends approached the border to West Berlin's Reinickendorf district from the east side at Rosenthal, in Pankow. After observing the movement of the East German border guards, they sneaked through a cemetery known today as \\"Friedhof Pankow VII\\" to its back fence, which also comprised the inner fence of the border security strip. Using wire cutters they cut a hole in the first fence, and one after another crawled through the hole, and through the snow towards the outer border fences. They had almost reached the outer fence across the Berlin Wall's \\"death-strip\\" when border guards noticed them and began shooting at them, hitting Schmiel in the abdomen. The gunshot caused her to cry out, and only then did the guards stop firing and approached the group. The remaining four surrendered, and obeyed the order to stand up, but Schmiel remained on the ground bleeding profusely, and crying in pain. She was transported to the Krankenhaus der Volkspolizei (People's Police Hospital) in Mitte, where she died later that same night. Burial Dorit Schmiel was buried on March 2, 1962, in Section 29B of the cemetery known today as \\"Friedhof Pankow III\\", in Sch√∂nholz, Niedersch√∂nhausen.,The registry of the Friedhof Pankow III, in Sch√∂nholz Like Friedhof Pankow VII, where the escape attempt took place, Friedhof Pankow III also on the border to Reinickendorf. Supplementary forces of the People's Police virtually sealed off the funeral, preventing the participation of many mourners from Niedersch√∂nhausen. As of 2012, her grave no longer exists. Aftermath The other escapees were interrogated for hours that same night and were tried a month later, where they were indicted for \\"an act that seriously endangered society\\" and which could have endangered peace by inciting \\"provocations from the class enemy.\\" The Pankow district court sentenced them to prison terms ranging from ten months to two years. Thirty years later, Dorit Schmiel‚Äôs friends acted as witnesses and joint plaintiffs in the trial of the three border guards (Hans- J√ºrgen D., Rainer R., and Horst B.) who had shot at the group, killing Schmiel and wounding Eberhard Brede. It was not possible to determine which guard had fired the shots that killed Dorit Schmiel and wounded Eberhard Brede, and because they were all under 21 at the time, they were tried in a youth criminal court in Moabit, and found guilty of joint manslaughter in coincidence with attempted manslaughter, and sentenced to 18 months in prison, which was commuted to probation.

Early life and education  Born in Pest, Madar√°sz came from a wealthy family of minor nobility. Because he was financially independent, he could devote his entire life to scientific work. He attended the University of Budapest, first studying medicine, and then zoology. In 1880, he completed a doctoral thesis on the anatomy of birds of the family Paridae.  Scientific career  Starting in 1879, Madar√°sz was an employee of the Hungarian National Museum. He worked there until his retirement in 1915, ultimately serving as the director of the ornithology department. During his tenure, he vastly increased the size of the collection through his own efforts and through purchases. Madar√°sz travelled to every part of Hungary over the course of his career, and authored a number of authoritative works on the birds of central Europe. At Lake Fert≈ë, he regularly observed avian migrations. In 1881, he created a checklist of the birds of Hungary. In 1884, he founded the German-language ornithological journal Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Ornithologie, which he published and edited for five years, as well as contributing to the wealth of illustrations that it contained. From 1894 to 1893, he published Magyarorsz√°g Madarai, a comprehensive and well-illustrated encyclopedia of Hungarian birds, that remained an important reference for decades. Madar√°sz also undertook collecting trips and expeditions around western Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, making him one of the first Hungarian ornithologists to extend his studies beyond the local avifauna. On an 1895‚Äì96 expedition to Ceylon, he collected specimens of at least 125 species. In 1911‚Äì12, he travelled through Sudan to the Blue Nile, but he had to cut the trip short when he came down with malaria. He published a monograph entitled The Birds of Cyprus in 1904, and wrote several publications cataloging the birds collected by an expedition led by S√°muel Fenichel and Lajos B√≠r√≥ in New Guinea. He described several species collected by him and by other ornithologists, among these species the green-breasted pitta and Szechenyi's monal-partridge. In total, he published over 150 ornithological works. Madar√°sz was a Foreign Member of the British Ornithologists' Union and a Corresponding Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. A species of bird, Madarasz's tiger parrot (Psittacella madaraszi), was named after Gyula Madar√°sz by Adolf Bernhard Meyer in 1886.  Artistic work  A painting of macaws by Madar√°sz Madar√°sz was tutored in painting by Antal Ligeti, who also worked at the Hungarian National Museum. Madar√°sz's landscape paintings and paintings of animals were exhibited in the National Salon and National Art Gallery in Budapest, and he also mostly illustrated his ornithological articles and books himself.

Knights compete in the Greek Rugby League Association's 2017 Championship, which are currently in first place. They competed and were declared undefeated champions of 2014 and 2015 Hellenic Rugby League Federation's 1st Championship Division and 2016 Greek Rugby League Association's Championship. They are 2015 Greek Rugby League Challenge Cup holders. History The club was founded in 2010 as a Rugby Union club. Their motto ‚Ä≥aut inveniam viam aut faciam‚Ä≥ became the spirit of the club upon its creation. Club's main goals are to play a leading role in the Greek league and in amateur sports in general. Knights have participated in many social activities not restricted to the sport and thus aspire to familiarize people with Rugby. Also, their main objective is to restore the principles of fair play through sport and the promotion of Rhodes as an active and dynamic cultural center, open to stimuli received from the alternative sports tourism. In 2012, Knights were joined by players of the Rhodes Colossi team and, by the provisional name of Rhodian Rugby Unity, were admitted in the Hellenic Rugby League Championship. In 2013, Knights won the Greek Rugby League 9's Championship and by 2014, they won, undefeated, the inaugural Hellenic Rugby League Championship. The 2015 season found Rhodes Knights still strong in the field. By May 2015, despite dominating all of their opponents, the Federation's Disciplinary Committee have found Knights susceptible to a number of violations, which ultimately resulted in their demotion to second-to-last place of the Championship's points board. Under the threat of disbanding the Federation and within days of Hellenic Rugby League Championship's Final set date, Disciplinary Committee dismissed Knights for the majority of violations. But by then, Knights, along with Aris Petroupolis and Pegasus Neos Kosmos, had formally resigned from the Hellenic Rugby League Federation, as well as the 1st Division Championship, submitting a no confidence vote to the current Hellenic Rugby League Federation Board and demanding the resignation of the HRLF Board. Pegasus were declared Champions due to the inability of hosting a final game. Still, in May 2015, Knights hosted with the majority of Pegasus's team that had resigned the Greek Rugby League Challenge Cup. On May 30, 2015, Pegasus, under the name Attica Rhinos were defeated by Rhodes Knights. In 2016, Knights and Patron Achaikos Athletic Club - Patras Rugby co-create Greek Rugby League Association, due to the inability of the former Hellenic Rugby League Federation to successfully host the Championship, as an aftermath to previous year's discrepancies. Joined by Attica Rhinos and Aris Eagles, they host the 1st GRLA 2016 Championship, which Rhodes Knights win undefeated. In October 2016, Knights host the Rhodes 8's Rugby League Tournament, which featured all four GRLA teams and were joined by the teams of Australian Greeks, Rhodes Knights B-Team, and Kadƒ±k√∂y Ragbi Spor Kul√ºb√º Club. Australian Greeks won the 8's tournament in the final game against Kadƒ±k√∂y and Rhodes Knights B won third place against Aris Eagles. The following days, Rhodes hosted a Rugby XIII International Friendly Match between Greek Nationals of GRLA and Turkish Nationals of Turkish Rugby League Association. In a stunning clash, GRLA's players won their Turkish counterparts, with a commanding appearance. Rhodes Knights were represented in the GRLA National Team by a number of players, including Nikolaos Bosmos, Stefanos Bastas, Dimosthenis Kartsonakis, Georgios Tsiakos, Panayiotis Lampousis, Antonios Chatzimarkos, Spiridon Kigais and Pantelis Arfaras. In 2017, Greek Rugby League Association were granted observer status by Rugby League European Federation and was licensed by RLEF and Rugby League International Federation as the sole Greek Organization for conducting matches, competitions and technical courses in the sport of Rugby League. Rhodes Knights compete in the 2017 GRLA Championship, which are currently in first position and they will defend their title in the June 2017 Final. Colours Club's jerseys have been mainly black, as were the colours of the Hospitaller Knights of Medieval Rhodes. Up until 2014, jerseys have had white Maltese crosses on their right main side and left shoulder aera. Shorts were black and white. Since 2014, the club is using black jerseys with a red and white \\"V\\" around the collar, with a white cross on the right arm, and black shorts. Emblem Since 2014, Rhodes Knights are using the red-detailed shield-shaped emblem displaying a Hospitaller knight, the characteristic white cross and year of establishment.

The album was released in March 1988, with some of the tracks featuring Donnie Iris on vocals. Background During 1984-85, Mark Avsec began working on a solo project under the moniker Cellarful of Noise. After releasing the album of the same name that year, both Avsec and Donnie Iris maintained that Donnie Iris and the Cruisers were still their main focus. The band returned to the studio in 1986 and recorded a new album titled Cruise Control; however, a lawsuit with the band's former label MCA resulted in the shelving of the album. With the band's current label HME going out of business, the band became an unsigned act. Since the band had come to a halt, Avsec started working on the second Cellarful of Noise album Magnificent Obsession. This time, however, he approached Iris to help on the project, and he provided lead vocals on a selection of tracks, as well as co-writing a couple of them. Alan Greene once more contributed guitar parts, while the Cruisers' Marty Lee also added some guitar.http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/usa/cleveland/cellarful+of+noise Released in 1988, the album produced a moderately successful single, \\"Samantha (What You Gonna Do)\\", which reached No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1988. Afterwards Avsec backed away from the music scene as a solo act and has since continued to perform and record with Iris as well as pursue his full-time career as an entertainment lawyer. In a 1988 interview with AOR Basement, Avsec revealed to Ian McIntosh: \\"After doing another LP [with Donnie Iris] called \\"Cruise Control\\", I went off to work with Mason Ruffner on his \\"Gypsy Blood\\" LP. After that I started doing the new Cellarful of Noise record and eventually I asked Donnie if he'd like to team up with me and he was into that. Then we went to England (Bath) to mix it, and now here's that record coming out...\\" He also spoke of the debut Cellarful of Noise album: \\"Right after it came out, I wanted to get more serious about it and make a better sounding record.\\" When asked about the future of the project, Avsec stated \\"For now we're watching what's happening - if the new LP does well then we'll eventually put together a band and hit the road. I'm always writing new material too. Obviously Donnie and I are looking forward to doing another record when the time comes.\\" The album features a cover of \\"Heartzone\\", a song originally performed by the band The Innocent on their 1985 album Livin' in the Street. The band featured drummer Kevin Valentine and guitarist Albritton McClain, who were both members of Donnie Iris and the Cruisers. Avsec revealed of the song to AOR Basement: \\"I heard that song right after it was first done in the studio and it totally slayed me! Unfortunately the record company never picked up on it. So I asked Rodney Psyka if I could use it and he said yes. It's quite noticeable that on my version there's no guitars - I wanted to make it sound a bit different, even though it was a real guitar song before.\\" The only single from the album, \\"Samantha\\", has lyrics concerning a teenager deciding whether or not to have an abortion after an unplanned pregnancy. Released on 7\\" vinyl in America only, it featured the album track \\"Shuck and Jive\\" as the B-Side. When released, CBS were busy focusing on the promotion of Henry Lee Summer single \\"I Wish I Had a Girl\\". Meanwhile, \\"Samantha\\" remained in the lower regions of the Billboard Hot 100. Once Summer's single began rising in the charts, CBS announced that \\"Samantha\\" was now the label's first priority. Speaking to The Pittsburgh Press in March 1988, Iris spoke of the situation: \\"As far as \\"Samantha\\" is concerned, it was doing everything that it was doing on its own, without a lot of help from the record company as far as a video, a CD and all that stuff. Well, now that Summer's record is a breaker, they're ready to concentrate on our record. As long as they can pull it off and do a number on the record at this point with promoting it right and getting it on the radio stations, then we'll be satisfied. But to be honest with you, if they lose it at this point, we won't be very happy. Yeah, we will be very disappointed if the song doesn't hit.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat;=19880329&id;=upMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VWMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5156,9391377 Recording The album was recorded in Avsec's basement studio \\"The Cellar\\", in Twinsburg, Ohio, which was equipped with MIDI. It was mixed by Ted Hayton, Avsec and Iris at Crescent Studios in Bath, England. The album was mastered by Jack Skinner at Sterling Sound in New York City. \\"Samantha\\"'s vocals were recorded at Jeree's Studio in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, while the guitar was recorded at Beachwood Recording Studios in Beachwood, Ohio. The song was digitally transferred and mixed by Joe Barbaria at Soundworks Studio, New York City.Cellarful of Noise - Magnificent Obsession - Vinyl LP back credits - CBS Records - BFZ 40341 Iris enjoyed making the album using the MIDI method, as it avoided interference from engineers, producers and the record company. He noted: \\"You're down there by yourself, creating what you want to create, and that's the way it comes out. The best thing about it is, once you have all that equipment, you can just save so much money in studio time.\\" Avsec also spoke of the studio work in the AOR Basement interview: \\"I think next time I'll do all the sequencing in 'The Cellar' and then go to a 24-track studio to do the vocals. For \\"Samantha\\", we went back to a studio called Jeree Studios with an engineer called Jerry Reed who went through the bulk of the Cruisers days with me and Donnie. I credit that studio with the distinctive vocal sounds we got on the Cruisers' LPs, I've never found another studio where I can get the same sound - I'm a real freak for the vocals!\\" Release The album was released on vinyl and cassette in America only, via CBS Associated Records. It was also manufactured and distributed by the same label. To date it has not been released on CD, and has remained out-of-print since its original release. Track listing Critical reception Upon release, Billboard stated: \\"Despite the Beatles-esque name, this two-man outfit plays solidly soulful synthpop with no shortage of radiowise hooks. Programmers should look into \\"Samantha\\" and \\"Heartzone\\".\\" Cash Box listed the album as one of their feature picks of March 1988 and commented: \\"Cleveland-based outfit are gaining strong response due to the LP's first single, \\"Samantha,\\" which is currently obtaining impressive attention at radio.\\" Steve \\"Spaz\\" Schnee of AllMusic spoke of the album in a retrospective write-up of the Cellarful of Noise's biography: \\"Three years after the first album, the long-delayed sophomore release, Magnificent Obsession, finally appeared with a bigger, beefier sound and with Iris on board, singing lead on about half the album, including the fabulous opener \\"Samantha (What You Gonna Do?).\\" Though the album was made for the times, the general public never got a chance to hear it.\\" In AOR Basement, writer Ian McIntosh stated \\"If you haven't heard the Magnificent Obsession LP, then I heartily recommend it although it is far more overtly poppy than the majority of the old Cruisers material. The songs are as strong as ever and it makes a perfect companion for the classic King Cool LP.\\" Personnel * Mark Avsec - all musical instruments, lead vocals, background vocals, producer, engineering, mixing * Donnie Iris - lead vocals, background vocals, mixing * Marty Lee - guitar (tracks 6, 8-9), DX7 Clavinet (track 7) * Alan Greene - guitar (track 1) * Ted Hayton - mixing, remix engineering * Jack Skinner - mastering * Jerry Reed - vocal engineer (track 1) * James DeMain - guitar engineer (track 1) * Joe Barbaria - digital transfer, mixing (track 1) * Ed Avsec - studio maintenance * Belkin Personal Management - management * Stacy Drummond - art direction, design * Sandra Haber - photography References Category:1988 albums Category:CBS Records albums ","title":"Magnificent Obsession (album)"},{"id":"44544618","text":"Helga the Fair was an Icelandic woman whose life and relationships are described in Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu. She is the daughter of √ûorsteinn Egilsson and his wife Jofrid and is the granddaughter of Egill Skallagr√≠msson. Helga is trapped in a love triangle with Gunnlaugr Ormstunga and Hrafn √ñnundarson, which eventually leads to the men‚Äôs deaths.  Life  Before Helga‚Äôs birth, her father has a dream in which two eagles fight and kill each other over a swan. A hawk then comes to the swan and the two fly off together. Thorstein recounts this dream to a Norwegian and the Norwegian interprets the dream to mean that two noble men will come to fight for the hand of Thorstein‚Äôs future daughter, killing each other in the process. His daughter will then eventually remarry. Thorstein decides that if his wife has a baby girl, she must leave the child to die of exposure, so this prophecy does not come to pass. Thorstein then travels to the Althing and Jofrid has a shepherd girl, Thorvard, take the baby to Egil‚Äôs daughter, and Helga‚Äôs aunt, Thorgerd at Hjardarholt. Six years later, Thorstein is at Hjardarholt for a feast and Thorgerd reveals that one of the girls at the feast is in fact his daughter, Helga. She receives the name Helga the Fair for her exceptional beauty. Thorstein then takes Helga home to his farm at Borg and she was ‚Äúcherished by her father and mother and all her relatives.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent- Tongue,‚Äù in The Sagas of the Icelanders, trans.

Six years after this, Gunnlaug comes to Thorstein‚Äôs farm after an argument with his father, where he stays for one year, becoming Helga‚Äôs playmate and friend. Helga was said to have been the most beautiful woman there had ever been in Iceland. ‚ÄúShe had such long hair that it could cover her completely, and it was radiant as beaten gold.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue,‚Äù in The Sagas of the Icelanders, trans. Katrina C. Attwood, ed. √ñrn√≥lfur Thorsson (New York: Penguin Group, 2001), 566. Gunnlaug eventually seeks Helga‚Äôs hand in marriage, and has his father Illugi request Helga‚Äôs hand for him from Thorstein. Thorstein agrees to promise ‚Äì but not formally betroth ‚Äì Helga to Gunnlaug for three years while Gunnlaug goes abroad. After those three years, both Helga and Thorstein would be freed from any obligation regarding the marriage. Gunnlaug travels abroad, and Helga waits for him. At the Althing, Hrafn requests Helga‚Äôs hand, and Thorstein decides that if Gunnlaug has not return by the summer, Hrafn and Helga would be married at Borg at the Winter Nights, but neither Thorstein nor Helga would be obligated to Hrafn if Gunnlaug returned before then. ‚ÄúHelga did not like the arrangement at all.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue,‚Äù in The Sagas of the Icelanders, trans.

Gunnlaug, meanwhile, is forced by honor to stay at the court of King Ethelred, which costs him Helga to his rival Hrafn. Because Gunnlaug has not returned, Hrafn and Helga are married, but ‚Äúmost people say that the bride was rather gloomy‚Äù.‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue,‚Äù in The Sagas of the Icelanders, trans. Katrina C. Attwood, ed. √ñrn√≥lfur Thorsson (New York: Penguin Group, 2001), 582. Hrafn and Helga then move to Mosfell. One night, Hrafn has a dream and describes it to Helga, as it depicts his murder. Helga says she would not be upset if it were to come true, as she had been tricked into this marriage. Gunnlaug returns to Iceland, and Helga and Hrafn‚Äôs marriage become strained. The two do not enjoy intimacy after that. At a wedding, Helga gives meaningful looks to Gunnlaug, and Gunnlaug gives Helga a cloak that King Ethelred gave him as a gift to Helga. Gunnlaug and Hrafn get into an argument and decide to duel for Helga. Each rival kills one another. After some time has passed, Thorstein marries Helga to Thorkel Hallkelsson, but she does not love him, although they had several children together. She truly loved Gunnlaug and spent the rest of her life mourning him. ‚ÄúHelga‚Äôs greatest pleasure was to unfold the cloak which Gunnlaug had given her and stare at it for a long time.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue,‚Äù in The Sagas of the Icelanders, trans.

Helga becomes ill, and sits with her head on Thorkel‚Äôs lap with Gunnlaug‚Äôs cloak spread in front of her, staring at it. She then died in Thorkel‚Äôs arms. Helga was taken to the church to be buried, and Thorkel was very grieved by her death.  Footnotes   References  * ‚ÄúThe Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue.‚Äù In The Sagas of the Icelanders.

He was executed in 2008 in Huntsville, Texas, becoming the 1128th murderer to be executed in the United States since 1976. He was the 13th murderer executed in Texas in 2008 and the 418th murderer executed in Texas since 1976.  The case  On March 23, 1995 in Hockley, Texas, Nicole Benton disappeared during a birthday party held for her father, Buddy Benton, at the house of a friend. Eric Nenno lived a few houses down the road in a house owned by relatives. As Buddy was playing with his country music band, Nenno lured Nicole, who was playing in the front yard, to his home on the pretense of getting a guitar to join the group. The moment Nenno and Nicole were inside his home he struggled to rape her. As Nicole cried and resisted, he strangled her to death. He raped her lifeless body for several days and hid her corpse in his attic, stuffing her clothing in a filing cabinet. Nicole's polka-dot dress, glasses, and shoes were later found in this cabinet. A few days after Nicole's disappearance, law enforcement agents showed up at Nenno's residence to question him. Neighbors had told Detective Johnson that Nenno, a former plumbing supply salesman, had been accused of groping a six-year-old neighborhood girl two years before. Johnson then referred Nenno to Detectives Wedgeworth and Taber for a follow-up investigation, and they visited Nenno's house at 17602 Bullis Gap three times on the afternoon of March 25, 1995. On two occasions Nenno did not answer the door. On the third occasion, Nenno, dressed only in a white bath-towel around his waist, finally answered the door. Nenno indicated that he was willing to talk about the missing girl, and invited the detectives to enter the house. He seemed very cooperative and willing to speak. When the detectives asked him whether he knew Nicole, he became visibly nervous and shaky, and denied knowing or ever seeing her before. Nenno then allowed the detectives to search his house. Detective Wedgeworth conducted a brief search, but found nothing out of the ordinary. The detectives asked Nenno why someone in the neighborhood would suggest that he be checked out. He replied that there had been an incident in the spring when he was accused of trying to lure a girl into his house and pull off her pants. After this question, Nenno became visibly shaken and much more nervous. The two detectives had been at Nenno's house for approximately ten minutes, and before leaving, asked him if he would go to the command post for further questioning. After signing a legal release, Nenno stated he had no problem with that. Police informed him that a trailer had been set up several blocks away as a command post during the ongoing search for Nicole by law enforcement and volunteers from the community of Hockley. Wedgeworth and Taber later stated that they made no promises or threats to Nenno during this initial encounter. After dressing, Nenno showed up a few minutes later at the command post and Detective Taber read Nenno his Miranda rights. Taber asked Nenno if he understood his rights and he indicated that he did. Taber then asked him if he wanted to waive his rights and talk about the missing girl; he agreed to talk to the detectives. He appeared to understand the interview process which was conducted in a very moderate tone. Taber spoke with Nenno for almost an hour, and during the interview he was offered food and drink. From the start of the interview, Detective Taber reminded Nenno that he was not under arrest, and could leave at any time. When Detective Taber asked Nenno if he knew why he was there, he replied: ‚ÄúYou think I'm a suspect in the missing little girl's case‚Äù. Taber then asked him why he thought that he would be considered a suspect. Nenno replied that it was because of a past incident when he had lured a little girl to his residence and removed her pants, and because he liked children. When asked what he had done the night Nicole had disappeared, he stated that he had arrived home, changed clothes, gone outside and talked to his neighbor, and then went back inside. Nenno said he had been drinking a six-pack of beer. When asked if there was any reason why a neighbor would say that they had seen him on the same street where Nicole had disappeared, Nenno responded: ‚ÄúWell, maybe I could have been outside my house by the fence, but I just don't remember‚Äù. Taber asked Nenno the same question again and he replied: ‚ÄúWell, it might have been possible but I don't remember‚Äù. After a polygraph, authorities remained silent for several minutes, prompting Nenno to finally say: \\"I failed it, didn't I?‚Ä≥ When the examiner told Nenno he needed to disclose the girl's location, Nenno said: \\"I think she's still in the attic‚Ä≥. He then said: \\"They're going to kill me for this, aren't they?\\" Finally Nenno gave written authorization to law enforcement to search his home. During the search of Nenno's house, Nicole's body was found and Nenno was arrested. Nicole had been choked to death and raped repeatedly. In his confession, Nenno admitted to having sexual visions of young girls for most of his life, as well raping and strangling Nicole in his bedroom.  Sentencing  On February 1, 1996 the Harris County jury, that heard the case, deliberated for about 11 hours, before deciding on the death penalty for Eric Nenno. In an interview from death row one week before his scheduled execution, Nenno said that, at the time of the killing, he was addicted to pornography and had been drinking. He also said that nothing could excuse his crime. \\"I can't apologize enough\\", he said.  Procedural history  On January 18, 1996 a Harris County jury convicted Nenno of capital murder; he was sentenced to death by the District Court in Harris County on February 1st. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Nenno's conviction and sentence on June 24, 1998. Nenno filed an application for state habeas corpus on October 16, 1998 but was denied relief on November 14, 2001. Nenno petitioned the federal courts for writ of habeas corpus relief on October 18, 2002; the federal district court dismissed Nenno's case without prejudice on January 13, 2004. Nenno filed a successive application for state habeas corpus relief on February 11, 2004 which was dismissed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals June 23, 2004. On August 10, 2004 Nenno returned to federal court, and petitioned for habeas relief. On March 7, 2006 the U.S. District Court denied habeas relief, and denied a COA. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied his application for a COA on June 6, 2007. On March 24, 2008 the U. S. Supreme Court denied certiorari review. On June 10, 2008, Nenno petitioned for clemency with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.  Execution  On October 28, 2008, Eric Charles Nenno, was executed by lethal injection in Huntsville Unit in Texas. Nenno did not look at Buddy Benton or the other members of the victim's family who attended his execution. When asked if he wanted to make a last statement, he replied, \\"No, warden.\\" The lethal injection was then started. He gasped four times and eight minutes later at 6:20 p.m., Nenno was pronounced dead.  Final meal  His last meal was a grilled cheeseburger, four fish patties, six hard boiled eggs and some coffee.

The actor was initially hesitant about joining the show, as he had been about to secure a record contract. He made his first screen appearance on 10 September 1991. A few months later, Williams decided to leave Neighbours as he felt unfulfilled by the role. He also wanted more time to pursue his music career. Guy departed on 27 March 1992. Williams reprised his role for one episode as part of the show's 30th anniversary on 18 March 2015. Guy was portrayed as a handsome, sporty, ladies' man. Williams said there were aspects of Guy's personality he could relate to, especially their search for \\"Miss Right\\". Upon his introduction, Guy was estranged from his father, Lou (Tom Oliver). When Lou returned to Erinsborough, he and Guy made their peace with each other. During his time in the show, Guy took steroids, tried dating three women at once and had a brief romance with Gaby Willis (Rachel Blakely). Television critics branded the character a \\"heart throb\\" and \\"a charming rogue\\". Casting Andrew Williams joined the cast of Neighbours as Guy after failing to secure a record contract. He almost rejected the role and explained, \\"I was still in music mode and I thought Kylie, Jason, Craig... not me, no way\\". A few months after joining Neighbours, Williams decided to leave. He said the show was not what he was after and wanted to continue pursuing a career in music, which he found he did not have time to do during his time on Neighbours. He added, \\"I guess I felt a little bit unfulfilled for that.\\" In March 1996, Inside Soap's Jason Herbison reported that Channel 10 were keen on keeping actor Vince Poletto on the network, and were considering casting him as Guy, as Williams was unlikely to return to the serial. Development Guy grew estranged from his father, Lou (Tom Oliver), following his divorce from Guy's mother, Kathy (Tina Bursill).Monroe 1994, p.42. Guy came to Erinsborough to stay with his aunt, Brenda Riley (Genevieve Lemon). They co-manage the local coffee shop and have fun romancing their neighbours. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First Ten Years, said Guy's \\"good looks and way with the cappuccino machine in the Coffee Shop set his female customers' heart aflutter.\\"Monroe 1996, p.33. The BBC's official Neighbours website described Guy as being \\"a ladies man\\" much like his father. They also thought that Guy took steroids to win a race, due to the \\"competitive nature\\" of his relationship with his father, who often expected too much from him. Williams said there were parts of Guy that he could relate to, especially their sporty sides and that they were both looking for \\"Miss Right\\". Reinforcing his ladies man reputation, Guy tried dating three women ‚Äì Gaby Willis (Rachel Blakely), Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and Caroline Alessi (Gillian Blakeney) ‚Äì at the same time and they soon found out. He later became close to Gaby and they had a brief romance. Discussing Guy and Gaby's first kiss, Williams told a reporter from BIG! magazine that \\"there was nothing in it really - it was just a screen kiss. I knew her real-life husband very well so it was just like kissing a friend's wife.\\" Following an argument with her boyfriend Glen Donnelly (Richard Huggett), Gaby ran off with Guy. However, she was not serious about him and she later returned to Glen when he proposed to her. Guy was \\"very hurt\\" when he learned the news, as he cared a lot for Gaby and would have liked her to tell him. Guy was reunited with his father when Lou returned to town, and the two made their peace with each other.

However, Brenda tells Guy that he cannot stay with her as the house she is leasing belongs to Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), who does not like Lou and may not want his son staying there. Guy spends a night sleeping on the floor of the Coffee Shop, and after Harold leaves town, Guy moves in with Brenda. Guy begins working at the Coffee Shop, where he flirts with the female customers. Guy arranges dates with Gaby Willis, Lucy Robinson and Caroline Alessi at the same time, but he is soon caught out and forced to apologise to them.

Brad asks his mother, Pam (Sue Jones), a nurse, for advice and she tells Brenda, who confronts Guy. When she threatens to take some of the steroids herself, Guy agrees to give them up. He ends up winning the cross-country run. When Brad's surfboards are stolen, Guy comes under suspicion when his half-coin pendant is found nearby. Gaby confronts Guy, but he assures her he did not take the surfboards. He also explains that the pendant was given to him by a woman he had gone on a date with. She had kept hold of the other half and Brad realises she was involved in the robbery. Guy later recognises the woman as Paige Sneddon (Tracy Callander), Brad's boss and girlfriend. Guy struggles to tell Brad and tries asking Paige out on a date in a bid to get the truth about the robbery out of her. Brad catches Guy and accuses him of trying to steal his girlfriend. Gaby shows an interest in Guy again, but he realises she is only using him to get back at her ex-boyfriend, Glen. However, Guy ends up asking Gaby to dinner and develops strong feelings for her. Glen proposes to Gaby and she accepts, and Guy finds out the news from Pam and is upset that Gaby did not tell him herself. Guy starts working at the local swimming pool as a recreation officer, but soon clashes with his boss, Sid Butcher (Timothy Bell). After a confrontation with Sid, Guy quits his job. Brenda intervenes and tells Sid that Guy was upset about the death of his dog. Sid offers Guy his job back. Lou arrives in town and he and Guy try to repair their relationship. Lou initially avoids talking about their issues and only shows interest in Guy's sporting achievements. But they manage to sort things out and Lou tells Guy that he loves him.

The Cougars play their home matches on Bob Guelker Field at Ralph Korte Stadium located in the southwest corner of the SIUE campus in Edwardsville, Illinois. Derek Burton has been head coach since 2008. History Sources:' The program was begun by Lori Stark in 1981 as a club team and was elevated to varsity status the following year. Stark departed after the 1983 season and was replaced by a series of co-head coaches. In 1984 & '85, the program was led by Mike Kelly and head softball coach Cindy Jones. Jones was replaced in 1986 by Ed Huneke, who also became the new men's head coach. Kelly left after five seasons and was replaced in 1989 by Brian Korbesmeyer. In 1990, Korbesmeyer became the sole head coach, a position he held through 2002, leading the Cougars to two Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) titles and three trips to the NCAA Division II Women's Soccer Championship tournament. Cougar alumna Lynda Bowers became head coach in 2003 and led the Cougars to two more GLVC championships and two more trips to the NCAA tournament before leaving the program after the 2007 season to pursue a career in the ministry as the university was ready to begin the transition to Division I. Derek Burton assumed the reins of the program in 2008 and led it into Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). In 2014, Burton's Cougars tied for the regular season OVC championship, then won the conference tournament to become the school's first entry in the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship. Playing at heavily favored Kentucky, the Cougars held the Wildcats to a scoreless tie through regulation time and two extra periods before falling on penalty kicks. The 2016 squad finished the regular season in 4th place with a record of only 8‚Äì7‚Äì4 (6‚Äì3‚Äì1 OVC). They got through the first round of the OVC tournament by besting Austin Peay on penalty kicks 5‚Äì4, sending them to the semifinals at top-seeded Murray State. The Racers had not lost on their home field since October 2014, but the Cougars took the victory 2‚Äì1 with 11 seconds left in the first overtime period. In the tourney final, they faced co-champions Eastern Kentucky. The Cougars scored early, then successfully argued that the referee had not let the goalkeeper get set on a penalty kick. Goalkeeper Juli Rossi blocked the re-try, and SIUE then held on to win 1‚Äì0 for their second title in three years.

The reservoir was built between the years 1933 to 1939 with the name Turawa Stausee, to regulate the height of the water in the river Oder and for recreational purposes. Due to this the settlements of Zamo≈õcie (German Hinterbrueck), Krzy≈õlina (German Krysline), the hamlet of ≈Åuk, Pustk√≥w and Szczedrzyk were destroyed and new villages were built around the reservoir to serve for tourist purposes; the hamlet Szczedrzyk had been rebuilt around the South of the reservoir with the road Opolska connecting and circulating around the reservoir. Several families were relocated and given compensation or have been offered houses in the nearby Ligota Turawska. In addition to the river Ma≈Ça Panew a smaller river Libawa leaves the reservoir. At the outflow from the reservoir there is a hydroelectric plant with the power of 1.2 MW. Northern and southern parts of the reservoir have beaches which are surrounded by pine forests with many holiday resorts. The reservoir is also popular with water sports. Near the reservoir are other lakes. Lake ≈örednie and Ma≈Çe (both are to the South of reservoir) which are the result of gravel extraction sites used in the construction of the dam at the reservoir.

Before joining her current club she played for Link√∂pings FC, Eskilstuna United DFF and Kristianstads DFF of the Damallsvenskan, spent a season in England with FA WSL club Chelsea Ladies. She won her first cap for the Sweden women's national football team in November 2014. She has previously worn the name Maredinho on her shirt, a nickname originally given by her father in homage to male footballer Ronaldinho. Club career In 2012 Banu≈°iƒá scored 16 goals for Norrettan club IK Sirius and became a transfer target for clubs in the Damallsvenskan, Sweden's top division. Banu≈°iƒá made a favourable early impression after signing for Kristianstads in 2013. Teammate and fellow Uppsala-native Josefine √ñqvist called her a potential \\"v√§rldsspelare\\" (), while coach El√≠sabet Gunnarsd√≥ttir declared her the biggest talent in the history of Swedish women's football. Banu≈°iƒá gave Kristianstads the lead in the 2014 Svenska Cupen () final, but they were defeated 2‚Äì1 by Link√∂pings FC. After the season she decided to leave Kristianstads and returned to Uppsala, where she considered several offers from other clubs from Sweden and abroad. Banu≈°iƒá agreed a transfer to London-based FA WSL club Chelsea Ladies in January 2015. With Chelsea Banu≈°iƒá started three of her eight league appearances as the club won the 2015 FA WSL title. She was an unused substitute in Chelsea's 1‚Äì0 win over Notts County at the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final, staged at Wembley Stadium for the first time. Banu≈°iƒá had fallen further down the pecking order when Chelsea broke the British transfer record to sign Fran Kirby during the season. In December 2015 Banu≈°iƒá announced that she would return to Sweden to play for Damallsvenskan club Eskilstuna United DFF in 2016. International career In June 2013 Banu≈°iƒá was named in senior national team coach Pia Sundhage's squad for a 1‚Äì1 friendly draw with Brazil. She was hopeful of a surprise call-up to Sweden's UEFA Women's Euro 2013 squad, but was not selected and went to the 2013 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship instead. In November 2014 Banu≈°iƒá made her senior Sweden debut against Canada in Los Angeles. The match, which finished in a 1‚Äì0 defeat, was played behind closed doors but still counted as a full FIFA international fixture. Banu≈°iƒá was disappointed with the result but satisfied with her performance after coming on as a second-half substitute. She hoped to stay in contention for a place at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Altmann was the son of Karoline Keile (Tischler) and Karl Chaskel Altmann.Karoline Keile (Tischler) and Karl Chaskel Altmann His family was Jewish. He entered the textile trade in Vienna in 1915, and in 1919 founded his knitwear manufacturing business. His company grew to employ 1000 people by 1938 before the German Anschluss forced him to flee to London. His brother Fritz Altmann - husband of Jewish refugee Maria Altmann, who made her living in America after the war selling Bernhard's cashmere sweaters - was taken prisoner by the Nazis and Bernhard was forced to sign over the business in return for Fritz's release from Dachau Concentration Camp. Altmann started a factory in Liverpool in 1938, which he had to abandon in 1939 as a result of The Blitz and the UK Enemy alien Act of 1939, in which all nationals of enemy countries had to withdraw from coastline cities in three days after the declaration of war. After Liverpool he immigrated to the United States, where he started a company in Fall River, Massachusetts. After two years he lost control of his assets. In 1941 Altmann moved to New York City, where he took a job at $50 a week. The cashmere business started in North America in 1947 when Altmann added the cashmere fiber line; he subsequently opened a factory in Texas. By 1951 it was reported that one in every three cashmere sweaters sold in America came from Altmann's Texas mill. Altmann also produced clothes in Shetland wool, vicuna and a lambswool/fur fibre blend called \\"Bernamere\\".

It is native to Central and South America. It was first described by the Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1804. Behaviour Priochilus captivum is a solitary wasp and often nests on or around human habitations. Nesting sites chosen include among the folds of clothing, inside shoes, in cardboard boxes, behind books on shelves and in brick cavities. One female started nesting among bedclothes while the researcher was napping. The nest consists of a number of individual cells and is built of pieces of dry twigs and bits of gravel cemented together with mud. The number of cells in the nest ranges from two to seven. In Brazil, the nests are camouflaged with grass seeds, leaf fragments, animal hairs and insect remains, the outer walls are quite rough and the inside walls are smooth. In Trinidad, mud is the main building material and the nests are uncamouflaged. The individual cells are barrel-shaped, about long and wide. They are built on concealed horizontal surfaces and lie on their sides, touching each other, but not sharing a common wall. The female wasp captures and immobilises a spider to provision each cell in the nest. In Brazil, a species of jumping spider (Salticidae) is often used. The spider is captured and stung, then laid on the ground while the female completes the cell. The mud takes about two hours to dry, and then the spider is placed inside, an egg is laid on its abdomen and the cell is sealed. The egg soon hatches and the wasp larva grows fast. By day five it has finished eating the abdomen of its spider host and by day nine it forms a cocoon. Males emerge through the seals of the cells at about day thirty while females emerge around ten days later. Adult wasps feed on nectar and honeydew. Distribution and habitat This spider wasp is native to Central America and the northern part of South America. Its range includes the West Indies, Panama, and Brazil. In the latter country it is on the wing in the hot, rainy season, between September and April. In the laboratory, males live for about sixty days and females live for one hundred and twenty days.

In 2014, he won one minor race from his first four starts and then established himself as one of the top two-year-old colts in North America with a six and a half length win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He has unique connections, as his part-owner/trainer and his usual jockey are brothers: Keith and Kent Desormeaux. Background Texas Red is a bay colt with a white star bred in Kentucky by Stonestreet Thoroughbred Holdings. He was sired by Afleet Alex, who won the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes in 2005 when he was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. At stud, Afleet Alex has also sired Afleet Express (Travers Stakes), Afleet Again (Breeders' Cup Marathon), Iotapa (Vanity Handicap), and Dublin (Hopeful Stakes). Texas Red's dam, Ramatuelle, was a successful racemare in Chile before being sent to the United States, where she was placed in the Desert Stormer Handicap. As a descendant of the Argentinian mare Sixtina, Ramatuelle was a distant relative of several major winners including Crow. In September 2013, the yearling colt was consigned by Three Chimneys Sales to the Keeneland Sales and was bought for $17,000 by Eric Brehm on behalf of a partnership that included Keith Desormeaux, Lee Michaels, Wayne Detmar, and Gene Voss. Keith Desormeaux later commented, \\"I still don‚Äôt realize how we got him for such a price because he was a physical masterpiece even then ‚Äì very correct, very confident, very intelligent looking, all the things we look for as horsemen in trying to acquire a good animal\\". During his track career, the colt has been trained by Desormeaux and ridden in most of his races by Desormeaux's brother Kent. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Texas Red made his racing debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Arlington Park on July 3. Ridden by James Graham, he started slowly and lost several lengths but stayed on well to finish second, a neck behind the winner, Mr Lightning Boy. In a similar event over six furlongs at Del Mar twenty-four days later, he finished fourth of ten runners behind Red Button, Homer Matt, and Battle of Evermore after again starting poorly. In this race, he was ridden for the first time by his trainer's brother, Kent Desormeaux, who became his regular jockey. Texas Red recorded his first success in a maiden race at Del Mar on August 21 in which he started 3/1 second favorite behind Battle of Evermore. After racing towards the back of the field in the early stages, he moved up to second approaching the final turn. He overtook the leader, Secreto Primero, inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths. Texas Red was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over one and one sixteenth miles at Santa Anita Park on September 27. Starting a 12.5/1 outsider, he was towards the rear of the field in the early stages as usual before making steady progress in the second half of the race to finish third behind the odds-on favorite, American Pharoah, and Calculator. Over the same course and distance on November 1, Texas Red was one of eleven colts to contest the thirty-first running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. With American Pharoah ruled out by injury, the joint-favorites were Champagne Stakes winner Daredevil and Breeders' Futurity Stakes winner Carpe Diem, with Texas Red a 14/1 outsider. After his customary slow start, the colt dropped back to last place, several lengths detached from the rest of the eleven-runner field in the early stages. He began to make rapid progress approaching the final turn before moving to the outside at the top of the stretch. Texas Red took the lead inside the last quarter mile and accelerated clear of his rivals to win by six and a half lengths, with Carpe Diem taking second ahead of Upstart and Irish challenger The Great War. After the race, Kent Desormeaux said, \\"He was so far back there, there was nobody in his way until the quarter-pole, so it was a pretty uneventful trip. When I swung him out he didn‚Äôt really need much riding... once I presented him, he just bellied down and extended his stride. Full of power.\\" Commenting on his partnership with his older brother, he added, \\"We‚Äôve done it all our lives ‚Äì this is what we know. I got to ride them and stayed small, and Keith has the eye and education.\\" =2015: three-year- old season= Texas Red made his three-year-old debut in the San Vicente Stakes on February 1 at Santa Anita. Sent off as the 7/10 favorite, he was out-dueled in the stretch by Lord Nelson, losing by a neck. He was expected to make his next start in the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds on February 21 but was ruled out after developing a foot abscess. Texas Red's first workout following the foot issues occurred on March 14 at Santa Anita. Trainer and co- owner Keith Desormeaux was hoping to start the horse in the Santa Anita Derby as a prep for the Kentucky Derby but admitted at the time that he was under some pressure since Texas Red was trying to come off a month-long layoff to train for a Grade 1 Derby prep race. Three days later, owner Erich Brehm announced that Texas Red would be taken out of consideration for the Kentucky Derby, stating that there would not be enough time to prepare the horse for a race where the necessary qualifying points for a Derby start could be earned. After a five-month break, Texas Red returned in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park on July 4 and finished second, two and a half lengths behind the winner Speightster. Four weeks later the colt contested the Jim Dandy Stakes (a trial for the Travers Stakes) at Saratoga and started second favorite behind Frosted, a colt who had finished fourth in the Derby and second in the Belmont Stakes. After racing in third place he took the lead entering the straight and held off the late run of Frosted to win by half a length. Kent Desormeaux said \\"I think he can only improve. He's a huge-striding, real estate-loving kind of horse... His true superior athletic ability to get a mile and a half and a mile and a quarter is what he is best at\\".http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/93353/jim-dandy-texas-red-denies-frosted Assessment and awards In January 2015, Texas Red finished runner-up to American Pharoah in the poll for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse receiving 111 votes to his rival's 126. Retirement and stallion career Texas Red retired at the end of 2016. He stands stallion duties at Crestwood Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, with a $7,500 stud fee. Pedigree *Texas Red is inbred 3 x 4 to Nureyev, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The picture was released on June 24, 1942, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Tom O'Folliard (William Lundigan) is released from jail and seeks work at his prior employer, a stagecoach line. He is sent to manage a stagecoach rest stop in a remote area. Upon arrival, he meets a woman, Se√±ora Martinez (Connie Gilchrist) and her daughter Rosalia (Donna Reed) who cook and clean at the rest stop. When the next stage arrives, among its cargo is a strong box with cash. Soon after, Folliard's brother \\"Trigger\\" Bill Folliard (Lloyd Nolan), a known outlaw arrives and seeks shelter from the local Apaches, whom he has offended. Upon his discovery that a strong box is present, he plans to steal it and make a getaway. During Tom Folliard's absence from the rest stop, Trigger Bill gets the upper hand on the stagecoach line employees watching him and tries to escape with the proceeds but is thwarted by his brother's arrival back at the rest stop. Soon thereafter, the Apaches attack the rest stop but are repulsed. They demand Trigger Bill and in return they will leave the rest stop alone. A vote is taken by all those in the rest stop with Tom casting the deciding vote to not give his brother to the Apaches. During the next attack Bill, previously expertly shot through both hands by his brother, elects in noble fashion to sacrifice himself to save the others by riding away from the rest stop. Meanwhile, Tom, after a brief flirtation with one of the stagecoach passengers, Constance Selden (Ann Ayars), tells Se√±ora Martinez that he would like to court her daughter.

Friday 28 May 1920. Her name, Ben Seyr, came from the Manx Gaelic term for gentlewoman. She was lost in a storm in either the northern part of the Celtic Sea, or the southern part of the Irish Sea, in October 1938, going down with the loss of all hands. Construction and dimensions Ben Seyr was constructed by the Manchester Dry Docks Company at Ellesmere Port and was completed in 1920. Length , beam , depth . Ben Seyr's cargo hold was divided into fore and aft hatches with a combined space of 12,400 cubic feet and which could accommodate 265 tons of cargo. She was driven by a marine compound reciprocating engine with her boiler manufactured by Cammell Laird's. The high-pressure cylinder was 15 inches in diameter, the low-pressure cylinder 32 inches with a 21-inch stroke. Ben Seyr was fitted with a patented steam-powered steering gear designed by Fisher's of Paisley, which could be detached if necessary. She had bunker capacity for 40 tons of coal with her bunkers designed to accommodate 20 tons on the port side and the other 20 tons on the starboard side. She carried 20 tons of water ballast aft and 12 tons forward and had a tank installed which contained 300 gallons of drinking water. For a vessel of her size, her engine room was said to be exceptionally large and airy and all accessories were said to be conveniently placed. The quarters of the seamen and firemen were situated forward, underneath the forecastle head. Below the wheel house was the accommodation for the Captain and First mate with the Chief engineer's quarters situated at the after end of the ship. The fittings were made of oak and she was furnished with spring beds. Ben Seyr was fitted with a steam- powered windlass and in addition a steam winch for loading and unloading of cargo. Service life Ben Seyr underwent her Sea Trials in early May 1920 during the course of which she covered a measured mile off Formby at a speed of . Ben Seyr entered service under the command of Captain E. Jones, who prior to this had served on the Ben Varrey. On her maiden voyage she made passage from the Bar Lightship to Maughold Head in a time of 6.5 hours. On joining the Ramsey Steamship Company fleet she was the largest vessel within the fleet and brought the total number to five. Ben Seyr conveyed numerous types of cargo, with the mainstays being coal, grain and timber. Incidents With Captain Corlett in command, the Ben Seyr was approaching Ramsey Harbour on Friday, February 7, 1936, in challenging conditions. A southeasterly gale had developed making berthing in the port particularly difficult and leading to one of the Ben Seyr's ropes snapping following which she began to drift onto the Mooragh bank. Capt. Corlett displayed fine seamanship in raging control of the vessel and averting her grounding.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, February 14, 1936; Page: 6 In August 1937, one of the crew of the Ben Seyr was drowned in Maryport Harbour following an accident.The Ramsey Courier. Friday 14 October 1938. Able Seaman Charles Kneale was 23 years old and came from Ramsey, Isle of Man. He was in a small boat sculling across the harbour together with another crew member Able Seaman Cecil Barber near to where the Ben Seyr was docked. In testimony Barber said that as they approached the dock gates Kneale fell into the water and although Barber did all he could to save him, he subsequently drowned. An inquest into Kneale's death was held later that night on board the Ben Seyr in order to allow the vessel to sail on the night tide. The Ben Seyr conveyed the body of Able Seaman Kneale back to Ramsey. Loss Ben Seyr departed Ramsey on Sunday, 2 October 1938 under Captain Ambrose Crebbin, bound for Cardiff with a cargo of oats. During the course of the passage, she encountered heavy seas and was forced to run towards the Irish Coast in order to seek shelter, with word being received by her owners on the morning of Wednesday 5, that she had arrived off Rosslare, County Wexford. The Station Master at Rosslare reported that the Ben Seyr had departed at 14:00hrs later that day resuming passage to Cardiff,The Ramsey Courier. Friday 14 October 1938 after which nothing more was seen or heard from her. Ben Seyr was not equipped with a wireless and therefore no information was received regarding her position or the weather which she was encountering. By the following Tuesday, 11 October, with still no news of the Ben Seyr, the following radio appeal was made on the BBC National Programme as well as on Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. When Wednesday came with still no news of the Ben Seyr hope began to fade. It seemed highly improbable that she could still be sheltering, for her crew had with them food for approximately five days and her coal bunkers would have been running out. On Thursday 13 October the body of Seaman James Bradford was washed ashore on Middleton Sands, near Heysham Harbour on the Lancashire Coast.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 14 October 1938 His body was found fully clothed and in a standard type life jacket. Within his coat was found a badge of the Isle of Man Branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union to which he belonged. He was formerly identified by his by his father,Green Final. Saturday 15 October 1938 and an inquest was held into his death at Heysham on Saturday 15 October.Green Final. Saturday 15 October 1938 James Bradford's body was returned to the Isle of Man on board the steamer Mona's Isle. Following his funeral which was reported to have been very well attended, his body was buried at Maughold Churchyard.Green Final. Saturday 15 October 1938 A relief fund for the dependents of the crew was set up on 18 October 1938. The fund raised a total of ¬£1,387 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) added to which was the sum of ¬£400 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) from the Ramsey Steamship Company. During the years following, payments were made to the dependents at Christmas (¬£30) with financial aid also being given for medical and educational purposes. The relief fund continued to pay those dependents until 1955, when with the children of the dependents having grown into adulthood it was decided that the Ben Seyr Relief Fund should be wound up. A meeting was called by the Trustees at the Town Hall, Ramsey, on Monday 17 January 1955, for the purpose of passing a resolution for the winding up of the fund and distributing the balance amongst the last five dependents.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 7 January 1955. Theories on sinking How the Ben Seyr met her fate is a matter of conjecture. Having been seen at Rosslare, it may be presumed that having sailed for Cardiff on Wednesday afternoon she soon encountered heavy seas. Her cargo of loose oats may have run forward in the hold, the weight putting her nose under the water, in which case she could have sunk in a matter of minutes. Conversely, she may have attempted to turn back and run for the shelter of the Irish Coast during the course of which she was swamped by the heavy seas - again her sinking would have followed quickly. The fact that the body of Seaman James Bradford was washed ashore on the northern part of the Lancashire Coast, could also support a theory that after leaving Rosslare the Ben Seyr \\"ran before the storm\\" in an attempt to return to the Isle of Man. Local nautical theory at the time suggested this as a possibility, with the Ben Seyr subsequently foundering to the south of the Isle of Man. Also with the fact that Bradford's body was found in a life jacket, it could suggest that the crew abandoned ship, however no other crew members bodies were found. Several days after she had left Rosslare rumours began to circulate that one of the Ben Seyr's lifeboats had been recovered on the Irish Coast. However, it turned out to be a lifeboat belonging to the SS Donaghmnore of Belfast, which had gone to the rescue of the SS Marjorie which was lost in the same storm off St. John's Point, Ireland. Wreckage of the Marjorie was also washed up on the western coast of the Isle of Man.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 28 October 1938. In August 1939, it was announced by the Board of Trade that after careful consideration of all the facts surrounding the loss of the Ben Seyr that it had been decided that there were no public grounds for the carrying out of a formal investigation into the case.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 18 August 1939. Trivia In early March 1939, a message in a bottle was washed up on the shore at Silecroft, southern Cumberland on which was written: Green Final Saturday 11 March 1939 The message was regarded with some reserve. There was only one set of hatches on the Ben Seyr and if the word \\"Maughull\\" was supposed to mean Maughold, then it is highly unlikely that it would have been mis-spelt by any member of the crew in the manner indicated. Also the position indicated in the message would have put the vessel somewhere between Langness and the Chicken Rock.

It is not known when it was performed.C. van Zwol, pp. 711-712 Why Bruckner has chosen this unsound text for the name-day of his Maecenas remains unexplained. Perhaps he has put so into music his resignation following his father's death or Aloisia Bogner's refusal of his proposal of marriage.The 16-year old Aloisia Bogner, alias Louise or Luise Bogner, was the older daughter of Micha√´l Bogner, by whom Bruckner had a living accommodation.

Analysis of remains during the 1940s determined that the wooden tray was of ash, and that there may have been a feather trim to the helmet. The first technical report on the helmets was published by Norling-Christensen in 1946. It is thought that the Br√∏ns Mose was a lake in the Bronze Age, and an extension of the modern L√∏ged S√∏ waterbody - making the helmets a likely bog votive offering. Radiocarbon dating place the wooden trays associated with the helmets to an earlier date than the helmets. Additionally shards of broken pots were found above the helmets, but may not be an associated deposit. Design and construction Two helmets were found, almost identical in design - the primary material was a high tin bronze (16.8%) with small amounts of lead, arsenic, antimony, and nickel (all 0.1 to 1%) and traces of silver (~0.05%). Stylistically the hemispherical main part resembles the plain textile hats of the period as well as Urnfield metal helmets - the hemispheres were made from two hammered pieces joined with rivets in a seam running front to back across the top, with a heavy joining rim or crest across the top - either end of the crest ended in a downpointing 'hook' possibly intended to recall the beak of a raptor. Ornamentation included bosses across the surface of various sizes, including two larger 'eye' positioned bosses, together with eyebrows. A row of bosses along the lower rim each terminate in a 'S'-shaped (or Swan shaped) ornamentation - thus resembling double-sterned-ships. (Vogelsonnenbarken). The helmet's horns are also 'S'-shaped, with a twist recalling both a bull's horns and the twist in a pair of lurs. Fittings between horns and crest held bird's feathers, and it has been suggested that the crest was originally adorned with a hair. The helmet has a human appearance coupled with select zoomorphic elements. Overall the design takes cues from both Urnfield and Nordic culture, though some elements, such as bulls' horns are found elsewhere - such as Iberia, and Sardinia, and horned helms are also seen in contemporary descriptions of the Sea Peoples in the Mediterranean and near East. Vandkilde states the helmet is thought to have been made in Scandinavia, using European bronze working techniques, though others suggest the helmet was imported from Italy. The shape of the horns suggest the Italian long-horn cattle, a subtype of the species Bos primigenius (the aurochs). Meaning, use, and significance 'Twin' helmets were found - in some interpretations of Bronze Age beliefs the sun can be represented by 'twin gods'. Other interpretations place a significance as the helmets being representation of weapons or war, or some relation to the Proto-Indo-European religion myth of Divine twins. Alternatively the helmets have been interpreted as a heirloom, or possibly conferring some status or importance when worn. Ritualistic use, either giving powers from, or connection to the animal or godly world has also been suggested. The found position (ie in a bog or former water body) also places the final use of the helmets within the class of votive offerings. Similar artifacts Figures of twins with horns from a similar period and region are known - these included bronze figurines wearing horned helments found at Grevensv√¶nge (Grevensv√¶nge figurines), and horned twins of a horse's yoke found at Fogdarp. Related horned imagery has also been found on razors (Vestrup razor), and rock-carvings from a similar place/period. See also *Sutton Hoo helmet, a later 7th C.

Among his associates there were Giovanni Battista Castagneto, Ant√¥nio Parreiras, Domingo Garc√≠a y V√°squez and Grimm's friend from Germany, Thomas Georg Driendl. In 1884, he won a Gold Medal at the Exposi√ß√£o Geral de Belas Artes. The following year, thanks to financial assistance from his family, he was able to visit France, where he studied with the landscape painter Hector Hanoteau.Brasil Artes Enciclop√©dias: Grupo Grimm. He remained there for three years, travelling throughout Brittany and Normandy. Upon his return, he toured Minas Gerais and received several commissions for decorations, including murals at the old theater in Juiz de Fora and the newspaper offices of O Farol (The Beacon). From 1890 to 1891, he lived in Sabar√°, which had briefly been the home of his mentor, Grimm. Continuing to travel between Minas Gerais and Juiz de Fora, working on commissions, he returned from one trip ill with yellow fever and died soon after. References Further reading * .

Initially the concept of psychic damage was used to describe the effects of stigmatization on African-Americans, but the concept has also been applied to other stigmatized groups, such as Native Americans, Latino people and women.

For example, prophets were foreordained to be the Lord's servants, all who receive the priesthood were foreordained to that calling, and Jesus Christ was foreordained to enact the atonement. Unlike predestination, foreordination allows for individual agency (the ability to choose whether to fulfil one's callings). Teachings Foreordination is a prominent part of LDS theology. Brigham Young, the first LDS Church leader to explain it, taught that God's omniscient foreknowledge does not constitute a divine decree.http://jod.mrm.org/6/93 Unlike predestination, foreordination does not exclude free will. LDS Church members believe part of one's mission in life is choosing to fulfill what one was foreordained to do,http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/thou-wast-chosen-before- thou-wast-born-abraham-3-moses-41-4/#fn2-3063 following the example of Jesus Christ who actively chose to complete the atonement he was foreordained to enact. The word \\"foreordination\\" appears in the King James Version of the First Epistle of Peter 1:20, \\"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you\\". The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The LDS Church has understood this to be a depiction of Christ's foreordination.1 Peter The church also teaches that foreordination is referenced in the Old Testament in the first chapter of the Book of Jeremiah, verse 5 (\\"before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet\\").Jeremiah The church also teaches that during the war in heaven the spirits that followed Christ were not equally valiant. The more diligent ones were made to be rulers. The Book of Abraham teaches that in the pre-mortal existence some spirits were more intelligent than others.Abraham The church teaches that foreordination can be a reward for valiant commitment to Jesus Christ and may influence one's earthly circumstances. Birth into one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel is seen as a birthright of dedicated souls. Those who are virtuous and great in this life attained greater intelligence and nobility in the pre-mortal existence. However, everyone can be adopted into one of the twelve tribes of Israel through faithfulness on Earth, regardless of their foreordination. =Time of birth= In 1918, Joseph F. Smith said he received a vision, in which he was told choice spirits were reserved to be born during the founding of the LDS Church, including Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Wilford Woodruff, and that they received lessons in the spirit world and were prepared to be rulers in the LDS Church. This was later adapted as the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants.Doctrine and Covenants In a 1977 speech, Ezra Taft Benson told the young people of the church that \\"You are choice spirits, many of you having been held back in reserve for almost 6,000 years to come forth in this day.\\" In 1986, he told young men and women that \\"Your birth at this particular time was foreordained in the eternities.\\" These comments were later incorporated into a pamphlet for youth. In the 1990 For the Strength of Youth pamphlet, the First Presidency told Latter-day Saint youth \\"You are choice spirits who have been held in reserve to come forth in this day when the temptations, responsibilities, and opportunities are the very greatest.\\" This was part of a larger church effort to promote the peculiarity of LDS youth. The 2001 version changed the wording to remove the concept of holding in reserve, saying \\"You are choice spirits who have come forth in this day when the responsibilities and opportunities, as well as the temptations, are the greatest.\\" In 2004, the church's General Young Women President, Elaine S. Dalton, said that the current generation was among those choice spirits reserved to come to the earth. =Priesthood= The Book of Mormon teaches that those ordained to the priesthood were \\"called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works.\\"Alma, While traditionally this is interpreted as foreordination of priesthood holders, some have interpreted this to mean the standard of worthiness was foreordained rather than the priesthood holders. The Book of Abraham teaches that in the pre- mortal existence God chose certain spirits that were noble and great to be rulers.Abraham \\"Joseph Smith taught that \\"Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before this world was.\\" The church teaches that all members of the church were foreordained with significant tasks.

Retrieved on November 29, 2014 =Behavior= Like most species of damselfish, this species is territorial. At daytime, they are active. When the diurnal hours are over, they take shelter in corals to avoid getting eaten by predators. In the aquarium This species of damselfish is rarely seen in the aquarium hobby.

Eggs that failed to hatch are removed out of the spawning site. The reproduction process usually lasts for about 20 minutes. Females can lay up to 20,000 eggs each. On average, eggs take about 3 days to a week to hatch. Males sometimes spawn with more than 1 female.

The Last Post Fund‚Äôs mission is to ensure that \\"no Veteran is denied a dignified funeral and burial, as well as a military gravestone, due to insufficient funds at time of death.\\" Its primary mandate is to deliver the Veterans Affairs Canada Funeral & Burial Program which provides funeral, burial and grave marking benefits for eligible Canadian and Allied Veterans. The fund also delivers an Unmarked Grave Program which places military-style gravestones for Veterans are buried without commemoration. In addition to delivering these Programs, the Last Post Fund supports other initiatives designed to honour the memory of Canadian and Allied Veterans. The Last Post Fund National Field of Honour in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, was established in 1930. It is now the final resting place for more than 22,000 servicemen and women, and their family members. In 2009, the centennial year of the Last Post Fund, the National Field of Honour was designated as a National Historic Site by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. History Established in Montreal in 1909, the fund has grown from a private organization to a nationwide program supported by federal funds and private donations. In 1908 two Montreal police officers found a homeless man (James Daly), who they took to the hospital. The man was presumed drunk, and they staff set him to \\"sleep it off\\". Arthur Hair the head orderly of the hospital went to check on the man and saw an envelope in his pocket which he recognized as honorable discharge papers from the British War Office. Daly had served with the British military for over 20 years. Two days later Daly died (he had hypothermia and malnutrition, not drunk), as his body was unclaimed it was to be donated to research (as per standard practice). Not satisfied with what would happen to the veteran, Hair raised money to give him a proper burial at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery. The Last Post Fund was established in Montreal a year later. Initially the fund was financed through private donation, in 1921 it was incorporated and began receiving funds from the Government of Canada. Initially Catholic veterans were buried in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery whilst Protestants were buried in Mount Royal Cemetery. As the two cemeteries filled the Quebec division of the Last Post Fund purchased land in Pointe-Claire, Quebec in 1929, which they developed into the National Field of Honour, established a year later. The British Columbia board of directors currently consists of Gino Simeoni, Alistair Vigier, Beth Brown, Door Gibson, Ed Fitch, Ike Hall, Ken Usher and Jim Billinger. Service Eligibility To meet the service criteria, the deceased must be either: * A former member of the Canadian Armed Forces, or any predecessor naval, army or air forces of Canada or Newfoundland (who dies anywhere in the world); * A Canadian Merchant Navy Veteran serving in either Second World War or the Korean War; * An Allied Veteran who served with the Allied Forces during the Second World War or the Korean War and either: ** Has lived in Canada for at least 10 years; ** Lived in Canada prior to enlisting in the armed forces and was living in Canada at time of death. Financial Eligibility for the Funeral & Burial Program Once service criteria has been met, the amount of assistance that may be provided is calculated using a means test as established by Veterans Affairs Canada. The means-test is an assessment of assets and liabilities held by the estate at time of death (not on annual income). Exemptions are offered where there is a surviving spouse or dependent child. Funeral & Burial Services Under the Funeral & Burial Program Entry to the National Field of Honour Once eligibility is determined for assistance under the Funeral & Burial Program, the Last Post Fund will provide money for funeral expenses and professional services (up to $7,376 at the Funeral Home). In addition, the cost of cremation, burial expenses such as a plot and interment may be covered. Last Post Fund may also assist by arranging a military gravestone or marker as part of the benefit package for accepted cases. Applications should be made within one year of the date of death of the Veteran. Unmarked Grave Program The Last Post Fund delivers an Unmarked Grave Program (UGP) which places military-style gravestones for Veterans who have been deceased for five years or more and have no other permanent gravestone. There is no financial qualification for the Unmarked Grave Program. Budget and Allocation The Last Post Fund is financed through Veterans Affairs Canada and through private donation. For 2012/2013 the Last Post Fund had a budget of $9.5 million, of which it spent $8.6 million. The 2013 Canadian federal budget increased the amount of money one would receive for expenses at s funeral home (from $3600 to $7376), however the exemption offered in the case of married Veterans (in the means test) was not changed remaining at $36,310 in net assets (as well as the exemption of a home and vehicle). With the number of World War II and Korean War veterans steadily decreasing, the fund will be spending less money annually.

He studied art first in Palermo at the age of 13 and then in Rome at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma (Academy of Fine Arts at Rome). He immigrated to the United States in 1894 at the age of nineteen, and settled on the lower east side of Manhattan, working in many odd jobs while trying to establish himself as an artist. Currently his sculptures can be found throughout the United States and many are catalogued in the Smithsonian Institution's Research Information Service. Prominent works Miserendino became noted for his statues of Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1922 Miserendino created a larger- than-life terracotta sculpture of Roosevelt sitting on a rock in safari hunting attire, with a giant lion head beside his feet. In addition to Roosevelt as Hunter, he also made two other Roosevelt portraits (Oklahoma City, OK, 1907) and (A. B. Davis Middle School, Mount Vernon, New York, 1923). Vincenzo Miserendino working on one of his many Teddy Roosevelt portraits in his studio on the Bowery Other prominent sculptures of Theodore Roosevelt are located in the Roosevelt Garden Apartments located at the Grand Concourse between 171st and 172nd Streets in Manhattan, in Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, New York and a Manhattan elementary school. A sculpture of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was done in 1934, along with a sculpture of Franklin Roosevelt's mother Sara Delano Roosevelt. Both sculptures are now in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, New York. Miserendino did several statues of Christopher Columbus, one of which is an 8 1/2' bronze statue of Christopher Columbus mounted on a 10 1/2' foot marble pedestal in City Park, Reading, Pennsylvania. It was commissioned by the United Italian Societies of Reading and Berks County for the 500th anniversary of the Columbus voyage to the new world, and unveiled and dedicated on October 12, 1925. The statue was rededicated in 1992. Another statue of Columbus is on the lawn of the Connecticut State Capitol. In 1930, he sculpted a public monument of Thomas Mott Osborne, a prison reform leader, from bronze and granite for the department of parks and recreation in Auburn, NY. Bust of Adolph Ochs in Lobby of the New York Times Adolph Ochs, the founder of the modern The New York Times, commissioned a bust of himself from Miserendino, which was completed in bronze and marble in 1933 in Long Island City, NY, and today is placed in the lobby of the modern New York Times Building on 40th Street and 8th Avenue in New York. The other bust of Ochs bust in bronze and wood and is in Oglethorpe, GA. The Columbus statue in Hartford, Connecticut, near Bushnell Park was removed in June 2020 Other works include a busts of Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Enrico Caruso, Thomas Paine, and former Secretary of the Treasury (under Theodore Roosevelt) Leslie M. Shaw, Emerson, Daniel Frohman, Willy Pogany, J. L. Holftrup, Edward F. Albee, and Betalo Rubino among numerous others. Miseredino was also able to sell watercolors, paintings and murals, such as \\"The Spring Dance\\" to the Palais Royal on Broadway, an early motion picture house in New York City, for their lobby, as chronicled on April 17, 1917 in American Art News. Miserendino's last and largest statue of Theodore Roosevelt, which was eight times life-size was commissioned in 1941, and scheduled to be placed in Boone, Iowa in 1943. However, at the time of casting, it had its 4,000 pounds of bronze appropriated for the World War II war effort. Miserendino commented at the time that Theodore Roosevelt himself would have approved of that decision to put the service of the country first. The monument was finally cast in 1946 (after Miserendino's death) by the Roman Bronze Corporation of Corona, N.Y. It arrived in Boone in November 1946 and put into place on January 6, 1948. The statue depicts Roosevelt rising out of a mountainous landscape with his hand outstretched as if addressing a crowd. Ten bas reliefs of Roosevelt's outdoor accomplishments are depicted below his figure. Prominent shows Miserendino showed his work several times at the New York Academy of Design and the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. In the 1920s, Miserendino had a show at the Tiffany Studios of watercolors and sculptures, which had been organized by Louis C. Tiffany. Personal life Miserendino was married to Julia Beninati from 1904 until 1943 (his death). He had six children, Joseph, Vivian, Eleanor, Isabel, Cecelia & Theodore (named after Roosevelt). He spent the majority of his married life in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, and commuted to his studio on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Miserendino was well enough known in his own day to be mentioned in the book Peregrina: Love and Death in Mexico by Alma M. Reed. Miserendino himself published a book, \\"Art in Its Making and the Law of Success\\" in 1923. He died of a heart attack in 1943 and is buried in the Saint Raymond's Cemetery.

BESTOR ‚Äì Belgian Science and Technology Online Resources - Notitie over Ren√© Tavernier, reference on January 31, 2017. Biography Ren√© Tavernier was born on 26 August 1914 in Nevele, the son of a veterinary surgeon. After attending the Sint-Lievenscollege in Ghent, he completed courses in geology and mineralogy at the State University of Ghent. His academic career started in 1937 with his appointment as an assistant in the Laboratory of Geology at the State University of Ghent. After his PhD, he became a substitute teacher for the Physical Geography course. In 1943 he became a foreman and one year later professor at the Laboratory of Physical Geography, where he was appointed professor ordinarius in 1948. In the beginning of his career his teaching was limited to Physical Geography, but was expanded to Geology in 1952. From 1955 onwards he was charged with the teaching of purely geological subjects. Geukens, Fernand, \\"In Memoriam Ren√© Tavernier\\", In: Jaarboek 1993‚Äì1996, Brussel: KVAB, p. 99-100. From 1943 until 1950 he was responsible for the supply of drinking water for the allied troops and of cooling water for the heavy anti-aircraft defence at the Belgian Geological Service. On 8 October 1955, Tavernier became a corresponding member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts. He became an active member on 20 September 1958 and administrator in 1967. \\"Tavernier Ren√©\\", in: De Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgi√´ voor wetenschappen en kunsten en haar leden, Brussel, Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgi√´ voor wetenschappen en kunsten, 2010, p. 251-252 Aside from that, he was a member of the Royal Academy for Overseas Sciences and of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS). He was president of the IUSS from 1950 to 1954 and in 1986 he was made an honorary member.\\"IUSS Honorary members\\", in: IUSS Bulletin, 115 (2009), p. 46 Tavernier was one of the founders of the Belgian Society for Soil Science and served as Secretary-General from 1950 until 1958. He was also a member of the Royal Dutch Geographical Society, the American Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry and corresponding member of the Acad√©mie d'Agriculture de France. Moreover, he received the honorary title of Commander in the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.  Work  In 1935 Ren√© Tavernier received the Mac Leod Prize, named after Julius Mac Leod, professor at the State University of Ghent,Prijs Mac Leod, Julius Mac Leod (1857-1919). for his licentiate thesis. His doctoral research was awarded the Baron van Ertborn Prize in 1948.Prijs Baron van Ertborn, Baron Octave van Ertborn (1839-1909) (BESTOR), (ODIS).) Both papers were studies on Neogene sediments in Belgium. The Neogene sands were studied according to the level of heavy minerals they contained. In this way, Ren√© Tavernier was able to distinguish between the marine and continental sands of Low Belgium and to determine the region of provenance of these sands. His geological interest was related to the sedimentology of the Cenozoic formations of the North Sea Basin, the Quaternary in Belgium, the fossil periglacial structures, the evolution of the basin of the Scheldt during the Quaternary and of the coastal plain during the Holocene, the fluctuation of the sea level, etc. Under the impetus of Professor Victor Van Straelen the Comit√© voor de Opname van de Bodem- en Vegetatiekaart van Belgi√´ (Committee for the Recording of the Soil and Vegetation Map of Belgium) was founded in 1946. The project, which started in 1947, was funded by the Instituut tot Aanmoediging van het Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek in Nijverheid en Landbouw (IWONL) (Institute for the Promotion of Scientific Research into Industry and Agriculture).Instituut tot Aanmoediging van het Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek in Nijverheid en Landbouw (IWONL). In order to realize the soil map, three different centers collaborated in the recording of data: Leuven, Gembloux and Ghent. Being the person responsible for the center in Ghent, Ren√© Tavernier saw the need for coordination from the start. He aspired to build one national center. From 1950 onwards, Ren√© Tavernier was the director of the Center of Soil Cartography ‚Äì Centrum voor Bodemkartering (C.V.B.) with the main task of recording the soil maps, creating a national legend, and coordinating the activities at national level.Van Ranst, E. & Sys, C., Eenduidige legende voor de digitale bodemkaart van Vlaanderen (schaal 1:20 000), reference on August 2, 2014. This work was awarded the decennial prize for Geological Sciences in 1968. The C.V.B. remained active until its dissolution in 1976.Groessens, Eric en Groessens-Van Dyck, Marie-Claire, \\"De Aardwetenschappen\\" in: Robert Halleux et al.

Ren√© Tavernier took part in the organization of the 4th Congress of the International Soil Science Society in Amsterdam in 1950, where he was elected President of ISSS. Following the 5th ISSS congress, which took place in 1954 in L√©opoldville (Kinshasa), he worked on a classification system for tropical soils, in collaboration with the National Institute of Agricultural Studies in the Belgian Congo (INEAC-NILCO). From 1951 Ren√© Tavernier also worked with the USDA Soil Conservation Service in the preparation of a soil taxonomy, especially with its Director of Soil Survey Investigations, Guy D. Smith.Properties, Classification and Management of Oxisoils, Guy D. Smith Memorial Slide Collections, reference on January 31, 2017. Between 1952 and 1958 he was a member of the Geological Council and was charged with the preparation of the stratigraphic scale of the Quaternary. In 1957, Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt and Ren√© Tavernier gave the Holocene epoch the name of Flandrien, based on the transgression sediments in Flanders. The term Flandrien is now completely obsolete, even as a synonym. Stratigrafie , reference on August 2, 2014. In 1958, Ren√© Tavernier was a member of the executive committee of the National Institute of Agricultural Studies in the Belgian Congo (INEAC-NILCO). In 1960 he founded the International Soil Science Center at the State University of Ghent. This center, aiming to serve the third world, started in 1963 with postgraduate courses. He managed to show the importance of geological knowledge in major agricultural development projects. Within the European Community he was asked in 1980 to create a soil map at a scale of 1:1,000,000. This work was completed in 1985.

It is the second in the series to be told from dual perspectives. Plot The novel starts with Sydney Sage in re-education, still in her dark cell, called reflection time by the Alchemists. She is still resisting their mind games, holding onto Adrian's love for her, until they start talking about letting her see her family if she admits she has been corrupted, making her think that if she's out of reflection, she might be able to see Adrian in a dream. Meanwhile, Adrian is still searching for her in his dreams, but sporadically, and is losing heart because he never connects, so he turns to drinking again. Jill tells his mother where he is. Since she's out of prison, she comes and takes him to the Moroi Court, where he meets Nina Sinclair again. He takes her under his wing, oblivious to the fact that she's in love with him. While at Court, Adrian discovers that his parents don't love each other, and that his mother is staying with his father for the money and status, which disgusts him. Back in the secret Alchemist facility, Sydney tells the Alchemists that she is ready to 'purge the darkness' so she can get out of the dark cell, and then she is taken to re-education, where she meets other Alchemists who have all been there for varying amounts of time. They are all told about her relationship with a Moroi, and as a result, nobody speaks to her. They even go so far as to move as far away from her as possible. She thinks that she will be able to have a normal sleep, meaning that Adrian will be able to reach her, but when she wakes up in the morning, she realises that the Alchemists are still drugging them somehow. She quickly makes a friend who has been there over a year, and he provides her with snippets of information, while being careful not to get noticed. Adrian is taking Nina to various parties at Court, and after a visit to Sonya, in which he demands that Nina get compensation for her time and help with the research for the Spirit vaccine, Nina kisses him in his room. He pushes her away, but then she talks about how no one understands each other like they do because they are both Spirit users. He responds to her kiss, but then he thinks of Sydney and rejects Nina, trying to let her down gently. He then decides to go back to Palm Springs. Sydney makes the mistake of defending the Moroi and speaking out in her first class, and so is then subjected to \\"purging,\\" which means that she is given a drug that makes her nauseous but unable to vomit. Once under the drug's influence, she is shown images of happy Moroi. This \\"treatment\\" is designed to invoke the reaction and feeling of disgust and sickness when she sees Moroi. She realises that this needs repeat sessions to work. Adrian finally realises he hasn't been trying Sydney when she would be asleep as he's been on a vampire schedule. He begins trying at night. Sydney succeeds at cutting off the flow of anti-Spirit gas to her room, thanks to some help from her roommate. After a few days, she finally gets a Spirit dream with Adrian. The Alchemists' techniques clearly aren't working, because all she wants to do is kiss him! She gets woken up too soon, but they have dreams on following nights. Sydney decides to start exploring at night, using magic, and information from her friends, to check out the facility and see if she can find an escape route. After seeing an apology to her sister from Keith, Sydney realises that she is being held at the same facility he was, which gives her 'rescuers' a lead. Sydney gets hold of some salt and manages to magically charm it, trying to recreate her \\"Alchemist- proof\\" ink from the previous book, to give to one of the other young Alchemists before he gets re-inked. It works, so then other inmates want her to do the same for them. Adrian talks to Marcus and Eddie and the rest of the Palm Springs gang, and they try to figure out where Sydney is so they can break her out. Adrian and Marcus talk to Carley and Keith, and realise that the facility is closer than anyone knew. Adrian grows increasingly worried when he loses the dream connection with Sydney again and assumes she has been caught, which turns out to be true. The Alchemists have figured out she was using magic, and trapped her in a torture chamber. Adrian and the Dhampirs storm the facility and manage to get most of the inmates out, but realise Sydney is missing. So, Eddie and Adrian go to find her, and they get her and the only other occupant of the torture cells out as well. She happens to be Duncan's friend (a friend of Sydney on the re-education center )- Chantal who was missing for a year. They run, and Sydney and Adrian are meant to meet Marcus, but she wants to go off on their own as she says that if Sydney is with the other people , the alchemists might catch the others easily. They are found by the Alchemists again and again. Adrian has an idea of how Sydney would be granted aid from the Moroi Queen: by becoming his wife. They plan to have a Las Vegas wedding, but Adrian wants Sydney to have the best wedding she would want, with whatever dress, shoes, and accessories she wants, so he finds a venue that looks like one of her favourite places. To pay for all of it, he sells his Aunt Tatiana's cuff links, and makes the jewels into the wedding bands. They then have to escape the Alchemists again. Jill has arranged a helicopter ride from a small Moroi school as their escape, but Sydney has to get past the Alchemists that were torturing her in the facility, and she uses magic to threaten them with fire. She hates hurting them, but there is nothing she wouldn't do for Adrian. They make it to Court, and everybody is shocked that Adrian married a human, but Lissa allows Sydney to stay and the Alchemists - including Sydney's father, sister, and Ian (who has a crush on her) - are removed from the premises. The book ends with the discovery that Jill is missing. Characters * Sydney Sage - Narrator of the series. Alchemist and also a Witch.

She was estimated to be between 18 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible Hispanic ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and brown eyes. She also had a unique scar on the back of her left hand, which was shaped like the letter T. She also had an inch-long scar on the back of her left thigh. She was wearing a white gold, 14-karat engagement ring with a small diamond. She was clothed in a pinkish-orange suit with a faux black fur coat and calf-high suede boots. The only items the Jane Doe carried were a house key and padlock key. The padlock key was attached to a broken chain. Investigation No missing persons have been found who match the victim's description. Investigators have the girl's DNA and fingerprints. A forensic facial reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to assist with identification. =Arrest of Gary Stamp= Police received a confession from a Texas man who claimed he had assisted with dumping the victim's body.

It was first proved by Hassler Whitney in 1957, and is an important tool in the field of approximation theory for obtaining upper estimates on the errors of best approximation. Statement of the theorem Denote the value of the best uniform approximation of a function f\\\\in C([a,b]) by algebraic polynomials P_n of degree \\\\leq n by : E_n(f)_{[a,b]} := \\\\inf_{P_n}{\\\\ f-P_n \\\\_{C([a,b])}} The moduli of smoothness of order k of a function f\\\\in C([a,b]) are defined as: : \\\\omega_k(t):=\\\\omega_k(t;f;[a,b]) :=\\\\sup_{h\\\\in [0,t]} \\\\\\\\Delta_h^k(f;\\\\cdot)\\\\_{C([a,b-kh])} \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } \\\\quad t\\\\in [0,(b-a)/k], : \\\\omega_k(t):=\\\\omega_k((b-a)/k)\\\\quad \\\\text{ for} \\\\quad t>(b-a)/k , where \\\\Delta_h^k is the finite difference of order k. Theorem: [Whitney, 1957] If f\\\\in C([a,b]), then : E_{k-1}(f)_{[a,b]}\\\\leq W_k \\\\omega_k\\\\left(\\\\frac{b-a}{k};f;[a,b]\\\\right) where W_k is a constant depending only on k. The Whitney constant W(k) is the smallest value of W_k for which the above inequality holds. The theorem is particularly useful when applied on intervals of small length, leading to good estimates on the error of spline approximation. Proof The original proof given by Whitney follows an analytic argument which utilizes the properties of moduli of smoothness. However, it can also be proved in a much shorter way using Peetre's K-functionals. Let: : x_0:=a, \\\\quad h:=\\\\frac{b-a}{k}, \\\\quad x_j:=x+0+jh, \\\\quad F(x) = \\\\int_a^x f(u) \\\\, du, : G(x):=F(x)-L(x;F;x_0,\\\\ldots,x_k), \\\\quad g(x):=G'(x), : \\\\omega_k(t):=\\\\omega_k(t;f;[a,b])\\\\equiv \\\\omega_k(t;g;[a,b]) where L(x;F;x_0,\\\\ldots,x_k) is the Lagrange polynomial for F at the nodes \\\\\\\\{x_0,\\\\ldots,x_k\\\\\\\\}. Now fix some x\\\\in [a,b] and choose \\\\delta for which (x+k\\\\delta)\\\\in [a,b]. Then: : \\\\int_0^1 \\\\Delta_{t\\\\delta}^k (g;x) \\\\, dt =(-1)^kg(x)+\\\\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{k-j} \\\\binom{k}{j} \\\\int_0^1 g(x+jt\\\\delta) \\\\, dt : =(-1)^kg(x)+\\\\sum_{j=1}^k{(-1)^{k-j} \\\\binom{k}{j} \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\delta}(G(x+j\\\\delta)-G(x))}, Therefore: : g(x) \\\\leq \\\\int_0^1 \\\\Delta_{t\\\\delta}^k(g;x) \\\\, dt + \\\\frac{2}{\\\\delta}\\\\G\\\\_{C([a,b])} \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\binom{k}{j}\\\\frac{1}{j} \\\\leq \\\\omega_k(\\\\delta)+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}2^{k+1}\\\\G\\\\_{C([a,b])} And since we have \\\\G\\\\_{C([a,b])}\\\\leq h\\\\omega_k(h), (a property of moduli of smoothness) : E_{k-1}(f)_{[a,b]}\\\\leq \\\\g\\\\_{C([a,b])} \\\\leq \\\\omega_k(\\\\delta) +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta} h 2^{k+1}\\\\omega_k(h). Since \\\\delta can always be chosen in such a way that h\\\\geq \\\\delta \\\\geq h/2, this completes the proof. Whitney constants and Sendov's conjecture It is important to have sharp estimates of the Whitney constants. It is easily shown that W(1)=1/2, and it was first proved by Burkill (1952) that W(2)\\\\leq 1, who conjectured that W(k)\\\\leq 1 for all k. Whitney was also able to prove that : W(2)=\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\quad \\\\frac{8}{15}\\\\leq W(3) \\\\leq 0.7 \\\\quad W(4)\\\\leq 3.3 \\\\quad W(5)\\\\leq 10.4 and : W(k)\\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\quad k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} In 1964, Brudnyi was able to obtain the estimate W(k)=O(k^{2k}), and in 1982, Sendov proved that W(k)\\\\leq (k+1)k^k. Then, in 1985, Ivanov and Takev proved that W(k)=O(k\\\\ln k), and Binev proved that W(k)=O(k). Sendov conjectured that W(k)\\\\leq 1 for all k, and in 1985 was able to prove that the Whitney constants are bounded above by an absolute constant, that is, W(k)\\\\leq 6 for all k. Kryakin, Gilewicz, and Shevchuk (2002) were able to show that W(k)\\\\leq 2 for k \\\\leq 82000, and that W(k)\\\\leq 2+\\\\frac{1}{e^2} for all k.

Early life Bholekar was born in Bollakpalli. He obtained his diploma in drawing and painting from the Sir J.J. School of Art, Mumbai, completed Diploma in Painting in 1961 and since then continued painting, winning several awards, participating several state and national exhibitions, and organising art activities. He was also a graduate from Osmania University. He participated in several group and one-man shows in Portugal, Italy, Macedonia, Poland, Germany, New Delhi, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bangalore Chennai, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Amritsar, Raipur, Baroda and took part in Art Conference National Academy of Fine Arts, International Arts Conference Lalit Kala Academy 3rd Triennale, New Delhi World Telugu Conference and Artiste Conference A.P. State Lalit Kala Academy Hyderabad. Bholekar came from a small village called Bollakpalli, on the banks of river Manjeera which is 5 kilometers away from Banswada in the Kamareddy district of Telangana State in India. He belonged to the Patlolla family where he was also known as Patlolla Srihari. He got his name Bholekar when it was recorded by Marathi-based institutions where he initially studied. This is due to the practice of the people of Maharashtra of adding the '-Kar' suffix to one's village/community and keeping it as a surname. As he was born and brought up in Telangana in India he set his paintings of rural life in a modern style by powerful imageries with an unusual and unique background setup. Most of his subjects portray not only the life of Telangana and its culture, customs, traditions, difficulties, plights, misfortunes and predicaments but also abstracts and international level art-works. The Art of Bholekar brings the significant emotional, cultural and cognitive evaluations of nature of life.' Bholekar died on August 23, 2018. Career and style He worked as the Chief Artist at Indian Air Force at Begumpet and in 1996 he was honoured with Commendation by A.O.C ‚Äì in ‚Äì C.H.Q.T.C Indian Air Force, Bholekar attributed his free-spirited nature to the village life he grew up in. ‚ÄúTill 10 years I enjoyed the village life. Art has not developed because of it but its influence is still there. The energy, the process and boldness in my works comes from village atmosphere. I had come through so many situations in early life; not hardships, but I enjoyed my life as a child. My parents did not allow me to go and play in the jungle‚Äù. A specialist in mural paintings, Bholekar has the distinction of holding the first contemporary one- man show in Salar Jung Museum in 1963. ‚ÄúI was just 21 and had exhibited my works,‚Äù . The exhibits made the art lovers sit up and take notice of the young artist. ‚ÄúThe modern paintings were bold and not decorative. The theme was my village and my imagination of the village,‚Äù His works travelled far and wide and made a name for him in the international arena. He also worked as a chief artist in Begumpet airport and worked vigorously in the world of art for 18 years before walking away from it. ‚ÄúI stopped everything and wanted to be a simple man without any artistic attachments,‚Äù he said, \\"Was it easy to stay away from art? ‚ÄúI have a strong will power. I stopped drinking and smoking at the age of 35 because of willpower. I am born with art instinct and returned to printmaking‚Äù. Bholekar's art encompasses many different media. After making a mark in print media, he gravitated to ink drawings. ‚ÄúHere artists do not interact much with artists of other countries. Their works are simple as they do not experiment. Their subject is same and as a result, they get stagnated. I don‚Äôt want to be like that‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy drawings will continue for some time and then I will shift to another media.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne can enjoy the design sense and interpret the work in one‚Äôs own way. My abstract drawing is like music. One need not know the intricacies of laya and raga but its rhythm is appreciated. Likewise, art lovers can enjoy the rhythmic lines and its composition and it is aesthetic too‚Äù.

It is a part of the integrated rescue system in the Czech Republic.  History  On 24 March 1913 two skiers died in Krkono≈°e. Hanƒç and Vrbata participated on a 50 km long ski race. During the race Hanƒç became exhausted and so Vrbata gave him his jacket to keep him warm. Both of these men died on hypothermia and this day is known as the Day of the Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic. In virtue of this incident was the Mountain Rescue Service in Krkono≈°e founded. It happened on 12 May 1935. Later on, in 1948 was Mountain Rescue Service founded in Jesen√≠ky, the same year also in ≈†umava, 1949 in Orlick√© hory, 1951 in Beskydy, 1954 in Jizersk√© hory and finally 1955 in Kru≈°n√© hory. On 1 December 1954 Mountain Rescue Service became one united organisation. All volunteer teams were transferred into this organisation. Regional committees were established to control over its members. On 21 June 1968 Mountain Rescue Service joined IKAR (International Mountain Rescue Services Federation) and UIAA (Union Internationale des Associations d¬¥Alpinisme). Since 2004 Mountain Rescue Service is under Ministry of Regional Development.  Structure  As stated before, Mountain Rescue Service operates in 7 districts. These districts are: * Krkono≈°e * Jesen√≠ky * ≈†umava * Orlick√© hory * Beskydy * Jizersk√© hory * Kru≈°n√© hory Organisation's headquarters is located in ≈†pindler≈Øv Ml√Ωn.

(full-time employees) with its chief Ji≈ô√≠ Bro≈æek and volunteer organisation Horsk√° slu≈æba ƒåR, o. s. with its chief Adolf Klep≈°. These organisations operate as single organisation and people won't see any difference. Full-time employees get usual salary and equipment. Volunteer members work for free and are eligible to get all the clothing and equipment. Physical exams and knowledge are the same for both of organisations. Full-time employees sometimes help in other areas; volunteers are stationed in one area only.  Tasks and Legal Status  Mountain Rescue Service's main tasks include: * to organise and carry out rescue and search actions in mountain terrain * to provide first aid and secure transport of injured people * to create conditions for safety of visitors of the mountains * to secure the operation of rescue and reporting stations of the Mountain Rescue Service * to install and maintain warning and information devices * to cooperate with the publishing and distribution of preventive-security materials * to inform the public about weather and snow conditions in the mountains and about the Mountain Rescue Service's measures taken to secure safety in the mountains * to cooperate with the public administration, nature and environment protection agencies and other authorities and organisations * to monitor the injury rate, investigate the causes of injuries in the mountains and propose and recommend measures for its reduction * to carry out patrol service on mountain ridges and ski slopes and emergency services at Mountain Rescue Service stations and houses * to carry out avalanche observations * to prepare and train its members and candidates * to cooperate with other rescue organisations both in the Czech Republic and abroad ‚Äì TOPR, Slovakian Mountain Rescue Service and German Mountain Rescue Service organisations. Mountain Rescue Service's tasks are stated in the Tourism Act. Members of the Mountain Rescue Service does not have any law enforcement powers. Mountain Rescue Service Act is being worked on. Mountain Rescue Service operates with a high-quality equipment. ATVs, snowmobiles and jeeps are used for daily duties. Also Mountain Rescue Service has snowcats for difficult rescue operations. Air rescues are conducted with Air Rescue Service or State Police cooperation. Because the organisation is a member of integrated rescue system, they are used during the floods and other incidents. Also the organisation is authorised to use emergency vehicle lighting and sirens. This possibility is used during the emergency responses, search and rescue operations or trainings. Every member and candidate has to be trained to use the emergency lighting and sirens.

Bag 9055 Gweru, Zimbabwe * There is another extension of the scheme at a different location altogether called 'Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme Extension'. * 'Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme Extension' is 2 km upstream just a kilometre shot of the Kadoma-Gokwe Road. The hectarage is about 6.8ha fully utilised. The extension is known as Mushonga irrigation though not its official name. Mushonga irrigation is supplied by the same literal canal that supplies the main irrigation scheme. It has no night storage. Water Source Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme draws water from Ngondoma Dam, which has an estimated capacity of 7.5 million cubic metres. It is the 40th of the 41 recorded by FAO as Major Dams in Zimbabwe.Ngondoma Dam FAO Table 2.3 Major Dams in Zimbabwe Retrieved 03 December 2015 Ngongoma Irrigation Scheme has a gravity fed surface irrigation system. A canal conveys water from the dam into a reservoir which is situated just at the edge of the irrigation scheme. From the reservoir another canal conveys water to various portions of the irrigation and from a lateral to fields farmers fetch water using siphons. Another night storage has been built about 1500m to the northend of the scheme to service plots further afield. Ngondoma Irrigation Main Leteral Canal Feb 1, 2016 Ngondoma Dam was constructed in 1967 mainly to supply Empress Nickel Mine which also was established in 1968 the year Ngondoma Irrigation was established. Empress Mine closed down in 1985. The dam provides drinking water for both livestock and human beings. Today the dam supports, apart from the irrigation scheme, Empress Mine Growth Point, Columbina Rural Service Center, Villages this Zhombe side of the dam and the Gokwe side of it. Villagers use the dam water for watering their gardens, livestock watering, brick moulding and other domestic purposes. Ngondoma Dam Latitude: S 18¬∞ 27' 26\\" Longitude: E 29¬∞ 24' 50\\" Ngondoma Dam is surrounded by a rich flora as on record of the Flora of Zimbabwe. Empress Mine Township which starts immediately to the east of the dam has inviting beauty in flora such as the Acacia amythethophylla, Colophospermum mopane, Euphorbia hirta, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Albizia harveyi, Lantana camara, Senna singueana, Typha capensis and Bauhinia macrantha just to name a few from the 112 records list compiled by Tessa Ball on November 9, 1996. External Beneficiaries About 80% of the water released from the dam reaches the irrigation's night storage. The other 20% is shared among animals and people upstream. People at Columbina Rural Service Center also fetch water for building, washing and other uses from the canal that transports water to Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme. Soil Texture Soils are predominantly reddish-brown and rough pH ranges of 6.0-6.8 throughout the whole scheme.  Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development  Ngondoma was one of the eight irrigation schemes that benefitted from the farm equipment sourced by the government from Brazil. It received Tractors, ploughs, rome discs, fertiliser spreaders and planters.Lincoln Towindo  23 August 2015 Zim poised for agricultural major take-off __ Installation of irrigation equipment sourced under Brazil‚Äôs More Food for Africa Programme has begun in various parts of Zimbabwe and will be complete before summer cropping. Around 80 irrigation schemes ‚Äì eight per province ‚Äì have already received centre pivots, hose reels, irrigators and pumps plus other related equipment under the programme‚Äôs first phase. Tractors, ploughs, rome discs, fertiliser spreaders and planters complete the consignments distributed to farmers since July 29, 2015. Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe  Agriculture Retrieved 2 February 2016 Most farmers no longer use animal drawn ploughs on their plots because tractors are efficient, fast and cheaper. Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme Workshop Management Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme is one of the successful farmer managed schemes in Zimbabwe. The scheme is fully farmer managed, through the democratically elected Irrigation Scheme Management Committee which has to be in office for two years before yet another election. The committee is supported by AGRITEX workers. An Extension Worker who is a government employed graduate in Agricultural Science and Practice provides technical advice to both the Irrigation Scheme Management Committee and the farmers. Usual Crops Main crops are vegetables, okra, beans and maize. Tomatoes are not grown by many farmers unless they are contracted by a reliable company.Tomatoes are usually grown in bulk if and when contracted by factories. __ http://library.fes.de/fulltext/bueros/simbabwe/01175006.htm =Marketing= Green maize buyers come from places such as Columbina Rural Service Center, Empress Mine Township and even as far as Kadoma, Kwekwe, Gweru and Harare. Buyers provide their own transport. Okra buyers are usually from among the farmers themselves. The buy from other farmers at producer price and ferry tonnes of okra to Bulawayo where they wholesale it to market stall holders at Rankini. Beans, butternuts, cucumbers, green paper, vegetables and other crops have cash markets from the local community and the surrounding towns. Sometimes farmers are contracted to produce tomatoes in bulk. Comments Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme is highly productive and profitable because of good soils, adequate water supply throughout the year, and good management. It is also one of the cheapest run irrigation schemes for the government because water supply is almost free throughout the year because the canal uses no electricity or fuel, unlike its sister scheme Senkwasi Irrigation Scheme 17 km South, whose services are regularly interrupted by ZESA electric power load shedding.

Only one was completed, though it was much modified. Design and development Like his earlier two, aircraft Gilbert Landray's GL.03 Pouss Pou () was a tandem wing aircraft in the two axis control Mignet Pou-du-Ciel style. It differed chiefly from the GL.01 and GL.02 in its twin fin, pusher configuration. It also had a tricycle undercarriage. It was an entirely wood framed aircraft with fabric covering. The original, 1980, GL.03 had much in common with the GL.02. It shared the same wings, where the rear span was less than that of the forward one, as well as using the same modified modified Citroen Ami 8 motorcar air-cooled flat- twin engine. Tests led to modifications of the wings so they had almost equal span and to the installation of a new engine. The revised GL.03 is described below. Mignet designs are controlled in pitch by changing the incidence of the forward wing. To do this the forward, upper wing of the GL.03 was mounted on four co-linear pivot points. The inner pair of these were at the top of two almost vertical faired struts from the upper fuselage longerons and the outer pair on inverted, outward leaning V-struts from the same fuselage members. Vertical links from the rear of the wing ran externally to the lower fuselage, where they were connected to the control column. There were no ailerons. Both forward and rear wings were essentially rectangular, apart from slightly tapered and turned-up tips. The rear wing was mounted on top of the upper longerons. The fuselage of the GL.03 was flat sided, with rounded upper decking. The single seat cockpit was close to the nose, ahead of the forward wing's leading edge and enclosed under a side hinged, one piece canopy which merged into the rear decking at the wing struts without change of height. There was provision for a second, tandem cockpit but the GL.03's Citro√´n GS612 four cylinder engine was not powerful enough to lift two adults. This engine was positioned at the centre of the rear wing, it and the fuselage extending just far enough behind the trailing edge to allow clearance for the two blade propeller. There were small cooling air entry ducts on the cowling sides above the wing. In place of the conventional tails of the GL.01 and GL.02 tractor designs, the pusher GL.03 had twin straight edged, strongly tapered fins on the rear wing. They extended below the wing and their trailing edges coincided with its. Each fin carried a balanced rudder. There was a simple, fixed tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels on narrow, almost horizontal cantilever legs which reached out from the lower fuselage, producing a track. The Pouss Pou first flew in August 1980 and obtained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 21 July 1981. It took part in the 1981 RSA rally where it was awarded the SFACT Cup. After that success the GL.03 was modified into the GL.31 tandem seat version. This had a more powerful Citro√´n engine and a forward wing with a span increased to , centrally supported by tubular, inverted V pairs in place of the vertical, faired struts. The second seat was enclosed by a separately side hinged canopy which extended back to the leading edge of the rear wing. At about the same time the wheels were enclosed by spats. Some years later the Pouss Pou was successfully re-engined with a Rotax flat twin but was eventually damaged in a landing accident at Libourne. It remained on the French civil aircraft register in 2014.

It was preceded by the Red Friday massacre of 5,000 Jews in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto on 27‚Äì28 June 1941 by the Police Battalion 309, but surpassed only by the Police Battalion 45 massacre of 33,000 Jews at Babi Yar in Reichskommissariat Ukraine outside Kiev on 29‚Äì30 September 1941; and the final Aktion Erntefest massacre of more than 43,000 Jews at the Majdanek concentration camp and its subcamps on 3 November 1943 perpetrated by the Trawniki men from Ukraine along with the Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police from Hamburg. Jewish neighbourhood before World War II with store signs in Polish and the Reform Tempel Synagogue in the background =The Ghetto= On 20 December 1941 the Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Ghetto was set up officially, and closed from the outside. Walls were built (with three gates), and the windows facing out boarded up. Some 20,000 Jews were crammed there into a little space. Rationing was enforced, with insufficient food, and workshops set up to support the German war effort. Over the winter and until July 1942 most extrajudicial killings were carried out in Rudolf's Mill (Rudolfsm√ºhle). From August 1942 onward the courtyard of the SiPo headquarters was used for that. On 22 August 1942, the Nazis held the reprisal Aktion for the murder of a Ukrainian collaborator, which they blamed on a Jew. More than 1,000 Jews were rounded up and shot at the cemetery. The leader of the Jewish council, Mordechai Goldstein, was hanged in public, along with 20 members of the Jewish Ghetto Police. Before taking them to the SiPo headquarters, policemen raped Jewish girls and women. The Ghetto was reduced in size after the German and Ukrainian raid of 31 March 1942, and the burning of homes, in punishment for the council's noncompliance with the first deportation action. In April, September and November 1942 regular transports of Jews were sent in Holocaust trains to the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp north of the city. More Jews were brought in from smaller towns. About 11,000 Jewish captives subsisted in Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Ghetto when the next few Aktionen took place. On 24/25 January 1943 some 1,000 Jews without work permits were shot. Further 1,500‚Äì2,000 were deported to the Janowska concentration camp for extermination. On 22/23 February 1943, Brandt, who had succeeded Hans Kr√ºger as SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer, ordered the police forces to surround the ghetto in preparation for its final liquidation. The Aktion lasted for four days. Most victims were killed at the cemetery including the Jewish council. Soon later, the Germans put up announcements that Stanis≈Çaw√≥w was Judenfrei or free of Jews, nevertheless, the police continued searching the ghetto area for more victims until April. The last recorded Jews were murdered on 25 June 1943. Just before the liquidation of the Ghetto, a group of Jewish insurgents managed to escape. They formed a partisan unit called \\"Pantelaria\\" active on the outskirts of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w.

The group was attacked and destroyed by the Nazis in mid winter 1943‚Äì44. Anda and her new baby girl were killed. =Holocaust rescue= There were numerous rescue efforts during the ghetto liquidation. When the Jehovah's Witnesses learned that the Nazis planned to execute all Jews in the city, they organized an escape from the ghetto for a Jewish woman and her two daughters who later became Witnesses. They hid these Jewish women throughout the entire period of the war.2002 Yearbook of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. ‚Äî N.Y.: Watchtower, 2001; p. 143.

The Gawrych family hid five Jews until 8 March 1943, when they were raided by German policeman. Four Jews were shot and killed, and one (Szpinger) managed to escape. Jan Gawrych was arrested and subsequently was tortured and murdered. The Soviet army reached the city on 27 July 1944. Hidden by rescuers, there were about 100 Jewish Holocaust survivors liberated. In total about 1,500 Jews from Stanis≈Çaw√≥w survived the war elsewhere. =Aftermath= The commander of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w during the Bloody Sunday massacre SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Hans Kr√ºger (de, pl) embarked on a successful career in West Germany after the war ended. He was a chairman of the Association of Germans from Berlin and Brandenburg, and lobbied on behalf of the League of Eastern Expellees representing the interests of former Nazis among others. He ran his own firm. Due in part to his life in the public eye, he was questioned by the authorities. Six years later, in October 1965 a formal indictment against Kr√ºger was issued by the Dortmund State Prosecutor's Office. His trial lasted for two years. Kr√ºger sparked outrage for his anti- Semitic outbursts. On 6 May 1968, the M√ºnster State Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was released in 1986.

Meanwhile, in 1966 there were other trial proceedings held in Vienna and Salzburg against members of the Schupo and the Gestapo police serving in Stanis≈Çaw√≥w during the war. Following World War II, at the insistence of Joseph Stalin during Tehran Conference of 1943, Poland's borders were redrawn and Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (then again, Stanyslaviv) was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. Polish population was forcibly resettled back to new Poland before the end of 1946. The city was renamed after poet Ivan Franko in 1962 under Nikita Khrushchev. Since 1991, it is the capital of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast in sovereign Ukraine. Footnotes :a.

Disappearance  Emma Fillipoff was last seen in the immediate vicinity of the Empress Hotel in Victoria between 7:15 pm and 8:00 pm on November 28, 2012. She was observed being interviewed by Victoria police. Her red 1993 Mazda MPV was found in the Chateau Victoria parking lot with almost all her belongings in it, including her passport, library card, digital camera, clothes, a pillow, assorted ornaments, laptop, and recently borrowed library books. It is believed she used the van as storage. She spoke with Chateau Victoria staff at 7:00 am on the morning of her disappearance. In June 2018, a man reported that in the early morning following Fillipoff's disappearance, he had picked up a young woman in distress matching her description in nearby Esquimalt.  Timeline  =Pre-disappearance= Fillipoff arrived in Victoria in the fall of 2011 from Perth, Ontario. She had brief employment at the Red Fish Blue Fish seafood restaurant in Victoria's Inner Harbour. Since the work was seasonal, Fillipoff left the job on October 31, 2012. She assured co-workers she would be back in the spring. In what police believe was preparation to move back to Ontario, Fillipoff hired a tow-truck on November 21. She rented the truck in order to move her Mazda from Sooke to the Chateau Victoria parking garage. Unbeknownst to her family, Fillipoff had stayed at the Sandy Merriman House women's shelter on and off since February. On November 23, Fillipoff was captured on security footage at the Victoria YMCA, entering, then leaving, then entering multiple times as if possibly avoiding someone on the outside. In the days preceding her disappearance, Fillipoff had phoned her mother in Ontario, asking if she could come home. Each time her tone would quickly change and Emma would then ask her mother not to come. On the final call, her mother became aware that Emma had been staying at the Sandy Merriman House, and even though Emma had asked her not to come, she made plans to fly out immediately. Emma's last words to her mom were, \\"I don't know how I can face you.\\" Emma's mother arrived at Sandy Merriman House at about 11:00 pm on the 28th, three hours after Emma had been last seen by police at the Empress Hotel. Early on the day of November 28, Fillipoff had been captured on a 7-Eleven store video on Government Street purchasing a pre-paid cell phone. The video showed her hesitating in departing the store, seemingly checking the street outside. She returned to the 7-Eleven to buy a pre-paid credit card for $200. Reportedly, she left the Sandy Merriman House at about 6:00 p.m. that day. Soon after, she hailed a taxi and asked to be taken to the Victoria International Airport; however, she soon exited the taxi for lack of adequate fare, even though she had the $200 prepaid card. Minutes later, Fillipoff was seen walking barefoot in front of the Empress Hotel. An acquaintance of hers, Dennis Quay, called 9-1-1 to say a woman was in severe distress outside the hotel. Victoria police arrived, took Fillipoff's name, and spent 45 minutes speaking with her. Deciding that she was not a threat to herself or anyone else, they released her. Until a report surfaced in June 2018, no one reported seeing Emma since 8:00 pm that night. Later that evening, police met Fillipoff's mother at Sandy Merriman House; by midnight Emma was classified as a missing person. =Post- disappearance= Initially the police stated that Fillipoff had last been seen \\"with friends several blocks away on Burdett Avenue between Blanshard and Quadra streets.\\" Investigators explored more than 200 leads, turning up minimal information. Most evidence indicates she was planning to return home to Ottawa, but there was no proof that she ever left Victoria. The cell phone she bought had never been activated. Fillipoff's credit card was allegedly found on the side of the road near the Juan de Fuca Community Centre, north of where she disappeared. It was found by a stranger, whose use of the card to purchase cigarettes was tracked by police. =Emma Fillipoff's writings= Fillipoff wrote copious poems about her time in Victoria. None of it indicated that she was being stalked. Even though some of it indicated she was depressed, experts who appeared on The Fifth Estate said the writing did not have the hallmarks of suicidal ideation. According to Fillipoff's mother, however, the Sandy Merriman staff claimed that Emma \\"required both physical and medical intervention.\\" =Unrelated charges against mother and brother= In March 2016, Fillipoff's mother and brother were charged with money laundering, as well as drug and weapons offenses, after an OPP investigation. Shelley Fillipoff insisted the charges had nothing to do with the disappearance of Emma, saying \\"the one has nothing to do with the other.\\" In November 2016, all charges were dropped against Shelley Fillipoff, clearing her of any involvement.  November 29 sighting, other possible leads  In the summer of 2018, a witness named William came forward with new information about encountering a woman the morning after Fillipoff's disappearance. The woman matched her general description and demeanor. The report resulted in the organization of a search of the View Royal area of Victoria in December 2018. The search turned up no additional clues, but another search is planned for 2019. Victoria media drew information from Kimberly Bordage's podcast, The Search for Emma Fillipoff. Before this, the leads had been tenuous. The Campbell River Courier-Islander newspaper reported in May 2014 that Gastown, Vancouver, business owners Joel and Lori Sellen witnessed a man in their store throwing out a $25,000 missing persons reward poster for Fillipoff. The pair reported that the man said, \\"It's one of those missing persons posters, except she's not missing, she's my girlfriend and she ran away 'cause she hates her parents.\\" The owners immediately called the police. Although security video captured an image of the man, he has yet to be identified. Media coverage Emma's disappearance has received extensive print/web coverage both in Canada and abroad. In 2013, Fillipoff's disappearance was the subject of an episode of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television program, The Fifth Estate titled 'Finding Emma'. In 2017, her case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished. In 2020, Emma Fillipoff's disappearance was the subject of a long form series by the Canadian audio documentary series The Night Time Podcast titled 'Emma Fillipoff is Missing'.This series features interviews with Emma's mother Shelley, many of her closest friends, and the one time suspect Julien. This series was the featured podcast on Apple Podcasts for the week of January 12, 2020 and appeared in the top ten of Canada's podcast charts for several days.

Aquifer Susceptibility is the inherent ability of a formation to accept and transmit liquids (potentially including contaminants). Certain areas of the United States are becoming more reliant on groundwater to meet the needs of the population.  Causes  Everyday, roughly 2 millimeters of rainfall falls globally. About one fourth of that will make its way through the aquifers and become ground water. Shallow and permeable water tables tend to be more susceptible to contamination. In addition, the less rain an area receives the more concentrated the contamination will be. Evapotranspiration can also decrease the amount of water moving downward. Some aquifer susceptibility does happen naturally. Natural chemicals can seep through the aquifers from nearby soil and rocks. However, too much of this can be bad. One of the most common concerns is the amount of chloride and dissolved solids that are found in the water. Federal standards state the maximum for dissolved solids are 500 mg/L, and 250 mg/L for chloride. Dissolved solids and chloride are often found in coastal aquifers and in aquifers deeper than a few hundred feet. Iron and Magnesium can also affect the groundwater. It can also reduce the efficiency of well pumping. While there is not usually a huge amount of nitrogen in groundwater, human involvement can increase it. Federal standards state that the maximum level of nitrogen in groundwater is 10 mg/L. If humans do not interfere, levels generally stay around 0.2 mg/L. However, if levels exceed 3 mg/L, this could mean human involvement. Usually nitrogen is not harmful. But, it has been found to cause methemoglobenimia in infants. The susceptibility of the aquifer also depends on if the aquifer has large or small pores. A rock that has low conductivity level is known as an aquitard. This can constrict the amount of water that is available to use.  Effects on groundwater  Groundwater has become very important source of drinking water for over half of the United States. It is especially important in rural areas, where all of the drinking water comes from the ground. Here are some statistics on ground water dependability proved by the groundwater Project Education Policy: *22 percent of all freshwater withdrawals *53 percent of drinking water for the total population and 97 percent of drinking water for neutral population *40 percent of public water supply withdrawals *46 percent of domestic and commercial use *24 percent of industrial and mining use *34 percent of agricultural use (mostly for irrigation) Aquifers are also an important source for the groundwater that feeds into wells. The groundwater must go through these aquifers to get to the well. However, the well has an effect on the aquifers as well. Pumping through much water through these wells can cause a cone of depression around the well. The Virginia Department of Health and the U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a study to determine the susceptibility of aquifers in Virginia. The information is used to determine whether the groundwater is safe enough to drink. The study will take place over a period of four years. The researchers will use Carbon-14 to determine the age of the contamination.  Prevention  These aquifers need to be protected from contamination so they can provide clean water. Programs have been put in place to protect this valuable groundwater. These programs include Wellhead and Source Water Protection Program. Close attention also needs to be made in areas near agricultural and urban areas, as these are high risk areas for aquifer susceptibility.
