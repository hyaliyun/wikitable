It has a very simple ultrastructure, and a compact genome. As a common member of global oceanic picoplankton populations, this organism has a major role in the carbon cycle in many areas. Recently, O. tauri has been the subject of studies using comparative genomics and functional genomics, as it is of interest to researchers because of its compact genome and green lineage. History Ostreococcus tauri was discovered in 1994 in the Thau lagoon, France, in a year-long study of the picoplankton population of the lagoon using flow cytometry. O. tauri was found to be the main component of the picoplankton population in the lagoon, and images of cells produced by transmission electron microscopy revealed the smallest yet described free-living eukaryotic cells. O. tauri was immediately placed in the class Prasinophyceae based on the presence of characteristic chlorophyll pigments and Chlorophyceae-related carotenoids, and this classification was confirmed by further work. Anatomy Cells are roughly spherical (coccoid), averaging about 1 μm long by 0.7 μm wide. The cell's ultrastructure is very simple, lacking a cell wall and consisting of a nucleus, a single mitochondrion, a single chloroplast, and a single Golgi apparatus. Cells also lack flagella. Initially described as containing 14 chromosomes, it is now known that the nucleus contains 20 chromosomes, in all about 33 fg of DNA. Ecology Ostreococcus tauri is the dominant algal species, by cell abundance, in the Thau Lagoon in the south of France. The conditions that are thought to lead to this dominance are firstly that the Lagoon is used for intensive mollusc cultivation, and secondly that copper levels in the Lagoon are high. The first consideration selects for smaller cells (picoplankton); larger eukaryotic species of alga and many predators of smaller algae are preferentially consumed by the molluscs, which are filter feeders. The second consideration selects against cyanobacteria, as O. tauri is thought to cope better with \\"adverse conditions\\". The excess copper in the lagoon is thought to originate from agricultural chemicals used by surrounding vinyards. Use as a model organism As early as 1998, O. tauri was identified as \\"a good candidate for biological models such as cell division and/or genome sequencing studies\\". Genomics  In 2006, the O. tauri genome was sequenced by Derelle et al.. The 12.56 Mb genome organized in 20 chromosomes showed extreme gene density and few intron-containing genes. Two chromosomes with outlying characteristics (G+C content, intron structure) were identified, namely chromosome 2 and chromosome 19. Sequencing of other species of the Mamiellales order showed occurrence of similar outlying chromosomes in other species (O. lucimarinus, Micromonas pusilla & B. prasinos).

It was collected as well by Alston & Sandwith in southern Albania. Since that time the species had rarely been collected and was included in Flora Europaea (Webb & Chatter, 1964: 78) only as a note under P. arenarium subsp. Putchellum (Loisel.). After World War II, in 1954 it was collected by W. Ludwig in central Yugoslavia (BP. material, ex. Marburg), still on serpentine soil though outside Albania, whereas in August 1960, Polygonum albanicum was found on Vourinos mountain in northern Greece, where it had never been previously reported. Description Polygonum albanicum is an annual flowering herb that reaches 40–50 cm tall, with a wiry stem and stem branches that grow out from the base of the plant in an open form, or laying on ground soil. It has thin and slim pointed leaves, oblong, egg-shaped and without nervatures. Flowers occur alone or in couples, located on floppy cobs in a branched inflorescence.

It pursues technological, ecological, economic as well as design goals and seeks to achieve these primarily by making use of living materials, i.e. seeds, plants, part of plants and plant communities, and employing them in near–natural constructions while exploiting the manifold abilities inherent in plants. Soil bioengineering may sometimes be a substitute for classical engineering works; however, in most cases it is a meaningful and necessary method of complementing the latter. Its application suggests itself in all fields of soil and hydraulic engineering, especially for slope and embankment stabilization and erosion control.Schiechtl, H. M. (Trans. N.K. Horstmann, 1980). Bioengineering for Land Reclamation and Conservation. University of Alberta Press. Edmonton. Alberta. 404 pp. Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to provide some engineering function. Soil bioengineering is an effective tool for treatment of a variety of unstable and / or eroding sites. Soil bioengineering techniques have been used for many centuries. More recently Schiechtl (1980) has encouraged the use of soil bioengineering with a variety of European examples. Soil bioengineering is now widely practiced throughout the world for the treatment of erosion and unstable slopes.Gray, D.H. and A.T. Leiser. 1982. Biotechnical Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. Scarborough, Ontario, 271 pp. reprinted by Krieger Publishing Co. Malabar, Florida).Clark, J. and J. Hellin. 1996. Bio-engineering for Effective Road Maintenance in the Caribbean. Natural Resources Institute. The University of Greenwich. United Kingdom.  Fields of Application and Plants for Soil Bioengineering Control Works  Soil Bioengineering methods can be applied wherever the plants which are used as living building materials are able to grow well and develop. This is the case in tropical, subtropical and temperate zones whereas there are obvious limits in dry and cold regions, i.e. where arid, semi–arid and frost zones prevail. In exceptional cases, lack of water may be compensated for by watering or irrigation. In Europe, dry conditions limiting application exist in the Mediterranean as well as in some inner alpine and eastern European snowy regions. However, limits are most frequently imposed in alpine and arctic regions. These can usually be clearly noticed by the limited growth of woody plants (forest, tree and shrub lines) and the upper limits of closed turf cover. The more impoverished a region is in species, the less suited it is for the application of bioengineering methods.  Functions and Effects of Soil Bioengineering Structures  =Technical functions= *protection of soil surface from erosion by wind, precipitation, frost and flowing water *protection from rock fall *elimination or binding of destructive mechanical forces *reduction of flow velocity along banks *surface and/or deep soil cohesion and stabilization *drainage *protection from wind *aiding the deposition of snow, drift sand and sediments *increasing soil roughness and thus preventing avalanche release Apart from these, ecological functions are gaining in importance, particularly as these can be fulfilled to a very limited extent only by classical engineering constructions. =Ecological functions= *improvement of water regime by improved soil interception and storage capability as well as water *consumption by plants *soil drainage *protection from wind *protection from ambient air pollution *mechanical soil amelioration by the roots of plants *balancing of temperature conditions in near–ground layers of air and in the soil *shading *improvement of nutrient content in the soil and thus of soil fertility on previously raw soils *balancing of snow deposits *noise protection *yield increase on neighbouring cropland =Landscaping functions= *healing of wounds inflicted on the landscape by disasters and humans (exploitation of mineral resources, construction work, deposition of overburden, tunnel excavation material, industrial and domestic waste) *integration of structures into the landscape *concealment of offending structures *enrichment of the landscape by creating new features and structures, shapes and colours of vegetation =Economic effects= Bioengineering control works are not always necessarily cheaper in construction when compared to classical engineering structures. However, when taking into account their lifetime including their service and maintenance, they will normally turn out to be more economical. Their special advantages are: *lower construction costs compared to “hard” constructions *lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs *creation of useful green areas and woody plant populations on previously derelict land *Useful for income generation The result of soil bioengineering protection works are living systems which develop further and maintain their balance by natural succession (i.e. by dynamic self–control, without artificial input of energy). If the right living but also non–living building materials and the appropriate types of construction are chosen, exceptionally high sustainability requiring little maintenance effort can be achieved.

It passed directly over Broome, where there was much damage. Twenty six boats of the pearling fleet were sunk and 40 lives were lost.Bureau of Meteorology (1998). Tropical Cyclones (A Guide for Mariners in Northwest Australia), Pamphlet, Commonwealth of Australia =Cyclone 2= Track of Cyclone #2 A long-lived weak cyclone formed in the Gulf of Carpenteria on 3 January, and made landfall with a pressure of 996 hPa. =Cyclone 3= On 4 January 1911 a cyclone affected the Pilbara coast between Cossack and Onslow. The Glenbank was wrecked off Legendre Island with the loss of all but one of its crew. The cyclone crossed near Mardie Station where nearly every outbuilding was levelled to the ground and 6000-gallon tanks were blown away.BoM – Tropical Cyclones affecting Karratha/Dampier =Cyclone 4= This cyclone affected Queensland. =Cyclone 5= Cyclone 5 crossed the Cape York Peninsula. =Cyclone 6= This cyclone approached the Queensland coast near Townsville, Australia, but took a sharp turn away from the coast on 22 March. =Cyclone 7= The cyclone came ashore between Cape Upstart and Cape Bowling Green.

It is almost certainly Australia's worst weather-related maritime disaster since Federation with the loss of the coastal steamer Koombana. 1917-18 cyclone season =1918 Mackay cyclone= The 1918 Mackay cyclone struck the city of Mackay, Queensland, Australia on 2021 January 1918. It remains one of the most destructive cyclones to strike a populated centre in Australia. The eye of the storm passed to the north of the city just after sunrise on 21 January. During the height of the storm, barometric pressure was recorded at 932.6 hPa, one of the lowest recordings in Australia. However, the pressure was probably a lot lower, as the barometer would not go beyond 932.6 hPa, and the eye of the storm did not cross directly over Mackay where the measurement was taken. The meteorologist at the time stated that the barometer was at its maximum low reading for at least 30 minutes before the cyclone moved inland and away, allowing the pressure to finally rise. Few buildings in the centre of Mackay escaped without significant structural damage. The accompanying storm surge resulted in a sea- level-rise of 2.36 metres above the highest spring tide level, with one witness later recalling waves of 2–3 metres breaking in the main street. Communication links into Mackay were destroyed. The outside world did not learn of the Mackay cyclone until five days after impact, leading to some speculation the city had been completely destroyed. Record amounts of rainfall were recorded in Mackay, the totals to 9 a.m. are as follows: *22 Jan – 627mm *23 Jan – 438mm *24 Jan – 346mm * Total rainfall for January – 2161mm The rainfall resulted in the Pioneer River's highest flood level at the time, which took 2 weeks to subside. Damage wasn't limited to Mackay. In Rockhampton, over 350 km south of Mackay, houses lost their roofs and solid jacaranda trees were uprooted. Extensive structural damage was also reported in Yeppoon and Mount Morgan. Rainfall associated with the cyclonic system was responsible for the big Rockhampton Flood of 1918 in February. A total of thirty people perished in the disaster, including two in Rockhampton and another in Yeppoon. =1918 Innisfail cyclone= The 1918 Innisfail cyclone made landfall in the area around Innisfail, Queensland, Australia on 10 March 1918. It was more severe than the earlier Mackay storm. Only 12 houses survived being unroofed or totally destroyed. Damage was also sustained in Cairns, 100 km to the north, and inland to the Atherton Tableland. A 3.6m storm surge was experienced to the south at Mission Beach. 37 people were killed in Innisfail, and an estimated 40 to 60 more in outlying areas. The lowest pressure recorded was 926hPa, but again, damage to recording equipment meant that no accurate minimum for the storm's center survived. Estimates place the figure below 910hPa.Historical Impacts Along The East Coast Following this destruction, the area experienced a period of prosperity in the local agricultural industries. This led to the construction of many buildings in a grand art-deco style.

They caused a media sensation with their end of year project, Going Places, in which they claimed to have spent thousands of pounds of university union money on a holiday to Málaga. Origin The Leeds 13 started working together in the early spring of 1998. They were 3rd year Fine Art students at the University of Leeds. Their collaboration began when the entire year group – 13 artists with very different individual practices – decided to work together on a single artwork. Their ambition was to devise a critical art practice that tested the protocols of academia and was antithetical to the highly commercialised and predominantly object-based YBA phenomenon that had grown out of Goldsmiths College. Their resulting projects were conceived collectively through a series of group discussions. Projects =Going Places (1998)= Going Places (1998) is the first-and best known-work by The Leeds 13. The project involved a staged trip to Málaga, ostensibly paid for by a grant, that was presented as an end-of-year show. The work went on to generate significant media coverage of both the holiday story and the subsequent revelation that it was staged. The story of 'Going Places' was first published nationally in the Sunday Mirror, and on the following Wednesday the Leeds 13 were invited onto Radio 4’s Today Programme to justify their actions. In response to the accusations of a relatively hostile panel of commentators, the students announced that the holiday was in fact an elaborate simulation; the photos, tickets and suntans were all fakes. The turquoise Mediterranean that featured so heavily in the holidays snaps was in fact the North Sea just along the coast from Scarborough. The Spanish blue skies were created with a lens filter, and the sun-kissed swimming pool – the iconic symbol of a holiday abroad – was actually located in suburban Leeds.

At least eight distilleries currently produce it, and there are 26 whisky distilleries across England in various stages of development. Though England is not well known for whisky, distillers operated in London, Liverpool and Bristol until the late 19th century, after which production of English single malt whisky ceased until 2003.Cornish take on Scotch, BBC News, Thursday, 1 May 2003. Since then, English whisky has experienced a resurgence in production. History England, like Scotland, has a history of producing single malt whisky. However, the production of English single malt whisky ceased around 1905 with the closure of Lea Valley Distillery, in Stratford, London, by the Distillers Company Limited, one of the forerunners of Diageo. In the 1887 book The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom by Alfred Barnard, the following English distilleries were listed:English Whisky page at Royal Mile Whiskies commercial website. * Lea Valley Distillery, Stratford, Essex (founded in the late 19th century) — produced both grain and malt whisky. * Bank Hall Distillery (Liverpool) — produced grain and malt whisky. * Bristol Distillery (founded in the 17th century) — produced grain whisky which was \\"sent to Scotland and Ireland to make a Blended Scotch and Irish whisky, for whisky purpose it is specially adapted, and stands in high favour\\". * Vauxhall Distillery in Liverpool (founded in 1781) — produced grain whisky. In 2013 The London Distillery Company began production of the first single malt whisky in London since Lea Valley Distillery closed in 1903. Two other English distilleries, also producing whisky by 2014, were The Lakes Distillery and The Cotswolds Distillery. Distilleries = The Lakes Distillery = On the shore of Bassenthwaite Lake, near Keswick in The Lake District UNESCO World Heritage Site, The Lakes Distillery is an award-winning whisky distillery attracting over 100,000 visitors each year. In September 2019, The Lakes released The Whiskymaker's Reserve No.1, the distillery's first widely available single malt whisky. =Bimber Distillery= An independent distillery in east London founded 2016. The distillery released its inaugural single malt whisky in September 2019, with its 1,000 bottle limited release selling out in three hours. Further releases of a range of single malt whisky are due in 2020. =Hicks & Healey= In 2003 two of Cornwall's drinks producers, St Austell Brewery and Healey's Cyder Farm, announced that they had begun to produce the first whisky in England for almost a century. In September 2011 the partnership released a 7-year old single malt and opted to use the spelling \\"whiskey\\". Whisky commentator and author of The Whisky Bible, Jim Murray, described the whiskey as \\"among the best debut bottlings of the last decade\\". =St George's Distillery= St George's Distillery in Roudham, Norfolk, began production in 2006. The company founder James Nelstrop described it as a 45-year-old dream to make whisky in Norfolk and said that barley has historically been sent from Norfolk to Scotland to make whisky.English whisky bottled for first time in a century, BBC news, 10 December 2009. =The Cotswolds Distillery= The Cotswolds Distillery was established in 2014, and was the first full-scale distillery to be located in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Situated in a 5-acre site in Stourton in the North Cotswolds, its focus is distilling single malt whisky. It is one of only six distilleries producing English whisky. =The London Distillery Company= The London Distillery Company (TLDC) was based in a former dairy cold room in Battersea, London until December 2015 before moving to a railway arch in Bermondsey. TLDC was registered with Companies House in July 2011 by Darren Rook,Whisky Guy whisky blog and investor and former microbrewery owner, Nick Taylor. =East London Liquor Company= East London Liquor Company is based in a building that was once a glue factory in Bow Wharf, East London. = Forest Distillery = The Forest Distillery is a multi-award winning, family owned distillery based in a 17th century barn, 1200ft above sea level in the Peak District National Park. Established by Karl & Lindsay Bond in 2014, they distill Single Malt English Whisky named \\"Forest Whisky\\", whilst also distilling Forest Gin and several other products. Forest Distillery also releases occasional casks of whisky from other distilleries as private bottling, and also create their own blended range. =Wharf Distillery= Wharf Distillery is an independent small batch distillery founded in 2014 by Laurence Conisbee to produce apple brandy, Aeppel Drenc, from its own cider (Virtual Orchard Cider). The distillery uses 300 litre, hand-beaten copper pot alembic stills from Portugal. Their range now includes gin Safine Drenc, vodka Gadan Drenc, and a range of single malts Fyr Drenc. Later in 2019 they plan to introduce a dark rum. Their first whisky, named Cattle Creep after the narrow tunnel passing under the nearby Grand Union canal, was finally released in January 2019. Matured in a Madeira cask, this very limited release was bottled at 42.9% with a cask strength Distiller's Cut at 58.8% being made available in June 2019. The release of their whisky will make them England's smallest whisky distillery. The distillery takes its name from its original location on Galleon Wharf alongside the Grand Union canal, although it is currently located in the village of Potterspury, Northamptonshire. =Spirit of Yorkshire Distillery= Based in Humanby, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Partnered with the Woldtop Brewery Co., this distillery has been producing single malt in a pair of classic Forsyth stills since May 2016. 'Maturing spirit' at various stages has been released by the distillery, with the first bottles of their single malt whisky due for release in 2019. Emphasis is on quality, and innovation in wood management. =Cooper King Distillery= Cooper King Distillery is an independent English whisky and gin distillery based in Sutton on the Forest, Yorkshire, which was founded after the owners spent time living in Tasmania and became inspired by the Australian whisky industry. Established in 2016 by co-founders Christopher Jaume and Dr Abbie Neilson, the distillery started producing gin in early 2018 and will cask their single malt whisky in the summer of 2018. It is the country’s first self-built whisky and gin distillery. Cooper King’s single malt whisky is produced using a 900 litre Tasmanian-made copper pot still the only one of its kind outside Australasia, using Yorkshire barley, and aged in a variety of casks including ex-port, ex-sherry, and ex-bourbon. The distillery is powered by 100% renewable energy. Casks for the distillery are handmade at White Rose Cooperage by Alastair Simms, one of England’s last master coopers. The distillery is named after owner Chris Jaume’s great-great-grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cooper King, who traced the family’s history back to Yorkshire in 1030 AD.

Facial clefts is a collective term for all sorts of clefts. All structures like bone, soft tissue, skin etc. can be affected. Facial clefts are extremely rare congenital anomalies. There are many variations of a type of clefting and classifications are needed to describe and classify all types of clefting. Facial clefts hardly ever occur isolated; most of the time there is an overlap of adjacent facial clefts.  Classifications  There are different classifications about facial clefts. Two of the most used classifications are the Tessier classification and the Van der Meulen classification. Tessier is based on the anatomical position of the cleft and Van der Meulen classification is based on the embryogenesis. = Tessier classification = Tessier classification. Left: boney clefts, Right: Soft tissue clefts. In 1976 Paul Tessier published a classification on facial clefts based on the anatomical position of the clefts. The different types of Tessier clefts are numbered 0 to 14. These 15 different types of clefts can be put into 4 groups, based on their position:Fearon, JA et al. \\"Rare Craniofacial Clefts: A surgical Classification\\", J Craniofac Surg. 2008 Jan;19(1):110-2, midline clefts, paramedian clefts, orbital clefts and lateral clefts. The Tessier classification describes the clefts at soft tissue level as well as at bone level, because it appears that the soft tissue clefts can have a slightly different location on the face than the bony clefts.  Midline clefts  The midline clefts are Tessier number 0 (\\"median craniofacial dysplasia\\"), number 14 (frontonasal dysplasia), and number 30 (\\"lower midline facial cleft\\", also known as \\"median mandibular cleft\\"). These clefts bisect the face vertically through the midline. Tessier number 0 bisects the maxilla and the nose, Tessier number 14 comes between the nose and the frontal bone. The Tessier number 30 facial cleft is through the tongue, lower lip and mandible. The tongue may be absent, hypoplastic, bifid, or even duplicated. People with this condition may be tongue-tied.  Paramedian clefts  Tessier number 1, 2, 12 and 13 are the paramedian clefts. These clefts are quite similar to the midline clefts, but they are further away from the midline of the face. Tessier number 1 and 2 both come through the maxilla and the nose, in which Tessier number 2 is further from the midline (lateral) than number 1. Tessier number 12 is in extent of number 2, positioned between nose and frontal bone, while Tessier number 13 is in extent of number 1, also running between nose and forehead. Both 12 and 13 run between the midline and the orbit.  Orbital clefts  Tessier number 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 11 are orbital clefts. These clefts all have the involvement of the orbit. Tessier number 3, 4, and 5 are positioned through the maxilla and the orbital floor. Tessier number 9, 10 and 11 are positioned between the upper side of the orbit and the forehead or between the upper side of the orbit and the temple of the head. Like the other clefts, Tessier number 11 is in extent to number 3, number 10 is in extent to number 4 and number 9 is in extent to number 5.  Lateral clefts  The lateral clefts are the clefts which are positioned horizontally on the face. These are Tessier number 6, 7 and 8. Tessier number 6 runs from the orbit to the cheek bone. Tessier number 7 is positioned on the line between the corner of the mouth and the ear. A possible lateral cleft comes from the corner of the mouth towards the ear, which gives the impression that the mouth is bigger. It’s also possible that the cleft begins at the ear and runs towards the mouth. Tessier number 8 runs from the outer corner of the eye towards the ear. The combination of a Tessier number 6-7-8 is seen in the Treacher Collins syndrome. Tessier number 7 is more related to hemifacial microsomia and number 8 is more related to Goldenhar syndrome. = Van der Meulen classification = Van der Meulen classification divides different types of clefts based on where the development arrest occurs in the embryogenesis. A primary cleft can occur in an early stage of the development of the face (17 mm length of the embryo). The developments arrests can be divided in four different location groups: internasal, nasal, nasalmaxillar and maxillar. The maxillar location can be subdivided in median and lateral clefts. File: Van_der_meulen_-_internasal_dysplasia.jpg  Internasal dysplasia File: Nasal_dysplasia.jpg  Nasal dysplasia File: Nasalmaxillary_dysplasia.jpg  Nasomaxillary dysplasia File: Maxillary_dysplasia.jpg  Maxillary dysplasia  Internasal dysplasia  Internasal dysplasia is caused by a development arrest before the union of the both nasal halves. These clefts are characterized by a median cleft lip, a median notch of the cupid's bow or a duplication of the labial frenulum. Besides the median cleft lip, hypertelorism can be seen in these clefts. Also sometimes there can be an underdevelopment of the premaxilla.  Nasal dysplasia  Nasal dysplasia or nasoschisis is caused by a development arrest of the lateral side of the nose, resulting in a cleft in one of the nasal halves. The nasal septum and cavity can be involved, though this is rare. Nasoschisis is also characterized by hypertelorism.  Nasomaxillary dysplasia  Nasomaxillary dysplasia is caused by a development arrest at the junction of the lateral side of the nose and the maxilla, which results in a complete or non-complete cleft between the nose and the orbital floor (nasoocular cleft) or between the mouth, nose and the orbital floor (oronasal- ocular cleft). The development of the lip is normal.  Maxillary dysplasia  Maxillary dysplasia can manifest itself on two different locations in the maxilla: in the medial or the lateral part of the maxilla. * Median maxillary dysplasia is caused by a development failure of the medial part of the maxillary ossification centers. This results in secondary clefting of the lip, philtrum and palate. Clefting from the maxilla to the orbital floor has also been reported. * Lateral maxillary dysplasia is caused by a development failure of the lateral part of the maxillary ossification centers, which also results in secondary clefting of the lip and palate. Clefting of the lateral part of the lower eyelid is typical for lateral maxillary dysplasia. Causes It is possible that facial clefts are caused by a disorder in the migration of neural crest cells. Another theory is that facial clefts are caused by failure of the fusion process and failure of inwards growth of the mesoderm. Other theories are that genetics play a part in the development of facial clefts or that they are caused by amniotic bands. = Genetics =  Overview  Around one in 700 individuals are born with craniofacial clefts.Leslie, E.J., and Marazita, M.L. (2013). Genetics of Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate. Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet 163, 246–258. There are multiple genetic and environmental factors which contribute to craniofacial development. Within craniofacial disorders and abnormalities, orofacial clefts, and specifically cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP) are the most common in humans. Occurrences of CL/P are most often (around seventy percent of cases) isolated and nonsyndromic, meaning they are not associated with a syndrome or inherited genetic conditions.Yoon, A.J., Pham, B.N., and Dipple, K.M. (2016). Genetic Screening in Patients with Craniofacial Malformations. J Pediatr Genet 5, 220–224. Around thirty percent occur with other structural variances, and over 500 syndromes have been identified in which clefting is a principal feature. Clefting can result from teratogens, an agent that disrupts embryo development such as, radiation, maternal infection, chemicals, or drugs. Chromosomal abnormalities or mutations at single gene loci have also contributed to clefting development. Genetic causes are linked with most craniofacial syndromes, and CL/P and other orofacial clefts are recognized as heterogeneous disorders, meaning there are multiple recognized causes.Cohen, M.M. (2002). Malformations of the craniofacial region: evolutionary, embryonic, genetic, and clinical perspectives. Am. J. Med. Genet. 115, 245–268. Orofacial clefts have great phenotypic diversity, and their associated genetic environments have called for vast research and investigation.  Environmental Interaction  Craniofacial disorders have high variance in phenotypic expression, and researchers have suggested this variance could be due to interactions between the mutated/deviated genes and other genes, along with interactions with environmental factors.Weinberg, Seth M., Robert Cornell, and Elizabeth J. Leslie. 2018. “Craniofacial Genetics: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going?” PLoS Genetics 14 (6): e1007438. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007438.Roosenboom, Jasmien, Greet Hens, Brooke C. Mattern, Mark D. Shriver, and Peter Claes. 2016. “Exploring the Underlying Genetics of Craniofacial Morphology through Various Sources of Knowledge.” Edited by Ilker ERCAN. BioMed Research International 2016 (December): 3054578. https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/3054578. Environmental causes have been found to contribute to craniofacial clefting, however, these are still influenced by and supported by genetic factors. Many studies, for example, have linked maternal smoking to increased CLP risk; however, the increased risk suggests that genes in metabolic pathways could still contribute to susceptibility or formation of CL/P.Dixon, M.J., Marazita, M.L., Beaty, T.H., and Murray, J.C. (2011). Cleft lip and palate: synthesizing genetic and environmental influences. Nat Rev Genet 12, 167–178.  Development and Inheritance  The craniofacial complex begins its progress in the fourth week of development, and results from neural crest cells migrating to form and fuse the facial primordia. Failures or deviations in this process result in craniofacial clefts, either CL or CP. The range of variation in phenotype aligns with ancestry. Studies have found increased amounts of clefting in the relatives of patients with clefts, suggesting genetic factors are the underlying cause for CL/P. Inheritance has a known and significant role in human craniofacial morphology. This is supported through cephalometric and anthropometric comparisons of family members including between triplets, twins, siblings, and parents and children.The Role of Genetics in Craniofacial Morphology and Growth  Annual Review of Anthropology.  Genetic Experimentation  Genetic factors of craniofacial clefting can be investigated and tracked through several methods including sequencing in humans, Genome-wide association studies (GWAs), fate mapping, expression analysis, and animal studies (knockout experiments or models with clefting from chemical mutagenesis).Facebase.org Twin studies and familial clustering have also revealed that facial structure and formation are genetically linked. Several genes have been associated with craniofacial disorders through experimentation, including sequencing Mendelian clefting syndromes. Over 25 loci have been identified as potential influencers of craniofacial clefts across populations.  Linked Genes  The transforming growth factor (TGF) family has provided multiple candidate genes linked with craniofacial development and malformation.Genetic and Teratogenic Approaches To Craniofacial Development - D.L. Young, R.A. Schneider, D. Hu, J.A. Helms, 2000.Wilkie, A.O., and Morriss-Kay, G.M. (2001). Genetics of craniofacial development and malformation. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2, 458–468. TGF is involved in cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation, as well as regulating the extracellular matrix. Another gene that has been flagged as causal for craniofacial disorders, including CL/P, is interferon regulatory factor 6 or, IRF6.SPECC1L deficiency results in increased adherens junction stability and reduced cranial neural crest cell delamination. - PubMed - NCBI. Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude syndrome, the most common clefting syndrome. Ventral anterior homeobox 1, VAX1, and noggin, NOG, were identified with genome-wide significance for contributing to CL/P. Additionally, mutations in SPECC1L have recently been identified as influential to facial structure formation, and as causal for syndromic facial clefting.Kruszka, P., Li, D., Harr, M.H., Wilson, N.R., Swarr, D., McCormick, E.M., Chiavacci, R.M., Li, M., Martinez, A.F., Hart, R.A., et al. (2015). Mutations in SPECC1L, encoding sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1-like, are found in some cases of autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome. J. Med. Genet. 52, 104–110. Nonsyndromic CL/P has been associated with the transcription factor forkhead box protein E1 (FOXE1), as mutations have resulted in cases of CL/P in mice. Other genes which have been found to interact with or contribute to craniofacial clefting include FGFRs, TWIST, MSXs, GREM1, TCOF1, PAXs, MAFB, ABCA4, and WNT allowing great cause for more research into the genetic basis for craniofacial disorders.  Prevention  Because the cause of facial clefts still is unclear, it is difficult to say what may prevent children being born with facial clefts. It seems that folic acid contributes to lowering the risk of a child being born with a facial cleft.  Treatment  There is no single strategy for treatment of facial clefts, because of the large amount of variation in these clefts. Which kind of surgery is used depends on the type of clefting and which structures are involved. There is much discussion about the timing of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue. The problem with early reconstruction is the recurrence of the deformity due to the intrinsic restricted growth. This requires additional operations at a later age to make sure all parts of the face are in proportion. A disadvantage of early bone reconstruction is the chance to damage the tooth germs, which are located in the maxilla, just under the orbit. The soft tissue reconstruction can be done at an early age, but only if the used skin flap can be used again during a second operation. The timing of the operation depends on the urgency of the underlying condition. If the operation is necessary to function properly, it should be done at early age. The best aesthetic result is achieved when the incisions are positioned in areas which attract the least attention (they cover up the scars). If, however, the function of a part of the face isn’t damaged, the operation depends on psychological factors and the facial area of reconstruction. The treatment plan of a facial cleft is planned right after diagnosis. This plan includes every operation needed in the first 18 years of the patients life to reconstruct the face fully. In this plan, a difference is made between problems that need to be solved to improve the health of the patient (coloboma) and problems that need to be solved for a better cosmetic result (hypertelorism). The treatment of the facial clefts can be divided in different areas of the face: the cranial anomalies, the orbital and eye anomalies, the nose anomalies, the midface anomalies and the mouth anomalies. = Treatment of the cranial anomalies = The most common cranial anomaly seen in combination with facial clefts is encephalocele.  Encephalocele  The treatment of encephalocele is based on surgery to repair the bony gap and provide adequate protection of the underlying brain. The question remains if the external brain tissue should be put back into the skull or if it is possible to cut off that piece of brain tissue, because its claimed that the external piece of brain tissue often isn’t functional, with the exception of a basal encephalocele, in which the pituitary gland can be found in the mouth. = Treatment of orbital / eye anomalies = The most common orbital /eye anomalies seen in children with facial clefts are colobomas and vertical dystopia.  Coloboma  The coloboma which occurs often in facial clefts is a cleft in the lower or upper eyelid. This should be closed as soon as possible, to prevent drought of the eye and a consecutive loss of vision.Patipa M et al., \\"Surgical management of congenital eyelid coloboma\\", Ophthalmic Surg. 1982 Mar;13(3):212-216  Vertical orbital dystopia  Vertical orbital dystopia can occur in facial clefts when the orbital floor and/or the maxilla is involved in the cleft. Vertical orbital dystopia means that the eyes do not lay on the same horizontal line in the face (one eye is positioned lower than the other). The treatment is based on the reconstruction of this orbital floor, by either closing the boney cleft or reconstructing the orbital floor using a bone graft.  Hypertelorism  There are many types of operations which can be performed to treat a hypertelorism. 2 options are: box osteotomy and facial bipartitionMarchad D & Arnaud E, \\"Midface surgery from Tessier to distraction\\", Childs Nerv Syst. 1999 Nov;15(11-12):681-94, (also referred to as a median fasciotomy). The goal of the box osteotomy is to bring the orbits closer together by removing a part of the bone between the orbits, to detach both orbits from the surrounding bone structures and move both orbits more to the centre of the face. The goal of the facial bipartition is not only to bring the orbits closer together, but also to create more space in the maxilla. This can be done by splitting the maxilla and the frontal bone, remove a triangular shaped piece of bone from the forehead and nasal bones and pulling the two pieces of forehead together. Not only will the hypertelorism be solved by pulling the frontal bone closer together, but because of this pulling, the space between the both parts of the maxilla will become wider. File: Picture_box_osteotomy.jpg Box Osteotomy File: Picture_median_fasciotomy.jpg  Facial Bipartition = Treatment of nose anomalies = The nose anomalies found in facial clefts vary. The main goal of the treatment is to reconstruct the nose to get a functional and esthetic acceptable result. A few possible treatment options are to reconstruct the nose with a forehead flap or reconstruct the nasal dorsum with a bone graft, for example a rib graft. The nasal reconstruction with a forehead flap is based on the repositioning of a skin flap from the forehead to the nose. A possible downside of this reconstruction is that once you performed it at a younger age, you can’t lengthen the flap at a later stage. A second operation is often needed if the operation is done on early age, because the nose has a restricted growth in the cleft area. Repair of the ala (wing of the nose) often requires the inset of cartilage graft, commonly taken from the ear. = Treatment of midface anomalies = The treatment of soft tissue parts of midface anomalies is often a reconstruction from a skin flap of the cheek. This skinflap can be used for other operations in the further, as it can be raised again and transposed again. In the treatment of midface anomalies there are generally more operations needed. Bone tissue reconstruction of the midface often occurs later than the soft tissue reconstruction. The most common method to reconstruct the midface is by using the fracture/ incision lines described by René Le Fort. When the cleft involves the maxilla, it is likely that the impaired growth will result in a smaller maxillary bone in all 3 dimensions (height, projection, width). = Treatment of mouth anomalies = There are several options for treatment of mouth anomalies like Tessier cleft number 2-3-7 . These clefts are also seen in various syndromes like Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia, which makes the treatment much more complicated. In this case, treatment of mouth anomalies is a part of the treatment of the syndrome.

Biography Thomas Murfyn was a native of Ely, Cambridgeshire, and son of George Murfyn. He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Skinners in the City of London, who served as Sheriff of London from 1511 to 1512, and as Lord Mayor of London from 1518 to 1519. Mark Noble claimed that Murfyn was probably not knighted until after his election to the mayoralty. Although Murfyn is often referred to in later documents as Sir Thomas Murfyn, there appears to be no record of his knighthood. It became common practice after Thomas Muryfn's mayoralty for Lord Mayors of London to be knighted and this may be one reason why later documents refer to him as \\"Sir\\".: John Stow in the year 1519, observed that after that time it was usual to knight the lord mayor when elected. The misunderstanding may also be due to the translation of the form of address \\"Dominus\\" (a term of courtesy used in reference to an official) as \\"Sir\\". In his will, which was made on 2 September 1523 and proved in London on 15 October 1523, Murfyn refers to himself as \\"Thomas Mirfyn citizein and Alderman of the citie of London\\". The memorial to the graves lost in the Great Fire of London at St Paul's Cathedral, which lists \\"Sir Thomas Miryfn\\", may be perpetuating this error rather than evidence of a knighthood. Family Thomas married firstly, Alice Marshall, by whom he had thirteen children:Only four of Thomas Murfyn's fourteen children: Thomas, John, George, Thomas, John, Frances, Richard, John, Robert, Edward, Bartholomew, Margaret, Mary by Dame Alice and Frances by Dame Elizabeth, were beneficiaries of his will.

Overview Modern lines characterized the architecture of the Québec Pavilion. Its exterior walls were made of glass; by day, these were enormous rectangular mirrors and, by night, an illuminated display case. Surrounded by water, the structure was accessible by a footbridge. Visitors then entered by large elevators; inside the pavilion. The pavilion's modern architecture and interior exhibit were in sharp contrast to the traditional image Canadians then had of this province. The exhibits focusing on urbanization, industrialization, business and education presented Quebec as a province with its eye on the future. Natural resources, forestry and water in particular were also presented as growth industries. In this reflection of Quebec society, the minimalist display methods themselves were an attraction: thousands of coloured steel cubes were used as part of the exhibits which was bathed in an electronic score by Quebec composer Gilles Tremblay in which synthetized whir, twitter and roar complemented the visual suggestions. High overhead, the distinctive soundtracks collided and coalesced into a contrapuntal aural landscape. The building and the adjacent French pavilion are now part of the Montreal Casino. Architecture and exhibition design The Québec Pavilion displayed a minimal approach to form. The flawless construction, by Montreal architects Papineau Gérin-Lajoie Le Blanc and Luc Durand, composed of concrete floors and Vierendeel structural steel supported by four steel towers, left the viewer without a doubt of the pavilion’s harmonious and sophisticated assembly. The avant-garde design of the Québec Pavilion’s exhibition was the work of Swiss designer, Gustave Maeder. The themes were integrated to the pavilion's the modern architecture through cubic modules. The cubes became the receptacles for exhibition items or became themselves the object of the exhibits through sculptural form. The themes explored: Man’s Challenge, Man’s Struggle, and Drive, defined the beginning of Quebec’s people’s trajectory towards the future. The 4,200 x 24 inch (60cm) sided steel cubes took on different shapes. The theme of Challenge was experienced by the visitors as they were taken up the cylindrical elevators up to the mezzanine floor. In this journey, the visitors witnessed a kaleidoscopic show expressing the passing of the seasons which represented the challenge which the original French settlers encountered. From the mezzanine, visitors got an overview of the theme of Struggle by walking the downward sloping ramp. In clockwise order, the visitor saw representations of Quebec’s Conquest of nature; its Water, Forest, Earth, and Underground which would subsequently be transformed by Industry. Once on the ground floor, the visitor found himself in visiting the contemporary lifestyle of Montreal, then Canada's metropolis. Finally, visitors would wander through the exhibits and at the center of the pavilion was the theme Drive; a look into the province's potential. The path the visitors walked took on an important meaning, they were led on a promenade that allowed them to experience Quebec’s history. Films, photographs and transparencies were also used to visualize Quebec’s social, political, cultural and economical ripening. Recognition The Quebec Pavilion Exhibition in 1967 Visiting Montreal in April 1967, Ada Louise Huxtable, The New York Times architecture critic praised the Québec Pavilion calling it the Barcelona Pavilion of Expo 67: > \\"Quebec is the Barcelona Pavilion of 1967... [The Quebec Pavilion] combines > an exceptionally refined work of contemporary architecture with an > exhibition design that is a three-dimensional sensory abstraction of sight > and electronic sound that says, suddenly, and stunningly, what a 1967 > exhibit should be\\". Toronto Star’s Robert Fulford called it: > \\"Cool and restrained and sophisticated…Rarely can there ever have been a > large exhibition so pure, so rarified as this one… The severe spirit of > Mondrian fills the Quebec Pavilion\\".

The line would be long and be a northern extension of the Bothnia Line, which opened in 2010. The planned extension is expected to improve accessibility between larger cities along Sweden's coast and handle 1.6 million passengers per year. Currently, the area is served by the Main Line Through Upper Norrland, which is located inland and with branch lines connected to various towns along the coast. To the north, the line will connect with the Main Line Through Upper Norrland and onwards along the Haparanda Line to connect to the Barents Region and the Finnish railway network. It will also connect to the Iron Ore Line. The project is estimated to cost 23 billion Swedish kronor (SEK). The line will connect to Stockholm via the Bothnia Line, the Ådalen Line and the East Coast Line.

An upgrade of the Main Line has been considered, but because of the curvy right-of-way most of the line would have to be built in an all-new right-of-way, which would raise costs to about the same as the North Bothnia Line. In addition, the Main Line's inland route makes it unsuitable for regional passenger services and gives longer distances. Travel time from Umeå to Luleå for passenger trains will be 90 minutes, compared to over 4 hours for buses or trains today.

History In 2009, a major division was a result of the rejection, by a large percentage of members (approximately 2,400 individuals), of an unprecedented committee report adopted by the 2009 Annual Meeting held near Waterford, CA. The report stated in part, \\"Members of the Old German Baptist Brethren Church in full fellowship and in good standing with the Church, believe and agree that the Old German Baptist Brethren’s interpretation of NT doctrine is scriptural and has been prompted by the Holy Spirit and it is their mind to remain in this fellowship and to teach, support and promote the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. It will be expected that members hearing the reading of this report will be willing to accept the same.\\" No positions on specific questions of doctrine or church practice before the Conference were addressed in the Report, though the general understanding was that it asked for an affirmation of loyalty to traditional doctrine and practice as understood by the more traditional/conservative arm of membership. Conference representatives were sent to each district (congregation) in the brotherhood to determine the willingness of each member to accept the report. Those who refused to accept the report gave their names, which were recorded and sent to the secretary of the standing committee for processing, and they were disfellowshipped (ie excommunicated). Members who refused to accept the Report were given 60 days to reconsider their decision without repercussion. Those who remained silent or did not attend the meetings were assumed to be in agreement or willing to submit to the decision, and were retained as members. A majority of the members who did not accept the Report and were subsequently disfellowshipped participated in the re-organization of a new body, which was organized at a July 3, 2009, meeting in Troy, Ohio, called the Old German Baptist Brethren, New Conference. Several fundamental disagreements identified by the New Conference and adherents included: allowing regular group Bible studies outside of the Sunday worship setting; permitting open outreach & mission efforts;Outreach Statement use of email and the Internet;Technology Report Scriptural application of church discipline as guided by Matthew 18; and preservation of the historical Brethren practice of \\"taking the voice\\" (or vote) of every member after a thorough discussion of each issue (no discussion was permitted upon presentation of the 2009 Report, and only a vote of affirmation was allowed). The New Conference Original Polity Statement,Polity Statement, Old German Baptist Brethren Church (New Conference) July 3, 2009 declares that \\"the church must never be elevated to a place of equality with Jesus Christ,\\" reflecting the New Conference's somewhat more individualistic approach to faith, following personal Biblical convictions (in opposition to the parent body's stronger emphasis on unity through mutual accountability and top-down legislating practical applications of theology). The 2018 Conference approved an updated Polity Statement.Current Polity Statement, Old German Baptist Brethren Church (New Conference) Approved by Conference in 2018. The majority of the remainder of the departing members have joined similar existing groups such as the Old Brethren or Dunkard Brethren, or moved on to more mainstream evangelical church fellowships.

Limited vehicular access is also provided to French Island from Corinella, via a privately operated barge. History Just to the east of the present town, a settlement was founded in 1826 from Sydney in response to a concern for possible French territorial claims. In that year Dumont d'Urville in command of the corvette Astrolabe examined Western Port during his scientific voyage, arousing some suspicion.The Exploration of Westernport, Western Port Seagrass Partnership 2008, http://www.seagrass.com.au/downloads/PDFs/Exploration_WP.pdf Authorities in Sydney had also recently received reports from explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, who mistakenly believed they had reached Western Port in 1824, when in fact they had arrived at Corio Bay many kilometres to the west. A contingent of soldiers and 21 convicts under the command of Captain Wright, accompanied by Hovell, was dispatched to forestall any French incursion. A small military settlement called Fort Dumaresq was established near the present-day site of Rhyll on the north coast of Phillip Island. Lack of fresh water proved a problem and the outpost was moved to Corinella, then called Settlement Point. Hovell's subsequent report claiming Western Port was unsuitable for agriculture, owing to poor soil and lack of fresh water, and the absence of any French, led to the abandonment of the settlements in 1828. The buildings were burnt to prevent use by escaped convicts. A memorial cairn in Jamieson Street marks the site of the original settlement, and another monument at the end of Smythe Street commemorates Paul Edmund de Strzelecki's exploration in 1840.Visit Corinella http://www.visitcorinella.com/topic/index.html The 1826-8 Corinella was subject to extensive archaeological investigations in the late 1970s by the Victoria Archaeological Survey led by Peter Coutts.

It means The Pardoner, The Most Forgiving, The Effacing, The Eliminator of Sins. It is part of the 99 Names of God, by which Muslims regard God, and it is described in Qur'ān and Sunnah.  Descriptive meaning of the name  * The One who blots out and leaves no trace of any sin or fault. * The One who passes over and absolves any fault. * The One who can remove and obliterate all traces of wrong actions. * The One who can make any sin, error or fault disappear. Linguistic translation of Afuw Afuw is said to come from the root 'a-f-a which has the following classical Arabic connotations: * to forgive, pardon * to pass over, forgo, absolve * to obliterate all traces, efface, remove * to kill-off, allow to die * to turn away from punishing, not see, annul * to make unapparent, imperceptible * to give spontaneously, to give without constraint * to give more than what is due Deeper explanation Traditionally, it is translated as \\"Forgiver\\" and \\"Pardoner\\". However, according to the book \\"Al- Maqsad Al-Asna fi Sharah Asma' Allahu al-Husna\\" (aka The best means in explaining Allah's Beautiful Names), Imam Al Ghazali defines this Attribute as The One Who Erases Sin. To have a better understanding how Al-Afuw differs from other Attributes such as Al-Ghaffar and Al-Ghaffur, the following is an excerpt from the translation of Imam Al Ghazali's work by Robert Charles Stade: \\"Al-Afu is the One Who erases sins and disregards acts of disobedience. This concept approximates the sense of Al-Ghafur, (the One Who forgives much), though the former is more far-reaching than the latter. For Al-Ghufran indicates a veiling (of the sin) whereas Al-Afu indicates an erasing, and the erasing (of sin) is more far-reaching (than the simple veiling of it).\\" Another way to better understand this Attribute is to consider the metaphor which the classical Arabic dictionary, Taj al-Arûs, offers wherein 'afûw is said to be like the desert wind completely obliterating footprints in the sand. The same type of metaphor is used in the book, \\"Physicians of the Heart: A Sufi View of the 99 Names of Allah\\". The author states: \\"Let’s begin with a physical metaphor that is part of the word’s root meaning: Afu til … (Arabic?). This is an image of the wind blowing across the desert vastness and completely erasing all the tracks in the sand. It is as if no one had ever walked there. Such a fundamental image in the root of the word shows us that with al-‘Afuw, you do not even notice the fault.\\" Occurrence in Quran The Name of Allah, Al-’Afuw, can be found in the Quran five times. It is linked several times with Al-Ghafoor (4:43, 4:99, 22:60, 58:2) and once with Al- Qadeer (4:149). Occurrence in Hadith In At-Tirmidhi by Imam Tirmidhi in Book 9, Hadith 1195, it is mentioned: Hazrat Aisha (R.A) asked Prophet Muhammad: \\"O Messenger of Allah! If I realize Lailat-ul-Qadr (Night of Decree), what should I supplicate in it?\\" He (ﷺ) replied, \\"You should supplicate: Allahumma innaka 'afuwwun, tuhibbul-'afwa, fa'fu 'anni الْلَّهُمَّ اِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنَّي 'O Allah, You are The Forgiver, You Love Forgiveness, so Forgive me'.

In 1848 Samuel Gobat, Bishop of Jerusalem, opened the cemetery and dedicated it as ecumenical graveyard for congregants of Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist) and old Catholic faith. Since its original beneficiary, the Bishopric of Jerusalem was maintained as a joint venture of the Anglican Church of England and the Evangelical Church in Prussia, a united Protestant Landeskirche of Lutheran and Reformed congregations, until 1886, the Jerusalem Lutheran congregation preserved a right to bury congregants there also after the Jerusalem Bishopric had become a solely Anglican diocese. Location Old City of Jerusalem with the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery south of the city walls (close to remnants of former walls in rose colour). The cemetery is located on the southwestern slope of Mount Zion in Jerusalem, southerly surrounded by the street Ma'alei haShalom (מעלי השלום). Mount Zion Cemetery is reached passing the site of the former Bishop Gobat School, since 1967 housing the Jerusalem University College, founded as American Institute of Holy Land Studies in 1957. ּBetween 1948 and 1967 the congregations using the cemetery, with most of their congregants living in then East Jerusalem, had very complicated access to the cemetery then located in what was West Jerusalem.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 43. So in those years a further ecumenical Protestant cemetery in Beit Safafa, Jarmaleh Cemetery, was opened on the road to Gush Etzion opposite the Tantur Ecumenical Institute for Theological Studies.

In June of that year he reported that, with the collaboration of Vice-Consul Young, he had located a suitable plot of land on Mount Zion that would meet this need, but that he had postponed closing the deal until matters were clarified about land acquired earlier for residential construction.\\"Yaron Perry (ירון פרי), see Bibliography for details, p. 64. However, British Vice-Consul William Tanner Young then succeeded to acquire another site for the cemetery: \\"It is a Parallelogram of long and broad – It is 335 paces West of the Jaffa Gate and 182 paces East of that Turkish Burial- ground which is in the vicinity of the Upper Pool of Gihon, North West of the [Old] City.\\"William Tanner Young in a letter of 30 May 1844 to British Foreign Secretary George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, here after Yaron Perry (ירון פרי), see Bibliography for details, pp. 65 and 88.

Among those buried in this [first] cemetery were [Missionary Ferdinand Christian] Ewald’s wife[, Mary Ann (b. 1819),] in January 1844 and Bishop Alexander in December 1845. However, because of the proximity to the Muslim cemetery and all the problems this entailed, the small British community in the city was forced to find a new site. In January 1844, during negotiations with Constantinople about the firman for building the [Christ] church, Nicolayson also asked the Sublime Porte for a permit to buy a plot of land for a cemetery on Mount Zion outside the city walls, where other Christian burial grounds were situated.\\"Yaron Perry (ירון פרי), see Bibliography for details, p. 65. Additions in brackets not in the original. The other Christian burialgrounds on Mount Zion are an Armenian, a Greek Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Franciscan cemetery, the latter containing also the grave of Oskar Schindler. =Mount Zion= \\"Only in spring of 1848 did the British consul general in Constantinople and his colleague in Jerusalem,[ James Finn,] receive a firman to purchase a cemetery plot for the Protestant community.\\" Prepared by Nicolayson, later buried there, and with the support of Hugh Rose, British consul-general for Syria, and the Mutasarrıf of Jerusalem, Zarif Pasha, Bishop Gobat acquired the tract of land on Mount Zion in the same year, paying £ 350 (= 4,200 French francs) for the land, its enclosure and levelling.Cf. Samuel Gobat's annual episcopal report of 30 October 1848, published in: Samuel Gobat, Samuel Gobat, Evangelischer Bischof in Jerusalem – Sein Leben und sein Wirken meist nach seinen eigenen Aufzeichnungen: mit Gobat's und seiner Frau Bildern in Stahlstich und 8 Landschaften in Holzschnitt, Basel: Spittler, 1884, p. 302 Gobat financed the expenses with private funds earlier donated by Britons, Germans and Swiss, of which by December the British Government recovered £100 and later private British donators another £46.2.0, while Prussians did not specifically contribute to the project at that time. Mount Zion Cemetery replaced the old cemetery West of Jaffa Gate. So Gobat transferred the graves from there to the new cemetery on Mount Zion.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 2 and 4 By the end of November 1848 it was completely enclosed by a wall. Between early 1850 and September 1852 Gustav Thiel (1825–1907) and his wife Maria Katharina Großsteinbeck (1826–1862) were employed as gardeners and guards of Mount Zion Cemetery at an annual income of 75 taler.On 4 February 1850 they had arrived in Jerusalem and belonged to a group of Protestant German settlers coming mostly from Westphalia. Among them were also Maria Katharina's brothers Friedrich Wilhelm and Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck (1832–1913), the latter becoming in 1902 the grandfather of John Steinbeck. Cf. Ejal Jakob Eisler (איל יעקב איזלר), see Bibliography for details, footnote 203 on p. 50. . They lived in a house directly at the cemetery and improved their livelihood with cows and other livestock. Jerusalemites of all background took a fancy to their European style butter, and other dairy products they produced. So their house outside the city walls attracted visitors who bought and also immediately consumed at their kind of an inn.Ejal Jakob Eisler (איל יעקב איזלר), see Bibliography for details, p. 51. . After they quit their post Maria Katharina's brother Friedrich Wilhelm Großsteinbeck (1821–1858) succeeded them. However, Consul Finn prompted his dismissal after half a year in 1853.Ejal Jakob Eisler (איל יעקב איזלר), see Bibliography for details, footnote 220 on p. 56. . Tympanon of the lychgate to the cemetery. In 1853 Gobat separated a part of the cemetery, which had not yet been used for burials, and moved the Bishop Gobat School (Bischof-Gobat- Schule; est. 1847, erected between 1853 and 1856 on that site) thereto, taken over by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1877.Gottfried see Bibliography for details, p. 13. The actual burialground was then demarked by a new wall with a lychgate separating it from the school ground and garden. Therefore, the cemetery has no direct access to a street, but is reached passing the site of the school. However, in order to enlarge the burialground again, once a shortage of gravesites would occur, Gobat – on the occasion of separating the school ground from the cemetery – recorded a pursuant clause protocolled by the British consulate.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 8. Consul-General (1815–1882) aimed at dissolving the Anglican-Protestant ecumenical cemeterial community, however, the German Foreign Office and Bishop Gobat opposed him, the latter even threatening to resign if this cemeterial separation would lead to finally cancel the joint bishopric.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 6seq. Gobat assured that he did not and was not intended to consecrate the cemetery following Anglican rite, on which grounds non-Anglicans could be excluded from being buried. Furthermore, a bill had been entered to Westminster parliament to generally open Anglican consecrated cemeteries for believers of other Protestant denominations. Grave of Carl Christian Olsen (1815-1892), formerly pastor at the Nore Stave Church, Norway Alten's successor (1835–1909) instigated Gobat to execute a formal deed of foundation of the cemetery, issued on 18 September 1874, dedicating Mount Zion Cemetery for the burials of Anglicans and congregants of the Protestant churches of Augsburg (Lutheran), Helvetic (Reformed) and Utrecht Union (old Catholic) Confession.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 4. Thus Münchhausen considered Alten's concerns and objections against the joint cemetery to be obsolete and ended any attempt to dissolve the cemeterial ecumenical community. Furthermore, the deed states that the site had been bought using monies of the bishop, while it claims that the British government funds were used to actually prepare the site as a cemetery (levelling and enclosure). This formulation obviously was meant to forestall claims, that the cemetery were to be exclusively owned by the Anglican diocese because its purchase were financed by British funds. In 1883, while negotiating the succession of the late Bishop Joseph Barclay, the Prussian Minister of Cult and Education, Gustav von Goßler (1838–1902), in charge of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces,In the 19th century the old-Prussian state church, comprising Prussia's pre-1866 territory (so-called Altpreußen (Old Prussia)), adapted its name several times to denominational or territorial changes. relaunched the cemeterial issue in order to institutionalise the cemeterial community. He proposed to either reach equal rights as to Mount Zion Cemetery for both sides or to legally divide the cemetery.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 15. Generally Goßler suggested to establish an easement on the site of the Bishop Gobat School as to free access to the cemetery. His proposals remained unrealised. With the dissolution of the contract on the joint bishopric in 1886 diplomatic notes were exchanged confirming the status quo ante of the cemetery with its prior ambiguities. So technically the cemetery continued to be used and administered by the now purely English Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem and the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation, represented by the pastor of Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language (ranked provost at Redeeemer Church since 1898).After the contract of bishopric had been dissolved in 1886 Britain repaid the Prussian share in its original endowment capital in 1889. Combining the repaid £21,500 (= ℳ 430,000) with the Jerusalem Alms Fund of £11,000 (= ℳ 220,000) and the Jerusalem Church Construction Fund of £26,500 (= ℳ 530,000; collected between 1869 and 1888) King William II of Prussia (also German Emperor) in his function as summus episcopus (supreme governor) of the old-Prussian united Protestant state church (cf. Supreme Governor of the Church of England), established the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation () on 22 June 1889. Its purpose was and is the maintenance of then existing and establishment of new Evangelical institutions in Jerusalem, especially congregations, church buildings, and schools. The Evangelical say in matters and usage of Mount Zion Cemetery was assigned to the new foundation. In 1890 the Bishop Gobat School intended to acquire the unused reserve land of the cemetery, retained by Gobat in 1853 for its extension.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 16. In order to compensate for this loss a tract of land adjacent to the area already used for burials was to be purchased. The Evangelical congregation was asked to contribute a third of the incurred cost. George Francis Popham Blyth, Anglican bishop of Jerusalem between 1887 and 1914, announced to consecrate the extended cemetery following the Anglican rite. This aroused again concerns of the Evangelical Protestants whether this would not exclude them from burying there, and put again the separation of the joint cemetery on the agenda. Carl Schlicht (1855–1930), then Evangelical pastor in Jerusalem, however, came out in favour of the continued cemeterial community and Blyth assured, an Anglican consecreation would not exclude non- Anglicans from being buried.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 17. On 13 October 1892 Blyth unilaterally donated most of the reserve land to the Bishop Gobat School, issuing a deed of donation, and added the remainder to the cemetery. He informed Pastor Schlicht about this act on the 21st of the same month and asked his consent. Schlicht presented the sake to the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation in Berlin and recommended to agree. Before a formal consent arrived in Jerusalem, Rev. Johannes Zeller (1830–1902), Gobat's son-in-law and leader of Bishop Gobat School, started construction works on the land. This fait accompli incited Schlicht to formally protest at Blyth, claiming condominial property for the Evangelical Protestants. So Blyth stopped the works, however, stating: \\"The German [Protestant] community will always be most welcome to the privileges of interment which they hitherto enjoyed: but I have no knowledge of 'the German protestants' being 'proprietors of the ground'. The Anglican Bishop is the sole Trustee.\\"Bishop Blyth in a letter of 30 November 1892 to Pastor Schlicht, here quoted after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 18. The addition in edged brackets not in the original. In consequence the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation offered its agreement to ceding reserve land to the Bishop Gobat School, however, asking if this could be compensated. So consul- general Paul von Tischendorf – mediated by Johannes Zeller – arranged the accord that the Church Missionary Society would pay a compensation, however, Bishop Blyth, who maintained an uneasy relationship with Zeller,While Gobat had resorted to proselytising among Christians of other, mostly Orthodox denominations, which the Ottoman government had legalised by a Ferman in 1850 issued under the pressure of the Protestant powers. Such proselytism had been criticised by proponents of the Anglican High Church fraction. Blyth wanted to maintain good relations with the Orthodox churches, and therefore preferred missioning Jews and Muslims, however, the latter were forbidden to convert and to be missioned by Ottoman law. Zeller, a son-in-law of Gobat, and the Church Missionary Society again were proponents of Gobat's line. Cf. Abdul Latif Tibawi, British Interest in Palestine 1800–1901: A Study of Religious and Educational Enterprise, London: Oxford University Press, 1961, pp. 237–255. opposed that, so the reserve land remained with the cemetery.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 20. After Pastor Paul Hoppe had succeeded Schlicht in 1895 Bishop Blyth unilaterally issued cemetery rules including a scale of charges and fees in order to finance the maintenance of the cemetery and pay a superintendent (inspector) for the burialground, with copies sent to Hoppe on 16 January 1896.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 21. This improvement was very welcome to the Evangelical congregation, since the cemetery had had no orderly revenues so far. Henri Baldensperger (1823–1896), employed at Bishop Gobat School, had volunteered as gravedigger. Blyth employed Eno G. Hensman as inspector to succeed Baldensperger and to guard the cemetery. So Hoppe expressed the agreement of the Evangelical congregation but remarked that cemetery rules applying for both congregations should be decided upon by both of them. In the centre of Mount Zion: Bishop Gobat School (left) and Mount Zion Cemetery (centre right), view in 1903. On 24 October 1902 Blyth informed that with only 30 remaining empty cemetery plots it would be time for both congregations to search for new cemeteries, separate ones for each congregation. The Evangelical congregation answered, referring to the still existing reserve land, there would be no need for action.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 29. So in 1903 the Church Missionary Society again announced its interest in the reserve land, adjacent to Bishop Gobat School, and offered to acquire in return for the reserve land an even bigger tract of land, southerly adjacent to the existing cemetery. Hoppe, since 1898 elevated to the rank of provost, agreed and so on 25 January 1904 Blyth convened the two consuls, John Dickson (1847–1906) and Edmund Schmidt (1855–1916), both later buried in the cemetery, two representatives of the CMS, a pastor of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Among the Jews (LJS), and Hoppe.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 30. When Provost Wilhelm Bussmann, who had succeeded Hoppe in 1904, took the latter's seat in the ongoing negotiations, he proposed to legally divide the cemetery extension among the two congregations. This was opposed by Blyth, who offered in return an institutionalised joint administration and usufruct for both congregations. This would clear the long disputed relation of the Evangelical congregation to the cemetery and was thus most acceptable to them.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 31. Since the extension, which the CMS was to buy, measured a four times bigger area than the reserve land to be ceded, the parties agreed upon contributing to the purchase price. On 4 June 1904 Blyth, Rev. Brown (Christ Church, Jerusalem), Bussmann, Dickson, Schmidt and H. Sykes (CMS) signed the protocol determining the purchase, obliging the British and German governments to provide each for a quarter of the price amounting altogether to 1,440 Napoléons d’or (= 28,800 Francs of the Latin Monetary Union, or = £1,152). The CMS would defray the other half of the price. The Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation and William II, German Emperor, subscribed each for 180 Napoléons d’or, thus covering the German share. The cession of the reserve land had been negotiated by a bipartite mixed body. So in November 1905 Bussmann proposed to institutionalise the administration and financing of the burialground by a statute of Mount Zion Cemetery, which met consensual agreement, so that the mixed body executed the statute on 25 November 1905. The statute () established the burial board (; for its composition see board of cemetery), equally representing both sides.Cf. Article 1 (statute), here after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 33. Both parties could freely bury the deceased. In 1906 the Syrian Orphanage in Jerusalem contributed with 75 Napoléons d'or to the purchase, while Bertha von Braun, the widow of Friedrich von Braun (1850–1904), who after his sudden death had been buried on the cemetery on 31 May 1904, donated another 100 Napoléons d’or, while the Anglican side was still behind with its payments.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 34. In 1907 Bertha von Braun donated another ℳ 5,000 (= 6,250 Francs; = £250) for the purposes of the cemetery. Eventual deficits were to be halved among the parties, and it turned out that the stipulated burial fees did not cover the running expenses for inspector and maintenance.Cf. Article 3 (statute), here after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 33. Because deficits repeated the burial board decided to collect once a year alms in favour of the cemetery in both congregations, starting on Sunday 24 November 1912, and then annually on the 25th Sunday after Trinity Sunday. =During the World Wars and the British mandate= Memorial listing the names of the Jerusalemites of all faiths killed in WWI fighting in the German or Austro-Hungarian forces. Between 1914 and 1917, during World War I, the Sublime Porte expelled Britons as enemy aliens from the Ottoman Empire, thus leaving the joint administration of Mount Zion Cemetery to the Evangelical Protestants of German nationality. Until January 1917 the German Imperial Army laid out a section of the cemetery as a non-denominational war cemetery for Austro-Hungarian (5), British (2) and German soldiers (11) of all religious denominations killed in action in the battles close to Jerusalem since 1916 and retrieved by the German medical corps.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 35. After the British capture of Jerusalem on 9 December 1917 the British army also buried its soldiers on Mount Zion Cemetery, before the separate Jerusalem War Cemetery was inaugurated on Mount Scopus in February 1918.\\"Jerusalem Protestant Cemetery\\", on: Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) (homepage) A total of 104 British soldiers were buried here, of which 100 were later reburied at the War Cemetery, CWGC Cemetery Report, Jerusalem War Cemetery. although four who died between the Armistice of November 1918 and the end of Commonwealth War Graves Commission registration in August 1921 remained maintained there. On 26 July 1921 Bishop Rennie MacInnes had convened the burial board and only two Evangelical representatives could take part, due to their flight or the expulsion of many German citizens from the Holy Land by the British Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA). Gustaf Dalman, director of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology and representing the expelled Provost Friedrich Jeremias (1868–1945), presented the annual financial statements for the years of 1914 to 1917, when Britons could not participate in the joint board.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 36. The CMS was partially still in arrears with its half of the purchase price and the burial board had debts with Deutsche Palästina-Bank, which was in the process of liquidation after the expropriation of German property abroad for war reparations to the World War I allies (except the Russian Empire's successor the Soviet Union). Dalman's successor Provost Albrecht Alt participated in the board's continued settlement of the cemetery debts. In order to settle them Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language stepped in, which netted its holdings of similar amount with the afore-mentioned bank with the cemetery's debts, thus defraying its share in the debt amortisation. The prior military conflict and the German defeat did not impair the joint administration of the cemetery.Gustaf Dalman in a letter of 30 July 1921 to the board of trustees of the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation in Berlin, here after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 36 To the opposite, as Alt's successor Hans Wilhelm Hertzberg described, the Anglican clergy and missionaries socialised with their Evangelical counterparts in an overly friendly way.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 37. In 1924 all the German seats in the burial board were staffed again. In the annual report season 1925/26 Provost Hertzberg initiated that the burial board bought a hearse. Due to the altered political situation in Palestine with the League of Nations mandate for Britain the two parties revised the cemetery statute in 1929, replacing the British consul by the Deputy Jerusalem District Commissioner, further increasing the burial fees and introducing limited tenures on grave sites, in order to forestall a run out of space for new burials in the future.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 38. In 1932 Provost Ernst Rhein (1885–1969) estimated that with the then number of annual burials the cemetery would reach its maximal capacity in 1939. So the burial board started planning for a new cemetery. Grave of William Ewing (1857–1932), Scottish military chaplain and author The mandate government addressed the burial board with the request, to allow them also burying members of government authorities and armed forces, who had not been Anglicans or Evangelical Protestants. The growing number of British casualties killed in service for the mandate government by anti-British terrorists became a rising problem for the government.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 39. The congregation of Presbyterian Church of Scotland indicated its interest to join the cemeterial community. In 1933 Weston Henry Stewart, Archdeacon for Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan between 1926 and 1943, suggested to acquire land together with the mandate government for a new municipal cemetery on Mount Scopus next to the British Jerusalem War Cemetery, allowing each different congregation to use a specific section for its burials. If the mandate government was not to be gained for this project, the burial board should establish there a new Protestant cemetery, offering also the Scottish Presbyterians to join the burial board.Ernst Rhein in a letter of 23 May 1933 to the board of trustees of the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation, here after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 38 et seq. Due to the shortage of space the Evangelical board members asked to deny the mandate government its request to bury also non-members of the two congregations on Mount Zion cemetery, and welcomed a new Protestant cemetery including the Presbyterians. The Evangelical board members proposed that each congregation should contribute to the purchase price of approximately Palestine-£ 4,500 (at par with the British £) according to its expected share in the overall burials. This objection was most probably advanced because of their shortage of locally achievable funds combined with the Nazi dictatorship in Germany only very reluctantly allowing German missions to buy foreign exchange for mostly inconvertible reichsmarks (ℛℳ). Montefiore Windmill against the background of Mount Zion with Bishop Gobat School and Cemetery with its extension of 1904 (indicated by the bright protruding wall, upper centre right; photo of 1 May 1948) The Evangelical Protestants wanted to keep their equal representation on the burial board, unless the Presbyterians would join, and furthermore also the Arabic Anglican and Lutheran congregations, so that a quinquepartite board would become necessary. The burial board planned to register as legal entity in order to get the cemetery assigned as property of that entity. The new law established under British mandate provided for legal entities as proprietors of real estate. However, until 1936 the purchase of a new cemetery did not progress. The Evangelical congregation of German language feared to lose its equal say and therefore proposed to form two burial boards, one like the then existing bipartite for Mount Zion Cemetery and one quinquipartite for the new Protestant cemetery. The Anglican representatives, however, preferred a single quinquipartite board, now called board of cemetery, for both cemeteries.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 41 et seq. On 20 January 1938 Archdeacon Stewart assured Provost Rhein that the Anglican and Evangelical rights in Mount Zion Cemetery would remain untouched also under the board of cemetery enlarged by representatives of Scottish Presbyterians and Arab Protestants. In March 1938 the burial board negotiated with the Greek Orthodox patriarchate on the purchase of a tract of land near the Mar Elias Monastery. Since Germany started the Second World War in 1939 the Anglicans had to maintain the cemetery alone, because the Evangelical seats on the board remained vacant, since most of the Christian Germans were interned in Bethlehem in Galilee, Waldheim and Wilhelma as enemy aliens by the British mandate government by mid-1940. After the Second World War anti-British terrorism in Palestine strengthened again entailing the burials of the casualties also on Mount Zion Cemetery. There are Commonwealth war graves of 73 officers of the Palestine Police Force. =From the foundation of Israel until the Six-Day War= The 1947–1949 Palestine war brought about the partitioning of Jerusalem with Mount Zion Cemetery being located in the territory of Israel. The number of Evangelical Germans had severely shrunk due to emigration and relocation from Mandate Palestine in the years between 1939 and 1948. Also the number of Anglicans had sharply decreased with the withdrawal of the Britons until 1948. While the remaining Anglican Britons continued to live in Jordanian East Jerusalem and Israeli West Jerusalem, Evangelical Germans lived only in East Jerusalem after the last 50 Gentile Germans had been expelled from Israel until 1950, among them the last two deaconesses running Jerusalem's Unity of the Brethren lepers' hospital \\"Jesushilfe\\" (today's Hansen Lepers Hospital, Talbiya). Between 1948 and 1967, the Evangelical congregation buried most of its deceased on the Lutheran cemetery of the Bethlehem Arab Lutheran congregation. On 4 August 1953, the Royal Jordanian authorities registered the land bought at Mar Elias Monastery as property of the Society of the Jarmaleh Cemetery. East Jerusalem's Anglicans, Lutherans and Presbyterians then used Jarmaleh Cemetery. In March 1954 Provost Joachim Weigelt assumed office at Redeemer Church, Jerusalem, succeeding Johannes Doering, whose time in office included a British internment in Palestine between end of May 1940 and summer 1945.\\"Palestinian Lutheran Church Mourns Its First Bishop\\", in: Lutheran World Information (03/2007), p. 6 The board of cemetery convened again including Weigelt as representative of the Evangelical congregation. The board resumed its negotiations on a revision of the cemetery statutes as started in the 1930s. On 13 February 1962, the board of cemetery, with, among others, Archbishop Angus Campbell MacInnes and Provost Carl Malsch (1916–2001), decided the new Statutes of the Jarmale Cemetery Board. \\"The Board shall be responsible for the proper care and maintenance of the Jarmale Cemetery and of the British-German cemetery on Mount Zion.\\"Article 4 of the Statutes of the Jarmale Cemetery Board, here after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 44. The board of cemetery in its new composition held regular meetings until 1994, then again once in June 1998 and resumed regular meetings in September 2007.Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"2. Wurzeln\\". The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan (and the Holy Land) (name extension as of 2005), which had been established and royally recognised in 1959, was not represented on the board, since the new statutes based on a draft already prepared before 1959. Therefore, the Jarmaleh Cemetery Board formed a committee to discuss Malsch's proposal to accept the new church body in the joint administration of the cemetery. Canon Smith declared for the Anglican side their opposition to the admission of the Jordanian Lutheran Church. Malsch proposed to the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation to end the cemeterial condominium and to sell the inaccessible Mount Zion Cemetery, both of which the foundation clearly rejected in order to maintain the ecumenical cooperation and the long tradition of this burial ground.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 47. The new Provost Hansgeorg Köhler championed this opinion. So negotiations concentrated on the proposal to form two separate subcommittees for each of the cemeteries, with the option to include the Arab Lutherans in the administrations of Jarmaleh Cemetery. =From the Six-Day War until 2007= The discussion on a participation of the Arab Lutherans had not been concluded when the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War ended the division of Jerusalem. So with free access by all Jerusalem congregants the Commonwealth War Graves Commission took the effort to renovate and repair Mount Zion Cemetery in 1968.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 50. Since then the board of cemetery resumed burying on Mount Zion Cemetery. In 1977 the board of cemetery allowed Bargil Pixner of the Hagia Maria Sion Abbey to carry out archeological excavations on Mount Zion Protestant Cemetery searching for the Essene Gateway mentioned by Flavius Josephus.Pixner, Bargil. 1997, May/June. \\"Jerusalem's Essene Gateway: Where the Community Lived in Jesus' Time .\\" Biblical Archaeological Review 23 (3): 22–31. On 28 April 1981 the board assessed that Mount Zion Cemetery were in a good condition, the ongoing excavations, leaving the enclosing walls damaged, left their traces on the cemetery and exposed it to vandalism. In March 1983 the German embassy offered to contribute in an eventual renovation. In 1986 several newspapers published articles and letters to the editors expressing concerns because of the decay of the cemetery. In early 1986 Teddy Kollek uttered his worries and offered the aid of the City of Jerusalem for the preservation of the cemetery. In 1986 the board commissioned an Israeli architectural firm for its expertise on the state of the cemetery and in order to project a general overhaul. Although the Abbey finally repaired the enclosing wall, in March 1989 the board of cemetery prohibited Pixner any further excavations on its cemetery. The board started fundraising for a general renovation of the cemetery in order to thoroughly reconstruct the enclosing walls, to terrace slopes for gaining additional grave sites, and to repair the paths. Furthermore, all graves were to be refurbished and a viewing platform to be erected to develop the cemetery for tourists.Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"4. Die Friedhofsrestaurierung 1989 bis 1994 und das vorläufige Ende des Friedhofskomitees 1998 bis 2006\\". Graves on Mount Zion Cemetery, headstone for William Matthew Flinders Petrie (foreground) On 14 February 1989 the German embassy in Tel Aviv acknowledged the importance of Mount Zion Cemetery for the ecumenical history of British Anglican and German Evangelical ecclesiastical institutions, also accepting the necessity to finance the maintenance of the cemetery. The fundraising succeeded with £10,000 donated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, £5,758 (DM 19,000) by the German War Graves Commission, £4,242 (DM 14,000) by the German Foreign Office, £3,939 (DM 13,000) by the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation, £3,030 (DM 10,000) by the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), £5,393.90 (₪ 18,000) by the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, and £4,255.19 (₪ 14,200) by Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language.The alternative sums are calculated by conversion rates of December 1989. The commissioned Israeli architects started construction works in 1989. Already in the next year the board administrator asked them to stop all constructions, arguing the board's plans for the future of the cemetery were still unclear. In May 1993 the architects, whose contract had not been formally cancelled, noticed that another firm unilaterally commissioned by the Anglican side continued the constructions. So the originally commissioned architects took recourse against the board for breach of contract. Provost Karl-Heinz Ronecker, vice-chairman of the board, then negotiated a compensation of £1,943.67 ($3,000) for the architects, which the board confirmed on 26 August 1994. The constructions were continued by the new contractors for a while but never finished. Somewhat more than DM 17,000 of the EKD's share had been expended at that time. In 1992 and 1995 the official celebrations of the German embassy on Volkstrauertag (people’s mourning day) were held on Mount Zion Cemetery. In the following years youth groups from German Protestant congregations and of the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe helped maintaining graves and cemetery while staying in a holiday camp in Israel. With the discontinued constructions the enclosing walls had never been properly renovated. So between 1994 and 1998 the administrator of Mount Zion Cemetery appealed several times at Bishop Samir Kafity to convene the board in order to commission a reconstruction of the walls. The Anglican side refused arguing the maintenance of cemetery walls would be – according to the law – an obligation of the city of Jerusalem. The EKD then announced it would demand back the remainder of its contribution amounting to DM 5,700. So in 1998 Provost Ronecker unilaterally repaired the walls for $12,000 (£7,289.43). This made the Anglican bishop convene the board in June 1998, whose members developed a fray on how to share the cost. Ronecker proposed to divide the sum in four equal shares to be defrayed by the Anglicans, the Evangelical Protestants, the British government and the German federal government. The latter rejected any constribution, so the Evangelical congregation of Jerusalem shouldered $6,000. The German embassy, in 1989 so keen to maintain the cemetery, had changed its opinion completely claiming since to be not in charge. Soon later the Anglican administrator of the board of cemetery addressed the German embassy asking for a regular contribution to maintain the cemetery of $3,000, denied again. The Anglican administrator claims that the German government had committed themselves for regular contributions, an obligation neither documented with the embassy nor the Evangelical congregation. After 1998 any cooperation came to a halt. Without convening the board of cemetery the two congregations started to bury their deceased without informing the other side (three Evangelical burials one each in 1999, 2000 and 2001). In 2005 Bishop Riah Hanna Abu El-Assal told Protestant church representatives from Germany on their visit in Jerusalem that he is planning to convert Mount Zion Cemetery into a park. Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language was completely surprised by this unilateral approach. =New beginning since 2006–2007= With the new Provost Uwe Gräbe (as of 2006) and the new Bishop Suheil Salman Ibrahim Dawani the relations improved again. Representatives of EKD on their visit in Jerusalem emphatically submitted Dawani the necessity to convene the board of cemetery again. Mount Zion Cemetery, being the sole burial ground used by Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language, with that congregation growing, would need to return to an orderly administration as provided for by the statutes. So Dawani convened the board again on 12 October 2007. While interior quarrels somewhat jam the Anglican engagement for the cemetery, new projects demand the board of cemetery to take decisions. The Nature and Parks Authority signalised its wish to include the school garden of the Jerusalem University College, seated in the former Bishop Gobat School, into a public park along the walls of Jerusalem. In early 2007 members of the Diaspora Yeshiva, seated in the building of David's Tomb, usurped a site in the designated area for the city walls park outside of Mount Zion Cemetery. The Nature and Parks Authority announced to proceed against them but so far without any visible success. The members of Diaspora Yeshiva, illegally holding the new site, have no chance to get regular access to electricity and water supply. Therefore, in autumn 2007 they installed, without authorisation, a water pipe and electricity cable crossing graves on Mount Zion Cemetery connecting to their premise at David's tomb, as members of the board of cemetery had to realise at a cemetery inspection on 12 October of the same year.Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"5. Neubeginn seit 2006 – Perspektiven und neue Schwierigkeiten\\". The board then commissioned the legal advisor of the Anglican Church in Jerusalem to officially protest that intrusion. However, Diaspora Yeshiva did not remove its illegal installations. For several weeks water poured out of the improperly installed leaking pipe flooding part of the cemetery and thoroughly soaking the earth at the section of the graves of soldiers killed in World War I. On the weekend of 5 and 6 April 2008, the drenched ground imploded into a cavern below the cemetery forming a crater of 5 meter width and 5 meter depth. The cavern most likely forms a part of an excavation tunnel dug by the archaeologists Frederick Jones Bliss and Archibald Dickey in the 1890s. In the following days and weeks three graves precipitated completely or partially into the crater, a fourth grave is moderately endangered. Although Provost Gräbe and the Evangelical board administrator immediately alarmed all competent authorities the water was only turned off on 9 April.Cf. \\"ונדליזם בקברי חיילים גרמניים\\" [Vandalism to graves of German soldiers], in: Ma'ariv, 9 April 2008. Members of Diaspora Yeshiva did not remove their installations, but climbed again over the enclosing wall trying to repair the wrecked pipe. At the instigation of the representative for the non-Jewish religions in Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski personally promised the provost on 13 April, to take care of the issue. Several officials of the city administration tried to find a solution until August 2008. They finally reached the removal of the water pipe. The electricity cable, however, continues to cross the cemetery. Members of Diaspora Yeshiva continued repeatedly to enter the cemetery without any authorisation and thus managed to elevate the cable to three meters of height fixing it at trees on the cemetery. Throughout 2008 members of Diaspora Yeshiva continued to supply their illegal outpost on the site designated for the city walls park – crossing the cemetery – and the Nature and Parks Authority does not get them evicted from the plot. Jerusalem University College against the background of the trees on Mount Zion Cemetery (2009). On 6 August 2008 a representative of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the provost, the Evangelical administrator and the director of Jerusalem University College, who meanwhile has advanced to a guard of the cemetery, inspected the damages in the burial ground. The War Graves Commission consented to rescue the precipitated graves and to close the crater. However, the financing of this difficult operation was completely unclear. Diaspora Yeshiva, which is responsible for the damage, so far did not make up for it. The crater, the safety barriers, and the signs warning about the danger of collapse at the crater were symptoms of the desolate situation of Mount Zion Cemetery. The cemetery had fallen in decay again, with overgrown graves, dead dry and partially collapsed trees presenting a danger of fire. Criminals and drug addicts again and again climb over the walls and leave their traces, while dogs are straying around too. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission offered to fill the crater at its own expenses, however, without recovering the precipitated graves and their headstones, which would be a dangerous effort. The Evangelical congregation accepted and decided to commission new headstones. The War Graves Commission intended to fill the crater during November 2008. However, before that the archaeologist Yo'av Arbel (יואב ארבל), Israel Antiquities Authority, asked and was allowed to enter with a colleague through the insecure crater into the cavern underneath in order to explore the excavation tunnel presumably to be assigned to Bliss and Dickey.Arbel published a report on his exploration in Jerusalem. Gemeindebrief – Stiftungsjournal (04/2008), the printed version of the journal of Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language. Cf. Also Yo'av Arbel, C.V. . In the recent years the board of cemetery paid again some attention to its neglected Jarmaleh Cemetery. The enclosing fence of the Jarmaleh Cemetery has mostly collapsed. Almost all headstones there have been destroyed in wanton vandalism. The graves are overgrown and partially covered with rubbish. The last burial there dates back to 2003.Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"6. Noch einmal: \\"Begraben auf dem Zion“ – und der \\"Jarmaleh-Friedhof“…\\". Ownership and usage Under Ottoman law corporations could not own land, but only natural persons. As stated by the original deed in Arabic and French, issued on the occasion of the land acquisition in 1848, Mount Zion Cemetery was converted into an inalienable religious waqf endowment in favour of the Injiliyyun (; i.e. Protestants) as its beneficiaries, represented by their respective spiritual head () as mutevelli (, i.e. administrator, trustee).Samuel Gobat in a letter of 20 March 1872 to Georg Friedrich August von Alten, German consul-general in Jerusalem, here quoted after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 3, 10 and 13. A waqf may have beneficiaries, who take usufruct of it, but nobody may dispose of it as property. However, in 1853 Gobat separated a part of the cemetery, which had not yet been used for burials, in order to domicile the Bishop Gobat School (Bischof-Gobat-Schule; est. 1847) there, a clear contravention of the waqf deed, which demanded a use as cemetery. With the dissolution of the contract on the joint bishopric in 1886 diplomatic notes were exchanged confirming the status quo of the cemetery with its ambiguities. Paul von Hatzfeldt, German ambassador in London, stated \\"that the [Prussian] Royal Government takes it for granted that the use of the churchyard for its proper purpose by both Communities on equal footing as well as the equal right of the clergymen of each to perform the proper service shall continue until a possible agreement shall have been arrived at by the two Communities.\\"Paul von Hatzfeldt in a letter of 4 December 1886 to Stafford Northcote, here cited after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 16. And Foreign Secretary Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh replied: \\"The Archbishop [of Canterbury, Archibald Tait,] most readily concurs in the desire expressed in Count Hatzfeldt's letter as to the future harmonious cooperation of the Churches and the continued common use of the churchyard as hitherto.\\"Stafford Northcote in a letter of 8 January 1887 to Baron von Plessen, here cited after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 16. The addition in edged brackets not in the original. So technically the cemetery continued to be used and administered by the Anglican Bishopric of Jerusalem and the old-Prussian Evangelical Church, represented by the Evangelical pastor of Jerusalem (ranked provost since 1898). When Bishop Blyth unilaterally issued cemetery rules by end of 1895 Pastor Hoppe expressed the agreement of the Evangelical congregation but asked for future concerted decisions referring to the condominium of both congregations in Mount Zion Cemetery. Blyth then replied that the cemetery, \\"is not given either to the English or to the Germans by the Deed of Wakoof. What has always been given has not in any way been interfered with – the right of burying.\\"George Francis Popham Blyth in a letter of 16 April 1896 to Pastor Paul Hoppe, here cited after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 13. Furthermore, Gobat's \\"deed [of foundation of 1874] was illegal – it is not possible to alter a Deed of Wakoof after its completion.In this a waqf is similar to the legal construction of the Mortmain, or dead hand. … As sole trustee [mütevelli in Ottoman Turkish] of the Ground I cannot, in justice to my Trust, acknowledge the validity of this Deed, which is against the law of land …\\"George Francis Popham Blyth in a letter of 12 May 1896 to Pastor Paul Hoppe. Additions in edged brackets not in the original. Here cited after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 14. On 2 June 1896 Hoppe pointed out, that Blyth was not to be accepted as the mütevelli, because the waqf deed determined the chef spirituel of the Protestants as mütevelli, but after 1886 the Bishop of Jerusalem was not the spiritual head of all the Protestant waqf beneficiaries any more.The resumé of the waqf deed in French language says: \\"le dit évêque mandant … se constituant Mutevelli du dit Vakouf pendant sa vie et léguant ce droit à tout chef spirituel de la communauté protestante en question après lui.\\" Here quoted after Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 13. In his deed of foundation Gobat, again, had determined his Anglican episcopal successors to be the cemeterial responsible, however, Blyth rejecting that deed, still claimed the task as trustee being connoted with his office.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, pp. 23 et seq. On 12 May, the same year, Blyth had rejected Hoppe's demand for a bilateral accord, claiming the cemetery would be an Anglican cemetery, where an interference by Lutherans cannot be accepted.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 24. The dispute gained sharpness so that the two consuls intervened which made Blyth and Hoppe more conciliant again. Blyth and Hoppe adopted the point of view, that the waqf was no property in the sense of western law, with both congregations only being its beneficiaries.Gottfried Mehnert, see Bibliography for details, p. 25. Today's Israel land registry shows the Church Missionary Trust Association Ltd., London, as the proprietor of Mount Zion Cemetery. Jarmaleh Cemetery, in turn, is registered under the name of the Jarmaleh Cemetery Board, which, however, is not registered as a legal entity so that a government dispossession would legally be easily possible at any time. In May 1984 the Evangelical members of the board of cemetery formally objected by their lawyer for Bishop Kafity had twice overlooked them when inviting for board meetings. The bishop then reconfirmed: \\"Mount Zion Cemetery […] is a shared responsibility among the Anglican Church, the Lutheran Church, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the West German War Graves Commission.\\"Bishop Kafity in a letter of 27 July 1984 to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, here quoted after Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"3. Eckpunkte der gemeinsamen Friedhofsverwaltung\\". The board of cemetery followed that statement: \\"It was affirmed that the Cemetery is an international Protestant cemetery concerning Britain, Germany and local Anglican churches.\\"Cf. minute of 29 March 1985, board of cemetery, here quoted after Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"3. Eckpunkte der gemeinsamen Friedhofsverwaltung\\". This was, however, not always aware to the Jerusalem University College, seated since 1967 in the Gobat School building, through the site of which is the only access to the lychgate. Several times newly appointed college directors exchanged the locks, barring entrance for the uninformed representatives of the congregations or only reluctantly allowing passage to Mount Zion Cemetery through the site of the college. So in 1995 the Anglican Church in Jerusalem readvised the college, that representatives of Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation have right of free access to the cemetery at any time. =The joint board of cemetery= When established in 1906 the burial board (renamed to board of cemetery in 1929) comprised the following persons: # Anglican bishop of Jerusalem as chairman # Evangelical provost at Redeemer Church, Jerusalem, as vice-chairman # British consul in Jerusalem # German consul in Jerusalem # pastor of the Anglican Christ Church, Jerusalem # missionary director of the Church Missionary Society in Jerusalem # director of the Syrian Orphanage, Jerusalem # director of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology of the Holy Land in Jerusalem Since 1962 the Jarmaleh Cemetery Board, responsible for the cemeteries on Mount Zion and in Beit Safafa (Jarmaleh cemetery), comprised the following members: # Anglican bishop of Jerusalem as chairman # Evangelical provost at Redeemer Church, Jerusalem, as vice-chairman # Anglican bishop in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria # one representative of the congregation of St. George's Collegiate Church (cathedral), Jerusalem # two representatives of the Arab Anglican congregation, Jerusalem # pastor of the Anglican Christ Church, Jerusalem # two representatives of the Evangelical congregation of German language, Jerusalem # two representatives of the Presbyterian congregation of Jerusalem, one being the pastor of St Andrew's Church, Jerusalem Later the composition of the renamed Mount Zion and Jarmaleh Cemetery Board changed, since 1988 it consists of: # Anglican bishop of Jerusalem as chairman # Evangelical provost at Redeemer Church, Jerusalem, as vice-chairman # British consul-general in Jerusalem # Cultural attaché of the German embassy in Tel Aviv-Yafo # dean of the Anglican St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem # pastor of the Anglican Christ Church, Jerusalem # Jerusalem representative of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission # treasurer of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem # administrator of the Evangelical Jerusalem's Foundation # administrator of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem (since January 1989, unclear if without or with a vote) The accession of the pastor of Ascension Church at Auguste Victoria Foundation and of a pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland was under discussion but never decided. Between 1981 and 1985 the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan had a seat without a vote in the board, and its successor the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land is currently trying to regain a seat. Graves and burials Headstone on the graves of Conrad Schick and Friederike Dobler, with headstone on Bishop Michael Solomon Alexander's grave (background right). On Mount Zion Cemetery a number of Bishops of Jerusalem have been buried, such as Michael Solomon Alexander, Joseph Barclay, Samuel Gobat, and George Francis Graham Brown. There are a number of graves of educators, who built up educational institutions in the Holy Land, like Johann Ludwig Schneller (Syrian Orphanage, Jerusalem), the deaconesses Charlotte Pilz, Bertha Harz, and Najla Moussa Sayegh (Talitha Kumi Girls School, Jerusalem until 1948, now Beit Jala), scientists and artists, William Matthew Flinders Petrie (Egyptologist), Conrad Schick (architect), Gustav-Ernst Schultz (Prussian consul, Egyptologist), Anglican and Lutheran clergy, e.g. the first Arab Protestant pastor Bechara Canaan (father of Tawfiq Canaan), deaconesses running the Protestant German Hospital, Adalbert Einsler, doctor at Lepers Hospital Jesushilfe, and many other parishioners of the Anglican and Lutheran congregations of Arabic, English, and German language. Furthermore, there are graves of British and German diplomats and officials, of officials and policepersons of the British Mandate government – among them victims of anti-British terrorism – and of their family members. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is taking care of 144 graves of Palestine Policemen, who died in service during the British Mandate. During the mandatory period the Anglican population in the Holy Land and the Jerusalem Anglican congregation had strongly grown. So between 1925 and 1932 the number of Anglican burials amounted to 75 (parishioners and other Anglicans), 42 of British and 28 of Arabic background, while 27 Evangelical Protestants had been buried, nine of whom were Germans and 12 Arabs. And last not least Austro-Hungarian, British, and German soldiers killed in action or else deceased in service in the Holy Land were laid to rest. The afore- mentioned two British and sixteen Central Powers' soldiers killed in action are buried in a special section in the centre of the cemetery. As another exception Templers bought grave plots for two deceased of their fellow faithful, before they opened a Templer cemetery of their own in Emeq Rephaim. Gravesites in the cemetery The burial fees – e.g., as fixed in July 1983 – are considerably lower for parishioners of the congregations holding the joint cemetery than for other faithful of the two respective denominations.Uwe Gräbe (c), see Bibliography for details, section \\"3. Eckpunkte der gemeinsamen Friedhofsverwaltung\\". Between 1982 and 1993 only four interments took place on Mount Zion Cemetery. The unauthorised burial carried out by members of the adjacent Jerusalem University College in 1989, unconsented with the board of cemetery or any of the enfranchised congregations, aroused their unrest. In a letter of 13 February 1989 to the college the Anglican diocese declared that the responsibility for all burials is with the Anglican bishop as well as with the Evangelical provost. In 1993 Mount Zion Cemetery comprised 80 empty grave plots, while an additional 50 were planned to be gained at terracing the slopes, which was never finished. After 1994 the Evangelical congregation of German language allowed several burials of Protestant non-parishioners. However, under Israeli law limited tenures on grave sites, as introduced in 1929, are not allowed any more, so that Mount Zion Cemetery will definitely reach its maximal capacity one day. The plan of empty grave plots is not always followed. In 2002 the grave of an Arab parishioner was erected crossing two graves of German soldiers. Burials continue until this very day and for Jerusalem's Evangelical congregation of German language Mount Zion Cemetery is the sole burial place.

The district includes much of the southwestern quadrant of the state and is anchored in Springfield. The district also includes Joplin and the popular tourist destination of Branson. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected to fill the district's vacant seat in the 2010 midterm elections following the successful election of Roy Blunt to the U.S. Senate.  Early life and education  A fourth-generation native of Missouri, Long was born in Springfield in 1955. He attended the University of Missouri and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity prior to dropping out. After taking time off from school for three years, Long decided to attend a nine-day training program at the Missouri Auction School in Kansas City. He received his Certified Auctioneer designation via the National Auctioneers Association.  Professional career  Long owned Billy Long Auctions, LLC. He was also a talk radio show host on the Springfield- based station KWTO. He is a member of the National Association of Realtors, National Auctioneers Association, the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association, and the Greater Springfield Board of Realtors. During a September 2018 House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on alleged anti-conservative bias on social media, far-right internet personality Laura Loomer interrupted the meeting. Long began a mock auction chant pretending he was selling Loomer's mobile phone until she was escorted out. The incident generated considerable laughter and applause from the audience. Long also participated in the World Poker Tour, participating in professional sanctioned games including the Southern Poker Championship at the Beau Rivage and the Bellagio Cup. In September 2018, in response to sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Long retweeted a post comparing attempted rape to a \\"kiss on the forehead\\" on Twitter.

Bullard Mult-Au-Matic, a vertical, multispindle automatic lathe, 1914., p. 276 ff. In metalworking and woodworking, an automatic lathe is a lathe with an automatically controlled cutting process. Automatic lathes were first developed in the 1870s and were mechanically controlled. From the advent of NC and CNC in the 1950s, the term automatic lathe has generally been used for only mechanically controlled lathes, although some manufacturers (e.g., DMG Mori and Tsugami) market Swiss-type CNC lathes as 'automatic'. CNC has not yet entirely displaced mechanically automated lathes, as although no longer in production, many mechanically automated lathes remain in service. General nomenclature The term \\"automatic lathe\\" is still often used in manufacturing in its earlier sense, referring to automated lathes of non-CNC types. The first automatic lathes were mechanically automated and controlled by cams or tracers and pantographs. Thus, before electronic automation via numerical control, the \\"automatic\\" in the term \\"automatic machine tool\\" always referred implicitly to mechanical automation. The earliest mechanically automated lathes were geometric lathes, including rose engine lathes. In industrial contexts during the Machine Age, the term \\"automatic lathe\\" referred to mechanical screw machines and chuckers. Since the maturation of CNC, the implicit dichotomy of \\"manual versus automatic\\" still exists, but because CNC is so ubiquitous, the term \\"automatic\\" has lost some of its distinguishing power. All CNC machine tools are automatic, but the usage in the machining industries does not routinely call them by that term. The term \\"automatic\\", when it is used at all, still often refers implicitly to cam-operated machines. Thus a 2-axis CNC lathe is not referred to as an \\"automatic lathe\\" even if fully automated. Small- to medium-sized cam-operated automatic lathes are usually called screw machines or automatic screw machines. These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are up to in diameter and in length. Screw machines almost invariably do bar work, meaning a length of bar stock passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, the entire length of bar stock is rotated with the spindle. When the part is done, it is 'parted' from the bar, the chuck in released, the bar fed forward, and the chuck closed again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind. Larger cam-operated automatic lathes are usually called automatic chucking lathes, automatic lathes, automatic chuckers, automatics, or chuckers. The 'chucker' part of the name comes from the workpieces being discrete blanks, held in a bin called a \\"magazine\\", and each one takes a turn at being chucked and machined. (This is analogous to the way that each round of ammunition in the magazine of a semi-automatic pistol gets its turn at being chambered.) The blanks are either individual forgings or castings, or they are pre-sawn pieces of billet. However, some members of this family of machine tools turn bar work or work on centers (e.g., the Fay automatic lathe). Regarding bar work of large diameter (for example, or more), it is merely an academic point whether it is called \\"screw machine work\\" or just \\"automatic work\\". Screw machine Brown & Sharpe Single Spindle screw machine. Model 2G Sq Base, four-slide machine. 1 cap or 1 Air Feed. Screw machines, being the class of automatic lathes for small- to medium-sized parts, are used in the high-volume manufacture of a vast variety of turned components. During the Swiss screw machining process, the workpiece is supported with a guide bushing, near the cutting tool. =Screw machine nomenclature= Speaking with reference to the normal definition of the term screw machine, all screw machines are fully automated, whether mechanically (via cams) or by CNC, which means that once they are set up and started, they continue running and producing parts with little human intervention. Mechanical automation came first, beginning in the 1870s; computerized control (via first NC and then CNC) came later, beginning in the 1950s. Brown & Sharpe No. 1 wire feed screw machine. B&S; persisted in calling manually operated turret lathes \\"screw machines\\" long after most machinists were reserving that term to refer specifically to cam-op automatics. The name screw machine is somewhat of a metonym, as screw machines can make parts other than screws or that are not threaded. However, the archetypal use for which screw machines were named was screw-making. The definition of the term screw machine has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws. That is, there would have been no established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term screw machine was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic screw machine was applied, and the term hand screw machine or manual screw machine was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic screw machines, and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term screw machine no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of screw machine remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models \\"screw machines\\", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called screw machines there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc. With the advent of NC, screw machines diverged into two classes, mechanical and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical screw machines and CNC screw machines. However, in shop-floor jargon, the term screw machine by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical screw machine, so the retronym mechanical screw machine is not consistently used. Automatic chucker An automatic chucking machine is similar to an automatic screw machine; both use spindles in production. The use of spindles, which are able to drill, bore and cut the workpiece, allows several functions simultaneously on both machines. A key difference between the machines is that the automatic chucker handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one main spindle). Well-known brands of such machines have included National-Acme, Hardinge, New Britain, New Britain-Gridley, Acme-Gridley, Davenport, Bullard Mult-Au-Matic (a vertical multispindle variant), and Thomas Ryder and Son. Automatic chuckers are a class of machine tool specialized to narrow industry niches, such as OEM part suppliers to the automotive industry. They are limited in their economic niches to high-volume production of large parts, which tends to occur only at relatively few companies (compared to smaller work that may be done by small businesses). The market for such machine tools does not generally include local job shops or tool and die shops. Cam-operated chuckers are fading into history faster than most other non-CNC machine tool classes. This is because the few companies that have them tend to be forced to continually adapt to the latest state of the art (today all CNC) to compete and survive. Cam-op chuckers may be more likely to be scrapped than other types of non-CNC machine tools. Unlike with \\"Grandpa's South Bend lathe\\" or \\"Dad's old Bridgeport knee mill\\", virtually no one can afford to keep and use them for sentimental reasons alone. As with most nondigital commercial typesetting machinery (such as Linotype machines). Choice of machines and control type Mechanical screw machines have been replaced to some extent by CNC lathes (turning centers) and CNC screw machines. However, they are still commonly in operation, and for high-volume production of turned components it is still often true that nothing is as cost-efficient as a mechanical screw machine. In the hierarchy of manufacturing machines, the screw machine sits at the top when large product volumes are needed. An engine lathe sits at the bottom, taking the least amount of time to set up but the most amount of skilled labor and time to actually produce a part. A turret lathe has traditionally been one step above an engine lathe, needing greater set-up time but being able to produce a higher volume of product and usually requiring a lower-skilled operator once the set-up process is complete. Screw machines may require an extensive set- up, but once they are running, a single operator can monitor the operation of several machines. The advent of the CNC lathe (or more properly, CNC turning center) has blurred these distinct levels of production to some extent. The CNC turning center most appropriately fits in the mid-range of production, replacing the turret lathe. However, it is often possible to produce a single component with a CNC turning center more quickly than can be done with an engine lathe. To some extent too, the CNC turning center has stepped into the region traditionally occupied by the (mechanical) screw machine. CNC screw machines do this to an even greater degree, but they are expensive. In some cases they are vital, yet in others a mechanical machine can match or beat overall performance and profitability. It is not unusual for cam-op automatic lathes to beat CNCs on cycle time. CNC offers many benefits, not least CAD/CAM integration, but the CNC itself usually does not give any inherent speed advantage within the context of an automatic lathe cycle in terms of speeds and feeds or tool-changing speed. There are many variables involved in answering the question of which is best for a particular part at a particular company. (Overhead is part of the calculation—not least because most cam-op machines are long since paid for, whereas a late-model CNC machine has hefty monthly payments). Businesses relying on cam-op machines are still competing even in today's CNC-filled environment; they just need to be vigilant and smart about keeping it that way. In the multispindle segment, some machine tool builders also build hybrid machines that are part CNC and part old-school control (some stations are CNC while others are cam-op or actuated with simple hydraulic cycles). This lets shops with certain mixes of work derive competitive advantage from the lower cost compared with all-CNC machines. The variety of machines that allow profitable production within certain niches reflects the variety of work that exists: some high-volume work remains the province of cam-op; full CNC with all the bells and whistles outcompetes on some flexible low-volume work; and hybrid machines may yield the lowest unit price on mixes in between. Design Close up view of a Brown & Sharpe Single Spindle screw machine. Notice the six station turret, the front and rear slides, and the two vertical slides. Also notice the black shaft just over the turret for use of swing stop. An automatic lathe may have a single spindle or multiple spindles. Each spindle contains a bar or blank of material that is being machined simultaneously. A common configuration is six spindles. The cage that holds these six bars of material indexes after each machining operation is complete. The indexing is reminiscent of a Gatling gun. Each station may have multiple tools that cut the material in sequence. The tools are usually arranged in several axes, such as turret (rotary indexing), horizontal slide (linear indexing), and vertical slide (linear indexing). The linear groups are called \\"gangs\\". The operation of all these tools is similar to that on a turret lathe. By way of example: a bar of material is fed forward through the spindle. The face of the bar is machined (facing operation). The outside of the bar is machined to shape (turning operation). The bar is drilled or bored, and finally, the part is cut off (parting operation). In a single-spindle machine, these four operations would most likely be performed sequentially, with four cross-slides each coming into position in turn to perform their operation. In a multi-spindle machine, each station corresponds to a stage in the production sequence through which each piece is then cycled, all operations occurring simultaneously, but on different pieces of work, in the manner of an assembly line. View of Lead Cam and Seconds Gear Box for a Brown & Sharpe screw machine, Sq-base 542 Series. Operations =Form tools= For the machining of complex shapes, it is common to use form tools. This contrasts with the cutting that is performed on an engine lathe where the cutting tool is usually a single-point tool. A form tool has the form or contour of the final part but in reverse, so it cuts the material leaving the desired component shape. This contrasts to a single-point tool, which cuts on one point at a time and the shape of the component is dictated by the motion of the tool rather than its shape. =Threading= Unlike on a lathe, single- point threading is rarely if ever performed; it is too time-consuming for the short cycle times that are typical of screw machines. A self-releasing die head can rapidly cut or roll-form threads on outside diameters. A non- releasing tap holder with a tap can quickly cut inside diameters but it requires single spindle machines to reverse into high speed in order for the tap to be removed from the work. Threading and tapping speed (low speed) is typically 1/5 the high speed. =Rotary broaching= Rotary broaching is another common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool are driven by the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a hexagonal socket in the end of a cap screw. History An early automatic screw machines built by Charles Vander Woerd for the American Watch Company Inside the enclosure of a CNC Swiss-style screw machine The history of automatic lathes in industrial contexts began with screw machines, and that history can only be truly understood within the context of screw making in general. Thus the discussion below begins with a simple overview of screw making in prior centuries, and how it evolved into 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century practice. Humans have been making screws since ancient times. For most of those centuries, screw making generally involved custom cutting of the threads of each screw by hand (via whittling or filing). Other ancient methods involved wrapping wire around a mandrel (such as a stick or metal rod) or carving a tree branch that had been spirally wrapped by a vine. Various machine elements that potentially lent themselves to screw making (such as the lathe, the leadscrew, the slide rest, gears, slide rests geared direct to spindles, and \\"change gear\\" gear trains) were developed over the centuries, with some of those elements being quite ancient. Various sparks of inventive power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance combined some of these elements into screw-making machines that presaged the industrial era to follow. For example, various medieval inventors whose names are lost to history clearly worked on the problem, as shown by Wolfegg Castle's Medieval Housebook (written circa 1475–1490),. and Leonardo da Vinci and Jacques Besson left us with drawings of screw-cutting machines from the 1500s; not all of these designs are known to have been built, but clearly similar machines were a reality during Besson's lifetime. However, it was not until 1760–1800. that these various elements were brought together successfully to create (in contemporaneous parallel) two new types of machine tool: the screw-cutting lathe (for low-volume, toolroom-style production of machine screws, with easy selection of various pitches) and the first high-volume-production, specialized, single-purpose machine tools for the production of screws, which were created to produce wood screws [meaning screws made of metal for use in wood] at high volume and low unit price. Screw-cutting lathes fed into the just-dawning evolution of modern machine shop practice, whereas the wood- screw-making machines fed into the just-dawning evolution of the modern hardware industry, that is, the concept of one factory supplying the needs of thousands of customers, who consumed screws in growing quantities for carpentry, cabinet making, and other trades, but did not make the hardware themselves (purchasing it instead from capital-intensive specialist makers for lower unit cost than they could achieve on their own). These two classes of machine tools simultaneously took the various classes of screws and moved them, for the first time, from the category of expensive, hand-made, seldom- used objects into the category of affordable, often-interchangeable commodity. (The interchangeability developed gradually, from intra-company to inter- company to national to international). Between 1800 and 1840, on the machine- screw side, it became common practice to build all of the relevant screw- cutting machine elements into engine lathes, so the term \\"screw-cutting lathe\\" ceased to stand in contradistinction to other metalworking lathe types as a \\"special\\" kind of lathe. Meanwhile, on the wood-screw side, hardware manufacturers had developed for their own in-house use the first fully automatic [mechanically automated] special-purpose machine tools for the making of screws.. The 1760–1840 development arc was a tremendous technological advance, but later advancements would make screws even cheaper and more prevalent yet again. These began in the 1840s with the adaptation of the engine lathe with a turret-head toolholder to create the turret lathe. This development greatly reduced the time, effort, and skill needed from the machine operator to produce each machine screw. Single-pointing was forgone in favor of die head cutting for such medium- and high-volume repetitive production. Then, in the 1870s, the turret lathe's part-cutting cycle (sequence of movements) was automated by being put under cam control, in a way very similar to how music boxes and player pianos can play a tune automatically. According to Rolt (1965),. the first person to develop such a machine was Christopher Miner Spencer, a New England inventor. Charles Vander Woerd may have contemporarily independently invented a machine similar to Spencer's. However, the wood-screw-making machines of the 1840s and 1850s [special-purpose factory production machine tools as opposed to small-machine- shop machine tools], such as those developed by Cullen Whipple of the New England Screw Company and Thomas J. Sloan of the American Screw Company, had anticipated the machines of Spencer and Vander Woerd in various ways, albeit approaching the problem of automated screw production from a different commercial angle. All of the above machine tools (i.e., screw-cutting lathes; suitably equipped engine lathes and bench lathes; turret lathes; turret-lathe- derived screw machines; and wood-screw-factory screw machines) were sometimes called \\"screw machines\\" during this era (logically enough, given that they were machines tailored to screw making). The nomenclatural evolution whereby the term \\"screw machine\\" is often used more narrowly than that is discussed above. Spencer patented his idea in 1873; but his patent failed to protect the cam drum, which Spencer called the 'brain wheel'. Therefore, many other people quickly took up the idea. Later important developers of fully automatic lathes included S. L. Worsley, who developed a single-spindle machine for Brown & Sharpe, Edwin C. Henn, Reinhold Hakewessel, and George O. Gridley, who developed multiple-spindle variants and who was involved with a succession of corporations (Acme, National, National-Acme, Windsor Machine Company, Acme- Gridley, New Britain-Gridley);.. Edward P. Bullard Jr, who led the development of the Bullard Mult-Au-Matic; F.C. Fay and Otto A. Schaum, who developed the Fay automatic lathe;. Ralph Flanders and his brother Ernest, who further refined the Fay lathe and developed the automatic screw thread grinder. Meanwhile, engineers in Switzerland were also developing new manually and automatically controlled lathes. The technological developments in America and Switzerland flowed rapidly into other industrialized countries (via routes such as machine tool exports; trade journal articles and advertisements; trade shows, from world's fairs to regional events; and the turnover and emigration of engineers, setup hands, and operators). There, local innovators also developed further tooling for the machines and built clone machine models. The development of numerical control was the next major leap in the history of automatic lathes—and it is also what changed the paradigm of what the \\"manual versus automatic\\" distinction meant. Beginning in the 1950s, NC lathes began to replace manual lathes and cam-op screw machines, although the displacement of the older technology by CNC has been a long, gradual arc that even today is not a total eclipse. By the 1980s, true CNC screw machines (as opposed to simpler CNC lathes), Swiss-style and non-Swiss, had begun to make serious inroads into the realm of cam-op screw machines. Similarly, CNC chuckers were developed, eventually evolving even into CNC rotary transfer machines. These machine tools are little known outside the automotive manufacturing sector.

He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2013. He played college football at Michigan. He was a walk-on who earned 2009 CollegeFootballNews.com Freshman All-America second team recognition and 2009 Sporting News Freshman All-Big Ten honors for the 2009 Wolverines while being the second-leading tackler on the team. Granted a scholarship by the 2010 team for his second year, he was the second-leading tackler in the Big Ten Conference and was selected as a 2010 All-Conference honorable mention. He was also a 2011 All-Big Ten honorable mention for the 2011 team. He served the 2012 team as captain and was also a 2012 All-Big Ten second team selection and a 2012 Academic All-Big Ten honoree. Background Kovacs, a Hungarian American, attended Clay High School, which is the rival high school of former Wolverine teammate Kevin Koger. In high school, he earned varsity letters in basketball as a sophomore and junior. He also earned All-City recognition in track and field three times (first team as a senior, second team as a junior and honorable mention as a sophomore) and was a four-year letterman. He qualified for the Ohio State championships in the 4x400 meter relay. He was a three-year letterman in football, where he earned All-Ohio academic honors and All-district honors as both a wide receiver and defensive back. He was not recruited by any Division I schools as a high school football player, but he was recruited by some Division II schools. Kovacs only had two campus visits: Division II Hillsdale and Toledo (a school 13 miles from his high school). By the time he completed his college applications, even Hillsdale had lost interest in him. His father placed a call to Michigan Director of Football Operations Brad Labadie after Jordan was wait listed and got him to agree to review a homemade highlight reel. As his graduation neared, Kovacs shook hands with Andy Boyd, a Toledo coach, on a preferred walk-on spot. That same afternoon in June 2008, Labadie called to confirm that Kovacs had been admitted from the wait list. The admission came without an athletic scholarship. Labadie encouraged Jordan to attend walk-on tryouts. College career =Redshirt (2008)= Kovacs in 2012 at Michigan Stadium.Kovacs initially passed the walk-on tryouts, but he had to pass the physical with Paul \\"Schmidty\\" Schmidt, who had been a trainer since Jordan's father Lou had played and been on the coaching staff at Michigan. He had had surgery to repair cartilage damage in high school, but that did not alleviate his problems. When Jordan responded yes to a question about whether he had had any surgeries in the prior 12 months, it triggered a line of questioning about his senior season meniscus surgery. He did not make the 2008 Wolverines due to a knee problem, but was advised to try out again after his knee healed. After discovering a torn meniscus, he had a second knee surgery, which was successful. He attended every game that season in his family's season ticket section. =Freshman (2009)= In 2009, he was one of the most highly regarded walk-ons in the nation, and emerged from a group of Michigan football players who referred to themselves as \\"The Walk-On Nation\\". His debut on September 5 against the Western Michigan was on special teams. The following week, he registered 31 plays against Notre Dame after starting safety Michael Williams suffered leg cramps. He made his first start on September 26 against Indiana. On October 3 of that season, he had 17 tackles against Michigan State in the annual Paul Bunyan Trophy. He posted ten tackles and made his first career interception on November 14 against Wisconsin. That season, he played free safety before being switched to strong safety. He started one game at free safety and seven at strong safety over the course of the season. He finished the season as the second leading tackler for the 2009 Wolverines. He earned 2009 CollegeFootballNews.com Freshman All-America second team recognition and 2009 Sporting News Freshman All-Big Ten honors. He was also a Rudy Award candidate. =Sophomore (2010)= Kovacs earned a scholarship at the beginning of the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season. In the second game of the season on September 11 against Notre Dame in the Michigan – Notre Dame football rivalry game, Kovacs recorded his first interception of the season and second of his career as part of a 10-tackle effort. On October 16 he recorded 2.5 tackles for a loss against Iowa. After eight games in the 2010 season he ranked second in the Big Ten Conference in tackles. On November 18, he was nominated for the Burlsworth Trophy, which was a newly created award for the most outstanding player to have begun his career as a walk on. On November 20, he posted his first career quarterback sack during a season-high twelve tackle performance against Wisconsin. With one week remaining on the conference schedule, the performance tied Kovacs for third-overall in the Big Ten, gave Kovacs a wide lead among Big Ten underclassman (8.64 vs. 7.55 per game over the next highest performer) and extended his lead among Big Ten defensive backs (8.64 vs 8.27). In the final game of the regular season on November 27 against Ohio State in the annual Michigan – Ohio State football rivalry game, Kovacs recorded his second interception of the season and third of his career as part of a 17-tackle effort. He collected a career-best 41 return yards following the interception. In The Game, Kovacs tied a career- high with 17 total tackles including a new career-high 9 solo tackles. Kovacs ended the 2010 Big Ten Conference football season ranked second in the conference to teammate Jonas Mouton in total tackles. However, he led the team in solo tackles. Following the Big Ten Conference season, he was selected as an honorable mention All-Conference selection by the media. =Junior (2011)= When Brady Hoke took over as Michigan head coach for the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Kovacs impressed him quickly. Kovacs was one of the first five players named as a starter for the 2011 team. In the September 3, 2011 season opener against Western Michigan at Michigan Stadium, Kovacs forced a fumble that was recovered and advanced for a touchdown. Although the game was ended by mutual agreement in the third quarter due to inclement weather, Kovacs recorded 10 tackles, including two sacks. He was named the Lott Trophy impact player of the week. At first, the stats for the game were considered official by the Big Ten Conference and the University of Michigan, but the NCAA has vacated the statistics for this game because three quarters were not completed. However, at the conclusion of the regular season, the NCAA reversed course and ruled that since the game is counting for win- loss record, the statistics will be counted by the NCAA. On September 10, against Notre Dame, during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, he talied an interception, and eight tackles. When it became evident that the defense had improved markedly from the prior season, he and fellow safety Thomas Gordon were credited as being the \\"leaders of the defense\\". On October 8, against Northwestern, Kovacs posted two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down. Kovacs suffered a knee injury that sidelined him for the October 29 game against Purdue. Kovacs had been one of twenty quarterfinalists for the Lott impact player of the year. Kovacs was named as one of 10 semifinalists for the 2011 Burlsworth Trophy on November 22. Following the 2011 Big Ten Conference football season, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention recognition from the media and was selected as the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award recipient for the Michigan program. Kovacs earned 2011 Fall Academic All-Big Ten recognition along with 10 teammates. In the January 3, 2012 Sugar Bowl 23–20 overtime victory against Virginia Tech, he led the team with 11 tackles. Kovacs finished among the conference leaders in several statistics: sacks/game (.33, 17th), tackles/game (6.2, 30th) and fumbles forced/game (.17, t-9th). =Senior (2012)= Kovacs was elected team captain. He was selected to the preseason watchlist for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (best defensive player). At a ceremony on November 10, Kovacs' jersey number was changed from 32 to the previously retired number 11 which was recirculated as a \\"Michigan Football Legend\\" jersey in honor of Francis (\\"Whitey), Albert and Alvin Wistert. He was interviewed as part of a 13-minute segment that appeared on the edition of November 18 of 60 Minutes about the business of college football. Kovacs was a second team All-Big Ten selection by the coaches and an honorable mention selection by the media. On November 27, he was named a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy. At the December 3 team banquet, Kovacs earned team MVP for the season. He earned Academic All-Big Ten recognition in 2012. Following the season, he participated in the February 2, 2013 Texas vs. the Nation All-Star Bowl. Professional career Kovacs with the Los Angeles Rams in 2016 =Miami Dolphins and Philadelphia Eagles= Kovacs signed an undrafted free agent contract with the Miami Dolphins following the 2013 NFL Draft. Kovacs was assigned to the Dolphins' practice squad to start the 2013 NFL season. Kovacs was promoted to the 53-man roster in week 5 of 2013. Kovacs had a tackle in his debut against the Baltimore Ravens on October 6. He was released at the end of training camp in 2014. He was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad on October 6. On November 4, he was signed off the Eagles practice squad by the Dolphins, and was placed on the active 53 man roster. He had seven tackles over the course of the season, including 5 in December 28 week 17 contest against the New York Jets. On October 18, 2015, Kovacs recorded his first sack against Zach Mettenberger of the Tennessee Titans. Towards the end of the season he was expected to be released by the Miami Dolphins with the expectation that he would be placed on the practice squad once he cleared waivers. =Kansas City Chiefs= Following the season 2015 season, he was signed to a futures contract by the Kansas City Chiefs. On May 10, 2016, he was released. =Los Angeles Rams= On August 5, 2016, Kovacs signed with the Los Angeles Rams. On September 3, 2016, he was waived by the Rams as part of final roster cuts. Coaching career In 2017, Kovacs joined the Michigan Wolverines staff in a role assisting the team's defensive and special teams coaches.

It merged with the Chartered Bank in 1969 to form Standard Chartered. History The bank was incorporated in London on 15 October 1862 as Standard Bank of British South Africa. It was formed by a group of South African businessmen led by John Paterson. The bank started operations in 1863 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and soon after opening it merged with several other banks including the Commercial Bank of Port Elizabeth, the Colesberg Bank, the British Kaffrarian Bank and the Fauresmith Bank. It was prominent in financing and development of the diamond fields of Kimberley in 1867. In reflection to the growth of its branch network and expansion outside British controlled regions, the bank dropped the word \\"British\\" from its title and adopted the name Standard Bank of South Africa Limited in 1881. When gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand, the bank expanded northwards and on 11 October 1886 the bank started doing business in a tent at Ferreira's Camp (later to be called Johannesburg), thus becoming the first bank to open a branch on the Witwatersrand gold fields. It opened a second Johannesburg branch on 1 November 1901 along Eloff Street. From the 1890s through the 1910s the bank opened offices across Africa, although some of them were unsustainable and subsequently had to be closed. In 1912 it opened a branch in New York City. In 1920 it bought out the African Banking Corporation.Terry, Carolyn. 1978. The Desert Bankers: The Story of the Standard Bank in South West Africa. Cape Town: W.J. Flesch & Partners. By the mid-1950s, Standard Bank had around 600 offices in Africa. In 1962, the bank was renamed Standard Bank Limited, and a subsidiary was registered in South Africa under the parent bank's previous name, Standard Bank of South Africa. In 1965, Standard Bank merged with the Bank of West Africa expanding its operations into Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Merger In 1969 the Standard Bank merged with Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the combined bank became known as Standard Chartered Bank. Subsequent use of name In South Africa the Standard Bank Investment Corporation (now Standard Bank Group) was established as the holding company of The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited. Standard Chartered sold its remaining 39% stake in Standard Bank Group in 1987, and the two banking groups are now under quite separate ownership. Today, the Standard Bank name is used by the South African group, which has expanded outside South Africa, including forming a subsidiary in the United Kingdom known as Standard Bank London.

These neurohormones, produced by neurosecretory cells, are normally secreted from nerve cells in the brain that then circulate into the blood. These neurohormones are similar to nonneural endocrine cells and glands in that they also regulate both endocrine and nonendocrine cells. Neurosecretion cells synthesize and package their product in vesicles and exocytose them at axon endings just as normal neurons do, but release their product farther from their target than normal neurons (which release their neurotransmitters short distances at synapses), typically releasing their neurohormones into the circulatory system to reach their distant targets. Discovery In 1928, Ernst Scharrer hypothesized that neurosecretory neurons in the hypothalamus of teleost fish, Phoxinus laevis, had secretory activity similar to that of endocrine gland cells. As more became known about neurosecretory cells, the difference between the actions of nerve communication and endocrine hormone release become less clear. Like the average neuron, these cells conduct electrical impulses along the axon but unlike these neurons, neurosecretion produces neurohormones that are released into the body’s circulation. Combining the properties of the nervous and endocrine, these cells have the capacity to affect nerves through chemical messengers. Neurosecretion is a broad area of study and must be further observed to be better understood. Insects Insects play a large role in what is known about neurosecretion. In simpler organisms neurosecretion mechanisms regulate the heart, the process of metamorphosis, and directly influences the development of the gonadal function. In more advanced organisms the gonadal function is manipulated by the intermediary endocrine processes. Axons from neurosecretory cells trace to corpora cardiaca and corpora allata and produce and secrete a brain hormone which insect physiologists suspect is bound to a large carrier protein. Although the function is unknown, there are a multitude of these cells found in the ventral ganglia of the nerve cord. Neurosecretory cells, found in clusters in the medial and lateral parts of the brain, control corpora allata activity by producing juvenile hormone during the larval or nymphal instars, the phase between periods of molting in insects. The production of this hormone inhibits the insect during the conversion to maturity and reactivating once the fully-grown adult is prepared for reproduction. The 3rd International Symposium on Neurosecretion at the University of Bristol discussed the intracellular structure of the neurosecretory cells and the migration path to the target organs or vascular fluid areas by neurosecretory granules. More is being discovered on the identification of granules in hormones and the linking of their development with the organism’s physiologic state.

As a doctor, he served in various medical positions primarily in New York City, although he spent four years in Dundee, Scotland. He was very interested in genealogical and historical research. His work, including The Stiles Family in America, Genealogies of the Connecticut Family and The History and Genealogies of Ancient Windsor, Connecticut, continue to be widely cited by researchers and remain in print more than 115 years later. Family life and education Henry Stiles' father Samuel was the son of American Revolutionary War soldier Asahel Stiles from East Windsor, Connecticut. Their ancestors included farmer John Stiles, one of the first settlers of Windsor, Connecticut in 1636. Henry Stiles was born in New York City and had three brothers, Arthur, William, and Samuel, and one sister, Charlotte. He attended the University of the City of New York beginning in 1848, one year after its founding. He transferred to Williams College in 1849 as a sophomore. His health took a turn for the worse, and he did not finish his degree there until 1876. In 1856 he married Sarah Woodward of Freeport, Illinois. They had two children, a daughter Elliot and a son Charles Butler. Henry Stiles returned to school at the University of the City of New York and the New York Ophthalmic Hospital, graduating from both in 1855. Professional life He practiced medicine for a few months in New York City before moving briefly to Galena, Ohio, where he took on a partner, Dr. Timothy M. Wilcox. In 1856 he moved again to Toledo, Ohio where he edited the Toledo Blade newspaper. In July 1856, he began practicing medicine in Brooklyn, New York, and in 1859-63 he expanded his practice to Woodbridge, New Jersey. In 1868-70 he served in the Brooklyn office of the Metropolitan Board of Health as a clerk in the Bureau of Vital Statistics. Two months later he was appointed Chief Clerk. In 1870-73 he was a medical inspector in the Board of Health of New York City. In 1872, he helped to organize the American Public Health Association in New York City, and founded and became an officer in the Society for Promoting the Welfare of the Insane, an organization that sought to protect the welfare of the mentally ill in New York City. He taught on the topics of hygiene and sanitary legislation in the New York homoeopathic medical college. On June 17, 1873, he was appointed as a Sanitary Inspector until the next month, when he was made Superintendent of the State Homeopathic Asylum for the Insane in Middletown, New York. He directed construction of its first two buildings. He received a master's degree from Williams College with 1876. In September, 1877, he resigned as Superintendent and from 1877 to 1881 managed a homeopathic hospital in Dundee, Scotland, remaining there until 1881. In 1881 he and his wife's health deteriorated, and they returned to New York. In January 1882 he established a private practice to treat individuals with mental and nervous diseases at Hill View, New York. He also taught the treatment of mental and nervous diseases in the New York Woman's Medical College and Hospital from 1882 till 1885. He practiced in New York until 1888, when he moved to Hill View on the shore of Lake George, New York. There he continued to treat mental and nervous diseases until 1901. He was a member or corresponding member of and served in various offices of the American Ethnological Association; Dorchester Historical and Antiquarian Society; New England Historic Genealogical Society; State Historical Society of Wisconsin; Arizona Historical Society; Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia; and the American Philological Society of New York. He was a life member of the Long Island Historical Society. Genealogical and historical activity In 1857-8 Stiles formed the company Calkins and Stiles which published a number of educational articles and journals, including the American Journal of Education. In May, 1863 Stiles was one of the founders of the Long Island Historical Society, and he became a director and its first librarian. In 1865 he was an active member of the Faust Club which published limited editions of Wood's History of Long Island, and of Farman's Notes on Brooklyn, N. Y. In 1865 he issued a limited edition of two volumes describing to the condition and experiences of prison ship captives in Wallabout Bay, under the title of The Wallabout Prisonship Series, and also edited The Genealogy of the Stranahan and Josslyn Families. In 1867 he issued the first volume of his History of the City of Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1869 the second, and in 1870 the third. He wrote a short biography, the Life of Abraham Lincoln (1865); 22 of the 56 biographies in The Men of Our Day (1868), one or two campaign biographies of General Ulysses S. Grant, and portions of many other subscription books. He contributed articles to many newspapers and magazines, and brief biographies of publishers in the Round Table for 1866-7; papers in the Historical Magazine, of which he was editor; letters and historical sketches in the Rahway Times, New Jersey, under the nom-de-plume of \\"Tip Top.\\" In 1884 he edited and largely contributed to the Illustrated History of the County of Kings and the City of Brooklyn, in two volumes, and in 1887 completed editing The Humphreys Family and Genealogy. He helped to organize the American Anthropological Society in 1869, and was one of the seven founders of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, serving as its president from 1869 until 1873. After his full retirement in 1901, he devoted all his time to completing and preparing for publication of The History of Ancient Wethersfield, Connecticut. Stiles was described upon his death as having \\"made it possible for thousands to trace their ancestry to the founders of our American Government and to honored names in the older governments of the world.\\" Stiles died on January 7, 1909.

Produced by Toei Animation, the series is directed by Munehisa Sakai, who directed the One Piece anime series. Character designs were by Akira Takahashi, who previously worked on Kaidan Restaurant. The series aired on TV Asahi's ANN network between February 6, 2011 and January 29, 2012, replacing HeartCatch PreCure! in its initial timeslot and was succeeded by Smile PreCure! A manga adaptation by Futago Kamikita was serialised in Kodansha's monthly Nakayoshi magazine. The topic of the series is music, which influences the names of the Cures and the magical devices they use.  Plot  In a place called Major Land, the \\"Melody of Happiness\\" is due to be played, spreading happiness throughout the world. However, an evil man named Mephisto steals the Legendary Score, plotting to turn it into the \\"Melody of Sorrow\\" to spread sadness across the land. Aphrodite, the queen of Major Land, scatters the Notes that make up the Legendary Score into the human world and sends a fairy named Hummy to Kanon Town in order to recover them. There, Hummy meets two girls, Hibiki Hojo and Kanade Minamino, who are chosen to become the Suite Pretty Cures in order to recover the missing Notes and protect everyone's happiness.  Characters  = Suite Pretty Cures = ; : Voiced by Ami Koshimizu : Hibiki is a 14-year-old in the second year of Private Aria Academy junior high. She has a bright personality, excels at sports and volunteers in sport clubs, but isn't very good at schoolwork. Although her parents are musical celebrities, Hibiki thinks she has no musical talent even though she has absolute pitch. She played piano as a kid, but stopped for when she felt she let her father down after a performance. She also loves to eat sweet things, particularly the cakes from Kanade's family's shop. : After meeting Siren, her potential as a Pretty Cure was awakened when she and Kanade were rendered immune to Siren's attack, and through her musical score, she transforms into Cure Melody. As Cure Melody, her normally brown- orange hair tints light pink and becomes tied in extra long twintails. Her theme colors are various shades of pink, and her Fairy Tone is Dory.

As Siren, she has powerful abilities and can create Negatones using her dark powers. She can also use the powers of her necklace to take the form of any person she wishes. In her normal human form, known as Ellen, she is a strong fighter and can materialize notes to use as projectiles. : During Episode 21, her potential of Pretty Cure was awakened as she wanted to protect Hummy, who is captured by the Minor Trio.

Unbeknownst to the Pretty Cures, she had masked herself as a mysterious fighter named Cure Muse who aids them using colorful piano keys to form barriers and restraints. She often assists the Pretty Cures if they are trapped, but leaves them to finish off the Negatones. She hides her status under the mask and does not speak, as her Fairy Tone partner, Dodory, does all the talking. She often declares that she will not partner herself with the Cures until the time is right. : During Episode 35, she reveals herself to be Major Land's princess, the daughter of Aphrodite and Mephisto. After her father goes missing, she runs away to Kanon Town and disguises herself, living with her grandfather, Otokichi.

She is sent into the human world to search for and collect the scattered notes of the Melody of Happiness until she meets both Kanade and Hibiki. She is able to use magic by clapping her hands, which she uses to purify Notes that were transformed into Negatones and subsequently defeated by the Pretty Cures. She is also able to use her magic to recover the Cure Modules if they are lost. Hummy is very friendly and close to her childhood friend, Siren. Even after Siren betrays her and her nation, she does not see her as a foe, which often causes trouble for the Cures. ; : Eight special jewel-like fairies that came from Major Land along with Hummy. These fairies give Pretty Cure special abilities and powers when used by inserting them into their Cure Modules and Cure Belltiers.

He comes and goes like a ghost in any music activity. During episode 36, it is revealed that Ototkichi is Aphrodite's father, and has kept watch over actions between Pretty Cures and enemies. He loves Ako, his granddaughter, very much and tends to gush with love when she is mentioned. He once fought against Noise and managed to seal him away in a fossil, and has since been working on the organ which can produce saintly notes should he awaken again. = Minor Land = ; : : The main antagonist of the series, Mephisto is a childish and melodramatic emperor of the nation \\"Minor Land\\". He attempts to make the \\"Melody of Happiness\\" into a \\"Melody of Sorrow\\" to make all worlds tragic and reflect his musical taste. Mephisto has the power to brainwash others into doing his bidding using headphones that sound the Noise of Evil, but later it turns out that Mephisto is a victim of the Noise of Evil himself, who was Aphrodite's husband, the prince consort of Major Land. After being ambushed and controlled by Noise when he goes to retrieve the Healing Chest in the cursed forest, he establishes Minor Land. In Episode 36, Ako manages to defeat the evil in his heart and return him back to normal. Like his father-in-law, Mephisto tends to gush about Ako. ; : The loyal servants of Mephisto. Although they live to serve Mephisto, they often squabble with each other over who gets to be the leader. In episode 26, Mephisto uses the hypnosis earplugs to increase their powers, as well as make more powerful Negatones. While the Trio the Minor came from Major Land and worked for the royalty, only Falsetto willingly allied himself to Noise while Bassdrum and Baritone were placed under the being's spell to serve him.

After Falsetto assumes leadership, he transforms Baritone into a fish-like monster. ; : : The Negatones are the series' monsters of the week. They are created when a scattered Note is exposed to the Melody of Sorrow, combining with a nearby item to form a monster that spreads the Melody of Sorrow, causing people to despair. When they are defeated by the Pretty Cures, they return to the original item while the Notes are purified by Hummy and stored inside one of the Fairy Tones. ; : : Noise is a powerful bird-like demon and the true main antagonist of the series, created from the sorrow of humanity. He is responsible for turning Mephisto evil, as his song can brainwash whoever hears it. Though Otokichi sealed Noise away inside a fossil, Falsetto has been trying to revive him by playing the Melody of Sorrow to draw energy from those who fall into sorrow listening to him. After Noise breaks free from the seal upon hearing an incomplete Melody of Sorrow, he assumes a chick-like form that Ako named , and used this form to get close to the Cures and steal their Notes. However, he was soon discovered to be Noise after he attempted to attack Otokichi. Once the Melody of Sorrows is completed, Noise's resurrection is completed as he resumes his attack on Major Land.

But the Cures manage to purify Noise, who they found in Kanon Town as a newborn chick born from the joy of humanity. = Minor characters = ; : : Hibiki's father, the music teacher of Private Aria Academy and consultant of Orchestra Club.

The company began in 1971. Amway Australia is a Multi-level Marketing firm. According to a report that studied the business models of 350 MLMs, published on the Federal Trade Commission's website, at least 99% of people who join MLM companies lose money. History Amway Australia opened in April 1971 and was Amway's first market outside of North America. The company launched quickly, registering more than 400 distributors in its first month of operation, however sales soon stagnated. Investigations revealed problems with quality control at local manufacturers and the decision was made to manufacture and ship products from Amway headquarters in the US. By 1993, wholesale sales had reached A$148 million.ref In that year Amway Australia became part of the publicly listed company, Amway Asia Pacific, and by 1998 sales had reached A$198 million, with more than 100,000 distributors marketing over 2,500 products. In 2000 Amway Asia Pacific returned to private ownership by New AAP Limited, a Bermuda corporation.Sec Info - New AAP In March 1998, Amway Australia launched its first internet based ordering system (ELVIS - Electronic Link Via Internet Services), and processed $15.9 million in sales in July 1998. In April 2000 ELVIS was replaced by a2k and Amway Australia became one of the first Amway affiliates to introduce a new business model, dubbed IMC (where the \\"I\\" stands for Independent Business Owner [IBO], the \\"M\\" stands for a new Member classification, and \\"C\\" stands for Client). Along with Amway products, the new portal provided access to various partner company products, including IBM, Petals, RM Williams, Blue Star Office Supplies, and AFS Financial services. In 2000 it was reported that Amway was the largest direct selling company in the Australian region with annual turnover of more than $170 million and a network of 100,000 home-based distributors. Thirty percent of products sold by Amway Australia come from Australian suppliers, with the rest from Amway factories in the US, Europe, and Asia. By 2010, 40% of people joining Amway Australia were under the age of 30 and the company had embraced social media such as Facebook and Twitter as part of their sales and communications processes, as well as increasing brand marketing efforts through the signing of endorsement deals with swimmer Libby Trickett and Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist as \\"Ambassadors\\". Local operations Amway Australia has six business centres opened in Loganholme (Qld), Bella Vista (NSW), Chatswood (NSW), Box Hill (Vic), Perth (WA) and Adelaide (SA). Controversy The \\"direct selling\\" company has been dogged by allegations of being an illegal pyramid scheme for decades. The president of Amway has stated to Australian media that \\"this is old news\\". In 1994, NSW state parliamentarian Mr Scully questioned the Consumer Affairs minister whether Amway Australia's distribution practices used dishonest, unethical and inappropriate behaviour. The Minister for Consumer Affairs replied that \\"Complaints against Amway or Amway distributors are very few and indicate little cause for concern\\". Following a complaint from Amway, the department had prosecuted one Amway distributor for misleading conduct involving the potential recruitment of Amway distributors into another work-at-home scheme. Amway Australia Distribution Practices In 2003, the Australian Tax Office challenged deductions made by Amway Australia over an 8-year period for seminar expenses in resort locations, offered as incentives to successful distributors. Amway had a partial win with the Federal Court ruling Amway was largely entitled to the deductions, however it was ruled that substantial food and drink bills associated with the seminars were not deductible. In 2004, this ruling was overturned and the deductions were allowed in full because it was a serious business occasion.

It usually refers to a runner on third base breaking for home (but occasionally refers to a runner at second base breaking for third). Similar to the safety-squeeze play, the runner at third breaks for home as soon as he sees that the batted ball is on a downward plane for a ground ball. If there is a runner at second base, he will also break for third if the batted ball is on the first base side of second. The play can backfire if the ball is hit directly at the third baseman or the pitcher as a putout will naturally be made at home plate to prevent the run from scoring. In this situation, the baserunner may freeze and return to third. At this point the runner at third's objective changes from scoring to getting in a rundown in order to provide an opportunity for the batter to end up at second base. The main advantage to breaking for home on contact is that it reduces the amount of time an infielder will have to make a play at home and, thus, increases the likelihood of the runner scoring. A secondary advantage is that the possibility of a contact play will often cause the defensive infielders to \\"play in,\\" meaning closer to home plate, giving them less time to react to a hit ball and a greater likelihood of not being able to field it cleanly. The contact play is normally used when there is one out. With no outs, it is generally considered best not to risk being thrown out at home, since there will still be two more opportunities for later batters to drive in the runner. The only exception is when there is also a runner at first, since any ball fielded quickly enough to throw out the runner trying to score is also likely to be an easy double play ball, and the team has a much higher run expectation that inning if the result of the play is an out at home and runners on first and second than if the result is two outs and a runner at third. With two outs, all runners on base automatically break on contact, since there is no point in staying at their base while the fielder gets the final out of the inning by throwing to first base. Most students of Sabermetrics believe the contact play is proper strategy whenever there is a man on third and one out, since the loss from failure is tiny. Using standard tables of run expectation based on the number of outs and runners on base (such as Sabremetrics 101: Run Expectancy Matrix, 1999–2002), the difference between having a runner on third with two outs (the usual result of not using the contact play on a typical ground ball out) and having a runner on second with two outs (the usual result of using the contact play and having the breaking runner caught in a rundown) is only 0.043 runs. When the contact play scores a runner who otherwise would still be at third while an out is recorded at first, the net gain is 0.730. Put another way, even if the contact play failed 16 times for every one time it succeeded, it would improve a team's run scoring overall. Even that understates the advantage, since the need for the defense to play in often results in both the runner scoring and the batter reaching base safely, in which case the net benefit is 1.186 runs, which means that it could fail 27 times as often as it helped and still benefit the team overall.

His power was increased soon afterwards when the Nazis dissolved the Hamburg Parliament and awarded Krogmann power of decree.Bajohr, \\"Aryanisation\\" in Hamburg, p. 47 His appointment was ratified in no small degree because of his status as a member of one of Hamburg's pre-eminent mercantile families and as such it was hoped that he would appeal to the business community in the city, much of which was sceptical about the Nazis.John Garrard, Heads of the Local State: Mayors, Provosts and Burgomasters since 1800, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, p. 143 However Krogmann had an early rival however in the form of Reichstatthalter (Governor) Karl Kaufmann and by 1936 he had been named Führer of Hamburg, denting Krogmann's power.Bajohr, \\"Aryanisation\\" in Hamburg, pp. 47-48 Initially mayor, he had been given the stronger title Regierender Bürgermeister following the dissolution of the Hamburg Parliament. However, as Kaufmann's power grew so Krogmann's status diminished so as by 1937 he had been demoted to the lesser title of First Councillor of the Municipal Authority. Despite his shaky status Krogmann, a devotee of the writings of Richard Wagner, Paul de Lagarde and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, was a staunch believer in Nazism, especially its antisemitic aspects and rigorously enforced anti-Jewish laws within Hamburg whilst publicly speaking in support of them elsewhere. He demonstrated this in particular in a speech he delivered to the Ostasiatischer Verein in 1935 in which he rounded on members of the business community who were critical of the racial policy of the Third Reich, whilst emphasising the \\"decisive importance\\" of the Jewish question.Bajohr, \\"Aryanisation\\" in Hamburg, p. 55 Post-war After the Second World War he was interned in Bielefeld until being fined 10,000 Marks in August 1948 for membership of a criminal organisation and released.Dr. Heinrich Erdmann, Hamburg im Dritten Reich.

Membership  = Phases of admission = Members of the movement are formally admitted in three phases: ;1. The Promise In the presence of a priest, each prospective member makes a promise to God and the person's guardian angel to love the angel and respond to the angel's instructions given through the person's conscience. Then, during this preliminary year, the future member endeavours to listen to the angel's voice. ;2. Consecration to one's angel guardian In a candle-lit ceremony before the Blessed Sacrament members consecrate themselves to their individual guardian angels, undertaking to become like angels and to venerate them and asking their guardian angels to obtain for them a strong love that will inflame them. Membership begins with acceptance of this consecration by a priest in the name of the Church. ;3.

Other associations followed, including a priestly sodality and in the following two decades the movement spread to many places in the world.Opera dei Santi Angeli: La nostra storia = Controversy = In her many writings, Mrs Bitterlich also proposed some novel theories about the functions, groupings and personal names of angels and demons and about an on-going \\"spiritual warfare\\" between the two. These theories and the practices based on them gave rise to controversy and on 1 December 1977 Cardinal Joseph Höffner, Archbishop of Cologne, brought them to the attention of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which began to study them shortly after Mrs Bitterlich's death in the following year.Holdren, Alan. \\"Controversial angels' order given Vatican OK\\", Catholic News Agency, 5 November 2010 The Congregation carried out the requested investigation and responded on 24 September 1983 with a letter, known by its incipit, Litteris diei, which laid down: #In fostering devotion to the Holy Angels, Opus Angelorum must respect the teaching of the Church and of the Holy Fathers and Doctors. In particular, it is not to spread a form of devotion to the Angels using the \\"names\\" derived from the alleged private revelation attributed to Mrs Gabriele Bitterlich, nor may it use those names in any prayers of the community. #Opus Angelorum is not to demand or even propose to its members what is called the Promise of Secrecy, although with regard to the internal affairs of the Opus Angelorum, it is lawful to maintain the discretion that befits members of the Church's institutes. # The Opus Angelorum and its members will strictly observe the norms of the liturgy, especially regarding the Eucharist. This holds in particular for the so-called \\"Communion of expiation\\". This was followed by a decree of 6 June 1992, which repeated the contents of the 1983 letter and, in view of incorrect interpretation and application of that letter, laid down the following rules: #The theories originating from the alleged revelations of Mrs Gabriele Bitterlich concerning the world of the angels and their personal names, groupings and functions cannot be taught or in any way, whether explicitly or implicitly, be used in the organization and structure of the Opus Angelorum, such as its worship, prayers, spiritual formation, public or private spirituality, ministry and apostolate. The same rule holds for any other Church-approved institute or association. #The various forms of acts of consecration to the angels used in the Opus Angelorum are prohibited. # Also prohibited are the so-called distance administration of the sacraments and the insertion into the Eucharistic liturgy and the Liturgy of the Hours of texts, prayers and rites directly or indirectly related to the aforesaid theories. #Exorcisms may be carried out only in line with the Church's norms and discipline on the matter, and with the use of formulas approved by the Church. #A Delegate with special faculties, appointed by the Holy See, will in contact with the bishops oversee and promote the application of these norms. He will also clarify and determine the relations between the Opus Angelorum and the Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross.Decree Litteris diei of 6 June 1992 on the Teaching and Particular Usages of the Opus Angelorum Association = Approval = The Delegate chosen was the Dominican priest, Father Benoît Duroux, who in March 2010 handed over to another Dominican priest, Father Daniel Ols. On 31 May 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith approved a revised form of the movement's Act of Consecration to the Angels. In 2002, the female institute of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, associated with but independent of the Canons Regular, was established in Innsbruck. In the following year, 2003, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life granted definitive approval to the Order of Canons Regular of the Holy Cross, a religious institute founded in 1131 and suppressed in 1834, which was refounded in 1977 and received the initial (provisional) formal approval (decretum laudis) of the Holy See in 1979.History of the Order of the Holy CrossOrder of Canons Regular of the Holy Cross (O.R.C.) To it, in accordance with canons 677 §2 and 303 of the Code of Canon Law, the care of Opus Angelorum movement is committed. On 7 November 2008, the same Congregation approved the statutes of Opus Angelorum as a public association of the faithful. On 4 November 2010, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared: \\"Today, thanks to the obedience of its members, the Opus Angelorum can be considered to be living loyally and serenely in conformity with the doctrine of the Church and with canonical and liturgical law. Therefore, in its present state, the Opus Angelorum is a public association of the Church in conformity with traditional doctrine and with the directives of the Holy See.\\" = Opposition = The tabloid German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau published a disapproving article by Jörg Schindler on the Holy See's approval of the movement, claiming that Opus Angelorum believes \\"smooth-haired dogs, peasant women, gypsies and midwives are particularly susceptible to Satanic impulses, that demons love to take control in Jewish business neighbourhoods and that a long-standing apocalyptic fight between angels and the Evil One is going on.\\"Jörg Schindler: Zurück im Schoß der Kirche., 10 October 2010 Others interpreted the Holy See's statement approving the movement as instead a warning to beware of it. A possible example was the heading \\"Vatican warns of 'wayward' Opus Angelorum sect\\" given to a BBC news item the text of which stated that the warning was issued not against the Vatican-recognized movement but against some ex-members, who had either been expelled or who had left of their own accord, and who were endeavouring to form a rival \\"wayward movement\\" that would reject the norms issued by the Holy See. Christian Lichtenstern, writing in June 2017, also said that opponents of the movement's conservatism call it a sect.Christian Lichtenstern, \\"Ingo Dollinger ist tot\\" in Augsburger Allgemeine, 16 June 2017 Under the heading, \\"Who really founded the Work of Angels (Opus Angelorum)?\\", someone using the log-in name Mariat recounted in the blog of the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper the many expressions of distrust he had met with regarding the movement, expressions horrifying enough to raise goose pimples, while at the same time he mentioned that they did not fit in with what he knew of his parish priest, a member of the movement.Mariat: \\"Wer hat das 'Engelwerk' (Opus Angelorum) wirklich gegründet?\\" in the Augsburger Allgemeine, 1 June 2014.

His father was a tea-planter in Bengal, and his parents remained in India, sending Bird-Wilson to boarding school. He later went to Liverpool College. Military career On 30 November 1937, having had a few weeks initial officer training, he was granted a short-service commission in the RAF. In August 1938 he was assigned to No. 17 Squadron, learning the rudiments of being a fighter pilot in Gloster Gauntlets. The Squadron was re-equipped with Hawker Hurricanes in June 1939. Ten weeks later, he was flying a BA Swallow out of RAF Cranwell when he crashed in bad weather. His passenger was killed, and Bird-Wilson was left without a nose. He was treated by pioneering plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe, who offered Bird-Wilson the nose of his choice, and went on to treat many disfigured RAF pilots during the war. =Second World War= In April 1940 he was back on active service, in time to fly Hurricanes for the British retreat from France in the following weeks. As an already accomplished pilot, he was one of the elite selected for one of Cuthbert Orde's iconic charcoal portraits, which was drawn on 11 September 1940. On the morning of 24 September, flying Hurricane P3878 near Chatham, he became the 40th kill of Luftwaffe ace Adolf Galland of JG 26. Baling out on fire, he landed in the Thames and was picked up by a navy boat. Yet again he was hospitalised. In 1941 he went back into service as an instructor at No. 56 Operational Training Unit (OTU) before seeing action flying Spitfires with No. 234 Squadron RAF, participating in raids over northern France. He returned for a spell commanding a unit at No. 56 OTU later in the year.

In 1944 he attended command training in the US at Fort Leavenworth, before returning to action over the Normandy Invasion. He ended the war commanding No. 1335 Jet Conversion Unit, the first jet unit in the RAF. =After the war= For many years after the war Bird-Wilson held a variety of posts in the Central Flying Establishment. In 1946 he was given command of the air fighting development squadron.

Akins was a native of Spokane, Washington and attended Washington State University and later the University of Washington, where he played football and basketball. He was a key member of a University of Washington team that lost the Rose Bowl Game in 1943 to the University of Southern California. Akins played for the Browns in 1946, and subsequently joined Buffalo and Brooklyn. He won an AAFC championship with the Browns, although he did not play in the championship game due to an injury. After his playing career, Akins became an assistant football coach at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. He went on to become head coach of Southern Oregon University for 15 years starting in 1955. His coaching record at Southern Oregon was 71–62–3. Early life and high school career Akins grew up in Spokane, Washington and attended John R. Rogers High School, where he played on the basketball team and ran track. His brothers Frank and Hal were also standouts as athletes. College career Akins lettered in basketball at Washington State College in 1940 and 1941, but did not play football. By the end of 1943, Akins had transferred to the University of Washington, where many Washington State players went to train in the U.S. Navy. He played football there, starring as a halfback for the Washington Huskies. He was also said to be a good passer. The 1943 team went undefeated and was heavily favored to beat the University of Southern California in the 1944 Rose Bowl. The USC Trojans won 29–0, however. Akins fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up one of the Trojans' touchdowns. Jim Hardy, the USC quarterback, said after the game that the team's \\"only real fear was that that fellow Al Akins might get loose on the runback of a punt for a touchdown.\\" Akins also played basketball at the University of Washington in 1944, when he was a first-team All-PCC selection. That year, the Huskies basketball team won 20 games in a row and finished first in their conference. Professional career After returning from service in the Pacific in 1946, Akins signed to play for the Cleveland Browns, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He scored his only touchdown of the season on a 50-yard run in a game against the Buffalo Bisons. Cleveland defeated the AAFC's New York Yankees to win the league title that year. Akins, however, did not play in the title game because of an injury. He suffered a separated shoulder in a game against the Miami Seahawks. Akins played in 1947 for the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers. He played for the Buffalo Bills in 1948 when they faced the Browns in the AAFC championship game. Akins sat out because of an injury, and the Browns won the game. Coaching career Akins took a job as an assistant coach at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. He resigned in 1954 to seek a head coaching job, and got the top spot the following year at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. He stayed in that job for 15 seasons until 1969.

It strongly resembles a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci by Cristofano dell'Altissimo held by the Uffizi Gallery. The painting was previously thought by its owners to represent Galileo but on its discovery a claim was made that it is a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci.Richard Owen, Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci discovered in Basilicata, The Times, 2009-02-24, accessed 5 November 2010 Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci at Vinci said in 2011 that he had excluded the possibility that it was a self- portrait, but that the painting \\"remains intriguing because it adds a new element to the Leonardo puzzle\\". Painted in tempera grassa on panel, , it depicts a man in three-quarter view, with a long beard and wearing a dark hat. In 2019 it is being exhibited in Madrid along with other material related to Leonardo. It is usually in the Museo delle Antiche Genti di Lucania (Museum of the Ancient People of Lucania) in Vaglio Basilicata, a region of Southern Italy.Vinci portrait discovered in Southern Italy, Daily Contributor, 24 February 2009 In 2008 Nicola Barbatelli, Director of the Museo, discovered the painting, attributed it to Leonardo, and gave it the name Lucan portrait, from Lucania, the ancient name of Basilicata. In 2010 a conference was held at which a team comprising David Bershad, Professor at University of Calgary (Canada), Peter Hohenstatt, Professor at the University of Parma, Felice Festa, Professor of Orthodontics and Gnathology at the D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara, and Nicola Barbatelli, presented the findings in support of Barbatelli's attribution.Leonardo and the Renaissance Fantastic, Aponte Viaggo, accessed 19 November 2010 In 2017, the University of Malta refused permission for an exhibition in which the Lucan Portrait was meant to be the centrepiece, citing doubts by its art history department over the attribution to Leonardo. Nicola Barbatelli has however dismissed this decision, stating that the university did not have academics \\"with sufficient expertise on the subject\\". Provenance The painting was found in 2008 by Nicola Barbatelli, director of the Museo delle Antiche Genti di Lucania, in the private collection of an aristocratic family at Acerenza (population 3,000), a village on the river Bradano near Potenza in Basilicata. The family, who asked to remain anonymous, believed it to be a portrait of Galileo. According to Professor Peter Hohenstatt of the University of Parma, the portrait is listed on page 116 of Napoli Antica e Moderna, (1815) edited by Abate Domenico Romanelli, as being the work of Leonardo da Vinci and located in the Palazzo Baranello nella strada Cedronia of the Duke of Baranello, of the noble family Russo.Peter Hohenstatt, A Self-Portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, the \\"Lucan Painting\\": an Analysis and Attribution to Leonardo, for \\"Leonardo and the Renaissance fantastic\\" Exhibition, Sorrento, (June 2010) Description The reverse of the panel on which the portrait is painted The painting, in tempera grassa on a wooden panel made of poplar Self-portrait of Leonardo, Surrentum Online, accessed 6 November 2010 is of a man dressed in a dark garment, wearing a black hat with a small upturned brim. The man's skin is pale, his eyes blue and his hair and beard greying. The figure is set against a dark greyish monochrome background and is brightly lit from the left of the picture, illuminating the right-hand side of the sitters face, and casting a shadow across the left-hand side. The gaze of the figure is turned towards the viewer. The identification of this portrait as Leonardo da Vinci is based upon comparison with several representations of the artist including a very similar portrait in the Uffizi, the red chalk portrait in Turin and the red chalk portrait by Francesco Melzi in Windsor and others. The panel is constructed of two main vertical sections of wood of irregular width and joined with two inset butterfly joints. There are narrow horizontal sections of timber at the top and bottom of the panel. These sections have half-lapped mitre joints to the verticals, visible at the front of the panel. The rear of the panel has the words \\"PINXIT MEA\\" painted on it. It is written in Roman capital letters, in \\"mirror writing\\" so that the whole inscription is reversed and reads from right to left. The inscription runs down the left side of the reverse of the painting, rather than across it. The image on the panel is painted using a mixture of egg and oil as a medium over a ground of white gesso which is visible in damaged areas and on parts of the back of the panel. The surface of the paint has cracked down the main joint, and separated in several other places. There are several areas of abrasion to the surface of the painting, the most serious damage being two scrapes across the face, one of which extends from the nostril across the corner of the eye to the brim of his hat, and another which extends from nostril to pupil. It is apparent that there is some overpainting to the subject's left eye and cheek, and probably the mouth. There is a small curling white feather adorning the hat which is an apparent addition. Analysis Detail revealing paint, craquelure, damage and overpainting Upon its discovery by Nicola Barbatelli, the painting was subjected to an initial examination by Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci at Vinci, who confirmed that the painting appeared to be from the Renaissance period. Vezzosi was reported, in February 2009, as investigating whether the painting was the work of a minor 16th- century artist Cristofano dell'Altissimo. Altissimo executed numerous portraits of famous men for Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, some of them after the Giovio Series, including a profile of Leonardo based on the red chalk profile drawing in the Royal Collection attributed to Leonardo's companion Francesco Melzi. Vezzosi later dismissed the early conjecture that it was by dell'Altisimo. In February 2009, two months after the painting's discovery, Vezzosi had been erroneously quoted by The Times as saying he had excluded the possibility that the work was \\"a self-portrait painted by Leonardo himself\\" and that examination of the inscription \\"pinxit mea\\" on the reverse of the panel indicated that it was \\"a later addition\\". Vezzosi was later to say \\"We need to find out the exact dating of this portrait. I have excluded the possibility that we are dealing with a self-portrait painted by Leonardo himself. Nevertheless, the Acerenza portrait is intriguing because it adds a new element to the Leonardo's puzzle. Here we have Leonardo depicted as a middle-aged, blue-eyed man.\\"Discovery Channel, Da Vinci's Hidden Faces , ( Retrieved 29 June 2011) Since that time the focus of attention and research has been directed at proving the painting to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci. The Vaglia Basilicata City Council then funded an investigation by a team of scientists, many of whom were from non-art related disciplines, to report upon anything which could be tested to either support or deny the attribution to Leonardo. A preliminary cleaning of the painting was carried out, by Professor Giancarlo Napoli of the Suor Orsola Benincasa University in Naples, and revealed micro-cracking (craquelure) of the paint surface which cannot be reproduced artificially and supported a Renaissance date. Further investigation was carried out by a body of specialists in different fields including INNOVA, CIRCE, University of Naples, Cybernetics - National Research Council, and University Suor Orsola Benincasa. The INNOVA centre of the Federico II University of Naples, headed by Prof. Terrasi, researched the physical properties of the painting including the ground, medium and pigments, and identifying restored areas. Gaetano Di Pasquale of the University of Naples confirmed the wood of the panel to be Populus, common throughout Italy. Carbon 14 dating gave 64% chance the wood of the panel dated between 1459 and 1523, making it contemporary with Leonardo, who was born in 1452 and died in 1519. The pigments were investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis (ED-XRF) and were shown, in the unrestored areas, to be compatible in age with the panel and showed no trace of modern pigments in the unrestored areas; however, the feather was revealed to have been painted in a \\"modern\\" titanium-based pigment not used in other parts of the painting. The inscription PINXIT-MEA. The painting was examined with a Scanning Magnetic Microscope at a 100 μm resolution by Dr Hector Sarno of INNOVA to compose a magnetic map of the painting and to check for illegible letters. Cleaning of the back of the board revealed the reversed inscription \\"PINXIT MEA\\" written in iron gall, an ink commonly used by Leonardo. An analysis of the handwriting by graphologist Silvana Iuliano, revealed compatibility with script used by Leonardo in the Atlantic Codex. An analysis of the soft tissue of the face, applying methods used in facial surgery, was made by Prof. Felice Festa of the D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara. The painted image was subject to detailed computer analysis and 3D imaging by Prof. Orest Kormashov, University of Tallinn, Estonia; Gianni Glinni, an engineer for the Museum of Antiche Genti di Lucania, and Helen Kokk, an expert in 3D graphic design. The recreated three-dimensional image was compared with other images believed to represent Leonardo da Vinci, including the iconic red chalk in Turin, the profile drawing believed to be by Leonardo's pupil Francesco Melzi, the painted portrait in the Uffizi and the recently discovered image in the Codex on the Flight of Birds. A conclusion was that all the images, but one, reveal a face that is elongated in the lower two thirds. The image that did not comply was the red chalk so-called self-portrait in Turin, considered by some to be of Leonardo in old age. Luigi Capasso, of the D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara, and Col. Gianfranco De Fulvio, RIS-Ra.C.I.S. Command of the CarabinieriOfficial website of the Carabinieri - Raggruppamento Carabinieri Investigazioni Scientifiche (Ra.C.I.S.) led an investigation into three fingerprints they found in the paint of the Lucan painting and found one of them to be \\"unambiguous\\" with the left index fingerprint on the ebony beads of Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine. Attribution It is attributed to Leonardo by a number of historians of Art: Prof. Hoehnsttatt Peter (University of Parma),Fondazione Sorrento Alessandro Tomei (D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara), Maria Cristina Paoluzzi (D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara and Milan), Jan Royt (University of Prague),, David Bershad (University of Calgary) and Orest Kormashov (University of Tallinn)..

Sigma Psi's values are Sincerity, Faithfulness, and Fidelity.  History  The first sororities at Western Reserve University began as Greek study groups with a focus on self-improvement. On March 7, 1897, one woman broke from one of these unlettered Greek groups and she and four of her friends decided to form their own group, Sigma Psi Women's Fraternity, \\"for the intellectual and social benefits of its members.\\" These women were Elsie Davies, Cornelia Olmstead, Grace Lottridge, Edith Lottridge, and Anna Camp. The first pledge class was composed of Mary Case, Clare Metcalf, and Elizabeth Coit. All eight women are considered to be founding members of the fraternity. In 1997, Sigma Psi celebrated its centennial anniversary. A community-wide celebration was held, with alumni from across the country in attendance. The Sigma Psi common room contains an American flag that was flown over the United States Capitol by former Senator Louis Stokes in honor of the centennial, as well as a letter from then-President Bill Clinton congratulating the sorority on its accomplishment.  Symbols  Sigma Psi's colors are green and gold. The official flowers of Sigma Psi are the daffodil and the yellow rose, and the official symbol is the butterfly. Sigma Psi's official gemstones are emeralds and pearls, which edge the formal badge. The crest is a black triangle edged with gold and emblazoned with the Greek letters, surrounded by several golden wreaths. The badge is a simple black triangle featuring the Greek letters ΣΨ and edged with gold. This badge is given to all active sisters upon initiation.  Philanthropy  Sigma Psi has supported a variety of philanthropies throughout its history, but for the past several years Sigma Psi has supported the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center, a local organization whose mission is \\"to support survivors of rape and sexual abuse, promote healing and prevention and create social change.\\" In 1979, Mr. CWRU became their signature philanthropy event, a faux male beauty pageant held in November.

Montes subsequently won her second Gawad Tanglaw Award for Best Actress and received a nomination for the PMPC Star Award for Best Drama Actress when she headlined the melodrama Doble Kara (2015–17), as identical twin sisters Kara Dela Rosa and Sara Suarez. She currently stars in the lead role of Ana Dimasalang in the political drama Asintado (2018).

Other film appearances include the romantic comedy The Reunion (2012), the horror adventure The Strangers (2012) and the independent drama Padre de Familia (2016).  Early life  Julia Montes was born Mara Hautea Schnittka on March 19, 1995, in Pandacan, Manila, Philippines, to a Filipino mother, Gemma Hautea, and German father, Martin Schnittka. Schnittka left them when Montes was still a baby, and only her deaf mother raised her with the help of her grandmother, Flory Hautea. She has two younger brothers, Patrick and Paolo. She describes education as one of the tools to have a good life and she hopes to continuously work not just for herself but for her family as well. Montes has other relatives in Germany. In 2011, she finished high school with good grades at the Blessed Hope Christian School. At the age of 5, Montes began attending auditions and modeling agencies. She recalls the struggles she and her grandmother went through: commuting to castings, hurrying from school to shoots and missing a lot of family time in the process until she was cast in a milk brand, chocolate snack and fast food chain endorsements. However, she said she never competed with anyone and was just in the entertainment industry out of needs. Describing her ambitions as a child, Montes has said, \\"Since I was a child, I only had three dreams: to become a soldier, a chef and a flight attendant.\\"  Career  = 2001–2011: Career beginnings and breakthrough = Montes started as a commercial model before appearing in various television shows. She began her acting career with minor roles when she was cast in a number of GMA shows such as Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga in 2001 as the daughter of actors Robin Da Rosa and Angelu de Leon, and in some episodes of the now defunct drama anthology Magpakailanman. Montes went on to play guest roles on ABS-CBN's television shows such as Hiram (2004) and Maalaala Mo Kaya before landing a permanent spot in the kiddie gag show Goin' Bulilit in 2005. She also appeared in other television series in 2008 including Ligaw na Bulaklak and I Love Betty La Fea. These parts led her to being cast as a series regular in Goin' Bulilit in which she played various roles in different comedic situations until her departure that year. Also that year, Montes, as Abby, starred in a Maalaala Mo Kaya episode titled \\"Card\\", a story of a girl who is longing for the love of her parents while under the care of a nursemaid. The following year, she appeared in Katorse with a guest role in the series' finale episode playing a shy girl Nellie. She was then cast as the teenage Mara, a character with her same name, in the youth-oriented show Gimik 2010. In 2010, Montes' breakthrough role came when she portrayed the role of Clara del Valle/David in the remake of Emil Cruz, Jr.'s longest-running classic soap opera Mara Clara, a drama about teenage sibling rivalry, alongside her co-star and off-screen best friend Kathryn Bernardo. Montes changed her screen name from \\"Mara Montes\\" to \\"Julia Montes\\" to avoid confusion and complications, since the titular character Mara will be played by Bernardo. The finale episode of the series earned a 43.4% national ratings based on Kantar Media, making it the highest-rating teleserye episode to date aired on ABS-CBN that year. Montes' portrayal as the main antiheroine of the series received generally positive reviews and landed her lead roles in films and television series in her future projects. In 2011, Montes made her film debut in the family drama Way Back Home, which opened in August 2011 to positive reviews, as Jessica \\"Jessie\\" Lorraine S. Santiago, alongside Mara Clara co-star Kathryn Bernardo. Montes garnered largely positive reviews by critics, with Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal writing, \\"One should applaud Julia Montes for deviating from the classic snotty, mean girl character who makes life miserable for the downtrodden Mara. It is Julia’s strength to gain the sympathy of the audience while playing the angsty girl who harbors much pain. She has the ability to make her audience understand the pain her character is going through, and more importantly make them see where it is coming from. Julia was astounding.\\" That same year, she worked with Bernado for the third time in the youth-oriented show entitled Growing Up, in which she portrayed the role of Samantha \\"Tammy\\" Magtoto, the daughter of an OFW who entrusted his care to Mikaella Dimalanta (played by Bernardo). = 2012–13: Walang Hanggan and film works = In 2012, greater success came to Montes when she starred with Coco Martin in the romantic drama series Walang Hanggan. The critically acclaimed series is loosely based on the 1991 film Hihintayin Kita sa Langit, a film based on the Emily Brontë classic novel, Wuthering Heights. Walang Hanggan features the undying love that revolves around characters from three different generations – the love triangle among Virginia, Margaret, and Joseph; the ill-fated lovers Marco and Emily; and young sweethearts Daniel and Katerina. The series includes Martin as Daniel Guidotti, Richard Gomez as Marco Montenegro, Dawn Zulueta as Emily Guidotti, Susan Roces as Virginia \\"Henya\\" Cruz, Helen Gamboa as Doña Margaret Montenegro, and Montes, as Katerina Alcantara.This also marks the first on-screen team-up of Coco Martin and Julia Montes, and the reunion project of eternal loveteam Richard Gomez and Dawn Zulueta. Writing for Philippine Entertainment Portal, Mark Angelo Ching considered Montes' decision to jump to a mature role after playing a teenager in Mara Clara seemingly to be a \\"gamble\\" at first, but all doubts are dispelled once she is seen holding her own against Martin, and believed that her \\"natural naïveté\\" works against the mature outlook of the actor's character. The series and Montes' performance both earned widespread acclaim from critics as it maintained the top spot and dominated the viewers' ratings for most of its run, being the only Philippine drama of 2012 to exceed the 40% margin in ratings. The finale episode of the show garnered a 45.4% viewership rating nationwide. Walang Hanggan emerged as the most watched show during the second half of 2012, ruling the list with a whopping national TV rating of 38.4% based on Kantar Media. Due to the series' phenomenal success, Walang Hanggan was aired internationally in foreign countries along with Ina, Kapatid, Anak, and Be Careful With My Heart. The series earned Montes the title of \\"Phenomenal Primetime Princess;\\" eventually she was named as the \\"Princess of Philippine Television\\" during the 44th Box Office Entertainment Awards (GMMSFI). Martin, on the other hand, acquired the title \\"Prince of Philippine Television\\". For their rapport in Walang Hanggan, Montes and Martin also placed 2nd as the most popular loveteams at the 4th FMTM Awards. Montes then starred in other two 2012 films, as Ligaya in The Reunion, and as Pat in The Strangers. With nationwide revenues of over ₱68.1 million for the former, the film remains her highest-grossing release. In 2013, Montes starred in the romantic drama A Moment in Time alongside Martin, as a follow-up success of their preeminent team-up in Walang Hanggan. The film grossed over ₱64,543,391 nationwide, and Montes received her first nomination for the FAMAS Award for Best Actress. Jennifer Dugena of Philippine Entertainment Portal praised her performance, writing: \\"Julia plays the part with exquisitely combined innocence and maturity. She is perfect as a young woman coming-of-age to the truths and facts of life. Her vulnerability and strength shines through as she submits herself to the emotional machinations inflicted by Martin’s character Patrick. Her emotions are solid, intense and very affecting. Her acting chops slices away any doubts about her ability to portray young or adult characters. Talent-wise, she is clearly way ahead of her contemporaries.\\" Later in 2013, she appeared in a Maalaala Mo Kaya episode titled \\"Krus\\", a story about a girl named Diana who was sold to a prostitution den by her own foster mother at a young age of 15. The episode drew a nationwide audience share of 34.2%, making it the No. 1 most watched program on March 9, according to data from Kantar Media. That same year, Montes co-starred with Enchong Dee and Enrique Gil in another television series Muling Buksan Ang Puso which centers on the themes of forgiveness and second chances. Montes portrayed the role of Sarah Beltran, a role which she said in an interview was \\"tailor-fit\\" for her real age. The series ranked 10th in Top 15 programs from January to December 2013. = 2014–2018: Doble Kara and awards success = Montes' profile continued to grow in 2014 when she appeared as Mona Roque-Hidalgo, the lifelong loyal friend and secret admirer of Samuel, in the period drama series Ikaw Lamang where she reteamed with her Walang Hanggan leading man Coco Martin as Samuel Hidalgo / Gabriel Hidalgo. It also starred Kim Chiu as Isabelle Miravelez-Hidalgo / Andrea Hidalgo and Jake Cuenca as Franco Hidalgo. She received a nomination for Best Drama Supporting Actress in the series at the PMPC Star Awards for TV 2014. In January 2015 at the 13th Gawad Tanglaw (Gawad Tagapuring mga Akademisyan ng Aninong Gumagalaw) for television, Montes, tied with veteran actress Angel Locsin, won a Best Actress award for her role in Ikaw Lamang. During the same year, Montes completed work on Adolfo Alix Jr.'s family drama Padre de Familia, which was released on February 20, 2016, with Martin and Nora Aunor. Filming took place in Malaysia. After her character's departure from Ikaw Lamang, Montes starred in the romantic horror Halik sa Hangin with Gerald Anderson and JC de Vera. The film, under the direction of Emmanuel Quindo Palo, marked Montes' third collaboration with Palo and was theatrically released on January 28, 2015. Montes continued to draw praises and recognition from film critics for her role as Mia Generoso in Halik sa Hangin. In a review from Philippine Entertainment Portal, author Jocelyn Valle stated that \\"Julia, the actress, shows great commitment and earnestness in playing the character of Mia. She makes the viewer feel Mia’s emotional stages of entering into the territory of romantic love — apprehension, excitement, caution, bliss — until reality bites. She shines the brightest in the pivotal scene where Mia is suspected to becoming a mental case, and Mia has to convince everybody that she’s telling the truth.\\" Montes' performance earned her a Young Critics Circle nomination for Best Performance. Later in 2015, Dreamscape publicity head Eric John Salut confirmed on February 12, 2015 via Twitter that Montes will be reunited once again with Walang Hanggan leading man Coco Martin in an upcoming TV project. Martin and Montes reunited in a new chapter of Wansapanataym's summer special called \\"Yamishita's Treasures\\", marking the second collaboration of the two as a loveteam in television since their hit TV series Walang Hanggan. After watching the premiere of Halik sa Hangin, Martin stated in an interview that he personally requested for Montes as his leading lady for his new project because he was proud and impressed particularly by the young actress' outstanding performance in Halik sa Hangin. Montes starred as Tanya, a princess in a world of fairies, who meets Yami and helps him retrieve a treasure in her world. Wansapanataym's \\"Yamishita's Treasures\\" ran for 12 weeks, from March 22 to June 14, 2015. Later that same year, Montes appeared in an Maalaala Mo Kaya episode titled \\"Picture\\", a story about a young woman named Rosa who fell in love with a man who, unknown to her, is already married. The episode registered a national TV rating of 37.2%, making it one of the most watched episodes of Maalaala Mo Kaya that year. After accomplishing several film and television projects involving Halik sa Hangin, Wansapanataym, and in an episode of Maalaala Mo Kaya, Montes headlined Doble Kara in 2015 (co-starring Carmina Villarroel, Mylene Dizon, Ariel Rivera, Allen Dizon and Sam Milby). The series revolves around the lives and story of twins Kara and Sara, who got separated during their childhood due to Kara's urgent need of cure for leukemia. Montes assumed the roles of identical twin sisters Kara and Sara, who share the same appearance but exhibit completely different personas. Doble Kara is produced by Dreamscape Entertainment Television, and premiered on August 24, 2015. Montes received a Best Actress Award for two consecutive years at the 2016 ceremony of the 14th Gawad Tanglaw Awards, as well as a PMPC Star Award nomination in the Best Dramatic Actress category for her role. In February 2016, Star Style magazine noted in a 2016 feature that Montes seemed dedicated to developing herself as a serious actress rather than a film star. Montes starred alongside JC Santos in Wansapanataym \\"Annika Pintasera\\" on April 2, 2017 where she played as Annika de Cuadra, a rich girl who does not value the people around her. The series scored an average national TV rating of 31.7% and landed on 4th spot for the Top 10 programs in May 2017. In 2018, Montes stars in the political drama Asintado alongside Lorna Tolentino, Paulo Avelino, Shaina Magdayao, Agot Isidro, Cherry Pie Picache, and Aljur Abrenica. She plays Ana Dimasalang, a paramedic who became Gael Ojeda's personal nurse after saving him from an accident and fell in love with him; she becomes involved in an assassination plot arranged by the del Mundos and Ojedas upon witnessing their plan.  Personal life  In June 2015, Montes completed a culinary course at the Center for Culinary Arts, Manila along with her fellow actress Yam Concepcion. She is a practicing Catholic. In December 2016, Montes was reunited with her birth father, Martin Schnittka, at Bellini's, Cubao, Quezon City. She revealed via Instagram about her encounter with her father and expressed gratitude towards her German cousin Michelle Lloyd and CocoJul Bukayo fans for paving the way to meet him.  Reception and acting style  Montes has been described in the media as one of the most talented actresses of her generation, and frequently referred to as \\"Royal Princess of Drama\\", and \\"Daytime Drama Queen\\". She is noted for playing in a range of material from horror to drama and has played roles in both high-profile, mainstream productions, and low-budget independent films. Directors Emmanuel Palo and Trina Dayrit, who directed her in different Dreamscape Entertainment releases such as Walang Hanggan, A Moment in Time, Ikaw Lamang, and Doble Kara, have praised her versatility and maturity. Montes says that she finds it fitting for people to give her mature roles since she \\"acts and looks a lot more mature\\" than her age and most girls of her age. The journalist Irish Christianne Dizon of The Philippine Star has identified this as her \\"trademark\\" in many of her best projects, adding, \\"In this age where rabid love team fans compete for the No. 1 trending spot on Twitter nightly, Julia is taking the road less traveled, choosing herself as partner-in-crime instead of a good-looking boy.\\" Her Doble Kara co-star John Lapus has praised her effortless acting that makes her performance classic. She started her acting studies in Star Magic. ABS-CBN vice president Johnny Manahan has favorably compared her craft to that of Claudine Barretto and considers her \\"incandescent on screen and as an actress who is passionate about her craft\\". In 2012, The Philippine Star called her acting \\"beyond her age\\". In a 2016 interview with Star Style, Montes elaborated: > I like that I have the chance to be in someone else’s shoes. Once I portray > someone else’s life, I get to understand who that person is. It gives me a > much bigger and better perspective on everyone’s lives around me. As a role model to young people, she is particularly known for her grounded and family-oriented personality. Early in her career, Montes established a reputation for being her family's breadwinner, amidst the absence of her biological father. She managed to buy her own house at age 17 and was able to put up a salon for her grandmother, who had to sacrifice her salon business to pull their efforts together to support Montes at the start of her career. In 2016 and 2017, Montes was awarded for the Makabata Stars on the Anak TV Awards. ABS-CBN's Push.com says she is humble about her profession, saying she is \\"just a person with a job\\" to make ends meet, attracts little gossip or tabloid attention, and casual in her appearance. In 2015, she was included in Candy Magazine listing of the \\"7 Amazing Women Who Should Be Your Life Pegs\\" features. Several media publications have noted Montes' attractiveness. She appeared in Yes! magazine's annual listing of the \\"100 Most Beautiful Stars\\", topping the list with Kathryn Bernardo in 2013. From 2012 to 2016, she was included in FHM 100 sexiest women, and won Star Magic Ball's \\"Sweetheart of the Night\\", and \\"Female Star of the Night\\" awards in 2012 and 2015, respectively.  Filmography   Awards and nominations  Montes has received one FAMAS Award for Best Actress nomination, two PMPC Star Award nominations, and one Young Critics Circle Award for Best Performance nomination. From these, she has won a FAMAS Award for the German Moreno Youth Achievement. In addition, Montes won two Gawad Tanglaw Awards for Best Actress for her performances in Ikaw Lamang (2014) and Doble Kara (2015–17). She also won a Princess of Philippine Television Award for Walang Hanggan (2012). Her other accolades include four FMTM Awards for Walang Hanggan and a TV Series Craze Award for Doble Kara.

Biography Goodman holds a geological engineering degree from the Colorado School of Mines, a M.A. in anthropology from the University of Arizona, and a Ph.D. in anthropology from California Coast University. He also earned a M.B.A. from Columbia University Graduate School of Business. He was accredited by the former Society of Professional Archeologists from 1978 to 1987.Charpentier, Julia Ann, “The Comets of God: New Scientific Evidence for God,” ForeWord Reviews, January 6, 2011Book Review of The Comets of God He used to be known as a proponent of psychic archaeology. Goodman is most well known for his idea that modern man was found in California 500,000 years ago. In his book American Genesis Goodman maintains that the conventional scenario is backwards, and that modern human beings originated not in Africa, but in California, where he cites the proverbial Garden of Eden, half a million years ago. He also attributes to these early humans many discoveries considered to be much later, from pottery to insulin to \\"the applied understanding of the physics behind Einstein's gravity waves\\".quoted in Feder, Kenneth L. Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology:From Atlantis to the Walam Olum, Greenwood, 2010, pp.7-8 Later Goodman called for a Multiregional origin of modern humans.Baskin, Yvonne, “Cro-Magnon Roots Theorized- Modern Man Born In America?” The San Diego Union, March 2, 1981 > Goodman’s next book was The Genesis Mystery: the Sudden Appearance of Man and according to Paul Dean of the Los Angeles Times it is “something of an academic brush with scientific creationism, the belief that a divine surge, without explicit adherence to the Bible, created modern man… 250,000 years ago.”.Dean, Paul, “Unorthodox Scientist-Going Out on a Limb on the Origins of Man,” Los Angeles Times, February 23, 1981, View, Part V, pp. 1-2, > His more recent work has been in biblical archaeology. Flagstaff excavation Goodman began excavation at Flagstaff, Arizona in the 1970s while still a student in the archaeological graduate program at the University of Arizona. Through the help of the psychic Aron Abrahamsen, he predicted that the excavation of a 10 foot wide test pit there would find stone tools from 4 to 20 feet, a minimum date of 20,000 years at the 15 foot level, a geological disconformity at the 15 foot level, a date of 100,000 years at 20 feet, and some human and animal skeletal material at the 20 foot plus level. As predicted, except for the human skeletal material, all of these things were found.Long, Joseph, K., editor, Extrasensory Ecology: Parapsychology and Anthropology, Scarecrow Press, Inc. Metuchen, NJ & London, 1977, , pp. 313-314> In the 1979 dig season Dr. Alan Bryan of the University of Alberta and his team excavated at the site, and they found an engraved stone at 23 feet that is called the “Flagstaff Stone.” The “Flagstaff Stone” is thought by Goodman to be approximately one hundred thousand years old and according to Goodman, possibly “one of the most important artifacts ever found in the whole world”, citing in the last instance Alexander Marshack of Harvard’s Peabody Museum. 3 [Goodman 1981:214.] The archaeologist Stephen Williams wrote that \\"Marshack has said that he was badly misquoted by Goodman, and the date is arrived at by extreme extrapolation.\\"Williams, Stephen. \\"Psychic Archaeology.\\" Fantastic Archaeology: the Wild Side of North American Prehistory. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia,1991,p.301> In a review of American Genesis' by Dennis Stanford, Stanford quotes Marshack as having said that although he saw the grooves as intentional, \\"“Every groove without exception had been deepened and straightened, reworked after it was dug out of the ground . . . thus the stone cannot be used as evidence that early man engraved it.” Some have claimed the stone is a piece of tuff about two and a half inches long which according to Goodman, is 100,000 years old and is Paleo-Indian art. Human origins Goodman is the author of American Genesis: The American Indian and the origins of modern man (1981) in which he claims that homo sapiens originated in North America in California 500,000 years ago and then spread to the rest of the world. His views have been compared to the paleontologist Florentino Ameghino who believed that humanity had originated on the banks of Río de la Plata.South America, Volume 1, edited by Fritz Salomon, Stuart B. Schwartz, 1999, p. 196 Goodman claims that the fossils in North America are \\"twice as old as the oldest fully modern skull from europe\\". In his work he attempted to show that the American Indians were not only the first Americans but were the first humans on earth. Goodman allows that hominids did appear in Asia and Africa, though homo sapiens are completely American in origin according to his theory. Goodman's theory has been criticised as his explanation of the relationship between hominids and humans was vaguely discussed. However Goodman in a later book addressed the issue in The Genesis Mystery: the Sudden Appearance of Man (1983) in which he criticised natural selection and advocated a type of spiritual evolution by claiming that archaeological findings verify an unbridgeable gap between modern man and the last \\"pre-man\\" creature and advocates spiritual intervention as the explanation for the \\"sudden appearance\\" of modern man.Human evolution: a guide to the debates, Brian Regal, 2004, p. 170 According to Michael Anthony Corey: Goodman \\"appeals to an intervening supernatural force, which would have manifested itself entirely through a \\"natural\\" series of evolutionary processes\\".The natural history of Creation: Biblical evolutionism and the return of natural theology, Michael Anthony Corey, 1995, p. 91 Goodman's theories are popular amongst American Indian creationists who believe that the American Indians originated in America and had not migrated there from Asia.The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience, Volume 1, Michael Shermer, 2002, p. 560 Few scientists today give Goodman's ideas and his use of evidence much credence.Knots in a string: an introduction to native studies in Canada, Peggy Brizinski, 1989, p. 33 Comets Goodman has his own publishing company which in 2010 published the book The Comets of God-New Scientific Evidence for God which suggests that the Bible tells how God used comets to create disasters such as Noah's Flood. Julia Ann Charpentier of ForeWord Reviews writes: “Past events in the bible often have a verifiable historical or archeological basis. Though Christian fundamentalists may recoil from scientific exploration of what they believe to be unfathomable, sacred words, some experts have presented convincing theories for reinterpretation of biblical occurrences and predictions. Jeffrey Goodman, along with other scientists who preceded him, proposes that comets made an appearance in the Old Testament, one of which caused the Great Flood.” *. Criticism Most archaeologists agree that the practice of psychic archaeology can be categorized in the realm of pseudoscience and thus Goodman has received much criticism. In his book Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of the North American Prehistory, Stephen Williams says “he [Goodman] commits an intellectual crime on the very people he seeks spiritually to uplift with his discoveries, the Native Americans.” Here Williams is referring to Goodman’s excavations of Flagstaff, Arizona and his attempted re-writing of American Indian prehistory In his review of Goodman’s book The Genesis Mystery, John R. Cole points out many ways in which Goodman succeeds at creating a book that is convincingly scientific. Cole states that “Goodman has succeeded where many before him have failed: he has produced something that mimics a scientific book very well.” He goes on further mentioning figures such as: Barry Fell, Erich von Däniken and Immanuel Velikovsky, stating that Goodman has created a work that “seems to have sound, up-to-date, wide-ranging references to support his claims” unlike the former three. Cole states that Goodman's references are \\"selective, misused, or misunderstood\\".

Quickly gaining popularity, he followed the example of Makino stars such as Tsumasaburō Bandō in starting his own independent production company, Utaemon Ichikawa Productions, in 1927. It was there he first began the \\"Idle Vassal\\" (Hatamoto taikutsu otoko) series, which would become his signature role.

Purported to have been a gorget carved during the Pleistocene, this object is now widely believed to be an archaeological forgery. History The Holly Oak Gorget was claimed to have been found in 1864 near the railroad station in Holly Oak. The object was reportedly found by Hilborne T. Cresson in 1864, but was not brought to the attention of the scientific community until December 1889 or the public until February 1890. The supposed discovery of the gorget by Cresson coincides directly with the discovery of another depiction of a woolly mammoth, in France; while excavating the La Madeleine rock shelter in 1864 Édouard Lartet discovered a clear depiction of a woolly mammoth on a fragment of mammoth tusk, providing evidence that humans and mammoths might once have co-existed in Europe. Once the Holly Oak gorget had been introduced to the scientific community and the public at large, the shell was put aside and rarely mentioned in the archaeological literature of the time. It was displayed at the Peabody Museum, the Smithsonian Institution and the International Expositions of Madrid and Chicago before fading from the public eye, only to be resurrected in the 1970s when its authenticity was once again subject to debate. Description The object is a single piece of whelk shell that has an engraving of a mammoth on one surface while the opposite side is undecorated. The shell has two small perforations along one side where a cord would have been strung so as to allow the gorget to be worn around the neck. The depiction of the mammoth is oriented horizontally, along the shell, rather than vertically as is most common. This means that when worn, the mammoth is depicted with the head facing down. It now bears some damage where the object was crushed by a microscope while undergoing tests at the Smithsonian Institution in the late 20th century. Criticism =Description of discovery= In his original report, Cresson states that the pendant was discovered in a hole being dug in the peat along the Delaware River and across from the Holly Oak station of the railroad, from which the site gets its name. In another account, Cresson says that the shell was found amongst peat that was already spread across a farmers field, making it impossible to know which layer of the strata it came from, and thus determine its age. In 1890, when the entire Holly Oak assemblage was presented to the Peabody Museum, it included 275 additional artifacts. This assemblage comprised stone tools, animal bones, wood that showed evidence of having been chopped by a stone axe, a mastodon tooth, archaic projectile points, and more objects that \\"make little sense archaeologically\\". Many of the materials appear to be from the Archaic Period; however, other materials, such as the bone implements and the gorget itself, suggest an older, possible Paleoindian origin. Scientists also question the 25-year delay in bringing the find forward, for which Cresson did not have a convincing explanation. He claims that he did not understand the significance of the find at the time, although, he would undoubtedly have been aware of the artifact's significance due to the prominence of the La Madeleine carving discovered in France. Cresson also discusses a family dispute over the announcement of the discovery, as they were unwilling to risk a controversy such as had been seen with the faked mastodon pipes in the 1880s. =Shell = The shell that the gorget is made of is of a type mostly restricted to the Ohio Valley in the late Prehistoric period. This style of gorget is referred to as Fort Ancient, and is not common near Delaware. Here, Cresson's reputation does not lend him any aid. \\"The obvious inference to be drawn from this — that the shell for the engraving had been procured from an archaeological site or collection — was fortified by the discovery that Cresson had a record of theft from archaeological sites\\". Cresson was fired from the World's Columbian Exposition Survey in December 1891 for stealing some of the specimens from the Hopewell Site. In 1986, a 0.3 gram shell sample was submitted for radiocarbon dating. The tests gave an age of 1530 ± 110 B.P. which, in calibrated years, dates the pendant to A.D. 885. This date is well after the time when mammoths had become extinct in North America. The gorget was also claimed to have been found in a peat bog; taking into account the shell's basic pH, there is very little chance that the shell could have survived for 10,000 years or more in said environment. =Style= In 1892, D.G. Brinton expressed the need to be suspicious of objects purported to have been made by aboriginal artists, listing the gorget and Lenape Stone as examples of such, citing the constant recurrence of frauds, and in 1893, after having examined the gorget and Lenape Stone, deemed both to have been recently made. Several people who have viewed the Holly Oak gorget have commented on how similar the drawing is to the La Madeleine tusk. Frederick Ward Putnam of the Peabody Museum, Thomas Wilson of the United States National Museum, Daniel Brinton of the University of Pennsylvania, and even Cresson himself, have all discussed the similarities present between the two objects. At the time the shell became public, there were less than a half-dozen depictions of a mammoth available, and of those the La Madeleine drawing is by far the clearest depiction. At the time of the Holly Oak pendant, as there were so few ways known of drawing a mammoth, the marked similarities between the two were not thought of as being unduly suspicious. David Meltzer lists several parallels between the two. They both have the same orientation and posture, and while most mammoths are shown with bulbous feet, the feet of both the Holly Oak and La Madeleine mammoths end abruptly; in La Madeleine's case, this was because part of the carving is missing, but there is room on the Holly Oak gorget where the ends of the feet could have been drawn. Furthermore, the contour of the back of the animal was drawn several times on the La Madeleine tusk, but only once on the Holly Oak gorget - the latter resembles more a modern elephant than a mammoth, which is consistent only with Charles Rau's drawing of the La Madeleine tusk, which was one of the few drawings available to the public. The trunk and tusks also more resemble those of a modern elephant than those of a mammoth, as if the artist misinterpreted the drawing. Kraft and Thomas, who believe that it is possible that the gorget may be authentic, do list this explanation among the possible theories for the artifact's existence. There is, in general, a consensus that the gorget was faked using the drawing by Rau as being the most logical explanation for the manufacture of the object.

Stevens is known for his paintings and tonal pastels depicting the rural Southern landscape, abstractions of nature, and non-objective works. His paintings are in the collections of over forty museums in the US, including the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Life  Will Henry Stevens was born in Vevay, Indiana, a town along the Ohio River. His father was an apothecary and taught Stevens the elements of chemistry and techniques of emulsions, which were later to play a large part in Stevens' experiments with different media. Working with his father, Stevens learned to grind and mix his own paints, skills which later enabled him to develop new formulas for pastel chalks. Stevens studied at the Cincinnati Art Academy for three years before leaving the Academy to begin working at the Rookwood Pottery as a painter/designer beginning in 1904. While there, Stevens met his wife, Grace Hall, a fellow designer. In 1906, Stevens made the first of many visits to New York. He studied for a while at the Art Students League, but was dissatisfied by the classroom style of William Merritt Chase, and soon dropped out. Stevens was featured in several exhibitions at the New Gallery on 30th Street, which displayed an active interest in the more contemporary art movements under the guidance of its owner, Mary Beacon Ford. At the New Gallery, Stevens met and received the encouragement of Jonas Lie, Van Dearing Perrine, and Albert Pinkham Ryder. Stevens received his first one-man exhibition at the New Gallery in March 1907. Ryder was pleased with the work and asked to meet the artist. Walking around the gallery with Stevens, Ryder commented, “Now remember, you are a poet. Don’t go do what so many painters are doing today—painting out before nature all the time. Just walk out in the pleasant time of the evening.” Stevens took a teaching position in Louisville, KY around 1912 and remained there for nearly a decade. He exhibited regionally, and by the early 1920s had shown in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and New Orleans. For many years, Stevens made annual trips to New York to keep in touch with colleagues and stay abreast of contemporary art. He also spent every summer in the mountains of North Carolina, teaching summer classes and painting the woods and hillsides. In 1921, he was invited to join the faculty of Newcomb College in New Orleans where he remained until his retirement in 1948. As in New York, Stevens quickly became part of a community of painters and writers, through which Stevens maintained an active contact with a wide range of ideas and cultural changes, while still quietly pursuing his own idiosyncratic path.  Innovator  Because of his year-round commitments to Newcomb and various summer schools, Stevens was not able to spend extended lengths of time in the studio. This suited his propensity to wander, work, and teach out-of-doors, and he began to rely on media and methods that encouraged spontaneity. Most of his works were achieved on modestly scaled paper, which could be transported easily and worked on site. The proliferation of modernist issues, occurred coincidentally with Stevens moving away from studio-oriented easel painting and toward the use of more versatile materials and gestural techniques. His reliance on drawing, with charcoal, pastel, and watercolor, led him naturally to place greater importance on the graphic structure of his composition. This new direction also revived Stevens’ earlier interest in Sung painting, and its underlying philosophy of the artist as an extension of nature. He began to experiment with a pastel medium of his own invention, which would also be conducive to a freer creative process. Stevens developed formulas for a fixative and binder, and a whole sequence of emulsions, from tempera with egg and oil to wax, which made his pastel pigments colorfast and virtually unsmudgeable. He used these in such a range of combinations that they are today almost impossible to distinguish. But perhaps his most interesting technical innovation was to allow random strokes and blots of color to float onto and penetrate a prepared wet paper, thus defining of themselves the starting point for the emergence of the final image—this independently of the experiments with accident and chance of the Dada and Surrealist painters His style had become characterized by the direct, gestural application of lines and tones, which were energized by clusters of flickering color notations. This visual shorthand had parallels with some of the most advanced techniques of his day.  Influences  As an artist, Stevens' interest in nature as subject matter was inspired by his well-documented enthusiasm for the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman. During his years at the Cincinnati Art Academy, Stevens recalled little he liked except the subtly abstracted works of the Impressionist John Henry Twactman, whose influence is apparent in Stevens’ early landscapes. Other influences at that time included James Abbott McNeill Whistler. During a trip to Washington, D.C. in the early 1900s, Stevens discovered an exhibition of Chinese paintings on silk from the Sung Dynasty at the Freer Gallery. Stevens admired their abstract qualities. Regarding the bold black and white linearity, rendered with authority on such a tentative, soft ground, Stevens remarked, \\"I could not look at Sung without realizing that it had the same kind of philosophy that I had discovered in Whitman.\\" Stevens clearly experienced in the Sung aspect of oriental art that which the impressionists found in Japanese prints, an affirmation of the two-dimensionality of the picture plane.Pennington (1993) p. 14 Art historian, Jessie Poesch wrote that, \\"the selection by the Sung artists of the salient essences of forms, rather than the explicit and detailed delineation of them, obviously appealed to Stevens, as did, apparently, the sense of line on the surface, the network of lines and forms that suggested distance, rather than clearly defined sense of recession found in most western painting up to the early twentieth century. Seeking more information on Oriental Art and philosophy, Stevens eventually came to the teachings of Lao-Tzu, in which Stevens saw creative parallels to the poetry of Walt Whitman. What Stevens felt all of these diverse sources held in common was an attitude toward the world, summed up in Stevens' own statement, \\"The best thing a human can do in life is to get rid of his separateness or selfness and hand himself over to the nature of things—to this mysterious thing called the Universal Order, that any artist must sense...In human nature we are consciously trying to achieve an order. And we are distressed by it, by the task of patterning it on an Order that is not personal or human—that is what I call spiritual.\\" In the late 1920s and early 1930s during visits to New York Stevens discovered the works of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Their works, particularly, were a revelation, and confirmation of Stevens' own sense of aesthetic direction. Stevens began to work in a \\"non-objective\\" mode while he continued to produce his more \\"objective\\" landscapes. In a taped interview with Bernard Lemann, Stevens observed,\\"I do not draw a line between objective and non-objective (painting)...I am doing both and will continue to, so long as either seems vital to me.\\"  Legacy  Will Henry Stevens, No. 1438, pastel on paper In 2006, Lynn Hill, great niece of Stevens, and John Cram, owner of Blue Spiral 1 gallery, who has handled the Stevens Estate for over twenty-five years, established the Will Henry Stevens Revolving Loan Fund. The Fund is a permanently endowed revolving loan fund assisting two regional land trusts, the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy and the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, to protect significant land and rivers in Western North Carolina. It enables the groups to respond quickly to properties imminently threatened by development. Originally built in the early 1800s and designated as New Hampshire's oldest covered bridge, the Bagley Covered Bridge crossed the Warner River until being carefully dismantled in 1966. It remained preserved in storage for 42 years and in February 2008, a gift was made to the Bascom Center for Visual Arts in Highlands, NC by Dorothy and Jimmy Coleman and Dian and Tom Winindger in honor of the New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts. Rebuilt as the entrance to the Bascom and renamed the Will Henry Stevens Covered Bridge, it is made of old growth white pine. It is one lane, 14 feet wide, and 87-1/2 feet long.

The work was one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. On November 2, 2010, the painting sold at a New York auction for $68.9 million, a record price for an artwork by Modigliani.Modigliani nude fetches $68.9M at auction, CBC News November 3, 2010 The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. Simultaneously abstracted and erotically detailed, they exhibit a formal grace referencing nude figures of the Italian Renaissance while at the same time objectifying their subjects' sexuality; they \\"exemplify his position between tradition and modernism\\".Klein, Mason, et al, 21 The nudes of this period are \\"displayed boldly, with only the faintest suggestion of setting.... neither demure nor provocative, they are depicted with a degree of objectivity. Yet the uniformly thick, rough application of paint— as if applied by a sculptor's hand— is more concerned with mass and the visceral perception of the female body than with titillation and the re-creation of translucent, tactile flesh\\".Klein, Mason, et al, 21 This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend Leopold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.Klein, Mason, et al, 61-62 The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favor to his friend, or with an eye to their \\"commercial potential\\", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.Klein, Mason, et al, 62-63 The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is \\"notorious\\" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity.Klein, Mason, et al, 56 The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.Klein, Mason, et al, 56 According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show, four of them titled Nu; \\"the present work may have been among these pictures.... the models' permissiveness and the artist's accessibility to them implied that these oils were post coital-renderings, the women still flush and basking in the afterglow\\".Sotheby's, Catalogue of the Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sale, November, 2, 2010 p.22 In 1999 Nude Sitting on a Divan sold at Sotheby's for $16.7 million, a record price for a painting by the artist.$68.9 Million Modigliani Gets Auction Season Off to a Healthy Start, The New York Times, November 2, 2010 The most recent sale far surpassed the pre-sale estimate of $40 million, as well as the previous record for one of Modigliani's works, $52.6 million for a sculpture.

This entity classification election is made by filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8832. Absent filing the form, a default classification applies. U.S. corporations of the type that can be publicly traded must be treated as corporations. There is a list of specific foreign entities that must be treated as corporations.26 CFR 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) The election is effective for Federal income tax purposes. If an entity is not classified as a corporation, it is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes if it has more than one owner, or is treated as a \\"disregarded entity\\" if it has a single owner (i.e. is treated as part of the single owner). The classification of either a U.S. or non-U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes has no effect for purposes other than U.S. income tax. Eligibility to make an election An entity, which is eligible to make an election, is referred to as an eligible entity. Generally, a corporation organized under U.S. federal or state statute (and referred to as a corporation, body corporate or body politic by that statute) is not an eligible entity. However, the following types of business entity are treated as eligible entities: #An eligible entity that previously elected to be an association taxable as a corporation by filing Form 8832. An entity that elects to be classified as a corporation by filing Form 8832 can make another election to change its classification, subject to the 60-month limitation rule. #A foreign eligible entity that became an association taxable as a corporation under the foreign default rule described below. #A foreign corporation that is not identified as a corporation under Treasury regulations §301.7701-2(b)(8). If a foreign corporation is not identified on the list included in these regulations, it qualifies as an eligible entity.

The IRS uses the information entered on the form to establish the entity's filing and reporting requirements for federal tax purposes.IRS Form 8832: Entity Classification Election Certain domestic and foreign entities that were in existence before January 1, 1997, and have an established federal tax classification generally do not need to make an election to continue that classification. If an existing entity decides to change its classification, it may do so subject to the 60-month limitation rule.Treasury regulations §301.7701-3(b)(3) and (h)(2). Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a domestic eligible entity will be classified by default as: # A partnership if it has two or more members. # Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner. A change in the number of members of an eligible entity classified as an association (defined below) does not affect the entity's classification. However, an eligible entity classified as a partnership will become a disregarded entity when the entity's membership is reduced to one member and a disregarded entity will be classified as a partnership when the entity has more than one member. Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a foreign eligible entity will be classified by default as: # A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have limited liability. # An association taxable as a corporation if all members have limited liability. # Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability. The effect of these rules is that a U.S. limited liability company (LLC) or limited liability partnership (LLP) is treated by default as a partnership (or disregarded entity if it has only one owner), whereas a foreign LLP is treated by default as a corporation (if, as is generally the case, all its members have limited liability). If an entity has been operating under one classification for some time, but then elects to change its classification, there may be tax consequences. The initial regulations were unclear on this point, so the IRS issued Revenue Rulings 99-5 and 99–6 in 1999 to address questions surrounding the conversion of an LLC to a partnership and vice versa.Clarifying Entity Classification Conversions, Steven M. Friedman & Samuel H. Hoppe, Commercial Investment Real Estate Magazine, July/August 1999. Use in international tax planning The \\"check-the-box\\" regulations paved the way for various new tax avoidance and tax deferral strategies.Analyzing Subpart F in light of Check-the-Box, Cynthia Ram Sweitzer, Akron Tax Journal 20, March 2005. See pp. 9-11, 23 Specifically, they expanded the opportunity for \\"hybrid branch\\" or \\"hybrid entity\\" strategies, which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions, in order to engage in cross-border tax arbitrage. The possibility that the check-the-box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation, and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all; however, in the end, the IRS, while acknowledging such concerns, issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification. US owners of foreign subsidiaries benefit from the ability to have those foreign subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities. Under the United States' Internal Revenue Code Subpart F, payments between related Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), or from American companies to related CFCs, may be \\"treated as Subpart F income\\" (subject to current taxation as if they were profits in the hands of the ultimate American owner of the corporate structure), in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to defer US tax on the income of foreign corporations they control. However, payments between an American-owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation, and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity, are not treated as Subpart F income.'Unchecking the Box' Could Lead to Fierce Debate, CFO Magazine, May 11, 2009 This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non-American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other, e.g. through thin capitalization. Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check-the-box regulations consists of US flow-through entities (S corporations and partnerships) with foreign subsidiaries. If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation, the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a foreign tax credit for the US owner under Section 902. However, with a check-the-box election to be treated as a disregarded entity, the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner, thus giving rise to the tax credit.\\"Check- the-Box: Not Always the Right Answer for Certain Foreign Corporations\\". Robert Patelski, The Tax Adviser 37(4), April 2006.Internal revenue regulations §1.902 For US owners with foreign subsidiaries, choosing to have a subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity is not always the most beneficial tax-planning choice, however. For example, if a US taxpayer owns a disregarded foreign entity, its income will be taxed at the owner's ordinary US income tax rates, less the foreign tax already paid. This may result in every marginal dollar being taxed at the highest rate. However, if the foreign entity had elected to be taxed as a corporation (or been classified as such by default), paid a low rate tax in the foreign country, then repatriated its income to the US by paying qualified dividends to its owner, the total proportion of tax paid on income might actually be less, as qualified dividends are only taxed at 15%. However, this treatment is only available for dividends from corporations in certain countries, and is set to sunset in 2010 under the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. Foreign owners of US corporations also benefit from the ability to have entities normally treated as flow- through instead be taxed as corporations by the IRS. In what is sometimes known as a \\"domestic reverse hybrid\\" strategy, a non-US corporation may set up a US holding company which elects to be treated as a corporation for US tax purposes, but which its home country tax law sees as a flow-through entity. The US holding company receives a loan from its home country parent which it invests in a US operating subsidiary; the US holding company receives dividends from the US operation subsidiary and pays interest to the non-US parent. US tax law thus sees a US company making a dividend payment to another US company (which is thus not subject to withholding tax, unlike a dividend paid to a foreign company) which then pays interest to a foreign company, while the home country tax law will see a US company paying dividends directly to its home country parent. Under typical treaties for the relief of double taxation, neither government has the right to tax the payment, because each sees it as a type of payment which only the other has the right to tax. History Prior to 1996, whether domestic and foreign entities were classified as corporations was based on a six-factor test which looked at:One Nation Among Many: Policy Implications of Cross-Border Tax Arbitrage, Diane M. Ring, Boston College Law Review 44(1), December 1, 2002. See pp. 96-98. #limited liability; #continuity of life; #free transferability of interests; #centralized management; #associates; #objective to carry on business for joint profit An entity which had a preponderance of the first four factors (the last two, in practice, were shared by all business entities) was treated as a corporation, otherwise as a partnership or an association.Internal Revenue Manual, Part 4. Examining Process, Chapter 61. LMSB International Program Audit Guidelines, Section 5. Entity Classification, Internal Revenue Service, May 1, 2006 In practice, however, this test was easily manipulated. The \\"check-the-box\\" regulations (Treasury Decision 8697) were adopted in 1996 in order to simplify the issue of entity classification. A grandfather clause allowed entities in existence on May 8, 1996 to continue using their previous classification, even if they would no longer be eligible to elect that classification under the new rules.Internal Revenue Service Adopts \\"Check-the- Box\\" Classification Regulations, Partnership Tax Bulletin, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, December 1996 There were three conditions for this grandfathering: #the entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for its claimed classification; #the entity and all owners recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in classification within 60 months prior to January 1, 1997; and #neither the entity nor its owners had been advised that the entity was under examination on or before May 8, 1996. The initial regulations also included a list of foreign entities which would always be classified as corporations (\\"per-se corporations\\") and which could not elect to be disregarded. The proposed regulations included naamloze vennootschap formed under the laws of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles in that list, but they were removed from the final list; conversely, Canadian corporations were added to the list. In 1998, the IRS issued Notice 98–11, 1998-1 C.B. 433 in an attempt to combat the use of \\"check-the-box\\" in international tax planning (see below); however, the notice met opposition, and was withdrawn by Notice 98–35, 1998-2 C.B. 34. Another proposal, around 1999, would have left the basic check-the-box regime in place, but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with \\"extraordinary transactions\\" (where the tax liability changes \\"significantly\\" as a result of the election). An \\"extraordinary transaction\\" was defined as one in which there was a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored, and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation, if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction.Comments on changes in entity classification: special rule for certain foreign eligible entities. Tax Executive, April 4, 2000 However, various tax professionals opposed the changes, arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low, and that existing internal revenue regulations, as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of substance over form and the step transaction doctrine, were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check-the-box rules.Entity classification simplification not that simple, Shawn Carson & John Santa Maria, The Tax Adviser, May 1, 2000 President Barack Obama attempted to revive the IRS' 1998 notice in his proposed 2010 budget. Specifically, the proposal stated:General Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2010 Revenue Proposals , Department of the Treasury, May 2009. See p. 28. The proposal was eventually dropped again due to criticism from businesses, and it was not included again in the 2011 budget proposal either.Obama’s 2011 Budget: Check- the-Box off the Table; Subpart F Expanded Morgan Lewis Tax Flash, February 2, 2010 References Category:Corporate law Category:Corporate taxation in the United States Category:International taxation ","title":"Entity classification election"},{"id":"29479749","text":"Onwards is the first studio album from the Norwegian heavy metal band Triosphere.

The phenomenon has attracted attention from the media, political commentators, songwriters,http://www.richardshindell.com/index.php?page=songs&category;=vuelta&display;=63 and Cuban American activists due to the popularity of the T-shirt design, Che's political beliefs, and the \\"irony\\" of buying a T-shirt depicting a Marxist icon. As op-ed commentator Chris Berg noted in The Age, \\"Ironically, Che Guevara's longevity as a cultural symbol has been thanks to the very economic system he sought to destroy\\".  Popularity  Che Guevara's image is a popular design for clothing, so much so that Che's likeness has been known as \\"the face that launched a thousand T-shirts\\". Commentators have noted how the T-shirt is popular among younger adults, especially university students drawn to the rebelliousness associated with the icon. Richard Castle of the Brisbane Times wryly observes that \\"strolling down Brunswick Street or Chapel Street, it could be easy to think Che Guevara was the only man under 40 never to have worn a Che Guevara T-shirt\\". The recent popularity of Che-related fashion has been attributed to economic troubles, which make Che's message more appealing.  History  The image depicted on Che chic is based on the Guerrillero Heroico photograph. It is unknown when the photo was first used as a fashion design, although it was first given an artistic rework in a series of 1967 posters by the Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick.Trisha Ziff, Che Guevara: Revolutionary & Icon, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 21  Response  The popularity of the trend has been criticised for downplaying Che's perceived flaws and romanticising his actions. Critics claim that youth support the icon without being aware of the controversial figure behind it, who has been accused of using violence as a means to achieve his objectives and driving Cuba into economic disaster. Critics have called the trend a \\"T-shirt fad\\". Members of the Cuban exile community have voiced opposition to Che chic and other depictions of Che as a pop cultural icon for the same reasons. Aleida Guevara, the eldest daughter of Che Guevara, has defended the fashion trend derived from her father's image, saying, \\"But look at the people who wear Che T-shirts. They tend to be those who don't conform, who want more from society, who are wondering if they can be better human beings. That, I think, he would have liked\\".

It is named after Everett C. Olson. There was a hiatus and a sudden change in between the early Permian and middle/late Permian faunas. Since then this event has been realized across many groups, including plants, marine invertebrates, and tetrapods.  Identification  The first evidence of extinction came when Everett C. Olson noted a hiatus between early Permian faunas dominated by pelycosaurs and therapsid-dominated faunas of the middle and late Permian. First considered to be a preservational gap in the fossil record, the event was originally dubbed 'Olson's Gap'. To compound the difficulty in identifying the cause of the 'gap', researchers were having difficulty in resolving the uncertainty which exists regarding the duration of the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Theories emerged which suggested the extinction was prolonged, spread out over several million years or that multiple extinction pulses preceded the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The impact of Olson's Extinction amplified the effects of the Permian–Triassic extinction event and the final extinction killed off only about 80% of species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses. During the 1990s and 2000s researchers gathered evidence on the biodiversity of plants, marine organisms and tetrapods that indicated an extinction pulse preceding the Permian–Triassic extinction event had a profound impact on life on land. On land Sahney and Benton showed that even discounting the sparse fossil assemblages from the extinction period, the event can be confirmed by the stages of time bracketing the event since well preserved sections of the fossil record from both before and after the event have been found and they referred to the event as 'Olson's Extinction'. The 'Gap' was finally closed in 2012 when Michael Benton confirmed that the terrestrial fossil record of the Middle Permian is well represented by fossil localities in the American Southwest and European Russia and that the gap is not an artifact of a poor rock record since there is no correlation between geological and biological records of the Middle Permian. Despite the closure of Olson's Gap, the presence of an extinction event at the Kungurian–Roadian boundary was still disputed. It was argued that the observed decrease in diversity might be due to the shift in the location of greatest sample size from the palaeo-equatorial to the palaeo-temperate regions: equatorial regions tend to have a higher diversity in most modern groups. However, a thorough review of the tetrapod-bearing formations during the Kungurian and the Roadian found evidence that the faunal turnover at this time is not a result of the shift in sampling locality; the early Permian temperate faunas are more similar to the early Permian equatorial faunas than the middle Permian temperate faunas. It was also shown that throughout the Permian, the highest diversity was found in temperate regions rather than equatorial regions, and therefore the fall in diversity could not be due to increased sampling of temperate latitudes.  Possible causes  There is no widely accepted theory for the cause of Olson's Extinction. Recent research has indicated that climate change may be a possible cause: extreme environments were observed from the Permian of Kansas which resulted from a combination of hot climate and acidic waters particularly coincident with Olson's Extinction. Whether this climate change was a result of Earth's natural processes or exacerbated by another event is unknown.  Extinction patterns  = On land = Plants Plants showed large turnover in the mid-to-late Permian and into the Triassic. The duration of higher extinction rates (>60%) in land plants was about 23.4 Myr, starting from Olson's Extinction and into the early Middle Triassic. Olson's Extinction represents the third highest peak of extinction rates seen in plants throughout the Paleozoic, and the number of genera fell by 25%. The extinction was particularly severe among free-sporing plants; seed plants seem to have been largely unaffected. Tetrapods The Permian was a time of rapid change for tetrapods; in particular there was a major changeover from faunas dominated by basal synapsids (\\"pelycosaurs”) and reptiliomorphs (Diadectes) to faunas dominated by therapsids (Dinocephalia, Anomodontia, Gorgonopsia, and Cynodontia) some of which were direct ancestors of mammals. In 2008 Sahney and Benton confirmed that this was not just a turnover (gradual replacement of one faunal complex by another) but a real extinction event in which a significant drop in the biodiversity of tetrapods on a global scale and community level occurred. The extinction appears to have taken place in two phases: Edaphosauridae and Ophiacodontidae died out across the Kungurian–Roadian boundary, while Caseidae and Therapsida diversified; later in the Roadian Sphenacodontidae died out and Caseidae went into decline. Olson's extinction appears to have been the highest Paleozoic peak in extinction rate observed in Eureptilia, exceeding even the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. Amphibians were also particularly hard-hit. In December 2011, the fossilized remains of the 'youngest' pelycosaur was described by Modesto et al. as from 260 million years ago in South Africa, the first evidence that one of these animals survived Olson's Extinction. This type of animal is called a disaster taxon, an organism that survives a major environmental disruption, perhaps forming the basis for a new adaptive radiation. = In the water = Fish Extinction rates in fish increased noticeably between the Cisuralian and the Guadalupian, the time of Olson's extinction. However, origination rates also rose, and so there does not appear to have been any substantial decrease in species richness. Using data on chondrichthyan diversity, Koot showed that there was little substantial decline in diversity until the middle of the Guadalupian.Koot, M.B. 2013. Effects of the late Permian mass extinction on chondrichthyan palaeobiodiversity and distribution patterns Recovery Fauna did not recover fully from Olson's Extinction before the impact of the Permian- Triassic extinction event. Estimates of recovery time vary, where some authors indicated recovery was prolonged, lasting 30 million years into the Triassic. Several important events took place during Olson's Extinction, most notably the origin of therapsids, a group that includes the evolutionary ancestors of mammals. Further research on the recently identified primitive therapsid of the Xidagou Formation (Dashankou locality) in China of Roadian age may provide more information on this topic.

The coup's failure demoralized the Legion's belief in Westerling and he was forced to flee to Singapore. Without a strong leader, APRA had ceased to function by February 1950.

Republican candidate for re-election on August 18, 2020. He has been a member of the Alaska House of Representatives from District 2 in Fairbanks since 2011. He previously served as mayor of Fairbanks from 2001 to 2007. Early life Steve Thompson was born in Cottage Grove, Oregon. He attended Southern Oregon College from 1963 to 1965 before joining the U.S. Army, where he attained the rank of sergeant. His last duty station was at Fort Wainwright, adjacent to Fairbanks, Alaska. After being discharged from the Army, he remained in Fairbanks and went to work for a local business, M & O Auto Parts. Thompson eventually became the president and CEO of M & O, selling it to the Schuck's Auto Supply chain in 1999. Political career Thompson, retired from business, ran for the position of mayor of Fairbanks in 2001. The seat was open, as the incumbent, James C. Hayes, was term-limited. At the time, Thompson was manager of the Fairbanks lodge of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. He defeated five other challengers, including two incumbent members of the city council, Scott Kawasaki and Charlie Rex. Thompson was unopposed for re- election in 2004. In 2007, himself term-limited, Thompson ran for and won a seat on the city council. He resigned shortly thereafter, citing problems related to the illness and death of his wife, Janel. Thompson ran for another open seat, this time in the Alaska House of Representatives, in 2010. The incumbent, Jay Ramras, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he defeated Vivian Stiver, a downtown Fairbanks merchant and city council member who ran unsuccessfully in 2007 to replace him as mayor, and 92-year-old Urban Rahoi, the owner of a large mobile home park immediately outside of Fairbanks city limits and a perennial candidate who first ran for a House seat from Fairbanks in 1962, running almost continuously for most of the period between the early 1970s and early 1990s. In the general election, he defeated John S. Brown, who had also unsuccessfully challenged Ramras in 2008. Thompson has served 5 consecutive terms since 2010 and is currently running for his 6th term in the Alaska House of Representatives. Personal life Thompson's first wife, Janel, died of cancer. The Fairbanks North Star Borough named parkland adjacent to the Chena River after her. Thompson married his second wife, Kathleen, in 2009. He has 5 children: Todd, Scott, Natalie, Aaron, and Max. Todd, an employee of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, was heavily involved in the political battle in Fairbanks over eliminating emissions testing during the time his father served as mayor.

After making a single round-trip to Portland, Maine, during which it ignited a trackside fire, the train served in commuter service on the railroad's Eastern and Western routes until 1965. Two separate fires in 1963 and 1965 caused two of the three articulated cars to be removed from service, after which it sat idle in the yard adjacent to the Boston Engine Terminal (aka the Engine House) in Charlestown, Massachusetts. In its last year of service, the trainset was renowned for constant breakdowns, consequently spending an inordinate amount of time in the shops. Thus, the decision was made to remove it from active service. Eventually, eight segments of the passenger cars were sold to a private restaurateur in Chelsea, Massachusetts, who incorporated three segments into his restaurant and stored the remaining five on the property.

The incident became an international topic of news and analysis, which expanded to become an internet meme. On the issue of copyright, the incident illustrates that \\"masses of Internet users are very good at finding examples of copyright infringement, which counterbalances how easy the Internet has made plagiarism in the first place.\\" At the same time, the response by the Cooks Source editor \\"may well become a digital textbook example of how not to respond to grievances in the internet age.\\"Smith, Matt (November 5, 2010).

The magazine stated its goal was \\"to help educate readers about sustainable sources of foods and products, farms, cooking, restaurants and businesses,\\" and to provide a marketing tool for small businesses and farms which create and sell food for local businesses and consumers. At the time of the incident, Cooks Source was published by Cooks Source Publications in the second-floor office of a rented duplex in Sunderland, Massachusetts, almost north of Springfield. Griggs, who was 59 years old at the time of the incident, hand-delivered the monthly publication with her adult daughter along a 2,000-mile distribution route to locations in western New England, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and some of New Hampshire. The magazine's circulation varied, but it was under 10,000 a month.

Biography =Early life= Robert Lavern Shannon was born 1945 in Port Gibson, Mississippi. =Career= Shannon achieved a record of 192-34 in 20 seasons at East St. Louis. In 1985 he was selected as the USA Today High School Football Coach of the Year along with taking the High School Football National Championship. Shannon accused the school district of condoning corruption. He claimed the athletic director stole from the district. He left in 1995 after the school board backed the athletic director, who later plead guilty to stealing $90,000 from athletic accounts. Janet Reno awarded Shannon the United States Attorney General Award, an award rarely given outside of law enforcement, for his efforts to fight corruption. He coached Alton and Christian Brothers College High School before retiring from coaching in 2007 at the age of 63. Shannon and the East St. Louis Flyers were the subject of the book The Right Kind of Heroes, by newspaper reporter Kevin Horrigan, who is now a columnist with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The book chronicles the Flyers' 1990 and 1991 seasons, during which they lost the state championship and then won it back. Shannon coached pro football players Dana Howard and Bryan Cox and baseball player Homer Bush, then a high school football star during his tenure at East St. Louis. Two years after retiring, Shannon was inducted into the St. Louis Metro Football Coaches Association hall of fame. George H. W. Bush recognized Shannon as \\"a beacon of hope in a sea of despair.\\" Bill Clinton named Shannon one of his 53 faces of hope during his 1992 presidential campaign. Shannon was selected for overcoming difficulties and leading his team to success. He was invited to lunch prior to the inauguration with Clinton and attended the inauguration.

Due to its classic Googie architecture and tenure in the area, the dealership building, built in 1949, has become an architectural landmark in the San Fernando Valley. History Casa de Cadillac opened in 1950 at 14401 Ventura Boulevard and has operated continuously in the same facility since that time. The dealership originally opened in 1949 as Don Lee Motors which was part of the Don Lee organization that operated Cadillac dealerships throughout the state of California, including major cities such as Fresno, Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Pasadena, and Los Angeles. Ownership of the dealership passed from Lee to Martin Pollard in 1950 who changed the name to Casa de Cadillac. Pollard was influential in local business and an active member of the San Fernando Valley community. He served at various times as the President of Valley Presbyterian Hospital, President of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, and was the first chairman of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority. In 1959, Pollard was the first ever recipient of the \\"Fernando Award\\" given by the Fernando Award Foundation in recognition of outstanding community volunteerism in the San Fernando Valley. Upon Pollard's death in 1970, the Sherman Oaks branch of the Los Angeles Public Library was named in his honor. After Pollard's death, James Wilson became president of Casa de Cadillac and was active in its daily operations through 2008. During that time, Casa Automotive Group (the parent company of Casa de Cadillac) acquired several additional franchises including Buick, GMC, Hummer, Saab, Kia, and Subaru. In 2008, Wilson passed ownership to his daughter and son-in-law, Susan and Howard Drake. Today, Cadillac, Buick and GMC are sold at the Sherman Oaks location while Subaru is sold at a separate dealership in nearby Van Nuys. Architecture Designed by Randall Duell in 1948, Casa de Cadillac is now considered a prime example of Googie architecture. It has been included in modern architectural walking tours organized by the Modern Committee of the Los Angeles Conservancy and Los Angeles Times and has become a popular location for photography and filming.

Some of these characters also appear in the novels Baifa Monü Zhuan and Saiwai Qixia Zhuan. Mount Heaven Sect * Ling Weifeng (), nicknamed \\"Holy Light of Mount Heaven\\" (天山神芒) after his famous anqi (projectile weapon), was previously known as Liang Mulang (). Years ago, he was tricked into revealing the identities of the anti-Qing rebels. He attempted suicide in guilt after being slapped and accused by Liu Yufang, whom he had a crush on, but refrained from doing so upon encountering a dying Yang Yuncong. He follows Yang's instructions and brings Yang's orphaned daughter to Reverend Huiming. He becomes Huiming's third apprentice and becomes as a formidable swordsman after training for 18 years. However, he has a strong tendency to suffer from seizures when exposed to cold weather. This becomes his fatal weakness, as he experiences a sudden fit during a fight with Chu Zhaonan when he is just about to slay his opponent. Chu turns the tables on him and captures him, imprisoning him in a labyrinth in Tibet. Chu Zhaonan also cuts off his right thumb, preventing him from using a sword again. Ling survives his ordeal and continues his heroic quest as a Mount Heaven swordsman dedicated to upholding justice and helping the poor and oppressed. * Yilan Zhu () is Yang Yuncong and Nalan Minghui's daughter. She was brought to Mount Heaven by Ling Weifeng, and raised and trained in martial arts by him and Reverend Huiming. She assassinates Prince Dodo to avenge her father, but is captured and imprisoned. She becomes Zhang Huazhao's love interest and marries him eventually. * Chu Zhaonan () is Reverend Huiming's second apprentice, who inherited the Soaring Dragon Sword (游龍劍) from his master. He succumbs to temptations of fame and glory, and becomes a servant of Wu Sangui. He betrays Wu later and defects to serve the Kangxi Emperor, who appoints him as an imperial guard commander. He is defeated by Yilan Zhu in the final battle in the Tibetan labyrinth and sustains serious injuries, including the loss of his left arm. He chooses to commit suicide to avoid humiliation. * Yang Yuncong () is Reverend Huiming's first apprentice, who inherited the Jade Breaking Sword (斷玉劍) from his master. He has a secret affair with Nalan Minghui, who bore him a daughter. However, he cannot be together with Nalan as she is forced to marry Prince Dodo.

He meets Mao Wanlian and Fu Qingzhu, who help to cure him of his mental illness and reunite him with his family. He falls in love with Mao Wanlian and becomes extremely protective of her. Despite his formidable prowess in swordplay and anqi, he is reckless, nonchalant, easily agitated, and bereft of social etiquette. He becomes the founder of the northern branch of the Wudang Sect. * Gui Tianlan () is Ye Yunsun's eldest apprentice. He brings Shi Tiancheng's family with him to join Zhang Xianzhong's forces, and settles at Jiange after Sichuan falls to Qing forces. Believing that Shi Tiancheng had died, he marries Shi's wife and adopts Shi's children. He is killed in a fight against Shi Tiancheng and four imperial guards. * Shi Daniang () is Ye Yunsun's daughter. She marries Shi Tiancheng and bears him Zhongming and Zhujun. After her husband's apparent death, she marries Gui Tianlan, who helps to take care of her and her children.

She settles on Mount Heaven with her children after her husband's death. Wudang Sect * Xin Longzi () is Zhuo Yihang's first apprentice. Even though he started learning from Zhuo before Shi Tiancheng, he is younger than Shi, so his master wanted him to address Shi as his senior. While in Tibet, he once saw Han Zhibang practising martial arts from the Yijin Jing, and immediately realised that the manual contained the missing moves to his master's 'Bodhidharma Swordplay' (達摩劍法). He seizes the manual from Han through trickery and masters the skills in it, becoming even more powerful than before. He desires to have a precious sword of his own and is tricked by Chu Zhaonan into helping the villains. Chu attempts to kill him to seize the Yijin Jing but he is saved by Ling Weifeng and survives. He is turned back to the path of goodness by Ling and decides to follow his benefactor.

He is accepted by Zhuo Yihang as an apprentice, despite already having a background in other forms of martial arts. He returns to confront Gui Tianlan later and causes the latter to die. He regrets upon learning the truth from his wife after Gui's death. He promises that the firstborn child of his son shall bear Gui's family name, as a form of \\"compensation\\" to his late senior. He helps Xin Longzi in the fight against Qi Zhenjun, managing to inflict severe wounds on Qi. However, he is also mortally wounded and dies from his injuries later. * Zhuo Yihang () is Lian Nichang's lover and was Wudang's leader in Baifa Monü Zhuan. He is already dead when the events in Qijian Xia Tianshan take place. He finally obtained the flowers that can turn his lover's white hair black again, but did not live to pass them to her personally. Before his death, he told Xin Longzi to use chemical means to reduce the size of his body in order to prevent his enemies from identifying and destroying his remains. His shrunken skeleton is last seen lying beside Lian Nichang's dead body. * Xuanzhen () is Taoist Huangye's apprentice and the current leader of Wudang. He encounters Wu Qiongyao and duels with her when she teases him about his skills. He is unable to defeat Wu and feels angry and ashamed.

He finds the Yijin Jing and masters an incomplete set of the skills, which temporarily boosts his prowess in martial arts. He helps the Tibetan lamas retrieve the stolen śarīras and earns their respect in return. He uses his close relations with the Tibetans to help the rebels on a few occasions. He encounters a dying Xin Longzi later and obliges to Xin's final request to join the Wudang Sect. He takes back the Yijin Jing and passes his knowledge of the 'Bodhidharma Swordplay' to Gui Zhongming later. He willingly sacrifices himself to save Ling Weifeng by secretly switching places with Ling when the latter is imprisoned in a Tibetan labyrinth. He attempts to ambush Chu Zhaonan when the latter comes to check on Ling, but is no match for Chu and is slain by Chu. * Yang Yiwei () * Hua Zishan () =Southern Ming rebels= * Liu Yufang (), nicknamed \\"Brocade Cloud Sword\\" (雲錦劍), is Liu Jingyi's daughter.

Thomas and directed by debutant Thomson K. Thomas. It stars Dileep, Akhila, Vandana Menon, Madhu, and Suraj Venjaramoodu. It was Dileep's 100th film. Akhila, a noted television anchor and dancer, debuted as an actress through this film. The film is an unofficial remake of Telugu film Kalisundam Raa with minor changes in the plot. Plot The story is set in a picturesque landscape in a village called \\"Krishnapuram\\". The two tharavadus (parentages) named Puthezhathu and Kizhakkedathu are situated in the same compound, and their members share a very great bonding with each other. The film begins with the celebration of Onam festival by the inmates of both the houses. Kizhakkedathu tharavadu's karanavar Krishna Warrier (Madhu)'s eldest son Rajan (Siddique) is in love with one of the girls there but his marriage is fixed with Saraswathy (Lena), daughter of Sankaran Nair (G. K. Pillai), the karanavar of Puthezhath family. Rajan and the girl elopes, and Saraswathy is later found dead in a quarry, apparently a suicide. Puthezhathu family believes that Kizhakkedathu family has cheated them, and thus they beat up Rajan, but Krishna Warrier comes to rescue him and also pulls him up on to the train, saying that he should never return. As years pass, Krishnanunni (Dileep), the hero of the story, is born to Rajan. Rajan, along with his wife and children, now lives in Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. He is now indulged in agriculture. He is assisted by his son Krishnanunni. During a clash in the market, the local thief Kalidas (Salim Kumar) is beaten by Krishnanunni/Kuttan and his friend Vadivelu/Pottan (Suraj Venjaramoodu), and is sacked and taken back in a bullock cart. Unfortunately, Kalidas escapes from the sack by jumping into a canal. When Unni and Vadivelu come to know about this, they tell their gang to beat him. Unfortunately, the sack was changed, and it was Ayyappan Nair (Kochu Preman), the former Karyasthan of Kizhakkedathu family, who was under it. Ayyappan Nair tells Rajan about the impact caused by his elope and Saraswathy's death on the two families. Both are now sworn enemies, and they have built up walls around their homes. There also happened a lawsuit between them, in which Kizhakkedathu family failed. It was the members of Puthezhathu family who beat Ayyappan Nair because he supported Kizhakkedathu and sacked him to Tenkasi. Unni then tells Rajan that he would go to pacify the two quarrelling families. Then, Unni and Vadivelu reach Krishnapuram, but suddenly they find Kalidas at Kizhakkedathu tharavadu and is shocked to hear that he has been appointed as the karyasthan of Kizhakkedathu tharavadu. Kalidas has a plan to steal an idol of Lord Krishna from Kizhakkedathu tharavadu, and he traps Unni and Vadivelu by handing the idol to them. Krishna Warrier later comes and unknowing that Unni is his grandson, calls his workers and beat Unni and Vadivelu. Later, they reach Puthezhathu tharavadu and get job as karyasthan (manager) and watchman respectively. The plan is approved by Sankaran Nair soon, and Kumaran (Harisree Ashokan), the former karyasthan, is declassified as an out-worker. Unni later tries to solve conflicts between the two families. It is during this time that the female lead, Sreebala (Akhila Sasidharan) enters. Vadivelu first flirts with her, but after hearing that she is also a member of Puthezhath family, he allows her to enter the home. Unni also interferes in Sreebala's college dance, changing the tune of her dance song. She later dances for the same tune. On the same day, she is harassed by Anand (Nishanth Sagar), the son of Kizhakkedathu Sreedharan (Ramu), a businessman. Krishnanunni saves her, but lies that it was Anand's father who saved her. Later, the stolen idol of Lord Krishna is found in a gravel, near the paddy fields of both families. Soon Krishnanunni begins his mission to unite the two families, his mission becomes a great success and it soon culminates in a marriage proposal between Anandh and Sreedevi (Vandana Menon), the sister ot Sreebala, but Sreedevi confess to Krishnanunni that she is in love with a serial actor named Aby George, who is a Christian, and would end her life is she is forced into marrying Anand. Krishnanunni and Sreebala helps Sreedevi to elope with her boyfriend which creates further trouble in the family, and after knowing that Krishnanunni is Rajan's son, the Puthezhathu and Kizhakeddathu families break ties once again, but this time, Kizhakedathu family support Krishnanunni and welcomes Rajan back home. The rift between the families is cleared when Krishnanunni finds out that Rajan's old friend Susheelan (Suresh Krishna) and his driver Gopalan (Shammi Thilakan) were responsible for Saraswathi's death, and it was a planned murder. Both the families unite once again for killing Susheelan and Sreebala and Krishnanunni get married.

The heartland, when referring to a cultural region of the United States, is the central land area of the U.S., usually the Midwestern United States or the states that don't border the Atlantic or Pacific oceans, associated with mainstream or traditional values, such as economic self-sufficiency, conservative political and religious ideals, and rootedness in agrarian life. US Census Bureau defines the Midwest as the 12 states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio. Other states that have no oceanic boundaries include the Mountain states (e.g. Montana, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming), and the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Arkansas.  Location  A church in South Dakota There is no consensus as to the geography of America's heartland. However, the American Midwest is the most commonly cited area as being the nation's heartland, although many other places have been referred to as part of it, often extending to rural or farming regions in the great plains. At least as early as 2010, the term Heartland has been used to refer to many so-called \\"red states\\", including those in the Bible belt.Boyer, Paul S., Clifford E. Clark, Karen Halttunen, Joseph F. Kett, and Neal Salisbury. The enduring vision: A history of the American people Volume II: Since 1865. Cengage Learning, 2016. According to the United States Census Bureau, the mean center of population in the U.S. in 2010 was in or around Texas County, Missouri. In 2000 it had been northeast from there, in Phelps County, Missouri. It is projected for the mean center of population to leave the Midwest and enter the Western U.S. by the middle of the 21st century. The geographic center of the 48 contiguous U.S. states is near Lebanon, Kansas. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union in 1959, the geographic center of the United States moved from Smith County, Kansas to Butte County, South Dakota.  Use of the term  Corn field in Iowa. Halford Mackinder, a British geographer, coined the word in 1904 to refer to the heart of the Eurasian land mass: a strategic center of industry, natural resources and power. The use of the term \\"heartland\\" to apply to the American Midwest did not become common until sometime later in the 20th century.Imagined Heartland, Frontier to Heartland, Newberry Library (2009), Retrieved 4 February 2015The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia, pp. 71-73 (2006)  Culture  Heartland rock musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger (Michigan), Melissa Etheridge (Kansas), John Mellencamp (Indiana), and Tom Petty have sung about heartland values. Heartland rock albums include Springsteen's Nebraska. The genre is not necessarily Midwestern, as Springsteen was born in New Jersey, and Petty was born in Florida and has sung about the Southern United States, such as in his album Southern Accents.

Often there will be a summit register (Gipfelbuch) at the cross, either in a container or at least a weatherproof case. Various other forms of marking or symbol such as cairns, prayer flags or ovoos may be found around the world on passes and hills, in particular on sacred mountains. In the Italian Alps a Madonna is sometimes placed at the summit instead of a cross. Summit crosses are normally about two to four metres high and are usually made of wood or metal. In April 2010 the world's first glass summit cross was erected on the Schartwand (2,339 m) in Salzburg's Tennengebirge mountains. Summit crosses are mainly found in Catholic regions of the Alps, especially in Austria, Switzerland and Bavaria, mountainous regions of Poland, but also in America. They usually stand on mountains whose summits are above the tree line, but they are also found in the German Central Uplands, for example in the Black Forest on the Herzogenhorn.  History  By the end of the 13th century a few large crosses had been erected in passes and on hills. Examples from this period include the Confin Cross in St. Valentin on the Mals Heath, which also acted as a boundary marker, or crosses on the Arlberg, the Gardena Pass or Birnlücke. An early example of a large cross, visible from the valley floor, being set up on a mountain top, occurred during the first successful climb of Mont Aiguille in 1492, when three crosses were put up at the corner of the summit plateau. In the 16th century crosses were erected with increasing frequency on mountain peaks, especially for the purpose of marking alpine pasture and municipal boundaries. In the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War, these religious symbols gained importance. The crosses of this period were mostly simple wooden ones hewn from branches found near the site, or house crucifixes. During this time crosses were often made with two cross beams in the form of so-called patriarchal crosses (or Scheyern crosses). These \\"weather crosses\\" were intended to supersede the old pagan superstitions associated with thunder, storm and hail. Further layers of Christian imagery as perceived by the Romantic generation made summit crosses a motif favoured by the painter Caspar David Friedrich in more than one of his mystic landscapes.Friedrich's Morning Mist in the Mountains and his Cross in the Mountains (the Tetschen Altarpiece) are noted by Norbert Wolf, Caspar David Friedrich: 1774-1840 : the painter of stillness 2003:22f. During the 19th century the summits of many mountains were adorned with what were usually simple, wooden crosses during the course of mountaineering expeditions or survey work, both of which were on the increase. Large summit crosses in the modern sense — that is pieces designed specifically for mountain tops by expert craftsmen — were not really introduced until the end of the 19th century. One known exception is that of the Kleinglockner and Grossglockner, which were given large summit crosses in 1799 and 1800 as part of their first ascent. These crosses, in addition to their religious function, were also used, for example, as lightning conductors, and fitted with meteorological instruments such as barometers. During the 19th century there were several attempts to erect secular symbols such as pyramids, obelisks or flags instead of crosses, usually dedicated to secular rulers. One example was the construction of the so-called Emperor Obelisk on the Ortler in 1888. The 20th century introduced modern materials and technology: a summit cross erected in 1977 on Carrauntoohil, the highest summit in Ireland, originally featured a windmill that powered light bulbs on the cross.Helen Fairbairn and Gareth McCormack, Lonely Planet Hiking in Ireland, 2010:110. What summit crosses may express can be exemplified by the crosses erected and re-erected on the comparatively insignificant Butte de Warlencourt, a pre-Christian tumulus on the Somme, only some 20m above the surrounding terrain but a scene of intense fighting during World War I, when it was the objective of costly and fruitless British attacks during the battle of the Somme: \\"this pagan memorial was Christianized by bombardment and large numbers of dead,\\" and claimed with first a British cross (1917), then a German one (1918), the latter being removed during the interwar period and replaced by soldiers of the Wehrmacht, in \\"a symbolic conflict of ownership fought with cruciform images.\\"Nicholas J. Saunder, \\"Crucifix, Calvary, and Cross: Materiality and Spirituality in Great War Landscapes\\", World Archaeology 35.1, The Social Commemoration of Warfare (June, 2003:7-21), p. 12. The erection of summit crosses experienced a boom in the early 20th century. After the First World War and even after the Second World War, many new crosses were erected. Communities often organized this sometimes very expensive and logistically difficult task on very high mountain peaks in the memory of the fallen, and war veterans in particular were often involved in their installation. A superlative example is the Heroes' Cross on Caraiman Peak, in the Bucegi mountains of Romania at an altitude of 2291m — the largest construction of this sort in the world (as recognized in 2013 by the Guinness World Records). Built between 1926 and 1928 to honor the fallen heroes of the First World War, great efforts were put into its construction, the location being so high and so remote. Marie of Edinburgh, Queen of Romania, and King Ferdinand of Romania initiated and supervised its construction, supported by war veterans' associations, local businesses and many local volunteers. The Cross is 36m high, with its horizontal arms spanning 14m; it has many light bulbs covering its entire face on the Prahova Valley side, and at commissioning it had an electrical generator in its base and its light could be seen from a great distance. Nowadays it is connected to the electrical grid. Under the Communist regime, it was endangered by plans to transform it into a totally different symbol, by removing the horizontal arms and adding a red star on top. Another famous example from this period is the cross at the Zuckerhütl, whose construction in 1947 was dramatized on film a year later. Today summit crosses are often put up by the local tourist association or branch of the Alpine Club.

In this range it can be found in most soil types, from coastal sand to rocky mountain slopes and clay. Description Candlewood tree in cultivation, Pretoria. In the wild it often grows as a stunted bush (especially in exposed positions). However if permitted to by favourable conditions, it can grow into a tree of up to 10 meters in height. The masses of sweetly scented flowers are followed by large numbers of very distinctive and attractive bright-orange, lantern-shaped berries. The young leaves are red, but mature to a glossy green colour. Cultivation In cultivation the candlewood can be pruned to form a proper shade tree. However, it can also be allowed to grow as a bushy screen, if its lower branches are not removed. This plant grows particularly well in coastal conditions (although it can also be found inland). Its primary reason for cultivation are as a coastal hedge, and for its ornamental bright orange, lantern-shaped berries, which attract birds.

Dickerson (1891–1986) was a prominent African American attorney, community activist and business executive who successfully argued before the U. S. Supreme Court in Hansberry v. Lee. Early life Earl Burrus Dickerson was born on June 22, 1891, in Canton, Mississippi, the son of Edward and Emma Garrett Fielding Dickerson. His maternal grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Garrett Sr., was born a slave and purchased himself and his wife, Eliza Montgomery, out of slavery prior to the end of the Civil War. Earl's father died in 1896 and Earl was raised by his mother, his maternal grandmother, Eliza, and a half-sister from his father's first marriage, Gertrude.Dingwall, Christopher; Rachel Watson \\" Guide to the Earl B. Dickerson Papers\\", Chicago Public Library, Mapping the Stacks. Retrieved September 3, 2011. Dickerson first moved to Chicago in 1907 and spent most of the next 10 years there, graduating from a University of Chicago-sponsored prep school in 1909. He earned a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Illinois in 1914. During his time spent studying at the University of Illinois, Dickerson helped establish the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and served as the chapter's first president. . Following the completion of his college credits, but prior to receiving his degree, Dickerson taught English, debate, and mathematics at the Tuskegee Institute for the 1913-14 school year. In the fall of 1915, Dickerson began attending the University of Chicago Law School. At the end of his second year of law school, Dickerson's legal studies were interrupted by World War I. Dickerson enlisted in the U. S. Army and attended officer's training school at Fort Des Moines. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1917. Dickerson was stationed at Camp Grant and assigned to Company E, Second Battalion, 365th Infantry Regiment, Ninety-second Division. He served in France as a member of the American Expeditionary Forces. After the conclusion of the war, Dickerson became the only black founding member of the American Legion and personally organized the George L. Giles Post 87 in Chicago. Returning to the University of Chicago, Dickerson completed his legal studies in 1920, becoming one of the first African Americans to graduate from the Law School. The University of Chicago Black Law Students Association is named in his honor.http://uchicagoblsa.weebly.com/history.html In the fall of 1917, Dickerson was commissioned as a second lieutenant Law career In 1921, Dickerson accepted a position as general counsel of the newly formed Liberty Life Insurance Company of Illinois (later Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Company), which later became the largest African American owned insurance company in the North. This was not Dickerson's first association with the company. In 1919, while still a law student, he had helped draft the company's articles of incorporation. Dickerson considered his work with Supreme Liberty Life Insurance to be his most outstanding contribution to American society. While working for Supreme Liberty Life Insurance, Dickerson opened a law office and shared office space with fellow University of Chicago Law graduate Wendell E. Green, who later became a Circuit Court judge. In 1923, Dickerson joined a partnership with Edward H. Morris and James B. Cashin to form Morris, Cashin, and Dickerson. Concurrent with this partnership, Dickerson served as an assistant corporation counsel for the city of Chicago. In 1927, Dickerson was instrumental in establishing Burr Oak Cemetery, one of the few African American cemeteries in southwestern Cook County. Later, during the Great Depression, Dickerson helped persuade Supreme Liberty Life Insurance to step in and save the cemetery after Burr Oak defaulted on its mortgage.Blakely, Robert J.; Marcus Shepard (2006) Earl B. Dickerson: A Voice for Freedom and Equality. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press 2006, pp. 54–56. Dickerson was known as \\"the dean of Chicago’s Black lawyers,\\" and in 1933 became the first African American appointed as Illinois Assistant Attorney General under Governor Henry Horner. Dickerson served in that role until 1939.Jack Salzman, David Lionel Smith, Cornel West; Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History, 1996, pp.175 Famously, Dickerson successfully argued before the U. S. Supreme Court in the landmark Hansberry v. Lee case. Hansberry involved a Chicago home purchased by real estate broker Carl Augustus Hansberry in a neighborhood with a racially restrictive covenant. Racially restrictive covenants were used to restrict black residents from living in certain neighborhoods (in turn creating a Black Belt of crowded, dilapidated, and under-resourced neighborhoods for black residents). Hansberry purchased a house in Woodlawn, which was under a racially restrictive covenant, with money borrowed from the Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Company. Hansberry served on the board of the Chicago NAACP with Dickerson and was the father of playwright Lorraine Hansberry. The events giving rise to Hansberry v. Lee inspired Lorraine Hansberry’s play A Raisin in the Sun. Dickerson determined that there was a better chance to win the case based on a procedural issue surrounding class suits rather than argue the constitutionality of racially restrictive covenants. The decision in Hansberry v. Lee ended a racially restrictive covenant on the South Side of Chicago and paved the way for the Supreme Court to declare to racially restrictive covenants unconstitutional in Shelley v.

The first section of the line between Bützow and Güstrow was opened in 1850 by the Mecklenburg Railway Company () and is one of the oldest railways in Germany and is part of the Leipzig–Magdeburg–Schwerin–Rostock main line. History  =Route and construction = In 1850, the Mecklenburg Railway Company, opened the line between Bützow and Güstrow, as a branch line of the Bad Kleinen–Rostock line built by the same company. An extension to the east was proposed to connect to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. As there were few wealthy investors, the Güstrow–Neubrandenburg line was built by the government of Mecklenburg- Schwerin at the initiative of Grand Duke Frederick Francis (Friedrich-Franz) II. The line was formally opened on 11 November 1864 at Teterow station in the presence of the two grand dukes, Frederick Francis and Frederick William of Mecklenburg. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway (Großherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz-Eisenbahn) was founded to operate the line, which later took over other lines in the country as well. The original headquarters of the company was in Malchin.Schultz, 1992. Facade of Szczecin Główny station In 1866/67, the line was extended from Neubrandenburg to Strasburg (Uckermark) on the Prussian border. At the same time the line was extended on the Prussian side from Pasewalk. There, the line connected with the Angermünde–Anklam line and the line between Szczecin (then Stettin) and Pasewalk that had already been opened on 16 March 1863 by the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company (Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). =1875–1945 = The Friedrich-Franz Railway was privatised in 1875 and re- nationalised in 1890, until finally after the First World War it was integrated into the German State Railways. The section from the border at Strasburg to Stettin was absorbed by the Prussian State Railways as part of the nationalisation of the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company in 1880. In 1890 the construction of the Bützow–Güstrow Canal required the line to be moved to the north in Bützow. At the same time the route of the line to Bützow station was changed with the connection to the Rostock–Bad Kleinen line being moved to face to the south rather than the north. This allowed trains to run directly from Bad Kleinen without changing direction. The bridge over the Nebel river on the old route is preserved in Bützow. In 1905, about five to seven pairs of trains ran on the line each day, including a fast passenger trains and a stopping train between Hamburg and Stettin, and a train ran between Hamburg and Neubrandenburg. At the boundary in Strasburg, trains continued after a brief stop. After World War I, the Friedrich-Franz Railway and the Prussian State Railways were taken over by the German State Railways. Strasburg was on the border of lines controlled by railway divisions in Schwerin and Stettin. Services changed little following nationalisation. A continuous D-express and an ordinary express ran to Hamburg, and four pairs of ordinary trains ran to Stettin (and five between Bützow and Güstrow), with one of them also running all the way from Hamburg to Stettin. There were additional trains on parts of the route. Between Pasewalk and Szczecin service levels were much denser. Briefly trains stopped in Remplin (only for two excursion trains on Sundays) and Nienhagen (introduced in early 1940s). After the Second World War both stations disappeared from the train schedules. =1945–1990 = After the Second World War most of the route was in East Germany and became part of the East German railways. The section from the border at Grambow to Szczecin became part of Polish State Railways (PKP). The former continuous line between Hamburg and Szczecin was disrupted by the border with Poland and the Inner German border. The second track, which existed west of Teterow, was dismantled after the war, making it a single-track line, as it still is. Because of the dismantling of the Lloyd Railway between Neustrelitz and Plaaz for reparations to the Soviet Union trains between Berlin and Rostock ran from 1945 to 1961 via Güstrow and Neubrandenburg. In the first years after the war, there was little travel to Poland. Between 1950 and 1952 there was a continuous through coach connection between Berlin and Szczecin via Pasewalk.Kuhlmann, 2004. After that the route across the border was for a long time only used for freight. Passenger services were only resumed in May 1972, following the introduction of visa-free travel between East Germany and Poland. =Since 1990 = Pasewalk station In 1991, passenger services to Poland were resumed. As a result, three to four pairs of trains ran to Szczecin, the rest ended in Grambow. In 2001 services to Szczecin were increased to a frequency of every two hours. Services have gradually increased on the Bützow–Pasewalk section. In 1995 Regional-Express trains (stopping in Güstrow, Teterow, Malchin, Stavenhagen, Neubrandenburg and Strasburg) ran approximately every two-hour and took about 130 minutes to run and were followed by Regionalbahn trains, stopping at all stations. In 1996 the timetable was changed. Some minor stations were closed. Since then, Regional-Express trains have run every hour, stopping at almost all the remaining stations. Since 1998, trains of DB Regio and a private operator, Ostmecklenburgische Eisenbahn (now Ostseeland-Verkehr) run alternately every two hours, so that overall there is an approximate hourly service between Bützow and Pasewalk. Since 2002, trains from Szczecin again run on the whole route to Bützow. They originally ran to Hagenow, but since 2006 to Lübeck. This is the first time since the war again that through trains have run between Lübeck to Szczecin. The cruising speed is poor, however, due to the many stops and the one-track line. Trains now take 150 minutes between Bützow and Pasewalk, much longer than in 1995. Between Lübeck and Szczecin, the journey takes four hours and 40 minutes; in the opposite direction it takes more than five hours.

Romer was born October 1, 1909 at Lackawaxen, Penn. Zane and Dolly Grey had three children: Romer, Betty, and Loren. Romer was named after an uncle Romer Carl Grey, known as Reddy Grey. In his youth Romer was very much \\"a chip off the old block.\\" He went on a number of his father's expeditions in to the wild areas and also on many of his fishing trips. Romer was very much into hunting, shooting, and fishing. See for example, Zane Grey's \\"Book of Camps and Trails\\" and Romer's own two fishing books listed below. It was Romer who suggested to his father the idea for the novel Western Union, and it was Romer who did much of the research that went into the book. In addition, it was Romer who wrote the so-called \\"Big Little Books,\\" although they bore his father's name. He also wrote stories for comic strip King of the Royal Mounted and the film serial King of the Mounties. He also developed the comic strip \\"Tex Thorne\\". The WWA dedicated the January, 1972 issue of The Roundup as a \\"Zane Grey Centennial Issue\\" and printed an article by Romer Grey about his dad's methods of research and writing.  Animation  Romer Zane Grey spent the year of 1930-31 pursuing the career of an animator. His would- be star character, Binko the Bear Cub, never came to fruition. Four films are generally reported as having been in production: * Arabian Nightmare * Hot-Toe Mollie * Sand Witches * Binko the Toreador Many years later, a discovery in a basement yielded the remnants of the Grey animation studio; one that hired many \\"A-list\\" animators at the time from the studios of Disney and Looney Tunes. Despite many sketches, cels, and drawings in the basement find, there was not a foot of film that was intact. Records indicated that Arabian Nightmare and Hot-Toe Mollie were, however, ready to be filmed before the studio shut down. In 2013, a 35mm print of Hot-Toe Mollie surfaced elsewhere, showing that at least one short made it to film.  Later life  Romer married his first wife Dorothy Olson of Glendale, CA, when she was aged nineteen years, in 1930. They had one child but divorced a few years later. He had three subsequent marriages. Romer Zane Grey was a pilot in the Pacific during World War II, and was president of Zane Grey, Inc., a business which he operated out of his home on El Nido St. in Pasadena, Calif. He was the author of two books on fishing (his father's favourite sport), and he wrote numerous short stories and articles. His article, \\"From Purple Ink to Purple Sage,\\" was a highlight of a special \\"Zane Grey Centennial Issue\\" of The Roundup in January, 1972. An article in the September, 1976 issue of The Roundup relates the findings of a story in the Pasadena News that Romer Grey was a virtual recluse and that he always found it hard to live in the shadow of his famous father. Despite his father’s life-long aversion to alcohol, Romer became an alcoholic as was a brother of Zane’s; (Ellsworth Grey.) Even after Romer's death, the family declined to release pictures of him. Romer Zane Grey suffered a stroke on February 23 and was admitted to the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, Calif., where he died on March 8, 1976, at the age of 65 leaving behind his third and last Wife Octave B. Grey, his son Romer Grey Jr and five grandchildren. Also survived by a younger brother, Loren Grey, a professor of psychology at Valley State College in California; and by a sister, Betty Zane Grosso.

It is a CO2 reduction concept developed by the German renewable energy institute IWR. The CERINA Plan proposes a technical investment approach linking a country’s CO2 emissions to its investment in renewable energy technology. Therefore, it is an alternative model to approaches like the Kyoto idea of mere cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The model is meant to be flexible and to adapt to the special national circumstances of each country.  Background  In 2009, all countries of the world emitted collectively 31.1 billion tons of CO2.BMWi: “Energiedaten - ausgewählte Grafiken”, chart 12, p.21 http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/E/energiestatistiken- grafiken,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf Retrieved 2010-10-29. This was 37 per cent more than in 1990, the Kyoto reference year.Reuters: “World '09 CO2 emissions off 1.3 pct – institute” http://in.reuters.com/article/idINLDE67C0R020100813 Retrieved 2010-10-29. Whereas the Kyoto-model only considers the limitation of emissions,Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/1678.php Retrieved 2010-10-29. the CERINA concept allows countries to choose if they prefer to cut emissions or to increase renewable investment. Based on this idea of economic incentives, the CERINA plan is meant to help stabilizing global emissions.  Principle of the model  In general, the principle of the CERINA-Plan is: The more a country emits, the more it has to invest in counterbalancing renewable energy technology. Since the annual global CO2 growth rate and the investments in renewable energy generation plants concerning power, heating and fuels are known, the necessary amount which have to be spent for renewable can be calculated. According to IWR calculations, the global amount should be increased to 500 billion Euro per year from 125 billion Euro of actual investment in 2009. Together with the figure of 31.1 billion tons of CO2 emissions, this leads to a theoretical price of 16 Euro per ton [3]. With the help of this calculation, the required investment sum can be determined for each country. For example, the world’s largest emitter China would have to spend an amount of 119 billion Euro to compensate for its 7.4 billion tons of emitted CO2.IWR press release: “Economic crisis slows worldwide CO2 emissions” http://www.renewable-energy-industry.com/press- releases/press-releases_detail.php?changeLang=en_GB&newsid;=3497 Retrieved 2010-10-22.

Perspectives  Alone or combined with other methods, the CERINA concept is supposed to increase the industrial and political acceptance of climate protection goals. In the long term, it is planned by the IWR institute to establish a global renewable energy investment ranking according to the real investments in renewable energy by the countries.

Sughd FEZ is located on the Southwest Industrial Area of Khujand with a total area of 320 hectares. Geological and geodetic surveys were made in this area as well as the design work was carried out. In this part of the city there is a possibility to expand the territory of Sughd FEZ for up to 2,000 hectares of land at the expense of free space in the future. Choosing a location Sughd FEZ was due to the presence of the industrial and communications infrastructure in this area relatively close proximity of residential areas of Khujand city, the presence of new bridge over Syr-Darya River, and construction of a branch railway to Sughd FEZ in the future. 265x265px One of the most important criteria in choosing a site to start a business is the geographical location. Sughd FEZ provides with a favorable site for export-oriented enterprises. Developed transport network system of Khujand provides with a wide range of opportunities for export and trade with near- and far abroad countries.  Transport and logistic  * The distance to the border with Uzbekistan is 70 km and to Kyrgyzstan - 15 km. * New international transit highway “Dushanbe- Khujand-Chanak” runs directly near the main entrance of Sughd Free Economic Zone. * The nearest railway station and the international airport of “Khujand” are located in a distance of 18 kilometers from Sughd FEZ. * Nowadays the project of construction of the railway line Sughd FEZ station – “Spitamen” station with total length of 22 km is developed.

Those changes, led by the post-communist oligarchy, caused an increasing number of impoverished and homeless people in Ukraine during 1990s. The crime rate and the prison population grew until 2001. Changes in penal policy of the Ukrainian government started after the pontifical visit of Pope John Paul II to Ukraine. In 2010–2011 the number of remand prisoners increased sharply up to 45,000. Beginning in July 2012, the prison population fell from 154,000 to 79,750 before 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. As a matter of fact, the Donbas has 20% of all prisons functioning in Ukraine. As a heritage of the Soviet period, Donetsk and Lugansk regions have 20 and 16 prison facilities respectively, twice more than any other region in Ukraine. Convicts were released without any government programs for rehabilitation, destabilizing these regions. During the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, hundreds of convicts from prisons in Donbas were armed by the pro-Russian militants. Other prisoners have been used as slave labourers. Prison reform in Ukraine goes on. Prison system of Ukraine The symbol of the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine \\"The State has the twofold responsibility about crime and punishment: to discourage behavior that is harmful to human rights and the fundamental norms of civil life, and to repair, through the penal system, the disorder created by criminal activity. Judicial and penal institutions play a fundamental role in protecting citizens and safeguarding the common good. By their very nature these institutions must contribute to the rehabilitation of offenders.\\"Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace Published by Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB), Ottawa, 2005, , Softcover, pp. 446 The legal bases of the organization and activity of the Prison System of Ukraine are determined by the law «On the State Criminal-executive Service of Ukraine» (July 20, 2005). It sets, in particular, the organizational structure of this service, which consists of three levels: central (central body of the executive authority on implementation of punishments and probation, this is the State Criminal- executive Service of Ukraine under leadership of Ministry of Justice of Ukraine), regional (6 territorial bodies of management), local (penitentiary facilities, pre-trial prisons (so called investigation isolators) and units of Probation). Concentration of prison facilities in regions of Ukraine is different. 29 prisons occurred on the occupied territory of Donbas. The country's prison system was the responsibility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs until 1998, when it was placed under the newly created State Penal Department. In December 2010 it was reorganized as the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine, which is directed by the Ministry of Justice. It is responsible for the execution of criminal sentences within the Ukrainian prison system. There are 177 penal institutions in Ukraine (for January 1, 2015 - 31 pre-trial detention prisons, 139 penal facilities of different levels of security, six corrective penal settlements for minors). On 1 January 2015, the prison population numbered 73,431 people (162 prisoners per 100,000 people, down from 347 per 100,000 people in July 2011). Approximately one- sixth are remanded prisoners. The Department of Criminal Executive Inspection has 87,581 convicts who are sentenced to criminal punishments alternative to imprisonment. In February 2000, Ukraine abolished the death penalty, which had been abandoned since March 1997. 1,906 inmates are sentenced to life imprisonment. Development of the State Probation Service has begun. The Criminal Executive Service of Ukraine lost control of four Crimean prisons in March 2014 when Russia occupied and annexed Crimea. The functioning of 29 prisons in militant-controlled areas of Donbass deteriorated after the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, with lack of food and drinking water affecting 16,200 inmates. In October 2014, insurgents agreed on a green corridor for the evacuation of women from a destroyed prison in the Lugansk region. On 18 May, 2016, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine abolished the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine and has taken responsibility for national prison system in Ukraine. Prison Ministry of the Ukrainian Greek- Catholic Church The Chortkiv Remand Prison Chapel of St. John. Ukraine 2008. Rembrandt's painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son (c. 1662). Penitentiary pastoral ministry of the UGCC is a Catholic Prison Ministry in Ukraine founded on international principles of religious assistance in prisons praised during the 12th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. On June 8, 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a law about chaplaincy in prisons #419-VIII \\"On Amendments to Several Legislative Acts of Ukraine (regarding activity of chaplains in the bodies and institutions belonging to the jurisdiction of the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine). Prison chaplaincy is now experiencing the time of revival after the long period of atheism. Prison pastoral care was at the very heart of spirituality of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church throughout her history. Now we cannot imagine any prison without presence of a chaplain. It was a merit of former heads of the State Penal Department of Ukraine Volodymyr Liovochkin, Ivan Shtanko and Vasyliy Koschinets. They opened the gates of any prison for church pastors. The workers of the Social, Educational and Psychological Service of the prison system of Ukraine were the main link assisting establishment of prison chaplaincy step by step. Prison Pastoral of the UGCC, though it is still very young, is taking successive steps to integrity. It was restored in 1990 after the Church, formerly forbidden, emerged from the underground. Pastoral care has grown steadily from several prison facilities in the Western Part of Ukraine to more than 40 penal institutions in every region of the country. The most active prison chaplains are the Redemptorist Fathers. Since 2001 the UGCC is the co-founder of the Ukrainian Interdenominational Christian Mission \\"Spiritual and Charitable Care in Prisons\\" including twelve Churches and Denominations. This Mission is a part of the World Association of Prison Ministry. Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has defined the Sunday of the Prodigal Son, which every year falls up to date two weeks before the Great Lent, as a Day of special attention to prison ministry. The Gospel Reading on this Sunday (Luke 15:11-32) lays out one of the most important themes of the Lenten season: the history of falling into a sin, realization of one's sinfulness, the road to repentance, and finally reconciliation, each of which is illustrated in the course of the parable. The UGCC Synod invokes to remember in prayers workers of the Penitentiary system of Ukraine, who perform difficult tasks, because every day they are near of broken human destinies. This Sunday declared as a day to remember in prayers and support chaplains and volunteers, who work with great dedication to provide spiritual support for prisoners, helping them to step on the right path. =Structure= Logo of the UGCC Penitentiary Pastoral Care The Patriarchal Curia of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church is an organ of Sviatoslav Shevchuk, Major Archbishop of Kyiv and Halych, which coordinates and promotes the common activity of the Church's structures, enables relations and cooperation with other Churches and major public institutions in religious and social areas to practice ecumenical cooperation and Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church in everyday life. Auxiliary bishop Bohdan Dzyurach is the head of the Patriarchal administration. In the year 2006 Lubomyr Husar, former Head of the UGCC, established in the Patriarchal Curia of the UGCC the Department for Pastoral Care in the Armed Forces and in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine. This structure implements a general management of Prison Ministry. The chief of the Department is Michael Koltun, Bishop of Sokal and Zhovkva. The head of the Office for Penitentiary Pastoral Care is Fr. Constantin Panteley, who is responsible for coordination of activity in this realm. He is in direct contact with 32 priests in 14 eparchies who have been assigned responsibility for prison pastoral care. Those pastors ensure regular attendance of penitentiary facilities, investigatory isolators and prisons. More than 1000 volunteers are plugged into different areas of the ministry and making Pastoral Care of inmates more abundant. They engaged to charitable actions, mailing support, evangelization, help to former inmates after their release etc. Chaplains of the UGCC - Ukraine - 2009 Department of the UGCC for Pastoral Care in the Armed Forces and in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine is provisory structure till both chaplaincies will be quite ripe. Prison Pastoral Care is appealed to facilitate transition from the punitive system neglecting human dignity to the social law enforcement service cherishing penitentiary idea. Our mission is to serve the inmates in the national penitentiaries with Christian charity and reconciliation through extensive ministry to the spiritual and physical needs of prisoners of any creed, sex, age, religious faith, or nationality. The priority directions of the ministry are sermon, catechetics, administration of the sacraments for inmates, assistance and support of communication with family, spiritual support of the prison stuff, engagement of lay people in ministry. The UGCC Prison Ministry has many directions of development in compatibility with other missions of the Church. It is currently carrying out on the base of \\"The Agreement for cooperation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church with the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine\\", which offers many possibilities. Today pastoral ministry is regularly carried out in penitentiary facilities # 14, 30, 34, 40, 41, 44, 46, 47, 48, 50, 55, 63, 85, 112, 128, 135 in seven remand prisons and in one juvenile correctional facility. The other 8 prisons our pastors are able to attend just irregularly. The number of prison chaplains has decreased in recent years. Considering the occupation of certain territories of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, care of prisoners was suspended in prisons # 3, 13, 120, 124. Two juvenile correctional facilities in Sambir and Berezhany as well as prisons # 110 and 118 were closed. Four prison chaplains became pastors for military forces. =Development= Chaplain Paul Manley blesses a pregnant inmate. The UGCC became an active member of The International Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care (ICCPPC) at the XIIth World Congress, held in Rome in September 2007. The ICCPPC is a worldwide Association of country delegates for Catholic Prison Pastoral Care, composed of clerical and lay persons. At this Congress the Church expressed concern about imprisoned held in inhumane conditions, especially minors, women, old and mentally ill persons and those people who only came on trial and their guilt was not proven. For the first time in the history of Ukraine, a training program for prison chaplains of the UGCC called \\"Pastoral care at the penitentiary institutions of Ukraine\\" was held at the Professional College of the State Penal Department in Bila Tserkva town in November, 2007. On February - May, 2008 this common educational program was spread out for other Christian denominations. Since 2008 chaplains of the UGCC are in closer cooperation with catholic chaplains in Poland sharing experiences. On February, 2008 the UGCC presentated the Ukrainian publication of Compendium of the Catholic social teaching for the State Penal Department of Ukraine. On June, 2008 the UGCC and Penitentiary Service of Ukraine carried out the First Pilgrimage to Zarvanytsia, a sacred place of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The employees of the Central Administration of the Penal Department, chiefs of all Regional Management Units of the Penal System, chiefs and assistants of 183 prison facilities of Ukraine and clergy of different Churches took part in this pilgrimage. The total number of pilgrims was more than 350 persons. Pilgrimage was carried out with the intention to deepen the understanding of vocation to the prison service and to comprehend the Teaching of the Church about challenges concerning crime, sin, penance, pardon, change of life and cherishment of the human dignity. The UGCC invites the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine for an annual pilgrimage to the Saint Dormition Monastery of Univ (Lviv region). This pilgrimage for the workers of the prison system of Ukraine, named \\"Justice, Faith and Mercy!\\", is dedicated to the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (or Triumph of the Cross) on September, 26-27. The Ukrainian translation of the book Human Rights of Prisoners was issued on July, 2008. The English version of the book was published in 2006 in Rome under the aegis of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the International Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care(ICCPPC). The translation of \\"Human Rights of Prisoners\\" into Ukrainian was published on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, accepted and proclaimed on December 10, 1948, by the General Assembly of the UN. > \\"All of us are sinners, even though only a small percentage of us are > criminals. Crime is an indisputable fact of our reality. However, we do not > always understand and know how to treat it, how to treat criminals or how > criminals themselves should consider the state of their souls,\\" - so wrote > Patriarch Lubomyr in the introduction, - \\"Even if these people are justly > convicted because they made a big mistake, stepping on the wrong path, they > are facing sufferings. They need our help, in the words of Jesus Christ - > our compassion.\\" The International Conference \\"Area Juridica of Prison Ministry\\" took place in Kyiv on June 6, 2009, by the initiative of the ICCPPC-Europe. The Conference was organized in cooperation of the UGCC and the State Penal Department of Ukraine. Participants examined the status of legislation in European countries for the safeguarding of human dignity in prisons. The Conference analyzed status of criminal justice in Central and Eastern Europe, human rights of prisoners and convicts. Members of the working group of the ICCPPC-Europe invited for the Conference representatives of Churches ministering in prisons of Ukraine. Vice-president of PFI Soren Johnson and head chaplain of Russia Alexander Dobrodiejev participated in this event. Later on Dr. Christian Kuhn, President of the ICCPPC, who is well known human rights defender, represented position of the Catholic Pastoral Ministry about religious rights of prisoners at The Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, which took place in Salvador, Brazil, from 12–19 April 2010. In December 2009 the Commission of Kiev Archdiocese for penitentiary pastoral care was founded by decision of Lubomir Husar. The issues of the ministry in prison were as a subject of three sessions of the Synod of Bishops of the UGCC in 2010. The understanding and sensitivity of the Synod of Bishops of the UGCC concerning prison pastoral ministry is growing. The Sunday of the Prodigal Son has been appointed as a day of the Prison Pastoral Care. In summer of 2010 the registration of the 1-st Rehabilitation Center for women ex-prisoners started in Chernigiv suburb. The importance and value of pastoral care in penitentiary system is indisputable. Even if prison chaplaincy does not exist in Ukraine de jure, ministry of the Church in prison establishments of Ukraine became more possible de facto than we practically offer now! The number of well trained lay volunteers is not enough. Not all assigned pastors really respond to vocation for regular ministry in prison. Former Chief Representative of the ICCPPC-Europe Deacon Peter Echtermeyer did a lot for inspiration of Prison Pastoral. He traveled to Ukraine four times. The Board of the ICCPPC-Europe has gathered on January 2012 in Lviv (Western Ukraine) to analyze the development of the international cooperation in the region. Conference was headed by Msgr. Pawel Wojtas (Poland), vice-president of the ICCPPC and Fr. Marc Helfer (France), chief representative of the ICCPPC-Europe. In December 12, 2012 the Head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Patriarch Sviatoslav (Shevchuk) and Alexander Lisitskov, the Head of the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine (SPSU), Lieutenant-General of internal service, have signed an Agreement of cooperation. The Agreement is a reflection of cooperation according to the previous document signed by cardinal Lubomyr Husar in the year 2007. The text of the Agreement summarizes not only the structural changes that have occurred over the past 5 years, but also laid emphasis on pastoral care about staff of the SPSU and families of staff, students of educational the SPSU institutions, prisoners and persons detained. There is another fruit of modern presence of catholic chaplaincy in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine – the edition in December 2012 of a manual called «To minister prisoners». This book gives important guidelines for ministry in penitentiary institutions. The book is useful for seminarians, priests and volunteers of this wonderful ministry. Authors who participated in writing the book: Ph.D. Sergey Zamula, Th.M. Yuri Cousio, Fr. Dr. Jaroslav Storonyak, Igor Car, Fr. Basil Pantelyuk, Fr. Emelyan Kolodchak and Fr. Constantine Pantelei – endeavored to share with readers the best achievements in the field of Prison Ministry of the Church. In July - August 2013 representative of the UGCC took an active part in interdenominational group for the development of proposals for the Draft Law on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine (concerning the regulation of the activities of chaplains in the organs and institutions belonging to the jurisdiction of the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine) № 3233. On July 20, 2014 before a crowd of 200,000 faithful at the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Zarvanytsia in Ukraine, Patriarch Sviatoslav Shevchuk solemnly proclaimed Blessed Bishop and Martyr Vasyl Velychkovsky as patron of prison ministry for Clergy, Religious and Faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The blessed hieromartyr and years-long prisoner of the Soviet GULAG and the locum tenens of the underground Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine was elected not by chance: he got to the NKVD confines, and during his stay in inhuman conditions in the death ward the saint showed by his own example how to preserve human dignity and teach it other people. On June 11, 2015 came into force a law on prison chaplaincy. We can see now rapid development and maturation of prison pastoral mission of the Ukrainian Catholic Church through engagement of its lay and pastoral resources. Planning and coordination of the ministry facilitates the improvement of evangelization behind bars. Pastoral care is embracing not just offenders but prison personnel as well. It gives more chances for the establishment of a prison chaplaincy institution in Ukraine that meets European prison standards. It means reform and development of the criminal justice and prison system in Ukraine towards regard of the human rights of inmates. But mission of the Church in prison has new challenges and demands. Church in Ukraine is giving a worthy reply to the spiritual hunger of prisoners and this serves for restoration the moral health of society. Prison Ministry of the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine Grzegorz Draus is the head chaplain of the Roman Catholic prison ministry in Ukraine. The most active prison chaplains are Oblate Fathers. Since September, 2000 Fr. Draus started to work among prisoners in two penal institutions. From the beginning of his ministry in Ukraine Fr. Grzegorz does his best efforts to animate the local RCC ordinaries to promote prison pastoral care and the humanisation of the prison system of Ukraine. He was a Board Chairperson of the Ukrainian Interdenominational Christian Mission during 2007 - 2011 as well. On the background of the program elaborated with the Greek-Catholic Chaplaincy in the year 2008 he developed the educational seminar for Christian Churches Ministry in Prisons. The goal was to promote active cooperation with Christian Churches and Denominations, taking into account specificities of Ukrainian Penal System institutions. Heads of the regional Prison Management Units of Ukraine made reports about improving of cooperation of prison personnel with chaplains and volunteers. The officials recognized the positive changes of convicts under the influence of pastoral care. Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine has 7 dioceses. Because of lack of pastoral resources, regular pastoral care is established just in 11 prisons: Lviv - Remad Prison and Prison Facility, Rivne Detention Center and Prison of Horodyshche, High security prison of Izaslav, Raykivtsi (Khmelnytsky region), Prison of Kharkiv, Prison of Vinnitsa, Prison of Sumy, Prison of Poltava, Prison of Odessa. In 6 more prisons pastors could come just occasionally Prisons regularly attends 7 priests and 3 pastoral assistants. The most active prison chaplains are Oblate Fathers. Since 2011 till now there are significant obstacles in visiting penal institutions under various pretexts. In particular, authorities have given a need for priests who have Polish citizenship to execute each time a separate permit to visit one institution. These restrictions are introduced by President Yanukovych, but they are still applied. In the Year of Marcy held in the Jubilee the events in prison with participation of local bishop in Lviv. RCC in Ukraine is a member of the Ukrainian Interdenominational Christian Mission \\"Spiritual and Charitable Care in Prisons\\", as mentioned before, includes twelve Churches and Denominations.

Life He was eldest son of William Redgrave, and brother of Richard Redgrave, and was born at 9 Upper Eaton Street, Pimlico, London. When about 14 years old he obtained a clerkship at the Home Office, and in his leisure time studied French, German, and Spanish, and practised watercolour painting and architectural drawing. He was admitted in 1833 as an architectural student of the Royal Academy. He subsequently received a permanent appointment at the Home Office, and worked on the registration of criminal offences. In 1836 he acted as secretary to the constabulary force commission, and in May 1839 became assistant private secretary to Lord John Russell, and then to Fox Maule, until September 1841. Later, from December 1852 to February 1856, he was private secretary to Henry Fitzroy. He retired from public service in 1860, and devoted the rest of his life to art. He had been secretary to the Etching Club since 1842, and knew leading artists. At the International Exhibition of 1862 the watercolour gallery was arranged by him, and the loan collection of miniatures exhibited at the South Kensington Museum in 1865 was under his management. His efforts contributed to the National Portrait exhibitions of 1866, 1867, and 1868, and the gallery of British art in the Paris International Exhibition of 1867 was under his direction. He also acted as secretary to the committee which carried out the exhibitions of the works of old masters and deceased British artists held at the Royal Academy from 1870, but then retired on the appointment of a lay secretary to the Academy in 1873. Redgrave died at 17 Hyde Park Gate South, London in 1876, and was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity, Brompton. Works During the tenure of the Home Office by Sir George Grey he prepared under direction a volume entitled Some Account of the Powers, Authorities, and Duties of Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, which was printed for official use in 1852. This work led him to compile Murray's Official Handbook of Church and State, which was published in 1852 and again in 1855. His first contribution to the literature of art was A Century of Painters of the British School, written with his brother Richard, and first published in 1866. This was followed in 1874 by his Dictionary of Artists of the English School, and in 1877 by a Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Collection of Water-colour Paintings in the South Kensington Museum, on which he was engaged at the time of his death. He also compiled the Catalogue of the Loan Exhibition of Fans, 1870, which was followed by Fans of all Countries, a folio volume issued in 1871, and he assisted in the compilation of the Catalogue of the Paintings, Miniatures, &c.;, bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum by the Rev.

His two-volume 1926 work Pottery of Costa Rica and Nicaragua is regarded as a pioneering study. Lothrop was a longtime research associate of Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and made many contributions based on fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and evaluations of private and public collections that focused on Central and South America. He is known for archaeological excavations in Argentina and Chile as well as investigations of the archaeological contexts for the stone spheres of Costa Rica. Lothrop is also known for his research on goldwork and other artifacts from Costa Rica, the Veraguas Province of Panama, and the Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, Mexico. Early life Lothrop was a descendant of his namesake, prominent Unitarian minister Samuel Kirkland Lothrop.Lothrop, Thorton Kirkland. Some Reminiscences of the Life of Samuel Kirkland Lothrop. Cambridge: John Wilson and Son. UP, 1888. Print. He was born in Milton, Massachusetts on July 6, 1892 to William and Alice Lothrop. His childhood was split between Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. Lothrop’s interest in Latin America may have been sparked in his childhood as a result of his having spent time in Puerto Rico, where his father was a banker with interests in the sugarcane industry.Ayala, César J. American Sugar Kingdom: the Plantation Economy of the Spanish Caribbean, 1898-1934. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1999. Print. =Education= Lothrop began his education at Groton School, a private boarding school in Massachusetts. He entered Harvard University in 1911, where he completed his undergraduate studies in 1915. In 1914 he married Rachel Warren, daughter of Fiske and Gretchen Osgood Warren. After completing his undergraduate studies he began graduate school at Harvard, focusing on anthropology and archaeology. He traveled extensively throughout Central America as a research associate of the Peabody Museum, excavating various areas and studying collections. His travels and excavations were interrupted by the eruption of World War I, where he served in military intelligence.Harris, Charles H., and Louis R. Sadler. The Archaeologist Was a Spy: Sylvanus G. Morley and the Office of Naval intelligence. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 2003. Print. After the war, he returned to his graduate work, eventually earning his Ph.D. with a doctoral dissertation, a version of which was published in 1926 as Pottery of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Military career Lothrop was engaged in espionage for the U.S. prior to and during World War I and for the Office of Strategic Services prior to and during World War II. Using anthropologists for gathering intelligence was a common practice of the time. Given their ability to observe cultural practices as well as those useful to strategies of war, not to mention the fact that they could use their careers as a cover for their intelligence gathering, anthropologists are ideal choices for spies.Price, David (2000) Anthropologists as Spies, The Nation. During World War II, he was not excavating once again, because of the time spent working for the military. His position in the military did however give him the opportunity to travel while compositing notes on various sites. Career After completing his doctorate studies, Lothrop worked field excavations in the Yucatan and Guatemala under the employment of the Carnegie Institution’s Historical Division. His research resulted in the 1924 publishing of the monograph of his mapping of the Mayan Ruin of Tulum. From 1924 until the end of the stock market crash in 1929 Samuel Kirkland Lothrop was employed by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. It was during 1929 also that he married his second wife, Eleanor Bachman of Philadelphia. His work while he was on staff at the museum was also focused on Latin America and it was during this time that he established a relationship with Fernando Marquez Miranda. It was through this relationship that Lothrop was one of the few foreigners allowed to conduct excavations in Argentine Territory. =Notable excavations= Sitio Conte In the 1930s after the closing of the museum, Lothrop returned to the Peabody Museum staff as field director of the Sitio Conte in Central Panama. Before he returned, the Peabody museum had purchased a collection of jewelry excavated from a burial ground. After obtaining permission from the government and the landowner, the museum excavated the burial grounds during the dry seasons from 1930-1933. =Stone spheres of Costa Rica= In 1943 through a publication of American Antiquity by Doris Stone, Lothrop first encountered the mysterious stone spheres. In 1948 he and his wife met up with Doris Stone and she collaborated with them, setting them up with a place to excavate. The stone spheres are a topic of discussion, concerning how these objects were formed and by whom. Lothrop’s research resulted in the theory that the balls were placed in alignments significant astronomically.[Area, By Ufo. \\"Fortean Times Message Board :: View Topic - Stone Spheres.\\" Fortean Times Magazine  Weird News  Strange Pictures  Videos. Web. 25 Oct. 2010. .] During his research Lothrop recorded 186 balls as reported in his 1963 publication, Archaeology of the Diquís Delta.[Coppins, Phillip. \\"Rolling Stones.\\" Philip Coppens.com. Web. 25 Oct. 2010. .] Lothrop determined that the spheres were formed over many centuries, suggesting a cultural practice and continuity over an extended period of time. His conclusions were based on analyzing the pottery types.[The Diquis Spheres - Costa Rican Stone Spheres - An Archaeological Mystery - By Dr. Tim McGuinness, Ph.D. Web. 25 Oct. 2010. <>.] Notable accomplishments Lothrop continued to be a contributor to the field up until his death in 1965. Late in life he wrote a book titled The Treasures of Ancient America: The Arts of the Pre-Columbian Civilizations from Mexico to Peru (1964), Editions d'Art Albert Skira, Geneva, 230 pp. As a result of his numerous publications and contributions to the field he was the recipient of numerous honors, medals, and awards. Lothrop was cited by the American Society for American Archaeology in 1960. He also received the Loubat Prize awarded by Columbia University. The Alfred Kidder Vincent Medal given by the Society of American Archaeology. The Royal Anthropological Institute awarded Lothrop the Huxley Memorial Medal.

Westerling was a demobilised Dutch Captain of the KNIL (Royal Netherlands East Indies Army), who sought to preserve the federal Republic of the United States of Indonesia, which retained the support of the Netherlands and various minority elements. Westerling's forces succeeded in capturing Bandung in the early hours of 23 January 1950. Simultaneously, the APRA infiltrated Jakarta as part of a coup d’état to overthrow the RUSI Cabinet. Their plan was to arrest and assassinate several prominent Republican figures including the Defence Minister Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and Secretary- General Ali Budiardjo. However, Westerling's forces in Jakarta were killed or captured by the Indonesian army and police forces. The APRA was forced out of Bandung, while Westerling escaped to Singapore. After a mopping up campaign the Legion of Ratu Adil had ceased to function in February 1950. The coup d'état led to the downfall of Sultan Hamid II and accelerated the integration of the RUSI into the Republic by 17 August 1950.Kahin (1952), p. 454-56 Rise of the APRA Prior to the transfer of sovereignty on 27 December 1949, a RUSI Cabinet consisting of both Republican and Federalist members was formed on 17 December 1949. This Cabinet was headed by Prime Minister Mohammad Hatta and included 11 Republicans and five Federalists including the pro-Dutch Sultan Hamid II. Ultimately, this federal government was short-lived due to conflicting differences between the Republicans and the Federalists as well as growing popular support for a unitary state.Kahin (1952), p. 448-48 Growing tensions between the Republicans and Federalists prompted Hamid II to conspire with the former commander of the DST (Depot Special Forces) commando unit Raymond Westerling to organize an anti-Republican coup d’état which would ensure a federal Republic of the United States of Indonesia. By January 1950, Westerling had built up a militia force known as Angkatan Perang Ratu Adil (APRA, Legion of Ratu Adil). Raymond Westerling stated that the APRA counted 22,000 men. American historian George Kahin estimates it was about 2,000 men. The APRA comprised various Republican elements including defectors from the Indonesian army, Islamic and communist battle groups. The Legion was further augmented by elements of the KNIL, Royal Netherlands Army, Westerling's old commando unit and several sympathetic Dutch nationals including two police inspectors. The Republican government attempted to negotiate with Westerling by offering to pay him US$100,000 in exchange for renouncing his revolutionary activities, but Westerling rejected the offer.Westerling (1952), p. 198 On 5 January 1950, Westerling sent an ultimatum to the government of Jakarta. His demands were the recognition of the APRA as the official army of the state of Pasundan and unconditional respect for the autonomy of the federal states. Westerling added that if the answer was not positive, he could not be held responsible for the outbreak of large-scale fighting by the APRA. With no reply to his ultimatum, Westerling started the coup in the night of 22–23 January, a month after international recognition of the Republic of Indonesia.De Moor (1999) 413-36 Attacks against Bandung and Jakarta Westerling's planned coup d’état involved the near-simultaneous capture of Bandung and Jakarta, followed by the capture of Buitenzorg (modern-day Bogor) where some minor government departments were based. On 22 January, Westerling's troops would infiltrate Bandung on board trucks, disguised as members of the Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI). At 10 pm, they would seize ammunition stocks from the old KNIL arms depot in Bandung and then dispatch them to a rendezvous point 15 miles away for delivery to Djakarta by 11 pm. At 5 am on 23 January, APRA forces based in nearby Tjimahi would capture strategic locations like military bases, police stations, and government buildings and communications facilities throughout Bandung and Jakarta. At dawn, about 520 APRA soldiers entered Bandung. However, the Siliwangi Division, which was encamped in the city, had been forewarned of Westerling's plans. A motorized unit was sent to intercept the Legion, but was quickly defeated. Advancing through Bandung, the APRA captured key locations including the TNI's headquarters and the Siliwangi barracks. Within an hour, they had secured the city center and eliminated all resistance. TNI Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Lembong and 93 other Indonesian soldiers and officers were killed. The majority of the TNI forces were taken by surprise and there were reports of soldiers discarding their uniforms and fleeing. TNI Colonel Erie Sudeweo sought refuge in the Dutch barracks.De Moor (1999) p. 437-72 However, the second phase of the coup d'état collapsed since the majority of the KNIL's commanders cooperated with the Indonesian government and refused to support Westerling's actions. A Dutch officer discovered the unloading of ammunition from the Bandung arms depot into trucks of the APRA. Due to this development, the ammunitions convoy did not arrive in the Republican capital Jakarta at 11 PM as planned. Westerling's Legion was unable to launch its scheduled attack at 5 AM on 23 January. There had been plans to seize the presidential palace, army barracks and to arrest Republican politicians including Sukarno, Hatta, Hamengkubuwono IX and Ali Budiardjo. Unable to find any ammunition, Westerling was forced to abort his attack by 6 AM. With the coup attempt in tatters, the APRA retreated from Bandung after negotiations with KNIL Major General Edu Engles. By 5 PM Republican forces under Sadikin had re-established control over Bandung.De Moor (1999), p. 473-79 Aftermath of the coup In the following weeks several small APRA units were defeated in a mopping up campaign by the Indonesian army and police. The Legion of Ratu Adil had ceased to function in February 1950. The attempted coup d'état increased public agitation for the dissolution of the federal system. Westerling escaped with the help of the Dutch government to Singapore. Despite attempts by the Indonesian government to extradite him, he lived in exile in the Netherlands until his death in 1987. By April 5, several key conspirators including Sultan Hamid II had been arrested by the Republican authorities. On April 19, Hamid II confessed to his involvement in the botched Jakarta coup and to planning a second attack on Parliament scheduled for February 15. Due to the presence of RUSI troops, the attack had been aborted. The role of the Pasundan government in the coup led to its dissolution by February 10, further undermining the federal structure. By late March 1950, Hamid's West Kalimantan was one of the four remaining federal states in the United States of Indonesia. Hamid's role in the coup led to increased agitation in West Kalimantan for its integration into the Republic of Indonesia. Following a fact-finding mission by the Government Commission, the RUSI House of Representatives voted, by a margin of fifty votes to one, to merge West Kalimantan into the Republic of Indonesia.Kahin (1952), p. 456 Following clashes with demobilized KNIL troops under Andi Aziz in Makassar and the attempted secession of an Ambonese Republic of South Moluccas, the federal United States of Indonesia was dissolved on 17 August 1950, turning Indonesia into a unitary state dominated by the central government in Jakarta.

Biography  Iraida Heinike was born in Riga, now the capital of the Republic of Latvia but then in the Russian Empire. Her father Gustav Heinike was a Baltic German lawyer. In 1918 she moved to St. Petersburg (then in the throes of revolution and recently rebaptized \\"Petrograd\\"), and adopted the pen name \\"Irina Odoyevtseva\\".The name (which has also been spelled \\"Odoevtseva\\", \\"Odoevceva\\" or \\"Odoevzev\\") can be translated as \\"Irene of the odes\\", referring to the genre of lyric poetry. The first name \\"Irene\\" stems from the Greek word eirena meaning \\"peace\\"; and the middle name \\"Vladimirovna\\" can be understood to refer as well to peace, since it includes the word мир = peace. (This is however a folk etymology, as shown by earlier spellings of the name, which more probably means \\"great is his power\\".) She joined the Second Guild of Poets, was tutored by Nikolai Gumilyov, whom she \\"worshipped\\",Pavel Malofeev, \\"Irina Odoyevtseva\\", Becoming Literate, June 25, 2015. and become his favorite student. According to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, she \\"enchanted everybody, her teacher included, with her brilliant, masterful poetry\\" and had tremendous success with her debut book Dvor Tchudes (The Yard of Wonders, 1922), \\"half- starved...петроградская полуголодная богема заучивала наизусть bohemia learning her 'Cabman' and 'Pressed-down Glass' poems by heart.\\" Formally an acmeist, Odoevtseva developed her own distinctive style and was in many ways ahead of her times, anticipating the latter experiments of oberiuts and even 1960s Soviet conceptualists. Her trademark was a distinctive speech impediment (she couldn't pronounce her \\"r\\"'s), which she mentioned a number of times in her later autobiographies \\"On the Banks of Neva\\" and \\"On the Banks of Seine\\". In 1921 she married the poet Georgy Ivanov, a prominent acmeist. In 1922 the couple emigrated to Paris. There she wrote several novels which enjoyed good sales and were translated into other languages (Angel of Death, 1927; Isolde, 1931; Abandon All Hope, 1948); but she was more successful in later life with her memoirs, On the Banks of Neva (1967) and On the Banks of Seine (1983), with their many personal anecdotes about the famous artists she had known: Nikolai Gumilyov, Georgy Ivanov, Osip Mandelstam, Zinaida Gippius, Dmitri Merezhkovsky, Andrey Bely and Ivan Bunin among others. These two books caused much controversy among the Russians in France but still \\"might be regarded as a priceless document of the time, even if full of aberrations and frivolous twists of fantasy,\\" according to poet and Russian poetry historian Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Her marriage to Georgy Ivanov, though it lasted 37 years, \\"had little to do with the usual concepts of conjugal life,\\" according to her biographer Ella Bobrova.Ella Bobrow, Irina Odoevtseva (Buffalo, NY: Mosaic Press, 1996), p. 148. An example of their wild life can be found in the papers of the French writer Georges Bataille: \\"In December 1937 [...] Laure and myself prepared a dinner: we were expecting Ivanov and Odoyevtseva. Just as we had planned, the dinner proved no less wild than the wind blowing that day. Odoevtseva, naked, began to vomit.\\"Notebooks for Le Coupable, in Georges Bataille, Oeuvres Complètes vol. 5 (Paris: Gallimard), p. 524-525. During the Second World War, the couple joined the exodus from Paris and lived in a villa in the coastal resort town of Biarritz, which they had bought in 1932 when Odoyevtseva received an inheritance upon her father's death. The town was occupied by German troops in the summer of 1940. In 1943 their house was requisitioned by the German army, but they remained in Biarritz until 1946. Their house had been looted and later destroyed by American bombing. But the Ivanovs' social position during the war years would later lead to Georgy being charged with nazi sympathies, particularly by his former friend Georgy Adamovich.Irina Lukyanova, \\"On Snowbound Fate\\", Russkii Mir magazine, October 2014, accessed 23 September 2016. After the War, Ivanov and Odoyevtseva moved back to Paris, but their flat had been looted. They were both excluded from the literary world, which was now dominated by Communists and where their alleged nazi sympathies earned them ostracism. They lived in more or less desperate poverty, and Ivanov sank into alcoholism. In the early 1950s Ivanov had to move into an assisted living environment. He managed to get into the \\"Russian House\\" in Juan-les-Pins in the south of France, a subsidized home for destitute immigrants; then in the winter of 1953 he moved into a government shelter for the elderly in Hyères, also on the southern coast. He died in Hyères in 1958. Twenty years after Ivanov's death Odoevtseva married another émigré writer, Jacques Gorbof (born Yakov Gorbov), whose work she had translated in the 1950s. She lived with him until his death in 1981. In 1987, taking advantage of the relaxation of border restrictions, Odoyevtseva returned to Leningrad. She enjoyed a warm public welcome there, and for a couple of years, as Yevtushenko puts it, \\"was transported from one concert stage to another as a kind of a talking relic and was, indeed, talking a lot — in the most gracious manner, at that.\\" A popular figure on Russian TV during the Perestroika period, Odoyevtseva enjoyed some commercial success too, having 200,000 copies of her memoirs sold — a figure far surpassing whatever she might have sold through her 65 years abroad. She died in Leningrad three years later. Works in English translation  * Out of Childhood (original title: Angel' smerti), London: Constable, 1930 * Isolde (original title: Izol'da), tr.

He is the most successful Croatian Himalayan climber. Božić completed the Seven Summits and is the second European, after Reinhold Messner, to climb the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest, twice. He has directed more than 60 documentary films, mostly related to mountains and climbing. Early life Božić was born in the village of Zavojane near Vrgorac (at the time SR Croatia, FPR Yugoslavia). When he finished elementary school, he moved with his parents and sister to Split, where his father, a winegrower, found a job as a driver. In Split, Božić enrolled in a high school, joined the scouts, and started with mountain climbing. His parents, who were rather strict, did not approve, and did not accept his hobby until much later, after reading about their son's achievements in the newspapers. After finishing high school, Božić worked as an electrician on an ocean liner, but quit his job as soon as he saved enough money to buy climbing gear. Mountaineering career Božić's first notable Himalayan climb was the 1979 ascent to Mount Everest as a member of the Yugoslav expedition that used a previously unclimbed West Ridge route, known today as the Complete West Ridge. A similar path was chosen by a 1974 French expedition that ended in disaster when six climbers were killed in an avalanche, but Yugoslav team leader Tone Škarja modified the route so as to avoid the avalanche fall-lines. The large expedition, numbering 25 climbers, arrived at Base Camp on 31 March and progressed smoothly through four additional bases. Andrej Štremfelj and Nejc Zaplotnik reached the summit on 13 May, followed two days later by Stane Belak, Ang Phu and Božić (becoming the 85th through 89th persons to have climbed Mount Everest). On descent, the weather worsened quickly and the team were unable to return to Base Four before dark and were forced to spend the night in a temperature, without tents or sleeping bags, at an altitude of . According to Božić, at the time this was the highest ever overnight bivouac in the open, and the closest he had ever been to death. They managed to survive the night, but on the following day, Ang Phu slipped and fell to his death going through the Hornbein Couloir. The difficulty of the Everest West Ridge route is reflected by the fact that, as of 2000, 21 teams attempted it, but only 3 succeeded. This 1979 climb is considered by many as one of the finest in the history of Everest. Božić second Himalayan ascent was Lhotse in 1981, with a Slovenian team via a new South face route. Although he failed to get to the summit, reaching in a solo climb on the south rock wall, Božić considered his Lhotse effort technically the most demanding and possibly his greatest Himalayan success. The following year, Božić summited Kang Guru with two Croatian climbers. The 1983 expedition to Manaslu ended in disaster when Nejc Zaplotnik and Ante Bućan were killed in an ice avalanche. Božić returned to the same mountain a year later in a successful climb with Slovenian climber Viki Grošelj. In 1985 Božić was climbing in the Alps: Eiger via the classic north face route, and Grandes Jorasses via the Cassin route. Božić returned to Mount Everest in 1989, with a Macedonian expedition. An easier route was used, but the ascent was difficult for Božić because, having caught a bad cold, he suffered from hallucinations, and did not have a full recollection of the events afterwards. Macedonian member of the team Dimitar Ilievski died on the mountain. Božić's successful ascent on 10 May made him only the second European, after Reinhold Messner, to climb Mount Everest twice. After a successful climb to Kanchenjunga (1991) and an unsuccessful one to Annapurna (1992), Božić climbed K2 in 1993. The expedition's progress was smooth until shortly before the top of the climb, when the weather worsened. Božić, Viki Grošelj, Carlos Carsolio and Zvonko Požgaj were only able to touch the summit, because standing on it would have been impossible due to high winds. On the way back, the team got lost in the snowstorm, but ultimately managed to get to base four, where they found Boris Sedej and Boštjan Kekec. The latter was in distress, showing symptoms of hypoxia, his condition worsening. Due to the urgency of the situation, Sedej, Požgaj and Božić descended with Kekec through the snowstorm. Soon Kekec was unable to walk and became unresponsive, and the trio pulled him through the deep snow. When this became physically too difficult and when Požgaj began to suffer from frostbite, they decided to leave Kekec to die on the mountain. Božić was affected by snow blindness and barely made it to safety, using only the climbing rope to direct himself back to the base camp. Stipe Božić completed the Seven Summits in 2000. The sequence of his climbs was: Mont Blanc (1974), Mount Everest (1979 and 1989), Aconcagua, Mount McKinley, Mount Kosciuszko and Kilimanjaro (all 1996), Mount Vinson (1997), and Elbrus (2000). In 2003 Božić expressed his desire to climb Mount Tyree, the second highest mountain of Antarctica. This would have made him the first person in the world to climb two highest peaks on each of the seven continents, i.e. to complete both Seven Summits and Seven Second Summits. Filmmaking career and other activities Sedam vrhova (Seven Summits) is Stipe Božić's 250-page autobiography, published in 2003. Božić has been photographing and filming his climbing experiences since his ascent to Noshaq in 1975, made into a television documentary Hindukush '75 for RTV Sarajevo. He carried a camera to Mount Everest in 1979, when he refused to jettison it even in the most difficult circumstances. Božić went on to carry a camera on nearly all of his Himalayan expeditions. He has directed more than 60 documentary films, among them a documentary series Sedam vrhova (Seven Summits), which is also the name of his autobiography published in 2003. For a while, Božić worked as a journalist, and wrote articles for Slobodna Dalmacija, Večernji list, and National Geographic. During the Croatian War of Independence Božić used to assist the Croatian Army in mountainous regions of Croatia that were war zones. In February 1992 he was wounded by shrapnel. Besides mountaineering Božić has been also involved in speleology and desert exploration. In 1994 he descended into Lukina jama, the deep pit which is a part of the Velebit cave complex. His 11-part documentary series Pustinje svijeta (Deserts of the World), premiered in early 2010, was produced by the Croatian Radiotelevision. For more than 30 years Božić has been volunteering for the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service, and is currently the head of its Split branch. He took part in hundreds of search and rescue operations, most notably in the helicopter evacuation of thirteen dead and injured firefighters from Kornat island in August 2007. Personal life Stipe Božić is married to Vera, a civil construction engineer. The two met in Bormio, Italy in 1980, where Stipe, who is a certified ski instructor, gave ski lessons. Together they have two daughters, Maja (born c. 1988) and Iva (born c. 1990). His wife climbed Kilimanjaro with him in 1996. Stipe had a son, Joško (born 1975), from his first marriage. Joško was, like his father, a mountain climber and a rescuer for the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service. He was killed with his wife Ana in a motorcycle accident in June 2007.

Changes in gene dosage, the number of times a given gene is present in the cell nucleus, can create a genetic imbalance.  Effects  This imbalance in gene dosage alters the amount of a particular protein relative to all other proteins, and this alternation in the relative amounts of protein can have a variety of phenotypic effects. These effects are depending on how the proteins function and how critical the maintenance of a precise ratio of proteins is to the survival of the organism. Diminishing the dosage of most genes produces no obvious change in phenotype. For some genes the phenotypic consequences of a decrease in gene dosage are noticeable but not catastrophic. For example, Drosophila containing only one copy of the wild type Notch gene has visible wing abnormalities but otherwise seems to function normally. For some rare genes, the normal diploid level of gene expression is essential to individual survival; fewer than two copies of such a gene results in lethality. In Drosophila, a single dose of the locus known as Triplolethal is in an otherwise diploid individual. Although a single dose of any gene may not cause substantial harm to the individual, the genetic imbalance resulting from a single dose of many genes at the same time can be lethal.

Its actual origins, however, lie in three private enterprises which, under crown patronage, were trying to establish the production of \\"white gold\\" (i.e. porcelain) in Berlin from the mid-18th century onwards. The company logo is a cobalt blue sceptre, which is stamped (painted prior to 1837) on every piece. All painted pieces produced by KPM are signed by the painter. KPM is still producing to this day; each piece of dishware and decorative porcelain is entirely unique. KPM has produced a number of dishware forms and porcelain figurines throughout its history. Some forms have hardly changed their shape in over 200 years of production. Frederick the Great, who, as the owner, jokingly referred to himself as his own \\"best customer\\", was under the spell of the Rococo style during his life; a culmination of this artistic style can be seen in his castles. To this day, the most successful designs of the 1930s are the Urbino, Urania and Arkadia (originally a tea set designed in honor of KPM's 175th anniversary) created by Trude Petri. The Arkadia medallions were created by Siegmund Schütz and the Urania set (with the same basic form as the Arkadia) did not enter production until after the war, as was also the case with the Arkadia table set. Porcelain figurines of different styles corresponding to each era have always been created under the guidance of the master workshop, including the modern animal sculptures, such as the miniature Buddy Bear or the Knut Bear. History =Beginnings= Created for Pope Pius VII by special order of Frederick William III of Prussia, c. 1823 Before KPM was founded, two attempts had already been made to establish a porcelain manufactory in Berlin. In 1751, the Berlin wool manufacturer Wilhelm Caspar Wegely was granted the royal privilege to set up a porcelain manufactory in Berlin. Furthermore, Frederick II of Prussia granted him exemption from duties for the import of essential materials and assured him of the exclusion of all competition. Wegely hired first-class craftsmen from his competitors, and appointed the porcelain sculptor Ernst Heinrich Reichard to the post of chief modeller. However, technical difficulties and the Seven Years’ War between Prussia and Saxony soon proved to be the enterprise's downfall. In 1757, he dissolved his company and sold its inventories, equipment and materials to the Berlin businessman Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. In 1761, the second porcelain manufactory in Berlin started its operations. Gotzkowsky concluded an agreement with Wegely's chief modeller, Ernst Heinrich Reichard, who was in possession of the secret formula known as the arcanum. Reichard received 4,000 thaler for the arcanum, and another 3,000 for the stock of porcelain and other materials. Furthermore, he undertook to work for Gotzkowsky as a keeper of the arcanum and as the manager. Gotzkowsky also agreed to take over Reichard's eight workers. Appreciated and supported by the King of Prussia, Gotzkowsky managed to attract important artists and qualified employees. Right at the start, Gotzkowsky appointed Friedrich Elias Meyer, a pupil of Johann Joachim Kändler who came from Meissen, to the post of chief modeller, and Carl Wilhelm Boehme to the post of head of the porcelain-painting department. Gotzkowsky bought another building next to his own property at Leipziger Straße 4, and he began to build a manufactory on the site. Nevertheless, Gotzkowsky's finances began to deteriorate. Since the royal exchequer was in the red on account of the war, Gotzkowsky believed that he stood little or no chance of obtaining assistance from the king. The end of the war also signalled the end for Gotzkowsky's manufactory. Today, the porcelain pieces from the early days marked with a W for Wegely und a G for Gotzkowsky are extremely rare and highly coveted collector's items. =Foundation= On 19 September 1763, Frederick II officially became the manufactory's new owner. He purchased the manufactory for the considerable sum of 225,000 thaler and took over the staff of 146 workers. He gave the business its name and allowed it to use the royal sceptre as its symbol. From then on, it was called the Königliche Porzellan- Manufaktur Berlin (\\"Royal Porcelain Manufactory Berlin\\") and became a model of how to run a business. There was no child labour, there were regular working hours, above-average incomes, secure pensions, a healthcare fund and assistance for widows and orphans. =Rococo= KPM Rococo-inspired porcelain vase and plinth Among the manufactory's most important clients was Frederick the Great, who sometimes jokingly referred to himself as his “best customer”. From 1765 to his death in 1786, Frederick II placed orders with KPM for porcelain to the value of 200,000 thaler. For his palaces alone, he ordered 21 dinner services, each of them with 36 place settings and up to 500 separate parts, complemented by elaborate table centrepieces. The services’ design and colouring was meticulously created to match the interior decoration of the rooms in which they were to be used. Frederick commissioned the first KPM table service in 1765 for the New Palace in Potsdam. The dinner service known as Reliefzierat was designed in the Rococo style by modelling master Friedrich Elias Meyer, who would later design many more services for the king. The ornamentation of the relief, made of gilded rocailles and flower espaliers, finds its counterpart in the stucco ceiling of the New Palace. The following years saw the appearance of the Neuzierat, Neuglatt, Neuosier and Antique Zierat (later named Rocaille) dinner services, which are still produced today. In 1784, after a four-year development period, the king's desire for a soft and delicate shade of blue was fulfilled. The colour was known as Bleu mourant (\\"dying blue\\"), and it was used to decorate Neuzierat, Frederick's favourite dinner service. The colour was predominant in the king's private chambers at Sanssouci Palace and in the blue chamber of the New Palace in Potsdam, as well as in other castles. As owner of KPM, the king used the \\"white gold\\" as an effective means of diplomacy. Almost all of his diplomatic presents came from the manufactory, and they were to be found at the court of the tsars in Russia and on the tables of European aristocracy. =Classicism= KPM porcelain krater vase given by Frederick William IV of Prussia to his sister Alexandrine, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, c. 1851 Under Frederick the Great's successor, his nephew Frederick William II, the manufactory became a technologically leading enterprise. The new king obtained what he needed in the way of porcelain from KPM, but stopped paying cash. The amounts due were deducted from his share of the profits. The manufactory flourished. From 1787 onwards, the average annual net profit came to more than 40,000 thaler. After the death of Frederick the Great, there was a stylistic turning point in Prussia. The cheerful soft-brush forms of Rococo gave way to the distinct lines of Classicism. In 1790, a dinner service in the new style was designed by KPM: KURLAND, which has been one of the greatest successes of the manufactory up to date. It bears the name of its commissioner, Peter von Biron, Duke of Kurland, one of the richest and most refined men of his time. Renowned artists of the time, like Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Johann Gottfried Schadow and his pupil Christian Daniel Rauch designed vases and sculptures for KPM. The most famous item among them is the Prinzessinengruppe (Two Princesses), after a design by Johann Gottfried Schadow. In the first half of the 19th century, KPM was a leader in the production of pictorial and veduta porcelain among the big European manufactories. One of the most important veduta painters was Carl Daniel Freydanck. Under the leadership of Georg Friedrich Christoph Frick, the manufactory's managing director from 1832, Freydanck designed a series of works depicting beautiful cityscapes of Berlin and Potsdam. Presented as regal gifts, they shaped the image of a new Berlin in the eyes of other European sovereigns. =New manufactory= In 1867, KPM had to make way for the construction of the Prussian Parliament close to Potsdamer Platz. The new building was on the edge of the Tiergarten. It cost 360,000 thaler. On account of its position by the river Spree, it was now possible to transport raw materials and manufactured goods on barges. Constructed between 1868 and 1872, it was equipped with the most modern techniques of the day. KPM has always been a pioneer in the ceramic industry from a technological aspect. This is particularly true regarding the discoveries and technical progress that came about in the late 19th century. Since 1878, the manufactory has been associated with a Chemical-Technical Research Institute. The institute's director, Hermann August Seger, produced numerous innovations that substantially increased KPM's proficiency in designing moulds and working with colours. Among his many inventions, Seger developed new kinds of porcelain underglaze colours, as can be seen on the wall plate showing a view of Berlin Cathedral. Oxblood, celadon, crystal- and dripped glazes were created, inspired by Chinese ceramics. They enabled new forms of artistic expression, which made Seger into an early pioneer of Art Nouveau. =Art Nouveau= In 1886, Alexander Kips was appointed artistic director of KPM Berlin. With painted porcelain tiles, he helped the company to achieve commercial success. His successor, Theodor Schmuz-Baudiss, artistic director as of 1908, promoted the use of Seger's glazes, and thus brought KPM fame and admiration at international art exhibitions. KPM's Wedding Procession is one of the most significant pieces of Berlin Art Nouveau. The sculptor, Adolf Amberg, created the design of centerpiece consisting of several figurines made of silver, in honour of the wedding of Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia and Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. However, the design was too daring for the court, as the bride was depicted naked. Theodor Schmuz- Baudiss recognised the artistic significance of the design and had it transformed into porcelain in 1908. The Wedding Procession was awarded the gold medal at the 1910 World Exposition in Brussels. After the demise of the monarchy in 1918, KPM became the State Porcelain Manufactory Berlin. However, the KPM mark and the sceptre were retained. =Bauhaus and New Objectivity= Under the new director, Günther von Pechmann, the ideas of Deutscher Werkbund and Bauhaus influenced the craftsmen of KPM Berlin from 1929 onwards. The aim was to design contemporary, matter-of-fact household porcelain. Famous designs of this time encompass Trude Petri's dinner service URBINO, and Marguerite Friedlaender's Halle vases, created in cooperation with Burg Giebichenstein Art School. In the 1930s, the assumption of power by the National Socialists had serious consequences for many of KPM's artists: Marguerite Friedlaender was forced to emigrate because of her Jewish background. Ludwig Gies and Gerhard Marcks were dismissed and denied exhibitions because of their loyalty with Jewish colleagues. In 1941, the art teacher, painter and writer Gerhard Gollwitzer, who had been dismissed from his teaching position, became artistic director of KPM. In the nights of 22 and 23 November 1943, the manufactory's premises were destroyed in an Allied air raid. =New paths= After World War II, KPM moved into temporary quarters in Selb, Upper Franconia, where there had once been plans to enlarge the company. From Franconia, KPM continued to supply the market with decorative porcelain and tableware. In the meantime, some of the staff reconstructed the Berlin premises. In 1957, manufacturing returned to the historic premises in Berlin's Tiergarten district after they had been rebuilt. As a result of a resolution adopted by the Senate of Berlin in 1988, KPM became a limited company and was now called KPM Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin GmbH. In the 1990s, KPM began to re-emphasize its cultural and craft traditions. It rediscovered historic shapes, colours and patterns. Important dinner services from the era of New Objectivity were reissued. After the triumphant success of a vase collection launched in 1994, KPM presented the BERLIN dinner service, created in cooperation with the Italian modernist designer Enzo Mari. From 1998 to 2003, the KPM QUARTIER was refurbished by architects Gerkan, Marg and Partners according to curatorial standards. At the same time, the production technology was updated. In 2006, after several previous attempts at privatisation, Berlin banker Jörg Woltmann took over the Royal Porcelain Manufactory Berlin and became the sole shareholder. In the same year, KPM opened its newly designed sales gallery in the historic kiln hall. Additional KPM shops are located in Berlin, Potsdam, Hamburg and Cologne. In 2007, the company opened the KPM WELT exhibition at the KPM QUARTIER, a company museum dedicated to the company's 250 years of history and craftsmanship of making porcelain. In the recent past, new ground has been broken through collaborations with luxury brands, such as Bottega Veneta and Bugatti Automobiles. In 2011, KPM designed the exterior and interior of a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport “L’Or Blanc” in cooperation with the car manufacturer. In 2012, a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport “Wei Long” was outfitted with dragon motifs. On the occasion of KPM's 250th anniversary in 2013, the special exhibition Royal Porcelain Manufactory Berlin 1763-2013 provided a representative overview of the manufactory's creative periods, with 300 works from 18 private collections. Brand =Sceptre= Iron-red orb and KPM marks, underglaze-blue sceptre and eagle and circle marks When Frederick the Great took over the manufactory from the Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky on 19 September 1763, he also provided the brand's emblem: the cobalt blue sceptre from the electoral coat-of-arms of Brandenburg. The porcelain is marked after the first firing and before the glazing process. Before the sceptre is applied to the porcelain, the item is subject to strict quality control measures. Afterwards, the porcelain is glazed and fired for the second time. The color bonds inseparably with the glaze and makes the piece of porcelain forgery-proof. In the beginning, the trademark was applied in blue on white porcelain and in brown on painted porcelain. In 1837, the letters KPM were added to protect the brand from counterfeits. A few years later, the royal Prussian eagle became part of the trademark. In the following decades, the trademark underwent slight changes until the production was transferred to Selb. In those years (1944-1957), the porcelain was marked with the letter “S” underneath the sceptre. In 2000, the letters KPM were reintroduced as part of the logo. =Imperial orb= Since 1803, painted porcelain has been receiving an additional mark in over glaze-colour to confirm the authenticity of the decor. Today, an imperial orb is usually stamped next to the sceptre. It is proof that the decor has been done by a KPM porcelain painter. The colour of the orb differs according to the type of decor. A red orb indicates all floral painting as well as figurative scenes and landscapes. A green orb is used for all non-floral decorative elements. Items with a blue orb are fired at a very high temperature and are dishwasher safe. A black orb is used to mark items with printed decor – for example, customized pieces featuring company logos. =Painters’ signature= Generally, the decors of KPM Berlin are hand painted. The porcelain painters are free to interpret the motifs within the design specifications. When finished, the painter signs the porcelain he has decorated. Each piece of porcelain thus becomes a unique work of art. Products KPM has created a large number of services, vases and figurines. The manufactory draws from an ever-growing stock of more than 150,000 moulds. Some of the moulds have been in production more or less unmodified since the company was established 250 years ago. =Tableware= Among the table services currently in production, there are three Rococo forms (ROCAILLE, NEUZIERAT and NEUOSIER), which originally were commissioned by Frederick the Great for his various palaces, and there are designs from the Classic, Art Nouveau and Bauhaus periods as well as from the present: * In 1767, KPM modelling master Friedrich Elias Meyer created a table service in the style of the Prussian Rococo for Wroclaw Palace. It was during the reign of Frederick William IV that the form, still produced today, was given its current name ROCAILLE. The prestigious service that amongst other occasions was also ordered for the Potsdam City Palace, received various forms of décor, personally influenced by Frederick the Great. Today, ROCAILLE is used at state banquets in Bellevue Palace, the official seat of the President of Germany. * NEUZIERAT, the favourite service of Frederick the Great, was designed for the New Palace in Potsdam. It became famous for its flower decoration in a faint-blue colouring: Bleu mourant – “dying blue”. The king had a weakness for this colour, which was predominant in his private chambers at Sanssouci Palace. It took the manufactory four years to develop this particular shade of blue as porcelain colour. It is still produced today, according to a secret formula. * The design of NEUOSIER from 1770 is based on the model of nature. Inspired by the French osier (wickerwork) the relief simulates the structure of a woven basket. The handles are shaped as branches. Elaborately decorated with bouquets of flowers and golden foliage NEUOSIER was made for Crown Prince Frederick William II in 1780. After his accession to the throne, it was used at the royal table of Sanssouci Palace. * Around 1790, KPM produced a large “service with an antique border” in the classicist style for Peter von Biron, Duke of Kurland. The service was later renamed KURLAND in his honour. It is still one of the greatest successes of the manufactory today. English silverware served as design model for the relief adorning the rims of all items. KURLAND quickly found admirers in the Prussian royal family. King Frederick William II, the nephew of and successor to Frederick the Great, gave it to his uncle Prince Henry of Prussia in a particularly opulent decor with colourful natural field flowers. On the occasion of its 250th anniversary, KPM created two new interpretations of the classic tableware: KURLAND Blanc Nouveau which combines glazed surfaces and reliefs made of biscuit porcelain, and KURLAND Royal Noir with a precious black and gold decor. * In 1912, Theodor Schmuz-Baudiss designed CERES to mark KPM's 150th anniversary. The design pays tribute to the opulence of late Art Nouveau. At the same time it is one of KPM's last major works of this epoch. The relief on this shape consists of overflowing with fruit and ears of corn. * Along with ARKADIA and FELDBLUME, URBINO represents the era of New Objectivity and Bauhaus at KPM. Designer Trude Petri was awarded the Grand Prix at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris for her URBINO dinner service. The tureen is a good for the design's multi-functionality: The lid, when turned upside-down, can also be used as a bowl. As a modern classic URBINO is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. It is still one of KPM's best-selling products. * The ARKADIA tea set was created in 1938 on the occasion of KPM's 175th anniversary. Trude Petri, who had already designed the URBINO table service, created neo-classicist shapes in the style of New Objectivity. Siegmund Schütz took his inspiration for elaborate medallions from Greek mythology. The ARKADIA design also was basis for the development of FELDBLUME (1940) with a relief of wild flowers by Gerhard Gollwitzer and the plain-style URANIA (1990). * In 1996 KPM launched the “iF Design Award” winning BERLIN service, which was created in collaboration with the Italian designer Enzo Mari. Due to the convex rims the plates and bowls of the multi-functional service appear like a blossoming flower when stacked. =Sculptural porcelain= Under the auspices of the KPM workshop, porcelain figurines of many different styles have been created in the last 250 years. One of the highlights is the Prinzessinengruppe (Two Princesses), a statue based on the design by Johann Gottfried Schadow. It was created in 1795 for a double royal wedding, and is considered to be a major work of early Classicism. Animal sculptures have played a significant role throughout the history of KPM. The Berlin manufactory's works artfully illustrate nature. A clever play of light and shade, and naturalistic decoration make them appear lifelike. The numerous animal figurines continue to include designs from the manufactory's early days up to the present day. =Vases= Great artists and designers of all style periods – from Rococo to Modernism – have created high-quality vase designs for the manufactory. Many of them have become timeless design classics. Around 1820, several classicist vases were designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel like Trompetenform (trumpet shape) or Fidibus. The Halle vases made in 1931 in collaboration with Burg Giebichenstein Art School are true to the ideal of Bauhaus. Inspired by basic geometric shapes like ellipse and cone ceramic artist Friedlaender created seven harmoniously proportioned vases. The clear form of the square-shaped CADRE vase reflects one of the main requirements of the New Objectivity style that form should follow function. The 1967 design by Trude Petri is based on the tea caddy she created in 1930 for the URBINO service.

History The name \\"Burgundy\\" itself (derived from the Burgundians, an ancient Germanic tribe) is a vague term, geographically speaking. A wide number of different countries and regions throughout history have been referred to by this name or controlled by a Burgundy-based state. The most outspoken proponent of re-creating a German-controlled Burgundian state was Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. According to Himmler, Burgundy, which he called \\"an ancient economic and cultural centre\\", had been \\"reduced to nothing more than a French appendage, known only for its wine production\\". This plan entailed the transformation of Burgundy into a model-state nominally located outside of the Greater German Reich, but nevertheless ruled by a National Socialist government, and which would also have its own army, laws, and postal services. It was supposed to encompass French Switzerland (Romandy), Picardy with Amiens, the Champagne district with Reims and Troyes, the Franche-Comté with Dijon, Chalons, and Nevers, Hainaut and Luxembourg (Belgium). It was also to have a connection to both the Mediterranean Sea as well as the English Channel. The capital and administrative seat was tentatively proposed as either Dijon or Nancy (Nanzig) as its capital.Books: If Hitler Had Won. Time Magazine, Monday, Mar. 24, 1947. Its official language was to become German, but would initially be also French. Whether these were merely the dreams of Himmler personally or, as he so claimed, enjoyed Hitler’s full support is inconclusive from the historical record. Hitler's own objective towards France was to eliminate it permanently as a strategic threat to German security. The 1940 campaign in Western Europe was in fact carried out entirely so that its western flank could be secured before Germany would commit its armies to conquering Lebensraum in the Soviet Union.Norman Rich (1973). Hitler's War Aims: Ideology, the Nazi State, and the Course of Expansion. W. W. Norton & Company, New York. p. 146 With this in mind, extensive plans were made so that France could be reduced to a minor state and a permanent German vassal kept firmly in the state of dependence that she had found herself in after the 1940 armistice and which it would thus have no further reason to fear. At Hitler’s request a plan was produced after the fall of France in 1940 that would provide for the outright annexation into Germany of a large strip of Eastern France by reducing it to its late medieval borders with the Holy Roman Empire. This memo, produced by the Reich Interior Ministry forms the basis for the so-called northeast line which separated the 'forbidden zone' of German occupied France from the rest of the areas under military control.Schöttler, Peter (2003). \\"'Eine Art „Generalplan West“: Die Stuckart-Denkschrift vom 14.

Works His British Mezzotinto Portraits … with Biographical Notes (London, 1878–84, 4 pts.) consists of a full catalogue of plates executed before 1820, with 125 autotypes from plates in Smith's possession. The latter were also issued separately. This \\"remains the definitive catalogue of the subject\\".Griffiths, 138 The print-room at the British Museum contains an interleaved copy with manuscript notes. Smith was a collector of engravings, principally mezzotints, which were sold after the completion of his book in sales between 1887 and 1896. Some 300 of them, especially those by Irish printmakers, were purchased for the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin through Sir Edward Guinness, and the British Museum bought 106.Griffiths, 139 Chaloner Smith took an interest in the financial relations between England and Ireland, and published pamphlets on the subject. Just before his death he was examined before the Royal Commission which was appointed to consider the question.

Austin Bergstrom International Airport is located approximately from the proposed Central Texas Airport. Two fixed- base operators (FBOs) are located at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, and provide general aviation terminals, hangars, maintenance, and fuel facilities. The instrumented runway adjacent to both FBOs offers excellent airside access. T-Hangars at ABIA enhance general aviation facilities and provide extra shelter for 54 general aviation aircraft. With the T-hangars and tie downs, the general aviation area now contains space for about 170 small aircraft. Austin Executive Airport, a 585-acre airport, offers private and corporate pilots an alternative to ABIA and is located just a half mile from Texas 130 tollway in Northeastern Travis County. This airport is approximately from the proposed Central Texas Airport that has faced considerable community opposition. The Austin Executive Airport has been open since mid-2011 with a new runway and taxiway, a terminal, hangars huge and small and an array of other general aviation facilities. The Executive Airport is in a superior location to the planned siting of the Central Texas Airport with its own exit off of the HWY 130 Toll road, a major artery for Austin, Texas.

Archaeology of Karta =An island mystery= Kartan culture archaeology presents a puzzle, according to historian Rebe Taylor, who quotes the archaeologist Ronald Lampert: \\"The problem had all the characteristics of a classic mystery story: a large offshore island without people [today], separated .. nearly 10,000 years ago, yet with abundant evidence of human population.\\"Taylor, page 9 Indeed, Lampert called his book The great Kartan mystery.Lampert, 1981 =Heavy stone tools= James Kohen, in his book Aboriginal Environmental Impacts,Kohen 1995 describes the Aboriginal stone tool assemblage of Karta as \\"heavy core tools and pebble choppers\\".Kohen, page 44 Such Kartan tools are also, writes Kohen, found on the South Australian coast, the Flinders Ranges, and at Lime Springs in New South Wales. According to Kohen, \\"the Kartan industry consists almost exclusively of large core tools, unifacially flaked pebble tools and hammerstones\\". The tools are very heavy, averaging around 900 grams, \\"perhaps ten times the average of any other assemblage\\".Kohen, page 69 Some of the Kartan tools are \\"horsehoof\\" cores, defined by Josephine Flood as having a \\"flat base, an overhanging, step-flaked edge, and a high, domed shape like a horse's hoof\\"; their function is unexplained, and while they might have been used as choppers, they could simply be waste cores from the production of flake tools.Kohen, page 72 Over 120 Kartan sites have been found, yielding thousands of pebble choppers and hundreds of hammerstones. Most of the Kartan tools from Kangaroo island itself are composed of Quartzite brought into the sites from as far as 35 kilometres away. =Use of large game animals= Few Kartan flakes have been found, but Kohen reports one find by Draper on Kangaroo Island, in a site dated to 7000 years ago, \\"a chopper which may well have been used to butcher sea lions\\"; sea lion bones were found with the pebble tool.Mulvaney and Kamminga, page 230 However, Kohen cautions, the possible link between Kartan industry and \\"butchering of large game\\" does not prove that large animals \\"were actively hunted\\".Kohen, page 45 =Likely age= Josephine Flood, writing in her Archaeology of the Dreamtime, suggests that \\"the Kartan choppers are the earliest tools in Australia\\", most likely more than 16000 years old.Flood, page 120 References Bibliography * James L.

They were formed in order to compete at the Limerick Fleadh Cheoil. Their initial repertoire came very much from local sources, along with Galway tunes from Joe Cooley. The band won first prize at Féile Luimní the following year and made their debut radio performance broadcast in 1948. In the following decade, they competed in the All Ireland competitions, initiating a rivalry with the Kilfenora Céilí Band, which won the competition in 1954 and 1955. In 1956, Tulla tied Kilfenora for first place in the Munster competition but lost by a half point in the All Ireland. Tulla won first place the following year, however, and won again in 1960. The band toured Britain and the United States in 1958, delivering a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall in New York on St. Patrick's Day. In 2008 An Post issued a stamp featuring the band.

Her parents alleged that in order to get work in Saudi Arabia, the date of birth was altered on Nafeek's passport, and in reality she was under 18 when the offence took place; this made her execution contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Nafeek claimed that her initial confession was made under duress and without linguistic assistance. Employment in Saudi Arabia Nafeek was allegedly 17 years old when she arrived to work in Saudi Arabia on 4 May 2005. Her parents alleged that her passport was forged to adjust the year of birth to 1982, to avoid rules stopping those under the age of 18 being recruited in Sri Lanka for work abroad. She began work as a domestic helper in Dawadmi, about 400 kilometres from Riyadh. Infant's death On 22 May 2005, her employer's four-month-old child Naif al-Quthaibi died while in Nafeek's care. Nafeek was accused of murdering the child by smothering him following an argument with his mother. Nafeek claimed that she believed the baby had choked on a bottle by accident during feeding. The baby's parents and Saudi police insisted that Nafeek was guilty of murder. It was revealed that the Dawdami police failed to take the dead infant for a postmortem to determine for certain the cause of its death. Confession According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, \\"Nafeek allegedly signed a confession, but her lawyers argue that the confession was made under duress and, more importantly, Nafeek had no access to a translator during the initial questioning after she was arrested in 2005. Confessions are typically written in Arabic and signed by fingerprint.\\" Nafeek signed an affidavit on 30 January 2007 stating that the confession had been coerced: :\\"The madam came home at about 1.30 p.m. and after having seen the infant, she assaulted me with slippers and hands and took the infant away. Blood oozed from my nose. Thereafter police came and took me into their custody. I was assaulted at the police station too. They assaulted me with belt and coerced me for a statement stating that I had strangled the infant. They intimidated me that I would have been killed in the event I was adamant not to give a statement to the effect that I strangled the infant and electrocuted, I would be killed. :In these circumstances, I under duress placed my signature on the written paper they gave to me. They took me to another place and asked a question, as I was virtually in a state with loss of memory and in fear and frightened mood, I had happened to tell them that I strangled the infant. In the name of Allah, I swear and aver that I never strangled the infant.\\" Death sentence Nafeek was imprisoned and sentenced to death on 16 June 2007. The President of Sri Lanka twice personally requested a pardon for Nafeek from the King of Saudi Arabia. Human rights activists held many demonstrations calling for her release. In October 2010, according to a senior official of Sri Lanka's external affairs ministry, Charles, Prince of Wales, appealed to the Saudi King, seeking clemency for Nafeek. The Hong Kong-based Asian Human Rights Commission appealed to Queen Elizabeth II to intervene and plead for clemency for Nafeek on her diamond jubilee. Execution Nafeek was beheaded on 9 January 2013, despite an appeal from the government of Sri Lanka. =Reactions= ;Sri Lanka The Sri Lankan Parliament observed a moment of silence soon after it received the news of the execution. UNP, the main opposition party of Sri Lanka, held a special media briefing hours after the execution. In that media briefing the opposition MP Ranjan Ramanayake described the Saudi government as \\"dictators\\" and emphasized that the Saudi government never executes citizens of European or North American countries but only the citizens from Asian and African countries. ;The United Nations UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, United Nations independent experts and the world body’s human rights office voiced their dismay over the execution of Nafeek. Rupert Colville, a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in Geneva, \\"We are deeply troubled by reports of irregularities in her detention and trial, including that no lawyer was present to assist her in key stages of her interrogation and trial, that language interpretation was poor, and Ms. Nafeek’s contention that she was physically assaulted and forced to sign a confession under duress\\". The Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan Méndez, noted that during the appeal of the case, the defence submitted that Nafeek was beaten and made to sign a confession under duress. \\"Her execution is clearly contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture,\\" he said. ;The European Union The European Union expressed dismay that Saudi Arabia had beheaded Nafeek despite repeated appeals for a stay of execution. ;Asian Human Rights Commission In a letter to the UN High Commissioner and the President of Sri Lanka, the Asian Human Rights Commission said that Nafeek's execution was \\"nothing less than murder\\". ;France France condemned the execution of Nafeek and released a statement, \\"France condemns the beheading on January 9 in Saudi Arabia of Rizana Nafeek, a young Sri Lankan citizen, who was a minor when the crime occurred. As Mr. Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs, reaffirmed, France expresses its firm and constant opposition to the death penalty everywhere and under all circumstances. It urges Saudi Arabia to put an end to the executions and to establish a moratorium. ;Britain Commenting on Nafeek's execution, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt said, \\"I condemn the execution of Rizana Nafeek in Saudi Arabia yesterday, despite the many appeals for her sentence to be commuted. The UK opposes all use of the death penalty as a matter of principle, whatever the crime committed. The beheading of Ms Nafeek is particularly concerning as reports suggest she may have been a child of 17 at the time the crime was committed. We also find the practice of beheading to be particularly cruel and inhuman. We continue to raise our concerns about human rights with the Saudi authorities, including its frequent use of the death penalty\\". =Saudi Government's response= The Saudi Government stated that the statements made by various organizations were not true and that she was given a proper trial. After the verdict, there were attempts by the government to obtain pardon from the baby’s parents but they failed. =Offer of cash to the family= Nafeek's mother rejected offers of cash up to $16,000 from Saudis.

A native of the state of New York, he traveled to the West Coast during the California Gold Rush and settled in Nevada's Eagle Valley, where Carson City was established. Curry served as an assemblyman of the Nevada Territorial Legislature from 1862 to 1863 and was a territorial senator from 1863 to 1864. He was also the first superintendent of the Carson City Mint and the first warden of Nevada State Prison. Curry donated of land for the site of the Nevada State Capitol, for which the state prison quarry provided the stone for its construction. Curry spent the final years of his life building facilities for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad in Carson City. Though he had achieved prominence in Nevada, his wife claimed that he had only one dollar in his pocket when he died in 1873. Biography Abraham Van Santvoord Curry was born on February 19, 1815, in the hamlet of South Trenton, New York. He was the first son of Campbell Curry and Elvira Skinner Curry, who were married in South Trenton. On August 1, 1835, Curry married Mary Ann Cowen, who was then eighteen years old, in Ogdensburg, New York. Their first child and only son, Charles A. Curry, was born on June 10, 1836. After a year in Ogdensburg, the family moved several times and settled in Portage, Ohio, in 1848. The Currys later had six daughters. By 1852, Curry was working in Cleveland, Ohio, as a commercial merchant and later became an agent for the Michigan Southern Railroad. =Travel to the West= After his daughters, Elvira and Jane, were each married, Curry and his son Charles took a steamship from New York City that sailed around Cape Horn to San Francisco between 1854 and 1855. In 1856, the two were in the mining town of Red Dog, where Curry opened a bowling alley and established the first branch \\"tribe\\" of the Improved Order of Red Men in California. He met future business partners Benjamin F. Green, John J. Musser, and Francis \\"Frank\\" Marion Proctor in the nearby town of Downieville. =Settlement in Nevada= In 1858, Curry traveled by stagecoach with Green, Musser, and Proctor, from California to the town of Genoa after news had spread that the western part of Utah Territory had been abandoned by Mormon settlers returning to Salt Lake City because of the Utah War. Curry's $1000 offer to buy a corner lot on which build a store in Genoa was refused for being insufficient. After finding real estate in Genoa to be expensive, Curry moved on to the more sparsely inhabited Eagle Valley. Curry partnered with Musser and Proctor to purchase the Eagle Ranch trading post and 865 acres of the surrounding valley for a down payment of $300 in coins out of a total sale price of $1,000. Musser and Proctor, who were both attorneys, worked to carve a separate territory from Utah, while Curry promoted the newly founded Carson City. Curry set aside and donated of land for the site of the Nevada State Capitol. In July 1859, Musser became president and Proctor became vice- president of the constitutional convention to establish the Territory of Nevada. Curry served as the delegate from Eagle Valley. In 1859, the discovery of the Comstock Lode east of Carson City was made public, bringing tens of thousands of miners into the area. In 1861, Curry built a 100-foot stone hotel on top of warm springs about two miles east of the city center. A large wooden eagle was placed on the top of the hotel. Curry donated the site upon which the Nevada State Capitol was built. In 1862, the Nevada Territorial Legislature leased the Warm Springs Hotel from Curry to hold meetings and detain prisoners. The legislature had been using the prison quarry to provide stone material for the Nevada State Capitol while keeping costs down. In 1864, the territorial legislature paid $80,000 to acquire the hotel along with 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land from Curry, who was appointed the first warden of the facility that would become known as Nevada State Prison. In October of that year, Nevada became a state and the newly written constitution established the Lieutenant Governor of Nevada as the ex officio warden of the prison. In 1865, the United States Congress approved the establishment of a branch of the United States Mint in Carson City. Curry was named one of the planning commissioners and became the first superintendent when the Carson City Mint began operating in 1870. Later that year, Curry left the Mint to accept a commission to supervise the building of an engine house and machine shop for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Construction began in 1872 with stone provided by the prison quarry. Following its completion on July 4, 1873, the engine house hosted a celebratory grand ball. The Central Pacific Railroad stated that the shops built in Carson City equaled or exceeded their own locomotive facilities in Sacramento, California. In 1871, Curry had also designed and built a home for his family in Carson City, where he would spend the last two years of his life. =Death and legacy= Curry was the first superintendent of the Carson City Mint. Three months after the completion of the railroad project, Curry died of a stroke on October 19, 1873. In homage to its first superintendent, the Carson City Mint was closed that day. He was buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery in the largest funeral ever held in Carson City. A popular legend recounts that he had left only one silver dollar in his pocket for his wife Mary at the time of his death. Abraham Curry's house was passed down to his daughter Elvira, who in turn passed it on to her son W. H. Cowan, in 1902. The house remained in the family until 1919, and is presently used as a private law office. The house is reportedly haunted by his spirit. Abraham Curry's funeral procession has been reenacted as part of Carson City's annual Ghost Walk event, which is traditionally held during the weekend before Halloween and Nevada Day. Curry was portrayed by the actor Mark Bennett in the 1956 episode, \\"The Man Who'd Bet on Anything\\" on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews.

Mainly staffed by ex-political prisoners, its main aims are to provide assistance for other Burmese political prisoners (those in prison and those who have been released), and to document news related to them. Its stated aims are “collecting information about political prisoners and prison conditions” and “giving assistance to political prisoners and their families, for example by providing food and medicines, or financial help to enable families to visit their loved ones in prison”. History AAPP was founded in the Thai-Burma border town of Mae Sot by on 23 March 2000, the anniversary of the arrest of 1988 student leader Min Ko Naing. Since then, the organization has been run by former political prisoners, with an office and museum dedicated to political prisoners, opening inside Burma in Rangoon 2012. A larger office and museum was opened inside Rangoon in March 2018. A smaller office and museum is also located in Mae Sot, Thailand. Political prisoners in Burma Freedom of expression is heavily curtailed with the arbitrary use of laws such as the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and high treason. There were 2,203 political prisoners in jails across Burma, including monks, students, elected members of parliament and lawyers during SPDC regime. Many had been convicted for expressing views different from the government or for taking part in protests peacefully. As of June 2018, there are currently 245 political prisoners https://twitter.com/aapp_burma/status/1014796902431248384 =Treatment of political prisoners in prison= Democracy activists have reported undergoing torture, including electric shocks, rape, iron rods rubbed on their shins until the flesh rubs off, severe beatings and solitary confinement. In 2007, AAPP reported how prison hospitals become distribution centres for HIV/AIDS as prison patients were made to share needles and syringes for injections. =Treatment of political prisoners after release= Even after political prisoners are released, they continue to face ill treatment. The military intimidates and harasses ex-political prisoners in order to prevent them from participating political activities. Such activities are intensified closer to or on politically sensitive occasions, such as the anniversary of the 8888 Popular Uprising, where former political prisoners are arrested, interrogated and detained without reason. The military regime also attempts to isolate ex-political prisoners from society, for example by denying them economic and educational opportunities. Other organisations that have been campaigning for political prisoners include Burma Campaign UK, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International UK. Work =Research and Documentation = Every month a chronology documenting ongoing human rights violations in Burma is published. The chronology entails a comprehensive list of those people awaiting trial for their political activities, updating monthly figures detailing the arrests, sentences, and releases of political activists, and reporting on those who are in poor health. The publication of our monthly chronology is catalogued from different media outlets and AAPP sources within Burma and provides a general overview of the current situation in Burma each month. A thematic month in review is also released, providing an in-depth look into events of the previous month. The team also publishes research papers that outline key areas of concern for political prisoners inside Burma, as well as reports used to lobby against the government and build support amongst a network of human rights organizations. AAPP offers a reliable source of information and gives valuable advice and opinions to international researchers, advisers, organizations and journalists working on the protection of human rights in Burma. =Direct assistance for political prisoners= AAPP has been providing help to political prisoners, including emergency assistance for those with serious health problems. It has also given financial help to pay for the education of political prisoners’ children, and has helped to meet the costs of medical care for former political prisoners. =Campaigns= In 2009, AAPP collaborated with Forum for Democracy in Burma in a campaign Free Burma’s Political Prisoners Now. The campaign, which started 13 March 2009, called for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to prioritise securing the release of all Burma's political prisoners. On 15 June 2009, 677,254 signatures were personally delivered to Ban Ki-moon's office by a delegation of former political prisoners, human rights activists and family members of political prisoners. This was termed \\"the largest coordinated global action for Burma to date\\". Recent campaigns have included World Torture Day, International Women’s Day, Nelson Mandela International Day and Blue Shirt day in honour of former political prisoner U Win Tin =Museums= AAPP has two small museums dedicated to remembering the sacrifices political prisoners have made in their fight for a free, democratic Burma. There is one museum in Rangoon, Burma the other is in Mae Sot, Thailand. The museum houses a number of artifacts relating to political prisoners in Burma, including: photographs; prisoner records; a scale model of Insein prison; a replica prison cell; and items made and used by political activists in prison. The museum is free of charge, though in groups please make an appointment on the website. Recently AAPP launched a virtual museum tour, please find link here =Mental Health Assistance Programme= In 2011, AAPP started its Mental Health Assistance Programme, with the aim to build trust, improve, and raise awareness of mental health, and encourage participation in human rights promotion and the national reconciliation process. The programme started in Mae Sot, Thailand and expanded into Burma in 2013. to date, MHAP operates in 7 States within Burma and also in Mae Sot. In October 2019 MHAP release its inaugural report on Treating Common Mental Health Disorders in Burma and the need for Comprehensive Mental Health Policies During the COVID-19 period AAPP's MHAP gave self-care and mental empowerment talks to people in quarantine centers and those volunteering to help alleviate the mental and economic stress, using the experience of political prisoners and their family members Publications AAPP releases thematic reports regularly exploring the pressing civil and political issues facing Burma during its democratic transition.

Goossen was born in Maracaibo to Dutch parents. He followed his studies at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam (1956–1961), and achieved an architecture bachelor's degree at the Heald College of Engineering of San Francisco (1965–1967). In addition he received several stipendia to travel abroad (Maison Descartes Paris 1961-2, finalist Zellerbach competition San Francisco 1965, Stipendium C.R.M. 1973, and travel grant 1978). During his training period, he specialised as sculptor, designer and draftsman.Jacobs, P.M.J. Beeldend Nederland: biografisch handboek {2}, Tilburg: P.M.J. Jacobs, 1993, pp. 401-2 Goossen’s work can be defined as non-figurative, geometric and abstract, with a focus on people and their relationship with the industrial world. As a result, the pieces display always intricate plays of horizontal and vertical lines, which create spatial tissues where the light penetrates. All these angularities are emphasized by the hard colours like bright red that Goossen uses.Van der Burgt, Anna. \\"Goossen en het monument bij de Maasbrug\\", Expositie bij Galerie Tegenbosch Heusden, Brabants Dagblad, (17/07/1994) The sculptures from Goossen, Jan can be seen in the Netherlands and in the United States. His first assignment was a relief at the Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco (1966), and next in the same city a sculptural wall in the Golden Gate Center (1967). Back in the Netherlands, he worked for the aged care home of Blaricum and for the Shell-laboratorium of Rijswijk (1969). After finishing a commission for Lisse (1970), he produced one of the most controversial of his pieces: the sculpture at the Spui 'Piramide' (1976). The pyramidal shape of the piece looked for providing the walker with a roof under which sit down and rest, but the aesthetic of the piece led to discontent in the neighbourhood and it was finally re-placed to the outskirts of the city (1987) to the Gaasperplaspark. More assignments succeeded (Gemeente, Amsterdam, 1972; Royal Building Service, Zuidwolde, 1974),'East Jesus County Revisited' next to the Ir. Otten bad in Eindhoven (1975), 'Septum, in gesprek met de vorigen' Stadswandelpark Eindhoven (1982),'Running Squares' for Rosmalen (1988).

Edward Francis Burney (1760–1848) was an English artist. His middle name is sometimes given as \\"Francisco\\" or \\"Francesco\\". Life Burney was born in Worcester on 7 September 1760, the son of Richard Burney and Elizabeth Humphries. The musicologist Charles Burney was his uncle and the writer Frances (or \\"Fanny\\") Burney was his cousin. He studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1776, where he received encouragement from Sir Joshua Reynolds. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1780 until 1803. His work included historical subjects and portraits of friends and family. A portrait of his cousin Frances was engraved as a frontispiece to her works, and in 1780 he exhibited three drawings illustrating her novel Evelina, which were engraved for a 1791 edition of the work. Much of his work was done for book illustrations, including a series for an edition of Milton's Paradise Lost.

Satirical works In the 1820s Burney painted four large watercolours satirising contemporary musical and social life: The Waltz, The Elegant Establishment for Young Ladies (both Victoria and Albert Museum), Amateurs of Tye-Wig Music and The Glee Club; or, The Triumph of Music (both Yale Center for British Art), possibly with the intention of publishing prints after them. They were never engraved, but he did work up Amateurs of Tye-Wig Music into an oil painting, now in the collection of the Tate Gallery. The picture draws on the debate over the relative virtues of modern music (exemplified by Beethoven and Mozart) as against that of earlier composers, such as Handel, whose bust overlooks the ramshackle band of musicians in the painting, and Corelli, one of whose pieces they are playing. Burney's uncle Charles took a leading part in the argument, on the side of the modernists. Death Burney died in London on 16 December 1848, at the age of 88. He never married.

(Manteo) The Secotans were one of several groups of American Indians dominant in the Carolina sound region, between 1584 and 1590, with which English colonizers had varying degrees of contact. Secotan villages included the Secotan, Aquascogoc, Dasamongueponke, Pomeiock (Pamlico) and Roanoac. Other local groups included the Chowanoke (including village Moratuc), Weapemeoc, Chesapeake, Ponouike, Neusiok, and Mangoak (Tuscarora), and all resided along the banks of the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds.Names of geographic features and Native American groups have changed over time. The English knew the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds as the Roanoke Sea. The English knew the location of the Mangoaks, but according to the depositions collected from 1707-1711, the Tuscarora initiated the sale of the same lands to the Weapemeoc in 1645. This provides evidence f. Huhyhurfthat the Tuscarora and Mangoak existed as names for the same group of people. Many commonly used tribe names actually refer to individual villages, which existed within tribes. The Secotan tribal area included the villages of both Roanoke and Croatan, though many sources inaccurately refer to theses villages as separate Native American groups. Bernard G. Hoffman, \\"Ancient Tribes Revisited: A summary of Indian distribution and movement in the North Eastern United States from 1534 to 1779, Parts I-III.\\" Ethnohistory, 14, no. 1 / 2 (1967): 30. They spoke Carolina Algonquian language, an Eastern Algonquian language.  Background  In the Carolinas, colonization did not exist as a straight-line transition, from Native American to European rule. A rivalry marked the relationship between the two European powers, the English and the Spanish. Rivalries also existed between the Native American groups. Additionally, the Europeans often found themselves caught in the middle of conflicts, which existed between Native American groups. Each group, European or Native American placed the interest of their group over the interest of all others. The English, the Spanish, and the Native American groups they had contact with each acted against the others, as counter-colonizers of the Carolinas as exhibited through the study of Roanoke Island. In 1490, prior to England's entry into North American colonialism, the Treaty of Medina del Campo lowered tariffs between England and Spain, and ushered in an era of increased trading between the two countries. The marriage of Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon (Spain) sealed the treaty. During this time, many English traders moved to southern Spain, in the area of Andalusia, and trade flourished. In 1533, Spanish officials began to harass the English in Spain, who were required as Englishmen to \\"swear under oath\\" that Henry VIII was the head of the church. The requirement of the oath made the Englishmen in Spain subject to persecution, under charges of heresy, by the Spanish Inquisition.Paul E. Hoffman, Spain and the Roanoke Voyages (Raleigh: Division of Archives and History; North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, 1987), 18-19. To circumvent Spanish officials and the inquisition, English traders devised a system, in which they would travel to Spanish possessions in the Caribbean, to pick up Spanish goods, and take them back to England, with no religious conflicts. By the 1560s, the English faced increasing Spanish hostility. In 1585, the Englishman Richard Hakluyt published a book, Discourse of Western Planting, which concluded that the English should establish their own colony in the mid-latitudes of North America, to end dependency on Spanish goods, by creating their own supply lines. By April of the same year, Sir Richard Grenville left England, bound for the Carolina coast, with 100 colonists, which marked the beginning of England's colonial endeavours in America.Paul E. Hoffman, Spain and the Roanoke Voyages, 18-19. Spanish colonies established the first European colonies in the Carolinas, under the leadership of Spanish captain, Juan Pardo, in 1567 and 1568. Pardo declared that the Catawba, Wateree, and Saxaphaw groups were subject to the Spanish crown, and he successfully persuaded the groups to construct housing and make food provisions, which created eleven Spanish settlements in the Carolinas. The Spanish still inhabited the Carolinas when the English arrived.Marion P. Blackburn, \\"Spain's Appalachian Outpost\\". Archaeology 62, no 4 (2009): 38-43. While the Spanish settled in the interior of the Carolinas, the English arrived on the coast. The placement of a colony at Roanoke marked the first English colonial presence in North America.David Stick, Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina press, 1983), 30-32.  Amadas and Barlowe, Secotans and Neiosioke  Before the English placed their first settlement on Roanoke Island, Master Philip Amadas and Master Arthur Barlowe executed an expedition on April 27, 1584, on behalf of Sir Walter Raleigh, who received an English charter, to establish a colony a month earlier. During their expedition, Barlowe took detailed notes relating to conflicts and rivalries between different groups of Native Americans.Paul E. Hoffman, Spain and the Roanoke Voyages, 26-27. In one such account, Manteo, of the Croatoan (Hatteras), explained his own tribal history, in relation to a neighboring tribe at the mouth of the Neuse River, the Neusiok, referred to as the Neiosioke by Barlowe. According to Manteo, the Croatoan endured years of warfare with the Neiosioke, and \\"some years earlier,\\" he met with the Neiosioke king, in an effort to ensure a \\"permanent coexistence.\\" The two leaders arranged a feast between the two groups. An unspecified number of Neiosioke men and thirty women attended a feast in the town of Croatoan. The Neiosioke executed an ambush on the Secotans at the feast, and by the time fighting ended, the Neiosioke had \\"slewn them every one, reserving the women and children only.\\"Stick, Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America, 36, 42, 50-51. In conveying this \\"inter-tribal\\" history to Barlowe, Manteo saw an opportunity to advance the interest of the Croatoan. Manteo and his people attempted on several occasions to convince the English to join them in devising a surprise attack against the Neiosioke. The Englishmen, uncertain of \\"whether their perswasion be to the ende they may be revenged of their enemies, or for the love they beare to us,\\" declined to help the Croatoan wage war against their rivals. Instead, the English established a trusting relationship with the Croatoan, exemplified by the willingness of two Croatoan men, Manteo and Wanchese, to accompany Amadas and Barlowe back to England.Stick, Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America, 51-52.''' Later records Distribution of Carolina Algonquian speaking peoples 1657-1795 The Secotan remained in the same area until 1644-5, when they were attacked and driven off by colonists from Virginia Colony during the last of the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. English settlement in the area began to increase soon afterwards, and it was officially transferred from Virginia Colony to the Province of Carolina in 1665. In latter years Secotans were recorded under the name Machapunga.Karen Ordahl Kupperman, Roanoke: The Abandoned Colony See also *Algonquian languages *Algonquian peoples *Aquascogoc *Carolina Algonquian *Chowanoke *Chesapeake (tribe) *Dasamongueponke Notes External links * Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony, Lee Miller * Roanoke: The Abandoned Colony, Second Edition, Karen Ordahl Kupperman * Map of Virginia colony 1585. and Secotan territory References *Miller, Lee. \\"Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony\\".

It is located in the northern part of St. Anne, and operates as part of the States of Guernsey Health and Social Services Department. The hospital was established in 2008 and has 22 beds, serving Alderney’s population of 2,300. 14 beds are used for continuing care; 8 of the beds are used for medical, post-operative, maternity or paediatric care. Layout The hospital complex was developed in two phases. In the first phase of construction, which replaced an old temporary structure built in 1960s, was the ward complex with 14 single rooms, two maternity wards and two examination rooms. This phase was completed in May 2007 and a formal inauguration was graced by The Princess Royal. The BBC gave coverage to the new hospital prior to its inauguration. Soon thereafter, the second phase which involved construction of five intensive care wards and outpatient services with an additional entrance was also completed in 2008. Modern equipment It has a modern X-ray unit. A diagnostic instrument manufactured and supplied by Siemens Health care to the hospital is the \\"MULTIX TOP analogue X-ray system\\". This radiographic system replaced an older version, which was in use in the hospital for 14 years. The new X-ray equipment has enhanced the capability of the hospital in radiography by providing superior quality of images and total manoeuvrability of the equipment. The advantage of this instrument is stated to be “the ergonomic design of the ceiling-mounted X-ray system, which enables radiographers to access patients from all sides of the table.” Services Residents of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm or Jethou paying Social Security contributions are covered by the Specialist Health Insurance Scheme and so may receive specialist care and treatment free of charge at the hospital. Patients from countries with a reciprocal health agreement with Guernsey are exempt from charges. Alderney residents may choose to be treated privately at the hospital. The hospital has two GPs and occasional visiting specialists who hold out-patient clinics, especially from the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey which acts as a parent institution to the Mignot Memorial Hospital of Alderney. The hospital has a 24-hour accident and emergency clinic, a physiotherapy department and a small radiography unit. Women giving birth to children in Alderney are generally taken to Guernsey. Legal amendment Subsequent to the opening of the new hospital in Alderney, legal amendments have been issued with changes made in the rules existing since 1997. An Ordinance titled “the Health Service (Alderney Hospital Benefit) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2008” has been issued with modifications in “paragraph 3(a), for the definition of \\"the Alderney hospital contract\\", as inserted in section 39(1) of the Law of 1990 by the Ordinance of 1997” substituted by \\"the Alderney hospital contract\\" means any agreement, for the time being in force, for the provision of Alderney hospital benefit at the Mignot Memorial Hospital, Alderney, made between the States of Guernsey and a supplier of medical care services approved for the purposes by the States Health and Social Services Department;\\" with additional provisions related to nursing.

Playing career Sanders played as a defensive back for the University of Nebraska–Lincoln from 1985 through 1989, earning a letter in each of his last three years. He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. Coaching career Sanders began his football coaching career as an assistant coach for Nebraska Wesleyan University just two years after he graduated from Nebraska, putting in two years as the Secondary Coach for the Prairie Wolves football team. He was appointed to continue as a Secondary Coach as well as Sports Information Director for the University of Minnesota Morris in Morris, Minnesota for the 1994 season, and then returned to the State of Nebraska as the Secondary Coach for the Mavericks at the University of Nebraska at Omaha for 1995. UNO promoted Sanders to Defensive Coordinator in 1997. During his five-year tenure with the Mavericks, the team won two North Central Conference championships, and made two appearances in the NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs. Sanders was hired into his first Division I-A football coaching position in 2000, when he was named by New Mexico State University Head Football Coach and fellow Nebraska alum Tony Samuel as the Defensive Ends and Outside Linebackers Coach for the Aggies. The following season, Colorado State University Head Football Coach Sonny Lubick named Sanders as the Secondary Coach for the Rams. The Rams went 7-5 in 2001, and defeated North Texas in the 2001 New Orleans Bowl. The 2002 season saw an improvement to 10-4 and a Mountain West Conference championship, though the Rams ended the season with a 3-17 loss to in the . =Nebraska under Frank Solich= Nebraska Head Football Coach Frank Solich brought Sanders back to Lincoln in 2003 amidst a staff shakeup following the Cornhuskers' first non- winning season since 1961. Sanders was now in charge of the defensive backs at Nebraska, where 47 takeaways on the season set a new school record, and the Nebraska Blackshirts set new school and league records with 32 interceptions, the nation's highest-ranked pass efficiency defense, and the nation's second- best scoring defense. Despite the turnaround, Solich was fired after finishing the regular season 9-3. Nebraska Defensive Coordinator Bo Pelini subsequently led the team to a 17-3 victory over Michigan State in the 2003 Alamo Bowl to finish the team's season at 10-3, but he and Sanders, along with nearly all of the remaining staff, were let go after Bill Callahan was appointed as Nebraska's 31st Head Football Coach. =North Carolina= Sanders was named as co-Defensive Coordinator and Defensive Backs Coach at the struggling North Carolina for 2004. After finishing just 2-10 in 2003 before his arrival, Sanders helped the Tar Heels improve to a 6-6 (5-3 ACC) record and posting the lowest yards allowed by a UNC defense in three years. Under Sanders direction, UNC improved over 60 spots nationally in total defense. UNC Head Football Coach John Bunting was fired halfway through the 2006 season, and replaced by Butch Davis for 2007. Davis did not retain Sanders in his new staff. =Nebraska under Bo Pelini= After a one-year absence from coaching, Sanders was again brought back to Nebraska following the firing of Bill Callahan after a four-year record of 27-22. Callahan's replacement was former Nebraska Defensive Coordinator Bo Pelini, who had also been let go along with most of Frank Solich's staff after 2003. Pelini installed Sanders as the Secondary Coach for the Cornhuskers as part of his effort to turn around a program that had struggled under Callahan. Nebraska's Blackshirts defense improved to rank as the second best in the Big 12 Conference in 2008 after languishing near the bottom of the pack nationally in the years prior. In 2009, two of Sanders' players were named to the All-Big 12 first team, and the Nebraska secondary was among the highest ranked in the nation with the highest-rated pass defense and highest-rated scoring defense, and among the top ten nationally in rushing defense, sacks, and total defense. The 2009 Nebraska secondary intercepted 18 times while only allowing seven touchdown passes all season. Sanders resigned from Nebraska on February 3, 2011, citing personal and family reasons. =USC Trojans= After agreeing to be FAU's defensive coordinator under new head coach Carl Pelini (Bo's brother) on December 5, 2011, Sanders left to become the USC Trojans defensive backs coach on February 12, 2012 under head coach Lane Kiffin. USC had gone through the whole 2011 season without a defensive backs coach as former coach Willie Mack Garza left days before the season opened stemming from his connection to Willie Lyles while at Tennessee. Sanders was the first coach hired by Pelini, as the Owls defensive coordinator. As per USC policy being a private school, Sanders financial agreement was not released. Pelini praised Sanders when he announced the hiring, saying they shared the same philosophy and that he had been the only candidate for the job. Sanders was relieved of his duties at USC after the school hired Clancy Pendergast to be their defensive coordinator. =Loyola= Sanders was officially hired as the head coach of one of the top high school football programs in the state of California, Loyola High School of Los Angeles, on February 24, 2013. In four years, he accumulated a 20–22 record and 1–1 in the CIF Division 1 playoffs. Prior to the 2017 season, Loyola and the Los Angeles Times announced Sanders would not return to lead the Cubs' football program as the head coach. =Dallas Renegades= After one season as defensive coordinator of the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers football team, Sanders joined the XFL's Dallas Renegades in 2019 as defensive backs coach.

William Young Ottley (6 August 1771 - 26 May 1836) was a British collector of and writer on art, amateur artist, and Keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. He was an early English enthusiast for 14th- and 15th-century Italian art, or the \\"Italian Primitives\\" as they were then often called. He spent the 1790s based in Rome, where he bought much art; this was sold for a considerable profit in 1801 after his return to London. Life He was born near Thatcham, Berkshire, the son of an officer in the Guards. He became a pupil of George Cuitt the Elder, and studied in the Royal Academy of Arts Schools. In 1791 he went to Italy, and stayed there ten years, studying art and collecting pictures, drawings, and prints, profiting from the turmoil of the French invasion. On his return to England he raised large sums by auctioning his 16th- and 17th-century paintings at Christie's in May 1801 (the lots and prices are listed by Buchanan),Buchanan, Memoirs of painting but the earlier works would at that time have found little or no market in England. He became an arbiter of taste, and assisted collectors in the purchase of works of art and the formation of picture galleries. His own collection of drawings by Italian Old Masters he sold to Sir Thomas Lawrence, a close friend,Griffiths, 93 for £8,000, and his print collection was also very fine. Paintings in his collection included The Mystical Nativity by Botticelli and Raphael's Vision of a Knight, both now in the National Gallery. In 1808 and 1812 he was living at No.43, Frith Street, Soho, London, and by 1818 in Kensington.British Museum collections database. enter the name He had one son, Henry Ottley, who died in Torquay (d. 3 February 1878).'Obituary', The Art Journal, May 1878, p. 124. In 1833 Ottley exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art, London an unfinished drawing of The Battle of the Angels. In the same year he was appointed Keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum, a post he retained till his death in 1836. Some drawings are in the British Museum, which also has catalogues of two sales of his pictures, in 1811 and 1837. Works Prospero Summoning Ariel, drawing by Ottley, c. 1800 Ottley was significant in his day as a writer on art, and for the series of illustrated works which he published. He began in 1805 with the first part of The Italian School of Design, a series of etchings by himself, after drawings by the old masters. The second part was published in 1813 and the third in 1823, when the whole work was issued in one volume. In 1816 he published an Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of Engraving on Copper and Wood, which was followed by four folio volumes of engravings of The Stafford Gallery. In 1826 came out A Series of Plates after the Early Florentine Artists. Two volumes followed in 1826–28 of facsimiles, by himself, of prints and etchings by masters of the Italian and other schools. In 1831 he published Notices of Engravers and their Works which was the start of a dictionary of artists, which he decided not to continue; and in 1863, after his death, appeared An Inquiry into the Invention of Printing, a companion to his work on the origin of engraving. Besides these works, he published in 1801 a catalogue of Italian pictures, which he had acquired during his stay in Italy from the Colonna, Borghese, and Corsini Palaces; A Descriptive Catalogue of the Pictures in the National Gallery, 1826; and Observations on a MS. in the British Museum, in a controversy concerning Cicero's translation of an astronomical poem by Aratus.

The building was constructed for use as a meeting place for local Christians affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren movement. History A group of around eight individuals who had seceded from the Quakers met in the house of a Mrs Sands in Stoney SouthBritish History Online (now Stoneleigh Road) from 1838, and the Brooks Street Meeting House was constructed and opened in 1839.Street Chapel website Prominent amongst the original members were the chemist John Eliot Howard and his brother Robert, and some funding was also provided by their father, the meteorologist Luke Howard, who moved to Tottenham shortly after.\\"Malaria chemist's legacy celebrated outside his former home\\". Haringey Independent, 3 August 2010 The Howards are commemorated in Tottenham by a blue plaque to Luke at 7, Bruce Grove,Open Plaque #190 and a green plaque to John on the site of his home, Lord's Meade (now Lordship Lane). As the population of Tottenham grew throughout the nineteenth century, the assembly of Christians also grew rapidly to around 88 by 1842Precious Seed magazine and around 140 in 1851. Work with local children was a major concern, with a Sunday School of an estimated 600 children at the turn of the twentieth century. The Meeting House, now known as Brook Street Chapel was given over entirely for children's work, and all other assembly meetings were held between 1880 and 1903 in lecture rooms on the opposite side of the High Road. The Chapel building was extended in 1939 and again in 1955 to include a schoolroom and a rear hall for youth work. The building in its present state occupies the whole of Brook Street, after World War II bombing destroyed the houses in the further part of the road. =The Tottenham Memorandum= Displayed in the Chapel is the Tottenham Memorandum, which was produced at the time of the division of the movement into open and exclusive factions – the Memorandum shows that Brook Street Chapel remained 'open', receiving any Christians into fellowship who were born-again believers in Jesus Christ, providing their confession of faith could be demonstrated. Individuals associated with the assembly Apart from the Howards, other notable members of the assembly included James Von Summer, founder of the Echoes of Service magazine and Edmund Gosse, who taught in the Sunday School. Christians who taught or visited include John Nelson Darby, Anthony Norris Groves, George Müller, James Hudson Taylor, Thomas Barnardo, Philip Gosse (Edmund's father, and a noted naturalist) and his wife Emily Bowes, who were married at the chapel in 1848.Gosse, Edmund , Father and Son (Oxford University Press, 2004), 208. Geography The chapel was built when Tottenham was a wealthy suburb of London and, like the Plough public house next to it, was set back from Tottenham High Road. Since then, the double front of the chapel has been partially obscured by new buildings (now housing Ladbrokes bookmakers), so that the building appears hidden from the High Road (now the A10), giving it the nickname of \\"the hidden church\\".Tottenham Civic Society 2010 The land to the south of the chapel was originally the Chapel's burial ground.

Demographics  According to Ottoman statistics, the village had 449 inhabitants in 1895.Μιχάλης Κοκολάκης, \\"Η τουρκική στατιστική της Ηπείρου στο Σαλναμέ του 1895\\" στο Βασίλης Παναγιωτόπουλος, Λεωνίδας Καλλιβρετάκης, Δημήτρης Δημητρόπουλος, Μιχάλης Κοκολάκης και Ευδοκία Ολυμπίτου (επιμ.), Πληθυσμοί και οικισμοί του ελληνικού χώρου.

The village today has a permanent population of roughly 500 inhabitants, notably due to migration to Greece or other countries. Despite this, the population doubles in Easter, Summer and Christmas, as most people return to their village to celebrate or have holidays with their families. Location The village Jorgucat is one of the main settlements in the southern part of Dropull valley. It's located between the villages of Zervat to the south and Grapsh to the north. Jorgucat is situated at a cross-road which joins Ioannina, Gjirokastër and Sarandë.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 77 Name The village received its name Jorgucat (Georgoutsates) as the result of the conversion of a surname to a toponym. In particurlar the name Georgoutsates applies to the descendants of a certain Georgoutsos. History According to a local tradition Jorgucat was once called Gonates, a village mentioned in the Chronicle of Gjirokastër during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Alexios Komnenos (11th century). However, this theory remains disputed. Other accounts claim that the foundation of the settlement dates back to the first years of Ottoman rule (15th century). The village under its current name is recorded in an Ottoman document of 1520. That year it consisted of 62 households.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 78 Jorgucat suffered dramatic population decline from the 17th to the first half of the 19th century.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 80 Monastery of Prophet Elias The Monastery of the Prophet Elias next to the village is situated on a natural elevation in the mountain range of Mali i Gjerë named Hilomodhi, on the Marantoraq peak. According to a local tradition the monastery was founded in the 12th century, supposedly built by giants. Documentary and architectural evidence, however, supports that the year of its foundation was 1545. The monastery was repaired and enlarged several times between the 17th and 19th centuries. In the 20th century it was closed down by the authorities of the Albanian state.Giakoumis, 2002, p. 126  Notable individuals  *Kosmas Thesprotos (c. 1780-1852), Greek scholar, priest and theologian.

Located in the Old School House on the High Street in central St Anne, the museum is run and funded by the Alderney Society as one of its many projects. The museum is made up of five gallery spaces: the Main Gallery, the Issue Room of 1946, The Natural History Room, The Maritime Gallery and the upstairs Temporary Exhibition Gallery. The museum exhibits fully trace the history of the island from the Stone Age through to modern day. The museum acts as an object store, an island archive and a public access museum and the collection is therefore broad. Included in the museum collection are rare island maps, plans and charts, lists of British Regiments stationed in Alderney since 1732, old court records, the 1940 Census of Alderney, and many rare artefacts. Exhibitions in the museum are varied with recent temporary exhibition including Andy Goldsworthy's Alderney Stones Project, the 1850 sketches of Sophia Guille and plans from the National Archives Kew of the Victorian fortifications in Alderney. The Alderney Society Museum also collaborates with other museums in loaning exhibits. One recent example included the June 2009 through December 2009 loan of pieces from the Alderney Elizabethan Shipwreck, such as cannonballs, breastplate, helmet, and tobacco pipes, to the Guernsey Museums & Galleries in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey. History The museum is housed in the Old School House, next to the old church of St. Anne which is not in use. It adjoins the oldest island cemetery where the old clock tower can be seen at the museum entrance. A plaque on the wall above the entrance states in French that the public school was built and founded by Jean Le Mesurier, governor of the island in 1790. Outside the museum is an old yellow telephone box and post box. The museum is administered by the Alderney Society who established the museum in 1966 with the purpose of creating \\"an organisation dedicated to the historical, environmental and scientific promotion of the Island of Alderney\\". It was first opened in the basement of the Island Hall, however this location proved unsuitable for the type and quantity of objects and papers donated to the museum, the States of Alderney offered the use of the old St. Anne's Public School building for what is termed as a \\"peppercorn rent\\", since there was dearth of funds to meet expenses for running a museum. Volunteers pitched in to refurbish the new museum premises for the formal opening held in 1970. In 1993, the museum was officially fully registered with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and in 1999 the museum was a recipient of the Museums and Galleries’ Gulbenkian Award for \\"most outstanding achievement\\" presented by Prince Charles. Today the museum has achieved full accreditation by the MLA. Holdings The museum has over 18,000 holdings related to the history, archaeology and natural history of Alderney. The museum displays exhibit items of social history, military history, the evacuation of the island in 1940 and the subsequent occupation by German troops. Some of the most notable items include plans and drawings of the construction of the Alderney Breakwater, built between 1847 and 1864. The 1852 George S. Reynolds' lithograph is part of the Alderney Breakwater group of documents. Holdings are as diverse as 1940 census papers, cinerary urns, dulcie cups, and curry powder bottles. There are also church and government documents, as well as land and cemetery registers. Materials that document Alderney customs, folk life, genealogy, geology, and the island's natural history are part of the holdings. One of the larger collections pertains to the Elizabethan Wreck, many artefacts from this important discovery are on display in Gallery 2.

His books and pamphlets, which presented both standard and speculative history and archaeology sold in the thousands. Although Priest appears to have been poorly educated, he attempted to portray himself as an authority in his books. Priest is often identified as one of the creators of pseudoscientific and pseudohistoric literature.Williams, Stephen. Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991 Although his work was widely read and several of his works were published in multiple editions, his books were characterized by theories that were used to justify the violent domination over both the Native American and African-American peoples. Priest's works were among the most overtly racist of his time. Priest's offensive works help set the stage for the Trail of Tears and the defense of slavery that contributed to the conflicts of the American Civil War.  Early life  Priest was born in Unadilla, New York. He grew up during a time when the United States was first establishing itself as a nation. Little specific is known about his schooling, but it is assumed that he received a basic primary and secondary education.Williams, Stephen. Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991, p. 51. At the age of 24 he married Eliza Perry from Lansingburgh, New York. After a brief period in Lansingburgh, they migrated to Albany, New York, around the year 1819. While there, Priest was first employed as a coach \\"trimmer\\" or upholsterer, He later worked in leather, mainly fashioning saddles and harnesses.Williams 1991, p.51 He and Eliza conceived and raised a total of ten children. He was reportedly well-liked by the churchgoers for his dramatic performance during the sermons, several of which were published.Sloan, De Villo. (2002), The Crimsoned Hills of Onondaga: Josiah Priest's Hallucinatory Epic,\\" Journal of Popular Culture (Bowling Green) 36(1): 86-104. Priest's fundamentalist view of Christianity and his faith in Biblical literalism are evident throughout his work. Josiah Priest knew Oliver Cowdery, who later assisted Joseph Smith, Jr., in the production of the Book of Mormon.  Writing career  Illustration from Priests 1839 book The anti-universalist, or History of the fallen angels of the scriptures: Proofs of the being of satan and of evil spirits and many other curious matters connected therewith Priest decided to give up his profession as a leather worker and become a writer. His first book, in a genre now identified as cryptozoology was The Wonders of Nature and Providence, Displayed, compiled from Authentic Sources, Both Ancient and Modern, Giving an Account of Various and Strange Phenomena Existing in Nature, of Travels, Adventures, Singular Providences, &c.; (1826). His other major publications were American Antiquities and Discoveries of the West (1833) and Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro (1843), each of which was published in multiple editions. :His writing about American prehistory—and this comment is not made entirely to be humorous—might be classified as science fiction or fantasy as well as a subgenre of American Romanticism, the elements of which are pronounced in the early products of popular culture. Winthrop Hillyer Duncan writes, “This author is thought by some to have been the creator or forerunner of the popular dime and nickel novels of the sixties, seventies and eighties.\\"Sloan 2002, p. 88 =American Antiquities (1833)= This 400-page publication centered around Priest's own study of the Bible and antiquarian journals, supplemented by information from his travels. After visiting earthworks in Ohio and New York, Priest concluded that these mounds could be traced back to a lost race that had inhabited America even before the Native Americans. This idea is now referred to as the \\"mound builder myth\\" and still has supporters in society today. The book grew in popularity because of Priest's views on Native Americans. \\"It tapped into the widely accepted view of those times that Native Americans were merely bloodthirsty savages, bent on the destruction of all but their own race. It was inconceivable to Priest and like-minded men that a race so lazy and inept could conceive and build such huge, elaborate structures.\\"Harpster, Jack; Stalter, Jeff. \\"Captive! The Story of David Ogden and the Iroquois.\\" ABC-CLIO, LLC., 2010, p. xi. Priest speculated that the original dwellers could be the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.These tribes made up the Kingdom of Israel in Biblical times. When Assyria left their kingdom in ruins, the tribes disappeared and were never seen again. The reasoning Priest gives for his conclusion that there was an even earlier settler than the Native Americans relies upon his own Biblical interpretation of the flood story. According to Josiah, after the great flood disappeared, Noah and his ark landed on America. While surveying the land, Noah also discovered mounds that had been constructed before the waters rose up. Upon seeing this, Noah questioned where these agricultural phenomena came from. \\"Surveying the various themes of mound builder origins, he could not decide whether the mounds were the work of Polynesians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Israelites, Scandinavians, Welsh, Scotts, or Chinese, although he felt certain the Indians had not built them.\\"Silverberg, Robert. \\"The Mound Builders.\\" Ohio UP, 1986, pp. 65-66, cited in De Villo Sloan, 2002. Priest's clear bias against Native Americans probably derived from stories he heard during the American Indian Wars. Immediately following the American Revolution, Native Americans who were engaged in bloody and violent battles were frequently represented by the dominant culture as savages and threats to peace. =Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro (1843)= Another work in which Priest uses Biblical interpretation as a central theme is Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro, Or African Race (1843). In this overtly racist book, Priest seeks to use references from the Bible to prove that God created black people to be slaves. Priest claims that Noah's three sons were each a different color. The black offspring was named Ham, which Priest says was a word Egyptians used to identify objects that were black. He goes on to assert that Ham was cursed from birth to be a servant. As a consequence of his sins, all his people would also suffer the fate of slavery. Priest writes, \\"The appointment of this race of men to servitude and slavery, was a judicial act of God, or in other words was a divine judgment.\\" Priest, Josiah. \\"Slavery, As It Relates to the Negro, or African Race.\\" C. Van Benthuyen & Co., 1843, p.83. Multiple revised editions of this book were republished in the 1850s under the title, Bible defence of slavery or, The origin, history, and fortunes of the Negro race. Priest provides three pieces of evidence for why the Bible justifies the enslavement of black people. He says that the blacks were created with lower intelligence and more irrational behavior than other colors of man, suiting them as servants. He cites a verse in the Book of Genesis When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.” He also said, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem. May God extend Japheth’s territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth.” that states that Ham and all of his descendants were destined to be slaves.Origin and History of the Negro Race - Fifth Section, in Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, Department of English, University of Virginia. He argues that, due to the black's inferior attributes, they possessed a need to be enslaved. His book discusses how a black man's physical stature and skin, as opposed to those of a white man, are designed to be more durable and therefore intended for hard manual labor. =Pamphlets and historical profiles= In addition to his books, Priest wrote several pamphlets focusing on heroes of the American Revolution. His narratives suggest a preoccupation with racial conflicts, since they focus mainly on soldiers who had been held in captivity by Native Americans. Frank H. Severance (1856-1931), a noted author-historian, defended Priest's style of writing, saying, \\"I'm aware that Priest is not altogether trustworthy as a historian. ... Priest is least trustworthy in his more ambitious work; whereas his unpretentious pamphlets... contain true narratives of individual undertakings in the Revolution, Indian captivities and other prisoner experiences, gathered by the writer direct from the hero whose adventures he wrote down... without apparent perversion or exaggeration.\\"Severance, Frank. Preface to his Old trails on the Niagara frontier, 1899, cited in Jack Harpster and Ken Stalter, 2010, p. xiv. Priest recorded stories of Native American atrocities against white settlers that otherwise may have been forgotten. However, his selection of stories was biased towards portrayals of Native Americans as violent. Criticisms and legacy Critics dismiss Priest's books as compilations of poorly supported theories motivated by racism. Robert Silverberg notes, \\"The argument he constructs is built on literal interpretations of Biblical passages mixed with popular pseudo- scholarly views and gross misreadings of related texts.\\"Silverberg, Robert. \\"The Mound Builders.\\" cited in De Villo Sloan, 2002. Priest was known for integrating many types of sources into his writings, seeking to create a semblance of authority and credibility for a popular audience. Priest's fantastic assertions persist today in the works of pseudoscience, pseudohistory, and New Age pop culture. In this respect, he can be considered a pioneer in popular but highly erroneous publishing. The popularity of his works allowed Americans of his time to indulge in romantic fantasies about the past that encouraged their own racism.

At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Korçë. History According to legend, the village was founded by Polish settlers left behind after a Crusade.Petiffer, James. \\"Blue Guide Albania & Kossovo\\", London, 2001. It is believed that the local church of Saint John the Forerunner was most probably built in the 13th century and it was rebuilt and expanded later.Гюзелев, Боян. Албанци в източните Балкани, София 2004, с. 34. (Gyuzelev Boyan. Albanians in the eastern Balkans, Sofia 2004, p. 34.) In 1503 a new church in the monastery St. Nicholas near to the village was built on whose western wall, in a Greek language inscription the slavic names of donors were mentioned - Bogdan, Chelko, Valcho and Telche, and the paintings were a donation of Petros Chartophylax.Giakoumis K. (2002), The Monasteries of Jorgucat and Vanishtë in Dropull and of Spelaio in Lunxhëri as Monuments and Institutions During the Ottoman Period in Albania (16th-19th Centuries), Doctoral thesis submitted at the Centre for Byzantine, Ottoman and Modern Greek Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, p. 205 Sultan Bayezid II donated the area to Mirahor (General of Cavalry) Iljas Bey. The village was transformed in 1505 in an evaladiet-type waqf (religious trust). By the late 18th century, with the spread of çiflik-type feudalism instead of the military feudalism inside the Ottoman Empire, many villages of the area were transformed into çiflik. Ali Pasha Tepelena turned Boboshticë as such in 1817, while the adjacent village of Drenovë was turned in 1814. With the demise of Ali Pasha, the Ottoman Porte confiscated from his domains over 1000 çifliks, between others Boboshticë and Drenovë, and turned them into imlak (imperial çiflik). They remained such even after the Tanzimat reforms and other agrarian laws. The economical situation of the villagers degraded a lot during the 19th century, far worse than what it used to be in the old system of timar. They were obliged to pay the Ashar in addition to other ordinary and extraordinary taxes. By the end of the 19th century, immigration to Romania and Bulgaria became a widespread phenomenon. Other families had migrated even before, i.e. Gerasi family completely left when Ali Pasha took over. According to some sources, nearly half of the villagers emigrated to Wallachia during the rule of Ali Pasha. The village was internally ruled by an \\"council of elders\\" led by a person from one of the richest families, referred as Kodjabashis. In 1823, for unclassified reasons, Boboshticë suffered a high level of mortality. 23 people are recorded to have died from the nearby monastery of St. Nicholas (Alb: Shën Kollit), while 325 in total from the area. A considerable number of the local population, though not of Greek origin, participated in the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830) and supported the Greek side. Six locals fell during the Siege of Messolonghi. Two uncles of the well-known Romanian author Victor Eftimiu participated in future anti-Ottoman wars. In 1873 the residents of Boboshtica wrote a request to the Bulgarian Exarch Antim I, written in Greek letters in the local dialect. They expressed their Bulgarian affiliation and provided a general information about their village. Boboshchitsa had 150 houses and was divided into five neighborhoods: Popchìshche, Chelkoveàne, Bràtsko, Bùnar and Dòlno Bùnar. The rivers that crossed the village were named: Goleàma reàka (Big river), Màla reàka (Little river) and Pòvrok. The main problem the village faced was to buy the village lands back from the Ottoman state.Снегаров, Иван. Един важен български документ от Корчанско, Македонски преглед, 1934, № 1, p. 1-16. (Snegarov Ivan. An important Bulgarian document from the region of Korcha, Macedonian Review, 1934, Vol. 1, p. 1-16.) A Greek elementary school was already operating during the 1873-1874 school season. Greek education was expanded with the creation of a kindergarten in 1888. In 1878-1879, many diaspora members together with local villagers took the initiative of buying village lands back from the Ottoman Empire, 57 years after they had been turned into imlak, based on the new imperial laws which allowed the Christians to buy/sell land and similar properties. The diaspora managed to have to the support of Russian diplomat Ignatyev for this purpose. Ignatyev succeeded in convincing the Ottoman authorities to add Boboshticë (and Drenovë) to the list of Ottoman çifliks which were destined to auction. At this time the village is recorded to have had 1004 people. The community distributed financial obligations (debentures) written in Bulgarian, Romanian, and Greek in order to facilitate the fund-raising. During the Greco-Italian War in World War II, the strategic pass that led to the village changed hands several times in November 1940 but was finally taken by the Greek army after continuous pressure. The headquarters of the V Corps of the Greek army was stationed in the village. According to the Bulgarian Exarchate, Boboshticë had 250 houses with 1,471 Bulgarian inhabitants in the early 20th century.Трайчев, Георги. Български селища в днешна Албания, в: Отецъ Паисий, 15-31 юли 1929 година, стр.213. Also around this time, in 1903, German scholar Heinrich Gelzer visited the village and described the local population as a Bulgarian island in an Albanian sea, remained from the old Slavic population before Albanian mass migration from the 14th and 15th centuries.Gelzer, Heinrich. Vom heiligen Berge und aus Makedonien. Reisebilder aus den Athosklöstern und dem Insurrektionsgebiet, Leipzig 1904, pp. 211-212. The villagers of Boboshticë- Drenovë have been a substantial part of the Albanian community in Romania. Their names appear on the statutes of the main organizations of Albanian diaspora there, with a great contribute in the Albanian National Awakening. Such societies were \\"Diturija\\", \\"Drenova\\", \\"Boboshtani\\" etc. Thanas Kantili (1863-1933) from Boboshticë was vice-president of the \\"Diturija\\" society, and a delegate of the community to the Albanian Congress of Trieste in 1913. Kongresi i Triestes, ja procesverbali i bisedimeve 1-4 mars 1913 (in Albanian) Demographics According to German linguist Gustav Weigand, during the first decades of the 20th century, the villages \\"Boboschtitza\\" and \\"Drenowo\\" were a Bulgarian linguistic island in Albania. Weigand, Gustav. \\"Ethnographie von Makedonien. Geschichtlich-nationaler, sprachlich-statistischer Teil\\", Leipzig, Friedrich Brandstetter, 1924, p. 80. The historian Ivan Snegarov noted in 1934 a significant processes of Albanization among the local Bulgarians. The majority of the population of the village was Bulgarian until 1960. Then the mass migration of Vlachs began, while the old local population migrated to the cities in Albania.Бело, Миранда. Етикетният език в говора на село Бобощица (Република Албания), електронно списание \\"Онгъл\\", Год. VI, 2014, бр. 8, с. 45-53.(Belo, Miranda. \\"The language label in a manner of speaking in Boboshtitsa\\", electronic magazine \\"Ongal\\", 2014, vol. 8, pp. 45-53.) According to some scientists, Boboshticë and the neighboring Drenovë were the only villages in which the Korča dialect of the Macedonian language was still spoken, as of 1991.Македонските дијалекти во Егејска Македонија: (Обид за класификација). Македонските дијалекти во Егејска Македонија: научен собир, Скопје 23–24 декември 1991. Skopje: MANU, 1994, стр. 23–60. According to linguist Xhelal Ylli, following a visit to the village in 2005, only five or six speakers remained living in the village. The dialect is classified as part of Bulgarian dialects by other authors.Trubetzkoy, Nikolai. Principles_of_Phonology, Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1977, p. 277, 279 (note 9))Милетич, Любомир. Нови сведения за македонските българи в Бобощица (Корчанско) и техният език, Македонски преглед, X, 1937, 3 и 4, с. 19-32, (Miletic, Ljubomir. \\"New information about the Macedonian Bulgarians in Boboshtica (Korchansko) and their language\\", Macedonian Review, X, 1937, 3 and 4, pp. 19-32.) Some Bulgarian linguists emphasize that the reflexes of yat in this western Bulgarian dialect is wide, like it is in Eastern Bulgarian dialects.Георгиева, Елена и Невена Тодорова, Българските народни говори, София 1986, с. 79. (Georgieva, Elena and Nevena Todorova, Bulgarian dialects, Sofia 1986, p. 79.)Бояджиев, Тодор А. Помагало по българска диалектология, София 1984, с. 62. (Boyadzhiev Todor A. \\"Handbook on Bulgarian Dialectology\\", Sofia, 1984, р. 62.) Dhimitër Theodhor Çanço (Dimitar Tsantso) was a teacher from the village who wrote the historical \\"Memorandia\\", a collection of orally transmitted historical facts, as well as documentary facts. The \\"Memorandia\\" was written in Greek. The original copy belongs to the author's family. It was copied by two of Canco's nephews and the copy is part of the Albanian Archives. In his memoirs, written in Greek, Tcanko defined the local villagers as Orthodox Christians who speak a Bulgarian dialect.Mazon, André \\"Documents, contes et chansons slaves de l’Albanie du Sud\\", Paris, 1936, pp. 382-383 Andre Mazon, an expert in Slavic studies, has published an exceptional source of information it in his Documents slaves de l'Albanie de Sud, II, pieces complemetaires (Paris, Institut d'Etudes Slaves, 1965), for which Bulgarian scholar Maria Filipova made the translation from Greek to French. Mazon also published seventeen correspondence letters written by Mihal Kuneshka, a villager, dating back to the late 19th century. All are in the Macedonian language, proving the existence of the Slavic element. Mazon included as well sixteen letters written in French by Victor Efitimiu, which describe old legends and oral traditions leading to the village's assumed origin, as well as much third-party information from other authors. In 2005, a Greek-language school was again operating in the village.webalbania.com Shkollës 9 vjeçare të fshatit Boboshticë At the same time, controversies rose regarding testimonies that the Greek government was paying people to declare themselves as Greek and register as North Epirotes, in attempts to Hellenize the area. A memorial was built to commemorate Greek soldiers fallen during the Greco-Italian War. Disagreements between some villagers and representatives of the Omonia organisation rose because of allegations that the construction personnel violated the village cemetery while building the memorial. This led to a one-year long imprisonment sentence for Omonia's leader in Korça, Naum Disho, however his sentence was removed by the Korçe's Court of Appeal. Today, the majority of the villagers identify as Vlachs and many have received Greek citizenship from the Greek government, together with pensions for elderly people. The village is also referred as one of the Vlach villages in Albania. Top-Channel television visited the area and interviewed many people from the area including neighboring villages, and published the findings in the documentary \\"Searching the Vlachs\\" (). The Albanian school, first opened in 1916 with 36 pupils, is suffering because the number of pupils registered each year is decreasing. During the late 2000s linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli carried out fieldwork, seeking to corroborate information about villages cited in past literature as being Slavic-speaking. Boboshticë was noted as having a population of Aromanians (Vlachs) with only a few remnants left of its former Slavic-speaking population. During the early 1960s Aromanians settled in Boboshticë, which resulted in an ethnic and linguistic change of demographics of the population in the village. \\"Vërnik [missing words!] eine völlig homogene südslavische Bevölkerung fast ohne albanische Mitbewohner gibt. Diese hat dort zudem den Status einer vom albanischen Staat offiziell anerkannten Minderheit, während Boboshtica inzwischen bis auf geringe Reste überwiegend und Drenova ganz von Albanern und Aromunen bewohnt wird. Die Beschreibung der oben erwähnten Orte und der dort gesprochenen Mundarten ist primärer Gegenstand der vorliegenden Monographie. Zu den übrigen in der Literatur häufig angeführten Ortschaften mit einer angeblich slavischen Bevölkerung wird an dieser Stelle nur eine kurze kritische Sichtung anhand der ebenfalls von uns gesammelten Informationen vorgenommen. In Drenova bei Korça, das neben Boboshtica vor allem durch die Arbeiten von MAZON (1936) und COURTHIADE (1993) bekannt wurde, gab es bis vor ein paar Jahren nur noch eine alte Frau, welche die ursprüngliche slavische Mundart beherrschte. Nach ihrem Tode spricht diese dort niemand mehr, wie Thomaidha Stefo angab, die 1942 in das Dorf einheiratete. Damals sprach man dort noch ausschließlich Bulgarisch (bullgarçe), und sie versuchte es deshalb ebenfalls zu lernen, hat es aber inzwischen wieder verlernt. Am Anfang der 60er Jahre kam eine größere Gruppe von aromunischen Siedlern nach Drenova und Boboshtica, und mit ihnen änderte sich die ethnische und sprachliche Struktur beider Orte grundlegend.\\" In the 2010s, only one elderly women remains in Boboshticë who is a speaker of the village's local Macedonian dialect called Kajnas (of us). \\"The isolated Macedonian dialect of Boboshtica in the Korcha region of Albania, which speakers themselves called Kajnas 'like us' is now a linguists tourist attraction performed for visiting foreign linguists by a single old women.\\" Religious monuments The village is home to the Church of Saint Demetrius and of Saint John the Forerunner. Both churches have been declared Cultural Monuments of Albania. The mural icons of Saint John's church have considerable resemblance with the ones from the Arbanasi village in Bulgaria, and many ones from a series of villages from North Macedonia, Greece and Bulgaria (Mesemvria, Kastoria, Veria, etc.). Until the 1960s two Orthodox monasteries were active next to Boboshticë; the Monastery of Saint Nicholas (Alb: Shën Kollit) on the east, and Monastery of the Dormition of the Theotokos (Alb: Shën Mërisë) on the south. The monasteries had dedicated guest rooms for hosting pilgrims from other areas of the Balkans during religious feasts and events. The St. Mary monastery had a Prilepska room for guest coming from Prilep area (Alb:Përlep), and an Ohridska for guests coming from Ohrid area (Alb: Ohri). Saint Nicholas was a stauropegic monastery, it was destroyed during the atheistic policies by the authorities of the Peoples Republic of Albania, but now has been restored.Ralitsa Rousseva, The Murals of the St. Demetrios Church in Boboštica: Local Traditions and Constantinople Influences in the Ecclesiastical Art of the Prespa-Korča Region in the Fourteenth Century, p. 4 People from Boboshticë *Gjergj Bubani (1899-1954), writer and publicist *Victor Eftimiu, Romanian poet and playwright *Thanas Kantili, Rilindas, vice- president of \\"Diturija\\" society in Bucharest *Sotir Kuneshka, physicist and academic *Archbishop Liolin (born in NY, family originating from Boboshticë) *Vani Trako (1923-2009), actorVani Trako passes away at the age of 86 (in Albanian) *Dimitar Tsantso/Dhimitër Theodhor Çanço (1814-1904), scholarMazon, André. \\"Documents, contes et chansons slaves de l'Albanie du Sud\\", Paris, 1936, р. 382-383.

Bishop of Casale and Senator  He was born on 27 July 1808 in Savigliano to Filippo, count of Calabiana, and the noblewoman Sofia Toesca of the counts of Castezzo. On 18 March 1847 he was appointed Bishop of Casale Monferrato by Charles Albert of Sardinia and consecrated bishop on 6 June 1847 in Rome by Cardinal Ugo Pietro Spinola. As bishop of Casale he was involved in the successful campaign to save its ancient Romanesque cathedral from demolition. On 3 May 1848 he was nominated as senator by king Charles Albert, taking the oath on 22 May of that year. He unsuccessfully opposed Siccardi reforms of 1850, which were intended to revoke certain ancient privileges which the Catholic Church enjoyed in Piedmont, and he led the opposition to further reforms in 1855, intended to institute a ‘free church in a free state’, provoking the Calabiana crisis which forced the resignation of Cavour, although again the legislation was passed into law. Archbishop of Milan In 1867 he was named by Pope Pius IX archbishop of Milan, and his appointment solved the crisis in such important and large diocese. Actually the previous archbishop Paolo Angelo Ballerini of Milan had been suggested by the Austrian emperor, but he was not allowed to enter in the town by the Kingdom of Sardinia that took possession of the Lombardy after the Second Italian War of Independence. So with the appointment of Nazari di Calabiana Milan again had a residence bishop. In the frame of the hostility between the Holy See and the kingdom of Sardinia (later Kingdom of Italy), Nazari di Calabiana was considered to be on conciliatory positions, while the previous archbishop Ballerini, who during Nazari's reign resided in Seregno near Milan, remained a fierce opponent of the Reign. Nazari di Calabian was never created cardinal. As Archbishop of Milan, Nazari di Calabiana is remembered for his social activity, for the erection of new churches in the suburbs of the town and for the discovery of the relics of Saint Ambrose and Gervasius and Protasius founded in an old sarcophagus buried under the altar of Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. At the First Vatican Council he was the leader of the minority of Italian bishops who opposed the introduction of the doctrine of Papal Infallibility, but after the proclamation of the dogma he promptly undersigned it. Luigi Nazari di Calabiana died in Milan on 23 October 1893.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is only found in the North Island and the adult moths have two different colour variations. Taxonomy This species was first described by Baron Cajetan von Felder, Rudolf Felder and Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer in 1875 under the name Stathmopoda miniella. Edward Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, named it Gracilaria ethela in 1880. Meyrick synonymised this name with S. miniella in 1889. John S. Dugdale assigned this species to the genus Macraostola in 1988. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows: The adult moths of this species come in two colour variations. The more common variation is the crimson and yellow form. The other variation has more dull fuscous colouration replacing the crimson.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. M. miniella is common and found throughout the North Island.  Behaviour and life history  The larvae of M. miniella are leaf miners that later in their development also roll the leaves of their host plant, both to feed from and then to pupate in. Habitat and host plant This species is found in native forest habitat. The larvae are leaf miners on Syzygium maire, a tree species also endemic to New Zealand.

It is located at the junction of Pilrig Street and Broughton Road in the Pilrig area, close to the historical boundary of Leith. The cemetery is protected as a category C listed building. History The cemetery was developed by the Edinburgh and Leith Cemetery Company, with David Cousin as architect, and opened on 20 September 1846. It covers an area of . Originally known as the Edinburgh and Leith Cemetery,http://maps.nls.uk/view/102190564 the cemetery proved popular and was extended eastwards around 1880. The main entrance was originally from the north-west (Broughton Road) but this has been sealed. The sole entrance is now from the north-east (Pilrig Street). The latter originally had an entrance lodge above the gate, but this was demolished around 1975. The cemetery was in independent private ownership until around 1980 when the City of Edinburgh Council then took over the grounds. Memorials A large memorial at the furthest point from the current Pilrig Street entrance, lying against Broughton Road wall near North Pilrig Heights, marks a mass grave and commemorates the Gretna rail disaster of 22 May 1915, in which 215 soldiers of the 1st/7th Battalion The Royal Scots were killed. The men, mostly from Leith, were on their way to board ship at Liverpool in order to travel to the battlefront at Gallipoli. The handful of survivors were sent onwards the following day. The bodies of those killed in the railway disaster were returned to Leith and buried with great aplomb on 24 May with the 15th and 16th battalions Royal Scots serving as guard of honour. These are among 270 First World War casualties and 36 Second World War casualties interred at Rosebank. The cemetery also houses the main war memorial to the two world wars, serving the Pilrig area, marked by a white cross designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Over and above this memorial and the Gretna Memorial there are several war graves scattered through the cemetery for individuals who died of wounds or disease on return from the war. A number of 19th-century merchants and ship-owners, shipbuilders and ship-masters from Leith are buried at Rosebank. There are also several 20th-century Sikh and Islamic burials. The apparently high number of \\"pilots\\" refers to harbour pilots (the original meaning) rather than aircraft pilots. Unusual surnames found include Arcus, Carnie, Combe, Cormack, Eunson, Flucker, Goalen, Junner, Kellock, Ketchen, Spaven, Tilloch and Waldie. Those who are homeless and die on the street along with several stillborn children (Scots law requires burial not cremation) are buried at the cemetery. The latter are marked by a modern monument giving a place to remember them, in interlocking granite pieces representing mother and child. The inscription reads \\"to all those children never known but always loved\\". An abnormally high number of stones are noted as \\"drowned\\" or \\"lost at sea\\" (see Notable Interments).

It is a relatively small area of sand dunes comprising sand of seven distinct colours (approximately red, brown, violet, green, blue, purple and yellow). The main feature of the place is that since these differently coloured sands spontaneously settle in different layers, dunes acquire a surrealistic, striped colouring. Since the earth was first exposed, rains have carved beautiful patterns into the hillside, creating an effect of earthen meringue.  Description  The sands formed from the decomposition of volcanic rock (basalt) gullies into clay, further transformed into ferralitic soil by total hydrolysis; the two main elements of the resulting soil, iron and aluminium, are responsible for red/anthracite and blue/purplish colours respectively. The different shades of colour are believed to be a consequence of the molten volcanic rock cooling down at different external temperatures (hence rates), but the causes of their consistent spontaneous separation are yet to be fully clarified.  Name  The name \\"Seven Coloured Earth(s)\\" is a descriptive—rather than an official—name. Sources report many variations of this name, including \\"Chamarel Seven Coloured Earths\\", \\"Chamarel Coloured Earth(s)\\", \\"Coloured Earth\\", and ' in French.

Labour Party candidate Debbie Abrahams held the seat for her party with an increased majority over the Liberal Democrats, succeeding Phil Woolas, whose victory in the 2010 general election had been declared void because he had knowingly made false statements attacking his Liberal Democrat opponent's personal character. Background Election leaflet by Phil Woolas used during the general election and ruled to contain deliberate false statements attacking Elwyn Watkins' character. The election was triggered on 5 November 2010 after sitting MP Phil Woolas was reported personally guilty of \\"knowingly making false statements\\" about the personal character of his Liberal Democrat opponent, Elwyn Watkins, during the 2010 general election campaign by an election court consisting of two High Court judges. In consequence, Woolas ceased to be an MP on 5 November and was banned from holding public office for three years. Woolas applied for a judicial review of the decision: his initial application was rejected, but he entered a second request for a review. Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow stated that a date for the by-election would not be set until all legal proceedings were complete. Woolas's second request for review was heard at the High Court on 16 November 2010; the Court of Appeal announced on 3 December 2010 that, although one of the three statements on which the election court had found Woolas guilty was not within the Act, the other two were and so the judgment was upheld, after which Woolas declared \\"That's it – I'm out\\", conceding defeat and leaving the way open for the by-election. By parliamentary convention, the party who last held the seat moves the writ for the by-election, and it was rumoured that Labour planned to call the election for 3 February 2011. However, a writ for the election was instead moved for 13 January by the Liberal Democrats. The contest was the first by-election of the 2010 parliament, and the first by-election to be caused by an election court overturning the previous result since the 1997 Winchester by-election. It is also notable for being the earliest by-election in the calendar year for 55 years and the fifth-earliest since the First World War. Candidates The Labour Party had more than eighty members apply to be their candidate in the election. Initial frontrunner Afzal Khan was not shortlisted, and the party instead selected Debbie Abrahams from a shortlist of three. Abrahams had unsuccessfully fought to retain the Colne Valley seat at the 2010 general election after the retirement of Kali Mountford, where Labour fell from first to third place, and is married to the former Lancashire cricket captain John Abrahams. The Liberal Democrats again selected Elwyn Watkins to fight the by- election; Watkins is a former Rochdale borough councillor who had previously worked as a business advisor to a Saudi Arabian sheikh. The Conservative Party also reselected their general election candidate, Kashif Ali, a barrister from Higginshaw. Two other parties who stood in the general election confirmed new candidates for the by-election. The British National Party at first announced that their candidate would be party leader Nick Griffin, who had stood in neighbouring Oldham West and Royton in 2001. However Griffin was replaced by former Manchester pub landlord Derek Adams, who had contested Blackley and Broughton at the 2010 general election. The UK Independence Party nominated their new deputy leader, Paul Nuttall, who was, at the time, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for North West England. Three further smaller parties which had not fought the general election put up candidates. The Green Party chose Peter Allen, from nearby Glossop; he works in an advice centre in Manchester. Stephen Morris, an official of Manchester Metrolink and trade union branch official, was announced as the candidate for the English Democrats; he is also Chairman of the party. Musician, composer and teacher Loz Kaye, who had recently become leader of the Pirate Party, was also nominated. Two further fringe candidates had less serious agendas. Nick Delves, who had acquired the nickname \\"the flying brick\\" after a paragliding accident, became the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate, while artist and poet David Bishop (founder of the Church of the Militant Elvis Party) offered himself to the electors as a 'Bus Pass Elvis' candidate. Campaign A selection of campaign materials delivered to constituents for the by-election As the first by-election since the establishment of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, there was interest in whether the two parties would form a pact. Prime Minister David Cameron publicly wished Watkins well at the start of the campaign, but both parties officially rejected the idea that there was a pact, with Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats claiming that the Tories had no chance of winning the seat, and Cameron later reminding voters that it had been a three-horse race in 2010. Both former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and Labour Party leader Ed Miliband claimed that it was the first opportunity for voters to make their views known on the coalition, although David Cameron argued that it was instead about the actions of Woolas. Woolas himself claimed that his disqualification would help the Labour Party, as voters would object to courts overturning the election result. The Labour Party complained that the date of the by-election would make it difficult for students to vote, as they would not yet have returned to their studies in the constituency. However, the Liberal Democrats claimed that this would be outweighed by the number of students at their parents' houses during their holidays from universities elsewhere. Leaders of all three major parties campaigned in the seat in the run-up to the election, David Cameron noted that he was the first prime minister to campaign in an English by-election since 1997, when Tony Blair campaigned in the Uxbridge by-election – Gordon Brown had campaigned in 2008 for the Glenrothes by-election in Scotland. On 6 January, a week prior to the by-election, The Times endorsed the Liberal Democrats and their candidate Elwyn Watkins. On the last weekend of the campaign, Liberal Democrat MP and government minister Andrew Stunell issued a party press release hailing a government scheme to reuse empty homes. The scheme was only officially unveiled on the following Monday, and shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Jon Trickett wrote to the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell questioning whether Stunell's actions had broken the rules on election period 'purdah'. O'Donnell wrote back on 12 January explaining that Stunell \\"recognises with hindsight\\" that his party press release could have been linked by the public with a government spending announcement, and that Stunell had apologised for the mistake. Two opinion polling companies released constituency polls for the by-election on 8 January. ICM and Populus used sample sizes of 340 and 772, respectively (excluding those who refused to respond or did not specify a party). ICM's figures of Labour 44%, Liberal Democrats 27% and Conservatives 18% represented a sharp percentage decrease of 8% for the Conservatives, contrasted with a sizable 12% increase for Labour and a modest 5% decline in Liberal Democrat support since the 2010 general election, indicating a secure Labour victory in the constituency. Populus' figures uncovered similar trends, recording voting intention as Labour 46%, Liberal Democrats 29% and Conservatives 15%, representing percentage changes since May 2010 of −11% for the Conservatives, +14% for Labour and −3% for the Liberal Democrats. A telephone poll by Survation reported voting intention figures of Labour 31%, Liberal Democrats 30%, Conservatives 6% and undecided 23% (note the ICM and Populus poll figures exclude undecideds), on a sample size of 293 (excluding those who refused to respond). Result Having only narrowly retained the seat at the general election eight months earlier, Labour retained it once again but this time with a vastly increased majority, with the Liberal Democrats finishing second.

Tourists are attracted by the World War I battlefields as well as Bellewaerde, the oldest operating theme park in Belgium. History =World War I= Map showing the location of Hooge directly east of Ypres, as well as the frontline of the Ypres Salient as it was in June 1916. In World War I, the village belonged to one of the easternmost sectors of the Ypres Salient, which made it the site of intense and sustained fighting between German and Allied forces. From 1914 the front line of the Salient ran through the Hooge area and there was almost constant fighting in the area over the next three years, during which the village and the Château de Hooge (see below) were totally destroyed.Hooge on ww1battlefields.co.uk, accessed 25 April 2015 Even during times of relative quiet on this part of the Western Front, the average casualty rate for the British and Commonwealth forces was around 300 per day. During the First Battle of Ypres (19 October – 22 November 1914), when the Allies captured the town of Ypres from the Germans, the Château de Hooge was used by the 1st and 2nd Divisions for their joint headquarters.Duffy, Michael firstworldwar.com 25 August 2002, accessed 16 February 2007 By the end of the battle in November 1914 the Germans had been driven back, but the front line of the Salient now ran around Hooge.http://www.webmatters.net/belgium/ww1_hooge.htm access date 24 April 2015 During the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), Hooge was again the site of intense fighting, including the Battle of Bellewaarde which was fought in the area from 24 to 25 May 1915. By the end of July, the Germans again took control of the area.Battlefields 14-18, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 On 30 July 1915, Hooge was the site of the first use of flamethrowers (\\"liquid fire\\" as it was referred to at the time), employed by the Germans against British positions.With the British Army in Flanders: Hooge Crater, access date 26 April 2015. Hooge was retaken by the British on 9 August 1915, reclaimed by the Germans on 16 June 1916 (for strategic developments in this area during June 1916, see Battle of Mont Sorrel) and retaken by the British on 31 July 1917. The Germans retook Hooge in April 1918 as part of the Spring Offensive but were driven back from the area by the British on 28 September 1918. Landmarks =Château and Bellewaerde= Entrance to Bellewaerde amusement park Before the war, the village of Hooge was the site of the Château de Hooge, a manor house which served as country house of the local landed gentry and residence of the lord of the manor. By July 1915 artillery had reduced the château to rubble and it was never rebuilt. After the war, much of the site was redeveloped as a theme parkfirstworldwar.com and is now occupied by the Bellewaerde, the oldest operating theme park in Belgium. Established in 1954 as a zoo and safari, the park expanded in the early 1980s and is now the most frequently visited amusement park in Flanders. On the site of the château's original stables, there is now a hotel and restaurant. =World War I battlefield= Hooge Crater Cemetery with Cross of Sacrifice and the stone-faced circle designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in memory of the many craters nearby During World War I, the entire village was completely destroyed. Both sides exploded mines beneath the front line trenches there, the evidence of which are still visible today. Although the largest mine crater (created by a mine detonated at Hooge by the 175th Tunnelling Company of the Royal Engineers on 19 July 1915) has since been filled in, several other large mine craters that were created over the course of the fightingWWI Battlefields, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 can still be seen. The most visible evidence remaining today is a large pond near the hotel and restaurant at the Bellewaerde theme park. The site is the result of Baron de Wynck, who landscaped three mine craters (blown by German units in June 1916 as part of their offensive against Canadian troops) into the existing pond near the hotel (image).

Paris was finally relieved from the siege by an international Catholic and Spanish army under the command of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. Background After his victory over the Catholic forces commanded by Charles, Duke of Mayenne and Charles of Guise, Duke of Aumale at the Battle of Ivry on 14 March, Henry of Navarre advanced with his troops on his main objective of Paris, possession of which would allow him to confirm his contested claim to the French throne. Paris at the time was a large walled city of around 200,000–220,000 people.Horne. Seven Ages of Paris: Portrait of a City p.77–79 Siege of Paris On 7 May, Henry's army surrounded the city, imposing a blockade and burnt windmills to prevent food from reaching Paris. Henry had at this point only around 12,000–13,000 troops, facing defenders estimated at around 30,000, mostly militia. Owing to the limited amount of heavy siege artillery that Henry had brought, it was thought that the Catholic city could only be compelled to surrender through starvation. The city's defence was placed in the hands of the young Charles Emmanuel, Duke of Nemours.Horne. Seven Ages of Paris: Portrait of a City p.80–81 Henry set up his artillery on the hills of Montmartre, and bombarded the city from there. In July his force was swelled by reinforcements to 25,000 and by August he had overrun all the suburbs outside the city walls. Henry tried to negotiate the surrender of Paris, but his terms were rejected and the siege continued. On 30 August, news reached the city that a Spanish-Catholic relief army under general the Duke of Parma was on its way. The Duke of Parma's army was able to break the siege and send food supplies into the city. After a final attack on the city's ramparts failed, Henry broke off his siege and retreated. An estimated 40,000–50,000 of the population died during the siege, most of starvation. Aftermath After repeated failures to take the capital city of Paris, Henry IV converted to Catholicism, reportedly declaring that \\"Paris is well worth a Mass\\". The war- weary Parisians turned on the Catholic League's hardliners when they continued the conflict even after Henry had converted. Paris jubilantly welcomed the formerly Protestant Henry of Navarre in 1593, and he was crowned King of France the following year. He later issued the Edict of Nantes in an attempt to end the religious strife that had torn the country apart.Knecht.

He was also elected Sheriff of Charles Mix County, South Dakota.  Biography  Jack Sully was born Arthur McDonald in Virginia circa 1850. Sully graduated from an American or Canadian college and was living in Hamilton, Ontario, by the early 1870s. During that decade, he moved to the southern area of the Dakota Territory (to what is now South Dakota) and gained employment as a cowboy. There, he became a skillful horse rider as well as a good shooter. In 1872, Sully was elected Charles Mix County, South Dakota, sheriff in a landslide, winning the vote 61-1. However, election observers noted that this tally placed the number of ballots cast greater than the number of people who actually voted. The cowboy soon became acquainted with criminals, and by 1880 had become an outlaw and married a Sioux woman named Mary. Sully and his wife moved to the Rosebud Indian Reservation, and Sully became the leader of an outlaw gang which caused the loss of hundreds of cattle and horses from Dakota Territory properties each year. In his early days, Sully also caused the Government of the United States trouble when he cut timber from government-owned property to sell at the market. By the early 1890s, the cattle rustlers had reached into Canada, with stolen Saskatchewan and Alberta cattle being found in American markets, and vice versa. Law enforcement remained unaware of the perpetrators of the crimes. By 1900, the rustling gang had accumulated over 12 members, stolen 50,000 cattle and 3,000 horses, as well as killed seven settlers on the Missouri River. In 1901, law enforcement forced Sully to retreat to Canada, but he returned two years later, in 1903. On an unknown date, Sully was arrested and held at Mitchell on a cattle rustling charge, but escaped from prison and eluded officers until May 1904. During that month, the new United States Deputy Marshal, Johnny Petrie, who had been a close friend of Sully's until he discovered his illegal activities, shot the outlaw when he refused to surrender in a stand at Rosebud Indian Reservation. By 1906, law enforcement officers had forced Sully's old gang to disband.

It deals with Doctor Doom's covert overthrow of the royal family of Wakanda and the following clash with various members of the superhuman community. Plot summary =Doomwar preludes= The events leading up to Doomwar are described in Black Panther vol. 5 #12. =Doomwar= Part 1 It has just been two days since the Desturi took over the government of Wakanda. Already, they are trying Storm for assaulting unarmed farmers, practicing witchcraft and crimes against humanity. The possible sentence is life in prison or death. As she stood before the Desturi leader T'Kan, who accuses her of corrupting Wakanda, Storm defiantly refuses him and swears that her husband T'Challa will come for her and retake Wakanda. After she is taken away, T'Kan declares that they shall isolate Wakanda once more and deport all foreigners. However, the chief of the Marsh tribe asks him if he had outside help. T'Kan denies it. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom is attempting to crack the vault locks containing the vibranium he needs. However, the combinations on the next lock are alchemical symbols, which contradicts T'Challa preference for science. Doom is able to crack it with his magic and a blood sacrifice. His aide Akeja then ask what if T'Challa and Shuri are planning to retake the throne. However, Doom isn't concerned, for when he is done, Wakanda will be no more. Meanwhile, in Utopia, the X-Men are at the table, learning about the Wakandan coup and announcement of isolation. Just then, Cipher and Psylocke informs them that T'Challa, Shuri and the entire Dora Milaje brigade are at their door. Cyclops assumes that they have come to ask for asylum, though Shuri states that it is not the case. T'Challa explains that the Desturi are a dissident group who is well-connected in the Wakandan government. They worked together with Doom to take him out. He later found out that every person in the palace was infected with nanites through food and water, making them living camera for Doom. He tried to crack them but the nanites simply self- destructed. Only he and Shuri escaped infection because being the Black Panther allows a heightened sense of awareness; T'Challa himself did not consume any food or water from the palace and confided his concerns with Shuri. Right now, T'Challa has realized that Doom has only helped the Desturi to gain access to Wakanda's vibranium. The reason why is because vibranium has a secret that no one else knows about: it can amplify mystical energies and its effects are infinite. With his mystical know-how, Doom can use the vibranium to make himself unstoppable. Meanwhile, Storm is placed in a cell specifically designed to nullify her powers. T'Kan also adds that T'Challa designed it himself. However, Storm is able to unlock the door with her technical skills, only to find Doom waiting for her. He demands her assistance in decrypting the final lock, requiring a \\"thief's touch\\". He then threatens to kill T'Challa's family if she doesn't comply. Unfortunately, she doesn't complete by the time and Doom motions for his goons to shoot Ramonda, only for S'yan to take the bullet for her. Doom then demands that if she doesn't cooperate, he'll kill everyone in the room and ten thousands subjects a minute. Grudgingly, Storm decodes the second-last lock. Somewhere on Easter Island, The Broker and his assistant Mrs. Tickle prepare an army of Doombots to conquer the world. Back in Utopia, Shuri asks for the X-Men's assistance in retaking Wakanda. Unfortunately, Cyclops states that their global status is fragile at best and that last thing they need to look like aggressors to the rest of the world, who may unite against them. Therefore, he cannot sanction any X-Man's involvement, to which T'Challa understands. Thirty minutes later, as the X-Men supply the Dora Milaje, Cyclops asks T'Challa about what to do with the nanites in Storm if she is rescued. The former Black Panther answers that he has a \\"friend' whose working on that. He then commends how Cyclops is making decisions like a true leader, who would have to make difficult decisions. Cyclops then states that he can't sanction the X-Men's involvement, but that doesn't mean that he can't dissuade them from going of their own free will. Already, Wolverine, Colossus and Nightcrawler have packed up. As their planes leave, T'Challa elaborates on Wakanda's defenses, which is virtually impenetrable. However, since he had personally designed the defense grid, there are a few surprises that the Desturi won't expect. Unfortunately, there is no way that can retake the country without killing anyone. However, Shuri considers that those who allied themselves with the Desturi have betrayed their heritage and she is willing to do whatever it takes to retake their home. Meanwhile, T'Kan is informed, by his generals, that workers are claiming to have fallen under an illness. However, he refuses to believe that a simple illness is affecting them and demands that they interview these people. Just then, he is alerted to the arrival of T'Challa, Shuri and the Dora Milaje. T'Kan appears before them holographically, asking if they intend to spill the blood of their people. Shuri answers that they are waging a war against the Desturi. She demands that they stand down from control and avoid bloodshed, if they want clemency and involvement with the political process. T'Kan rebuffs her, asking if they would kill innocents in the streets. T'Challa then declares, \\"You are not Wakanda--\\" Halfway into his sentence, Nightcrawler teleports both T'Challa and Shuri into the throneroom, where the latter snaps T'Kan's neck. T'Challa finishes his sentence by saying, \\"We are.\\" Part 2 Nightcrawler is shocked that T'Challa and Shuri executed the entire Desturi Council, to which the Wakandan royals state that this is how, in war, they deals with traitors. Now that the serpent's head is decapitated, they have to purge the rest of the Desturi. Shuri promises to handle that, while T'Challa goes to stop Doom from stealing the vibranium. Unfortunately, Nightcrawler can't teleport him to Doom's location because of some Doomtech that prevents him from doing so. At the moment, Doom, who is monitoring T'Challa, comments that he is about to come to rescue his wife. He then demands that Storm open the final lock, or he'll kill Ramonda and then fill Wakanda's streets in an ocean of blood. Outside Wakanda's borders, the Wakandan army is waiting for orders, doing a standoff with Wolverine, Colossus and the Dora Milaje. Nightcrawler then arrives back to teleport his fellow X-Men. Meanwhile, Aneka, the leader of the Dora Milaje, is in communication with T'Challa, explaining the possibility that the Army will eventually attack. He advises that they strike first to buy time for them to complete their mission. Aneka then gives a rallying speech to her sword-sisters to fight for Wakanda. The Army then notices the Dora Milaje rallying and decide to attack. Back inside the palace, the heroes fight their way through Desturi loyalists who have refused to stand down. The X-Men are appalled that Shuri killed a man who threw down his arms, to which she retorts that he was in her way. Wolverine warns of the danger of losing herself, but she responds that she finally found herself. As soon as they take out the communication jammers, Doombots and Desturi soldiers show up. As they fight their way through, Nightcrawler tries reasoning with Shuri that these are her people. She shoots back that she can't show mercy to those who had betrayed their heritage. Nightcrawler retorts that as their leader, she must prove a good example, not a show of bloodshed. Shuri defends by saying that she is doing her duty as both princess regent and the Black Panther. At the vibranium vault, Storm warns Doom that her husband will kill him for what he has done. Doom retorts that T'Challa has failed, for their little game of chess had him outmatched, resulting in his victory over Wakanda. He then determines that the last lock is a puzzle. He then finds a message reading, \\"Only through purity unencumbered by pretense may you pass.\\" Doom then contemplates the meaning of the riddle. Then, T'Challa arrives, prompting Doom to grab Storm by the head. He gives T'Challa five seconds to choose between his wife or the vibranium. As soon as the countdown is up, Doom comments says that he has attained victory and throws Storm at her husband, before leaving. T'Challa opens the vault to find it empty, with one word written on the wall: CHECKMATE. Part 3 Doom passed the final lock of the Wakandan security system “purity”. He enters the plane of Bast the panther God. He strips off his armor and offers himself up for judgment. Doom doesn’t try any tricks he does not fight instead he does as the test required he reveals his ultimate truth the very dogma by which he has lived, the real reason for his perceived Villainy. He has seen the future as a sorcerer and thus has seen the world lead to ruin in countless futures, Days of Future Past, Skrull conquered world, Shi'ar conquered world, Bishop’s future, Galactic Avengers etc. What he has found is a single glimmering hope to save the human race a world in which he rules with an iron fist. Only here does he see the world surviving and thus his actions are “pure” simply by virtue that he believes it completely. In the end Bast is truly shocked at the purity in Doom’s acts of Villainy. Bast despite being protective of her people has no choice but to cede the Vibranium to Doom for he has passed the test she herself has set. Part 4 The Fantastic Four, Storm and the Wakandans are battling Doombots in the Easter Island. Unfortunately, the vibranium composing the Doombots has been magically enhanced, making them physically tougher. Therefore, Shuri brings in vibranium-based weaponry to even the odds. However, Doom evacuated his factory and destroyed it, along with the rest of his Doombots. Upon analyzing the remains back in Wakanda, it is determined that Doom had programmed the Doombots to have adaptive intelligence, to give the others a strategic advantage. With various other fabrication facilities Doom stationed across the world, Shuri opted to take strike teams and deal with them. But despite her initiative, they sustain heavy casualties in combating the other Doombots, which slowly learn from their battles. T'Challa opposes how her callousness in throwing away the lives of her followers, but Shuri counters that Doom sees him as predictable. T'Challa could only admit to Mr. Fantastic that she is right. He made the mistake of augmenting himself with magic to go hand-to-hand with Doom, for the fight isn't going to be won through muscle or technology. Therefore, he has to undergo unorthodox methods, bringing up a hologram of an unspecified containment system. Meanwhile, the Fantastic Four and the Wakandans hit multiple facilities across globe. However, Doom isn't concerned, for he knows that he has already won. He is proven right when his foes begin to tire out and weaken, further justifying T'Challa's point that they need to be unorthodox and hit Doom where it hurts. Mr. Fantastic asks what does he mean. On Latveria's southern border, a gypsy named Ygor approaches the checkpoint. The two sentries go out to check his passports. One finds in his wagon a cache full of weapons, before Ygor kills them both. \\"Ygor\\" is in fact revealed to be Deadpool, who storms Castle Doom, yelling, \\"Dooooooo-mie! I'm ho-o-o-o-o-ome!\\" Part 5 Shuri's attempts to take down Doom's production factories has only increased the number of casualties and they only recovered eight percent of the vibranium he stole. T'Challa sees that since Doom knows about Wakandan technology and is calculative, there's no way they can win this. Shuri insists that they have to take out Doom himself. But first, they need to find him first, along with the majority of the vibranium. And T'Challa has a plan, the most impossible and dangerous one. Meanwhile, in Doom's private lab, the Broker approaches him, reminding that besides running his global network, he also shouldn't underestimate his foes. Doom brushes his concerns off, as he had never underestimated Mr. Fantastic or T'Challa due to decades of experience. The Broker also adds about the costly collateral damage to his facilities but Doom cares not, for when he's done, he won't need it. T'Challa has hired a chaotic element into this game: Deadpool, who has been to Latveria, determining that Doom isn't there, and rounding up a net full of Doombot heads. T'Challa and Mr. Fantastic introduce Deadpool to the Nowhere Room, a device combining science and alchemy as shadow physics. With this device, they might be able to locate the vibranium on a quantum level. However, Mr. Fantastic is concerned about the fact that going through the process of omniexistence field would tear someone apart, even go mad. T'Challa has considered this, and therefore, he has summoned a special group of the Dora Milaje—the Midnight Angels—as Deadpool's backup; Deadpool can only say, \\"Do you believe in love at first, second, third and fourth sight?\\" Meanwhile, Shuri's team has managed to locate one of Doom's computers, listing all of his funding require to maintain his operations. If they can take away his funding, he can't even wage a war; even the Broker wouldn't work for free. They then donate over a hundred billion Euros to charities; the Broker fears that Doom will kill him for letting Shuri turn him into a humanitarian. Elsewhere, Storm and the Fantastic Four are having difficulties against Doombots and villains guarding the vibranium. Shuri is assisted by War Machine, who has been called in by Mr. Fantastic. He gives her a cyclical repulsor cell, to help hide and randomize her suit's energy signature, so the Doombots can't adapt. Deadpool is strapped with harness to help him maintain physical integrity inside the Nowhere Room. Once he finds the vibranium, he will send a signal to the Midnight Angels. Once inside, Deadpool is subjected to a variety of different aspects of himself, like being portrayed as Galactus. he soon emerges in Latveria. But as soon as he steps out, his left arm falls off. It took twenty minutes for it to reattach it, while sending out his distress signal. Unfortunately, sensor shielding prevent them from proving that Doom is holding the vibranium in his castle. Without proof for the World Court, the worse scenario is war. However, T'Challa doesn't care about politics and is determined to take Doom out. At that moment, Deadpool is grabbed by the head by Doom, whose new vibranium-type armor is brimming with energy. Part 6 T'Challa is in communication with War Machine and Shuri, informing them of his infiltration of Latveria. His sister considers it insane to just start a war; their homeland does not do such things. As she signs off, Mr. Fantastic adds to T'Challa that technically he is starting a war. Meanwhile, the Broker informs Doom regarding the depletion of all his funds. However, Doom is not concerned. He reveals to the Broker that with his new armor, he can feel every particle of vibranium scattered across the world when the meteor carrying it crashed into Wakanda. This allowing him to control all things metal, making the world his weapon. This forces all the world's heroes to attempt to combat this. Meanwhile, Shuri has gathered all their forces to the borders of Latveria and Symkaria. Officially, she is on a diplomatic mission to the latter to advise them on terrorism, when actually, they are enclosing on Latveria. Inside Castle Doom, the Midnight Angel launch their attack, disrupting Doom's connection to all the world's vibranium, and assisting Deadpool in their attempt to kill him. Doom take note that their weapons aren't vibranium, but steel laced with shadow particles. He compliment T'Challa for such an unexpected move, but say that it's too late to stop him. Deadpool then pulls out a radio transmitter, saying that someone wants to talk to Doom. It is Shuri, calling out to Doom to face her, ruler to ruler. Despite the Broker's warning that it is a trap, Doom is intent on running into it and defeat the opposition. Taking an army of his Doombots, he goes out to face his foes. T'Challa tells Doom that despite everything he has done, he's asking for the sake of peace and sanity for him to stand down. Doom merely laughs at those words, especially coming from someone who spilled a river of blood, who can't understand his motivations. But T'Challa retorts that he does. He explains that the Panther God came to him in his dreams and told him of a better future for the world with Doom ruling it. But he rejected that future, and states that now they will forge a better future for the world. Doom accepts the challenge and orders his legions to attack. Doom himself goes head-to-head with T'Challa taunting him for his country's dependence on the vibranium. But his hubris proved to be his downfall, as T'Challa admits that he may be right, before tapping into Doom's armor to connect to all the vibranium in the world and using it render all Wakandan vibranium inert and useless. Though Mr. Fantastic and Doom believe that Wakanda won't survive without the vibranium, Shuri believes that her brother saved his people. Storm then unleashes a powerful lightning storm that destroys all the Doombots. Planting the Wakandan flag before Doom, Shuri warns him that should he attack Wakanda again, she will not hesitate to kill him. The issue ends with their friends and allies rebuilding Wakanda.

It is just north of the A420 road between Swindon and Oxford. Original house The three-storey manor house dates back to the early 17th century. It is constructed mainly of Cotswold stone and surrounded by mature woodland. Within the extensive grounds there is a ha-ha. There is also a dovecote dating from 1619 which is purported to be the first square dovecote built in Berkshire. The house and dovecote are both Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. The house was probably built for John Southby who was High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1646/7 and MP for Berkshire in 1654/6. His family had lived on the site since 1584 and continued there until 1892. Victorian expansion and later history The buildings were extensively restored and remodelled between 1893 and 1898 by William Edward Graham Niven (1878–1915), a lawyer and architect, and the father of the actor David Niven, to be his country seat. The Niven family's crest and motto are still set in stone above the front porch. The Niven family sold the property shortly after David's birth. The house was bought by Captain Francis Mourilyan Butler and his wife Josephine (née Lawrence), an American heiress. In October 1917 Captain Butler was killed near Ypres during the Great War. His only son (Francis Charles Joseph Butler), born in 1915, was brought up at Carswell Manor and became a noted aviator. In June 1940, whilst serving as a Pilot Officer in the RAFVR, the younger Francis went missing in action. This situation prompted the legal case \\"Butler's Settlement Trust, Lloyds Bank Ltd. v. Ford\\" (as to whether being reported missing was sufficient evidence of death) and ultimately led to the sale of the property. There are memorials to both father and son in nearby Buckland church.

It is also one of the state's tourist attraction. The temple was listed in the Malaysian Book of Records as the first and only glass temple in the nation on 12 May 2010.All that glitters , New Straits Times, 5 November 2010. History The temple, one of Johor Bahru's oldest Hindu temples, is situated next to the railway tracks between Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and Jalan Mohd Taib (or close to the Tebrau Highway). It started in 1922 as a simple shelter on land presented by the Sultan of Johor. In 1991, Sri Sinnathamby Sivasamy, current temple chairman and chief priest, also known as Guru Bhagawan Sittar inherited the administration of the temple from his father. He is the inspiration and driving force behind the temple. The Guru made a commitment to rebuild the temple upon inheriting it from the humble hut it once was. In spite of difficulties and challenges, the temple was rebuilt and officially reopened in 1996. =Rebuilding in glass= The Guru had the inspiration to rebuild the temple in glass during one of his trips to Bangkok. He was in a tuk-tuk (auto-rickshaw) in Bangkok when he saw a light shining like a diamond, some away. The driver told him that it was a wat (temple). When he went there, he found that it was the glass artwork at the temple entrance that had caught his eyes. He was amazed that a small glass artwork could capture his attention from a vast distance. This inspired him to use this technique in the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Temple. He believed a temple fully embellished with impressive glass artwork will attract local devotees and visitors from the world over. Transformation of the temple with glass fittings started in 2008 and was completed in October 2009. Since then, it has become one of the state's major tourist attractions. Architecture The exterior of the temple, image taken by the Georgia National Guard. Light from crystal chandeliers is reflected on doors, pillars, walls and ceilings in a bright blaze that's quite blinding initially. At least 90 per cent of the temple is embellished by a mosaic of 300,000 pieces of red, blue, yellow, green, purple and white glass. The centrepiece in the Athma Lingam sanctuary is a lotus for Shiva, on which devotees can pour rose water and perform their prayers. Guru says this special sanctuary is the first in Malaysia to be designed with walls that are fully covered with 300,000 mukni Rudraksha beads from Nepal. At a glance, the walls appear to have an unusual embossed texture. Each Rudraksha bead is embedded in the walls with a chanted prayer. The fully air-conditioned temple has a café that serves vegetarian meals for special events, and a function hall in an adjoining building. Sculptures There are 10 gold-finished sculptures close to the ceiling. Of the two figures on the left, one appears to be lying down and the other crawling, while the one on the far right seems to be reclining too. These sculptures portray the cycle of life, from birth, youth, adulthood, to old age and death. There are 10 white marble statues standing tall each. According to the name plaques, these are Gautama Buddha, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sai Baba and Mother Teresa. The Guru believes that these are messengers of God, and visitors of other faiths will be happy to see them here. Murals On the left wing, there are two large panels on the ceiling painted by specially commissioned artists to convey a universal message of social and racial harmony. In one picture, a cow is next to an Indian girl, a dog is near a Chinese girl while a Malay girl holds a cat in her arms. The other picture has a Hindu motorcyclist being helped up by a Muslim after he fell off his bike, while a Buddhist is picking up his helmet and a Christian is lifting up the motorcycle. Location and Opening Hours The temple, located in 22 Lorong 1, Jalan Tebrau, Johor Baru, is accessible through Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and the lane that borders Gim Shew Building. Car and coach parking is available and there's also a shoe storage service. It is open for devotees from 7am to 10pm daily, while visiting hours for tourists are between 1pm and 5pm.

Mervyn Peake The Blue Elephant has forged a reputation for staging little-known works by Mervyn Peake. On Wednesday 4 June 2008 the theatre hosted a talk by Sebastian Peake, son of Mervyn Peake. A script by Mervyn Peake, The Cave, was given a rehearsed reading at the theatre by Flat Pack Productions on 21 June 2009. Following this the Blue Elephant staged the world premiere production of The Cave in October 2010,Review of The Cave directed by Aaron Paterson. As part of the Mervyn Peake centenary celebrations (2011) the theatre held a rehearsed reading of Peake’s play, Noah's Ark (26 April), a rehearsed reading – a premiere – of his play, Mr Loftus, or A Horse of Air (27 April) and a reading of a selection of poems by Peake (28 April).Mervyn Peake home Following the success of these readings the theatre staged the Theatre Premiere of Noah's Ark which had previously been produced on BBC radio in the 1970s. This production was directed by Mhairi Grealis, who had also staged its rehearsed reading, and it was one of three productions shortlisted for offwestend.com's award for Best Production for Young People that year. On Friday 10 May 2013, the Blue Elephant presented a scratch work-in-progress theatre adaptation of Peake's novella \\"Boy in Darkness\\", performed by Gareth Murphy. Boy in Darkness Following a successful scratch performance, and a work in progress one-hour showing co-directed by Aaron Patterson, Gareth worked upon adapting a further version of Peake’s novella Boy in Darkness into a full stage performance, which ran from 11 March to 4 April 2015. The piece adapted and performed by Gareth Murphy in which he played the Boy, goat, hyena and lamb, as well as a central storytelling character, was at this stage in its process directed by John Walton. It was well received, achieving four stars and being described as “a physical theatre gem” by The Stage, while A Younger Theatre said \\"Physical eloquence and bold storytelling do justice to Peake’s fantasy realm.\\" The production is set to tour the UK in 2016. Children in Need Celebrity Choir In 2014, BBC Children in Need approached the Blue Elephant, offering places for eleven young people from the theatre to join the celebrity choir formed by Gareth Malone to record a cover of Avicii's \\"Wake Me Up\\".

It was first named by John R. Bolt and R. Eric Lombard in 2010 and the type species is Deltaherpeton hiemstrae. Deltaherpeton can be differentiated from other colosteids due to possessing several unique bones along the midline of the skull, separating paired skull bones which typically contact each other along the midline. These include an internasal, an oval-shaped bone which lies at the intersection of the paired premaxillae and nasal bones at the top of the snout. Internasals are known from several of the earliest four-limbed vertebrates, such as Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, and baphetids. Further back, what seems to be a pair of lozenge-shape bones lie at the intersection of the nasal bones and frontal bones. These bones may be interfrontonasals, which have been found in some eryopoids and microsaurs. In addition, Deltaherpeton has a single postparietal (rather than a pair), which separates the left and right supratemporal and tabular bones at the rear edge of the skull. Lone postparietals are rare among non-amniote tetrapods and tetrapod relatives; only Ichthyostega and diadectomorphs are known to possess them. The discovery of Deltaherpeton prompted a review and re-augmentation of the defining characteristics for the family Colosteidae, though it did not help to clarify the relationship between colosteids and other early tetrapods. Though it is believed that Deltaherpeton is more derived, the species is thought to have shared its environment with other early four-limbed vertebrates such as Whatcheeria and Siguornea, approximately 339.4 to 336 million years ago.https://www.dinosaurhome.com/creature-feature-8-whatcheeria- deltae-14925.html  References  Category:Carboniferous tetrapods of North America Category:Mississippian animals Category:Prehistoric tetrapod genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 2010 ","title":"Deltaherpeton"},{"id":"29483277","text":"Acrocercops aeglophanes is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

Plaque memorializing federal personnel at the time of construction. The Ketchikan Federal Building is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, located at 648 Mission Street in Ketchikan, Alaska. It was completed in 1938, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on . The building's primary tenant is the United States Forest Service Tongass National Forest Supervisor's Office, which occupies space on the first, second, third, fourth and sixth floors. The fifth floor houses a courtroom and related support offices, while the first floor also houses an office of the United States Customs and Border Protection. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Significance The beginnings of the Ketchikan Federal Building can be traced back to 1924 when the City of Ketchikan was constructing a new school house and little space was left on the school lot for playgrounds. The U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1905, was located directly across the street and was apparently in \\"disrepair, inadequate for present needs, and unfavorably located in a residence section with its jail in close proximity to the school\\". The Ketchikan Women's Council developed a proposal where the City of Ketchikan agreed to donate a site for a new federal building, centrally located in the business district of the city, in exchange for the courthouse site to be used for a school playground.General Services Administration page on the Federal Building, Ketchikan, Alaska. On July 16, 1924 the Common Council of the City of Ketchikan adopted a memorandum to petition the federal government to make \\"ample appropriations\\" for the erection of a new courthouse or federal building. Copies of the memorandum were sent to the office of the Attorney General, the Treasury Department and the Committee on Territories in both the House and the Senate. The ground- breaking ceremonies on March 3, 1937 marked the end of years of continuous struggle by local agencies to obtain a new federal building. The building was designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Garfield, Stanley-Brown, Harris and Robinson. The J.B. Warrack Construction Company was awarded the building contract of $320,000, not including the elevator, fixtures and furnishings. The building officially opened on March 5, 1938, a year and a day after ground was first broken. Five times larger than the average federal building in cities of a population of 5,000, the building originally housed 11 governmental departments, services and bureaus. The post office occupied the entire L-shaped first floor, with service and lock box lobbies spanning the length of each wing. The district courtroom, offices and jail cells were located on the fifth floor. In the 1950s, the movie Cry Vengeance was filmed in the Ketchikan Federal Building and the original layout of the first floor lobby can be seen in some of the scenes. General Services Administration acquired ownership of the building in 1976, after postal services were relocated to a new facility. In 1977-1978, GSA totally remodeled the building to create modern office space; and additional minor remodeling has occurred since. Remodeling has removed much of the historical significance on the 1st and 4th floors, the old jail space in the southern half of the 5th floor, and much of the private office space on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Intact historical interior elements include window trim; some doors, frames and trim; the entry vestibule floor and wall finishes; the courtroom and adjacent lobby, judge's chambers, and clerk of court's office; the elevator doors; and the northeast stair. Of interest in the former jail cell area are four murals painted directly on the concrete block walls. These murals are believed to have been transferred from magazines and painted by prisoners who were members of the Tlingit and Haida Alaskan Indian tribes in the early 1980s. The murals are protected by Plexiglas panels and available for limited viewing, located in a private office. The exterior of the original building is largely intact, except where a new two-story wing was added at the west side of the south end of the original six-story tower. Windows were removed and openings infilled at a new stair added at the south end of the tower, and an insensitively-designed bump-out housing the stair's exterior vestibule was added at the first floor on the south end of the tower. Replacement windows, although not exact duplicates of the original design, match the original material (wood) and proportions. The exterior paint colors were originally white; the current pink and beige colors are not original. Architectural description Local newspaper articles at the time of its dedication described the Federal Building in Ketchikan, Alaska as \\"inside and out, the structure is plain and practical.\\" The six-story, L-shaped building was constructed of cast-in-place reinforced concrete on a structural foundation of driven steel piles with concrete caps. Designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Garfield, Stanley-Brown, Harris and Robinson; the plain, box-like exterior, flat roofs, and lack of ornament identify the Federal Building as International Style architecture. and Pioneered by European architects shortly after World War I, the International Style rejected the ornate designs of previous eras, turning instead to a streamlined, modern approach for buildings. Walls were flat planes with no decorative treatment and windows were placed flush to the exterior. This style became widely accepted in the United States in the mid-1930s. The building also represents a regional construction type and style known within Federal organizations as New Deal Concrete. A number of federal buildings built under Roosevelt's New Deal plan exhibit similar characteristics. The Federal Building is located at the southwest corner of Mission and Stedman Streets in downtown Ketchikan. The site is bounded by concrete sidewalks and grassy lawns on the northwest and northeast sides, and by paved concrete parking lots on the southeast and southwest. The northwest lawn features a metal flagpole with a concrete base, one of two originals. After almost four decades of grass bounded by chain link fencing, in the mid 1970s, landscaping was added and the fencing removed at the northeast and northwest lawns at Stedman and Mission Streets. The original steps at the main entry have been altered by the addition of a functional but insensitively designed off-center ramp with painted free-standing metal handrails. The L-shaped building consists of a long and narrow six-story tower stretching along Stedman Street to the northeast, with the narrow end of the tower and a one-story wing facing Mission Street to the northwest. The inside of the \\"L\\" originally included a basement level boiler room. While the main blocks of the building have remained intact; in 1954, a one- and two-story wing was added to the southeast side, east end of the main tower, adjacent to the boiler room. This addition has metal panel and stucco exterior finishes. The original building sits on a slightly projecting concrete base. The concrete wall surfaces have a rubbed finish and are smooth except for continuous horizontal reveals at the heights of window sills and heads on each floor level. The building is terminated by a slightly recessed continuous concrete parapet cap. The exterior elevations are penetrated by grouped window openings which align vertically and horizontally, from floor-to-floor. The original horizontal- light, two-over-two, wood double-hung sash windows, some with matching transoms, have been replaced by new, single-light, one-over-one, wood units with operable awning sash below fixed upper sash(es). The building was painted pink in 1990, at the request of the newly built Cape Fox Lodge; the color was decided upon by a local committee. The exterior concrete and paint is deteriorated. A study has recently been completed, identifying deficiencies and recommendations for improvement. The main building entrance is centered on the narrow northwest face of the six-story tower. The main entry doors are framed by a slightly protruding concrete surround that matches the base element. Two wrought-iron coach-lights (not original) are located at the sides of the entry doors and original cast bronze letters reading \\"FEDERAL BUILDING KETCHIKAN ALASKA\\" are located directly above the doors. The commemorative granite corner stone is located near the east end of the north wall. The original interior of the building continued the simple and practical theme. The most significant spaces were the postal lobbies on the first floor, and the courtroom and lobby on the fifth floor. Due to substantial renovation work in the 1970s, only the fifth floor courtroom and its lobby retains their original integrity.

Career In 1983, he returned to New York City to work at Garrick-Aug Associates, a Manhattan retail brokerage firm, where he earned $250 a week as a retail-store canvasser, making cold calls to landlords that had retail space for rent. He was quite successful and was soon promoted to salesman. By 1993, he was running Garrick-Aug's New York City operations. In 1998, after noticing that very few real estate firms specialized exclusively on the retail sector (landlord and tenant representation, new construction, leasing, sales, and market analysis), Futterman founded Robert K.

Child life insurance policies typically:http://www.buy-globe-life.com *Are issued with face values between $5,000 and $50,000. *Are always issued without a required medical examination. *Have zero investment and zero interest rate risk associated with cash value growth. *Provide insurance coverage for a designated beneficiary. Child life insurance should not be confused with juvenile life insurance, which is issued with much larger face values (normally $100,000–$10,000,000) and is generally purchased for college savings, lifetime savings, estate planning and guaranteed insurability. Child life insurance has been criticized for causing a motive for murder of insured children. Forty-five coroners have stated that child life insurance is a motive to murder. The Friendly Societies Act 1875 provided for payments on the death of children to pay the expenses of their burial. The London coroner, Braxton Hicks, wrote a letter to The Times in 1889 denouncing the practice of insuring children's lives because the insurances act as a temptation to the parents to neglect them, or feed them with improper food, and sometimes even to kill them. He gave evidence in 1890 to the Committee of the House of Lords investigating Child Life Insurance. The recent Deptford poisoning case, where Mrs Winters had poisoned three people and set up multiple insurance policies, was raised.

Although it only had a relatively short eighteen years of existence, it was awarded nearly forty million times. Its regulations were detailed and approved by decree number 5999-VIII of May 20, 1974. Its statute was amended by multiple successive decrees of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, first on June 8, 1977, then on August 12, 1983 and lastly on December 28, 1987. The medal ceased to be awarded following the December 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. Medal statute The Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" was awarded to workers for many years of hard work in the national economy, sciences, culture, education, healthcare, government agencies and public organizations. The medal was awarded to workers, farmers and employees in recognition of their lifelong labour on reaching the seniority required for a long-service pension or retirement age. Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR number 5822-IX of June 8, 1977 added the rank and file and the officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as potential recipients under the same award criteria as the labourers mentioned in the August 12, 1983 decree. Recommendations for award were made jointly by administrators of Party and trade union organizations, enterprises, institutions and organizations based on nominations from working groups or workforce councils. The list of potential recipients was then forwarded to municipal, district, or Party and government bodies for final approval. In the case of members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the list of nominations was forwarded to the Minister of Internal Affairs for final approval. Award ceremonies of the Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" usually took place in the work place of the recipients and were made on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union or of Autonomous Republics, the executive committees of regional and provincial Soviets, Moscow Soviet, Leningrad Soviet, or of the city Soviets of People's Deputies of the capitals of Soviet republics. The Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" was worn on the left side of the chest and in the presence of other medals of the USSR, immediately after the Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\\". If worn in the presence of awards of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence. Each medal came with an attestation of award, this attestation came in the form of a small 8 cm by 11 cm cardboard booklet bearing the award's name, the recipient's particulars and an official stamp and signature on the inside. Medal description The Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" was designed by artist SA Pomansky. It was a 34 mm in diameter circular medal struck from tombac and then silver-plated and oxidised. The obverse of the medal bears the relief image of the hammer and sickle over the inscription \\"USSR\\" () with diverging rays, a laurel branch spans the width of the obverse from right to left passing under the sickle's handle in an upward curve, along the lower and right circumference, a ribbon bearing the relief inscription \\"VETERAN OF LABOUR\\" (). The otherwise plain reverse bears the inscription on four lines \\"FOR LONG DILIGENT WORK\\" (). The Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\" was secured by a ring through the medal suspension loop to a standard Soviet pentagonal mount covered by a 24mm wide overlapping silk moiré ribbon with 1 mm wide white edge stripes and coloured from left to right by a 7 mm wide dark grey stripe, an 8 mm wide light grey stripe, and three 2 mm wide red stripes separated by two 0.5 mm wide white stripes. Apparently, there is a variation of the medal, being struck in silver as opposed to tombac, but this has not yet been verified.http://soviet-awards.com/medals22.htm#medal42 Recipients (partial list) The individuals below were all recipients of the Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\". * Test pilot Yury Garrievich Abramovich * Poet and bard Evgeny Danilovich Agranovich * Sculptor Zair Isaakovich Azgur * Painter and architect Valery Vladimirovich Androsov * Engineer Sergey Aleksandrovich Afanasyev * Economist Sopubek Begaliev * Aero engine engineer Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Boguslayev * Actress Elina Avraamovna Bystritskaya * Stage and a film actor Yevgeny Yakovlevich Vesnik * Rocket engine designer Valentin Petrovich Glushko * Rocket scientist Peter Dmitrievich Grushin * Mezzo-soprano singer Zara Aleksandrova Dolukhanova * Actor and writer Georgiy Stepanovich Zhzhonov * Theatre and cinema actor Vladimir Mikhailovich Zeldin * Former Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov * Folk singer Lyudmila Georgievna Zykina * Singer Iosif Davydovich Kobzon * People's Artist of the USSR composer Quddus Khodzham'iarovich Kuzhamiyarov * Director of civil aviation Nikolai Alexeyevich Kuznetsov * Gymnast and Olympic medalist Larisa Semyonovna Latynina * Ballerina Olga Vasilyevna Lepeshinskaya * Actress Nina Evgen'evna Menshikova * Historian Georg Vasilievich Myasnikov * Professor of Neurology Taisiya Sergeevna Osintseva * Film and television actor Viktor Pavlovich Pavlov * Scientist and optics engineer Vladimir Nikolayevich Polukhin * Twice Hero of the Soviet Union fighter pilot Vitaly Ivanovich Popkov * Physicist Alexander Mikhaylovich Prokhorov * Comic actor Mikhail Ivanovich Pugovkin * Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko * Actor Yevgeny Valerianovich Samoilov * Football player Nikita Pavlovic Simonyan * Museum director Lyudmila Andreevna Sorokina * Historian Valentin Lavrentievich Yanin * Composer and pianist Yakhin Rustem Mukhamet-Khazeyevich * Markiel Yagudayevich Gavrielov See also * Orders, decorations, and medals of the Soviet Union * Badges and Decorations of the Soviet Union References External links * Legal Library of the Soviet Union Category:Civil awards and decorations of the Soviet Union Category:Awards established in 1974 Category:Awards disestablished in 1991 Category:1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union Category:1974 establishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"Medal &quot;Veteran of Labour&quot;"},{"id":"29483497","text":"The Jeju Dog (Hangul: 제주개; Hanja: 濟州犬), which is also called Cheju Dog, Chaeju, and JejuGae, is a breed of dog that was brought back from the edge of extinction in 1986, when only three of them were found on the entire island of Jeju in South Korea. Since then, an aggressive campaign of breeding has yielded a current population of close to 300. However, the ‘pure bred’ Jeju Dog population is only estimated to be at about 69 as of September 2010. In 2010, Korea designated the Jeju Dog as a national heritage animal, which will allow for subsequent national protection. Before this, not enough animals remained to allow for such a distinction. Protection initiatives include a 2017 auction held by the Jeju Livestock Institute for those interested in adopting one of the 20 puppies. According to the institute, the goal was to continue to breed and preserve the Jeju Dog after being criticized for selling the puppies. Characteristics The dog is considered the largest dog breed indigenous to Korea. The dog breed is usually 49–55 centimeter long, 12–16 kilogram in weight and has an average lifespan of 15 years.사냥에 쓰이다 일제때 공출,진돗개와 달리 꼬리 세워, 현재 81마리… 연내 두배로 Jeju Dogs have wide and pointed foreheads. In many ways, the females look like foxes in terms of their length and width, while the males look almost identical to wolves. They are also similar to the Korean Jindo Dogs in terms of color and size. The primary difference being that Jeju Dogs have tails that are pointed up like brooms. They have tawny brown hair. In terms of disposition, they make loyal guard dogs. The Jeju Dogs have an acute sense of smell and hearing and are curious, and aggressive when ordered to attack a prey, making them ideal hunting companions. They have been known to hunt pheasants, deer, and badgers. History Jeju dogs may have originated in China, moved south along the peninsula, and came to Jeju Island some 3,000 years ago. Who brought the animals to the island and what their original purpose was are unclear. Moreover, when Jeju Dogs were brought to South Korea, they became military dogs, and when no longer military, people often ate them, which is the primary cause of the breed being endangered. Some sources cite how the Japanese during the Korean colonization ordered the slaughter of dogs indigenous to Korea and contributed to the near-extinction of the breed. After multiple tests of Jeju Dog genes and descent analysis, animal husbandry in Korea is (2010) planning to request them to be nominated as the Korean National Monument.

Retrieved from ancestry.co.uk, 5 November 2010 Mungo-Park's father, Colin, had joined the British Army at the start of the First World War as a private with the 7th Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment. On 24 October 1918, just seven months after his son's birth, Lance Corporal Colin Park was killed in action during the Hundred Days Offensive. He is buried in the Valenciennes (St Roch) Military Cemetery in France.http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/577794 John Mungo-Park was educated as a boarder at Liverpool College, where he was a successful athlete and sportsman. 'Mungo' had been a family forename for many generations, and he used the surname Mungo-Park from his schooldays onward. The family moved to Bolton in 1934, where a neighbour had a pilot's licence and keen interest in aviation. He and Mungo-Park became firm friends, and it was here that the passion for flying was born. Royal Air Force Mungo-Park joined the Royal Air Force on a short service commission in June 1937 and was made acting pilot officer on 9 August. He was confirmed as a pilot officer on 31 May 1938, and was posted to the Anti Aircraft Co-operation Unit of the Fleet Air Arm at Lee on Solent and then in August 1938 to flying Fairey Swordfish. The day after war was declared in September 1939, Mungo-Park transferred to No. 74 Squadron RAF flying Spitfires from RAF Hornchurch, commanded by Sailor Malan. He was promoted to flying officer 31 December. On 24 May 1940, while No. 74 Squadron were providing cover for the British retreat from France and the Dunkirk evacuation, Mungo-Park was wounded and his Spitfire damaged during an engagement with a Henschel Hs 126, but he managed to recross the Channel and land at RAF Rochford. On 10 July the squadron was engaged a large formation of Dornier Do-17s and their escort of Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Mungo claimed one Dornier, which he saw \\"turn lazily on its back and dive into the sea\\". On 11 August he was involved in four major air battles. During the first of these Mungo scored one Bf 109 destroyed and one damaged. In the day's third combat, over a convoy 'Booty' off Clacton, Mungo attacked two Bf 110s in quick succession and saw the first crash into the sea and the second go down pouring black smoke. He was awarded one 'destroyed' and 'one probable'. One further victory followed in the day's fourth air battle over Hawkinge, when his section was vectored onto a formation of Ju87s and Bf 109s off Margate. He led the attack on the 109s and his five-second burst into one of the fighters caused it to burst into flames and plunge into the sea. On 13 August No. 74 Squadron were vectored over the Thames Estuary onto an unescorted formation of Dornier 17s. Mungo claimed one destroyed amongst a squadron total of fourteen enemy aircraft claimed destroyed or probably destroyed. On 20 October he claimed the Bf 109E-7B Werk # 2059 \\"Brown 8\\" flown by Uffz. Franz Maierl (3.(J)/LG 2) who crashed at Chapel Farm, Lenham Heath, Kent.http://www.aircrewremembered.com/KrackerDatabase/?q=Mungo He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 15 November 1940. The citation read: Now recognised as one of the cream of the Allied fighter pilots, he was one of the fraction of The Few selected by Fighter Command to have a portrait drawn by Cuthbert Orde, sitting for it in December 1940. On 14 November 1940 No. 74 Squadron claimed a total of 13 Ju 87s in a mass dogfight over Dover, Mungo- Park personally claiming two. On 30 November he and Flight Lieutenant H.M. Stephen jointly claimed a Bf 109 (of Uffz. Wagelin 5./JG 53) that was deemed the 600th victory claimed by squadrons flying from RAF Biggin Hill. Exactly a year since his last promotion, on 31 December 1940, he was promoted to flight lieutenant On 10 March 1941 Sailor Malan was promoted, and Mungo-Park became acting squadron leader. On 16 June 1941 while on a sweep (\\"Circus 14\\") over the Channel he shot down two Messerschmitt Bf 109s, but in the fight his plane was damaged. He turned for home but his engine seized as he crossed the coast. Nonetheless, Mungo-Park managed to stay airborne, gliding his Spitfire back to RAF Hawkinge. For this display of skill, as well as his continued leadership and growing tally of kills, he was told he was to receive a Bar to his DFC. On the evening of 27 June 1941, flying Spitfire Vb X4668, Mungo-Park was part of an escort for a bombing raid over northern France coded 'Circus 25'. They were attacked by two formations of Bf 109s, led by Rolf Pingel of I./JG 26 (who had been spared by Bob Doe during the Battle of Britain) and Wilhelm Balthasar of JG 2. He was shot down and killed when his plane crashed just north of Dunkirk, a couple of miles over the Belgian border. He is buried in Adinkerke Military Cemetery, about 60 miles north of his father. In a twist of fate, Wilhelm Balthasar died in an air crash less than a week later and was buried in a Flanders cemetery alongside his father who had been killed in the First World War. A Bar to Mungo-Park's DFC was announced posthumously on 11 July 1941 with the citation: Mungo-Park had claimed 11 aircraft destroyed (and 2 shared), 5 probables, and 4 damaged.Aces High, Shores & Williams, page 456 Memorials Thanks to the efforts of Belgian Johny Recour, who had witnessed Mungo-Park's crash as a boy, a memorial service was held on 22 May 2006. Mungo Park Way in Orpington, Mungo Park Road in South Hornchurch and Mungo Park Close in Bushey are named after John Mungo-Park. In all three places, other roads in the surrounding estates are also named after pilots in the Battle of Britain.

Conventionally, for instance in Protestant music of the Baroque era, the vox Christi is set for a bass voice. In Protestant Germany the words of the vox Christi are in German: when the vocal work contains a sung Gospel reading, such as in Bach's Passions, the words are taken from Luther's Bible translation, but the words may also be free verse, as for instance in the Brockes Passion. In either case the composition may also contain a setting of an Evangelist's words, which are traditionally set for a tenor voice. Apart from a difference in voice type, settings of Jesus' words in recitatives can be further differentiated from surrounding text settings by, for instance, giving them a more arioso character, or setting them accompagnato (while the Evangelist and other characters sing secco). Passions and Oratorios of the first half of the 18th century Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet is a St Mark Passion which originated in Hamburg in the first decade of the 18th century. Johann Sebastian Bach's first staging of this Passion music was in Weimar 1712. Its vox Christi bass appears in secco and accompagnato recitatives, and in an arioso on the Gospel words \\"Eli, eli, lama asabthani\\".Gilles Cantagrel, translated by Charles Johnston. liner notes of Markuspassion Mirare 2015, p. 31 In his Brockes Passion George Frideric Handel set Jesus' words for bass in recitatives, ariosos and arias. The Evangelist's recitatives are set for tenor. In Bach's extant Passion compositions the vox Christi bass combines with an Evangelist's tenor voice. The Evangelist narrates the story in the Gospel's exact words in recitative secco. In the St John Passion the words of Jesus are set as recitatives secco leaning toward arioso. In the St Matthew Passion they are in accompanied recitative, that is they are additionally highlighted by an accompaniment of strings and basso continuo. The Vox Christi also appears in Bach's Christmas Oratorio, and in his Ascension Oratorio. Bach's cantatas In Bach's church cantatas the vox Christi may utter either literal words from the Bible which are neither direct quotes of or even attributed to Christ but are presented in the context of the musical work as being made by Christ, or extra-biblical words, for example in a dialogue between the Bridegroom (Christ) and the Bride (the Soul), or in an address to the Bride. In Bach's Weimar cantatas (1714–1716): * In Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, (25 March 1714), Bach's first cantata in Weimar, for Palm Sunday coinciding with Annunciation, verses from a Psalm are treated as if Jesus said them, set as the only recitative of the cantata, expanding to an Arioso: \\"Siehe, ich komme, im Buch ist von mir geschrieben\\" (\\"Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me, I delight to do thy will.\\" . * In Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172 (20 May 1714) for Pentecost the bass sings the words of Christ from the Gospel of John: \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (\\"If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\\" . * In Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61, (2 December 1714) the bass sings the words of Christ from the Book of Revelation: \\"Siehe, ich stehe vor der Tür und klopfe an. So jemand meine Stimme hören wird und die Tür auftun, zu dem werde ich eingehen und das Abendmahl mit ihm halten und er mit mir.\\" (\\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. \\" . * In Barmherziges Herze der ewigen Liebe, BWV 185, (14 July 1715), the bass summarizes admonitions from the Sermon on the Mount, all introduced by the keywords \\"Das ist der Christen Kunst\\" (That is the Christian art). * In Bereitet die Wege, bereitet die Bahn, BWV 132, (22 December 1715) the question Wer bist du? (Who are you), posed to St. John in the Gospel, is given to the bass, as if Jesus asked the listener this question. * In Mein Gott, wie lang, ach lange? BWV 155, (19 January 1716) serious questions get answered by words of consolation, sung by the bass as the vox Christi, almost as an arioso on the words \\"Damit sein Gnadenlicht dir desto lieblicher erscheine\\" (so that the light of His grace might shine on you all the more brightly). In Bach's first cantata cycle (1723–1724): * In Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe, BWV 22 (7 February 1723, Oculi Sunday), the cantata starts with a scene from the Gospel, the announcement of suffering in Jerusalem, quoting . The tenor as the Evangelist begins the narration from the verse 31, ' (Jesus gathered the twelve to Himself). The bass sings the announcement of the suffering, ' (Behold, we go up to Jerusalem), A choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples. * In O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60, (7 November 1723) the bass as the voice of Christ answers in dialogue a recitative of the tormented Fear three times with Selig sind die Toten. * In Schau, lieber Gott, wie meine Feind, BWV 153, (2 January 1724) the Bible word from , \\"Fürchte dich nicht, ich bin mit dir\\" (\\"Fear not, I am with you\\"), is given to the bass as the vox Christi, as if Jesus said it himself. * In Mein liebster Jesus ist verloren, BWV 154, (9 January 1724) the bass sings in an arioso the answer of Jesus, found in the temple 12 years old, to the questioning of his desperate parents: \\"Wisset ihr nicht, daß ich sein muß in dem, das meines Vaters ist?\\" (\\"Do you not know that I must be in that which is My Father's?\\", . * In Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen? BWV 81, (30 January 1724) the bass sings in an arioso, central within the cantata, the question of Jesus: \\"Ihr Kleingläubigen, warum seid ihr so furchtsam?\\" (Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?), . * The sixth movement of Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ, BWV 67, (16 April 1724) is an \\"operatic scene\\", with the bass serenely repeating the words of Jesus from the Gospel, \\"Peace be with you\\", four times (three times each), contrasted by agitated choral answers which see Jesus as help in the battle, in strengthening of the weary in spirit and body, and in overcoming death. * Cantata Wo gehest du hin? BWV 166, (7 May 1724) is opened by the bass singing a quote from the gospel, the third Farewell discourse, but turned into a general question about the direction of life. * In the cantata Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch, BWV 86, (14 May 1724) the bass sings in the opening movement three times the promise from the farewell discourse of Jesus: \\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you\\" (). Bach uses the Vox Christi in several cantatas of his second cycle (1724–1725): * In chorale cantatas composed in his second year in Leipzig:  In the cantata Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam, BWV 7, for St. John's Day (24 John 1724), a recitative referring to the command to baptise is set as an expressive arioso, accompanied by strings, similar to the words of Jesus in Bach's St Matthew Passion.  In Jesu, der du meine Seele, BWV 78, (10 September 1724) a bass recitative is accompanied by strings, Die Wunden, Nägel, Kron und Grab (\\"The wounds, nails, crown and grave\\"), reminiscent of the vox Christi in Bach's St. Matthew Passion. * In other cantatas of the second cycle:  In the first movement of Ich bin ein guter Hirt, BWV 85, (15 April 1725), the bass sings \\"I am a good shepherd\\" from the Gospel.  In the unusual first movement of Ihr werdet weinen und heulen, BWV 103, (22 April 1725), Bach inserted an almost operatic recitative of Jesus in the fugal choral singing.  In the first movement of Es ist euch gut, daß ich hingehe, BWV 108, (29 April 1725), the bass sings a quote from the Gospel, \\"It is good for you that I leave\\".  Jesus speaks twice in Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, (6 May 1725), in movement 1 accompanied by strings, doubled by oboes, in movement 5 accompanied by the continuo: \\"In the world you have fear; however be comforted, I have conquered the world.\\"  In the first movement of Sie werden euch in den Bann tun, BWV 183, (13 May 1725), the announcement of Jesus from the second Farewell discourse is set as a recitative of only five measures, accompanied by long chords of the four oboes, two oboi da caccia and two oboi d'amore on a pedal point of the continuo, creating a \\"sepulchral\\" sound. The last four of these were on a libretto by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler From Bach's third cantata cycle (1725–1726): * Selig ist der Mann, BWV 57, (26 December 1725) is a dialogue of the Anima and Jesus. * The central movement of Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot, BWV 39, (23 June 1726) is a line from the Epistle to the Hebrews 13:16, Wohlzutun und mitzuteilen vergesset nicht (\\"To do good and to share, forget no\\"). Bach treats it, as if Jesus said the words himself, between arioso and aria. * In Siehe, ich will viel Fischer aussenden, BWV 88 (21 July 1726, 5th Sunday after Trinity), the Evangelist begins part 2 with a recitative on , \\"Jesus sprach zu Simon\\" (Jesus said to Simon), the following direct speech of Jesus, calling Peter as his disciple, is sung by the bass: \\"Fürchte dich nicht; den von nun an wirst du Menschen fahen\\" (Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men). * In the central movement of Es ist dir gesagt, Mensch, was gut ist, BWV 45, (11. August 1726) beginning Part II, the voice of Christ appears in a \\"highly virtuosic aria, half Vivaldian concerto, half operatic scena\\", according to John Eliot Gardiner. * The central movement of Es wartet alles auf dich, BWV 187, (4 August 1726) is Darum sollt ihr nicht sorgen (\\"Therefore do not be anxious\\") from the sermon on the mount. The words of Jesus are sung by the bass, accompanied by the violins in unison and the continuo, which also takes part in their motifs. * In Herr, deine Augen sehen nach dem Glauben, BWV 102, (25 August 1726) Bach himself marked movement 4 for bass Arioso on words from the Epistle to the Romans 2:4—5, Verachtest du den Reichtum seiner Gnade (\\"Do you scorn the riches of His mercy\\").Alfred Dürr. 1971. \\"Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach\\", Bärenreiter 1999, (in German) * In Ich geh und suche mit Verlangen, BWV 49, (3 November 1726), a cantata for soprano and bass soloists which is termed a Dialogus between the Bride (the Soul) and the Bridegroom (Jesus), the soprano is the Bride and the bass, the vox Christi, is the Bridegroom. Later additions to the chorale cantata cycle: * In Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140, (25 November 1731) Jesus \\"appears\\" with the \\"Soul\\" in movement 3, a duet for soprano and bass, Wann kommst du, mein Heil? (\\"When will you come, my salvation?\\"). * In Es ist das Heil uns kommen her, BWV 9 (composed between 1732 and 1735), three bass recitatives based on stanzas of the chorale can be considered a sermon on the Lutheran creed, based on the Sermon on the Mount. In one of the other late church cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach: * In Schwingt freudig euch empor, BWV 36, (2 December 1731) in the bass aria beginning part II, \\"Willkommen, werter Schatz!\\" (Welcome, worthy treasure!) the bass voice is the vox Christi, addressing the bride.

He is well known for issuing a collection of fatwas that became highly influential in Hanafi (one of four major schools of thought in Sunni Islam) jurisprudence in the 18th and 19th centuries.Fay, p. 12Gerber, 1994, pp. 83-84 Early life and Islamic studies Khayr al-Din al-Ramli was born in al-Ramla in Ottoman Palestine. At that time, al-Ramla was a major garrison town (and in the early years of Islamic rule it had been the administrative capital of the Jund Filastin, or military district of Palestine). Al-Ramli receives his name from the town; al-Ramli translates as \\"from Ramla.\\" Not much is known about al-Ramli's early life other than he began reading the Qur'an as young child.Fay, p. 13 In 1598-99 CE, al-Ramli traveled to Egypt with his elder brothers to study in al-Azhar, the highest scholarly authority in Sunni Islam. There he befriended Sheikh Fayed, a well-known sage in Egypt. Fayed taught him lessons on Islam as well as how to cut hair. At the time, al-Ramli was interested in studying the Shafi'i school of Sunni Muslim thought (madhab), but was discouraged by his older brother, Taj al-Din, who preferred he focus on the Hanafi madhab. According to his biographer Muhammad al- Muhibbi, al-Ramli had a dream in which the founder of the Shafi'i madhab, Imam Shafi'i, stated to him \\"We are all on the straight path.\\" A senior figure in the 'ulema (council of scholars) of al-Azhar told al-Ramli that the dream signaled he should follow his brother's advice and study the Hanafi madhab. Muhibbi states that al-Ramli \\"worked hard\\" and \\"outdid\\" Taj al-Din, eventually gaining the attention of the lead scholar of al-Azhar, Sheikh Abdullah al- Nahiri. Al-Nahiri regularly invited al-Ramli and Taj al-Din to his home and gave them private lessons on the Hanafi thought. In 1603, al-Ramli graduated from al-Azhar and received honorary certificates from al-Nahiri as well as from another senior scholar, Sheikh Abd Allah. Prior to his return to al- Ramla, al-Ramli stopped in Gaza where he met the local 'ulema and the governor of the Gaza Sanjak, Ahmad ibn Ridwan. Ibn Ridwan was impressed by al-Ramli's new credentials and encouraged him to remain in Gaza which he did for a few months. Career Upon returning to al-Ramla in 1604, he began teaching the Hanafi madhab to the residents of the area. He rapidly began to acquire estates in and around the city which he used to plant thousands of orchards including olives, figs and other fruits. Although he did not receive funds from the Ottoman state nor from the waqf, al-Ramli ordered the rehabilitation of a number of mosques and shrines in the surrounding area. He also funded religious personnel and his students who came from various parts of the Ottoman Empire. It is understood that al-Ramli used the revenues of his agricultural pursuits to bankroll most of his financial activities, allowing him to become a philanthropist in his community. According to biographer Ibrahim al-Janini, he collected roughly 1,200 books with multiple copies which he provided to provincial officials, 'ulema, and sheikhs who requested them.Fay, p. 14 Al-Ramli immediately issued numerous fatawa once he settled in al-Ramla, although he was not officially appointed the position of mufti by the state. Nonetheless, his rulings—which apparently were able to override fatawa issued by official muftis—reportedly reached Jerusalem, Damascus, Mecca, Istanbul and the Maghreb (northwestern Africa). He awarded legal certificates of approval to several Muslim scholars from these places. According to Muhibbi, \\"anyone who asked received one, either orally or in written form.\\" Muhammad al-Ashari, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who adhered to the Shafi'i madhab, was one of many high-ranking Muslim jurists who requested a certificate from him. The muftis (Shafi'i and Hanafi) of Damascus and other major cities in Damascus Province would consult al-Ramli whenever problems arose regarding religious rulings. It was noted that even the Bedouin of the region who generally disregarded sharia law respected any fatwa issued by him due to cordial relations between them and al-Ramli.Fay, 15 During this time period, al-Ramli also began importing various seeds from Egypt, and introduced them to Ramla.Islahi, p. 37 Legacy Al-Ramli died in his hometown in 1671 at the age of 86. Al-Muhibbi described him as \\"the last of the great 'ulema.\\"Fay, 16 Al-Ramli's fatawa (\\"multiple edicts\\") were compiled into final form in 1670, in a collection entitled al-Fatawa al-Khayriyah. These fatawa are a contemporary record of the time, and also give a complex view of agrarian relations. Modern scholars are using his works to trace the path of embryonic territorial awareness, specifically that of Palestine.Gerber, 1998, p. 563 His fatawa reference the Roman province of Palaestina Prima, or as it was known in the early Islamic period, Jund Filastin. It was originally thought that term died out during the Mamluk and Ottoman states, as they did not use this concept, however, the way that al-Ramli used the term suggests otherwise.Gerber, 1998, p. 565 When it is brought up, he never defines the term, and uses it only in passing, suggesting that his audience would have an understanding of what he meant.Gerber, 1998, p. 566 Khayr al-Din al-Ramli is a descendant of Umar ibn al-Khattāb (Through his son Abdullah ibn Umar), the second Muslim Caliph after the prophet Muhammad's death. Today the Palestinian family, El Khairi-Farouki, trace back their ancestry to Khayr al-Din al Ramli.

The mine consists of a long, narrow gallery on either side of the leaf. It is more or less tortuous in direction, and generally up and down the long axis of the leaf. The colour of the early part of the mine is white, with a thin brown or black central line of frass. Later, it becomes a somewhat lighter green than the rest of the leaf-surface. This portion of the mine is loosely packed with fine frass granules. The cuticle over old mines rapidly dies and becomes brown. Badly infected leaves wither and fall from the tree. The final inch or so of the mine is often expanded into a somewhat irregular, narrow, elongated blotch.

The memorial was donated to the state of Indiana and dedicated in 1911 in honor of the Indiana politician, Robert Dale Owen (1807–1877). The bronze portrait bust by Indiana sculptor, Frances M. Goodwin, has been missing from this memorial since 1970. The memorial's remaining pedestal is made from three stone blocks and includes a commemorative plaque. Description The 200-pound bronze bust of a bearded Robert Dale Owen was once centered on the top of a stone pedestal; however, the bust is missing from the memorial. The remaining pedestal faces the south entrance of the Indiana Statehouse. It is composed of three stone blocks and stands 70 inches high. The lowest block is 45.5 inches wide, 42.5 inches deep, and 10 inches tall; the middle block measures 32 inches wide, 28.5 inches deep, and 10 inches tall; and the top block is 24 inches wide, 21.5 inches deep, and 50 tall. A memorial plaque, which is centered on the face in the middle of the top block and measures 20 inches by 24 inches, reads: :1801-1877 / An Appreciation / Erected in the honor of Robert Dale Owen by the Women of Indiana in recognition of his efforts to obtain for them educational privileges and legal rights. / author, statesman, politician, philanthropist / \\"Write me as one who loved his fellow man. Location In 1905, the Robert Dale Owen Memorial Association was granted permission from the Indiana state government to place a memorial to Owen in the rotunda of the Indiana Statehouse. The present-day memorial, which includes only the remaining pedestal, is installed on the Statehouse grounds, facing the southern entrance to the building. The memorial was dedicated in 1911. Historical information The artist at work In 1905, during the women's movement of the early twentieth century, fundraising efforts began to erect a memorial to Robert Dale Owen, who was known for his early legislative efforts in Indiana in the mid-1800s to protect women's property rights and provide women with greater freedom in divorce, as well as his support of women’s suffrage. See also: The memorial was also intended to draw attention to the ongoing struggle for women's suffrage. The Memorial Association hoped to raise $2,000 to $2,500 for the commission of a bust and memorial. Artist Frances Goodwin was chosen to create the bust. After Goodwin's clay model was approved by the Memorial Association and by Owen's son, Ernest Dale Owen, the final bronze bust was cast in Paris. Although the state government granted the Robert Dale Owen Memorial Association permission to place a memorial in the rotunda of the Statehouse in 1905, the completed work was not formally dedicated until 1911. The memorial was presented to the State of Indiana on March 8, 1911, \\"as a lasting memorial to a man who for many years persistently labored to secure just laws concerning the educational and property rights of women.\\" The governor of Indiana, members of the Indiana General Assembly, and Owen's great-grandniece, Martha Fitton, attended the dedication. The original memorial included Goowin's bronze portrait bust of Owen on a stone pedestal that included a commemorative plaque. On September 19, 1970, the portrait bust was stolen, and the present-day memorial is installed outside on the Statehouse grounds. It faces the southern entrance to the building where it was dedicated in 1911. =The Robert Dale Owen Memorial Association= The Federated Women's Club of Indiana formed the Robert Dale Owen Memorial Association on June 30, 1905, to urge the women of Indiana to help raise funds for a memorial to Robert Dale Owen. The Association consisted of ten women from Indiana, led by Julia Conklin. The group published at least two pamphlets that were distributed around the state to inform others about their efforts. Robert Dale Owen and What He Did for Women of Indiana offered a brief biography of the politician. Another pamphlet appealed to the women of the state to help in fundraising efforts, explained why women should care about a memorial for Owen, and presented many avenues for donation. The Association also offered to send its members to meetings of Indiana women's clubs to speak about the life and legacy of Robert Dale Owen in an effort to help raise funds for the memorial. George B. Lockwood sold autographed copies of his book, New Harmony Communities, and donated the proceeds to the cause. Julia Conklin did the same with her book, The Young People's History of Indiana. The Women's Club of New Harmony, Indiana, was the largest contributing group, raising $50 for the fund. In their final meeting on December 30, 1912, Association member Julia Sharpe presented her official record of the work accomplished by the group. The report included illustrations of each member of the Association and a reproduction of Goodwin's memorial bust. The Association gave a bound volume of the report to the Indiana State Library for future reference. Artist Frances Murphy Goodwin (1855–1929) was born in Newcastle, Indiana, and was a member of one of the city's oldest families. Goodwin and her sister, Helen, were well known in Indiana artist circles. Goodwin briefly attended The Indiana Art School before moving to the Art Institute of Chicago to study painting. At Chicago she discovered her love for sculpting and eventually worked as a student under the sculptor Lorado Taft. Goodwin also studied sculpture at the Art Student's League in New York City with the sculptor Daniel Chester French. Goodwin eventually traveled in Europe, where she studied art for four and a half years, and established an art studio in Paris with her sister. Goodwin died at Newcastle at the age of seventy-four. A year later, in 1930, the Henry County Historical Society planned to commission a memorial for their grounds dedicated to Frances Goodwin and modeled after a bird fountain she had created at the Newcastle Public Library. =Art career= Frances Goodwin's first commission was for Education, a sculpture displayed in the Indiana building at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, and earned an honorable mention for the work. The sculpture was later installed in the Office of the Governor of Indiana. Goodwin's other works include a marble statue of Schuyler Colfax in the Senate gallery at the U.S. Capitol and a bronze memorial of Captain Everet Benjamin in New York. Her busts of Newcastle poet, Benjamin S. Parker, and Indianapolis rector, Reverend James D. Stanley, displayed at the Historical Society of Henry County and the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis. Goodwin also sculpted many studies of baby hands, which were popular with the public. After living in Paris for a few years, she returned to the United State, when she won the competition for the commission of the Robert Dale Owen Memorial. Goodwin opened a temporary studio in Indianapolis, where she created the clay mold of the future artwork; however, she returned to Paris to cast the final bronze bust.

Its main focus is on the modeling of dynamic interaction networks of various sizes. The goal of the library is to provide a way to represent graphs and work on it. To this end, GraphStream proposes several graph classes that allow to model directed and undirected graphs, 1-graphs or p-graphs (a.k.a. multigraphs, that are graphs that can have several edges between two nodes). GraphStream allows to store any kind of data attribute on the graph elements: numbers, strings, or any object. Moreover, in addition, GraphStream provides a way to handle the graph evolution in time. This means handling the way nodes and edges are added and removed, and the way data attributes may appear, disappear and evolve. Stream Dynamics of graphs is modeled as stream of graph events. These events can be about the structure of the graph (add and remove elements) or about the attributes of elements (graph, node and edge attributes). center This is the list of events which can be found in GraphStream:Getting started * node/edge addition/deletion, * clear graph, * graph/node/edge attribute addition/change/deletion, * begin step. A stream is the connection between a source providing events and a sink. Sources can be anything able to produce events, for example a source reading a file, an algorithm generating a graph ... center Visualization GraphStream provides some features to display graphs. The rendering of elements can be customized by defining a CSS stylesheet for the graph being displayed. Viewer allows an automatic layout of nodes.

Magnus had been given a copy of a letter from John Stewart, Duke of Albany, Margaret's rival for power, giving Barton instructions on provisions for Dunbar Castle, which he believed to be a forgery. In English letters Robert's name regularly appears as \\"Hob a Barton.\\"State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 part 4 (1836), 213, Magnus & Radclyff to Wolsey, 2 November 1524. Barton was treasurer again in 1534. In 1536 James V prepared for Robert to accompany him on his trip to France. The King granted Robert exemption from any legal actions during their absence.

It was first described in 2010, by Xu et al., who created the binomial Zhuchengceratops inexpectus. The name is derived from the location of Zhucheng, the Latinized-Greek ceratops, or \\"horned face\\", and the unexpected articulated nature of the holotype. The skeleton was found in the Wangshi Group, which is of Late Cretaceous age, and most fossils are only disarticulated bones of Shantungosaurus. Zhuchengceratops shares may features with Leptoceratopsidae as well as other ceratopsian groups such as Ceratopsidae. The overall size of the taxon was similar to Leptoceratops, although slightly larger. Zhuchengceratops was analyzed to be in a group with Leptoceratops and Udanoceratops, although internal relationships of this triplet were unresolved. Discovery and naming Fossil skull and mandible Zhuchengceratops is a derived leptoceratopsid ceratopsian which lived during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Kugou, Zhucheng County, China. It is known from a partial articulated skeleton including vertebrae, ribs, teeth, and parts of the skull and mandibles. The fossils were recovered from the Wangshi Group, of the Late Cretaceous. This genus was named by Xing Xu, Kebai Wang, Xijin Zhao, Corwin Sullivan and Shuqing Chen in 2010, and the type species is Zhuchengceratops inexpectus. The genus name was chosen for the location of Zhucheng, where the holotype was found, and the Latinized-Greek ceraptops, meaning \\"horned face\\". They chose the species name inexpectus to refer to the unexpected discovery of the articulated skeleton. The recovered specimen of Zhuchengceratops likely represents an adult, and is slightly larger than most adults of the similar ceratopsian Leptoceratops, which was around 2 meters in length. Zhuchengceratops had a particularly massive and deep 50 cm-long mandible that is also thin transversely. This and a number of other autapomorphies unique to the genus lend it significance for increasing the morphological disparity and the taxonomic diversity of the Leptoceratopsidae. As the third leptoceratopsid from Asia, this find exhibits the coexistence and radiation of two closely related clades, whose differences in jaw and tooth adaptation may represent different feeding strategies.

He is also a professor at Peking University in Beijing. Early life Wang was born in the Yongdeng County in the Gansu Province of the People's Republic of China. Before becoming a reporter, Wang was a farmer in Gansu. It was here where he discovered journalism in the mid-80s. He received about (, or approximately ) for each article he wrote, or as he said, enough for six bowls of noodles. He began by writing propaganda stories for the local media. In 1989 he began working for the Gansu Economics Daily. After publishing his story that uncovered a fraudulent securities company, he was hired by the Beijing-based China Economic Times, where he worked as chief reporter until forced to resign in 2011 following the vaccines story. Journalism Wang is known for carrying a small box containing a sponge soaked in red ink, which he uses to collect fingerprints from witnesses to confirm their agreement on the witness statements he compiles. \\"You have to make the evidence iron-cast,\\" he explains. In 2002, Wang published a story exposing the \\"stranglehold\\" that Chinese taxi companies have on their drivers. This influenced Premier Wen Jiabao to order a cleanup of the taxi industry. On November 30, 2005, Wang published a story about an AIDS epidemic in the Henan province caused by poor sterilization of needles when collecting paid blood donations. On March 8, 2010, he and a student were physically and verbally attacked while trying to visit Yuan Weijing, wife of imprisoned civil and political rights activist Chen Guangcheng. As a result, Reporters Without Borders urged the Shandong provincial government to investigate the incident and stop it from reoccurring with other visitors. =Securities fraud story= On February 3, 2001, Wang published in the Gansu Economics Daily a \\"groundbreaking\\" report uncovering a huckster securities company that had defrauded customers of millions of dollars. The company had committed securities fraud by displaying stock tickers and computer screens with the names of real companies but with fake investment returns. On April 29 of the same year, the paper was closed down by the provincial publicity department because of this story. When the paper was allowed to reopen four months later, local officials told Wang that he was no longer allowed to work there. However, China Economic Times picked up the story and subsequently offered Wang a job as a senior reporter in January 2002. Publishing this story resulted in threats to both Wang and his family from the local mafia running the scam; he is sometimes referred to as \\"China's most expensive reporter\\" because of the $600,000 price put on his head. An internal report on his work from the Xinhua News Agency reached the Premier of the People's Republic of China at the time, Zhu Rongji, who ordered police protection for Wang and his family and brought Wang to Beijing so he could continue his journalism. =Vaccines story= On March 17, 2010, after six months of investigation, Wang published a story in China Economic Times exposing how a \\"gross failure\\" to refrigerate vaccines in the Shanxi province caused four children to die and 74 others to become ill. He reported that the vaccines were deliberately left unrefrigerated in order to stop the labels from peeling off. Shanxi officials claimed that Wang's story was incorrect, and within hours of publication, the report had been downplayed on other media outlets following orders from the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China. The chief editor, publisher, and Communist Party secretary of China Economic Times, Bao Yueyang, was fired after defending the report, and moved to a minor sister company. Wang was later warned that his life may be in danger if he returned to the Shanxi province. Suppression Wang has been forced to resign twice from major Chinese newspapers, from China Economic Times in 2011 and from The Economic Observer in February, 2013.

After being top scorer in the lower divisions for Tenerife B, he represented four teams in Segunda División, totalling 15 goals in 94 games. Club career =Tenerife= Born in Puerto de la Cruz, Canary Islands, Airam was formed at local CD Tenerife, and made his debut on loan at CD Laguna de Tenerife before playing for his parent club's reserves. In 2008–09, he was Tercera División's top scorer (Canarian group) with 23 goals, bettering that total by four to be crowned the overall Pichichi of Segunda División B the following season, although his team was relegated. The latter season's tally included four in a 5–1 home win over RSD Alcalá on 20 September 2009, and a hat-trick of penalty kicks the following 10 January in a 4–1 rout of neighbours UD Vecindario. =Villarreal / Córdoba= On 22 April 2010, Airam signed a two-year deal at Villarreal CF, with an option of a third. He was assigned to the B-side in Segunda División, and made his professional debut on 27 August when he started in a 0–3 loss at Real Valladolid. Eight days later he scored his first goal for the team, the sole one in their home win over Albacete Balompié; on 25 September, after coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Natxo Insa, he netted twice in a 3–2 success at Girona FC. On 31 January 2012, Airam terminated his Villarreal contract with minutes remaining of the transfer window, and joined fellow league team Córdoba CF for the remainder of the season. In his brief spell in Andalusia, he scored a brace in a 3–1 home win over SD Huesca on 10 March and helped the side to the promotion play-offs; he said at the end of his contract that he would have liked to remain at the Estadio Nuevo Arcángel. =Numancia / Lugo= Airam remained in the second division subsequently, signing a one- year deal at CD Numancia with the option of a second on 31 July 2012. He started only two league games for the team from Soria, without scoring, and left by mutual consent the following 10 January. Later that day, he joined CD Lugo still in the second level for the rest of the campaign. On 30 March 2013, Airam scored his only goals for the Galicians, a hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Xerez CD. =Cádiz= On 30 July 2013, Airam returned to division three for the first time in three years, agreeing to a three-year deal at Cádiz CF. His 23 goals in 32 games over his first season helped the club to the play- offs, and his 12 in 33 in the ensuing campaign helped them win their group. =Korona Kielce= On 2 June 2015, it was reported that Airam's first club Tenerife were interested in reacquiring his services. However, this scheme collapsed the following month, and as Cádiz also failed to gain promotion, he instead moved abroad for the first time by signing a one-year deal at Poland's Korona Kielce. Airam made his top flight debut on 11 September 2015, starting in a goalless draw at Lechia Gdańsk, and scored his first Ekstraklasa goal on 16 October, a penalty to win the game at Śląsk Wrocław. He netted his first hat-trick in Poland on 20 February 2016, in a 4–2 win over Gdańsk at the Stadion Miejski Kielce; despite the team finishing in the bottom half of the table, his tally of 16 goals was bettered only by Nemanja Nikolić of champions Legia Warsaw. =Anorthosis= Airam switched countries again on 10 August 2016, signing for Anorthosis Famagusta FC of the Cypriot First Division and teaming up with several compatriots including manager Antonio Puche. He made his debut on 11 September, replacing Esmaël Gonçalves after 59 minutes of the away fixture against Aris Limassol FC and scoring the 2–1 winner. =Extremadura= Airam returned to Spain's third tier on 8 July 2017, when he signed for Extremadura UD. In his first season, the team won an unprecedented promotion to the second division. In August 2018, Airam went back to Poland's top flight when he was loaned to KS Cracovia.

One of them, 20-year-old Chen Xiaofeng (), a student from Shijiazhuang at the Electronic Information Engineering College died later in the hospital. The other victim, Zhang Jingjing (), aged 19, remained in a stable condition, albeit suffering from a fractured left leg. The drunk driver, 22-year-old Li Qiming (), tried to escape the scene and continued driving to the female dormitory to drop off his girlfriend. When arrested by security guards, convinced his father's position would give him immunity, he shouted out, \\"Go ahead, sue me if you dare. My dad is Li Gang!\\" () After outrage erupted on Chinese internet forums, a doxing search revealed that Li Gang was the deputy director of the local public security bureau. Four days after the incident, an online poetry contest invited entrants to incorporate the sentence \\"My father is Li Gang\\" (我爸是李刚, pinyin: Wǒ bà shì Lǐ Gāng) into classical Chinese poems. The contest was created by a female blogger in northern China nicknamed Piggy Feet Beta on MOP, a popular Chinese bulletin board system. It received more than 6,000 submissions. The phrase has since become a popular catchphrase and internet meme within China, frequently seen on various forums and message boards, and in similar competitions using ad slogans and song lyrics, and used ironically in conversation by speakers trying to avoid responsibility. Communist Party officials tried at first to suppress reports of the incident, but their efforts backfired. During an interview with China Central Television on 21 October, Li Gang wept in an apology; then on 22 October, a video showing Li Qiming's apology was released. The apology was rejected by the victims' families, the elder brother of Chen Xiaofeng believing the apology to be a political stunt. The People's Daily, in an editorial published on October 26, urged authorities to take the affair into their own hands and shed light on the matter. On October 29, the South China Morning Post and other sources revealed that a directive from the Central Propaganda Department, issued on October 28, required that there be \\"no more hype regarding the disturbance over traffic at Hebei University,\\" and ordered Chinese newspapers to recall their reporters from Baoding. On November 1, Zhang Kai, the attorney for the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng, was abruptly asked to terminate his representation in the case, after the law firm was cautioned by the Beijing Bureau of Justice, according to a blog by Wang Keqin, an influential Chinese muckraking reporter, blogger and professor at Peking University. That same day, Director Liu of Baoding Traffic Police Division and some clerks from Wangdu County proposed payments to the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng to settle the case. On November 4, the Central Propaganda Department banned news of an interview by Phoenix Television with Ms. Chen's brother, Chen Lin, in which he was critical of the government. Then on November 9, Internet discussion of the case suddenly stopped. Local students and activists such as Ai Weiwei, however, continued to speak out. In January 2011, Li Qiming was arrested. He was sentenced to six years in jail and ordered to pay the equivalent of $69,900 in compensation to the family of Chen Xiaofeng. Li was also ordered to pay $13,800 to the injured woman.  Timeline  * October 16, 2010, around 21:40: Hebei Institute of Media student Li Qiming drove drunk and hit two female students, Chen Xiaofeng and Zhang Jingjing, after picking up his girlfriend.

As a result, the north aisle and the eastern part of the south aisle were destroyed. The roof of the nave was rebuilt in 1662, but the aisles were not fully restored at that time. In 1826 the chancel was repaired by Thomas Rickman, and it was further restored in 1846–47 by F. J. Francis. A major reconstruction of the church was undertaken from 1860 by W. Slater and R. H. Carpenter. They rebuilt the church in Geometrical style rather than in the Perpendicular style of the earlier church. In 1870–73 Slater and Carpenter substantially rebuilt the tower, this time in Perpendicular style. An octagonal library was added to the north side of the chancel in 1878. By the 1970s the tower had become unsafe, and in 1976 the church was declared redundant. It was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1980. Architecture =Exterior= St Leonard's is constructed in local red Bunter sandstone, and has clay tile roofs. Its plan consists of a rectangle comprising a five-bay nave with north and south aisles (the south aisle is one bay shorter) under separate roofs, a three-bay chancel with a roof at a lower level, a tower outside the west bay of the south aisle, and an octagonal library to the north of the chancel. The tower is in three stages separated by string courses, with diagonal buttresses, and a northwest polygonal stair turret with a crocketted spirelet. Its lower stage contains the entrance to the church through a south doorway leading into a porch. Above this is a large five-light window. In the middle stage is a statue of Saint Leonard in a niche. The top stage contains paired two-light bell openings. The parapet is embattled with eight crocketted pinnacles. Most of the windows in the aisles have three lights. At the west end of the nave is a doorway above which is a pair of three-light windows. The south wall of the chancel has three three-light windows, the central one being shorter and over a priest's door. The east window has four lights. On the north wall of the chancel are two windows, a squint, and a link to the library. The library has a pyramidal roof, and simple two-light mullioned windows, alternating with tall two-light dormers. =Interior= Inside the church there is a five-bay north arcade and a four-bay south arcade. The arcades are carried on circular piers with capitals carved with foliage by S. Poole. On the south side, one of the bays is divided by a pier. This has a carving of the Expulsion from Eden on its capital, and in the tympanum of the main arch is a carving in a roundel of the Annunciation to the shepherds; both are by James Redfern. In south wall of the chancel is a double piscina and a stepped sedilia. There are hammerbeam roofs in the nave, the south aisle, and the chancel. The north aisle has a tie-beam roof, and there is a lierne vault in the base of the tower. The walls of the nave and aisles are covered in red-brown plaster, while those in the tower and chancel are bare. The nave is floored with red and black tiles, with raised wooden floors under the pews. The chancel floor contains memorial mosaics and tiles, while the sanctuary has encaustic tiles. The font is octagonal, standing on marble shafts, with carved marble figures under canopies; it dates from 1894 and is by Thomas Earp. The font has a tall timber cover with pinnacles by J. Phillips of Liverpool dating from 1991. The polygonal wooden pulpit, made by James Forsyth in 1862, stands on a large stone base. It is carved with foliage and a roundel with Christ teaching his apostles. The elm lectern of 1929 is also by Phillips, and represents an angel with a trumpet. The reredos of 1882 was designed by R. H. Carpenter and carved by Earp. In the centre is the Crucifixion, and on the sides are gabled niches with figures of the four Doctors of the Church. At the east end of the south aisle is a chapel with a reredos designed by Charles Spooner for the Guild of Handicraft in 1898, containing a painting of Christ administering Holy Communion by Frank Smallpeice. Also in the south aisle, and again of 1898, are a copper cross and candlesticks by Bainbridge Reynolds in Arts and Crafts style. Much of the stained glass in the church is by Clayton and Bell. This includes the east window of 1876, which depicts the Te Deum. This window was a memorial to Thomas Rowley, headmaster of Bridgnorth Grammar School. Other glass by Clayton and Bell is in the windows in the south aisle of 1874 depicting saints, in the tower of 1873 showing subjects relating to baptism, and in the north aisle of between 1879 and 1908 depicting historical figures of the Church of England. In the chancel, a window of 1873 in the north wall of 1873 is by William Done and shows the Good Samaritan, and in the south wall is a window of about 1847 by William Wailes which represents the Canticles. Also in the church are a number of memorials. In the north wall of the chancel is a monument in Baroque style to Francis Wheeler who died in 1686, and next to it is one to Sarah Wheeler who had died during the previous year. In the south aisle is a brass plaque to William Francis Oldham who died in 1899, and a memorial to Frank Smallpeice who died in 1904. Also in the south aisle are four cast iron ledgers containing dates of death between 1679 and 1707. In the north aisle is a plaque to Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Echaloz Welch (killed in action in France 1918) and in the south aisle a wooden shrine of English oak, surmounted by a representation of the Crucifixion of Christ, by Robert Bridgman and Sons of Lichfield, erected in 1922 as the parish's First World War memorial. There is a ring of eight bells. Five of these were cast in 1681 by Thomas Roberts, and the other three are by John Warner & Sons, two are dated 1874 and the other one is dated 1895.

He was born 1919 in Baltimore, Maryland. His mother, Emma Winston Eareckson, was a registered nurse and head of pediatric nursing in the United States Steel Corporation's villages. His father, Gerald Murray, was an engineer at the United States Steel Corporation. Murray had a brother named Gerard. As a small child, George's parents moved him to Bessemer, Alabama. Later, George attended the University of Alabama. He died at the age of 87 on July 14, 2006, in Fairhope, Alabama. Education George Mosley Murray graduated from the University of Alabama in 1940 with a B.S. degree in business administration. He previously graduated from Hueytown High School.1958 Hueytown High School Retrospect yearbook notes him as a prominent graduate of the school He worked for the General Electric company in Charlotte, North Carolina, until 1942 when he joined the Navy. George served in the military for 4 years of service. He enlisted in the Navy when World War II started. Murray served as an instructor in the Gunnery School for a year before volunteering for seventeen months on the submarine Pintado. He was discharged in 1946. George's term in the Navy only confirmed his desire to become a minister. He wanted to work for the Episcopal Church. So after his discharge in 1946, Murray decided that he wanted to attend the Virginia Theological Seminary in which graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1948. Work After his graduation, he was ordained to the diaconate by Bishop Carpenter of Alabama on April 5, 1948 at Trinity Church, Bessemer, Alabama, and priest a few months later at Christ Church, Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Shortly after, he accepted his first position in the church as the Episcopal student chaplain at the University of Alabama. Five years later, at the age of thirty-four, he was elected the Suffragan bishop of the Alabama Diocese, and after his consecration at the Church of the Advent in Birmingham, became assistant to Bishop Charles Colcock Jones Carpenter. In 1959, his election was virtually assured when he was made Bishop Coadjutor and thus was slated to succeed Bishop Carpenter. And in 1969, he became the Ordinary of the Diocese. But he remained in the post only two years. When the Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast was created from the southern one-third of Alabama and the Florida panhandle, he accepted the call to become its Bishop and left for Mobile, the new see city. His term in Alabama ended on December 31, 1970 and his term in Central Gulf Coast commenced on January 1, 1971. Under his leadership, the new diocese has prospered; by the end of 1971, it numbered fifty-six congregations and more than 12,000 communicants. Awards Bishop Murray received a number of notable honors since he was elevated to the episcopate. In 1953, the year he was made Suffragan Bishop, the University of Alabama gave him its Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award, and the College of Preachers at Washington Cathedral invited him to participate in a special six- week refresher course as a Fellow of the College. A year later, he was made an honorary Doctor of Divinity by the University of the South and his alma mater, Virginia Theological Seminary. In 1956, he was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Alabama. And in 1968, St. Bernard College in Cullman, Alabama, made him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. Personal life Bishop Murray was married to Margaret Macqueen. They resided in Fairhope, Alabama. Murray had three children with his first wife, Elizabeth Malcolm Murray. Their names are George Malcolm Murray, William Gerard Murray, and Sarahy Duncan Murray. He also has three grandchildren: Sean Douglas Murray, Erin Elizabeth Murray, and Andrew Stuart Murray. Legacy George M. Murray was the youngest of the eight Alabama clergymen who wrote \\"A Call For Unity\\". During the Civil Rights Movement Murray and his first wife, Elizabeth Malcolm Murray, decided that they both wanted to be active in the calling for greater equality and human rights. They did, however, get a lot of criticism from all sides. They were criticized for being too involved or not involved enough. While serving as Bishop Coadjutor, Murray was one of eight Birmingham clergymen who co-authored an April 12, 1963, open letter on racial tensions titled \\"A Call for Unity\\". This letter was the impetus for Reverend Martin Luther King to write in his famous \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\".

He was a lifelong friend and supporter of William Blake, and like him was an experimental printmaker. He was also an amateur watercolourist, and one of the earliest members of the Bristol School of artists. He made use of his wide circle of connections to help its other members, in particular assisting and influencing Edward Bird and Francis Danby. Early life Cumberland, whose father was also called George, was born in London in 1754. From 1769-85 he was an insurance clerk with the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation. In 1772 he also attended the Royal Academy Schools and exhibited at the Academy in 1782 and 1783, but failed to be elected an Associate in 1784. He formed a low opinion of the Academy and attacked it in various essays. Along with John Flaxman and Thomas Stothard, Cumberland joined the social circle of William Blake within a year of Blake becoming a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1779. This circle also included the engraver William Sharp. The young Cumberland held radical views; with Stothard and Sharp, he joined the Society for Constitutional Information, becoming a friend of its leader, John Horne Tooke, and attracting the attention of government spies. However, when Cumberland witnessed the Gordon Riots of 1780 at first hand, he reacted with horror. Cumberland was to be a lifelong friend and supporter of Blake. As early as 1780 a contribution by Cumberland to the Morning Chronicle praised Blake's first exhibit at the Academy, the watercolour The Death of Earl Goodwin. Cumberland would often seek to provide clients for Blake, as in 1798 when he tried to persuade Tooke to use Blake as the engraver for a new edition of Tooke's book Diversions of Purleigh. Cumberland shared an interest with Blake in printmaking. In 1784 they both experimented with new methods of printing etched texts. In that year Cumberland printed an account of his \\"New Mode of Printing\\", although it does not seem to have been a practical commercial proposition. In printing his own works Cumberland would come to rely on Blake's technical advice on copperplate and lithography. Italy In 1784 Cumberland received an inheritance providing him with an annual income of £300, enabling him to leave his job. From 1785-90 he travelled in Europe, mainly living in Rome. He also visited Paris and Florence, and in 1786 visited Switzerland with Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough. In 1787 he eloped with Mrs Elizabeth Cooper née Price and took her back to Italy. In Rome he joined a circle of artists which included John Deare, Robert Fagan, Charles Grignion the Younger and Samuel Woodforde. Cumberland studied the works of Raphael and the engravers Marcantonio Raimondi and Giulio Bonasone and formed a collection of prints and objects, in particular a large collection of Bonasone engravings. Publications Hafod (1795) by John Warwick Smith alt=A wooded river valley surrounded by mountains, with a distant grand house and lawns on the far slope After Cumberland's return from Italy in 1790 he first lived near Southampton, where he continued to build his art collection. From 1793-98 he lived in Egham, Surrey. In 1793 he published Poem on the Landscapes of Great Britain and the illustrated poem Lewina, the Maid of Snowdon. In the same year he published Some Anecdotes of the Life of Julio Bonasoni, prefaced by A Plan for the Improvement of the Arts in England, which contained a proposal for the formation of a national gallery. His Italian studies bore further fruit in 1796 when he published Thoughts on Outline, a set of theoretical principles for classical art illustrated with 24 designs by Cumberland on classical subjects. Cumberland etched 16 of the designs and commissioned Blake to etch the other 8, with Blake providing the inscriptions for all 24. Blake also provided Cumberland with advice on the engraving process. Another of Cumberland's friends was Thomas Johnes, who was influenced by Cumberland to become a translator of medieval French chronicles. In 1796 Cumberland produced An Attempt to Describe Hafod, a guide to Johnes's estate of Hafod in Wales. Cumberland commissioned Blake to engrave a map to accompany the guide. In 1798 Cumberland published a utopian novel, The Captive of the Castle of Sennaar. He called his utopia Sophis, setting it in Africa, and gave it classical Greek virtues but without war, slavery or sexual inequality. Fearing that its radicalism would antagonise the authorities, Cumberland withdrew the novel, though not before he had sent a copy to another of his acquaintances, Isaac D'Israeli. Bristol School In 1803 Cumberland moved to Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, and then in 1807 to Bristol where he lived for the rest of his life. He became one of the earliest members of the informal group of artists which has become known as the Bristol School, and one of the first to take part in the group's excursions to sketch the scenery around Bristol. Cumberland's daughter Eliza and probably also his son George Cumberland, Jr. sometimes joined these excursions. His friend Stothard also participated occasionally. Cumberland believed that painting should be directly from nature; he produced small landscape studies which avoided the picturesque. His watercolours were similar in style to those of his friend John Linnell. It was Cumberland's son George, a pupil of Linnell, who introduced Linnell to Blake in 1818. Cumberland became a close friend of Edward Bird, and godfather to his son. He did not have the resources to be Bird's patron, but he would lend Bird items from his art collection to study. In 1814 when Bird asked for help in gaining a royal commission, Cumberland introduced him to Charles Long, who then arranged with the Prince Regent for Bird to conduct royal portrait studies aboard the royal yacht. On Bird's death in 1819 Cumberland successfully petitioned the Royal Academy to provide a pension for Bird's widow. Cumberland helped many of the Bristol artists through recommendations and introductions to his influential friends. In 1820 when Francis Danby exhibited The Upas Tree of Java at the British Institution, Cumberland exerted his influence to promote its favourable reception. In 1822 when Danby, Branwhite and Johnson were about to visit London, Cumberland ensured that Thomas Lawrence, Thomas Stothard and others were alerted. There is evidence from their correspondence that Cumberland often suggested subjects for Danby to paint. It has been suggested that the influence of Blake may also have been transmitted to Danby. Danby's second exhibited painting was Disappointed Love, shown at the Royal Academy in 1821. Its subject is reminiscent of Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience, while the work's neoclassical figure of a girl evokes Cumberland's Thoughts on Outline. A later watercolour, A Scene from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" (1832) is very reminiscent of Blake's illustrations for The Book of Thel. Cumberland had been the recipient from Blake of one of the 16 early copies of The Book of Thel and one of For Children: The Gates of Paradise, only five of which now survive. He also had copies of America a Prophecy, Europe a Prophecy, The Song of Los, Visions of the Daughters of Albion and Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Note by Cumberland recording Blake's death in August 1827. His visiting card made by Blake is attached. Blake died in 1827. The last engraving that Blake made was a visiting card for Cumberland, who had sent the plate to Blake for him to decorate. Blake did so by surrounding Cumberland's name with figures intended to represent the Seasons, including children hoop rolling and flying kites. Final years Cumberland was also a collector of fossils and from 1810 was an honorary member of the Geological Society. In 1826 he published Reliquiae conservatae, a study of some fossil encrinites. In 1827 he published Essay on the Utility of Collecting the Best Works of the Ancient Engravers of the Italian School, which catalogued his collection of prints. He presented his collections to the Royal Academy and the British Museum. Cumberland's wife Elizabeth died on 2 February 1837. He died on 8 August 1848 in Bristol; they were both buried at St George's Church, Brandon Hill. They had two sons, George and Sydney, and three daughters, Lavinia, Aurora and Eliza.

Children's charity Youth Music was the lead partner, with music publisher Faber Music overseeing the national singing resource, including the Song Bank library, while advertising agency AMV, BBDO led a media and PR campaign highlighting the benefits of singing. The Sage Gateshead led the Workforce Development programme, which aimed to build the confidence and expertise of teachers and musicians so they could lead and support children's singing activities. Due to restrictions in the programme’s funding, AMV, BBDO stepped away from their role within the Consortium in 2011. From January 2009 to March 2011, Sing Up was championed by the composer and broadcaster Howard Goodall in his role as National Singing Ambassador. In 2010 Sing Up won the RPS Award and in 2013 the programme was praised in the National Plan for Music Education. A research study conducted in 2013 by the Institute of Education concluded that singers engaged with Sing Up are 18 months to 2 years further advanced in their singing competency than those in non- Sing Up music. Research has also shown that singing has a benefit in language development, learning retention, motor skills and music development. Since 2009 Sing Up have worked with over 86,000 singers, 98% of English Primary Schools and SEN Schools and PRU (pupil referral units) with over 8,000 music practitioners. The website holds over 2,000 resources. Over 1,730 schools have achieved a Sing Up Award: 831 Silver, 565 Gold and 134 Platinum. Over 57,000 people have taken part in Sing Up training and professional development.http://www.singup.org/about-us/achievements/ In April 2012, Sing Up became a not-for-profit organisation offering a membership scheme designed for schools, freelance music teachers and organisations, available internationally from 2016. In 2017 Sing Up was shortlisted in the category of Best Digital/Technological Resource in the Music Teacher Awards for Excellence. In 2018 Sing Up won the Music Teacher Editors Award at the annual Music Teacher Awards for Excellence.https://musiceducation.global/sing-up- wins-editors-award-at-2018-music-teacher-awards-for-excellence/ In 2017, Sing Up launched the Sing Up Foundation, a charity aiming to promote singing as an aid to health and wellbeing. Resources Sing Up's website and resources are aimed at providing teachers and music leaders access to cross-curricular singing resources for use in and out of the classroom. The organisation have launched a membership scheme for schools, individuals and organisations.

The fair marked the centenary of the establishment of the Belgian kingdom in 1830. The Liège exposition was one of two simultaneous fairs: one at Liège focused on industry and science from 1830 to 1930 and one at Antwerp concerned with colonial and maritime themes. The two expositions are the more specialized type of world's fairs which Belgium hosted in addition to its hosting of 6 larger expositions. The official name for the Liège exposition was Exposition internationale de la grande industrie, sciences et applications, art wallon ancien (International Exposition of Large Industry, Sciences and Applications, Art of Old Wallonia\\"). The exposition also served as an incentive to complete flood control work around Liège that had been delayed by the First World War. The Pont-barrage de Monsin was built at this time. Palais de l'Egypte In addition to exhibits on science and technology, the exposition included a retrospective on Walloon art and an amusement park. The exposition took place at two locations. The Parc de Boverie, which had hosted the 1905 exposition was renovated. A military maneuver ground north of town became the residential area of Droixhe. The exhibition was not considered a great success. Attracting six million visitors, the organizers had anticipated ten to twelve million. Attendance was cut by the economy, bad weather and public indifference. The exhibition resulted in a modest fiscal loss for the organizers and the city. Vestiges of the exposition included a new airport and train station, control of the Meuse, the commencement of the Albert Canal and the Pont de Coronmeuse, as well as reconstruction of places damaged during the war.

He is the founder of Calyx Internet Access, an Internet and hosted service provider founded in 1995, and of the non-profit Calyx Institute. He was the first person to file a constitutional challenge against the National Security Letters statute in the USA PATRIOT Act and consequently the first person to have a National Security Letter gag order completely lifted. Education and early career Challenging the National Security Letter: Doe v. Ashcroft  After receiving a National Security Letter (NSL) from the FBI, he sued the FBI and Department of Justice and became the plaintiff in the lawsuit Doe v. Ashcroft (filed April 9, 2004 in the United States) filed on behalf of a formerly unknown ISP owner by the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union against the U.S. federal government. The letter—on FBI letterhead—requested that Merrill provide 16 categories of \\"electronic communication transactional records,\\" including e-mail address, account number and billing information. Most of the other categories remain redacted by the FBI. Merrill never complied with the FBI's National Security Letter request, and eventually—several years into the lawsuit—the FBI decided it no longer wanted the information it had demanded and dropped its demand for records. However, for several years after dropping the demand, the FBI continued to prevent Merrill from publicly speaking about the NSL, or even from being publicly identified as the recipient of the NSL. Because National Security Letters are accompanied by an open-ended, lifelong gag order, Merrill was unable to be identified in court papers as the plaintiff in the case and instead was referred to as \\"John Doe\\". As the years passed and the person who held the office of Attorney General changed, the case was renamed from Doe v. Ashcroft to Doe v. Gonzales, and then to Doe v. Mukasey, and finally Doe v. Holder. In fact, in 2007 the Washington Post made an exception to its policy against anonymous op-eds to publish an editorial by Merrill because of the gag order. The case yielded two significant rulings. The first was a September 2004 district court decision that the national security letter statute was unconstitutional, which prompted Congress to amend the law to allow a recipient to challenge the demand for records and the gag order. The second was a December 2008 appeals court decision that held that parts of the amended gag provisions violated the First Amendment and that, to avoid this, the FBI must prove to a court that disclosure would harm national security in cases where the recipient resists the gag order. On August 10, 2010, after more than 6 years, Nicholas Merrill was partially released from his gag order and allowed to reveal his identity, although he still could not reveal what information the FBI sought from him. This was 3 years after Merrill won The Roger Baldwin 'Medal of Liberty' award from the ACLU, which had to present the award to an empty chair at the time. Merrill subsequently founded the nonprofit Calyx Institute to provide education and research on privacy issues. The advisory board of The Calyx Institute includes many notable people in the fields of telecommunications, cryptography, privacy advocacy and computer security, including but not limited to John Perry Barlow, Laura Poitras, Susan Herman, Bob Barr and Jason Snyder.https://www.calyxinstitute.org/about/advisory_panel The Calyx Institute is a member of the torservers.net network, an organization of nonprofits which specializes in the general establishment of Tor anonymity network exit nodes via workshops and donations. He gave the talk \\"The importance of resisting Excessive Government Surveillance\\" at the annual Chaos Communication Congress 2010 from the German Hacker Group Chaos Computer Club in which he told his story of the past 6 years.His talk at the 27c3 timetable, see also 27c3 recordings, 22/01/2011. On September 14, 2015, 11 years after the initial NSL, a federal district court judge in New York fully lifted the gag order, allowing Merrill to speak freely about the contents of the NSL he received. On November 30, 2015, the unredacted ruling was published in full.

The Nojimazaki Lighthouse was one of eight lighthouses to be built in Meiji period Japan under the provisions of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858, signed by the Bakumatsu period Tokugawa Shogunate. The lighthouse was designed and constructed by French engineer Léonce Verny, and is noteworthy in that it is the second lighthouse to be completed in Japan, after the Kannonzaki Lighthouse on the opposing entrance to Tokyo Bay. As completed, the whitewashed octagonal brick structure stood high, and had a first-order Fresnel lens, with a kerosene light source. The lighthouse was first lit on January 19, 1869. During the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the top eight meters of the structure collapsed. It was rebuilt in concrete, and recommissioned on August 15, 1925. The structure was again damaged in 1945 by bombardment by the United States Navy. It was repaired after the war with a second-order Fresnel lens, and was subsequently electrified. The Nojimazaki Lighthouse is currently open to the public, who may visit a small museum at its base, and climb to the top for a panoramic view over the Pacific Ocean.

It does not cover the Historic Colognian grammar, although similarities exist. Colognian has verbal conjugation and nominal declension. The Colognian declension system marks nouns, pronouns, articles, and adjectives to distinguish gender, case, and number. There are the three grammatical genders called feminine, masculine, and neuter, and a special case most often treated as exceptions of neuter. Like the German declension, the Colognian declension system does not mark grammatical gender for its plural forms; plural can thus be treated similar to another gender in it formalism. Five grammatical cases are distinguished: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative. Genitive has two variants, either of which can also be described as expressions using dative. Number is either singular or plural in declension. The Colognian conjugation system has a few hundred individual types of grammatical conjugations, which mark verbs to distinguish person, number, voice, aspect, tense, mood, modality, etc. Colognian basic verbs are classified as strong, weak, or irregular. Independently, there are composite verbs, which are classified as either separable or inseparable. Colognian also has modal verbs and auxiliary verbs, each forming grammatical classes of their own. There are three persons, 1st person, 2nd person, and 3rd person. Number is either singular or plural in conjugations. Grammatical voice can be active, passive, or reflexive. Colognian has indicative and conjunctive moods, and there are also imperative and energetic mood, inferential and renarrative, none of which is completely developed. The aspects of Colognian conjugation include unitary-episodic, continuous, habitual-enduring, and gnomic. In Colognian, grammatical tense can be present tense, preterite tense or past tense, simple perfect or present perfect, past perfect tense, completed past perfect tense, simple future tense, or perfect future tense.  Case system  Colognian distinguishes the four grammatical cases nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative. The genitive has two variants, both of which are compounds or expressions. Colognian is a nominative–accusative language, more precisely a nominative–accusative–dative language. = Nominative = Nominative is the basic form of nouns, etc. It is used to mark the subject or agent in a clause, the verb of which is in the active voice. It marks the subject or patient in a clause, the verb of which is in the passive voice. = Genitive = The two variants of the genitive are compounds. They both contain declined forms identical to dative, plus additional elements. Genitives can only be used in conjunction with another noun, to which they refer. One genitive form in standard word order requires that noun to precede the genitive compound, while the other genitive form is required to follow the noun it refers to. Genitives express a stronger or weaker kind of possession, ownership, or belonging-to. * Examples:  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' () = Dative = ... = Accusative = The accusative marks the direct object of a transitive verb in a transitive sentence. The accusative is also governed by some prepositions, and by some prepositions in conjunction with specific verb classes, which means that independent of other grammatical contexts, these prepositions make the referenced noun use the accusative form. There is a class of adverbial expressions most often telling a time of an action or the place of a movement employing the accusative case. They always have an equivalent expression using a preposition + accusative. Accusative forms in Colognian grammar are in all instances identical to their corresponding nominative forms. Where needed, potential ambiguities are reduced by prosodic elements of speech, but are extremely rare, since Colognian unlike elsewhere follows a strict subject–predicate–object (SPO) word order for transitive sentences in active and reflexive voices and predicate–subject–object (PSO) for questions. This makes it very distinct from German, where word order is more flexible. Because direct objects cannot occur in the passive voice, the accusative does not occur in passive sentences. * Examples:  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' () = Vocative = It could be argued that Colognian has a vocative, the forms of which is identical to the nominative with the articles stripped off. Most commonly, this case is seen as a part of the nominative. Since wishes can be expressed using vocative + imperative, this case is applicable to almost any noun and noun expression. Also, few specific verbs can require an object to use the vocative case. * Examples:  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  Gender system  There are three grammatical genders in Colognian: masculine, feminine, and neuter gender. Most nouns have fixed gender, but there is a class of nouns that can switch from predominantly neuter to feminine on certain occasions. Colognian shares this phenomenon with a large group of local and vernacular languages almost along the entire river Rhine. Very few nouns have an unclear gender. = Masculine = = Feminine = = Neuter = = Natural gender = Natural gender plays only a small role in Colognian grammar. While male persons or living beings customarily are referred to with the masculine gender, females are generally referred to using the neuter gender, with some exceptions mentioned below. However, if a person or animal is named or nicknamed with a meaningful Colognian noun, which is not uncommon, the noun's gender is used to determine articles accompanying the name, but otherwise the person's natural gender is used. = Neuter-feminine gender switching = = Unclear gender = There are very few Colognian nouns of unclear grammatical gender, which have therefore been used with varying gender. This may apply to neologisms for some time until a certain gender evolves for them.  Number system  = Number in declension = The singular is always used when there is exactly one instance of something or occasionally, depending on the ways such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a \\"one\\" at their end, such as 1,001. The plural is used in all other cases, except with zero. Depending on the context and the noun, the singular or the plural is used with zero; sometimes either can be used, but most often, Colognian speakers choose their wording to avoid expressions of the type \\"zero + noun.\\" ... = Number in conjugation = ... = Number in syntax = = Singular = Singular is always used, when there is exactly one instance of something, or occasionally, depending on the ways, such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a \\"one\\" at their end, such as 1001. = Plural = Plural is used for anything else but zero. = Zero = Depending on context and the noun, singular or plural is used with zero instances. Some nouns allow only one of them, other nouns allow that either can be chosen arbitrarily. Yet the actual choice then usually depends on aesthetic aspects of the sentence. Generally, this has little impact since most often Colognian speakers prefer wordings avoiding expressions ususing zero as a count.  Verbs  ... = Voices = Colognian conjugation has the voices: active and passive. Also, there is the reflexive which combines middle voice and mediopassive.  Active  ...  Passive  ...  Reflexive  The reflexive is used, when agent and patient of an action are identical. It can be seen as a middle voice which is both active and passive at the same time. There are few reflexive verbs that are used reflexively only. Many verbs, when used in their reflexive form, carry a connotation of self- contention, or of emotional profit for the agent/patient, there the aspect of being formally reflexive can also be seen as benefactive. Reflexive can also be mediopassive. Since this is predominantly used in generalized speech, semantics diverge from middle voice. Prosody may help to disambiguate. Grammatical forms are identical, however. ... * Examples of mandatory middle voice reflexive:  ' ()  ' ()  ' () * Examples of optional middle voice reflexive :  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' () * Examples of mediopassive reflexive:  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  ' () * Examples of ambiguous reflexive:  ' ()  ' ()  ' ()  References   Bibliography  * Ferdinand Münch: Grammatik der ripuarisch-fränkischen Mundart.

It means generating substantial new business or additional cash flow from sources sometimes outside established business channels, sometimes by connecting with people in non-traditional or hidden markets, and sometimes by prompting current clients to spend more money. A rainmaker is usually a key figure in the business or organization, not merely a salesperson, but a principal or executive who is usually highly regarded within the enterprise. The origin of the business sense of rainmaker may be an allusion to the Native American practice of dancing to encourage deities to bring forth the rain necessary for crops. In summertime during a drought, for instance, the rainmaker would dance and sing songs on the plains, and the activity was believed by others in the tribe to magically cause clouds to come and bring the life-giving rain. By analogy, a business rainmaker would magically bring new business and clients to a firm or generate more revenue from existing customers and donors, and rain is a metaphor for money.Jeffrey J. Fox. How to Become a Rainmaker. Hyperion (May 17, 2000) An example was the late advertising agency executive Frederick D. Sulcer who was described as a rainmaker after bringing numerous new accounts to every agency he's with. According to one view, the role of the rainmaker is to find a dormant business problem and then create a vision of what life could be like if that problem were solved. The term rainmaking is also applied to political fund-raising; for example, United States president Barack Obama was described as a rainmaker in his effort to raise money for other politicians.

This attack on the dry dock behind enemy lines was an attempt to neutralise the ability of the German battleship Tirpitz to attack Atlantic supply lines to Britain as the dry dock at St. Nazaire was the only dock on the Atlantic coast of occupied France large enough to accommodate the Tirptiz and, as base, would allow the German battleship to attack British shipping supply lines.

He was honoured and treated with much respect by the reigning Ahom kingdom monarch Jayadhwaj Singha who made liberal gifts to the Xatra. An ornate gateway engraved with religious motifs, animals and flowers forms the entrance while inside similar sculptures and paintings with divine overtones adorn the walls of the Namghar and heighten the aesthetic appeal of the sacred precincts where the idol of Mahaprabhu Jadavarai is worshipped. Dakshinpat Xatra is a treasure house of dances contributed by Shri Sankardeva such as the Borgeet, Matiakhara, Jumora, Chali, Noyua, Nande Vringee, Sutradhar, Ozapali, Apsara, Satria Krishna and Dasavater among others while it is also a storehouse of antiques of cultural importance and an advanced centre for the performing arts. Due to constant flooding and erosion in Majuli, a new Xatra had been built in Chatai, Jorhat, but two decades after its completion, the Dakshinpat Xatra has not yet moved to the new location. Filial Piety Rituals Satradhikar and Bhakats Monks known as bhakats live in Xatras under the supervision of a Satradhikar and Dakshinpat Xatra currently has about 90 to 100 celibate (udasin) bhakats. Xatra Satradhikars are elected from other Xatras where marriage is permitted. The chosen young man is brought into the Xatra as a teenager and trained in the Vaishnava religion, philosophy and life. During the period of training the young devotee is called \\"Deka-Adhikar\\", or young pontiff. The Satradhikars have taken great pains and precautions to preserve the relics and manuscripts of the saint Srimanta Sankardeva written on strips of bark from the \\"Sanchi tree\\" (Aquilaria malaccensis) in his own hand in the humid and semi-tropical climate of Assam. Name of present Satradhikar is Sri Sri Nonigopal Dev Goswami Raasleela During Raasleela, several thousand devotees visit the holy Xatra every year with the occasion now observed as one of the National Festivals of Assam. Xatras are socio-religious institutions in the Assam region that belong to the Mahapuruxiya Dharma. The Xatras are not merely religious institutions but play cultural and historical roles in society.

In 2007, the Royal Society of Chemistry Malcolm Campbell Memorial Prize was awarded to researchers for its work on a new anaesthesia drug, sugammadex. It currently employs 250 scientists across a range of disciplines including medicinal chemistry, molecular biology and drug metabolism.

Scientists at the site are responsible for the invention of a succession of successful products, two of which have recently received approval. Organon was acquired by Schering-Plough in 2007, and the site was further expanded with the addition of one of the largest compound management facilities in the industry. Schering-Plough merged with Merck (known as MSD outside of North America) at the end of 2009. Products The site has a long history of research in the area of neuromuscular blockers, which are commonly used during surgery, and was responsible for the identification of rocuronium as well as a number of other drugs. In another major advance the reversal agent sugammadex was the first selective relaxant binding agent (SRBA) for Neuromuscular Block Reversal to be identified, and has recently entered the market in Europe. On the psychiatric front researchers at Newhouse supported the development of mirtazepine, a novel tetracyclic anti-depressant which has become widely prescribed throughout the world. More recently the site was closely involved in supporting the introduction of the anti-psychotic asenapine which has just been launched for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

The play is a three-act drama, which takes place in one cave over three time periods; from the Neolithic period, through medieval to modern day or \\"the very near future\\". In one cave, thousands of years of history are played out. A history marked by conformity and the persecution of anyone who dares to speak out. One family struggles to live their day-to-day lives. Then one day a young girl enters the cave and throws their belief system into question. This unsettling and powerful play, from the author of Gormenghast, is a dark, inquisitive look at the role of the artist in society, the nature of authority and its effect on the human condition. The Cave will be published by Methuen in a Mervyn Peake collection in 2011 to celebrate the centenary of Peake's birth. Plot = Act One = An ice-age family of moon-worshipping cave dwellers fight off the constant threat of wolves at their cave mouth. When they expect the moon to smite them a girl enters their cave instead. First they mistake her for the body of the moon and offer to worship her; then they decide she is a blasphemer, for she challenges the moon to strike her down. The father and younger son attempt to kill her but she is saved at the last minute by the elder son. = Act Two = The second act, set in medieval times, opens with the actors in exactly the same positions as at the end of Act I. The elder son, now named Harry, pushes his younger brother, Miles, to the floor and releases his father from his grip. Harry, who drew on the wall of the cave in act one, is now a master sculptor, at work on a gargoyle for the local cathedral. The girl reveals that she is Mary Gray, a suspected witch from a neighbouring village. Soon a witch-hunter, Tom Carter, enters the cave in search of her. Harry knocks her out and hides her behind the carving. Together they conspire to send Tom off on a false trail, but Miles (with his eye on the reward) slips out and brings Tom back. They hear Harry declaring his love to Mary; a fight ensues and the act ends with Harry killing Tom. = Act Three = In a time when nuclear war is imminent, the cave becomes a bomb- proof shelter. The action takes up where it left off: Harry has just killed an informer, and he struggles to cope with what he has done. Mary now appears to prefer Miles, offering whatever he wants if he will help her hide the body. He asks her to marry him. When their mother enters, they quickly blindfold her, as though for a game, and hide the body. But Harry feels obliged to confess and reveals the corpse in the cocktail cabinet. This breaks down the family ties, and he ends by shooting them all, and himself. Then from the pile of dead bodies Mary rises to pronounce the final words: “O world of strange beliefs innumerable, I cannot die … I cannot die. Death will not have me.” Cast of characters = Father/Charles = The father is a figure of authority in the first two acts. His position in act three and with the presence of Tom Carter is more questionable. He is scared of Mary and is immune to her effects until, perhaps, the very end of act three. = First Son/Harry = Harry is the artist son. He is inspired by and falls in love with Mary. He is her main supporter in the cave. He goes on a long journey of self-discovery in the play as Mary expands his mind and understanding. = Second Son/Miles = Miles seeks to discover things, inventing tools and weapons for the benefit of mankind, believing them to be cleaner than the creations of art because they are devoid of emotion. But he fails to see how they can be misused. = Mother = In Act I, she leads the spiritual life of her family; by Act III she is mourning the loss of her younger self and of all faith. “After all we are not in the Stone Age, are we? There are no wolves at the door. But [cavemen] had something to worship. What have I – to take the place of the spirit?” she asks. = Girl/Mary = Mary embodies the power of the imagination that fires the artist and enables him to create things that have no other use but to move us – but it also leads him to break with social conventions. She is eternal. = Tom Carter = Tom is a witch-hunter in Act II and an informer in Act III. He represents the perverse pleasure of repressive authority, resisting change and individuality.

In the 1820s there was a plot to invade Puerto Rico, declare its independence from Spain, proclaim the Republica Boricua and establish its capital in Mayagüez. This invasion was different from all its precursors since none before had intended to make Puerto Rico an independent nation, and use the Taino name Boricua as the name of the republic. It was also intended more as a mercantile venture than a patriotic endeavor. It was the first time an invasion intended to make the city of Mayagüez the capital of the island. The enterprise was conceived and carefully planned, organized and directed as a for-profit commercial enterprise by general Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein, a Germano-French veteran of the Napoleonic wars and of the Bolivarian wars. Background In 1819, Ducoudray Holstein moved to Curaçao, there he began socializing with wealthy French foreigners living in western Puerto Rico that conducted business with Curaçao. These foreigners resented the restrictions on commerce and sea transportation by the Spanish Authorities on the island as a consequence to the insurgent activities of Simon Bolivar in Venezuela. They courted Ducoudray because of his military experience, with the intention of making him interested in leading an armed movement to invade Puerto Rico to convert the island into a republic. For this thus group of foreigners would give him support in any way possible and they counted on a simultaneous general rebellion organized by them amongst the black slaves of the island. Even though they counted on the help of the slaves, the political program of the República Boricua, inspired on European Republican Ideals, it did not include the emancipation of the slaves. While Ducoudray Holstein was in Curaçao he was visited by numerous men including: A. Mattei (“Matthey”), a businessman of French origin with connections in Puerto Rico, George Curiel a Jewish businessman established beforehand in Saint Thomas who in 1819 would return to his native Curaçao, a sailor whose surname was Bouyet, believed to be Juan Bautista Buyé, a contrabandist of French origin and a collaborator of Roberto Cofresí (a beach in Cabo Rojo bears his name). Ducoudray also socialized with a lawyer from the United States called Baptiste Irvine, and editor for the New York Columbian, who would later be a diplomatic agent of the US in Chile. Irvine maintained contacts in Curaçao with Marcow, one of the Marcovich brothers and immigrant sailors from Ragusa, Yugoslavia, who also resided in Curaçao. On March 1, 1822 Ducoudray moved from Curaçao to Saint Tomas, where he had been before, and on April 6, 1822 he obtained there a passport to Puerto Rico. On April 20, 1822 the Curacayian Francis de Chelo informed the mayor of Aguadilla, don Juan Martínez de Acevedo, about a conspiracy of insurgent corsairs that were organizing in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira, that was composed of three mayor ships and four “flecheras”. Each one of those ships would transport three hundred men for disembarking, furthermore the ones that would be brought in the “flecheras” to take the ports of Ponce and Aguada. Afterward on May 18, 1822 the mayor of Aguadilla informed everything to Coronel don José Navarro, Superior Political Chief, “Intendente General” and Interim Governor of the island. Preparations Ducoudray Holstein's expedition found economic support in Fajardo, Naguabo, Guayama, Mayagüez and Hormigueros, in Puerto Rico, and in Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and New York City. He also found a group of experienced officers, and troops ready in an instant to begin the invasion. The Ducoudray Holstein expedition obtained financial support from influential people through wealthy foreigners in Puerto Rico, and other influential sectors in the United States. The expedition was expensive, but the support he received was plentiful. Included were a number of large well-armed ships, whose owners knew the risk that ran their ships taking part in this bellicose endeavor. The troops were mercenary forces whose officers where French. In the course of these efforts Ducoudray and his family moved to San Tómas in the Danish Virgin Islands. From there Ducoudray traveled to Philadelphia in the United States where he found much support and hired several ships. On August 10, 1822, don Juan Leamy, the Spanish Vice-Consul in Philadelphia, reported that a Frenchman surnamed \\"Wischaur\\" was recruiting 200 men for an expedition. The secret agent in Puerto Rico for the expedition was Peter Dubois, a mulatto, native from Guadeloupe, living in Daguao, a barrio of Naguabo. In Philadelphia, Ducoudray and Irvine, alongside forty other persons leased a brig, the \\"Mary\\", for $20,000 from its owner Thomas Wattson, who knew the purpose of the expedition. The Mary was armed with two cannons. They also leased a Dutch brig, the Eendracht. They acquired numerous rifles, pistols, cartridges, gunpowder and other munitions of war, a cargo of flour and left Philadelphia en route to the Antilles in August 1822. A boat from Baltimore and one from New York will also join them on the high seas. Three neighbors from Fajardo appeared on September 13, 1822 before Don Francisco González de Linares, first Civil Governor of Puerto Rico, to inform him that they had discovered the existence of a revolutionary movement for the independence of the island, this movement had support abroad and had many followers on the island, among whom was a resident Frenchman from Fajardo called don Pedro Dubois; Derzá, a Dutchman from Guayama and José Vicente Roman, a Saint Tomas resident of Puerto Rico since 1811. After June 26, 1821 when an insurgent squadron led by a such Villanueva had appeared in view of the port of Mayagüez intending to seize the port battery and set fire to the city, all of Puerto Rico remained on alert. On that occasion the insurgents were rejected by the neighbors of Mayagüez. The military Department of Western Puerto Rico (which covered from Aguadilla to Guayanilla), the Spanish army had 29 individuals assigned to Mayaguez and Aguadilla forts, but it was obvious that such defenses were completely inadequate. By 1822, in the neighboring Danish island of San Tomas there were heightened rumors of an invasion to Puerto Rico, island in which fields and coasts were being carefully monitored in order to avoid the formation and organization of expeditionary groups that could launch an attack against it. Under instructions, seven hundred citizens of France and Germany, under the orders of the Ducoudray Holstein had departed from Boston, headed to the island of San Tomas with nine schooners to form an expedition against Puerto Rico. The Ducoudray expedition arrived on September 16, 1822, at the Swedish island of San Bartolomé (France gave the island to Sweden in 1784) and there it left the Selina and the Andrew Jackson, vessels which were part of the expedition. Ducoudray wanted to go first to La Guaira in two boats to find Colombian reinforcements, but it was not necessary to bring these. Meanwhile, Simon Bolivar launched his first call for a congress to meet representatives of the Hispanic peoples of the Americas to join efforts and finish his liberating work. On board the Brig Mary, which brought 125 men under his command, Ducoudray Holstein wrote a letter to Mr. Boyé asking him to get the money required from Curiel to recruit one hundred men, indicating that once the boats returned from Mayagüez he would send 300 Daalders to his wife through an agent of the republic, may it be Curiel or anyone else. Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico were well aware of what was happening, because the Governor of San Bartolomé, Johan Norderling, told them two brigantines and a schooner - part of the expedition commanded by Ducoudray Holstein, consisting of eight to nine ships with four hundred to five hundred men, six thousand rifles and large collection of gear to attack Puerto Rico - had arrived from New York and Boston to the island of San Bartolomé, which was a neutral port and a base of operations accessible to all, bound for the Dutch Island of Curaçao. They preferred to wait for the expedition to take shape and for all the involved vessels to meet in the Antilles. Another communication from New York reported Puerto Rican authorities that some local separatists had forwarded the sum of twenty-four thousand pesos to finance the costs of this expedition. Furthermore, all this was then confirmed by reports of don Angel Laborde, Commander of the base of Puerto Cabello in Costa Firme; of the Count of Ligny, Spanish agent in Santómas; don Juan Leamy, Spanish Vice-Consul in Philadelphia; and the Secretary of State in Madrid. Disclosure and arrests in Curacao In the midst of his journey between San Bartolomé island and the port of La Guaira (Venezuela), Ducoudray and Irvine confronted a storm and rough seas which caused failures in two ships and forced them to change their plans. The owners of vessels decided to interrupt his trajectory and enter the port of Curaçao, where they arrived on September 21, 1822. The Brig Eendracht came under the command of Captain Gold, and the Brig, the Mary came under the command of captain Aaron Burns, commissioned by Ducoudray as captain of the Boricua Navy. Ducoudray and Irvine arrived in Curaçao in the company of a manager, five colonels, one hundred officers and many other Frenchmen which would integrate his projected expedition Puerto Rico, and with a good number of young men from the United States who, as mercenaries, would form part of the same expedition. For the most part these were respectable citizens. Among them was P. Heiliger, probably of the same Heyliger family from the island of San Eustaquio which was very prominent in Santa Cruz and was well established in Hormigueros and the northern coast of Mayagüez. Dutch authorities in Curaçao under pressure from the Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico decided to intervene. The Brig the Eendracht arrived credited by fake Dutch papers as a result Governor Paul R. Cantzlaar, Secretary William Prince, judge Serurier (Daniel Serurier, President of the Curaçao Tribunal of Justice), the Chief Executive Prosecutor Mr. Isaac James Rammelmann Elsevier, proceeded to confiscate the ship. The other brig, the Mary, in different circumstances, since its papers were in order, but it was also loaded in men and arms, was also intervened and put under surveillance by the Dutch authorities. Ducoudray, who had disembarked and was staying in attorney Elsevier house as a guest was arrested on September 23, 1822 and authorities occupied the valuable cargo of weapons that they brought. Also the proclamations and other documents that incorporated the true nature of their business and plans of landing by Añasco, where they would be joined by the men gathered by Peter Dubois in Puerto Rico to then take the city Mayagüez by military force, which was destined to establish the headquarters initially and then the Council of State and the capital city of the Boricua Republic. Disembarking the valuable cargo of Ducoudray expedition ships, Curaçao's Dutch authorities found 6,000 rifles, 500 carbines, 150 pairs of pistols, 12 campaign cannons, 6 campaign gun carriages, 200 mounts, 15 cartridges barrels, 60 barrels of gunpowder and two boxes, one containing printed proclamations prepared in advance to be used as goals of the invasion were being achieved, and which revealed the purpose of the expedition, and the other filled with Cockades of four colors for the clothing of the expeditionary forces. It is likely that other vessels that were part of the expedition and never came to Curaçao were captured by general don Francisco Tomás Morales Spanish field marshal. The Danish Governor of San Tomas; Peter Carl Frederick von Sholten wrote on October 8, 1822 to the Governor and Captain General of Puerto Rico don Miguel de la Torre, who had only a month in Office, offering information about the mulattos Pierre \\"Bidet\\" and Louis or François \\"Pinau\\" and telling him that the projected expedition had been prepared by a Frenchman called \\"Tonet\\", who in the past had been Governor of Guadalupe and was now a well-known agent of then Haitian President Jean Pierre Boyer. Peter Dubois was arrested by the authorities of Puerto Rico which occupied important documents. He was tried for the crime of conspiracy with foreigners, found guilty and executed on October 12, 1822 in the presence of slaves from several ingenios involved in the plot, in Guayama and in the vicinity of Añasco, place chosen by Ducoudray Holstein to carry out the landing of troops because of its lack of fortifications with artillery and its convenient proximity to Mayaguez. Republica Boricua The expedition called for the proclamation of the República Boricua or Boricua Republic in Spanish. The word Boricua came from Boriken, the Taino name for the island of Puerto Rico. One of the documents the plotters prepared beforehand was a \\"Solemn act of the Declaration of Independence\\" there they wrote: “The Spanish government has given us the most forcible proofs of its tyranny, its bad faith, and of its incapacity to protect and to govern us”. In the same document they held the Spanish king responsible for treating: “us a subjects, as slaves; it has been deaf to our just and lawful remonstrances,” and later writing that “Fully impressed with these truths, we declare solemnly before the Almighty God, before the whole Universe, that we are resolved to suffer a similar tyranny no longer. A free, independent, and wise Government will give us happiness, strength, and consistency”. Later on the declaration appoints the general-in- chief of the expedition (Ducoudray-Holstein) as president and provisional civil, political, and military chief until a National Congress could be assembled to discuss the project of a constitution and the installation of legislative, judicial, and executive powers.17 U.S. Congress, 2 Session II, No 540, 1035 Another document of Ducoudray-Holstein comprised orders to the officers of the expedition. It informed them “to cause the inhabitants to forget that you are strangers”. He maintained that the soldiers try to learn Spanish, and to be virtuous by not using foul language, not drinking and not partaking in games of chance. The Republica Boricua was going to give people full citizenship, equality of rights and duties, regardless of “their skin color, their religion, and their birth place.” Foreigners Americans; regardless of color, would make part of this new republic. The new republic was also envisioned of being made up of “thousands of foreigners” that would arrive.Attached to a proclamation by the captain general of Puerto Rico, nd, Affaires Diverses Politiques, Etats Unis, vol 2, dossier 9, Archives des Affaires Etrangères [AAE] (Paris) The new republic would have a constitution. It would give equality to citizens of the new nation including freedom of religion. The new country would open its ports and its custom fees would be low. The republic's organization was also envisioned by the plotters. Each municipal council would send a deputy to the central council. Also political prisoners arrested by the Spanish would be liberated. On the other hand, the slave population of the island would not be freed since that would mean the collapse of the local economy. The government would be a liberal one, and in some time a congress and an improved constitution would be drafted. There would be separation of the three powers. =Mayagüez, capital of the Boricua Republic= Apart from Mayagüez being the cradle and the capital of the Freemasons in Puerto Rico, which was perhaps the best source of support and contacts, general Ducoudray Holstein had many reasons to make the capital of the Republic Boricua, Mayagüez since in the western area of Puerto Rico resided many of their more affluent advocates, it had a significant French population, given that it was the site where many French immigrants who managed to flee the French Saint Domingue were established. Furthermore, the Bay of Mayagüez was the largest and had one of the best ports of the island, the Ensenada of Mayagüez had the largest and fastest-growing population in Puerto Rico. The city lacked fortifications which could impede the invasion, and its port was the most active on the island, which, for being so distant from San Juan, would take longer for the Spanish forces to reach from the capital of San Juan. Trials Ducoudray Holstein and Baptiste Irvine were judged in Curaçao during more than ten months as mercenaries and for disturbing the peace for sailing using false Dutch papers. Ducoudray claimed he had always kept well aware of the nature of his expedition to the Governor of Curaçao, and their damaged vessels had sought an emergency shelter in the neutral port of Curaçao, and that he was entitled to receive an equal treatment as another distinguished traveler in a foreign country, therefore had done nothing that deserved to deprive him of his liberty or his right to receive the hospitality of the place. He indicated that if Curaçao was neutral, there was no cause or reason to stop him nor to seize anything, because his expedition was not aimed against the Netherlands. He also pointed out that his accusers were a gang of bandits and pimps and that everything the Governor and his henchmen were interested in was to enrich themselves unfairly staying with ships, money, load, the accoutrements of war and other spoils of the Ducoudray Holstein expedition, which had cost more than 150,000 Rijksdaalders, excluding the value of the ships, all in clear detriment of prestige in the Netherlands. This gave rise to the most damaging murmurings and was public scandal. The Civil Governor of Puerto Rico, Gonzalez de Linares insistently claimed shipment of Ducoudray - Holstein and other prisoners to Puerto Rico, but Dutch authorities in Curaçao refused to do so. Eventually Ducoudray Holstein and Baptiste Irvine were found guilty, sentenced to death and their possessions were confiscated by the Dutch authorities because of their alleged criminal acts. Ducoudray Holstein expressed that he did not fear for his life, because their executioners would not dare kill him when everyone knew that there was no evidence to justify such a thing. In fact, Leonard Sistare, who was convicted of altering the paper of the brig The Eendracht, had been allowed to leave Curaçao without receiving punishment or suffering any penalty. When Ducoudray Holstein and Irvine appealed to the Superior Court of The Hague in the Netherlands, the appeal was denied. Then they requested a reconsideration of that judgment and this resource was also denied, but discomfort and the public outcry grew in such a way and came to have such a magnitude that the Governor, informed by his spies, instructed the President of the Court to grant the appeal. When everything seemed lost for them, they were granted that third appeal. Then the King of the Netherlands, William I of Orange-Nassau, received the advice of his Council of State and pardoned them, probably due to the influences of Lafayette and the government of the United States, which immediately allowed Ducoudray Holstein to immigrate to their country. The Minister of The Colonies of the Netherlands ordered the Governor of Curaçao to suspend all legal proceedings, which should be annulled and their records destroyed, that the accused be treated according to their ranks and education, released and that their expenses be paid until they reach a place chosen by them.  Aftermath  When deported, Ducoudray Holstein sailed to the United States while Irvine, who was American, decided to move to Caracas, where he remained until 1824, when he moved to Puerto Cabello, the most important stronghold of Venezuela. The President of the United States, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams, the United States Secretary of State, denied any involvement in this matter on the other hand three major U.S. citizens, including Sergeant Major Andrews, a former officer of the Army and Mr. Agnew, an influential landowner and ship owner who provided a good part of the funds for the expedition, and Mr. Baptiste Irvine who was the second in command of the Ducoudray expedition. On April 5, 1824 Ducoudray arrived in New York City with María del Carmen, his wife and his sons decided on settling in the United States. He taught a course on military tactics and altered his own name, using instead of his name, and as first name, the surname Lafayette, perhaps to conform to the American way of using names or to honor his friend whom he owed his life and freedom, because that same year, at the behest of the United States Congress, the Marquis de Lafayette was invited by President James Monroe to visit United States, something that made on July 12, 1824. Lafayette was baptism godfather to the eldest son of Ducoudray, who was called La Fayette in honor of his godfather. The Ducoudray family, with their three children, settled in the village of Seneca, on the outskirts of Albany and near Geneva in the State of New York, and since then the General retired to live the quiet life of a university professor teaching at Geneva College (today Hobart & Smith) in New York and in the Albany Female College. Ducoudray Holstein died in Albany in 1839 and his remains rest in the rural cemetery in the city. His family continued to live there for 25 years until the death of his son Lafayette D. Holstein in 1864. He had reduced the Ducoudray surname to a mere middle initial to have his surname be simply Holstein.

In a career spanning more than two decades, Cowan's films have covered many themes and genres, such as science-fiction and adventure films. He was born in Ghana to an English businessman and an Italian mother. In February 2018, Michael Cowan was disqualified from being a company director for 13 years because of his previous unfortunate association with fraudster Steve Wilkinson. Michael Cowan reported Steve Wilkinson to the police after discovering his fraudulent actions in January 2015. Mr Wilkinson has now disappeared. The court order was made against Mr Cowan after government agency the Insolvency Service launched an investigation into the company 'Warlord' which was set up purely for the purpose of making the Film of the same name; and to which Steve Wilkinson was the sole Producer. Anthony Hannon, official receiver in the Public Interest Unit, said: “Little of the large sums raised from the public were used for the stated purposes, and there has been detriment both to the investing members of the public and to the reputation of investment in the UK film industry. The investigation also found that for almost half of the investors no records were kept by the company of who they were or the amount they had invested. This meant that if the film had actually been made and returned profits, there would have been no record of investors to be able to send money back to. It soon became clear that the company would not be making the film and that it was not in a position to be able to repay the money. Warlord Productions Ltd was formed on 29 January 2013, Companies House had received a complaint in regards to Cowan having his name fraudulently added to several companies without his knowledge. Mr Cowan was unable to attend court when the company was dissolved, however he accepted his disqualification due to his association to Steven Wilkinson. The order means that Cowan is not allowed to act as a director of a company, take part - directly or indirectly - in the promotion, formation or management of a company or limited liability partnership, or to be a receiver of a company’s property for the 13-year period. Mr Cowan is appealing the disqualification period as he is a victim of the fraud.

In the story, set in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, a rich Argentine ranch owner builds a replica of Rick's Café Américain on his estate, with the idea of reproducing in it, by means of doubles, the most important scenes of the movie Casablanca. Plot summary Casablanca begins when the narrator, who is driving his car to Mar del Plata seaside resort, is caught by a big storm. While looking for some shelter he comes across a place similar to Rick's Café Américain. He gets out of the car and, almost blinded by the rain, hurries to the entrance door. Just then somebody starts playing \\"As Time Goes By\\" on a piano at the back of the room. The player is identical to Sam, but much older; he is wearing the same suit jacket that is shown in the film, but worn out now. In one of the corners, an old man in dark glasses, who looks like Humphrey Bogart, is dozing at a table. When the song is over, the black man starts to tell the narrator the story of the place and of the people who lived there. It all started, he says, in the early fifties, when the owner of those lands, a rich man very similar to Sydney Greenstreet —the actor who interpreted señor Ferrari— decides to build a replica of Rick's café to reproduce in it the main scenes of the movie. With this purpose he sends agents around the country and abroad, to look for people whose physical appearance is identical to the characters. He keeps for himself the role of Señor Ferrari. When the cast is ready, they rehearse for some months; their voices and accents must sound like the English spoken in the original version. To imitate the black-and-white movie, everything in the place is in lighter or darker shades of grey. When the café is opened, success is enormous. The people who visit it have the feeling they are “inside” the famous movie. Señor Ferrari's dream (“Ferrari” is the name given to the ranch owner in the story) Señor Ferrari's dream of turning the movie Casablanca into reality has come true. Some years of splendor follow, but an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease and an unexpected flood affect Señor Ferrari's property, and he goes bankrupt. He speaks with President Perón to get a license to play for real money at the roulette wheel and the poker tables (up to that moment people pretended that they were gambling). President Perón —who had visited the place some months before and had an affair with Ilsa (Ferrari's lover) — agrees to it. The café manages to survive, although far from its past magnificence. Then a military coup overthrows Perón, and the casino is closed. It is a hard blow for Ferrari, who commits suicide. In his will, he states that the café will remain the property of his employees, provided that they never shut it down or put it up for sale. In the following weeks, they try to do their best to make ends meet, but after a while some of them give up and desert the place. In a few months, the only ones who remain are Rick, Ilsa, Sam, Renault, and Ugarte. To make a living they decide to perform isolated scenes, which are shown to the few tourists who happen to go by. Time passes, and not only the place deteriorates but the health of its dwellers as well. The moment the narrator arrives, Sam can offer nothing but an account of what happened in that fantastic Casablanca, and introduce Rick and Ilsa, who are much older now (Rick is blind; Ilsa makes a brief appearance, dressed as Ingrid Bergman in one of the scenes of the movie). In a vase placed near the exit door, visitors leave a few coins. Meanwhile, the storm has subsided. Sam plays As time goes by once again, to say goodbye now. The narrator gets into his car and, with the feeling that he has witnessed a sequel to the movie that Hollywood never made, leaves the place. Background In 2002 Edgar Brau was invited by the University of Nevada, Reno as Visiting Professor and Writer-in-Residence for the Fall 2002-Spring 2003. As Writer-in-Residence he had to write a work of fiction during his stay. He had been considering the possibility of writing a fantastic narration (in the line of his The Poem or The Buddha's Eyes) that would be a tribute to his father's movie-theater, where he had spent his childhood years. As he said: “I started Casablanca with the idea of writing a fantastic story that would pay tribute to my father's cinema, where I spent my early years. I wanted that cinema, the building itself, to be very much present in the work. But I soon realized that the narration was leading somewhere else, and as one must never go against the way a story unfolds, I decided to put off that homage for another occasion. Later on I will do it, and with a fantastic story, as I said”. Sidney Greenstreet (left) and Humphrey Bogart (right) So, the novella developed a realistic tone and it had little to do with that cinema of his childhood. It was written in November–December 2002, in Reno, and corrected in February 2003 at Lake Tahoe. Main characters ;Señor Ferrari: A rich Argentine ranch owner, who offers all his possessions to his admired Ingrid Bergman as long as she marries him. His proposal is rejected, so he decides to create his own Casablanca on his estate, and to play the role of Señor Ferrari. ;Sam: He is from Uruguay. He was working as a bellhop at a hotel in the City of Buenos Aires when Señor Ferrari came across him. He's the true narrator in the novella. ;Rick: Argentinean, a former high school literature teacher. He's very fond of French authors and given to drinking. When the novella starts he is over eighty years old and blind. ;Ilsa: Australian. She earned her living as a trapeze artist at an American circus. On a Brazil tour she was hired by one of Señor Ferrari's agents to work as Ingrid Bergman's double. Foul mouthed and energetic, she becomes Ferrari's mistress and protégée. In the story, Sam calls her “Elsa”. ;Ugarte: Before being hired by Señor Ferrari, he sang tangos at a strip-tease night club in the City of Buenos Aires. ;Fortunato: A homeless child adopted by Ilsa and Sam when he was a few months old. In the story he is around ten. Although he does not know the language, he reads French books to Rick. ;The Narrator: Nothing is said about his age, physical appearance or profession. Theme Casablanca Spanish edition The novella Casablanca is a perfect metaphor of Argentina. In the story, the Argentine Casablanca is a copy of the famous movie; in real life, Argentina was built as a copy of certain European countries, a copy, so to say, that “Europeans in exile” (as Borges defined himself and Argentines) made of a movie entitled “Europe”. The splendor of the Argentine Casablanca was weakened, at first, by certain natural disasters, and later on by catastrophical political events; the splendor of Argentina, was eroded mainly by those unfortunate political events. Among them (and as a parallel between real life and fiction which Brau's work reflects perfectly), are the military coups that shook the nation in the period 1930-1980. In the novella, the coup d´état which overthrew President Perón in 1955 was the beginning of the end for Ferrari's fabulous work, for his Casablanca —which had already been “hurt” by the flood and the hoof-and-mouth disease—. In real life, the beginning of the end for that other “Casablanca”, Argentina, took place some years earlier, in 1930 (when José Félix Uriburu led a military coup against President Hipólito Yrigoyen), and the signs of decadence were revealed more slowly. The novella has an open ending. The same thing sometimes happens in real life. Translation into English The translation of Casablanca by Andrea G. Labinger was finalist in 2007 Pen USA Literary Award in the category of Translation.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Clifton-Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches. History The chapel was built in the early 16th century. It was originally the private chapel for Withcote Hall, but later became a parish church. It underwent external restoration and internal refurbishment in 1744, at which time the embattled parapet and the corner pinnacles were added. Architecture Withcote Chapel is constructed in ironstone with limestone dressings, and has lead roofs. The plan is a simple rectangle of four bays, with no differentiation between the nave and the chancel. There are buttresses along the sides and at the corners. An embattled parapet runs along the sides and over the gabled ends. On each corner is a crocketted pinnacle. The windows are all square-headed and contain three round-headed lights. There are doorways on the north and south sides, and signs of a blocked west doorway. Almost all the internal fittings date from the 18th century. The seating is arranged along the sides in the style of a college chapel. The reredos is in Renaissance style, and is in three parts. The centre is flanked by fluted Corinthian columns. The sides are canted with similar columns and with pediments. On top of each side-piece is a marble monument. The stained glass dates from between 1530 and 1540 and has been moved here from elsewhere. It is attributed to Galeon Hone, a glazier who worked for Henry VIII. The windows in the north wall depict the apostles, and those on the south show Old Testament figures including prophets. In the east window, there are depictions of saints and the Crucifixion. Around the chapel are heraldic panels, one including the arms of Jane Seymour.

A tireless defender of racial and religious equality, Saul Solomon was an important member of the movement for responsible government and an opponent of Lord Carnarvon's disastrous Confederation scheme. Early life and background Saul Solomon was born on the island of St Helena on 25 May 1817 (the nephew of the great St Helena businessman Saul Solomon senior). Although his family were St Helenan, they had close links to Cape Town. Saul spent his first few years at a Jewish children's home in England, where he suffered from the malnutrition and rickets that physically affected him for the rest of his life. He then had a rudimentary formal education in South Africa before beginning work as an apprentice in a printing business. He later acquired the business and built it into the largest printing business in the country, founding the Cape Argus newspaper. He was also one of the founders of Old Mutual, today one of the largest insurance firms in South Africa.1820gw – 2.3 Saul Solomon Family, accessdate=2012-12-06 As representative for Cape Town, Solomon entered the very first Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope (Cape Parliament) when it opened in 1854. He remained an MP for this constituency until his retirement in 1883. Political career (1854–1883) Saul Solomon's original election promise had been \\"to give my decided opposition to all legislation tending to introduce distinctions either of class, colour or creed\\".Stanley Trapido, ‘Solomon, Saul (1817–1892)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 17 Nov 2017 Throughout his political career he strictly adhered to this manifesto – repeatedly turning down both cabinet and ministerial posts so as to be free to vote according to his beliefs. He thus assumed a unique role in parliament, being a watchdog critic, as well as sometimes the power behind the government, depending on its policies. Although he was from a Jewish background and even funded the establishment of the Cape's first synagogue in 1849, Solomon was openly secular in outlook, declaring himself to be \\"a liberal in politics and a voluntary in religion\\". In the first Cape parliament in 1854, he presented his \\"Voluntary bill\\" (intended to end government subsidies to churches, and to ensure equal treatment of all beliefs) but it was turned down. He proceeded to put it to parliament every year, only for it to be repeatedly rejected, until it was finally passed under the Molteno government in 1875. =The Responsible Government Movement (1854–1872)= Cetshwayo, the Beaufort lion John Molteno (Cape Prime Minister), and John X Merriman (shown as a monkey). Solomon joined the movement for responsible government in the Cape and helped to institute it when it was established in 1872. The leader of the responsible government movement, Prime Minister John Charles Molteno, was an old friend and a great admirer of Saul Solomon's politics. The two men were both businessmen from poor immigrant backgrounds, who had outlooks that were relatively liberal for the times, and saw eye-to- eye on a number of issues. In fact, according to Saul Solomon's official biography, Molteno only accepted the office of Prime Minister after insisting that it first be offered to Solomon, who turned it down however due to his delicate health.Solomon, W. E. C: Saul Solomon – the Member for Cape Town. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.R.W. Murray: South African Reminiscences. Cape Town:JC Juta & Co. 1894. p.79 Solomon went on to give his powerful support to the Molteno Ministry on many occasions in the future, though he characteristically refused all offers of cabinet positions so as to be able to oppose the government if and when his conscience required it.Mr Thompson, MLA for Grahamstown, summed up the situation that \\"...Molteno would not hold a Ministry together for one week if Mr Solomon was in it; and no cabinet could do without him (Solomon).\\" The Zingari. 9 June 1871, p.94. Reporting on parliamentary session on 7 June 1871. Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. . p.129, \\"The Story of Saul Solomon\\" =Eastern Cape Separatist League (1854–1874)= The eastern part of the Cape Colony had a long-running separatist movement, consisting of a portion of white settlers (the \\"Easterners\\"), led by parliamentarian John Paterson of Port Elizabeth, who resented the rule of the Cape Town parliament and wanted stricter labour laws to encourage the Xhosa to leave their lands and work on the settlers’ plantations.Wilmot, A. The History of our own Times in South Africa, Volume 1. J.C. Juta & co., 1899. p.142 & p.227 In accordance with his stated policy that \\"natives should be allowed to sell their labour as they desired, and that no semblance of coercion should be employed to provide labour for the farmer\\" and because he detested the Easterners' white supremacist views, Solomon took a strong stance against the separatist movement and for a united, multi-racial Cape. Famously, when he was addressing parliament about the need to enforce the principles of racial equality that the Cape's constitution called for, the Separatist representatives all stood up and walked out on him. After a second's pause, he reportedly declared: \\"I would rather address empty benches than empty minds!\\" In parliament he went on to lead the \\"Westerners\\", who backed the Molteno–Merriman government in successfully crushing the separatist league. Separatist parliamentarians branded him a \\"negrophile\\" – an intended insult that he in fact accepted with considerable pride, and he went on to push even further for social reform (for example repealing the discriminatory Contagious Diseases act). =The imposition of Confederation (1874–1878)= Starting in 1874, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Carnarvon, having federated Canada, began an ill-fated plan to impose the same system of confederation on the very different states of southern Africa.Illustrated History of South Africa p.182 \\"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun\\" (1992) The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, The Cape Colony in 1878, on the eve of the Confederation wars Although earlier in his career Solomon had been in favour of a form of federated \\"United States of Southern Africa\\", he shared with the Cape government concerns about the form and timing of Carnarvon's confederation project. Of particular concern to many liberal politicians were the repressive \\"native policies\\" of Natal and the Boer republics (which would have affected the rights of many Cape citizens). Saul Solomon joined the Cape government in arguing that the Cape's multi-racial constitution might not survive a session of bargaining with the Boer republics. Another issue was the fact that some neighbouring states, such as Zululand and the Transvaal Republic, would actually require military invasion to be incorporated into the confederation. Consequently, Solomon ended up vigorously opposing Carnarvon's proposal and the \\"new and impatient imperialism\\" which motivated it.MacMillan, Mona (1969). Sir Henry Barkly, mediator and moderator, 1815–1898. Balkema: Cape Town. p.259. As an alternative, Solomon proposed a looser system of federation, whereby the Cape could preserve its multi-racial franchise. Another proposed alternative was the \\"Molteno Plan\\" of the Cape Government, which advocated complete union instead of confederation, but with the Cape's constitution (including the multi-racial franchise) extended and imposed on the other states of southern Africa. Both suggestions were ignored by the British Colonial Office and over the next few years Carnarvon's disastrous confederation scheme unravelled as predicted, leaving a swath of destructive wars across southern Africa.P. A. Molteno (1900) The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape, Smith, Elder & Co., London =The Sprigg Government (1878–1881)= To further the Confederation scheme, the British Governor had appointed a new and more compliant government, under the puppet Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg. Against the backdrop of the wider \\"Confederation wars\\" that now swept southern Africa, Sprigg began to institute a more discriminatory policy towards the Cape's Black African citizens, and this led to revolts and further conflicts like the Basuto Gun War. Although Saul Solomon had initially agreed to accept Sprigg's new government, its discriminatory policies immediately brought down his strongest criticism, which was voiced through his various media outlets. This culminated in his public campaign against the government for its role in the Koegas atrocities. Sprigg's retaliation was swift. He ordered a review and cancellation of all government contracts with the Argus and other businesses that were linked to Saul Solomon. These were all given to political allies (though without the equipment to fulfill them and at several times the price). Meanwhile, Sprigg's Attorney-General, Upington, launched a series of high- profile lawsuits (bordering on show trials) against Solomon himself. The \\"Pro Bono Publico\\" trial (1878–79) Solomon's editor, the brilliant but contrarian Patrick McLoughlin, had supposedly anonymously written several pieces criticising the Sprigg government and the British colonial establishment, the most infamous of which was entitled \\"Pro Bono Publico\\" (\\"For the Public Good\\"). A series of libel lawsuits were launched by the Sprigg government, ultimately targeting Solomon, whom it tried to link the pamphlets too. Although it was never proven that McLoughlin even authored the pamphlets in question (and Solomon believed he had not), the trial and related pressures caused McLoughlin to resign (he shot himself a few years later). The Sprigg party failed however, to bring Solomon himself down. The \\"Fiat Justitia\\" trial (1879–80) The following year, Solomon's enemies had another opportunity. The Argus printed reports of racism and miscarriage of justice regarding the earlier trials for the Koegas murders, which had been sent to it signed \\"Fiat Justitia\\" (\\"May there be justice\\"). This generated another round of political trials. These attacked Solomon's new editor, Francis Dormer, for libel but again sought ultimately to damage Solomon himself. Once again the editor fell, and once again Solomon survived, in spite of losing the trial. Crucially, he produced letters from the Koegas trial judge asking him to publish the information, and detailing the brutal violence of the murders and the racism which had prevented justice being done. \\"Fiat Justitia\\" ultimately turned out to have been Mr D.P. Faure, who had served as the Koegas court interpreter. Faure was driven from his official career by the Sprigg government, but Solomon later sought out the unemployed Faure and gave him a token translator job with the Argus. Aftermath Solomon emerged from these attacks financially damaged, but largely victorious. The government, frantically cutting back on core infrastructure to avoid bankruptcy from its war expenses, became increasingly unpopular. When its British backers were recalled to London to face charges of misconduct, the Sprigg government fell.P.R. Coates: Cape Colonial Parliamentary Publications, 1854–1910, with special reference to documents in the Dutch language. UNISA. 2009. p. 75. Personal details Physically, Solomon was partially disabled. Childhood poverty and ill health, aggravated by a bout of rickets, had left him with badly stunted legs. When standing, this made him so short that he needed to stand on a chair to be seen when addressing Parliament. His physical condition was particularly drawn attention to by his very high-pitched voice, as well as by the frequent presence by his side of his friend and political ally Molteno, who was unusually tall,Kruger, D. W. (1971) Dictionary of South African Biography p.485, Tafelberg Ltd. . and the image of the two men together was a topic for caricature by the political cartoonists of the time.Van Heyningen, N & Worden, E & Bickford-Smith, V. (1998) Cape Town, the Making of a City p.213, Uitgeverij Verloren Saul Solomon was nonetheless a famously eloquent and persuasive speaker, with an incredibly sharp mind and a skill for reasoned argument. His proposals were usually painstakingly researched and he characteristically spent long hours studying censuses and other government publications for the precise facts and figures that he believed should inform his opinions. Consequently, he was typically always able to back up his opinions with great quantities of evidence as well as with a clear and sophisticated application of logic. This earned him considerable respect, even from his political opponents. W. Darley-Hartley (1934) Reminiscences – South African Experiences Vol.8 An example is the cautious and guarded homage which writer Stanley Little, a political opponent, later paid to Saul Solomon in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leadership. His progressive views on equal rights extended to gender relations (for his marriage ceremony he famously asked that his wife should not have to vow to \\"obey\\" him), religion (he never officially renounced his Judaism, but he abhorred sectarian attitudes and attended churches as often as synagogues) and class (he asked his employees and household servants to simply call him \\"Saul\\"). Marriage, children, and later life Clarensville House in Sea Point In 1873 he met Georgiana Margaret Thomson, the inaugural headteacher of a pioneering girls' school in Cape Colony, now known as Good Hope Seminary High School. Their views tallied on many matters, not least girls' education: he owned a first edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's polemic A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Despite his being almost twice her age, they married. The wedding, which took place on 21 March 1874 at his home, was to have had an alteration to the standard Anglican marriage vows: neither wife nor husband wished her to promise to obey him. However, the two clergymen officiating told the couple that this would render the ceremony without authority, so the words were included. One historian describes their marriage as \\"idyllic\\". The couple had six children. He lived at Clarensville House in Sea Point, Cape Town for most of his life. He and Georgiana enjoyed welcoming guests as varied as Cetewayo, King of the Zulus, and the future British Emperors, Princes Edward and George. In 1881 the eldest daughter drowned - as did the governess who tried to rescue the child.Enthusiams\\"\\" by Mark Girouard, 2011 Solomon's health declined and he withdrew from public life, even handing his business over to his nephews. Saul retired from public life, and the family moved to Bedford in England in 1888, where their sons attended Bedford School. Saul died in 1892, leaving Georgiana with four children to raise.van Heyningen, Elizabeth (May 2006). \\"Solomon, Georgiana Margaret (1844–1933)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He retired from public life completely in 1883 due to poor health and moved to Kilcreggan, Scotland, in 1888. It was here that he died in 1892, of \\"Chronic tubular nephritis\\". Saul Solomon's extended family remained deeply involved in politics and law in southern Africa for many years – though they varied greatly in their political allegiance. In particular, his nephews Sir Richard Solomon and Edward Philip Solomon were very influential at the time of the Boer War and the lead up to the Union of South Africa; their brother William Henry Solomon became the Union's Chief Justice. Solomon's wife Georgiana survived him by over 40 years, and was an influential suffragette. Of their three children who lived to adulthood, Daisy Solomon was also a suffragette, Hon.

During the end of the 1940s Nordic plant physiologists faced difficulties in getting their work published in international journals. Professor M. G. Stålfelt from Stockholms Högskola realized that the plant science community in Scandinavia needed their own organization and journal, so he arranged a meeting in Copenhagen 27–28 October 1947 with representatives from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. It was decided to establish the organization Societas Physiologia Plantarum Scandinavica and that it should arrange regular scientific conferences and publish the journal Physiologia Plantarum from 1948. Professor Hans G. Burström from Lund was appointed editor-in-chief of the journal, a position that he administered for 22 years.

Jindřich Štreit (born 5 September 1946 in Vsetín) is a Czech photographer and pedagogue known for his documentary photography. He concentrates on documenting the rural life and people of Czech villages. He is considered one of the most important exponents of Czech documentary photography.  Biography  Štreit began taking photographs in 1964, during his studies at the Pedagogical Faculty of Palacký University in Olomouc. Following his graduation he worked as a teacher in Rýmařov; later he became director of the school in Sovinec and Jiříkov.Moucha et al. (2006), p. 227 In addition to his profession, Štreit actively participated in public life. As a local chronicler he documented the everyday events and life of Czech villages under the communist regime. The photography theorist Antonín Dufek identified him as \\"a continuer of the tradition of old village teachers, propagators of culture and progress\\".Antonín Dufek, preface to his Vesnice je svět / The Village is a Global World / Das Dorf ist eine globale Welt / Un village, c'est tout un monde (Prague: Arcadia, 1993; ), quoted in: Moucha et al. (2006), p. 227 Sovinec Castle. The photographer is sometimes nicknamed 'Jindra from Sovinec'. In the late 1970s, Štreit's approach to photography began to change. He studied at the Institut výtvarné fotografie (Institute of Art Photography) in Brno, led by K. O. Hrubý and Antonín Hinšt. He graduated from the Institute with a cycle of theatrical photography. At the same time he continued expanding his cycle of everyday life of the villages in the foothills of the Jeseníky Mountains. Additionally, he helped organize cultural life in the region; he participated in organizing exhibitions and concerts. In 1981, during the general elections in the former Czechoslovakia, Štreit documented the official course of the elections. In some of his photographs made during the meetings of the local authorities, the portrait of the President of Czechoslovakia appeared on photographs in very \\"unlikely and absurd places\\". A year later, in June 1982, Štreit agreed to display his works at the exhibition Setkání (The Meeting) organized in Prague by the graphic artist Alena Kučerová. After several hours, the exhibition was banned by the state police and Štreit was arrested and accused of defamation of the President and the country. He was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment with a suspended sentence of two years. As a consequence, he lost his job and was forced to earn a living at a state farm in Rýžoviště. He was banned from taking photographs, but he never respected the ban and returned to photography immediately after his release from the prison. The photography theorist Anna Fárová managed to include his works in the exhibition 9 + 9, visited by Henri Cartier-Bresson, who documented Štreit's installation and published his photos in the French newspaper Le Monde. In 1989, after the Velvet Revolution and subsequent democratization of Czech society, Štreit was rehabilitated and allowed to take photographs without limitations. In 2009, he was named Professor of Applied Arts by the President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus.

A herb mixture is inserted into the patient's nostrils while he lies on his back. The patient then turns over on his stomach while large quantities of mucus are produced from the nose and mouth. The treatment is said to cure sinusitis. The treatment typically involves a gurah practitioner, who inserts the preparation into the nose, with a masseuse also performing massage to relax the patient and relieve pain during the typically two-hour-long procedure.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/07/17/039gurah039-art- cleaning-oneself-inside.html It was developed in 1900 by 'Marzuki' to allow qari, Koran reciters, to speak clearly.http://www.ugm.ac.id/index.php?page=rilis&artikel;=263 Pop singers such as Iwan Fals and government ministers are said to have undergone the treatment.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/18/cleansing-your-way- good-health-with-039gurah039.html The key ingredient is Clerodendron serratum spreng tree, known as 'srigunggu'. Saponin, found in sigunggu, acts as a vasodilator, stimulating mucus production. Tannins are also present in the tree. Gurah has been studied by an ENT specialist from Gadjah Mada University, who said that \\"a patient with sinusitis will feel relief as the mucus can easily flow through the dilated blood vessels after application of the extract\\", noting that the practitioner requires the patient to consume water before and after the treatment, due to the large amount of fluid loss through mucus produced. The study showed that the treatment reduced symptoms such as congestion, sneezing and runny noses of chronic sinusitis. However, full medical testing has not been conducted. Gurah is not recommended for asthmatics or people with heart conditions, and claims of practitioners to remove nicotine from lungs have yet to be tested in a scientific study.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/01/17/traditional- method-039gurah039-a-breath-fresh-air-many.html Some oral gurah preparations are sold, but these are more likely to be dangerous than the traditional treatment localised within the nostrils.

Meera (born 19 February 1970) is an Indian author and journalist, who writes in Malayalam. She was born in Sasthamkotta, Kollam district in Kerala. She worked as a journalist in Malayala Manorama but later resigned to concentrate more on writing. She started writing fiction in 2001 and her first short story collection Ormayude Njarambu was published in 2002. Since then she has published five collections of short stories, two novellas, five novels and two children's books. She won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 2009 for her short-story, Ave Maria.\\"Sahitya Academy awards announced\\" Her novel Aarachaar (2012) is widely regarded as one of the best literary works produced in Malayalam language.\\"ആരാച്ചാര്‍ മലയാളത്തിലെ ഏറ്റവും നല്ല നോവലുകളിലൊന്ന് : ഡോ. എം ലീലാവതി\\" . DC Books. 3 February 2014. Retrieved 23 March 2014. It received several awards including the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award (2013), Odakkuzhal Award (2013), Vayalar Award (2014) and Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award (2015). It was also shortlisted for the 2016 DSC Prize for South Asian Literature. Biography  Meera was born in Sasthamkotta, Kollam district in Kerala as the daughter of Ramachandran Pillai and Amritakumari, both professors. She completed her predegree from D.B College, Sasthamcotta. She passed her master's degree in Communicative English from Gandhigram Rural Institute, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu. Meera lives in Kottayam with her husband M.S. Dileep, who is a journalist with Malayala Manorama. Their only daughter Shruti was a residential student at the Rishi Valley School, Andhra Pradesh. Journalism  In 1993, she joined as a journalist in Kottayam-based Malayalam daily Malayala Manorama, and was the first female journalist to be hired at the newspaper. In 2006, following publication of several stories, Meera gave up journalism to take up writing as a full-time occupation. She was the senior sub-editor of Malayala Manorama when she resigned. During her journalistic career, she published many special stories which won her numerous awards and recognitions. She won the PUCL Human Rights National Award for Journalism in 1998 for an investigative series on the plight of women labourers in Kerala. This series also won the Chowara Parameswaran Award instituted by Kerala Press Academy. A series on children won her the Deepalaya National Journalism Award for Child Rights in 2001.  Writing  Meera's first published work was a story submitted to Mathrubhumi, a magazine, in 2000. Her first short story collection Ormayude Njarambu was published in 2002. This collection won the Gita Hiranyan Endowment Award instituted by Kerala Sahitya Akademi and Ankanam Literary Award. Her next book Mohamanja was published in 2004. It was translated into English by J. Devika as Yellow is the Colour of Longing (Penguin, 2011). The title story, which explores the absurdity of desire, was also published in Arshilata: Women's Fiction from India and Bangladesh (ed. Niaz Zaman). She won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 2008 for the collection Ave Maria. The title story of the book is a brutal glimpse into the debris of Kerala's Communist ideology, the fault lines left behind in families. A translation of this story was included in the book First Proof 5, The Penguin Book of New Writing from India (Penguin, 2010). Her other collections include K. R. Meerayude Kathakal, a collection of major 26 stories published so far, including Machakathe Thachan, Ormayude Njarambu, Mohamanja, Ave Maria, Karineela, Malakhayude Marukukal, Soorpanakha, Alif Laila and Ottapalam Kadakkuvolam. Her early novels include Aa Maratheyum Marannu Marannu Njan, Meera Saadhu, Nethronmeelanam and Yudasinte Suvishesham. Meera Sadhu (DC Books, 2008) tells the story of an IIT graduate abandoned at a Krishna temple after going through some torrid times in her married life. Five of her short novels have been compiled into a single book titled Meerayude Novellakal (2014). Aarachaar, widely regarded as her masterpiece, was originally serialised in Madhyamam Weekly and was published as a book by DC Books in 2012. Set in Bengal, it tells the story of a family of executioners with a long lineage, beginning in the fourth century BC. The protagonist of the novel, Chetna, is a strong and tenacious woman who struggles to inherit this profession. According to noted literary critic M. Leelavathy, Aarachaar is one of the best literary works produced in Malayalam and follows the legacy of O. V. Vijayan's classic work Khasakkinte Itihasam. The novel received the 2013 Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award. It was also awarded the prestigious Odakkuzhal Award in 2013, Vayalar Award in 2014 and Sahitya Akademi Award in 2015. Aarachaar was translated into English by J. Devika as The Hangwoman. The novel has sold more than 38000 copies (as of 2015 January). The novel was translated into English by J. Devika under the title Hangwoman: Everyone Loves a Good Hanging (Hamish Hamilton, 2014). Hangwoman was shortlisted for the prestigious DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2016. Her latest novel Sooryane Aninja Oru Stree is being published in Vanitha magazine. She has also been noted as a screenplay writer of four serials. She was credited as the associate in writing for the film Ore Kadal, a National Award winner. She is also a well- known column-writer in Malayalam.  Themes  Meera cites the work of a number of Indian authors as influencing her work, including E V Krishna Pillai, Kamala Das, T Padmanabhan, S V Venugopan Nair, Anand, M Mukundan, C V Sriraman, O N V Kurup, and Sugathakumari. Amongst non-Indian writers, she cites Gabriel Garcia Marquez as a primary influence. Her work explores themes relating to patriarchy, discrimination, and individuality, focusing on the inner lives of women and challenging traditional power dynamics. Meera has described her work as engaging with her political environment, stating, \\"Every writer is a political writer. It is very difficult for any writer to shut down from what is happening in and around society. And as a writer, we reflect on what’s happening in society through our writing. Writing’s a mixture of conscious and unconscious creative thinking— intuition and craft—it feels very unnatural to analyse it in any other kind of systematic way.”  Awards and honours  * 1998: PUCL Human Rights National Award for Journalism * 1998: Chowara Parameshwaran Award * 2001: Deepalaya National Journalism Award for Child Rights * 2004: Lalithambika Sahitya Award * 2004: Gita Hiranyan Endowment Award by Kerala Sahitya Akademi - Ormayude Njarampu * 2004: Ankanam Literary Award - Ormayude Njarambu * 2006: Kerala Varma Katha Puraskaram - Ormayude Njarambu * 2006: E.

It is a very heavily karstified high plateau, about 60 km² in area, with many caves. The range is located in Austria in the district of Salzburg near Bischofshofen. Some 37 square kilometres of the Tennen plateau are above the 2,000 metre line and that part of the range within the state of Salzburg was turned into a nature reserve in 1982.  Extent and neighbouring ranges  The outline of the Tennen range is formed:Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen * in the west by the Hagen Mountains, a part of the Berchtesgaden Alps, separated by the Salzach river. Here, at the northern end of the Lueg Pass, is the narrowest point of the Salzachöfen Gorge through the Limestone Alps. * in the north and northeast by the River Lammer as far as the Rußbach stream, which descends from the Gschütt Pass. Beyond the Lammer is the Osterhorn Group (Salzkammergut Mountains) * in the east by the Lammer valley as far as Lungötz, separating it from the Dachstein Mountains * in the south it borders on part of the Salzburg Slate Alps right of the Salzach (Hochgründeck, Roßbrand) along the line from Karbach to St. Martin – Fritzbach – Salzach to Bischofshofen = Valley settlements = * Werfen * Pfarrwerfen * Werfenweng * Sankt Martin am Tennengebirge * Annaberg-Lungötz * Abtenau * Scheffau am Tennengebirge * Golling  Summit  View of the karst terrain of the Tennen Mountains looking southeast. In the background: the Hoher Dachstein The highest mountains in the Tennen are Raucheck () in the west and Bleikogel () in the east. The highest points all rise on the southern edge of the plateau, which falls away to the north. The most important peaks are: * Raucheck (2,430 m) * Lehnender Stein (2,402 m) * Pfaffenleitnkopf (2,370 m) * Werfener Hochthron (2,363 m) * Fritzerkogel (2,360 m) * Streitmandl (2,360 m) * Schubbühel (2,334 m) * Tiroler Kogel (2,324 m) * Eiskogel (2,321 m) * Brietkogel (2,316 m) * Wieselstein (2,300 m) * Scheiblingkogel (2,290 m) * Hochkogel (2,283 m) * Fieberhorn (2,278 m) * Tauernkogel (2,247 m) * Knallstein (2,234 m) * Hochkarfelderkopf (2,219 m) * Breitstein (2,161 m) * Tagweide (2,128 m) * Edelweißkogel (2,030 m)  Geology  The Tennen Mountains from the southwest, on the right the hill zone of Werfen-St.-Martin Schuppen Zone The Tennen is a heavily karstified massif, composed mainly of Dachstein limestone lying on a foundation of Ramsau dolomite. Its southern foothills, along the line Lungötz–Werfenweng–Werfen, belong to an imbricate zone (Schuppenzone). This zone, made of Werfen Formation from the Lower Triassic and middle triadic dolomites (Anisian, Ladinian), is called the Werfen-St.-Martin Schuppen Zone.Herbert Weingartner: Die geologischen Situation . In: Erhaltung, Chancen und Weiterentwicklung des Tourismus zur Sicherung einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung in der Region \\"Südliches Tennengebirge\\". Institut für Geographie und angewandte Geoinformatik, Salzburg (as at: 9 October 2000) = Caves = There are numerous caves in the Tennen Mountains.. *The most famous is the Eisriesenwelt near Werfen, which is about 42 km long and is the largest ice cave in the world. Its ice section is open to the public as a show cave. *The best-known caves near valley level are the Brunnecker Cave on Lueg Pass, the Winnerfall Cave near Oberscheffau and the Trickl Cave near Abtenau. These are active water caves which can become flooded during snowmelt or other periods of high water level. *Another important cave system is the Platteneckeis Cave–Berger Cave–Bierloch system in the northwest of the mountain block. This system drains towards the Brunnecker Cave, dropping through a height of over 1,000 metres. *Other important caves are the Schneeloch on the Kuchelbergalm *and the Eiskogel Cave, which crosses the mountain of the same name on the southern edge of the Tennen The Tennen Mountains are a preferred research region for the State Cave Research Association in Salzburg, which collects and publishes results of its research. New caves are continually being found, but even old, well-known caves sometimes reveal new secrets. Knowledge of the caves, and the routes that water takes through them, is important, particularly in terms of future water supply for the population and the protection of water resources.  Walking and climbing  Being a high plateau, the Tennen has numerous trails for the Alpine hiker. However, walkers need to be aware of the lack of water in the karst terrain and the dangers of getting lost in mist or fog. Alpine experience and a good level of fitness are basic pre-requisites, even though there are many mountain huts available. The precipices on the edge of the plateau offer the climber a wide scope of climbing options. The faces on the southern edge of the range, especially around the Werfener Hut and above Dr. Heinrich Hackel Hut are very popular due to their easy accessibility. In winter there are various ski touring routes, mainly crossing the plateau, but also extreme ski routes in some places. = Huts = * Anton Proksch House (1,590 m) * Dr. Friedrich Oedl House (1,575 m) * Dr. Heinrich Hackel Hut (1,530 m) * Edelweißer Hut (2,350 m) * Elmaualm (1,520 m) * Freilassing Hut (1,550 m) * Gsengalm Hut (1,450 m) * Gwechenberg Hut (1,365 m) * Laufen Hut (1,725 m) * Leopold Happisch House (1,925 m) * Mahdegg Alm (1,200 m) * Rossberghütte (1,000 m) * Stefan Schatzl Hut (1,340 m) * Werfen Hut (1,970 m) = Long distance trails = The European long-distance trail E4/North Alpine Way 01/Via Alpina (Violet Trail Stage A34/35) runs through the southern Tennen, from Lungötz to Werfen via the Dr. Heinrich Hackel Hut.

Biography  His father was an ornamental gardener. As a child, he was weak and sickly and worked to strengthen himself through mountain climbing. After showing some talent for sketching, he attended a drawing school and later enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was close friends with the painter, Gustav Jahn, who was also an enthusiastic mountaineer. They went on several expeditions together, some of which were first ascents. The two seemed to be a mismatched pair, as Jahn was always in a good mood, whereas Barth was generally gloomy and dissatisfied with his work. He was a member of the Hagenbund and co-founded an artists' group known as \\"Phalanx\\". He also received several commissions for paintings in public buildings, such as the new wing of the Salzburg Hauptbahnhof and a new hotel in Baden. Although aged only 39, he began to suffer from coronary problems. After some extensive investigation, it was determined that he was probably being poisoned by lead vapors, emanating from the paints in his studio, where he generally slept. He continued to deteriorate and died in 1916. His friend, Jahn, died in a climbing-related accident three years later.

It is located at sea level below Conzelman Road, which leads from the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge up and along the Marin Headlands overlooking the Golden Gate strait that leads into San Francisco Bay. A road behind a locked gate leads to Kirby Cove from just beyond Battery Spencer, the first set of bunkers encountered from Highway 101 at the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge. Description Kirby Cove Camp is located on the north shore of the Golden Gate, in a sheltered cove. It features a small beach with rocky bluffs on either side. A coastal defense site, Battery Kirby, separates the campground from the beach. Much of the cove is forested by non-native eucalyptus, pine, and Monterey cypress. The forest and steep slopes around the cove provide some shelter from the often harsh winds of the Golden Gate. The cove is noted for its isolated feel adjacent to the large, urban setting of San Francisco. =Camping and hiking= Campsite 1 is located on a bluff above the eastern end of Kirby Cove Beach. Campsites 2, 3, and 4 are located away from the water, nestled within groves of trees. To view the Golden Gate, its towering bridge, the City of San Francisco and Land's End, one can walk to the bluff above the beach in front of the batteries and sit at a picnic table. To access the area for hiking or occasional day-use, hikers and campers must hike past the locked gate and go down the mile-long road to the campsites and Battery Kirby. Reservations must be made for Kirby Cove Camp for either overnight camping or day use. Limits are placed on the duration of stay and the amount of yearly use to open this opportunity for as many as possible. =Battery Kirby history= Construction began in 1898 to place a maritime artillery battery in the valley just above a small beach close to the entrance to San Francisco Bay. As the plan was approved and construction began, the defensive battery was named \\"Gravelly Beach Battery\\", using the common name of the truly gravelly beach at the site. The battery was subsequently renamed Battery Kirby in honor of 1st Lieutenant Edmund Kirby, 1st U.S. Artillery. Lt. Kirby headed a Civil War volunteer battalion and was promoted to brigadier general on the day that he died in combat at the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 28, 1863. The name then was extended to first the valley in which the battery was built, subsequently to the present National Park Service campground administrated by the GGNRA. Battery Kirby saw service from 1898 to March 30, 1934, when it was placed in an abandoned status as obsolete. Historical Information: > * Kirby Battery was equipped with two 12-inch shell B.L.R. (breech-loading > rifle) Rifles Model 1895 nos. 12 and 16 * The artillery pieces were > manufactured at the Watervliet Arsenal in Watervliet, New York – near Albany > * Upon de-commissioning of the battery, the guns were sent to Ft. Mills, > Corregidor, Subic Bay, Manila, Philippines in 1933(#12)and 1941(#16) Originally, very few trees grew in the windswept and steep valley at Kirby Cove. Today's present forest was planted over the years as Battery Kirby was developed and occupied. It is dominated by cypress, eucalyptus and pine trees.Kirby Cove Campground Image gallery File:Battery_Kirby_in_coastal_fog.jpgBattery Kirby File:Artillery_Tie- down_at_Battery_Kirby.jpgSteel Tie-down Ring for Artillery File:Cold,_Windy,_Foggy_April_Day_at_Kirby_Cove.jpgPhotographer Shivers File:Kirby_Cove_-_Mano_Seca_Bench.jpgAnother Mano Seca Bench, placed June 2010 File:Mano_Seca_Bench_-_August_2011.jpgMano Seca Bench after a year of exposure File:Pacific_Ocean_flotsam_at_rest_at_Kirby_Cove_Beach.jpgPacific Flotsam resting at Kirby Cove Beach File:Tunnel_for_creek_through_the_Battery_Kirby_embattlement.jpgTunnel draining Kirby Cove canyon creek through Battery Kirby File:Picnic_Tables_on_Kirby_Cove_bluff.jpgPicnic tables on bluff above Kirby Cove Beach File:Container_ship_entering_San_Francisco_Bay_from_the_Pacific_off_Kirby_Cove_Beach.jpg File:Golden_Gate_Bridge_and_San_Francisco_from_Kirby_Cove_bluff.jpgSan Francisco with high marine layer overcast References External links * Kirby Cove Information on the NPS Official Site for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area * Trails and Trailheads of the Marin Headlands * Kirby Cove Information on the web site of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, a non-profit membership organization * Kirby Cove Campground at GGNRA Category:Golden Gate National Recreation Area Category:Closed installations of the United States Army Category:Forts in California ","title":"Kirby Cove Camp"},{"id":"29486071","text":"Percy Wilding Hartley was an English professional football manager who coached Belgian side Standard Liège in the 1920s and 1930s.

The main part of the text forms a dialogue between Vasiṣṭha and Rāma, interchanged with numerous short stories and anecdotes to illustrate the content.Lekh Raj Manjdadria. (2002?)

Mokṣopāya Project: Introduction . expanded and vedanticized, which resulted in the Yogavāsiṣṭha. Philosophy The text of the Mokṣopāya shows that a unique philosophy has been created by the author. It taught a monism ('advaita') that is different from Advaita Vedanta. It makes use of other Darśanas in an inclusive way. The text teaches that the recognition that cognitive objects are non-existent, leads to ultimate detachment, which causes an attitude of \\"dispassion and non-involvement with worldly things and matters\\", though still fulfilling one's daily duties and activities. This liberation is available for everyone, no matter their sex, caste or education, as long as one uses reason and maintains an active life in this world. To reach this liberation, one has to go through three stages: rational thinking and discernment (vicāra), true understanding (jñāna) and detachment (vairāgya). It is only by one's own effort (pauruṣa) that one can be liberated from the bonds of existence. For one who knows the reality, \\"fate\\" (daiva) does not mean anything, something like \\"fate\\" does not exist and has, accordingly, no consequences at all.Slaje, Walter (2000). \\"Wie man sein Schicksal (daiva) meistert.

The History of the Helvetic Confederacy, Volume 2, 2nd ed., John Stockdale, London. p. 282.Loose, Rainer (1976). Siedlungsgenese des oberen Vintschgaus: Schichten und Elemente des Theresianischen Siedlungsgefüges einer südtiroler Passregion, Zentralausschuss für deutsche Landeskunde, Indiana University, p. 233. . () is located in South Tyrol, Italy; it is one of the largest ancient landslides and one of the most remarkable landscape features in the Alps. It is located in the Upper Vinschgau where a broad pass (the Reschen Pass) crosses the main Alpine divide into the Inn Valley (Austria). It extends from Glurns via Laatsch, Schleis, and Burgeis up to Plawenn. On the southern part is the village of Mals. The height difference of the heath varies from 900 m (Glurns) to 1,760 m (Plawenner Alm). The landslide emerges from the small side valley of Plawenntal, and descends for 11 km to the head of Vinschgau proper. The volume of the debris fan is estimated at 1,650 million cubic metres. It had always been assumed to be an alluvial fan, built up by numerous floods and debris small flows. New research demonstrates that a lost mountain could have existed above the head of Plawenntal, with a summit at about 3,100m - the present highest peak on the perimeter being the Mittereck, 2,908 m. There are indications all around the perimeter of a catastrophic collapse, severing former ridges and valley heads (notably Vivanatal). The shape of the lost mountain can readily be reconstructed by projecting these truncated landforms until they meet up. The volume of the lost mountain (named Plawennspitz) is very close to that of Mals Heath. There is at present no evidence of when this event occurred, but probably soon after the last glacier melted, over 10,000 years ago. Similar events probably created large fans nearby at St. Valentin, and in the main Vinschgau, notably at Allitz-Laas (Gadriamure) where the lost mountain and vast debris cone are even larger. Other megafans in the Alps are likely to be catastrophic too (1).Jarman D, Agliardi F, Crosta G (2011): Megafans and outsize fans from catastrophic slope failures in alpine glacial troughs: the Malser Haide and the Val Venosta cluster, Italy. Geological Society Special Publication 351, pp 253-278 The Mals Heath used to be a barren heath since it was so free draining. The debris fan dams a lake, Haidersee, which is now used as a source of irrigation water through a system of channels, and nearly all the heath is now cultivated and prosperous. The fan also displaces the main river, Adige, and the large tributary, Puni, to opposite sides of the valley. Disastrous floods still occur, destroying houses and even villages. The main road climbs the fan in broad zigzags, not the usual hairpins of an alpine pass, with several large wind turbines taking advantage of the smooth terrain and natural wind funnel.

The composer's last major work, it was first performed privately on 24 April 1931 in the chapel at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. Background Commotio was considered by Nielsen to be a particularly important work. In a letter to his son-in-law Emil Telmányi on 24 February 1931 he wrote: \\"None of my other works has demanded such great concentration as this: an attempt to reconstitute what is truly the only valid organ style, the polyphonic music that is especially suited to this instrument, which for a long time has been regarded as a kind of orchestra, which it absolutely is not.\\" Nielsen also commented on the length of the piece: at 22 to 24 minutes, it was longer than any of Bach's organ works.Niels Bo Foltmann, \\"Carl Nielsen: Piano and Organ Works\\", Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 6 November 2010. There was great interest in the piece by Danish organists, resulting in several private performances. In addition to that at the Christiansborg Palace Chapel, there were two performances by Peter Thomsen, two by Finn Viderø on 14 June on the Marcussen organ in St Nikolai's Church, Copenhagen, one a week later by Emilius Bangert in Roskilde Cathedral and yet one more by Peter Thomsen in July. Reception The first public performance was in Aarhus Cathedral on 14 August 1931 where the organist was Emilius Bangert. Despite poor health due to heart problems, Nielsen was present. There do not appear to be any reviews of this performance. After news of the new organ work reached Germany, Erwin Zillinger, an organist from Schleswig, asked Bangert and Nielsen whether Commotio could be played at the Nordic-German Organ Week to be held in Lübeck that October. Nielsen had hoped to be present but weakness resulting from poor health prevented him from travelling. Bangert. who had been selected as the organist, travelled alone to Lübeck where, a day or two later, he heard of Nielsen's death. The concert therefore suddenly became a valedictory performance. The review by Svend-Ove Møller in Dansk Kirkemusiker-Tidende conveyed the emotional experience: “Mixed with the melancholy feelings that fill us on the death of Nielsen, is gratitude that it was granted him to complete this work, which we may designate without exaggeration as the most significant production in recent organ literature. Nielsen understood as few others did how to deploy the resources of his time such that they do not appear modern in the negative sense. His mode of expression, peculiar and distinctive as it may be, feels quite natural; not for an instant does one get the impression that he sought out new paths simply to get away from the well known roads; the affectation which so often characterizes modern music is not to be found in Carl Nielsen; his thoroughly wholesome musical idiom and his ability to create living music has produced here an organ work of enduring value. Emilius Bangert gave Nielsen’s work a masterly performance...\\" Music In connection with the Lübeck performance, Nielsen was invited to provide programme notes. First explaining in a footnote that Commotio meant \\"Movement, also spiritual\\", he continued (translated from Nielsen's German): \\"The Latin word Commotio really applies to all music, but the word is used more specifically here as an expression of self-objectification. In a major work for the mighty instrument that is called the organ, whose sound is determined by the natural element we call air, the composer must attempt to suppress all personal, lyrical feelings. The expression becomes great and rigorous and demands a kind of dryness instead of the emotional, and must rather be gazed at with the ear than embraced by the heart. The work is borne up by two fugues, to which an introduction, intervening movements and coda cling like climbing plants to the tree-trunks of the forest; however, the composer thinks that further analysis is superfluous.\\"  Orchestrations  Two orchestral versions of Commotio werd made in recent years, by Bo Holten, who conducted the Odense Symphony Orchestra himself in 2007,Review in The Gramophone as well as Hans Abrahamsen,Ed. Vilhelm Hansen, 2012.whose version was performed by conductor Fabio Luisi and the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2016.

Its use enables many calculations to be simplified, allowing researchers to get to the core of their problem, while ignoring the effects of queue buildup on a roadway. Vertical queues can also be used in traffic signal analysis, with vertical queues occurring at the location of the stop bar. Concept usage The vertical queue assumption presumes that vehicles on a roadway do not back up over the length of the roadway, which would be considered a horizontal queue, but rather stack up upon one another at the point where congestion begins or at the stop line of a traffic signal. The vertical queue is unitless, and is simply representative of the number of vehicles which are delayed at a given point in a system. This is clearly not possible in real life, but the assumption allows vehicles in an analysis to drive at the free flow speed until reaching the point of congestion. A vehicle does not have to travel at less than the free flow speed due to a road being congested because of a horizontal queue. This simplification is widely accepted by traffic flow theorists. Vehicles enter the vertical queue at the top of the stack and depart from the bottom. The first vehicle to arrive at the point of congestion would thus be at the bottom of the vertical queue. Vehicles incur no delay traveling to the point of congestion, and travel to the point at which the vertical queue occurs without hindrance. The vehicles only incur delay while in congestion or at the stop line. The time vehicles spend within the vertical queue is the difference between the undelayed travel time to the point of congestion and the actual travel time. It is equal to the delay incurred before the point of congestion.

This also changed the usage of the terms for Iranian nationality, and the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from \\"Persian\\" to \\"Iranian\\".

Demographics  There are approximately 63,828 people born in Iran living in Sweden today, as well as 28,600 people born in Sweden with at least one parent born in Iran. They are one of Sweden's largest immigrant groups, accounting for about 1.7% of the population. The very first wave of Iranian refugees consisted of 5,000 Iranian refugees who fled to Sweden in 1979-1980 most of them were middle-aged, middle-class Pahlavi supporters who were opposing the revolution . When the Iran-Iraq War broke out in 1980, almost 20,000 Iranian citizens found asylum in Sweden. Second generation Iranian Swedes are well-represented in higher education and in some well paying professions like dentistry and engineering. About 60% percent of them go on to higher education – more than the Swedish average (45 percent) Iranian culture with its emphasis on education may be part of the reason for this. Becoming an engineer or a doctor is a mantra in many families.

The brightness usually refers the object's absolute magnitude, which, in turn, is its apparent magnitude at a distance of astronomical unit from the Earth and Sun. The phase angle equals the arc subtended by the observer and the sun as measured at the body. The phase curve is useful for characterizing an object's regolith (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the geometrical albedo and the Bond albedo of the body. In ephemeris generation, the phase curve is used in conjunction with the distances from the object to the Sun and the Earth to calculate the apparent magnitude. Mercury Mercury and its opposition surge. The phase curve of Mercury is very steep, which is characteristic of a body on which bare regolith (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° (crescent phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope on the surface of Mercury of about 16°, which is slightly smoother than that of the Moon. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a sharp peak. This surge in brightness is called the opposition effect because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon. Early visual observations contributing to the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller in the 1800s and by André-Louis Danjon in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs, summarized by D. Harris and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the Astronomical Almanac for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now the major source of the phase curve used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes. The apparent brightness of Mercury as seen from Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° (superior conjunction with the Sun) when it can reach magnitude −2.6. At phase angles approaching 180° (inferior conjunction) the planet fades to about magnitude +5 with the exact brightness depending on the phase angle at that particular conjunction. This difference of more than 7 magnitudes corresponds to a change of over a thousand times in apparent brightness. Venus The phase curve of Venus compared to Mercury, and the brightness excess of Venus. The relatively flat phase curve of Venus is characteristic of a cloudy planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, as opposed to the narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply. The history of observation and analysis of the phase curve of Venus is similar to that of Mercury. The best set of modern observations and interpretation was reported by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard. They used the LASCO instrument on SOHO and ground-based, CCD equipment to observe the phase curve from 2 to 179°. As with Mercury, these new data are the major source of the phase curve used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes. In contrast to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus as seen from Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9. Near inferior conjunction the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3 although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus over the course of one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury. Earth The phase curve of the Earth has not been determined as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, earthshine reflected from the portion of the Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the EPOXI spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the phase curve they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at Big Bear Solar Observatory have measured the earthshine and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data. Earth as seen from Venus near opposition from the Sun would be extremely bright at magnitude −6. To an observer outside the Earth's orbit on Mars our planet would appear most luminous near the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun, at about magnitude −1.5. Mars The phase curve of Mars compared to Mercury. Only about 50° of the martian phase curve can be observed from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than our planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude obtained many of the Mars brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama. Because the orbit of Mars is considerably eccentric its brightness at opposition can range from magnitude −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is about magnitude +1.6 when Mars is on the opposite site of the Sun from the Earth. Rotational variations can elevate or suppress the brightness of Mars by 5% and global dust storms can increase its luminosity by 25%. Gas giants The outermost planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are so distant that only small portions of their phase curves near 0° (full phase) can be evaluated from the Earth. That part of the curve is generally fairly flat, like that of Venus, for these cloudy planets. The apparent magnitude of Jupiter ranges from −2.9 to −1.4, Saturn from −0.5 to +1.4, Uranus from +5.3 to +6.0, and Neptune from +7.8 to +8.0. Most of these variations are due to distance. However, the magnitude range for Saturn also depends on its ring system as explained below. The rings of Saturn The phase curve of Saturn, according to Schmude demonstrating the opposition effect of the ring system. The brightness of the Saturn system depends on the orientation of its ring system. The rings contribute more to the overall brightness of the system when they are more inclined to the direction of illumination from the Sun and to the view of the observer. Wide open rings contribute about one magnitude of brightness to the disk alone. The icy particles that compose the rings also produce a strong opposition surge. Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft images have been analyzed in an attempt to characterize the ring particles based on their phase curves. The Moon The phase curve of the Moon compared to Mercury. The phase curve of the Moon approximately resembles that of Mercury due to the similarities of the surfaces and the lack of an atmosphere on either body. Clementine spacecraft data analyzed by J. Hillier, B. Buratti and K. Hill indicate a lunar opposition surge. The Moon's apparent magnitude at full phase is −12.7 while at quarter phase it is 21 percent as bright. Planetary satellites The phase curves of many natural satellites of other planets have been observed and interpreted. The icy moons often exhibit opposition brightness surges. This behavior has been used to model their surfaces. Asteroids The phase curves of many asteroids have also been observed and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way. The effects of rotation can be very large and have to be factored in before the phase curve is computed. An example of such a study is reported by R. Baker and colleagues. Exoplanets Programs for characterizing planets outside of the solar system depend largely on spectroscopy to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama has demonstrated that phase curve analysis may be a useful tool for identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey has pointed out that phase curve anomalies such as the brightness excess of Venus could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to life in the universe. Criticisms on phase curve modelling Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are frequently based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein found no strong evidence that a particular set of Hapke parameters derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.

His forty years long activity included around 100 roles. Sërbo will be particularly remembered for the films Yjet e Neteve te gjata () (1972) and Operacioni Zjarri () (1973), whereas he also played an excellent German Wehrmacht official in the movie Nusja dhe shtetrrethimi () (1978). Sërbo was granted the Merited Artist of Albania award in 1991 and the Nderi i Qarkut () (of the County of Korçë) award in 2009. Sërbo had suffered for a long time from depression and committed suicide on 12 September 2010, following the example of the other well-known Albanian actor, Bekim Fehmiu, who had also killed himself three months earlier. Early life Sërbo was born in 1945 in the city of Korçë, where he finished the elementary and high school. After high school he worked as a painting teacher in the town of Pogradec. After two years of teaching he attended the Academy of Arts in Tirana, where he profitably studied acting in the following four years. Career Sërbo was for the following forty years an actor and director in the Andon Z. Çajupi theatre of Korçë. He also had prominent roles in many movies produced by the Albanian Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re. His first role in theatre was in the Njollat e murrme drama (). He also acted in many Albanian films. His first role in a movie was in Yjet e Neteve te gjata () (1972), where he actually did not pronounce a single word, His first starring role came in the Operacioni Zjarri film () (1973), where Sërbo had the role of Kreshnik Martini, a Sigurimi agent, infiltrated into an anti-communist band operating in northern Albania in 1953, a scenario taken from a real story. After that movie, Sërbo was one of the victims of the 1973 purges of the 11th Plenum of the Communist Party of Albania, which caused him to disappear from any movies for a full four-year period: during this time he played only on theatre roles. Upon his return to cinematography, he continued to excel in all the roles he played. Memorable is the role of the German Wehrmacht official in the Nusja dhe shtetrrethimi film () (1978). Sërbo was considered to be a handsome actor and never passed unobserved in his movies, rather his presence was felt. In addition to his good appearance, he was often said by movie directors to be a perfectionist in his approach to acting. In the Kush vdes në këmbë movie () (1984), dedicated to the figure of 19th century patriot and Albanian language teacher, Petro Nini Luarasi, Sërbo refused to show up at the rehearsals and threatened to leave the cast and travel back to his hometown, because he had not been given the right shoes to play his part, that of Ajaz Gjika, a kachak. Sërbo demanded 19th century shoes so that he could fit perfectly in the character. Sërbo also demanded and obtained an excellent horse to play the movie, rather than the one which he had initially been given, because, according to him, \\"the horse should have a fierce character, similar to that of his master\\". The horse that ended up playing the movie was, in fact, of an excellent breed, because movie director, Vladimir Prifti, in order to please the actor, found a way to \\"recruit\\" the grand-grandchild of Naklon, a horse donated by Joseph Stalin to Albania in the 1950s. The horse had a cost that would today be the equivalent of $2–3 million. In 1986, one year after Enver Hoxha's death, Sërbo moved to Tirana, where he started to work as an assistant director and had the chance to co-direct a number of movies. He also worked as a director in the theater. Sërbo was critical in the last years with the fact that, according to him, there are more actors than premieres. Sërbo was the author of the mise-en-scène of Kostandine and Doruntine and co-scenarist of the theatrical piece with the Albanian well- known writer Ismail Kadare. Sërbo had suffered from chronic depression of which he was under cures. Nevertheless, therapies notwithstanding, he killed himself with his hunting rifle on September 12, 2010 and was found dead in the morning after at his house in Korçë. He was 65 and died a bachelor. He had prior confided to one of his close friends that he wished to have a death similar to that of another famous Albanian actor, Bekim Fehmiu, who had committed suicide three months before Sërbo's death. Besides acting, Sërbo cherished photography as a hobby. He was a participant in the Albanian photography competition Marubi 2003. Sërbo had been awarded the Merited Artist of Albania award in 1991 and the Nderi i Qarkut () award in 2009.

He then took eight, eleven and thirteen passengers aloft the following month.AviaFrance – Profile of the Bleriot XIII The son of a blacksmith, in 1902 he became a graduate Gadz'Art, an engineer of 'Arts and Crafts' of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers (ENSAM) – a prestigious university (grande ecole) specialising in engineering. His aeronautic career included working with Gabriel Voisin, the Seguin brothers, Henri Farman, Ernest Archdeacon and Louis Blériot. He was present when Blériot made the historic first crossing of the English channel in 1909. On 4 October 1910 he was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 249 by the Aéro-Club de France. On 24 May 1911, three weeks before his death, he reportedly surpassed the world speed record although it was never officially recognized. He achieved over the flight between Etampes and Toury in a Blériot using his own enhancements to the Gnome Omega motor. He died in a crash on 18 June 1911 during the Paris–London–Paris leg of Le Circuit Européen (Tour of Europe) air race. He was still within sight of the reportedly 'up to 1 million' spectators at the take-off in Vincennes. Early life Lemartin was born in the commune of Dunes in the Department of Tarn-et- Garonne in south west France. From the moment of his birth he was known as Léon, but his forenames (Théodore, Clovis, Edmond) honoured both his father and both of his grandfathers. When he graduated in 1902 and required authorisations to work he discovered a mistake on his birth certificate, that his family name of 'Le Martin' had been written 'Lemartin', but he decided that it was easier to adopt the 'new' spelling. His father Edmond was a blacksmith and farrier (Fr. Maréchal-ferrant), and a member of the 'Compagnons du Tour de France' (a French community of craftsmen and artisans). He was also the inventor of several 'furnaces maréchal', some of which were patented. Edmond believed strongly in both science and technology so Léon spent many hours working in the forge learning practical skills. Once Lemartin achieved his 'school certificate' he was enrolled at the 'Ecole Pratique' d'Agen'. He was a gifted and serious student who advanced quickly so that in October 1899, when he was just sixteen, he left his native Brulhois area and travelled almost to enroll at the 'Institute of Arts et Métiers' in Aix-en-Provence where he became a Gadz'Art, the nickname given to the students and alumni of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers (ENSAM), a prestigious university (grande ecole) specialising in engineering. At the age of nineteen, in 1902, he became a qualified Gadz'Art, an engineer of 'Arts and Crafts' (Ingénieur des Arts et Métiers) and moved to Paris.Patrimoine (Heritage) – Grandes figures of gadzarts – Profiles of alumni – Léon Lemartin by Jean-Louis Eytier with contributions from Jacques Dalmon, the only grandson of Lemartin.La Marseillaise, Ces « Gadz’Arts » Aixois Entres dans la Legende. 19-07-2010 – Graduates of Ingénieur des Arts et Métiers at Aix-en-Provence In December 1902 Lemartin met aviation enthusiast Louise Soriano, who had divorced the Comte Charles de Lambert and married Ricardo Soriano von Hermansdorff Sholtz, Marquis de Ivanrey. Lemartin and Louise worked together during their joint airship project and subsequently married, upon which he adopted her daughter Jane (or JeanneFrench article -Léon Lemartin) de Lambert from her first marriage. Louise died in December 1907 and is buried in Dunes. Lemartin then married Madeleine, née Baas, and they had three children: Louise, Simone and Léone. Jane de Lambert also grew up in the family. After his death, Madeleine married his brother Albert and had two more children, Maurice and Roger. Airship project Lemartin had an early interest in ballooning and, learning from Alberto Santos-Dumont, he began to build an airship in collaboration with the Spanish aristocrat, financier, engineer, inventor and adventurer Ricardo Soriano von Hermansdorff Sholtz. The project failed due to a fire, so Lemartin applied to the 'L'École Duvignau', but without success. Gnome years Gnome 7 Omega at the Shuttleworth Collection. Brown staining caused by burnt castor oil Gnome 7 Omega on display at the Royal Air Force Museum London In the early 1900s, Lemartin started work at the automobile manufacturer Charron, based in Puteaux Paris. He later moved to E.N.V., and later worked for Gabriel Voisin on the structure of his early experimental glider which was towed into the air from the river Seine, flying , in 1905. Lemartin was apparently not convinced by the Voisin approach and agreed with Louis Bleriot that the engine was key to achieving powered heavier-than-air flight in a monoplane. Thus, he joined Société Des Moteurs Gnome (the Gnome motor company founded by Louis and Laurent Seguin in 1905) where he worked on their 7-cylinder Gnome Omega rotary engine project, and became a key developer of the basic idea. The Omega set a benchmark with its delivery of 50 hp (37 kW) from . He also had a special role in the company whereby he was seconded to directly support the aviators who were using the Omega. At Gnome, he worked with Jules Védrines, another young engineer who went on to win the special consolation prize in the 1911 Daily Mail Round- Britain Air race and the overall prize in the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race.Paris-Madrid Air race – 1911 One of the notable events of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation held at Reims in August 1909 was the public debut of the Gnome rotary engine, and Gnome-engined aircraft won first and third places in the distance prize. Henri Farman's winning flight of () was made with a Gnome engine which had been installed immediately before the flight, his previous engine having proved unreliable. He used the same aircraft to win the passenger carrying prize. Blériot years On 20 August 1910, Lemartin signed a contract to join Louis Bleriot's flying school to train as a pilot and work as an engineer. By this contract, he becomes the first ever official Test Pilot in the world. He qualified six weeks later on 4 October. His registration number was 249, and he was assigned to Bleriot's schools at Étampes and Pau. His contract entitled him to 400 francs per month (about €1,100 in 2006), 30 francs per flight (~€80), and 32,500 francs (~€87,000) to his widow in case of death. On 4 October 1910 he was awarded Aviator's Certificate number 249 by the Aéro-Club de France. On 3 February 1911, at Pau, he broke the world record by carrying seven passengers in a Blériot XIII, surpassing Roger Sommer's previous record of six. During March 1911, he went on to increase the record to eight, then eleven, and finally thirteen passengers, and including the aviators Jeanne Herveu (founder of the first flying school for women.Jeanne Herveux), and Paul Wyss, a Swiss pilot who was training at the Bleriot school in Pau at the time.Pionnair, Les pionniers de l’aéronautique à Genève, Paul Wyss : pilote indépendant des premiers meetings aériens Genevois.. On 24 May 1911, three weeks before his death, he reportedly surpassed the world speed record, although it was never officially authorised. He achieved between Etampes and Toury in a Blériot using \\"his own\\" enhanced model of the Gnome motor. (The official record of was set by Leblanc on 12 June during qualifying for the Gordon Bennett Trophy.) On 1 June 1911, he signed a new contract with Louis Bleriot, becoming a member of the race team to compete at major events and receive one third of any prizes won. The total prize money for the event was 450,000 francsThe Circuit of Europe Flight 25 February 1911 (about €1,200,000 in 2006), made up of a number of separate prizes for the various stages of the race.The Circuit of EuropeFlight 24 June 1911 Death and commemoration Lemartin in 1911 Lemartin died in a crash on 18 June 1911 during the first leg of Le Circuit Européen (Tour of Europe) air race. He was still within sight of the reportedly 'up to 1 million' spectators at the take-off in Vincennes. The Circuit Européen (Tour of Europe) was his first competition. The night before his departure from Vincennes, he was working on the machines of his teammates Gustav Hamel and Lieutenant Jean Louis Conneau (flying under the name André Beaumont) who went on to win both Le Circuit Européen and Paris-Rome. Thus the next morning, 18 June, Lemartin was tired. That morning, the weather was not good and Roland Garros, who was the first to start, had to scratch. He advised Lemartin against flying because \\"les ailes souples ne vont pas tenir!\\" (\\"the wings are too flexible and will not hold\\"), but Lemartin wanted to achieve his dream of racing before a million spectators. According to the New York Times of 19 June 1911: > The wind was rising at the start of the contest, and Le Martin, who was one > of the most experienced aviators in France, rocked about a good deal as his > machine left the ground and swept across the field.

The crowds removed their hats as the wounded aviator was carried > past, or as word passed among the people that he was dead. Le Martin was > alive when he reached the hospital, but expired a few minutes afterwards. Soon after the crash, Madame Bleriot arrived at the site. Ernest Monis, the Prime Minister of France, who was a spectator, sent his doctor, but Lemartin died on arrival at the hospital Saint-Antoine in Vincennes. Coincidentally, two other pilots in the race were killed in separate accidents on the same day. Despite his brief career, Lemartin is considered one of the pioneers of French aviation. He was the 59th aviation pioneer to die.Léon Lemartin, Chef- Pilote de la Maison Blériot by Jacques and Olivier Dalmon, Published 2009, Universud, L’Etoile B1, Marseille Lemartin is buried at Dunes (Tarn-et- Garonne), where both a street and the airport (Piste Théodore Léon Lemartin) bear his name.Piste Théodore Léon Lemartin at Dunes airport His widow Madeleine, who received an insurance allocation of 32,500 francs, continued to raise his three children, Louise, Simone and Léone, plus Jane de Lambert.CDG 1911 Airshow essay Madeleine subsequently married Léon's brother Albert and they had two more children, Maurice and Roger.

The flamenquín is a dish typical of the cuisine of Córdoba (Spain) consisting of slices of jamón serrano wrapped in pieces of pork loin, coated with egg and breadcrumbs and then deep-fried. It is often garnished with French fries and mayonnaise. A common variation replaces the loin with boiled ham. It can also be made with other fillings, such as fish, cheese, or poultry. It was created in the city of Bujalance (Province of Córdoba). It owes its name, which translates literally to \\"little Flemish\\", to the fact that its golden color, deriving from the egg used in the batter, resembled the blond hair of the Flemish assistants who came to Spain accompanying the Emperor Charles V.

First and foremost opson refers to a major division of ancient Greek food: the 'relish' that complements the sitos (σίτος) the staple part of the meal, i.e. wheat or barley. Opson is therefore equivalent to Banchan in Korean cuisine and Okazu in Japanese cuisine. Because it was considered the more pleasurable part of any meal, opson was the subject of some anxiety among ancient Greek moralists, who coined the term opsophagia to describe the vice of those who took too much opson with their sitos. Although any kind of complement to the staple, even salt, could be categorized as opson, the term was also commonly used to refer to the most esteemed kind of relish: fish. Hence a diminutive of opson, opsarion (ὀψάριον), provides the modern Greek word for fish: psari (ψάρι), and the term opsophagos, literally 'opson-eater', is almost always used by classical authors to refer to men who are fanatical about seafood, e.g. Philoxenus of Leucas. Finally, opson can be used to mean a 'prepared dish' (plural opsa). Plato, probably mistakenly, derived the word from the verb ἕψω - 'to boil'. The central focus of Greek personal morality on self-control made opsophagia a matter of concern for moralists and satirists in the classical period. The complicated semantics of the word opson and its derivatives made the word a matter of concern for Atticists during the Second Sophistic.
