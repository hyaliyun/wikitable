Early life and education Galbally was born in 1922, the eighth of nine children of William Galbally and Eileen Cummins, who both came from Gippsland farming families. He was educated at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne. After leaving school at the age of 16, he initially trained to be a priest at Corpus Christi College, Melbourne from 1939 but after the events of Pearl Harbor joined the Navy. While he was in the Navy, Galbally played Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League with Jock McHale's Collingwood. He made just six appearances, all in the 1942 VFL season. A leg injury sustained with an axe while cutting wood left him in hospital for two months and ended his career. He then studied law at the University of Melbourne, where he resided at Newman College. The Frank Galbally Memorial Prize for International Criminal Law at the university is named in his honour. In 1948, he joined his brother John's legal firm. He married Bernadette O'Bryan, daughter of Justice Sir Norman O'Bryan and they had eight children. Career Galbally was one of the first solicitors to practice as a trial advocate without joining the Victorian Bar. He practiced predominately in criminal law, but also appeared in coronial inquests, government inquiries, personal injury and medical negligence matters. He defended his first murder case in 1950 and by the end of his career had achieved an acquittal rate of 80 to 90 per cent. In 1965, Galbally established the law firm of Galbally and O'Bryan with his brother-in-law Peter, a leading personal injury lawyer, after his brother Jack left his firm to pursue a career in state politics. He later served as a member of the Council of the Law Institute of Victoria and the Solicitors' Board of Victoria. He oversaw the preparation of a report commissioned by the Australian Government, which recommended the changing of the policy of assimilation to one of multiculturalism. He was also chairman of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). He was decorated several times by the Italian Government for his services to the Italian community in Australia. Honours Galbally was awarded the honour of Commendatore of the Order of Merit by the Italian Government in 1971. He was created a Commander of the order of the British Empire in 1977 in recognition of his service to the community. Representation During the 1980s, Galbally represented the Painters and Dockers Union in the Costigan Commission and was involved in the appeal to stop the Barlow and Chambers execution. Publications Jury Man, a novel written by Galbally, was made into the 1992 Edward R. Pressman film Storyville. He also wrote a highly popular autobiography, Galbally! published in 1989, which was followed by Galbally for the Defence in 1993.

He is well known for his Gotrek and Felix novels, along with The Blackhearts Trilogy and Jane Carver of Waar. Early history Long has been writing since the age of twelve. Once he broke into the industry, he wrote screenplays for fifteen years. His work resulted in three films and many animated and live-action TV episodes.Nathan Long's IMDB page He lives in Los Angeles, where he writes as well as playing regularly with his band, MI-6. Warhammer Novels =The Blackhearts= Long is responsible for a set of infamous characters in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, the Blackhearts. A gang of renegades and rebels thrown together by unfortunate circumstances, they are given the choice of being hanged for their crimes, or completing secret missions, both highly classified and suicidally dangerous. There have been three novels, published in an omnibus, along with two short stories, one serving as a prologue. =Gotrek and Felix= When William King stepped back from authoring the series to pursue other projects, the ongoing narrative of Gotrek's quest to seek out his doom was, as yet, unfinished. Black Library then approached Long, at the time a newly established, popular author in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, and asked him to continue the series. Since the release of Orcslayer, Long has written four additional novels, along with an audio-book, making it one of the longest- running Black Library runs in the imprint's history, along with Dan Abnett's Gaunt's Ghosts series. Long has been both hailed and criticised for his writing style, which differs substantially from that of King's, who was known for very flowery descriptive text. Long, however, writes with pace and emphasis on the brutal side of the two traveller's lifestyle. Long has also been quoted in an interview as stating that he has \\"... a rough idea ...\\"Interview with Mike Lee and Nathan Long of how Gotrek's eventual death will occur. Audiences may assume this will emerge sooner rather than later, due to the naming format of the books (each a combination of a race or role, and the word \\"slayer\\"), and the limited number of races and roles left to cover. Long was also one of the first few authors to publish an audio-book for the Black Library imprint, titled Slayer of the Storm God. Along with several short stories (mostly exclusive to events held by Games Workshop), these have helped fill out the universe immediately around Gotrek and Felix. His last book in the series, Zombieslayer, was released in September 2010. =Ulrika the Vampire= In addition to his work on Gotrek and Felix, Long also wrote Bloodborn, the first novel in a series surrounding Ulrika, a love interest of Felix Jaeger in the Gotrek and Felix novels, who has become a vampire and is learning to cope with her new form and its wants and needs. Bloodborn was released in June 2010, and was followed by a sequel, Bloodforged, and finally Bloodsworn, the final novel in the trilogy, which was released in 2012. Other work Long has also contributed to Black Library's range of novellas, with a short novel titled Battle for Skull Pass, released in 2008 and available exclusively to Games Workshop customers. The novella was based around the Dwarfs, and their battle to save the township of Karak Grom from greenskin invaders. It was written to accompany the Battle for Skull Pass box set, released by Games Workshop. In March 2012, Night Shade Books published Long's first original book, Jane Carver of Waar. The official blurb from Night Shade Books calls it \\"... a loving tribute and scathing parody of the swashbuckling space fantasies of yore ...,\\" while Publishers Weekly describes it as an \\"... affectionate and often raunchy parody of Edgar Rice Burroughs‚Äôs John Carter of Mars books ...,\\" with a biker heroine in the John Carter role.

Abadan pier, by the Royal Navy during a surprise attack on Iran, August 1941. This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Iran.  Pre-stamp era  In the pre-stamp era an ancient system of couriers operated throughout the Persian empire.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p.230. At a very early stage, these couriers used the ancient route from Babylon to Kermanshah, up to Hamadan‚Äîthe classic Ecbatana‚Äîtouching Tsagros in transit. This royal route changed in the course of time. According to ancient sources like Herodotus and Xenophon, Cyrus, King of Persia paid close attention to the communication network. From Xenophon we learn that Cyrus had stations and stables built to facilitate the couriers' missions and their efficient delivery of messages from the central power to the provinces. It was not a postal service as we know it today and it was not accessible to everyone.  Indian postal agencies  In 1864 British colonial post offices using India's postage stamps were opened in Muscat and Bushire. These two postal outlets proved very successful and in 1867, Anglo-Indian post offices were opened in Bandar Abbas, and Linga. In the course of time a total of 13 Indian Post Offices operated in Iran. Following a 1922 agreement between India and Iran, on 30 March 1923 all Indian postal facilities in Iran were closed, except for two exchange bureaux in Duzdab and Mirjawa that continued to function for a few more years.  Russian post offices  Russian post offices operated in 1908-18 in northern Persia using stamps of Russia.  First stamps  The modern era of postal service in Iran started in 1851 with a postal reform that had no immediate effects. The success of the Anglo-Indian postal operations combined with the positive reports about postal reforms in Europe and throughout the British Empire generated a renewed interest about postal communications and telegraphy in Naser al-Din, the Shah who reigned from 1848 to 1896. In 1865 he sent a delegation to Paris to liaise with the French Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications. The news of the Iranian mission got around and a private businessman by the name of A.M. Riester submitted essays for Iranian stamps featuring a lion and a rising sun behind it, set in an oval inner frame, part of an ornamentally rich frame. Months went by and Riester decided to contact Teheran, but he was chided for taking the liberty of using national symbols for unsolicited stamps. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission had opted for essays featuring a similar design prepared by Albert Barre. These essays caught the attention of top bureaucrats and eventually that of the Shah; as a result, in 1868 imperforate stamps with basically the same design of the Barre essays were printed in Teheran in quantities varying from 3,000 to 8,000 and issued for postal use in four denominations: 1 shahi violet; 2 shais green. 4 shais blue; and 8 shais red. They have been nicknamed the Bagheri stamps, possibly in reference to the person who printed or designed them. There was no hand- stamp or date-stamp in use to cancel these stamps and their circulation and use was relatively modest. In fact, not many letters are recorded, and because of the lack of any cancelling device, it is rather problematic to determine their genuine postal use simply because it is easy to exponentially increase the value of an un-cancelled letter by just adding an adhesive or two on to it.

Facing competition from Ra√∫l Machado, Zeca and Humberto Coelho, he played his first two seasons in the reserve team. On 21 November 1969, Messias made his first appearance for the first team, replacing Coelho in the 53rd minute of a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal.

The aim is to reduce the effort required to set up a data integration system by relying on existing matching and mapping generation techniques, and to improve the system in \\"pay- as-you-go\\" fashion as it is used. Labor-intensive aspects of data integration are postponed until they are absolutely needed. Traditionally, data integration and data exchange systems have aimed to offer many of the purported services of dataspace systems. Dataspaces can be viewed as a next step in the evolution of data integration architectures, but are distinct from current data integration systems in the following way. Data integration systems require semantic integration before any services can be provided. Hence, although there is not a single schema to which all the data conforms and the data resides in a multitude of host systems, the data integration system knows the precise relationships between the terms used in each schema. As a result, significant up-front effort is required in order to set up a data integration system. Dataspaces shift the emphasis to a data co-existence approach providing base functionality over all data sources, regardless of how integrated they are. For example, a DataSpace Support Platform (DSSP) can provide keyword search over all of its data sources, similar to that provided by existing desktop search systems. When more sophisticated operations are required, such as relational-style queries, data mining, or monitoring over certain sources, then additional effort can be applied to more closely integrate those sources in an incremental fashion. Similarly, in terms of traditional database guarantees, initially a dataspace system can only provide weaker guarantees of consistency and durability. As stronger guarantees are desired, more effort can be put into making agreements among the various owners of data sources, and opening up certain interfaces (e.g., for commit protocols). Data graphs play an important role in dataspaces systems. They work on a fact based (triples or \\"data entities\\" made up of subject-predicate- object) ZDNet, Actian adds SPARQL City's graph analytics engine to its arsenal. data modeling approach which supports the \\"pay-as-you-go\\" techniques described above. They support data co-existence and are therefore an ideal technique for semantic integration. Search and relational-style queries and analytics can work simultaneously on data graphs which is another important property of dataspaces.  Applications of dataspaces =Personal information management= The goal of personal information management is to offer easy access and manipulation of all of the information on a person's desktop, with possible extension to mobile devices, personal information on the Web, or even all the information accessed during a person's lifetime. Recent desktop search tools are an important first step for PIM, but are limited to keyword queries. Our desktops typically contain some structured data (e.g., spreadsheets) and there are important associations between disparate items on the desktop. Hence, the next step for PIM is to allow the user to search the desktop in more meaningful ways. For example, \\"find the list of juniors who took my database course last quarter,\\" or \\"compute the aggregate balance of my bank accounts.\\" We would also like to search by association, e.g., \\"find the email that John sent me the day I came back from Hawaii,\\" or \\"retrieve the experiment files associated with my SIGMOD paper this year.\\" Finally, we would like to query about sources, e.g., \\"find all the papers where I acknowledged a particular grant,\\" \\"find all the experiments run by a particular student,\\" or \\"find all spreadsheets that have a variance column.\\" The principles of dataspaces in play in this example are that # a PIM tool must enable accessing all the information on the desktop, and not just an explicitly or implicitly chosen subset, and # while PIM often involves integrating data from multiple sources, we cannot assume users will invest the time to integrate. Instead, most of the time the system will have to provide best-effort results, and tighter integrations will be created only in cases where the benefits will clearly outweigh the investment. =Scientific data management= Consider a scientific research group working on environmental observation and forecasting, such as the CORIE System1. They may be monitoring a coastal ecosystem through weather stations, shore- and buoy-mounted sensors and remote imagery. In addition they could be running atmospheric and fluid- dynamics models that simulate past, current and near future conditions. The computations may require importing data and model outputs from other groups, such as river flows and ocean circulation forecasts. The observations and simulations are the inputs to programs that generate a wide range of data products, for use within the group and by others: comparison plots between observed and simulated data, images of surface-temperature distributions, animations of salt-water intrusion into an estuary. Such a group can easily amass millions of data products in just a few years. While it may be that for each file, someone in the group knows where it is and what it means, no one person may know the entire holdings nor what every file means. People accessing this data, particularly from outside the group, would like to search a master inventory that had basic file attributes, such as time period covered, geographic region, height or depth, physical variable (salinity, temperature, wind speed), kind of data product (graph, isoline plot, animation), forecast or hindcast, and so forth. Once data products of interest are located, understanding the lineage is paramount in being able to analyze and compare products: What code version was used? Which finite element grid? How long was the simulation time step? Which atmospheric dataset was used as input? Groups will need to federate with other groups to create scientific dataspaces of regional or national scope. They will need to easily export their data in standard scientific formats, and at granularities (sub-file or multiple file) that don't necessarily correspond to the partitions they use to store the data. Users of the federated dataspace may want to see collections of data that cut across the groups in the federation, such as all observations and data products related to water velocity, or all data related to a certain stretch of coastline for the past two months. Such collections may require local copies or additional indices for fast search. This scenario illustrates several dataspace requirements, including # a dataspace-wide catalog, # support for data lineage and # creating collections and indexes over entities that span more than one participating source.

Hindwings grey.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description Adults are on wing from May to August. The larvae feed on Betula nana, Betula pendula and Betula pubescens. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a slender corridor. The first part is strongly contorted. The leaf tissue that is cut off is killed, resulting in a brown spot. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.

Threatening the President of the United States is a felony under , punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment, that is investigated by the United States Secret Service. Threatening other officials is a Class D or C felony, usually carrying maximum penalties of 5 or 10 years under , and other statutes, that is investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When national boundaries are transcended by such a threat, it is considered a terrorist threat. When a threat is made against a judge, it can be considered obstruction of justice. Threatening federal officials' family members is also a federal crime; in enacting the law, the Committee on the Judiciary stated that \\"Clearly it is a proper Federal function to respond to terrorists and other criminals who seek to influence the making of Federal policies and interfere with the administration of justice by attacking close relatives of those entrusted with these tasks.\\" There are three elements of the offense of making an illegal threat: (i) there must be a transmission in interstate commerce; (ii) there must be a communication containing the threat; (iii) and the threat must be a threat to injure the person of another. Threats can also sometimes be punished under the statutes criminalizing assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain United States Government officers or employees or assassinating, kidnapping, and assaulting government officials of the United States. United States Sentencing Guidelines take a number of factors into consideration in determining the recommended penalty, including evidence of the person's intent to carry out the threat; disruption to the government function; and the possibility of inciting others to violence. There is also a 6-level official victim enhancement, which makes the recommended penalty, per the sentencing table, approximately double that which would apply if an ordinary citizen were the victim. There can be many motives for making threats, including political motives or a desire to frame someone else for making the threat. The person's intent can greatly affect the sentence. In determining what constitutes a true threat, the courts hold that what must be proved is that a reasonable recipient of the communication would consider it a threat under the circumstances. Thus, a statement to a judge that \\"You and your family are going to die\\" would be regarded as a true threat, even if the defendant claimed that he meant it as a literal, biological truth. If a threat is made to multiple individuals, it may be considered to be outside of the guidelines heartland, and therefore to warrant an enhancement. Incidents =President= The Secret Service prefers not to publicize incidents of Presidential assassination threats, because it believes that it will generate more criminal behavior, especially among the mentally ill. Reports have circulated in the British press that Barack Obama received four times as many threats as his predecessor, a claim that Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan denies. Historically, prosecutions for Presidential assassination threats have risen during periods of national crisis, such as the World Wars and the Vietnam War era.Comment, Threatening the President: Protected Dissenter or Potential Assassin, 57 Geo. L.J. 553 (1969) New communication technologies such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter have become vectors for investigated alleged threats against the President. After the 2016 Presidential election mashable.com reported 12,000 calls for President Donald Trump's assassination in Twitter. =Legislators= There have been comparatively few physical assaults on Members of Congress. On May 22, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner was savagely beaten down to the floor of the Senate chamber with a gold-knobbed cane by Representative Preston Brooks after Sumner delivered a fiery oration against slavery. In 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire on the House chamber, wounding five Members of Congress. In 1978, Representative Leo Ryan was shot and killed in Jonestown, Guyana, becoming the only member of Congress to lose his life in the line of duty. Representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot and severely injured on January 2011 outside a supermarket where she met with constituents. Representative Steve Scalise was gravely wounded in 2017 when he was shot by a former volunteer for Bernie Sanders's 2016 Presidential campaign. Senator Rand Paul suffered several rib fractures and developed pneumonia after a November 2017 attack by a neighbor over a dispute over lawn care. Threats and intimidation directed against Members of Congress are more common than physical assaults. A prominent example was the burning of a cross, an intimidation tactic of the Ku Klux Klan, on House Speaker Sam Rayburn's front lawn in Texas during debate on civil rights legislation in the 1960s. The United States Capital Police investigates threats against Members of Congress and reports to the Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration and/or the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Social media have been used to publish threats and intimidating messages. Threats have been made through YouTube videos and Twitter (which hosted direct threats of violence against Members of Congress such as Representative Bob Goodlatte, and Senators Roy Blunt and John Hoeven). Concern has been voiced in the press over Twitter's failure in some cases to promptly remove threats made against Members of Congress. Kyler Schmitz's threats to shoot Senator Roy Blunt remained on Twitter after Schmitz had been arrested for illegally using interstate communications to make the threat. Christopher Michael McGowan was arrested in April 2018 for a series of Tweets threatening Representative Goodlatte and other lawmakers made from January to April 2018. Twitter's stated policy on \\"Violent threats and glorification of violence\\" says \\"You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people\\". 2010 legislation for health care reform in the United States saw an increased number of threatening communications and actions directed at legislators. Several Members of Congress received threatening messages. Representative Eric Cantor received a threat from Norman Leboon, a donor to Barack Obama who had produced more than 2,000 threatening YouTube videos; the Democratic Party said that it would donate the funds to charity. Other lawmakers' windows were broken with bricks and other objects. House Minority Leader John Boehner stated, \\"Violence and threats are unacceptable. Yes, I know there is anger, but let's take that anger, and go out and register people to vote, go volunteer on a political campaign, and let's do it the right way.\\" Rep. Cantor, who received a bullet through his campaign office window, stated, \\"Security threats against members of Congress are not a partisan issue, and they should never be treated that way. To use such threats as political weapons is reprehensible.\\" He accused Representative Chris Van Hollen of \\"dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon.\\" A spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center remarked, \\"I think it is astounding that we are seeing this wave of vigilantism.\\" After the 2016 Presidential election, personal attacks gained a more prominent place in dialogue between the President and legislators from both major US parties, with at least one Member of Congress advocating harassment of other Federal officials outside of work. In June 2018, Representative Maxine Waters, speaking at an outdoor rally said, \\"If you see anybody from that (Trump) Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" In July 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was confronted with shouted personal insults and the threat \\"we know where you live\\" by a crowd of protesters; earlier, McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao were subjected to verbal abuse by a crowd as they left an event at Georgetown University. According to National Public Radio, at least three Trump administration officials ‚Äî Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump adviser Stephen Miller and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, along with her family ‚Äî have been forced out by vocal protesters from restaurants or denied service. While Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi denounced the tactic of harassing their political enemies. Both Schumer and Pelosi referred to President Trump's personal attacks on political opponents on Twitter while disavowing the tactics of Rep. Maxine Waters. During Senate confirmation hearings on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court, Senator Ted Cruz's Houston campaign office received an envelope containing white powder just after two envelopes containing the poison ricin were mailed to US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and the Chief of Naval Operations. Sen. Cruz and his wife also had to leave their table at a Washington restaurant when protesters shouted them down at their table. According to Newsweek, Senator Susan Collins's office received \\"threatening, profanity-laced phone calls and letters, telling her to vote against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\\". One caller told a young woman working for Collins that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated, according to a voicemail provided to the New York Times by Collins's spokeswoman. Doxing of legislators also occurs. Jackson A. Cosko, a member of Representative Sheila Jackson Lee's staff, was arrested by US Capitol Police in October 2018, charged with public restricted information, unauthorized access of a government computer, burglary, threatening Federal officials and other crimes. According to a Federal arrest warrant filed by Capitol Police, Cosko threatened an aide of Senator Maggie Hassan who found him using a computer in Sen. Hassan's office, then ordered him to leave in an E-mail. Mr. Cosko posted confidential personal information such as home and office addresses and home telephone numbers of five US senators, including Senate Judiciary Committee members Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, to their Wikipedia articles. In April 2019 Cosko pleaded guilty to two counts of Making Public Restricted Personal Information, one count of Computer Fraud, one count of Witness Tampering, and one count of Obstruction of Justice, in exchange for an agreement by the prosecutors to drop other applicable charges. On June 19th, 2019 Cosko was sentenced to 4 years in Federal prison. Cyberstalking of legislators is a related problem. Juan McCullum, a former member of Congressional delegate Stacey Plaskett and Representative Frederica Wilson's staffs was charged in July 2017 with illegally obtaining private nude photographs of Delegate Plaskett and videos of her family from Ms. Plaskett's iPhone while he worked for her, then using an Internet account under an assumed name to distribute the photos and encourage other Internet users to share them online. =Judges and prosecutors= Threats against federal judges can include threats of vigilantism. For instance, in 2004, gun-rights activist, Denver businessman and former Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate Rick Stanley was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for sending two judges, Thornton Municipal Judge Charles J. Rose and 17th Judicial District Judge Donald W. Marshall, Jr., a \\"notice of order\\" demanding that they reverse his conviction for a weapons violation or face arrest by Stanley's Mutual Defense Pact Militia and a trial for treason. Stanley was also ordered to pay $8,250 restitution to police who worked overtime to protect the judges. Threats against federal judges and prosecutors have more than doubled in recent years, with threats against federal prosecutors rising from 116 to 250 from 2003 to 2008, and threats against federal judges climbing from 500 to 1,278 in that same period, prompting hundreds to get 24-hour protection from armed U.S. marshals. The problem has become so pronounced that a threat management center has been opened in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia, where a staff of about 25 marshals and analysts monitor a 24-hour number for reporting threats, use sophisticated mapping software to track those being threatened and tap into a classified database linked to the FBI and CIA. In 2009, a radio host was indicted for, after criticizing three appellate judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit who affirmed a lower court decision to dismiss challenges to Chicago's handgun ban as \\"cunning, ruthless, untrustworthy, disloyal, unpatriotic, deceitful scum\\", allegedly saying, \\"Let me be the first to say this plainly: These judges deserve to be killed.\\" He also allegedly posted blog entries providing a photo and a map of the Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago, where the court is located, with arrows pointing to \\"anti-truck bomb barriers.\\" That case resulted in two hung juries. The sending of white powder as part of a threatening communication has become common since the 2001 anthrax attacks. The making of these threats coincided with high-profile violence against federal officials in that same period, including Baltimore Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Luna, who was stabbed 36 times with his own penknife and drowned in a creek, and Thomas C. Wales, an assistant U.S. attorney in Seattle gunned down at his home. Such incidents lead U.S. officials to take threats seriously. However, actual attacks on government officials are still rare in the U.S. relative to many countries with more unstable governments (e.g. so- called \\"banana republics\\" that frequently experience coups and assassinations) as evidenced by the fact that the most famous judge to be assassinated in recent times was John H. Wood, Jr. back in 1979. Case law records that many threats are made from prisoners dissatisfied with the handling of their own case or fellow inmates', or wanting to serve time in the federal system. Often the penalties for making the threat are more serious than those imposed for the original offense. Threats by inmates are taken seriously if the person has contacts on the outside who are capable of carrying out the threat. Federal officials attribute the rising threat rate to disgruntled defendants, terrorism and gang cases that bring more violent offenders into federal courts, frustration over the economic crisis and the rise of the \\"sovereign citizen\\" movement - a loose collection of tax protesters, white supremacists and others who don't respect federal authority. Social media has become notable in threats against high-profile Federal judges. Several threats or encouragements of others to kill United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit judge Brett Kavanaugh or members of the Senate who supported confirmation of his appointment to the US Supreme Court were made on Twitter. Twitter formally forbids users to \\"make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people\\". =Other civil servants= The Internal Revenue Service is frequently a target of threats. Examples include the case of U.S. v. Darby, in which the defendant told the IRS he was tired of their bullshit, asked how they would like to have a pipe bomb delivered to their place of employment, and said that he didn't eat his victims like Jeffrey Dahmer but just killed them by blowing them up; David J. D'Addabbo, who sent a petition to IRS workers warning that they would be \\"tried by a jury and your penalty will be sought for it to be death by firing squad\\" and told the arresting agents to \\"watch your back\\"; and John Barker, who perpetrated an anthrax hoax against the IRS. According to the U.S. Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration, threats against the IRS have been rising in recent years, and in 2009 rose from 834 to 1,014 per year, an increase of 21.5% over the prior year. There have been incidents of actual violence against the IRS to take place as well, by people ramming cars into IRS offices, setting them on fire, and taking out hits on IRS employees, although the 2010 Austin plane crash was one of the more high-profile incidents. According to a Cato Institute commentator, \\"this trend is likely to continue until there is a fundamental change in our tax laws and collection methods. People who do not have access to the media and cannot afford expensive tax lawyers sometimes reach such a level of frustration with the IRS that they resort to violent or irrational behavior.\\" There is a special statute, , that protects IRS employees from threats, which according to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual, \\"provides a particularly helpful alternative in cases where there is simply an offer of violence unaccompanied by the potential for imminent use of physical force.\\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm01572.htm Federal law enforcement agencies are often the target of threats. Examples include Jeff Henry Williamson, who threatened to blow up FBI headquarters, CIA headquarters and the Justice Department; and Micha Godfrey, who allegedly emailed medical cannabis websites threats against DEA agents and their families, and a search of whose house subsequently turned up four firearms, a bulletproof vest, and cannabis plants. Government agencies are sometimes the subject of blackmail attempts, as when an informer threatened to falsely accuse the FBI of knowing in advance that the World Trade Center would be bombed and of failing to stop it. Doxing is also used against law enforcement officers. During the controversy over full enforcement of immigration laws in the United States in June 2018, the activist Web site WikiLeaks published the identities of over 9,000 alleged current and former employees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement gleaned from the LinkedIn Web site, with their places of employment and contact information. Enforcement When the FBI receives threats over the Internet, it can use National Security Letters to obtain the real name, street address and Internet logs of the sender, and those who provide the information were forbidden by the PATRIOT Act from revealing the request to anyone, until the Doe v. Ashcroft case overturned that gag rule. According to the federal investigators, political protesters who threaten elected officials or turn violent are easier for law enforcement officials to track due to their vocal and high-profile statements on the internet. For instance, Nigel Coleman posted the address of Rep. Tom Perriello online and invited people to \\"visit\\" the official at his home. The address was actually Perriello's brother Bo. A severed gas line at the home was discovered one day after the address was made public.

Four external payloads (payload facilities) can be operated at the same time. The first Columbus-EPF payload facilities were the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) and Sun Monitoring on the External Payload Facility of Columbus (Solar), which were installed during the STS-122/1E mission during an extravehicular activity (EVA) by crew members. Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space and EXPORT will be delivered to the International Space Station at a later, undetermined date. In addition to structural support, Columbus can supply power and data (command) to the Columbus-EPF payloads and can poll the payloads for housekeeping (health and status) and user data. The power and data interfaces available to the Columbus-EPF payloads are directly connected to the Columbus internal distribution systems. Columbus-EPF payloads and payload facilities are controlled and commanded via Columbus using the same data links and ground segment infrastructure used for internal payloads. Each payload has a facility-responsible centre that can transmit commands and receive telemetry via the Columbus Control Centre. Columbus provides a maximum of 1.25 kW per Columbus-EPF location. Each Columbus-EPF location is connected to two 120-Vdc power feeders, each of which has a maximum allocation of 1.25 kW. Switching between the power feeders is done via the payload power switch box in Columbus and requires the power feeders to be powered down. The maximum on-orbit mass of an external Columbus-EPF payload, including the adapter plate, is 290 kg. The dimensions of a payload should not exceed 864 x 1168 x 1245 mm without the adapter plate. Columbus - External Payload Facility (Columbus-EPF) Facility operations The Columbus External Payload Facility (Columbus-EPF) was transported to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Columbus module on STS-122/1E in February 2008. Columbus-EPF payloads and payload facilities are transported to and from orbit using a carrier supplied by the ISS Program. The payloads and payload facilities are manoeuvred by the robotic manipulators of the ISS to their final operational locations on the Columbus-EPF. Each payload or payload facility has an open view to ram and to starboard, as well as one to either zenith or nadir. The view in the wake direction is reduced by ISS structures. At the end of its operational phase, a payload is transported to the carrier by robotic means and returned to ground for post-mission inspection and analysis and, possibly, refurbishment. Bartolomeo The Bartolomeo platform was robotically removed from SpaceX CRS-20's trunk and installed on the external forward side of Columbus module in April 2020, attached to the trunnions that held Columbus in the payload bay of Space Shuttle Atlantis on its 2008 launch. An EVA for ISS astronauts to connect power and communications cables and to install a new Ka-band antenna is planned for later in 2020. ESA is emphasizing its usefulness for commercial entities, academic institutions, and other lower-budget customers. Airbus spent about ‚Ç¨40 million to develop the Bartolomeo platform, according to DLR, the German space agency. DLR says accommodations on Bartolomeo will be priced from ‚Ç¨300,000 to ‚Ç¨3.5 million per year. Data from attached experiments will be routed to the ground through the space station's telemetry system, then go into cloud storage, where scientists can access the information with a smartphone. Payload owners can also send commands to their experiments through a smartphone. A German-made laser communications terminal will be added to Bartolomeo in 2021, allowing faster data links between experiments and their operators on the ground. Airbus is also partnering with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to solicit ideas for Bartolomeo payloads from around the world. Developing countries in particular are encouraged to participate.

Damodaran. It stars Mohanlal, Jayaram, Chithra, Revathi, Innocent, and M. G. Soman. The soundtrack for the film was composed by M. G. Radhakrishnan and the film score was provided by Johnson. Plot Swami Amritananda (Mohanlal) arrives in Kerala on a mission to bring peace at the state, which is burning with communal riots. Swamiji, who is worshiped and respected all over the world, receives death threats from different corners. Lakshmi IAS (Revathi), the District Collector, is assigned to look after Swamiji's security. She warns Swamiji about the tensed situation and the dangers waiting him outside. The presence of Lakshmi, who had been the lover of Swamiji in his past, brings back old memories to him. Years ago, Swami Amritananda was Shivaprasad, the only son of his mother Saraswathy (Srividya), who had to undergo unpleasant experiences in her home from her own elder brother Sreedharan (Jagannatha Varma) and brother-in law Krishnan Kutty Menon (Janardhanan), a police officer, who was loyal to the government. The Communist party in those days was facing strong restrictions from the government for its anti-state activities. Shivan had always been a headache for his mother, for his rebellious nature. But Lakshmi, Sreedharan's daughter, was in love with him, which was opposed bitterly by Sreedharan and family. Shivan, slowly got involved with the Communist movement and in short time became their political goonda. Shivan gets involved in several petty crimes and thus invites more anger from his uncle Krishnan Kutty Menon. Karthy (Chithra), a lady party worker with strong naxalite leanings develops a strong passion towards Shivan, but he is unaware of it. Vasu (Jayaram), his close friend since childhood, is a fun loving character, who always saves Shivan from several issues. Shekharan (M. G. Soman), the party leader identifies the potential of Shivan and cunningly decides to use it maximum for his own personal benefit. Unaware of the shrewd tactics by Shekharan, Shivan gets involved in several crimes, one after another. One day, Karthy, in order to separate Lakshmi from Shivan, fabricates a story about her relation with him. She succeeds in making Lakshmi believe about her illicit affair with Shivan. Thinking that Shivan was just double dating her, Lakshmi informs police about Shivan's hideout and he is arrested and sentenced for a couple of years. This incident changes Shivan completely. He turns into a hardcore criminal, and develops a hatred towards Lakshmi. In a couple of years, the political scene in the state changes. The Communist Party wins power, and Shivan is released from jail. He is appointed as the secretary of the Temple Devaswom, and Lakshmi is now an IAS officer, who is now holding the post of Devaswom Administrator under Shivan. He tries maximum to belittle her. Shivan, a complete corrupt person, now tries the maximum to loot the temple. The temple staff under Sreekanta Poduval (Narendra Prasad) tries to protest, but ends in vain. Vasu is brought into the temple by Shivan, to create a division among the temple staff. Lakshmi tries to convince Vasu, but he expresses loyalty to Shivan, his close friend, without knowing his corrupt ways or political ambitions. Vasu, with in this time falls for the daughter of Thantri Parameshwaran Namboothiri (Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair), the head priest of the temple. But she avoids him completely. Vasu, a lower caste by birth, has no chance to win her, who is already engaged to Chitran Namboothiri (Manianpilla Raju). Under the instructions of Shekharan, Shivan steals the sacred ornament and during the investigation the Thantri is arrested for the theft. Shivan's motive behind the plan was to regain Krishnan Kutty's house. Upon being confronted by the Thantri's daughter, Vasu withdraws his statement against the Thantri. Due to the embarrassment he faced after release, the Thantri commits suicide. Vasu soon gains a position in the Devaswom Board, and sides with the common people instead of Shivan during the meetings. Upon realizing that he could be a threat, Shekharan cleverly reveals Vasu's real motives in front of everyone to get him kicked out. On the flip side, he is allowed to stay as he repented his mistakes. Following these incidents, Shivan and Vasu's friendship goes through a rough phase. Later, Lakshmi learns that Karthy, who was in jail at that point, had made her believe a false story because of the party's agenda. Upon revealing the truth to Shivan, Vasu goes on to fix his relationship with Shivan. Vasu soon confronts Shekharan and threatens to reveal the truth to the cops; soon after he leaves, some goons under the aegis of Pathrose (Captain Raju), an accomplice of Shekharan, follow him to finish him off. Upon coming to know about the plans, Shivan hurries to save Vasu. After a showdown with some goons, Shivan comes to know that Vasu had been killed by Pathrose before his arrival. After Vasu's death, Shivan attempts to take Shekharan's life; instead, the cops are called and Shivan is arrested. Meanwhile, Shivan's mother Saraswathy passes away thinking that he killed Vasu. After his mother's death, Shivan leaves his home to live a spiritual life in various temples around the country, thus eventually making him a renowned spiritual leader. Back to the present, Shekharan and his accomplices plan to kill Swami Amritananda in an attempt to save their face. The plan is to kill Swami Amritananda during the \\"Ratha-Yatra\\" using a bomb. As soon as Lakshmi comes to know about the plan through Kaiyathan (Kuthiravattam Pappu), a former aide of Shekharan, she does everything in her right to save Swami's life; in the process, she gives her own life to save the Swami. After Lakshmi's death, Swamiji goes back to Shivan's avatar to seek revenge for everything he lost. Finally, he kills Shekharan, Pathrose, Krishnan Kutty Menon, and all their other accomplices.

The art director was Sabu Cyril. The film features sequences in temple set, for that they created a temple similar to the Guruvayur Lord Krishnna Temple in Kozhikode.  Soundtrack  The song \\"Ambalappuzhe\\" is a popular number from the film. It was composed after the lyrics were written. Composition took place at the Woodlands Hotel in Chennai in 1992. Priyadarshan, M. G. Sreekumar, and lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri was also present along with composer Radhakrishnan. They wanted a song relating to temple. Both Priyadarshan and Sreekumar wanted the song to start with the line Ambalappuzha, where Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple is situated. Right after, Kaithapram wrote the first line \\"Ambalappuzhe Unni Kannanodu Nee\\" for which Radhakrishnan prepared a tune, this continued for each line after line. Recording took place at the Kothandapani Studio in Chennai, where Sreekumar and K. S. Chithra sang it together. Musical notations were given at 07:00 AM IST in the morning, recording was finished by 01:00 PM. Instruments such as violin and flute were used. The song features Jayaram in the film.

Bumm Bumm Bole was released on 14 May 2010.Trailer and Preview of Bumm Bumm Bole The title of the film is based on one of the songs of Taare Zameen Par. Plot Khogiram Gwala, Ritu Gwala and their children Pinu and Rimzim. They don't have enough money for uniform or shoes. Things become worse when Pinu misplaces Jhilmil's only pair of shoes in the vegetable shop. Pinu tells jhilmil about the shoes and begs her not to tell their mother; she agrees. She can't go to school without her shoes. They work out a scheme where both of them share the same shoes. Rimzim will wear them to school in the morning and hand them off to Pinu at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. However, Pinu always gets into trouble at school waiting for Rimzim to give him the shoes. She takes Pinu to their house to shows the place and they find out that family is poorer than them. A day after, Rimzim is attracted to a new shiny pair of shoes that the same poor girl is wearing. She asks her about what she did with her previous pair of shoes and when she learns that the girl had thrown away her old pair of shoes, she is greatly disappointed. Temporarily, Khogiram, desperate for money, borrows some gardening equipment and heads off with Pinu to the rich suburbs of the town to find some gardening work. They try many mansions until a mansion belonging to a 6-year-old girl and her grandmother agreed. While Pinu plays with the 6-year-old girl, his father works. Meanwhile, Pinu comes to know of the Interschool Marathon where one of the prizes is a pair of shoes. Pinu enters the marathon race in the hope of receiving the third prize of a new pair of sneakers (the first prize being free education to the winner till he completes high school), which he could exchange for girl sneakers and give to Rimzim. He accidentally wins the race and is placed first. He is shocked and cries on the podium as he watches in despair at the new pair of sneakers being awarded to the third placed runner. The film ends with Rimzim finding out that she will not get a new pair of shoes, but there is a quick shot of their father's bicycle at the end of the movie that shows what appears to be red shoes with red trimming for Rimzim and another pair of white basketball shoes, presumably for Pinu, whose old shoes were torn from so much use.

URL last accessed 2010-03-26. he apprenticed at the age of 17 at the Allaire shops, where he developed a new type of steam cut-off valve for steam engines. He had perfected his invention by 1841. Sickels obtained a patent for this invention, which he called 'Manner of constructing the apparatus for lifting, tripping, and regulating the closing of valves of steam engines' on March 20, 1842 (U.S. patent number 2631).https://www.google.com/patents/US2631 Thurston (1878:317) relates \\"It was introduced by the inventor in a form which especially adapted it to use with the beam-engine used on the Eastern waters of the United States, and was adapted to stationary engines by Messrs. Thurston, Greene & Co., of Providence, R. I., who made use of it for some years before any other form of \\"drop cut-off\\" came into general use. The Sickels cut-off consisted of a set of steam-valves, usually independent of the exhaust-valves, and each raised by a catch, which could be thrown out, at the proper moment, by a wedge with which it came in contact as it rose with the opening valve. This wedge, or other equivalent device, was so adjusted that the valve should be detached and fall to its seat when the piston reached that point in its movement, after taking steam, at which expansion was to commence. From this point, no steam entering the cylinder, the piston was impelled by the expanding vapor. The valve was usually the double-poppet.\\". As described by Somerscales (1990:283) it was 'a quick-closing valve gear using poppet valves, and a trip gear to control the cut-off ... with gravity assisted closure ... Sickels used a water-filled dashpot to decelerate the valve smoothly as it approached the end of its travel.'. The device was not applied to the slide valve, which later became so ubiquitous in steam engines, but to poppet valves (also known as 'puppet valves' and 'drop valves'). These were first used by Watt for his beam engines in the 1770s or 1780s. Watt had fitted two conical valves to the upper steam passage to the steam cylinder and two to the lower passage. This is well illustrated in the text by Lardner (1840). This arrangement of two such valves per steam passage was described as the 'double-beat', 'balanced' or 'equilibrium' poppet valve by various authors (see e.g. Clark 1891). A schematic of equilibrium poppet valves appears in Buchanan and Watkins (1976) reproduced with further discussion in connection with Sickels by Somerscales (1990).Somerscales 1990 op.cit. However to reiterate, it is not the double poppet valve that can be attributed to Sickels, but a particular manner of its operation. In 1843 and 1845 he further improved his design.http://www.google.com/patents/US4202 Sickel's new type of valve made high-pressure steam engines possible, and it was copied extensively and appeared soon also in the Corliss engine. Sickels sued Corliss and later others for patent infringement, but although he won these court cases, they ultimately just consumed his own modest fortune: by the time the Corliss case was decided, the patents had expired, and in at least one other case, the defendant company failed shortly before the judgment is Sickels's favor was entered. In the late 1840s, he began working on a steam-powered steering device for ships, on which he obtained U.S. patent 9713 on May 10, 1853.National Museum of American History: Steam steering gear patent model . URL last accessed 2010-03-26.http://www.google.com/patents/US9713 While the device worked, he did not succeed to find a buyer. Sickels even went to England, where he also obtained patents on his steering device, but having failed to sell his invention there either, he returned in 1867 to the U.S. In 1891 he patented a cam-operated actuating mechanism for steam poppet valves (relating back to his 1842 patent), superseding the complex mechanism he patented in 1845 and had re-issued with further documentation in 1860.https://www.google.com/patents/USRE909 Subsequently, Sickels worked as a civil engineer in the American west, building bridges and railroads. In 1891, he became the head of the National Water Works in Kansas City.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Description It has an erect and spreading habit, growing to 1.5 m (5 ft) in height. Young branches are covered by short white hairs, but these are lost with age. The leaves are about 25 mm (1 in) long, and deeply divided into three narrow segments, each of which is typically further divided into two laciniae. Thus most leaves have 6 laciniae, though sometimes there are 8, and very rarely fewer than six. Each lacinia is about 3 mm wide, somewhat concave, with a linear margin. The single red flowers appear in September and October and again in March. It has a similar appearance to Adenanthos sericeus, but has leaf segments that are flattened rather than cylindrical like those of A. sericeus. Taxonomy The hybrid was originally formally described as a species Adenanthos cunninghamii by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner, his description published in 1845 in the first volume of Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet honours Allan Cunningham. A genetic analysis of Adenanthos cunninghamii was undertaken in 2003. This analysis confirmed that it is a hybrid between Adenanthos sericeus and Adenanthos cuneatus. Distribution The hybrid occurs in the vicinity of Torndirrup National Park including Shire Reserve to the south west of Albany as well as Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock, east of Albany. It is found in low woodland, shrub and heathland on deep, sandy soils. Conservation Adenanthos √ó cunningamii is classified as \\"Priority Four - Rare\\" on the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. As Adenanthos cunningamii it was listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 until its removal from the list in 2006. As a hybrid, it did not qualify as a species under section 528 of the Act. It is moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Cultivation Albany Woollybush is grown for its silvery foliage, rather than its relatively insignificant flowers, though the latter produce copious nectar that attracts honeyeaters. Although it is from a dry summer climate, it adapts to humid summer conditions. It prefers a position in full sun or part shade and freely draining light soil. Plants can be propagated relatively easily from cuttings of semi-mature current season's growth.

Annex I In total, Annex I Parties managed a cut of 3.3% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2004 (UNFCCC, 2007, p. 11). In 2007, projections indicated rising emissions of 4.2% between 1990 and 2010. This projection assumed that no further mitigation action would be taken. The reduction in the 1990s was driven significantly by economic restructuring in the economies-in-transition (EITs. See Kyoto Protocol ¬ß Intergovernmental Emissions Trading for the list of EITs). Emission reductions in the EITs had little to do with climate change policy (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 24). Some reductions in Annex I emissions have occurred due to policy measures, such as promoting energy efficiency (UNFCCC, 2007, p. 11). =Australia= On the change of government following the election in November 2007, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed the ratification immediately after assuming office on 3 December 2007, just before the meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; it took effect in March 2008. Australia's target is to limit its emissions to 8% above their 1990 level over the 2008‚Äì2012 period, i.e., their average emissions over the 2008‚Äì2012 period should be kept below 108% of their 1990 level (IEA, 2005, p. 51). According to the Australian government, Australia should meet its Kyoto target (IEA, 2005, p. 56; DCCEE, 2010). When he was in the opposition, Rudd commissioned Ross Garnaut to report on the economic effects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report was submitted to the Australian government on 30 September 2008. The policy of the Rudd government contrasts with that of the former Australian government, which refused to ratify the agreement on the ground that following the protocol would be costly. Policy Australia's position, under Prime Minister John Howard, was that it did not intend to ratify the treaty (IEA, 2005, p. 51). The justification for this was that: *the treaty did not cover 70% of global emissions; *developing countries are excluded from emission limitations; *and the-then largest GHG emitter, the US, had not ratified the treaty. The Howard government did intend to meet its Kyoto target, but without ratification (IEA, 2005, p. 51). As part of the 2004 budget, A$1.8 billion was committed towards its climate change strategy. A$700 million was directed towards low-emission technologies (IEA, 2005, p. 56). The Howard government, along with the United States, agreed to sign the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate at the ASEAN regional forum on 28 July 2005. Furthermore, the state of New South Wales (NSW) commenced the NSW greenhouse gas abatement scheme. This mandatory scheme of greenhouse gas emissions trading commenced on 1 January 2003 and is currently in trial by the state government in NSW alone. Notably, this scheme allows accredited certificate providers to trade emissions from households in the state. As of 2006, the scheme is still in place despite the outgoing Prime Minister's clear dismissal of emissions trading as a credible solution to climate change. Following the example of NSW, the national emissions trading scheme (NETS) has been established as an initiative of state and territory governments of Australia, all of which have Labor Party governments, except Western Australia. The purpose of NETS is to establish an intra-Australian carbon trading scheme to coordinate policy among regions. As the Constitution of Australia does not refer specifically to environmental matters (apart from water), the allocation of responsibility is to be resolved at a political level. In the later years of the Howard administration (1996‚Äì2007), the states governed by the Labor took steps to establish a NETS (a) to take action in a field where there were few mandatory federal steps and (b) as a means of facilitating ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the incoming Labor government. In May 2009, Kevin Rudd delayed and changed the carbon pollution reduction scheme: * the scheme would begin in 2011/2012, a year later than initially scheduled (it had been scheduled to begin on 1 July 2010); * there would be one-year fixed price of A$10 per permit in 2011/2012 (previously, price was to under the price cap of $40); * there would be an unlimited amount of permits available from the government in the first year (previously, estimated 300 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) was to be auctioned off); * a higher percentage of permits would be handed out, rather than auctioned off (previously, 60% or 90% of permits were to be handed out); * compensation would be canceled in 2010/2011 and reduced in 2011/2012; * households can reduce their carbon footprint by buying and retiring permits into an Australian carbon trust (previously, no such scheme was included); * subject to an international agreement, Australia would commit to a reduction of 25% from the 2000 level by 2020 (previously, there was to be a reduction of 15%); * 5% out of the 25% reduction could be achieved by the government purchase of international off-sets (previously, no such scheme was included). Greenpeace Greenpeace has called clause 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol the \\"Australia clause\\" on the ground that it unfairly made Australia a major beneficiary. The clause allows annex 1 countries with a high rate of land clearing in 1990 to set the level in that year as a base. Greenpeace argues that since Australia had an extremely high level of land clearing in 1990, Australia's \\"baseline\\" was unusually high compared to other countries.\\"Australia and the Kyoto Protocol\\", Greenpeace Asia Pacific, accessed 18 May 2007. Emissions In 2002, Australia represented about 1.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IEA, 2005, p. 51). Over the 1990‚Äì2002 period, Australia's gross emissions rose by 22%, which was surpassed by only four other International Energy Agency (IEA) members (IEA, 2005, p. 54). This was in large part due to economic growth. Net emissions (including changes in land-use and forestry) increased by 1.3% over this period. In 2005, Australia's GHG emissionsa made up 1.2% of the global total (MNP, 2007). Per- capita emissions are a country's total emissions divided by its population (Banuri et al., 1996, p. 95). In 2005, per capita emissions in Australia were 26.3 tons per capitaa (MNP, 2007). =Canada= On 17 December 2002, Canada ratified the treaty that came into force in February 2005, requiring it to reduce emissions to 6% below 1990 levels during the 2008‚Äì2012 commitment period (IEA, 2004, p. 52). Under Canada's Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act (KPIA), the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) is required to respond to the government's climate change plans (Canadian Government, 2010). In the assessment of NRTEE (2008), \\"Canada is not pursuing a policy objective of meeting the Kyoto Protocol emissions reductions targets. [...] [The] projected emissions profile described in the 2008 [government plan] would leave Canada in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.\\" On 13 December 2011, a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions In 2001, Canadian emissions had grown by more than 20% above their 1990 level (IEA, 2004, p. 49). High population and economic growth, added to the expansion of CO2 emissions-intensive sectors, such as oil sand production, were responsible for this growth in emissions. By 2004, CO2 emissions had risen to 27% above the level in 1990. In 2006 they were down to 21.7% above 1990 levels. In 2005, Canada's GHG emissionsa made up 2% of the global total (MNP, 2007). Per capita emissions in Canada were 23.2 tons per capita. Projections In 2004, Canada's emission projections under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e., predicted emissions should policy not be changed) indicated a rise of 33% on the 1990 level by 2010 (IEA, 2004, p. 52). This is a gap of approximately 240 Mt between its target and projected emissions. Politics When the treaty was ratified in 2002, numerous polls showed support for the Kyoto protocol at around 70%. Despite strong public support, there was still some opposition, particularly by the Canadian Alliance, a precursor to the governing Conservative Party, some business groups, and energy concerns, using arguments similar to those being voiced in the U.S. In particular, there was a fear that since U.S. companies would not be affected by the Kyoto Protocol, Canadian companies would be at a disadvantage. In 2005, a \\"war of words\\" was ongoing, primarily between Alberta, Canada's primary oil and gas producer, and the federal government. Between 1998 and 2004, Canada committed $3.7 billion towards investment on climate change activities (IEA, 2004, p. 52). The Climate Change Plan for Canada, released in November 2002, described priority areas for climate change policy. In January 2006, a Conservative minority government under Stephen Harper was elected, who previously has expressed opposition to Kyoto, and in particular to the international emission trading. Rona Ambrose, who replaced St√©phane Dion as the environment minister, has since endorsed and expressed interests in some types of emission trading. On 25 April 2006, Ambrose announced that Canada would have no chance of meeting its targets under Kyoto, but would look to participate in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate sponsored by the U.S. \\"We've been looking at the Asia-Pacific Partnership for a number of months now because the key principles around [it] are very much in line with where our government wants to go,\\" Ambrose told reporters. On 2 May 2006, it was reported that the funding to meet the Kyoto standards had been cut, while the Harper government develops a new plan to take its place. As the co-chair of the UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi in November 2006, the Canadian government received criticism from environmental groups and other governments for its position. On 4 January 2007, Rona Ambrose moved from the Ministry of the Environment to become Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The environment portfolio went to John Baird, the former President of the Treasury Board. The federal government has introduced legislation to set mandatory emissions targets for industry, but they will not take effect until 2012, with a benchmark date of 2006 as opposed to Kyoto's 1990. The government has since begun working with opposition parties to modify the legislation. A private member's bill was put forth by Pablo Rodriguez, Liberal, to force the government to \\"ensure that Canada meets its global climate change obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\\" With the support of the Liberals, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, and with the current minority situation, the bill passed the House of Commons on 14 February 2007 with a vote of 161 to 113. The Senate passed the bill, and it received Royal Assent on 22 June 2007. However, the government, as promised, has largely ignored the bill, which was to force the government 60 days to form a detailed plan, citing economic reasons. In May 2007, the Friends of the Earth sued the federal government for failing to meet the Kyoto Protocol obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The obligations were based on a clause in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act that requires Ottawa to \\"prevent air pollution that violates an international agreement binding on Canada\\". Canada's obligation to the treaty began in 2008. Regardless of the federal policy, some provinces are pursuing policies to restrain emissions, including Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba as part of the Western Climate Initiative. Since 2003 Alberta operates a carbon offset program. Environmental groups Environmental groups in Canada are working together to demand that Canadian politicians take the threat of climate change seriously and make the necessary changes to ensure the safety and health of future generations. Participating groups have created a petition called KYOTOplus, on which signatories commit to the following acts: ‚Ä¢ set a national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 25 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020; ‚Ä¢ implement an effective national plan to reach this target and help developing countries adapt and build low-carbon economies; and ‚Ä¢ adopt a strengthened second phase of the Kyoto Protocol at the United Nations climate change conference at Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009. KYOTOplus is a national, non-partisan, petition-centered campaign for urgent federal government action on climate change. There are over fifty partner organizations, including: Climate Action Network Canada, Sierra Club Canada, Sierra Youth Coalition, Oxfam Canada, the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition, Greenpeace Canada, KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives and the David Suzuki Foundation. Withdrawal of Canada On 13 December 2011, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. The announcement was a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (the 17th Conference of the Parties, or \\"COP 17\\"). At COP 17, the representatives of the Canadian government gave their support to a new international climate change agreement that \\"includes commitments from all major emitters.\\" Canadian representatives also stated that \\"the Kyoto Protocol is not where the solution lies ‚Äì it is an agreement that covers fewer than 30 per cent of global emissions (...).\\" The Canadian government invoked Canada's legal right to formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol on 12 December 2011. Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. Environment minister Peter Kent cited Canada's liability to \\"enormous financial penalties\\" under the treaty unless it withdrew. He also suggested that the recently signed Durban agreement may provide an alternative way forward. =Commentary= Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, said that she regretted Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty, and that \\"[whether] or not Canada is a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, it has a legal obligation under the [UNFCCC] to reduce its emissions, and a moral obligation to itself and future generations to lead in the global effort.\\" Canada's decision received a mostly negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries. A spokesman for France's foreign ministry called the move \\"bad news for the fight against climate change.\\" Japan's own environment minister, Goshi Hosono, urged Canada to stay in the protocol. Some countries, including India, were worried that Canada's decision might jeopardise future conferences. A spokesperson for the island nation of Tuvalu, significantly threatened by rising sea levels, accused Canada of an \\"act of sabotage\\" against his country. Australian government minister Greg Combet, however, defended the decision, saying that it did not mean Canada would not continue to \\"play its part in global efforts to tackle climate change\\". China called Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol \\"regrettable\\" and said that it went against the efforts of the international community. Canada's move came days after climate-change negotiators met to hammer-out a global deal in Durban, South Africa. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin expressed China's dismay at the news that Canada had pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol. Noting that the timing was particularly bad, because negotiators at the just-concluded Durban conference made what he described as important progress on the issue of the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period. The UK's Guardian newspaper reported on Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty. According to the Guardian, \\"Canada's inaction was blamed by some on its desire to protect the lucrative but highly polluting exploitation of tar sands, the second biggest oil reserve in the world.\\" =Europe= European Union On 31 May 2002, all fifteen then- members of the European Union deposited the relevant ratification paperwork at the UN. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 15 member countries that were Member States of the EU when the Protocol was agreed (EU-15) are committed to reducing their collective GHG emissions in the period 2008‚Äì12 to 8% below levels in 1990 (EEA, 2009, p. 9). All but one EU Member State (Austria) anticipate that they will meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (EEA, 2009, pp. 11‚Äì12). Denmark has committed itself to reducing its emissions by 21%. On 10 January 2007, the European Commission announced plans for a European Union energy policy that included a unilateral 20% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020. The EU has consistently been one of the major nominal supporters of the Kyoto Protocol, negotiating hard to get wavering countries on board. In December 2002, the EU created an emissions trading system (EU ETS) in an effort to meet these tough targets. Quotas were introduced in six key industries: energy, steel, cement, glass, brick making, and paper/cardboard. There are also fines for member nations that fail to meet their obligations, starting at ‚Ç¨40/ton of carbon dioxide in 2005, and rising to ‚Ç¨100/ton in 2008. The position of the EU is not without controversy in Protocol negotiations, however. One criticism is that, rather than reducing 8%, all the EU member countries should cut 15% as the EU insisted a uniform target of 15% for other developed countries during the negotiation while allowing itself to share a big reduction in the former East Germany to meet the 15% goal for the entire EU. According to Aldy et al. (2003, p. 7), the \\"hot air\\" in German and UK targets allows the EU to meet its Kyoto target at low cost. Both the EU (as the European Community) and its member states are signatories to the Kyoto treaty. Greece, however was excluded from the Kyoto Protocol on Earth Day (22 April 2008) due to unfulfilled commitment of creating the adequate mechanisms of monitoring and reporting emissions, which is the minimum obligation, and delivering false reports by having no other data to report. A United Nations committee has decided to reinstate Greece in the emissions-trading system of the Kyoto Protocol after a seven-month suspension (on 15 November). Emissions In 2005, the EU-27 made up 11% of total global GHG emissionsa (MNP, 2007). Per capita emissionsa were 10.6 tons per capita. Transport CO2 emissions in the EU grew by 32% between 1990 and 2004 The share of transport in CO2 emissions was 21% in 1990, but by 2004 this had grown to 28%. In 2017, 27% of the EU-28 greenhouse gas emissions came from transportation with 5% of these emissions coming from international aviation and maritime emissions, this was a 2.2% overall increase in this sector from the year before. =France= France's Kyoto commitment is to cap its emissions at their 1990 levels (Stern, 2007, p. 456). The country has a national objective to reduce emissions by 25% from their 1990 levels by 2020, and a long-term target to reduce emissions 75‚Äì80% by 2050. In 2002, France's total GHG emissions were roughly equivalent to 1990 levels, and 6.4% below 1990 levels when accounting for sink enhancements, as allowed under the Protocol (IEA, 2004, p. 58). In 2001, France's per capita emissions were 6.32 tCO2 per capita. Only five other IEA countries had lower levels (p. 59). France's CO2 intensity of GDP (energy-related CO2 emissions per gross domestic production (GDP)) was the fifth-lowest among all IEA countries. In 2004, France shut down its last coal mine, and now gets 80% of its electricity from nuclear power and therefore has relatively low CO2 emissions, except for its transport sector. =Germany= Germany has taken on a target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its GHG emissions by 21% compared with the base year 1990 (and in some cases, 1995) (IEA, 2007, pp. 44‚Äì45). Through 2004, Germany reduced its total GHG emissions by 17.4% (p. 45). Including the effects of land-use change increases this to 18.5%. The two main approaches Germany has used to meet its Kyoto target are reductions from the EU ETS, and reductions from the transport, household, and small business sectors (p. 51). Germany's progress towards its Kyoto target benefits from its reunification in 1990 (Liverman, 2008, p. 12). This is because of the reduction in emissions of East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. CO2 emissions in Germany fell 12% between 1990 and 1995 (Barrett, 1998, p. 34). Germany reduced gas emissions by 22.4% between 1990 and 2008. On 28 June 2006, the German government announced that it would exempt its coal industry from requirements under the E.U. internal emission trading system. Claudia Kemfert, an energy professor at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin said, \\"For all its support for a clean environment and the Kyoto Protocol, the cabinet decision is very disappointing. The energy lobbies have played a big role in this decision.\\" However, Germany's voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 21% from the level in 1990 has practically been met, because emission has already been reduced by 19%. Germany is thus contributing 75% of the 8% reduction promised by the E.U. =United Kingdom= According to the UK government, projections indicate that the UK's GHG emissions will fall about 23% below base year levels by 2010 (DECC, 2009, p. 3). The UK's Kyoto target of a 12.5% reduction in emissions on their 1990 level (Stern, 2007, p. 456) benefits from the country's relatively high emissions in that year (1990) (Liverman, 2008, p. 12). Compared to their 1990 level, UK emissions in 1995 were lower by 7%. This was despite the fact that the UK had not adopted a radical policy to reduce emissions (Barrett, 1998, p. 34). Since 1990, the UK has privatized its energy-consuming industries, which has helped to increase their energy efficiency (US Senate, 2005, p. 218). The UK has also liberalized its electricity and gas systems, resulting in a change from coal to gas (the \\"dash for gas\\"), which has lowered emissions. It is estimated that these changes have contributed about half of the total observed reductions in UK CO2 emissions. The energy policy of the United Kingdom fully endorses goals for carbon dioxide emissions reduction and has committed to proportionate reduction in national emissions on a phased basis. The U.K. is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. On 13 March 2007, a draft Climate Change Bill was published after cross-party pressure over several years, led by environmental groups. Informed by the Energy White Paper 2003,Energy White Paper 2003 , Department of Trade and Industry, published February 2002, accessed 19 May 2007 the bill aims to achieve a mandatory reduction of 60% in the carbon emission from the 1990 level by 2050, with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change , Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, published 13 March 2007. Retrieved 13 March 2007. On 26 November 2008, the Climate Change Act became law with a target of 80% reduction over 1990.Climate Change Act 2008 , Department of Energy and Climate Change webpage, retrieved 11 October 2009. The U.K. is the first country to ratify a law with such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target. The U.K. currently appears on course to meet its Kyoto limitation for the basket of greenhouse gases, assuming the government is able to curb CO‚ÇÇ emissions between 2007 and 2008 to 2012. Although the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the UK have fallen, annual net carbon dioxide emission has increased by about 2% since the Labour Party came to power in 1997. As a result, it now seems highly unlikely that the government will be able to honour its pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from the 1990 level by 2010, unless an immediate and drastic action is taken under after the ratification of the Climate Change Bill. Norway Norway's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol is to restrict its increase of GHGs to 1% above the 1990 level by the commitment period 2008‚Äì2012 (IEA, 2005, p. 46). In 2003, total emissions were 9% above the 1990 level. 99% of Norway's electricity from CO2-free hydropower. Oil and gas extraction activities contributed 74% to the total increase of CO2 in the period 1990‚Äì2003. The Norwegian government (2009, p. 11) projected a rise in GHG emissions of 15% from 1990 to 2010. Measures and policies adopted after autumn 2008 are not included in the baseline scenario (i.e., the predicted emissions that would occur without additional policy measures) for this projection (p. 55). Between 1990 and 2007, Norway's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 12%. As well as directly reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions, Norway's idea for carbon neutrality is to finance reforestation in China, a legal provision of the Kyoto protocol. =Japan= Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol in June 2002, and has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 6% below their 1990 levels (IEA, 2008, p. 47). Estimates for 2005 showed that Japan's emissions were 7.8% higher than in the base year. To meet its Kyoto target, the government aims for a 0.6% reduction in domestic GHG emissions compared with the base year. It also aims to meet part of its target through a forest sink of 13 million tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to a 3.8% cut. Another reduction of 1.6% is aimed for using the Kyoto flexible mechanisms. According to IEA (2008, p. 45), Japan is a world leader in the field of sustainable energy policies. The legislation guiding Japan's efforts to reduce emissions is the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan, passed in 2005 and later amended (p. 47). This Plan includes about 60 policies and measures. Most of these policies and measures are related to improved energy efficiency. When measured using market exchange rates, Japan's energy intensity in terms of total primary energy supply per unit of GDP is the lowest among IEA countries (p. 53). Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, its energy intensity is one of the lowest. Emissions In 2005, Japan's energy-related CO2 per capita emissions were 9.5 metric tons per head of population (World Bank, 2010, p. 362). Japan's total energy- related CO2 emissions made up 4.57% of global emissions in this year. Over the period 1850‚Äì2005, Japan's cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions were 46.1 billion metric tons. =New Zealand= New Zealand signed the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC on 22 May 1998 and ratified it on 19 December 2002. New Zealand's target is to limit net greenhouse gas emissions for the five-year 2008‚Äì2012 commitment period to five times the 1990 gross volume of GHG emissions. New Zealand may meet this target by either reducing emissions or by obtaining carbon credits from the international market or from domestic carbon sinks. The credits may be any of the Kyoto units; Assigned amount units (AAU), removal units (RMU), Emission Reduction Units (ERU) and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In April 2012, the projection of New Zealand's net Kyoto position was a surplus of 23.1 million emissions units valued at NZ$189 million, based on an international carbon price of 5.03 Euro per tonne. On 9 November 2012, the New Zealand Government announced it would make climate pledges for the period from 2013 to 2020 under the UNFCCC process instead of adopting a binding limit under a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. At the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference New Zealand was awarded two 'Fossil of the Day' awards for \\"actively hampering international progress\\". The New Zealand Youth Delegation heavily criticised the New Zealand government, saying New Zealand's decision not to sign up for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol was \\"embarrassing, short-sighted and irresponsible\\". =Russia= Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Russian Federation committed itself to keeping its GHG emissions at the base year level during the first Kyoto commitment period from 2008‚Äì2012 (UNFCCC, 2009, p. 3). UNFCCC (2009, p. 11) reported that Russian GHG emissions were projected to decline by 28% relative to base year level by 2010. The process of economic transition in the Russian Federation was accompanied by a sharp decline in its GDP in the 1990s (p. 4). Since 1998, the Russian Federation has experienced strong economic growth. In the period 1990‚Äì2006, emissions decreased by 33%. The difference between GDP and emissions was mainly driven by: *shifts in the structure of the economy; *reduced share of oil and coal in the primary energy supply and an increase in the share of natural gas and nuclear power; *a decline in the transport and agriculture sectors; *a decrease in population; *an increase in energy efficiency. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of the expected emission savings from Joint Implementation (JI) projects by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 21). These savings are projected to amount to 190 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) over the 2008‚Äì2012 period (p. 23). Politics The interest of the Russian government in accessing the Kyoto Protocol was associated with the G-8 meeting in Genoa in 2001, where the heads of state of the eight countries had a very emotional discussion about the need to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was neutral in the discussion, proposed to organise a conference where politicians and scientists representatives could discuss all issues related to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This proposal was supported unanimously and in 2003 Russia hosted the World Conference on Climate Change. Since 2001, Vladimir Putin had received a large number of appeals from the heads of foreign states about the need for Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, so he instructed Andrey Illarionov to find out whether the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol was in Russia's national interest. Not fully trusting experts of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Andrey Illarionov decided to address the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yury Osipov, and climatologist, Yuri Izrael, with a request to involve Russian leading scientists in the discussion of this issue. On May 17, 2004, Yury Osipov outlined his position on the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol by Vladimir Putin. Yury Osipov noted that during the discussion, scientists had the opinion that the Kyoto Protocol does not have a scientific basis and is not effective for achieving the final goal of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. If Russia would ratify the Kyoto Protocol, then it would be impossible for its economy to double the GDPAlexey Sobisevich The Activities of the Russian Academy of Science's Council Concerning the Kyoto Protocol and Discussions Around Climate Change // Abstracts of The Second Eurasian RISK-2020 Conference and Symposium RISK-2020 (12th ‚Äì 19th April 2020). Balrampur, 2020. Pp. 74-75.. Despite negative attitudes of scientists Vladimir Putin approved the treaty on 4 November 2004, and Russia officially notified the United Nations of its ratification on 18 November 2004. The issue of Russian ratification was particularly closely watched in the international community, as the accord was brought into force 90 days after Russian ratification (16 February 2005). President Putin had earlier decided in favor of the protocol in September 2004, along with the Russian cabinet, against the opinion of the Russian Academy of Sciences, of the Ministry for Industry and Energy, and of the then- president's economic adviser, Andrey Illarionov, and in exchange for the EU's support for Russia's admission into the WTO. As anticipated, after this, ratification by the lower (22 October 2004) and upper house of parliament did not encounter any obstacles. There is an ongoing scientific debate on whether Russia will actually gain from selling credits for unused AAUs. =United States= The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol (IEA, 2007, p. 90). Doing so would have committed it to reduce GHG emissions by 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. Emissions of GHGs in the US increased by 16% between 1990 and 2005 (IEA, 2007, p. 83). In this period, the most substantial increase in volume were emissions from energy use, followed by industrial processes. In 2002, the US government set a goal to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy) (IEA, 2007, p. 87). The set goal is to reduce the GHG intensity of the US economy by 18% by 2012. To achieve this, policy has focused on supporting energy research and development, including support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), renewables, methane capture and use, and nuclear power. The America's Climate Security Act of 2007, also more commonly referred to in the U.S. as the \\"Cap and trade Bill\\", was proposed for greater U.S. alignment with the Kyoto standards and goals. Emissions Between 2001‚Äì2007, growth in US CO2 emissions was only 3%, comparable with to that of IEA Europe, and lower than that of a number of other countries, some of which are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (IEA, 2007, p. 90). In 2005, the US made up 16% of global GHG emissions,a and had per capita emissions of 24.1 tons of GHG per capita (MNP, 2007). Politics The United States (US), although a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, has neither ratified nor withdrawn from the Protocol. The signature alone is merely symbolic, as the Kyoto Protocol is non-binding on the United States unless ratified. =Clinton administration= On 25 July 1997, before the Kyoto Protocol was finalized (although it had been fully negotiated, and a penultimate draft was finished), the US Senate unanimously passed by a 95‚Äì0 vote the Byrd‚ÄìHagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing nations as well as industrialized nations or \\"would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States\\". On 12 November 1998, Vice President Al Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations. The Clinton Administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification. The Clinton Administration released an economic analysis in July 1998, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisors, which concluded that with emissions trading among the annex B/annex I countries, and participation of key developing countries in the \\"Clean Development Mechanism\\"‚Äîwhich grants the latter business-as-usual emissions rates through 2012‚Äîthe costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol could be reduced as much as 60% from many estimates. Estimates of the cost of achieving the Kyoto Protocol carbon reduction targets in the United States, as compared by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted losses to GDP of between 1.0% and 4.2% by 2010, reducing to between 0.5% and 2.0% by 2020. Some of these estimates assumed that action had been taken by 1998, and would be increased by delays in starting action. =Bush administration= Under the Presidency of George W. Bush, the US government recognized climate change as a serious environmental challenge (IEA, 2007, p. 87). The policy of the Bush administration was to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy). This policy allowed for absolute increases in emissions. The Bush administration viewed a policy to reduce absolute emissions as incompatible with continued economic growth. A number of states set state-level GHG targets, despite the absence of a federal level target. President George W. Bush did not submit the treaty for Senate ratification based on the exemption granted to China (now the world's largest gross emitter of carbon dioxide, although emission is low per capitaRoger Harrabin, China 'now top carbon polluter' BBC News, 2008-04-14, retrieved 2009-10-01. Archived ar WebCite). Bush opposed the treaty because of the strain he believed the treaty would put on the economy; he emphasized the uncertainties that he believed were present in the scientific evidence. Furthermore, the U.S. was concerned with broader exemptions of the treaty. For example, the U.S. did not support the split between annex I countries and others. At the G8 meeting in June 2005 administration officials expressed a desire for \\"practical commitments industrialized countries can meet without damaging their economies\\". According to those same officials, the United States is on track to fulfil its pledge to reduce its carbon intensity 18% by 2012. In 2002, the US National Environmental trust labelled carbon intensity, \\"a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise.\\"\\"National Environmental Trust Special Reports\\", 2002. Retrieved 12 August 2006 . The United States has signed the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, a pact that allows those countries to set their goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism. Supporters of the pact see it as complementing the Kyoto Protocol while being more flexible. The Administration's position was not uniformly accepted in the US For example, economist Paul Krugman noted that the target 18% reduction in carbon intensity is still actually an increase in overall emissions. The White House has also come under criticism for downplaying reports that link human activity and greenhouse gas emissions to climate change and that a White House official, former oil industry advocate and current Exxon Mobil officer, Philip Cooney, watered down descriptions of climate research that had already been approved by government scientists, charges the White House denies. Critics point to the Bush administration's close ties to the oil and gas industries. In June 2005, State Department papers showed the administration thanking Exxon executives for the company's \\"active involvement\\" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto. Input from the business lobby group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor. In 2002, Congressional researchers who examined the legal status of the Protocol advised that signature of the UNFCCC imposes an obligation to refrain from undermining the Protocol's object and purpose, and that while the President probably cannot implement the Protocol alone, Congress can create compatible laws on its own initiative. =Obama administration= President Barack Obama did not take any action with the senate that would change the position of the United States towards this protocol. When Obama was in Turkey in April 2009, he said that \\"it doesn't make sense for the United States to sign [the Kyoto Protocol] because [it] is about to end\\". At this time, two years and eleven months remained from the four-year commitment period. =States and local governments= The Framework Convention on Climate Change is a treaty negotiated between countries at the UN; thus individual states are not free to participate independently within this Protocol to the treaty. Nonetheless, several separate initiatives have started at the level of state or city. Eight Northeastern US states created the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a state level emissions capping and trading program, using their own independently-developed mechanisms. Their first allowances were auctioned in November 2008. *Participating states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Maryland (these states represent over 46 million people, 20% of the US population). *Observer states and regions: Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, Rhode Island. On 27 September 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law the bill AB 32, also known as the Global Warming Solutions Act, establishing a timetable to reduce the state's greenhouse-gas emissions, which rank at 12th-largest in the world, by 25% by the year 2020. This law effectively puts California in line with the Kyoto limitations, but at a date later than the 2008‚Äì2012 Kyoto commitment period. Many of the features of the Californian system are similar to the Kyoto mechanisms, although the scope and targets are different. The parties in the Western Climate Initiative expect to be compatible with some or all of the Californian model. As of 14 June 2009, 944 US cities in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, representing over 80 million Americans support Kyoto after Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle started a nationwide effort to get cities to agree to the protocol. On 29 October 2007, it was reported that Seattle met their target reduction in 2005, reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent since 1990. *Large participating cities: Albany; Albuquerque; Alexandria; Ann Arbor; Arlington; Atlanta; Austin; Baltimore; Berkeley; Boston; Charleston;Chattanooga; Chicago; Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Des Moines; Erie; Fayetteville; Hartford; Honolulu; Indianapolis; Jersey City; Lansing; Las Vegas; Lexington; Lincoln; Little Rock; Los Angeles; Louisville; Madison; Miami; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; Nashville; New Orleans; New York City; Oakland; Omaha; Orlando; Pasadena; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Portland; Providence; Richmond; Sacramento; Salt Lake City; San Antonio; San Francisco; San Jose; Santa Ana; Santa Fe; Seattle; St. Louis; Tacoma; Tallahassee; Tampa; Topeka; Tulsa; Virginia Beach; Washington, D.C.; West Palm Beach; Wilmington; Wilmington. *There is a full list of cities and mayors. Non-Annex I UNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most reporting non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income (p. 4). Most Parties included information on policies relating to sustainable development. Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care (p. 6). Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their environmental legislation to include global concerns such as climate change (p. 7). A few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions could affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of fossil fuels. Emissions GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7 billion tonnes (billion = 1,000,000,000) of CO2-eq. CO2 was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by methane (26%) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (11%). The energy sector was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO2-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8 tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties. *The Africa region's aggregate emissions were 1.6 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4 tonnes. *The Asia and Pacific region's aggregate emissions were 7.9 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6 tonnes. *The Latin America and Caribbean region's aggregate emissions were 2 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6 tonnes. *The \\"other\\" region includes Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Malta, Moldova, and Macedonia. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1 tonnes. Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9 billion tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7 billion tonnes. =Brazil= Brazil has a national objective to increase the share of alternative renewable energy sources (biomass, wind and small hydropower) to 10% by 2030. It also has programmes to protect public forests from deforestation (Stern, 2007, p. 456). =People's Republic of China= China has a number of domestic policy measures that affect its GHG emissions (Jones et al., 2008, p. 26). These include a target to reduce the energy intensity of their GDP by 20% during the 2005‚Äì10 period. China plans to expand renewable energy generation to 15% of total capacity by 2020 (Wang et al., p. 86). Other policies include (Jones et al., 2008, p. 26): *support for research and development; *reduced indirect taxation on renewable electricity generation; *investment subsidies, energy efficiency standards, and the closure of the most energy-inefficient state-owned enterprises. From 1995‚Äì2004, China energy efficiency efforts reduced its energy intensity by 30% (Wang et al., 2010, p. 87). From 2006‚Äì09, China achieved a 14.4% reduction in energy intensity. Renewables account for 8% of China's energy and 17% of its electricity. In response to the financial crisis, China implemented one of the world's largest stimulus's in efficient and clean energy (p. 85). Emissions In 2005, China made up 17% of global GHG emissions,a with per capita emissions of 5.8 tons of GHG per head (MNP, 2007). Another way of measuring GHG emissions is to measure the cumulative emissions that a country has emitted over time (IEA, 2007b, p. 199). Over a long time period, cumulative emissions provide an indication of a country's total contribution to GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Measured over the time period 1900‚Äì2005, China's cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions made up 8% of the global total (IEA, 2007b, p. 201). Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) A report by the Carbon Trust (2009) assessed the use of CDM in China. The CDM has been used to finance projects in China for renewable energy and HFC-23 reductions (HFC's are powerful greenhouse gases). For renewables, the CDM was judged to have helped to stimulate wind and small hydro power projects. Critics have argued that these policies would generally have taken place without the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 56). =India= India signed and ratified the Protocol in August 2002. Since India is exempted from the framework of the treaty, it is expected to gain from the protocol in terms of transfer of technology and related foreign investments. At the G8 meeting in June 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pointed out that the per-capita emission rates of the developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, India maintains that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. However, the U.S. and other Western nations assert that India, along with China, will account for most of the emissions in the coming decades, owing to their rapid industrialization and economic growth. Policies in India related to greenhouse gas emissions have included (Stern, 2007, p. 456; Jones et al., 2008, p. 26): *the 11th Five Year Plan, which contains mandatory and voluntary measures to increase efficiency in power generation and distribution *increased use of nuclear power and renewable energy *a target to increase energy efficiency by 20% by 2016‚Äì17 *expanded electricity supply to villages *policies designed to increase tree and forest cover *building codes designed to reduce energy consumption Emissions In 2005, India accounted for 5% of global GHG emissions,a with per capita emissions of 2.1 tons of GHG per head of population (MNP, 2007). Over the time period 1900‚Äì2005, India's contribution to the global total of cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions was 2% (IEA, 2007b, p. 201). =Pakistan= Although the Minister of State for environment Malik Min Aslam was at first not very receptive, he subsequently convinced the Shoukat Aziz cabinet to ratify the Protocol. The decision was taken in 2001 but due to international circumstances, it was announced in Argentina in 2004 and accepted in 2005, opening the way for the creation of a policy framework. On 11 January 2005, Pakistan submitted its instruments of accession to the Kyoto Protocol. The Ministry of Environment assigned the task to work as designated national authority (DNA). According to a news story by Khan (2009), it was expected that the Protocol would help Pakistan lower dependence on fossil fuels through renewable energy projects. Pakistan had a per capita income of US$492 in 2002‚Äì2003, and is a low-income country (Pakistan government, 2003, p. 15). The Pakistan government is concentrating on reducing the vulnerability of the country to current climatic events (p. 17). Though Pakistan is a developing country, the government is taking different steps to lower the pollution. CDM In February 2006, the national CDM operational strategy was approved, and on 27 April 2006, the first CDM project was approved by DNA. It was reduction of large N2O from nitric acid production (investor: Mitsubishi, Japan), with an estimated annual production of 1 million CERs. Finally, in November 2006, the first CDM project was registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Pakistan has specified preferences for the CDM projects, including (Pakistan government, 2006, pp. 3‚Äì4): *alternative and renewable energy *energy efficiency *fossil fuel co-generation (co-generation is the use of waste heat from thermal electricity-generation plants (Verbruggen, 2007)) *Land use, land use change, and forestry, e.g., biodiversity protection *waste management, e.g., reducing GHG emissions from latrines and animal waste (EcoSecurities, 2007, p. 72) So far, 23 CDM so far have been approved by the Pakistan government (n.d.). Emissions Over the period from July 1993 to June 1994, Pakistan's energy sector was by far the highest contributor to CO2 emissions, with a share of 81% of total CO2 emissions (Pakistan government, 2003, pp. 16). Pakistan's energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 94.1% between 1990 and 2005 (World Bank, 2010, p. 362). Pakistan's per capita emissions in 2005 were 0.8 tCO2 per head (p. 362). In 2005, Pakistan contributed 0.45% of the global total in energy-related CO2 emissions. Pakistan's cumulative emissions over the period 1850‚Äì2005 was 2.4 billion metric tons. Cumulative emissions before 1971 are based on data for East and West Pakistan. Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate The Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (APP) is a US-led effort to accelerate the voluntary development and deployment of clean energy technologies (UNEP, 2007, p. 257). The purpose of the Partnership is to address the issues of energy security, air pollution, and climate change (IEA, 2007, p. 51). The partner countries are Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea, and the United States (APP, n.d., p. 1). According to the APP (n.d.), the APP contributes to Partners' efforts under the UNFCCC, while \\"complementing\\" the Kyoto Protocol. Footnotes a Estimates by MNP (2007) are for the GHG emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production. Calculations are for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluor containing gases (the F-gases HFCs, PFCs and SF6). These estimates are subject to large uncertainties regarding CO2 emissions from deforestation; and the per country emissions of other GHGs (e.g., methane). There are also other large uncertainties that mean that small differences between countries are not significant. CO2 emissions from the decay of remaining biomass after biomass burning/deforestation are not included.

Following his retirement he advised HSBC on financial crime governance alongside former Director General of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Bill Hughes. Early life Hartnett studied Classics at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1973. Career Hartnett joined the then Inland Revenue in 1976. As a graduate tax inspector, he spent his first 10 years in Birmingham. He advanced to the position of Director of Capital and Savings in 1998. Following the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise in 2004, he became HMRC's Director General for Customer Contact and Compliance Strategy and then Director General for Business. He was one of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Revenue and Customs, the formal governing board of HMRC, from the board's creation in 2005 until his retirement, having previously been a board member of the Inland Revenue. On the Board, he acted as Director General of Policy and Technical. When Paul Gray resigned as chairman following the loss of the Child Benefit database, Hartnett took over the post in an acting capacity. After permanent replacements were appointed, Mike Clasper as non-executive chairman and Lesley Strathie as Chief Executive, Hartnett was appointed to a new post of Second Permanent Secretary for Tax, with responsibility for tax professionalism. In May 2013, Hartnett became a consultant to the tax firm Deloitte. =Incorrect income tax collection= In September 2010 Hartnett was widely criticised for refusing to apologise for the HMRC issue which involved millions of people being required to pay due but uncollected tax. It was claimed that HMRC had failed to collect PAYE correctly. He told BBC Radio 4 \\"I'm not sure I need to apologise ...We didn't get it wrong.\\" He later issued an unreserved apology, though no PAYE error had been identified. =Corporate tax avoidance= For a period after October 2010, protesters blockaded and protested outside Vodafone stores across the UK following allegations of tax evasion of up to ¬£6 billion, illustrated in a series of articles in Private Eye. These articles alleged preferential treatment of Vodafone due to personal connections between Hartnett and John Connors, Vodafone's head of tax, a former colleague at HMRC. In May 2011 Private Eye alleged Hartnett personally \\"shook hands\\" on a deal over a long- running tax avoidance dispute with Goldman Sachs dating back to 2002, without consulting HMRC lawyers, letting the US bank off around ¬£10m in interest. Complaints from HMRC informants that Hartnett personally intervened in settlement cases and agreed to \\"sweetheart deals\\" with no explanation or consultation with lawyers have also been published. In October 2011, The Guardian published leaked papers regarding the deal. Hartnett was presented by activists from UK Uncut with a spoof \\"Golden Handshake award\\" at a dinner in New College, Oxford honouring his retirement in September 2012. Several activists had donned evening dress and name badges to indicate that they were from Vodafone and Goldman Sachs, and effused over Hartnett's help in saving those companies billions of pounds in taxes. Robert Venables QC, who was at the dinner, first told the intruders to \\"depart immediately, before we set the dogs on you\\", before finally ejecting them with the final words \\"You are trespassing scum. Go\\".Charlie Cooper, \\"HMRC's former boss honoured ... for services to tax avoidance\\", The Independent, 25 September 2012Steven Reid, \\"Crashing the tax avoidance party\\", The Guardian, 25 September 2012 While HMRC boss, Hartnett negotiated a tax deal that granted HSBC's bankers virtually guaranteed immunity from prosecution for any crimes they might have committed relating to tax fraud in Switzerland.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/agreement-with-switzerland-to- secure-billions-in-unpaid-tax Later in January 2013, he moved on to work at HSBC. =Corporate hospitality= Hartnett was named by City University London in July 2010 as the most \\"wined and dined\\" civil servant in Britain, having been treated to corporate hospitality 107 times over a period of three years. He stated that his approach to tax disputes with large corporations was \\"handling disputes in a non-confrontational way and collaborating with customers wherever possible\\". Harnett claims that this approach secured larger settlements of tax collected faster and more cheaply than if HMRC had taken the taxpayers to court, but this is disputed by Private Eye, who cite particular deals made by Harnett including the arrangement with Vodafone that lost the exchequer approximately ¬£6 billion.

Apostle Thomas founded one of his \\"seven and a half churches\\" in Kollam. They were family or community churches as neither Holy Bible was codified nor cross was acknowledged as the symbol of Christian faith in the first century AD. The church founded by the Apostle at the ancient Kollam port of Tarsish (thevalakara) was re-constructed three times. The second re organising of the Tarsish Christian nambuthiri community which was still inside vedic Vaishnavism was in the 4th century when a Persian cross brought from a Red sea port was erected in accordance with the Nicaea sunnahodose the first ecumenical council of the Christian church, meeting in ancient Nicaea (now ƒ∞znik, Tur.). It was called by the emperor Constantine I, an unbaptized catechumen, or neophyte, who presided over the opening session and took part in the discussions declaration making the cross the symbol of Christian faith the World over for the first time. In 825 AD Mar S(abo)r ministered here reconstructing the Tarsi sh-a -palli at Thevalakara for the third time as the first church founded by him with Syrian liturgy after receiving the Tarsish-a-palli plates from Kulshekara kings which in reality laid the foundation of Christianity as a religion in Kerala outside Vedic Vaishnavism. =List of churches= * St. Marys Orthodox Syrian Church and Mar Abo Pilgrim Centre, Thevalakara * St Thomas Church, Latin Catholic kandachira * St. George Orthodox Church, Ambalathinnirappu * Palakkuzhi Marthoma Church Ambalathinnirappu * Mukhathala Marthoma Church Kureeppally * Mar Semavoon Destooni Orthodox Church, Manjakkala * Trinity Marthoma Church, Manjakkala * St. Mary's Malankara Catholic Church, Manjakkala * St. George Orthodox Church, Kulamudy * St. Jude Chapel, Santhi Bhavan, Nadutheri * St. George Orthodox Church, Nadutheri * Bethel AG Church, Nadutheri * Marthoma Church, Nadutheri * St. Stephen's Orthodox Church, Pandithitta * Tabor Marthoma Church, Pandithitta * Divya Rekshaka Latin Catholic Church (Romapally), Pandithitta * St. Thomas Marthoma Valliyapally ,Kottarakkara * Brethren Church, Pandithitta * St. Mary's Malankara Catholic Church, Pandithitta * Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Church, Pullichira * Sacred Heart Church, Kackottumoola * C.S.I.

Although he was a native of Britain, according to Zosimus his ancestors were Franks.Zosimus, VI.2.4-5  Life  After the deaths of the generals Nebiogastes and Iustinianus in 407, the Western usurper Constantine III appointed Edobichus and Gerontius as his magistri militum (commanders-in-chief of the army). Upon their promotions, they forced Sarus, the general of the Western Emperor Honorius, to end his siege of Constantine in Valence and retreat into Italy. However Gerontius decided to betray Constantine, and in 409 he proclaimed Maximus as emperor in Hispania. Upon hearing of this development, Constantine sent Edobichus to the Franks and the germanic tribes across the Rhine to raise reinforcements.Sozomen, IX.13.2 Meanwhile Gerontius invaded southern Gaul, found Constantine at Arles, and laid siege to the city until the Imperial general Constantius arrived on the scene and forced him to retreat. Despite being besieged now by Constantius, Constantine continued to hold Arles, having heard that Edobichus was nearby with the barbarian troops. When Edobichus crossed the Rhone with his troops, he encountered Constantius' force blocking his path. As he prepared to engage the Imperial force, Ulphilas fell upon his soldiers from behind and defeated them. Edobichus managed to flee the battlefield on horseback and fled to one Ecdichus who he believed was his friend. However Ecdicius, seeking a reward from Constantius slew Edobichus and brought his head to Constantius, but the Imperial general rewarded him only with praise.Sozomen, IX.14 Edobichus' death convinced Constantine to end his resistance, and the usurper took priestly vows before surrendering to the general Constantius.Sozomen, IX.15.1  References   Further sources  * Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, II.9. * Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire II, \\"Edobichus\\", p. 386\\\\.

Wagner produced consistent performances over the next 2 years (including a man of the match 8 wicket haul against India at Eden Park). Despite this, he struggled to maintain his place in the side and was not selected in either of New Zealand's 2 tests against England in 2015. Wagner returned to the side during Sri Lanka's tour for New Zealand in late 2015. He produced a series of strong performances, as New Zealand comfortably won the series. Skipper Brendon McCullum described Wagner before the Test as his \\"Workhorse\\". The performances earned him another call-up for the second test against Australia. Wagner bowled well, taking 7 wickets including 6 wickets in the first innings. Since then, Wagner has become a regular starter in the New Zealand test side. Wagner continued his fine form during New Zealand's tour of Zimbabwe in 2016, where he won the player of the series award. He took 11 wickets in the two match series, including a five wicket haul in the first test. New Zealand then toured Wagner's homeland of South Africa. In the second Test, while New Zealand were soundly beaten Wagner again led the attack, taking his fourth five wicket bag. In April 2017, he was named in New Zealand's One Day International (ODI) squad for the 2017 Ireland Tri-Nation Series. On 1 December 2017, Wagner became the opening partner to Trent Boult as Tim Southee was injured, and claimed his best figures of 7/39, which is also a New Zealand record to claim 7/39 within a day, and within two sessions of play. He was selected in the Test XI of the year 2017 by Cricinfo. http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2017/content/story/1130951.html In May 2018, he was one of twenty players to be awarded a new contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by New Zealand Cricket. In November 2018, in the second match against Pakistan, he took his 150th Test wicket. In December 2019, in the second Test against Australia, Wagner took his 200th Test wicket, and finished the 2019/20 home season ranked as the number 2 test bowler in the ICC's world rankings. Playing style In test cricket he bowls long spells with the older ball, relying on short deliveries and dogged adherence to plans to pick up wickets,http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/1066464.html even in wickets that are 'two-paced' and in pitches where it offers no swing or seam movement for bowlers, where he would bowl shorter than other pace bowlers to bounce the batsmen out. In domestic cricket he plays as an opening swing bowler. He also adapts the same style internationally on batting-friendly wickets.

Children in a South African township in 1989, during the republic's international isolation years International isolation is a penalty applied by the international community or a sizeable or powerful group of countries, like the United Nations, towards one nation, government or people group. The same term may also refer to the state a country finds itself in after being shunned by the international community of nations or the greater group of countries. The determinants of the greater group of countries rely on economic, political and cultural stability but since the global order is constantly changing with the rise of developing countries such grouping may change. Definitions International isolation is often the result of international sanctions against a specific country (or group of countries), but it may also be a result of a policy of isolationism by the country in question. Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, for example, ended up in a state of international isolation after decades of confrontation with the West and its critical politics against fellow Arab governments.Tripoli Greens - Libya's new government district in Tripoli Countries which have seceded from another state may find themselves under international isolation, like Abkhazia, which is only recognized by a handful of countries after breaking away from Georgia with the help of the Russian military. Northern Cyprus, the northern section of the island of Cyprus, finds itself in a similar situation. Usually such states and their interests are protected by a larger neighbour. Certain widely acknowledged terms or concepts, like \\"pariah state\\", have been coined to refer to countries that have isolated themselves internationally or have been isolated by sizable groups of nations. The characteristics of such a state are \\"...precarious diplomatic isolation, the absence of assured, credible security support or political moorings within big-power alliance structures, and ... [being] the targets of obsessive and unrelenting opprobrium and censure within international forums such as the United Nations.\\" One such State was the People's Republic of Kampuchea after 1979, when both the People's Republic of China and the United States pushed for its isolation in the international arena, after not having approved of the Vietnamese invasion to ouster the Khmer Rouge. Another example is when countries fail to comply with or drop out of international agreements. Canada's pull out of the Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gases in 2011 is such an example. The concept \\"falling off the map\\" was used by political writer V. S. Naipaul in reference to the growing international isolation of the Islamic Republic of Iran after being in the limelight during the times of Shah RezƒÅ Pahlavi and during the first years of the Revolution.V. S. Naipaul, Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions among the Converted Peoples, 1998 History International isolation contributed to the downfall of the Spanish Republican government following the Non-Intervention Agreement in the Spanish Civil War signed in August 1936 and supported by 24 nations. The Republic had to fight a war under virtually total international isolation and a de facto economic embargo that placed it at an insurmountable disadvantage against the rebel faction. Lacking badly needed assistance from the democratic powers such as France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the Spanish Republic was subject to a severe form of international isolation between 1936, shortly after the rebel coup, and the defeat of the loyalist forces in 1939. Maritime access for material from the Soviet Union‚Äîthe only country, together with Mexico, which defied the Non- intervention Pact‚Äî aid was effectively cut off by the attacks of Italian submarines and the French frontier remained closed.Beevor, Antony. The battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. pp. 289-290 Although imposed in the name of neutrality, the international isolation of the Spanish Republic ended up favouring the interests of the future Axis Powers.√Ångel Vi√±as, La Soledad de la Rep√∫blica One of the most famous examples in the second half of the 20th century was the international isolation of South Africa during the Apartheid years.Koos van Wyk, State elites and South Africa's international isolation: a longitudinal comparison of perception, Routledge While poverty is usually one of the results of international isolation, the elite in the Republic of South Africa was able to maintain its status and wealth, the most economically disadvantaged classes bearing the brunt of the situation. Burma, an isolated state owing to its harsh military rule, has one of the world's poorest healthcare systems despite the abundance of natural resources in the country.JICA - Signs of a Myanmar Spring? Throughout the 2011 Libyan civil war, a number of powerful countries pushed for the international isolation of colonel Muammar Gaddafi's Libyan Jamahiriya. International pressure, along with assistance to rebel groups, eventually contributed to Gaddafi's downfall and death. Also, in the 2011-2012 Syrian uprising, several foreign countries imposed tough sanctions against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

Season review Lazio appointed a new coach in Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson, snatching the Swede from an almost readied contract with Blackburn Rovers. Ex-Sampdoria man Eriksson brought playmaking secondary striker Roberto Mancini with him. In addition, he signed Vladimir Jugoviƒá and Alen Bok≈°iƒá from Juventus, with Bok≈°iƒá embarking on a second tenure at Lazio. Matias Almeyda also arrived at the club from Spanish side Sevilla, while wing-back Giuseppe Pancaro, signed from Cagliari, also proved to be a key player. The new players managed to form an effective unit that was involved in the battle for the title until the 28th round, when they lost 1-0 at home to Juventus in a game that completely turned the tide for Lazio. The loss to Juventus had a detrimental effect on the team's form and led to a poor run of one point in six matches, dropping the team down to seventh. It was the club's worst league position for more than five years, but Eriksson was saved by the fact that the team had been seriously in the hunt for the scudetto for the first time, plus it reached the finals of both the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup. Lazio won the Coppa Italia, but stood no chance against Inter and on-song Ronaldo in the UEFA Cup final, eventually losing 3-0. The 1997-98 season also saw the departure of club legend Giuseppe Signori, who failed to get on with Eriksson and was duly sold to Sampdoria as a long-overdue replacement for Mancini. Given the team's strong form at the time, his departure did not cause the same riots as had been the case when he was on the verge to be sold to Parma a few years earlier. Lazio's best player during the season was arguably Pavel Nedvƒõd, the Czech winger scoring eleven goals and revelling in the confidence he got from Eriksson.

The train dispatcher central chose to lead the runaway train in the direction of Sjurs√∏ya, along the Loenga‚ÄìAlnabru Line, where it derailed and rolled through a Statoil building in the terminal area at Sjurs√∏ya, a peninsula which is part of the Oslo ports facilities. The line leading to the container and petroleum port at Sjurs√∏ya is a branch of √òstfold Line, and is only used at low speeds. However, the empty carriages crashed into the harbour terminal at an estimated speed of more than 100 km/h (62 mph). At the most, the set of wagons had a speed of 90‚Äì140 km/h. According to police reports, three people were killed in the accident while four people were injured. Of these four, three were severely hurt and the fourth person received minor injuries. According to TV 2 Nyhetskanalen, the condition of three of the injured persons was critical. A similar accident occurred in 1981, when runaway freight cars belonging to Norwegian State Railways derailed near the bridge over Loenga, only 100 meters from Sjurs√∏ya. An incident with runaway CargoNet freight cars also occurred in the terminal area at Trondheim Central Station on 28 January 2010, but this accident caused only material damage.  The accident  The set of empty CargoNet wagons was parked at Alnabru Freight Terminal, pending use later in the day. The train sped downhill from Alnabru (about 90 m.a.s.l) for several miles, without a locomotive. The train hurtled out of control, smashing into a building and plunging into Oslofjord. The structure, where several people had been working, collapsed and part of the train fell into the fjord. According to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, the Norwegian National Rail Administration tried to derail the train using a derail switch at Alnabru Freight Terminal, but without success. The set of carriages was always rolling on a freight track, and therefore there was no danger that it would roll towards Oslo Central Station. When the train was driving through Loenga yard, the centralized traffic control set a derailer so the runaway freight train could derail automatically. But also this device failed. Exactly how the train cars became detached and began to roll from Alnabru is still a mystery. However, later it was clarified by Norwegian Accident Investigation Board that the brakes on the cars did not work as they should, but it remains unclear whether human or technical error prevented the track brakes from functioning properly.  Accident report  On 3 May 2010, the preliminary accident report was submitted by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board. It stated that were confusions between train managers at Alnabru which triggered the crash. It was a \\"misunderstanding between the shunter and another train manager\\" which caused the empty freight cars to roll. The train manager released the brakes on the carriages, in the belief that they were connected to a switcher, which they were not. When the runaway train was first discovered, it already had changed to track A5, which is one of the two tracks at Alnabru Freight Terminal that have no connection to a so-called emergency track. After that, there were no barriers in the proximity of Alnabru that could stop the runaway train. Human error is therefore seen as the main cause of the fatal train crash. Criminal charges On 14 September 2010 the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided to fine the Norwegian National Rail Administration and CargoNet with 15 and 7 million Norwegian Krone respectively.Gir kjempeb√∏ter etter Sjurs√∏ya-ulykken ‚Äì VG Nett om Godstogulykken Unlike the rail administration, CargoNet have not accepted the fine.CargoNet godtar ikke boten ‚Äì Nyheter ‚Äì Innenriks ‚Äì Aftenposten.no  See also  * List of rail accidents (2010‚Äì2019)  References  Category:Railway accidents in 2010 Category:Derailments in Norway Category:Runaway train disasters Category:2010 in Norway 2010 Category:√òstfold Line Category:Accidents and incidents involving CargoNet ","title":"Sjurs√∏ya train accident"},{"id":"26706572","text":"The logo of WAPC-CPAO.The West African Postal Conference, or Conference des Posts de L'Afrique de L'Ouest, was formed in 2001 as a forum for postal services in West African countries.

His first tour with the Springboks was to France, Italy, Ireland and England in late 2009 where he played in one test against Italy on 21 November 2009 and two touring matches. Hougaard helped his team to win both the Currie Cup in 2009, and the Super Rugby title in 2010, scoring tries in both finals Hougaard was selected and joined off the bench for South Africa's opening match scoring in the 65th minute in a 17-16 win over Wales. He was however dropped for the second game against Fiji which South Africa won 49-3 but started against Namibia in which he scored two tries and came off the bench against Samoa. South Africa was however knocked out of the Cup, losing 11-9 to Australia. Hougaard came on in the 50th minute during that match. Hougaard started all five games at scrum half against England and Argentina and scored one try against England. However, he was moved to the wing and his place at scrum half taken by the talented Ruan Pienaar in the first Championship Test against Australia on 8 September 2012. Hougaard signed a one-season contract with SA Rugby to represent the Blitzboks in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series and at the Rio Olympics. Played in the first four legs of the 2015/16 series and scored the winning try in the 3rd/4th playoff against Australia at the Dubai Sevens. He was a member of the South African Sevens team that won a bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro Hougaard was included as a travelling reserve, but was included on the bench for the final day of the Rugby sevens tournament after Seabelo Senatla injured his wrist during the pool stages. After the medal ceremony Hougaard offered his Bronze medal to Senatla, stating that: \\"he deserves it more\\".

'The Lysaker Action') was a sabotage action in World War II which occurred in Norway on the night between 13 and 14 April 1940 when a bridge at Lysaker, bordering Oslo, was blown up. Background Lysaker was, and still is, an important transport hub situated near the mouth of the river Lysakerelva, which forms the border between B√¶rum and Oslo (in 1940: B√¶rum and Aker). The Drammen Line railway crosses Lysakerelva with its own bridge at Lysaker, as does the European route E18 highway. The highway is the main connection between Oslo and western parts of Norway. On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded then-neutral Norway in Operation Weser√ºbung. Oslo Airport, Fornebu, situated very close to Lysaker, was especially crucial in the quick attack, while the highway was crucial to German troop transport. Also on 9 April, Nazi Vidkun Quisling staged a coup d'etat. Incident The sabotage occurred on the night between 13 and 14 April 1940, when Oluf Reed-Olsen and the brothers Leif Moe and K√•re Moe blew up the bridge at Lysaker. According to Reed Olsen's memoirs, the saboteurs had been recruited by British intelligence and were part of a coordinated action against four bridges north of Oslo. The goal was to relieve the German pressure on the Norwegian front lines and allow a respite for new position to be established. The saboteurs were accustomed to using dynamite for civilian purposes, but had no saboteur training. The action, using some 30 kg of stolen dynamite, blew a hole in the roadway of the bridge and rendered it temporarily impassable for traffic. The actions against the other bridges, one between Drammen and H√∏nefoss, and two more at Sandvika, were exposed in the preparatory phase and two men arrested by the Germans. The incident was linked to a speech made by J. H. Marshall-Cornwall in BBC the day before, in which he encouraged Norwegians to destroy telephone and road connections. The reason this particular bridge was chosen, was an amassing of Norwegian troops near Sollih√∏gda west of Oslo. German troops were concentrated in Oslo, and a military excursion to the woody areas around Sollih√∏gda could be imminent. Consequences The sabotage contributed to the surfacing of the Administrative Council. This council consisted of a group of prominent men who had come together already on 12 April to discuss a Norwegian administration without Vidkun Quisling. Then, on 14 April, Supreme Court Justice Paal Berg, County Governor Ingolf Elster Christensen and Bishop Eivind Berggrav appeared in the now Nazi-controlled Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation radio to lament the sabotage. Their messages were recorded and rerun throughout the day, and contained calls to cease violent resistance. The official Broadcasting Corporation policy since the Nazi usurping was similar: to spread a calm attitude in the people.Dahl, 1978: pp.65‚Äì71 Nikolaus von Falkenhorst also spoke in Norwegian radio, and blamed British broadcasts for stirring up a sentiment and will to sabotage in the Norwegian people.Dahl, 1978: pp.122‚Äì123 The same attitude was conveyed by Edvard Sylou-Creutz in his Norwegian- language broadcast from German soil.Dahl, 1978: p.131 Germans also faced the fact that they actively had to promote more cooperation with the existing establishment than did Quisling. Curt Br√§uer was instrumental in installing the Administrative Council, though he promised Adolf Hitler that Quisling would be a part of it. The Administrative Council replaced Quisling's coup government already on the next day, 15 April. Ingolf Elster Christensen chaired it. However, it became short-lived. Br√§uer was fired for not securing Quisling a seat, and the Reichskommissariat Norwegen took over, disestablishing the council on 25 September. For the Norwegian resistance movement in general, the bridge sabotage showed a possible path of action. Official Norwegian (government in exile) policy was to be careful with sabotage; this was essentially given up later, in 1944. Many other groups conducted organized sabotage from an earlier point. The saboteurs Reed-Olsen and K√•re Moe had to flee Norway; this happened by boat from Bestumkilen on 2 September.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 25, 2010. In the episode, Leslie organizes a reunion with the last four Pawnee park directors, but is disappointed when it turns out they despise each other. Meanwhile, Tom tries to take a photo of Ann and Mark for the city's summer catalog, while the budding relationship of Andy and April continues to develop. The episode was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Ken Whittingham. It featured a guest appearance by Michael Gross, best known for his role as Steven Keaton from Family Ties, as one of the former park directors. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Summer Catalog\\" was seen by 4.47 million household viewers. It suffered competition from CBS footage of the first round of the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which drew 9.68 million household viewers. \\"Summer Catalog\\" received generally positive reviews. Plot While working on the Pawnee summer catalog, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly organizes a reunion between Ron (Nick Offerman) and his three predecessors. She anticipates a joyous occasion and plans to write a letter about it for the catalog. However, none of the four men get along with each other, and all of them are difficult to get along with. One of them (Dakin Matthews) litters repeatedly, treats everybody disrespectfully, and cheerfully says he never gave a damn about the Parks department and only took the job because it had an easy path to job security and a lucrative pension. Another one (Jack Wallace) exhibits a sexist attitude, and tells Leslie she should not be working there due to menstruation issues. The third (Michael Gross) constantly talks about his affinity for marijuana, going so far as to say \\"I've planted marijuana in community gardens across this city,\\" and particularly clashes with Ron (who forced him out of the position years ago) who cheerfully confirms he screwed his predecessor over and otherwise is his usual detached self. Later, a frustrated Leslie decides she cannot write the catalog letter; she stops treating the former directors with any respect by telling the sexist to shut up and calling them \\"turds\\" when she briefly takes a throwaway picture and then walks away from without another word. Ron takes her out to dinner to apologize, and the two process their mutual respect for each other, and vow they will never grow to hate each other the way the four former directors do. Ron even tells Leslie that he wants her to take over his Parks Director position if he becomes Pawnee's City Manager. However, Ron cheerfully says in an interview that one of his first acts as City Manager would be to eliminate the Parks department, while Leslie gives an equally upbeat interview where she says one of her first acts as City Manager, were she to leapfrog Ron for the job, would be to double the department's size. Tom (Aziz Ansari) is tasked with taking the cover photo of the summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a community park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness is a reflection of their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic. Production \\"Summer Catalog\\" was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Ken Whittingham. The character Michael Tansley, one of the former parks directors, was played by guest actor by Michael Gross, best known for his role as Steven Keaton from Family Ties. At the end of the episode, Leslie and Ron have dinner at J.J.'s Diner, an eatery previously featured in the first season episode \\"The Reporter\\". Although the exterior shots of the restaurant are the same, the interior set of the diner is a completely different one from the other episode. Shortly after the episode aired, a copy of the Pawnee Summer Catalog 2010 that was featured in the episode was made available for download on the official Parks and Recreation website. The map of Pawnee contained within the catalog is based on the map of central Christchurch, New Zealand. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, two deleted scenes from \\"Summer Catalog\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first, a two-minute clip, April and Andy flirt while walking along a trail to set up Leslie's picnic. When April complains about her feet hurting, Andy volunteers to give her a piggyback ride. Later, Leslie tries to write her summer catalog letter based on the picnic, but struggles due to how rude the four men acted. The second clip, which lasted two minutes and 15 seconds, includes further scenes of Tom leading Ann and Mark through a photo shoot at the park. Tom forces them to enter into unusual, avant-garde poses, and yells at young children who get in the way of the shot while playing. Cultural references Leslie compares the summer catalog to the Pawnee version of Vogue, a fashion and lifestyle magazine. During one scene, Tom makes a joke, then says, \\"Am I right, Justin?\\" The line is a reference to Leslie's stylish ex-boyfriend Justin, played by actor Justin Theroux earlier in the season, who Tom desperately admired. When Jerry takes a bad picture for the catalog, he indicates he will use the graphics software Adobe Photoshop to change the image, prompting April to ask, \\"Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?\\" During the picnic, when Andy and April are talking, Andy talks about writing a song called \\"Life is a Picnic‚Äù. Andy makes a reference to NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 25, 2010, \\"Summer Catalog\\" was seen by 4.47 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. For the second week in a row, the show suffered in comparison to CBS footage of the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which drew an average of 9.68 million household viewers during Parks and Recreation's 8:30 p.m. time-slot. Also for the second consecutive week, Parks and Recreation was outperformed by the ABC drama series FlashForward, which drew 6.2 million household viewers. \\"Summer Catalog\\" had an overall 2.9 rating/6 share, and a 3/1 rating/11 share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. \\"Summer Catalog\\" received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, called the episode a \\"nice character piece for most of the ensemble\\", and said it demonstrated how much Leslie has developed as a character since the first season. He praised the jokes about Ron's hunger and the scenes with Tom's demanding photography sessions. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker said the storylines moved along briskly, provided a \\"constant stream of laughs\\" and displayed the \\"rich texture\\" of the characters. Tucker also said the romances in Parks and Recreation were more believable than contemporary ones in shows like The Office and 30 Rock. Matt Fowler of IGN called it a \\"particularly strong\\" episode that used all of the characters well. Fowler especially liked that although Ron and Leslie bickered throughout the episode, they still displayed a mutual respect for each other. He also said Tom's photography sessions were a good way to display Ann and Mark's deteriorating relationship. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said \\"Summer Catalog\\" laid the foundation for several future developments, like changes to the Andy/April and Mark/Ann relationships, but also kept the episode funny and enjoyable. Heisler said Tom had the best lines of the episode. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she was saddened by the decline in Mark and Ann's relationship and the setback for the April and Andy courtship, and feared the subplot might not reach a satisfactory conclusion by the end of the season. Gallagher also said the main-plot with Leslie and the former park heads was predictable, and that guest star Michael Gross was underused. DVD release \\"Summer Catalog\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

Inception and club history The first meeting to organize \\"a young men's social club\\" was held at the home of Joseph A. Nesmith on November 11, 1882. The next few meetings were held between Nesmith's home and the home of George R. Richardson until the group rented a room at the Wyman's Exchange building. At that time, the first elected officials Included: * Percy Parker, President * Frederick W. Stickney Architect, Secretary * Frederick A. Chase Treasurer * George R. Richardson Director * Walter M. Lancaster Director Other members included Joseph & James Nesmith, George S. Motley, Theodore E. Parker Jr., Walter U. Lawson, Paul Butler, Samuel E. Stott, Charles H. Hooke, Harry V. Huse, Edward Ellingwood, Herbert P. Jefferson, Fred C. Church, Gerard Bement, Harry A. Brown, and Frank W. Howe. On May 19, 1883, the club officially became the \\"Yorick Gentlemen's Club\\". Through 1885, the club rented spaces in the Hildreth and Post Office Buildings. The club then took over a suite of rooms in the Mansur Building. In June 1900, a fire forced the club to relocate to the not-yet-named Yorick Building. Clubhouse The Yorick Club in Lowell, Massachusetts, c. 1910 On July 22, 1901, the members purchased the forty-year-old boarding house located at 91 Dutton Street. Originally, the three story brick building served as boarding for officials of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company. After the Yorick Club took over, architect Frederick W. Stickney, Secretary of the club, designed the renovations of the building. This became the permanent home of the Yorick Club for the next 78 years, until it was dissolved in 1979. The design of the original construction, as well as the later renovations, saved the building from \\"urban renewal\\" in the late 1960s. The building was then converted to dining facilities in 1978 and housed a variety of small restaurants. In 1994, the building was purchased by Scott and Kathy Plath and renamed Cobblestones Bar & Restaurant but retains the name of the \\"Yorick Building\\" as part of the Lowell National Historical Park Events and notoriety Just after the opening of the new building, Mayor Charles A. R. Dimon invited Chief Sachem of the Passaconaway Tribe of the Improved Order of Red Men for lunch at the Club.\\"Contributions of the Old Residents' Historical Association, Lowell, Volume 6\\" By Old Residents' Historical Association of Lowell (Mass.). In 1908, John O. Heinze, president of the Lowell Automobile Club and owner of the Heinze Electric Company, convinced the governor to allow the roads around Lowell to be used as a race track over a week around Labor Day. Backed by the Automobile Club of America, American Automobile Association, and the Lowell Automobile Club, the \\"Auto Carnival\\" was held. The Yorick Club Tropht was one of three trophy sponsored competitions alongside the Vesper Club Trophy and the Merrimack Valley Trophy.

Until her retirement Barbara Aland was also the director of Hermann-Kunst-Stiftung for Promotion of New Testament Research. She is still working academically in her retirement.  Relevance  Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland visiting Pope John Paul II (1984) Aland gained an international profile due to the work on the Novum Testamentum Graece and the Greek New Testament which she carried out with her husband Kurt Aland. Both of them collaborated significantly with an international and interconfessional group of theologians on the approvement and updating of the \\"Nestle-Aland\\" - Novum Testamentum Graece and also \\"Greek New Testament\\". These editions (published by the Institute in M√ºnster) form the basis of apprenticeship and research worldwide. She published the first installments of the \\"Editio Critica Maior\\" in 1997. This edition was the first to be based on the complete tradition of Greek manuscripts, patristic citations, and ancient versions. In 1999 she was a founding member of the \\"Academia Platonica Septima Monasteriensis\\", which does not focus its attention primarily on the works of Plato, but rather on the writings of his early interpreters, from ancient times until the Renaissance.

The provision also states, \\"If the official victim is an exceptionally high-level official, such as the President or the Vice President of the United States, an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential disruption of the governmental function.\\" There are many crimes against federal officials that do not require, as an element of the offense, that the offender know the status of the victim, but this enhancement does. The victimization of the government official need not be the offense of conviction; it is possible, for instance, for the defendant to be convicted of robbing a bank and to get the official victim enhancement for harming a uniformed police officer as he escapes. The assault on the officer is considered relevant conduct. In cases involving threats against the President of the United States, courts have applied the official victim enhancement, rejecting arguments that in order for it to apply, \\"the President actually [had] been harmed, or ... [knew] of the existence of the defendant's letter.\\" There has been a circuit split in the federal appellate courts as to whether crimes against local government officials qualify for the official victim enhancement. 0.1% of federal cases involve the official victim enhancement. The term \\"official victim\\" also is used in victimology to refer to a four-stage process in which a person progresses from being a harmed, injured or suffering person(s) to perceiving or defining oneself as a victim, to claiming the victim role from social control agents or significant others and then to social control agents' recognition of the role claim -- becoming an 'official victim' and receiving compensatory and supportive actions by social control agents.

Online (subscription only) at HighBeam. Considered by many as one of the best and greatest Arabian poets in the 20th century , he was also nicknamed The Greatest Arabian Poet Life Muhammad Mahdi Al-Jawahiri was born in 1899 in Najaf in Iraq. His father, 'Abd al-Husayn was a religious scholar among the clergy in Najaf who wanted his son to be a cleric as well. So he dressed him in an cleric's 'Abaya and turban at the age of ten. The origin of ‚ÄúAl-Jawahiri‚Äù goes back to his Najafi, Iraqi family. Since the 11th century Hijri (15th century CE), the most famous people have inhabited Najaf, and individuals named al-Najafi have earned the title ‚ÄúBejeweled‚Äù (or al-Jawahiri) for their relationship to the book of fiqh values (religious scholarship) which one of his family's ancestors Shaykh Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi had written. The books were called ‚Äúthe jewel of speech in explaining the laws of Islam‚Äù and was composed of 44 volumes. Afterwards he was known as the ‚Äúowner of the jewels,‚Äù and his family came to be called ‚Äúbejeweled‚Äù (al-Jawahiri). Muhammad Mahdi read the holy Qur'an and did not memorize it at an early age. Then his father sent him to great teachers to teach him reading, writing, grammar, rhetoric and jurisprudence . His father and others planned for him to learn speech from Nahj al-Balagha and poetry from the works of Abu Tayyib al- Mutanabi. Learning was organized at an early age and even in his childhood he displayed an inclination for literature. He began to read the Book of Eloquence and Demonstration by Al-Jahiz and the Muqaddimah by Ibn Khaldun, and collections of poetry. It was early in his life when he first wore the clothing of a religious man and he participated in the 1920 revolution against the British authorities. In 1928, he published the volume \\"Between Feelings and Emotions\\" his first poetry collection which he had been preparing since 1924 to distribute under the title \\"The Dangers of Poetry in Love, Nation and Ode.\\" Then he worked for a short period in the court of King Faysal I when he was crowned king of Iraq and when he was still wearing the turban of a cleric. Then he left the clergy just as he left work in Faysal's court. After he left Najaf for Baghdad, he went to work in the press, and put out a group of papers ‚Äì among them Al-Furat (The Euphrates), Al-Inqilab (The Coup), and Al-Ra'i al-'Am (The Common View). He was elected head of the union of Iraqi writers on several occasions. His brother Jaafar was killed during the Al-Wathbah uprising of 1948, which inspired one of his most famous poems, \\"My Brother Jaafar.\\" He recited the poem at Haydarkhana mosque to an audience of Sunnis, Shia and Jews during the same month of the massacre. A verse from the poem, \\"Do you know or do you not know/ that the wounds of victims are a mouth?\\" became an icon of modern Iraqi poetry.

They comprise three international style mixed use buildings on Mann Island, which lies on the waterfront between the Port of Liverpool Building and the Albert Dock. No.1 building is owned by Merseytravel although several floors are leased out to other companies Background Formerly rundown warehouses and dock buildings, the site directly between two of Liverpool's most historic buildings was heavily investigated before numerous proposals for new builds were submitted as part of a competition to create a 'Fourth Grace'. Three proposals were submitted, all of which received criticism for their appearance and contrast to the city's famed historic skyline. The work of Alsop Architects was chosen to become the 'Fourth Grace', however, it was beset with difficulties, and was cancelled in 2004 due to spiralling costs. It was only after all of these ideas were scrapped when the ¬£120 million Mann Island Development was chosen to become the new complex to occupy the site. The project Construction of the buildings, which are similar in height to the nearby Port of Liverpool Building, Cunard Building and Royal Liver Building began in 2008 during Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture (when regeneration within the city centre was at its peak). At the same time, work also began on a close neighbour to the Mann Island development - the Museum of Liverpool (not to be confused with World Museum Liverpool). Although the buildings have different heights and usage, each consists of 13 storeys. The Mann Island Buildings are home to 376 apartments (a mix of one, two and three bedroom), of retail/leisure units, of net office space and of covered space. The buildings The three buildings are to the south of the Mann Island roadway, opposite the Port of Liverpool Building, and are numbered (from east to west) No.1, No.11 and No.15 Mann Island. No.15, next to the Museum of Liverpool, is called the Latitude building and No.11 is the Longitude building. Connecting the two is a double-height glass atrium called Equator House which often hosts RIBA architectural displays and launch events for the Open Eye Gallery next-door. Both Latitude and Longitude are mixed commercial and residential spaces, with restaurants, caf√©s and galleries on the ground floor, and accommodation starting on the 2nd floor. There is a gap in the 1st floor, that was originally meant to be a mezzanine for the commercial spaces below, but this has now been adapted as private open plan office and co- working space. No.1 Mann Island, next to the Strand, is occupied almost entirely by Merseytravel and the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Two levels of car-parking extend beneath the Latitude and Longitude buildings, which is shared between residents and Merseytravel staff. Mann Island is home to the RIBA North gallery, opened in 2017. Reception Critical response to the development has been mixed. Alistair Sutherland (designer of Preston Crown Court and panel member of LUDCAP) declared it \\"a positive contribution\\" to the waterfront, and \\"a complementary contrast\\" to its neighbours; others have been more critical. The Daily Post in particular lamented the loss of several key views of the Pier head World Heritage Site. In 2012, it was nominated alongside the ArcelorMittal Orbit and Belfast's Titanic museum for the Carbuncle Cup, an architecture prize given annually by the magazine Building Design to \\"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months.\\" In 2015 Mann Island scooped a RIBA North West award.

It lies on the waterfront next to the River Mersey between the Albert Dock to the south and the Pier Head to the north. History Mann Island was formed in the 18th and 19th centuries as part of the Liverpool dock complex. It was a virtual island, with Georges Dock to the north, Canning Dock to the east and south, and the River Mersey to the west. It was connected to the shoreline by a narrow neck of land opposite James Street. It was the site of the Manchester Dock, opening onto the river, and two graving docks, opening into Canning Dock. It was also the location of the Great Western Railway warehouses, and the Mersey Railway pumping station, all of which are Grade II listed buildings. Later, in the 20th century, it was the site for the James Street station of the Liverpool Overhead Railway. The site ceased to be an \\"island\\" in 1899 when the Georges Dock was filled in to provide building land for the Port of Liverpool Building, and it became physically joined to the Pier Head. However the name was continued in the roadway which extended into the Pier Head from James Street. During the 20th century, Mann Island served as a tram and bus terminus for routes serving the south of the city, adjoining the Pier Head bus terminus serving the north. Mann Island has been the subject of a number of regeneration schemes, such as the ill-starred Fourth Grace project, which was under consideration from 2002 to 2006. When this was cancelled, it was replaced by a three part redevelopment scheme. Current use Mann Island has been subject to three redevelopment schemes. The first, occupying the third of the site next to the river, is the Museum of Liverpool, which replaced the Museum of Liverpool Life, opening on 19 July 2011. Secondly, the Liverpool Canal Link, which cuts through Mann Island via a lock system into the Canning Dock. The third, occupying the shoreside half of the site, are the Mann Island Buildings which are three modernist mixed-use private enterprise buildings.

The film stars James Rolleston, Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu, and Waititi. It is produced by Cliff Curtis, Ainsley Gardiner and Emanuel Michael and financed by the New Zealand Film Commission. In New Zealand, the film eclipsed previous records for a first week's box office takings for a local production. Boy went on to become the highest-grossing New Zealand film at the local box office. The soundtrack to Boy features New Zealand artists such as The Phoenix Foundation, who previously provided music for Waititi's film Eagle vs Shark. Plot The year is 1984. Alamein, known as Boy, is an 11-year-old boy living in Waihau Bay, in the ≈åp≈çtiki District of the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand, on a small farm with his grandmother, younger brother Rocky, and several cousins. Boy spends his time dreaming of Michael Jackson, hanging out with his friends Dallas and Dynasty, trying to impress Chardonnay, a girl at his school, talking to his pet goat, and making up wild stories about his estranged father, Alamein. Rocky, meanwhile, is a quiet, odd child, who believes he has dangerous superpowers because his mother died giving birth to him. One day, Boy and Rocky's grandmother leaves for a funeral in Wellington, leaving Boy in charge of the house and taking care of the other children. Boy is then surprised to see his father and two other men arrive at the farm. Boy is overjoyed to see Alamein return, thinking that he has come to take the boys away to live with him, but Rocky is uncertain about their father's sudden reappearance. It seems at first that Alamein has finally come back to be in his sons' lives, but it's soon revealed that he is actually there to find a bag of money that he had buried on the farm before being arrested by the police. With his patched gang, the Crazy Horses (which is just him and two friends), Alamein begins digging up the field, searching for the money. Boy sees this and offers to help, thinking Alamein is digging for treasure, and Alamein soon decides to hang out with Boy and be a father. He cuts his son's hair to look like Michael Jackson, and the two go on drives in Alamein's car and get revenge on Boy's school bullies. Boy brings Alamein marijuana to sell from a crop grown by Dallas and Dynasty's father, a member of a local gang. Alamein, uncomfortable with being called 'Dad,' convinces Boy to call him Shogun instead. Boy begins to see himself as an adult and a Crazy Horse, growing distant from his friends. However, Alamein, unable to find the money, becomes frustrated and drives off, leaving Boy behind. Boy continues to dig for the money alone, until he finally discovers it. Excited, Boy hides the moneybag in his goat's pen, then takes his father's Crazy Horses jacket and proudly treats his friends to ice blocks and lollies. When Alamein drives up, Boy goes to tell him that he has found the money, but Alamein hits Boy for stealing his jacket and angrily questions him about where he found the money for the ice blocks, leaving Boy humiliated. Alamein later apologizes, telling his son for the first time that he loves him, and Boy goes to retrieve the moneybag; only to find that it has been eaten by his goat. Alamein and Rocky continue to dig for the hidden money, making Boy uneasy. Boy decides to make up for losing the money by leading Alamein to the marijuana crop owned by Dallas and Dynasty's father, and Alamein gathers the entire crop. The group are spotted running away by Dynasty, who stares at Boy, betrayed. Later, Alamein takes his gang out to celebrate. Whilst waiting in the car with Boy, Rocky tells his brother that he likes their father, and wants to get to know him better. Another car then drives up, and the local gang gets out. Boy sees Dynasty sitting in the front seat with a black eye. The gang approaches Alamein and the Crazy Horses, confronting them over stealing their marijuana. At first, Boy imagines his dad successfully fighting off the gang in a Michael Jackson dance sequence, but reality comes back to him, and he sees the gang beat Alamein. While driving home, Alamein accidentally hits and kills Boy's goat. The next day, Alamein is abandoned by his men, who steal the marijuana and the car. Boy visits his mother's grave, drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and finally comes to terms with the fact that all of his happy, early memories of his father are make-believe, and Alamein was in fact not even there when Rocky was born. Meanwhile, Alamein sits in the barn, depressed that he has been unable to find his money. Rocky comes up to him and attempts to comfort him with his 'powers,' telling Alamein that he is sorry he killed his mother by being born. Just then, Boy comes in and scatters the shredded money at Alamein's feet, then begins hitting his father, screaming to know why he wasn't there when Boy and Rocky's mother died. Boy tells Alamein that they are nothing alike, then returns to the house to take care of his cousins. The next morning, Boy and Rocky's grandmother returns home, and Alamein is gone. Boy tells Rocky that Alamein has gone to Japan to train as a samurai. He reconnects with his friends and apologizes to Dynasty, then goes with Rocky to visit their mother's grave. The two boys find Alamein sitting there. Quietly, they join him, before Rocky asks, \\"How was Japan?\\" Cast * James Rolleston as Boy, a MƒÅori kid who is a huge fan of Michael Jackson, Boy dreams of becoming rich and going to the city with his father, brother, and his pet goat.

Production Director, actor and writer Taika Waititi Waititi started developing Boy soon after finishing the short film Two Cars, One Night, and it first emerged as a film called Choice. The project was accepted into the Sundance Writer's Lab in 2005, where Waititi workshopped it with script writers Frank Pierson, Susan Shilliday, David Benioff and Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal. Instead of making Boy his first film as a director, Waititi went on to make oddball romance Eagle vs Shark, and continued to develop the screenplay over the next three years. When the script was finally ready there was a small window of opportunity in which to make it. Waititi dropped the title Choice because he felt it would not translate to international audiences, and the film was retitled The Volcano. \\"It was a big pain about this kid's potential to be bigger than he is or just bloom or explode,\\" said Waititi. \\"So it was a character in the script as well. When we were shooting the film it was still called Volcano and during the editing. We ended up cutting a lot of the stuff out.\\" Waititi wanted to shoot the film in the place where he partly grew up, Waihau Bay. The story was set in summer, but it was challenging to shoot in the height of summer due to the area's popularity as a fishing and holiday destination. The film features the maize fields and the maize is harvested from late April. James Rolleston was not initially cast as the lead role of Boy. Another actor was already in place when Rolleston turned up for a costume fitting as an extra. Waititi gave him an audition and after reviewing the film clips, Rolleston was offered the role two days before shooting began.Audio Commentary: Taika Waititi, director; Cliff Curtis, Ainsley Gardiner, Emanuel Michael, producers.

Reception =Critical response= Based on 65 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 87%, with an average score of 7.3/10. Peter Calder of The New Zealand Herald gave the film five out of five stars. He praised the performances by the three main actors and said \\"it's hard to praise too highly the pitch-perfect tone of this movie.\\" =Box office= On release in New Zealand the film topped the box office receipts for the week, earning more on its opening day than any previous New Zealand film. The film grossed nearly $900,000 in its first seven days, beating Alice in Wonderland and homegrown pictures Whale Rider and The World's Fastest Indian. It also climbed above international animated-fantasy hit How to Train Your Dragon and mythical action flick Clash of the Titans. Boy then went on to become the highest-grossing New Zealand film to date on its own soil, taking over The World's Fastest Indian which had held the position for five years. =Awards= * AFI Fest Audience Award ‚Äì Best International Feature Film ‚Äì Taika Waititi ‚Äì Won * Asia Pacific Screen Award ‚Äì Best Children's Feature Film ‚Äì Ainsley Gardiner, Cliff Curtis, Emanuel Michael and Merata Mita ‚Äì Nominated * Berlin International Film Festival Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk Grand Prix ‚Äì Best Feature Film ‚Äì Taika Waititi ‚Äì Won * Melbourne International Film Festival Most Popular Feature Film ‚Äì Taika Waititi ‚Äì Won * Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize ‚Äì World Cinema ‚Äì Dramatic ‚Äì Taika Waititi ‚Äì Nominated * Sydney Film Festival Audience Award ‚Äì Best Feature Film ‚Äì Taika Waititi ‚Äì Won * New Zealand Film and TV Awards ‚Äì 13 nominations, seven wins including Best Feature Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay References External links  * Category:2010 films Category:2010s coming-of-age comedy-drama films Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand comedy- drama films Category:New Zealand coming-of-age films Category:Vertigo Films films Category:English-language films Category:MƒÅori-language films Category:Films directed by Taika Waititi Category:Films set in New Zealand Category:Films set in 1984 Category:Films shot in New Zealand Category:2010 comedy films Category:2010 drama films Category:Treasure hunt films ","title":"Boy (2010 film)"},{"id":"26707168","title":"Jos√© Mar√≠a Calatrava y Peinado"},{"id":"26707176","text":"Lieutenant Leone Nakarawa (born 2 April 1988) is a Fijian rugby union footballer and Olympic gold medalist.

He was selected in the 1959 minor league draft by the Cincinnati Redlegs. Duckworth had not yet been called up to the major leagues when the Washington Senators selected him in the 1962 Rule 5 draft. Duckworth was on Washington's 1963 opening day roster and won his first big league game in relief against the New York Yankees on May 26, 1963. While playing for the Senators in 1964, Duckworth missed a series in California due to his fear of flying. Washington docked him three days pay. On September 4, 1965, Duckworth struck out eight of the first nine Detroit Tigers batters he faced. He finished the game with 11 strikeouts in seven innings. On June 23, 1966, the Senators traded Duckworth and a reported $20,000 to the Kansas City Athletics for Ken Harrelson. Five weeks later, on July 30, Kansas City traded Duckworth back to Washington. Duckworth played his last major league game with Kansas City on July 24, 1966. With two hits in 59 at-bats, Duckworth had a career batting average in the major leagues of .034. He struck out 39 times. Duckworth's final season in professional baseball was in 1967, when he played for the Hawaii Islanders in the minor leagues. Personal life Duckworth and his wife Kaydee reside in Shasta County, California, and have five children.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the Leigh deanery in the archdeaconry of Salford, and diocese of Manchester. Together with St George's and St Philip's Churches in Atherton and St Michael and All Angels at Howe Bridge, the church is part of the United Benefice of Atherton and Hindsford with Howe Bridge. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History There have been three chapels or churches on the site of St John the Baptist parish church. The first chapel at Chowbent was built in 1645 by John Atherton as a chapel of ease of Leigh Parish Church. It was sometimes referred to as the Old Bent Chapel. It was not consecrated and used by the Presbyterians as well as the Vicar of Leigh. In 1721 Lord of the manor Richard Atherton expelled the dissenters who subsequently built Chowbent Chapel. The first chapel was consecrated in 1723 by the Bishop of Sodor and Man. The first chapel was replaced by a new St John's Chapel on the same site which was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester in 1814. It was in turn replaced by the present church, designed by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. It was built in two phases. The chancel and first three bays of the nave were built in 1878‚Äì79, and consecrated in 1879. The cost was ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), of which ¬£3,200 was given by the colliery owners Fletcher, Burrows and Company. The west end, which included a modified version of the southwest tower high, was completed between 1890 and 1896 by the successors in the Lancaster practice, Paley, Austin and Paley. From 1899 the church was affected by mining subsidence, causing the tower to separate from the south aisle. The tower has been stabilised, but remains out of alignment and is leaning. In 1991 the east end of the church was badly damaged by fire. It was repaired and re-ordered by Peter Skinner in 1996‚Äì97; the re-ordering included dividing the chancel from the rest of the church to create a church hall. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in Runcorn sandstone with ashlar dressings and a tiled roof. Its architectural style is that of the late Decorated period. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel with a north chapel and a south two- storey vestry and organ chamber, and a southwest tower. The tower is in five stages with octagonal buttresses at each corner, which rise above the parapet to form turrets with conical caps. The parapet is embattled. The doorway is on the south side of the tower, and above it is a four-light window. There are clock faces in the fourth stage, and the bell openings in the top stage have four lights. Above each bell opening is a statue in a canopied niche. On the south side of the church the windows have four lights, while those on the north side have three lights. Along the clerestory are square windows, two to a bay, which contain two different types of tracery. To the east of the vestry and organ chamber is an octagonal turret. The west and east windows are large, the west window having seven lights, and the east window six. Under the east window is red and buff chequerwork carved with roses, the IHC christogram, leaves and swords. The hour-chiming clock was installed by Potts of Leeds in 1895. =Interior= The font The interior is in Stourton stone with a Yorkshire stone floor. The nave has a hammerbeam roof. The arcades are carried on clustered piers. The former intricately carved chancel screen now acts as a reredos behind the altar at the east end of the nave. The stone pulpit, which contains marble panels with niches depicting scenes from the life of Christ in semi-relief, is a memorial to the Rt Revd James Fraser, Bishop of Manchester, who died in 1885. The octagonal font is in alabaster and is decorated with panels. Box pews, one of which is dated 1728, have been re-used as dado panelling in the vestry. In the nave are lamps designed by Peter Skinner. The stained glass in the east window, dated 1896, is by C. E. Kempe, and a window in the south aisle contains glass by Ward and Hughes dating from 1895. In another south aisle window is glass from 1922 by Edward Moore, which has been moved from the north chapel. The rest of the windows have been re-glazed after the 1991 fire with clear glass. The two-manual pipe organ was built in 1967 by Hill, Norman and Beard, replacing an earlier three-manual organ of 1888 by J. C. Bishop and Son. =Appraisal= The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 15 July 1966. Grade II is the lowest of the three gradings given by English Heritage, and includes buildings that \\"are nationally important and of special interest\\". The description in the National Heritage List for England states that it is \\"an imposing building which exhibits fine craftsmanship both inside and out\\". The authors of the Buildings of England series describe the church as \\"monumental, one of Paley & Austin's best\\", and state that the tower is \\"magnificently monumental\\". Brandwood et al. in their book on the architectural practice of Sharpe, Paley and Austin agree that it is \\"one of Paley & Austin's finest churches\\".

Work  His work has been featured in museum and gallery exhibitions such as MoMA PS1's \\"2010 Greater New York,\\" the Aspen Art Museum's \\"The Anxiety of Photography\\" in 2011, Saatchi Gallery's \\"Out of Focus\\" in 2012,Frank, Priscilla (May, 2012). \\"'Out Of Focus' Explores Contemporary Photography At Saatchi Galler\\" LACMA's \\"Lost Line\\" exhibition in 2013,\\"Lost Line: Contemporary Art from the Collection\\" LACMA.org. \\"What is a Photograph?\\" at the International Center for Photography in 2014.Johnson, Ken (2014). \\"Digital, Analog and Waterlogged\\" The New York Times Since 2011 he has presented numerous solo exhibitions at Salon 94 gallery in New York City and Moran Bondaroff gallery in Los Angeles, CA. In 2011 he was a recipient of Rema Hort Mann Foundation Visual Arts Grant. Sherry's work varies from landscape and studio photography, to collage and sculpture, often with a heavy focus on color. Working with analogue film and printing techniques \\"the use of anachronistic, primitive methods reflects a concern with craft, introducing the hand of the artist into a medium most commonly associated with mechanical reproduction.\\" Sherry's work often merges human and natural subjects, creating images in which landscapes take on anthropomorphic qualities and the humans in them become part of the landscape, as opposed to inhabitants. Sherry‚Äôs use of vibrant monochrome color began while studying for his MFA at Yale. Working closely with master printer and photographer Richard Benson, Sherry discovered that through analog printing techniques, he could manipulate color film to chromatic extremes. For Sherry, the vibrant colors he incorporates into the work are a conduit for his intense, sometimes mystical connections to the natural world. His exhibition \\"Astral Desert\\", at Salon 94 gallery in New York City explored the topography of the desert and American West through multiple processes pushing photography to a \\"chromatic extreme.\\" In the exhibitions \\"Climate Vortex Sutra\\" and \\"Paradise Fire\\" Sherry's work continued to explore themes of queer landscape, as well as climate change and its effects on the American landscape. In the series American Monuments, Sherry used his signature colored images to depict the spirit and intrinsic value of America‚Äôs threatened system of national monuments, not only conveying the beauty of these important and ecologically diverse sites, but also shedding light upon the plight of the perennially exploited landscape of the American West. In the series Paradise Fire, Sherry presented works without the signature overlaid color of his previous landscapes, opting for the natural appearance of the scene, and often depicting the interaction of humans and the environment. He has published three books of photographs, the first, titled \\"It's Time\\" in 2009 with Damiani, a second book titled \\"Quantum Light\\" released in 2012 with Damiani and Salon 94 and a third, titled \\"Earth Changes\\" released in 2015 with M√∂rel Books.

History The Owl Service originally began as a studio-based solo project for Steven Collins in June 2006. While working on the first Owl Service release (the Wake the Vaulted Echo EP from 2006) he met Dom Cooper of The Straw Bear Band who was drafted in to provide lead vocals on the song The Two Magicians. Dom remained involved with The Owl Service until March 2012 singing, writing songs, and co-ordinating the band's graphic design. The Wake the Vaulted Echo EP was warmly received in psych-folk circles and this led to Collins being asked to record a track for the 2007 compilation album John Barleycorn Reborn on the Cold Spring label (for which he also contributed sleeve notes). For the JBR album Steven recorded the traditional song The North Country Maid with session singer Rachel Davies, a song he would revisit on the debut album in an alternative version. While recording the debut Owl Service album later that year two female singers (Jo Lepine and Diana Collier) joined the band on a permanent basis. The debut album, A Garland of Song, was released on Collins' own Hobby-Horse micro-label in July 2007 as a handmade CD-r limited to 100 copies. Collins arranged, recorded and mixed the album himself at home, also providing almost all of the instrumentation - this model was how the collective operated until its demise; Collins selecting and arranging the songs, recording everything at home, and then bringing in singers and, on rare occasions, extra instrumental players to complete the tracks. Often Collins would record vocals and other parts on location if the singers/players were unable to make it to his home studio in Essex. Soon after the release of the debut album Collins opted to expand the line-up to enable them to function as a live group. It was at this time that Nancy Wallace (formerly of The Memory Band) became a permanent member of the band. By the end of 2007 Collins had signed to UK independent label Southern Records. Not an obvious label choice for a folk band, but Collins felt a certain kinship with Tony Sylvester (who handled Southern Records' A&R; at the time) as, like Collins himself, Tony was passionate about both heavy metal and the 1960s English folk revival. The other deciding factor was that two of Collins' favourite records of all time are by the Chicago band 90 Day Men who were also signed to Southern Records. Southern reissued A Garland of Song in June 2008 on CD and LP and this was followed a month later by an EP on the Static Caravan label recorded with ex-Mellow Candle singer Alison O'Donnell entitled The Fabric of Folk. By this time the band had a core line-up of 7 with the addition of Jason Steel (guitar, banjo, vocals), and experimental musician Katie English (aka Isnaj Dui) providing flute and melodica. Keen to return to his DIY roots Collins parted company with Southern Records at the end of 2009 and immediately began a series of new Owl Service releases collectively titled The Pattern Beneath the Plough. The second full-length Owls album, The View From a Hill, was released on 1 May 2010 and was the centrepiece of the Pattern series. The album featured guest appearances from Joolie Wood (of Current 93) and Alison O'Donnell among others. December 2011 saw the release of a 2 track 7\\" vinyl single comprising The Standing Stones and The Red Barn, a traditional ballad based on the Red Barn Murder and this was followed by another 7\\" release entitled There Used to be a Crown which included cover versions of 4 songs originally by Tom Rapp/Pearls Before Swine. At the start of 2012 Steven Collins put The Owl Service on an indefinite hiatus and immediately began working on two new projects; the first was Greanvine, a duo with fellow Owl Service member Diana Collier who played a mix of traditional songs and cover versions in stark, electric arrangements; the second was Country Parish Music, a project closer to the sound of The Owl Service. Collins also formed a new label, Stone Tape Recordings, named after the Nigel Kneale television play from 1972. The first 2 releases on Stone Tape Recordings were by The Owl Service; a data DVD entitled She Wants to be Flowers, But You Make Her Owls which collected mp3 files of every track the band had released at that point plus a wealth of unreleased material, artwork files, and video recordings; and the album Garland Sessions which included all 13 songs from the debut album re-mixed and partially re-recorded along with 6 additional tracks. In October 2013 Collins publicly hinted via Facebook that a new Owl Service record was in production and that the band would be making a return to the live stage in December of the same year. The December concert in Leigh-on-sea, their first live performance in over 18 months, saw Collins reunited with Jo Lepine, Diana Collier and Nancy Wallace. The band regrouped again 6 months later for 2 more shows; the first was again in Leigh-on-sea where they were joined by frequent collaborator Alison O'Donnell, and the second was in London at a fund-raising event for the feature-length Shirley Collins documentary film. October 2014 brought forth the first new Owl Service record since the Garland Sessions album in 2012; a low-key EP to mark Halloween entitled Three Inverted Nines which featured cover versions of 4 songs written by legendary musician Glenn Danzig. At the end of 2014 after 18 releases Stone Tape Recordings closed down. The reason Collins cited for the closure was the huge workload which was keeping him from recording new Owl Service material. In September 2014 another concert was announced, this time in London at an event organised by Collins to celebrate the 100th birthday of US folk song collector Alan Lomax. The concert, held the following January at Asylum in Peckham, would prove to be their last. Free from the constraints of running a label, in January 2015 Collins confirmed that the new Owl Service album, entitled His Pride. No Spear. No Friend., would be released before the end of the year. The album eventually saw the light of day on 31 October 2015 and was something of a departure from previous Owl Service releases. According to Collins; \\"The album is mostly traditional songs, but the sound is far from traditional. It's a folk album in lyrical content only, not in sound\\". Ultimately, Collins' fierce anti-industry/pro-DIY stance would prove to be his downfall as the band flew below the radar of most people and the final album was both a critical and commercial failure, being met either with total indifference or worse; completely ignored. Collins himself likened the task of promoting His Pride. No Spear. No Friend. to \\"flogging a dead horse whilst banging my head against a brick wall\\". His exasperation was compounded by the fact that he believed the album was his finest work to date, and the pinnacle of what he'd set out to achieve with The Owl Service 10 years earlier. The final record was almost entirely a one-man project, with Collins arranging, recording, mixing and mastering the audio, performing everything except the vocals, and also creating the artwork. To see the album fail proved to be the final straw and soon after the release of the album Steven Collins announced that The Owl Service would cease to exist on the band's 10th anniversary on 6 June 2016. Collins subsequently retired from making music to pursue a career in photography.

The Pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription () is a high medieval inscription impressed on clay which was created in 1119, over three hundred years before Johannes Gutenberg, by the typographic principle. The inscription plate belongs to the Pr√ºfening Abbey, a former Benedictine monastery, in Regensburg, Germany.  Description  The Latin inscription is still at its original location in Pr√ºfening Abbey, attached to one of the main pillars of its church. It reports the consecration act of the monastery in honour of St. George, carried out by the two bishops Otto of Bamberg and Hartwig of Regensburg. The inscription plate specifies the year of the act and, by implication, its own date as 1119 (‚Ä¢MCXVIIII‚Ä¢). It was made of baked clay, painted over in an alternating, red white pattern, and is approximately 26 cm wide, 41 cm high and 3 cm thick, with a crack running through its entire breadth. The sunk letterforms are the classical capitalis monumentalis or Roman square capitals. Copies are at display in several German museums, including the Gutenberg Museum at Mainz.  Typography  The unusual sharpness of the inscription letters has long led epigraphists to believe that they were not carved by hand into the clay.; The typographic character of the inscription was demonstrated in a systematic examination of the text body by the typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle.; His findings confirm that the text was produced with a printing method similar to that of the Phaistos Disc: The 17-line text was created by pressing individual, pre-formed stamps (probably made of wood) into the soft clay in a way that, for each letter which occurred more than once, the same letter stamp was re-used, thereby producing identical imprints throughout the text. Thus, the essential criterion for typographic text production was met, namely the repeated use of identical types for a single character. In applying this technique, it is not relevant that the Pr√ºfening inscription was made by stamping letters into the clay and not ‚àí as later practiced by Gutenberg ‚àí by printing on paper, since neither the technical execution nor the print medium define movable type printing, but rather the criterion of type identity: By projecting the text letters one upon the other (e.g., all \\"A\\"s onto one another) at high magnification, the consistent type identity of the dedicatory inscription could be demonstrated beyond doubt. An additional indication that its creator had worked with reusable types is the marked tendency of some letters to tilt to the right or left; in those cases the artisan apparently did not succeed in setting up the letter stamps completely parallel to the lateral borderline of the plate. The evidence of the skewed letters, but most importantly the observation that the type token criterion was met throughout the text prove the \\"typographic character of the Pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription with certainty.\\": A fragment of another inscription plate found close to the monastery indicates that the Pr√ºfening abbey inscription did not remain an isolated phenomenon, but that at least locally the typographic production method was applied more frequently. = Further medieval techniques = In the cathedral of Cividale, the silver altarpiece of Pellegrino II, the patriarch of Aquileia between 1195 and 1204, was inscribed in Latin by the means of individual letter punches (instead of stamps).; ; Apart from stamping and punching, another typographic method existed which followed the scrabble principle: for decorating the paved floors of monasteries and churches, individual letter tiles were burnt and then so assembled that they formed Christian inscriptions on the floor.

It can be as simple as an echo command to print the value of a variable at certain points of a program. Modern integrated development environments sometimes render this unnecessary by allowing the placement of stop points at specific places in the program, and providing the ability to view the value of variables through the IDE rather than program output. Uses of debug code Debug code's main function is to help debug code. This can do this in several ways, such as using print statements, assert commands and unit testing. =Use in coding= Small statements can be added to code in order to find the presence and the location of bugs within a program. It can also be used to provide test inputs to simulate possible use cases that a program might need to be able to accept. It can also be used as a place holder for code that is still in development. =Use in video games= Many video gaming mod, cheat codes, such as level cheat code, invincibility, etc. were originally introduced as debug code to allow the programmers and/or testers to skip hindrances that would prevent them from rapidly getting to parts of the game that needed to be tested; and in these cases cheat modes are often referred to as debugging mode. It is recommended as a best practice that debugging code be removed from production versions of applications, as it can slow them down. However some games leave these commands and cheats available for the players to use as a way to enhance their play experience. For example, the PC version of Skyrim allows the player access to the command console, giving them the ability to modify certain aspects of their game as it is being run. These commands include giving the player invincibility, teleportation and unlimited gold.http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/16/skyrim-console-commands-let-you-cheat- and-do-other-stuff/ Examples of debug code =Print debugging= Print debugging is making use of print statements in order to find and isolate bugs in a program. It can be used to track the flow of data values of a piece of code. This type of debug code has some distinct disadvantages. It is temporary and usually removed when the bug is solved. The use of many print statements can affect the actual output of a program and slow down the run-time, depending on how often print statements are called. In some cases print statements do not help find the problem, for example the C++ stdout has a buffered output, and sometimes the contents of the buffer are lost leading to incorrect debugging information.http://oopweb.com/CPP/Documents/DebugCPP/Volume/techniques.html C++ example void TestFunction(int timesToRun) { cout << \\"the algorithm should run \\" << timesToRun << \\" times\\" << std::endl; for (int i = 0; i <= timesToRun; i++) { // run algorithm algorithm(); // debug print statement cout << \\"algorithm run \\" << i++ << \\" times.\\" << std::endl; } } There is a bug in the above code. On an input of 5 the program should print the following to the console. the algorithm should run 5 times algorithm run 1 times. algorithm run 2 times. algorithm run 3 times. algorithm run 4 times. algorithm run 5 times. The actual output is the following, which is incorrect. the algorithm should run 5 times algorithm run 1 times. algorithm run 2 times. algorithm run 3 times. algorithm run 4 times. algorithm run 5 times. algorithm run 6 times. Our function is running through the algorithm an extra time, and upon closer inspection it is clear that our loop is coded wrong. =Assert statements= Usually the best time to fix a bug is before the program is run. This can be done by inserting assertions into the code. In C this can be done using the assert() command. An assert command can check to see if the program is running the correct conditions at this point in the program.http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~jamie/C/Debug/UGCS_CS2_debugging_notes.html C example int i, a[10]; for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { a[i] = 10-i; } for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { a[a[i = a[i]; } The above code will cause has an out of bounds error which can lead to some unexpected results. The code can be written in a safer way, using assertions, as shown below. #include int i, a[10]; for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { assert(0 <= i && i < 10); a[i] = 10-i; } for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { assert(0 <= i && i < 10); assert(0 <= a[i] && a[i] < 10); a[a[i = a[i]; } =JUnit= JUnit is a simple framework used to write repeatable test available for java, and allows programmers to create their own unit test. A unit test is code that is written to execute a specific function in the code to be tested and usually targets a small unit of code, such a single method or class. Using a combination of assert statements and other test statements, programmers can create suites of test cases in order to tell if a method or function is being executed properly.http://junit.org/ References Category:Software maintenance ","title":"Debug code"},{"id":"26707383","text":"Our World is the third studio album from dancehall/reggae fusion group T.O.K., released in 2009.

His father was a teacher and his mother worked at an accounting firm. After graduating from Marshall Senior High School in 1985, Meffert earned his Bachelor of Arts at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota where he was president of the College Republicans. He majored in political science, and also played percussion in the St. Olaf Band and Jazz Band. That is where he met his future wife, Karrin, who played clarinet. Karrin and Meffert married in 1991. In 1992, they moved to Chicago so Karrin could attend graduate school at Northwestern University. In Chicago, Meffert worked for the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons on such issues as coverage for reconstruction after mastectomy and cleft lip and palate repair. He also worked to ensure that access to burn care and reconstructive surgery was included in the Clinton Health Plan proposals. Meffert later went on to work at the American Medical Association. Meffert and his wife returned to Edina, Minnesota to raise their three children. Alex, Noah, and Katy all attend Edina Public Schools. Both Meffert and his wife served as Co-Presidents of the Parent Teacher Association at their children's elementary school and he then served on the Minnesota State PTA board, where he served as president.

The unifying principle is that the free energy of a system at equilibrium is the minimum possible, so that the slope of the free energy with respect to the reaction coordinate is zero. This principle, applied to mixtures at equilibrium provides a definition of an equilibrium constant. Applications include acid‚Äìbase, host‚Äìguest, metal‚Äìcomplex, solubility, partition, chromatography and redox equilibria.  Thermodynamic equilibrium  A chemical system is said to be in equilibrium when the quantities of the chemical entities involved do not and cannot change in time without the application of an external influence. In this sense a system in chemical equilibrium is in a stable state. The system at chemical equilibrium will be at a constant temperature, pressure (or volume) and composition. It will be insulated from exchange of heat with the surroundings, that is, it is a closed system. A change of temperature, pressure (or volume) constitutes an external influence and the equilibrium quantities will change as a result of such a change. If there is a possibility that the composition might change, but the rate of change is negligibly slow, the system is said to be in a metastable state. The equation of chemical equilibrium can be expressed symbolically as :reactant(s) product(s) The sign means \\"are in equilibrium with\\". This definition refers to macroscopic properties. Changes do occur at the microscopic level of atoms and molecules, but to such a minute extent that they are not measurable and in a balanced way so that the macroscopic quantities do not change. Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic state in which forward and backward reactions proceed at such rates that the macroscopic composition of the mixture is constant. Thus, equilibrium sign symbolizes the fact that reactions occur in both forward \\\\rightharpoonup and backward \\\\leftharpoondown directions. right A steady state, on the other hand, is not necessarily an equilibrium state in the chemical sense. For example, in a radioactive decay chain the concentrations of intermediate isotopes are constant because the rate of production is equal to the rate of decay. It is not a chemical equilibrium because the decay process occurs in one direction only. Thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized by the free energy for the whole (closed) system being a minimum. For systems at constant volume the Helmholtz free energy is minimum and for systems at constant pressure the Gibbs free energy is minimum.Denbigh, Chapter 4 Thus a metastable state is one for which the free energy change between reactants and products is not minimal even though the composition does not change in time.Denbigh, Chapter 5 The existence of this minimum is due to the free energy of mixing of reactants and products being always negative.Atkins, p. 203 For ideal solutions the enthalpy of mixing is zero, so the minimum exists because the entropy of mixing is always positive.Atkins, p. 149 The slope of the reaction free energy, Œ¥Gr with respect to the reaction coordinate, Œæ, is zero when the free energy is at its minimum value. :\\\\delta G_\\\\mathrm{r}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial \\\\xi }\\\\right)_{T,P};\\\\quad \\\\delta G_\\\\mathrm{r}(\\\\mathrm{Eq})=0  Equilibrium constant  Chemical potential is the partial molar free energy. The potential, Œºi, of the ith species in a chemical reaction is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the number of moles of that species, Ni: :\\\\mu_i=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial N_i}\\\\right)_{T,P} A general chemical equilibrium can be written asThe general expression is not used much in chemistry. To help understand the notation consider the equilibrium :H2SO4 \\\\+ 2 OH‚àí \\\\+ 2 H2O for this reaction , , and , Reactant1 = H2SO4, Reactant2 = OH‚àí, Product1 = and Product2 = H2O. :\\\\sum_j n_j \\\\mathrm{Reactant}_j\\\\rightleftharpoons \\\\sum_k m_k \\\\mathrm{Product}_k nj are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in the equilibrium equation, and mj are the coefficients of the products. The value of Œ¥Gr for these reactions is a function of the chemical potentials of all the species. :\\\\delta G_\\\\mathrm{r} = \\\\sum_k m_k \\\\mu_k \\\\, - \\\\sum_j n_j \\\\mu_j The chemical potential, Œºi, of the ith species can be calculated in terms of its activity, ai. :\\\\mu_i = \\\\mu_i^\\\\ominus + RT \\\\ln a_i Œº is the standard chemical potential of the species, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. Setting the sum for the reactants j to be equal to the sum for the products, k, so that Œ¥Gr(Eq) = 0: :\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\left(\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus +RT\\\\ln a_j\\\\right)=\\\\sum_k m_k\\\\left(\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus +RT\\\\ln a_k\\\\right) Rearranging the terms, :\\\\sum_k m_k\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus-\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus =-RT \\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\ln {a_k}^{m_k}-\\\\sum_j \\\\ln {a_j}^{n_j}\\\\right) :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = -RT \\\\ln K. This relates the standard Gibbs free energy change, ŒîG ~~o~~ to an equilibrium constant, K, the reaction quotient of activity values at equilibrium. :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = \\\\sum_k m_k\\\\mu_k^\\\\ominus-\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\mu_j^\\\\ominus :\\\\ln K= \\\\sum_k \\\\ln {a_k}^{m_k}-\\\\sum_j \\\\ln {a_j}^{n_j}; \\\\quad K=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k {a_k}^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j {a_j}^{n_j}} It follows that any equilibrium of this kind can be characterized either by the standard free energy change or by the equilibrium constant. In practice concentrations are more useful than activities. Activities can be calculated from concentrations if the activity coefficient are known, but this is rarely the case. Sometimes activity coefficients can be calculated using, for example, Pitzer equations or Specific ion interaction theory. Otherwise conditions must be adjusted so that activity coefficients do not vary much. For ionic solutions this is achieved by using a background ionic medium at a high concentration relative to the concentrations of the species in equilibrium. If activity coefficients are unknown they may be subsumed into the equilibrium constant, which becomes a concentration quotient. Chapter 2, Activity and concentration quotients Each activity ai is assumed to be the product of a concentration, [Ai], and an activity coefficient, Œ≥i: :a_i=[\\\\mathrm{A}_i]\\\\gamma_i This expression for activity is placed in the expression defining the equilibrium constant.Atkins, p. 208 :K=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k {a_k}^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j {a_j}^{n_j}} =\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k \\\\left([\\\\mathrm{A}_k]\\\\gamma_k\\\\right)^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j \\\\left([\\\\mathrm{A}_j]\\\\gamma_j\\\\right)^{n_j}} =\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k [\\\\mathrm{A}_k]^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j [\\\\mathrm{A}_j]^{n_j}}\\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\prod_k {\\\\gamma_k}^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j {\\\\gamma_j}^{n_j}} =\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k [\\\\mathrm{A}_k]^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j [\\\\mathrm{A}_j]^{n_j}}\\\\times \\\\Gamma By setting the quotient of activity coefficients, Œì, equal to one,This is equivalent to defining a new equilibrium constant as the equilibrium constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations. :K=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_k [\\\\mathrm{A}_k]^{m_k}}{\\\\prod_j [\\\\mathrm{A}_j]^{n_j}} In more familiar notation, for a general equilibrium :Œ± A + Œ≤ B ... œÉ S + œÑ T ... :K=\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{S}]^\\\\sigma [\\\\mathrm{T}]^\\\\tau ... } {[\\\\mathrm{A}]^\\\\alpha [\\\\mathrm{B}]^\\\\beta ...} This definition is much more practical, but an equilibrium constant defined in terms of concentrations is dependent on conditions. In particular, equilibrium constants for species in aqueous solution are dependent on ionic strength, as the quotient of activity coefficients varies with the ionic strength of the solution. The values of the standard free energy change and of the equilibrium constant are temperature dependent. To a first approximation, the van 't Hoff equation may be used. : \\\\frac{d \\\\ln K}{dT}\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{RT^2} \\\\quad\\\\mbox{ or }\\\\quad \\\\frac{d \\\\ln K}{d\\\\tfrac{1}{T}}\\\\ = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{R} This shows that when the reaction is exothermic (ŒîH ~~o~~ , the standard enthalpy change, is negative), then K decreases with increasing temperature, in accordance with Le Ch√¢telier's principle. The approximation involved is that the standard enthalpy change, ŒîH ~~o~~ , is independent of temperature, which is a good approximation only over a small temperature range. Thermodynamic arguments can be used to show that :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial T} \\\\right)_p=C_p where Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure. = Equilibria involving gases = When dealing with gases, fugacity, f, is used rather than activity. However, whereas activity is dimensionless, fugacity has the dimension of pressure. A consequence is that chemical potential has to be defined in terms of a standard pressure, p ~~o~~ :Atkins, p. 111 :\\\\mu=\\\\mu^\\\\ominus +RT \\\\ln \\\\frac{f}{p^\\\\ominus} By convention p ~~o~~ is usually taken to be 1 bar. Fugacity can be expressed as the product of partial pressure, p, and a fugacity coefficient, Œ¶: :f=p\\\\Phi Fugacity coefficients are dimensionless and can be obtained experimentally at specific temperature and pressure, from measurements of deviations from ideal gas behaviour. Equilibrium constants are defined in terms of fugacity. If the gases are at sufficiently low pressure that they behave as ideal gases, the equilibrium constant can be defined as a quotient of partial pressures. An example of gas-phase equilibrium is provided by the Haber‚ÄìBosch process of ammonia synthesis. :N2 \\\\+ 3 H2 2 NH3;K=\\\\frac{{f_{\\\\mathrm{NH_3}}}^2}{f_{\\\\mathrm{N_2}}{f_{\\\\mathrm{H_2}}}^3} This reaction is strongly exothermic, so the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature. However, a temperature of around 400 ¬∞C is required in order to achieve a reasonable rate of reaction with currently available catalysts. Formation of ammonia is also favoured by high pressure, as the volume decreases when the reaction takes place. The same reaction, nitrogen fixation, occurs at ambient temperatures in nature, when the catalyst is an enzyme such as nitrogenase. Much energy is needed initially to break the nitrogen‚Äìnitrogen triple bond even though the overall reaction is exothermic. Gas-phase equilibria occur during combustion and were studied as early as 1943 in connection with the development of the V2 rocket engine. The calculation of composition for a gaseous equilibrium at constant pressure is often carried out using ŒîG values, rather than equilibrium constants. = Multiple equilibria = Two or more equilibria can exist at the same time. When this is so, equilibrium constants can be ascribed to individual equilibria, but they are not always unique. For example, three equilibrium constants can be defined for a dibasic acid, H2A.The definitions given are association constants. A dissociation constant is the reciprocal of an association constant. :A2‚àí \\\\+ H+ HA‚àí; K_1=\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{HA-}]}{[\\\\ce{H+}][\\\\ce{A^2-}]} :HA‚àí \\\\+ H+ H2A; K_2=\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{H2A}]}{[\\\\ce{H+}][\\\\ce{HA-}]} :A2‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ H2A; \\\\beta_2=\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{H2A}]}{[\\\\ce{H+}]^2[\\\\ce{A^2-}]} The three constants are not independent of each other and it is easy to see that . The constants K1 and K2 are stepwise constants and Œ≤ is an example of an overall constant. = Speciation = Speciation diagram for a solution of citric acid as a function of pH. The concentrations of species in equilibrium are usually calculated under the assumption that activity coefficients are either known or can be ignored. In this case, each equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex in a set of multiple equilibria can be defined as follows :Œ± A + Œ≤ B ... AŒ±BŒ≤...; K_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\ldots}=\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{A}_\\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{B}_\\\\beta \\\\ldots]} {[\\\\mathrm{A}]^\\\\alpha [\\\\mathrm{B}]^\\\\beta \\\\ldots} The concentrations of species containing reagent A are constrained by a condition of mass-balance, that is, the total (or analytical) concentration, which is the sum of all species' concentrations, must be constant. There is one mass-balance equation for each reagent of the type :T_\\\\mathrm{A} = [\\\\mathrm{A}] +\\\\sum [\\\\mathrm{A}_\\\\alpha \\\\mathrm{B}_\\\\beta \\\\ldots]= [\\\\mathrm{A}] +\\\\sum \\\\left(\\\\alpha K_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}\\\\ldots[\\\\mathrm{A}]^\\\\alpha [\\\\mathrm{B}]^\\\\beta \\\\ldots\\\\right) There are as many mass-balance equations as there are reagents, A, B..., so if the equilibrium constant values are known, there are n mass-balance equations in n unknowns, [A], [B]..., the so-called free reagent concentrations. Solution of these equations gives all the information needed to calculate the concentrations of all the species. Thus, the importance of an equilibrium constants lies in the fact that, once their values have been determined by experiment, they can be used to calculate the concentrations, known as the speciation, of mixtures that contain the relevant species. = Determination = There are five main types of experimental data that are used for the determination of solution equilibrium constants. Potentiometric data obtained with a glass electrode are the most widely used with aqueous solutions. The others are Spectrophotometric, Fluorescence (luminescence) measurements and NMR chemical shift measurements; simultaneous measurement of K and ŒîH for 1:1 adducts in biological systems is routinely carried out using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The experimental data will comprise a set of data points. At the i'th data point, the analytical concentrations of the reactants, TA(i), TB(i) etc. will be experimentally known quantities and there will be one or more measured quantities, yi, that depend in some way on the analytical concentrations and equilibrium constants. A general computational procedure has three main components. # Definition of a chemical model of the equilibria. The model consists of a list of reagents, A, B, etc. and the complexes formed from them, with stoichiometries ApBq... Known or estimated values of the equilibrium constants for the formation of all complexes must be supplied. # Calculation of the concentrations of all the chemical species in each solution. The free concentrations are calculated by solving the equations of mass-balance, and the concentrations of the complexes are calculated using the equilibrium constant definitions. A quantity corresponding to the observed quantity can then be calculated using physical principles such as the Nernst potential or Beer-Lambert law which relate the calculated quantity to the concentrations of the species. # Refinement of the equilibrium constants. Usually a Non-linear least squares procedure is used. A weighted sum of squares, U, is minimized. :::U=\\\\sum^{i=1}_{i=np} w_i\\\\left(y_i^\\\\mathrm{observed} - y_i^\\\\mathrm{calculated}\\\\right)^2 ::The weights, wi and quantities y may be vectors. Values of the equilibrium constants are refined in an iterative procedure.  Acid‚Äìbase equilibria  Br√∏nsted and Lowry characterized an acid‚Äìbase equilibrium as involving a proton exchange reaction: Includes discussion of many organic Br√∏nsted acids. Chapter 5: Acids and Bases Chapter 6: Acids, Bases and Ions in Aqueous Solution :acid + base conjugate base + conjugate acid. An acid is a proton donor; the proton is transferred to the base, a proton acceptor, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is A‚àí and the conjugate acid is the solvated hydrogen ion. In solution chemistry, it is usual to use H+ as an abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen ion, regardless of the solvent. In aqueous solution H+ denotes a solvated hydronium ion.The bare proton does not exist in aqueous solution. It is a very strong acid and combines the base, water, to form the hydronium ion :H+ \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí H3O+ The hydronium ion forms various weak complexes by hydrogen bonding with more water molecules. The Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition applies to other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide: the solvent S acts as a base, accepting a proton and forming the conjugate acid SH+. A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis, in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid, B(OH)3, , acts as a weak acid, even though it is not a proton donor, because of the hydrolysis equilibrium : + + H+. Similarly, metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such as to behave as weak acids: Section 9.1 \\"Acidity of Solvated Cations\\" lists many pKa values. : + . Acid‚Äìbase equilibria are important in a very wide range of applications, such as acid‚Äìbase homeostasis, ocean acidification, pharmacology and analytical chemistry. Host‚Äìguest equilibria A host‚Äìguest complex, also known as a donor‚Äìacceptor complex, may be formed from a Lewis base, B, and a Lewis acid, A. The host may be either a donor or an acceptor. In biochemistry host‚Äìguest complexes are known as receptor-ligand complexes; they are formed primarily by non-covalent bonding. Many host‚Äìguest complexes has 1:1 stoichiometry, but many others have more complex structures. The general equilibrium can be written as :p A + q B ApBq The study of these complexes is important for supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition. The objective of these studies is often to find systems with a high binding selectivity of a host (receptor) for a particular target molecule or ion, the guest or ligand. An application is the development of chemical sensors. Finding a drug which either blocks a receptor, an antagonist which forms a strong complex the receptor, or activate it, an agonist, is an important pathway to drug discovery.  Complexes of metals  Speciation diagram for aluminium in aqueous solution as a function of pH. A variety of hydroxo complexes are formed, including aluminium hydroxide, (Al(OH)3(s), which is insoluble at pH ~6.5 The formation of a complex between a metal ion, M, and a ligand, L, is in fact usually a substitution reaction. For example, In aqueous solutions, metal ions will be present as aquo ions, so the reaction for the formation of the first complex could be written asElectrical charges are omitted from such expressions because the ligand, L, may or may not carry an electrical charge. :[M(H2O)n] + L [M(H2O)n‚àí1L] + H2O However, since water is in vast excess, the concentration of water is usually assumed to be constant and is omitted from equilibrium constant expressions. Often, the metal and the ligand are in competition for protons. For the equilibrium :p M + q L + r H MpLqHr a stability constant can be defined as follows: Section 2.2, Types of complex equilibrium constants :\\\\beta_{pqr}=\\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{M}_p\\\\mathrm{L}_q\\\\mathrm{H}_r] } {[\\\\mathrm{M}]^p [\\\\mathrm{L}]^q [\\\\mathrm{H}]^r} The definition can easily be extended to include any number of reagents. It includes hydroxide complexes because the concentration of the hydroxide ions is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by the self-ionization of water :[\\\\ce{OH-}] = \\\\frac{K_\\\\mathrm{w} }{ [\\\\ce{H+}]} Stability constants defined in this way, are association constants. This can lead to some confusion as pKa values are dissociation constants. In general purpose computer programs it is customary to define all constants as association constants. The relationship between the two types of constant is given in association and dissociation constants. In biochemistry, an oxygen molecule can bind to an iron(II) atom in a heme prosthetic group in hemoglobin. The equilibrium is usually written, denoting hemoglobin by Hb, as : Hb + O2 HbO2 but this representation is incomplete as the Bohr effect shows that the equilibrium concentrations are pH-dependent. A better representation would be : [HbH]+ \\\\+ O2 HbO2 \\\\+ H+ as this shows that when hydrogen ion concentration increases the equilibrium is shifted to the left in accordance with Le Ch√¢telier's principle. Hydrogen ion concentration can be increased by the presence of carbon dioxide, which behaves as a weak acid. :H2O + CO2 \\\\+ H+ The iron atom can also bind to other molecules such as carbon monoxide. Cigarette smoke contains some carbon monoxide so the equilibrium :HbO2 \\\\+ CO + O2 is established in the blood of cigarette smokers. Chelation therapy is based on the principle of using chelating ligands with a high binding selectivity for a particular metal to remove that metal from the human body. Complexes with polyamino carboxylic acids find a wide range of applications. EDTA in particular is used extensively.  Redox equilibria  A reduction‚Äìoxidation (redox) equilibrium can be handled in exactly the same way as any other chemical equilibrium. For example, :Fe2+ \\\\+ Ce4+ Fe3+ \\\\+ Ce3+;K=\\\\frac{[\\\\ce{Fe^3+}][\\\\ce{Ce^3+}]}{[\\\\ce{Fe^2+}][\\\\ce{Ce^4+}]} However, in the case of redox reactions it is convenient to split the overall reaction into two half-reactions. In this example :Fe3+ \\\\+ e‚àí Fe2+ :Ce4+ \\\\+ e‚àí Ce3+ The standard free energy change, which is related to the equilibrium constant by :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus=-RT \\\\ln K\\\\, can be split into two components, :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus=\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus_\\\\ce{Fe}+\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus_\\\\ce{Ce} The concentration of free electrons is effectively zero as the electrons are transferred directly from the reductant to the oxidant. The standard electrode potential, E0 for the each half-reaction is related to the standard free energy change byAtkins, Chapter 7, section \\"Equilibrium electrochemistry\\" :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus_\\\\ce{Fe} = -nFE^0_\\\\ce{Fe};\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus_\\\\ce{Ce} = -nFE^0_\\\\ce{Ce} where n is the number of electrons transferred and F is the Faraday constant. Now, the free energy for an actual reaction is given by :\\\\Delta G=\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus +RT \\\\ln Q where R is the gas constant and Q a reaction quotient. Strictly speaking Q is a quotient of activities, but it is common practice to use concentrations instead of activities. Therefore: :E_\\\\ce{Fe}=E_\\\\ce{Fe}^0 + \\\\frac{RT}{nF} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\ce{Fe^3+}]}{[\\\\ce{Fe^2+}]} For any half-reaction, the redox potential of an actual mixture is given by the generalized expressionThe alternative expression :E=E^0 - \\\\frac{RT}{nF} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\text{reduced species}]}{[\\\\text{oxidized species}]} is sometimes used, as in the Nernst equation. :E=E^0 + \\\\frac{RT}{nF} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[\\\\text{oxidized species}]}{[\\\\text{reduced species}]} This is an example of the Nernst equation. The potential is known as a reduction potential. Standard electrode potentials are available in a table of values. Using these values, the actual electrode potential for a redox couple can be calculated as a function of the ratio of concentrations. The equilibrium potential for a general redox half- reaction (See #Equilibrium constant above for an explanation of the symbols) :Œ± A + Œ≤ B... + n e‚àí œÉ S + œÑ T... is given byMendham, pp. 59‚Äì64 :E=E^\\\\ominus + \\\\frac{RT}{nF}\\\\ln\\\\frac{{\\\\\\\\{\\\\ce{S}\\\\\\\\}} ^\\\\sigma {\\\\\\\\{\\\\ce{T}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\tau ... } {{\\\\\\\\{\\\\ce{A}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\alpha {\\\\\\\\{\\\\ce{B}\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\beta ...} Use of this expression allows the effect of a species not involved in the redox reaction, such as the hydrogen ion in a half-reaction such as : + 8 H+ \\\\+ 5 e‚àí Mn2+ \\\\+ 4 H2O to be taken into account. The equilibrium constant for a full redox reaction can be obtained from the standard redox potentials of the constituent half-reactions. At equilibrium the potential for the two half-reactions must be equal to each other and, of course, the number of electrons exchanged must be the same in the two half reactions.Mendham, section 2.33, p. 63 for details Redox equilibria play an important role in the electron transport chain. The various cytochromes in the chain have different standard redox potentials, each one adapted for a specific redox reaction. This allows, for example, atmospheric oxygen to be reduced in photosynthesis. A distinct family of cytochromes, the cytochrome P450 oxidases, are involved in steroidogenesis and detoxification.  Solubility  When a solute forms a saturated solution in a solvent, the concentration of the solute, at a given temperature, is determined by the equilibrium constant at that temperature. :\\\\ln K=-RT \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sum_k {a_k}^{m_k} \\\\mathrm{(solution)}}{a \\\\mathrm{(solid)}}\\\\right) The activity of a pure substance in the solid state is one, by definition, so the expression simplifies to :\\\\ln K=-RT \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\sum_k {a_k}^{m_k} \\\\mathrm{(solution)}\\\\right) If the solute does not dissociate the summation is replaced by a single term, but if dissociation occurs, as with ionic substances :K_\\\\mathrm{SP}=\\\\prod_k{{a_k}^{m_k}} For example, with Na2SO4, and so the solubility product is written as :K_\\\\mathrm{SP}=[\\\\mathrm{Na^+}]^2[\\\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}] Concentrations, indicated by [...], are usually used in place of activities, but activity must be taken into account of the presence of another salt with no ions in common, the so- called salt effect. When another salt is present that has an ion in common, the common-ion effect comes into play, reducing the solubility of the primary solute.Mendham, pp. 37‚Äì45 Partition When a solution of a substance in one solvent is brought into equilibrium with a second solvent that is immiscible with the first solvent, the dissolved substance may be partitioned between the two solvents. The ratio of concentrations in the two solvents is known as a partition coefficient or distribution coefficient.The distinction between a partition coefficient and a distribution coefficient is of historical significance only. The partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of the analytical concentrations of the solute in the two phases. By convention the value is reported in logarithmic form. : \\\\log p = \\\\log \\\\frac{[\\\\mathrm{solute}]_\\\\mathrm{organic\\\\; phase}}{[\\\\mathrm{solute}]_\\\\mathrm{aqueous\\\\; phase}} The partition coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients are very important in pharmacology because they determine the extent to which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents, yielding the so- called octanol-water partition coefficient. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH 7‚Äì7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. log p is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium. An organic MTBE solution is extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. This base removes benzoic acid as benzoate but leaves non-acidic benzil (yellow) behind in the upper organic phase. Solvent extraction is used extensively in separation and purification processes. In its simplest form a reaction is performed in an organic solvent and unwanted by-products are removed by extraction into water at a particular pH. A metal ion may be extracted from an aqueous phase into an organic phase in which the salt is not soluble, by adding a ligand. The ligand, La‚àí, forms a complex with the metal ion, Mb+, [MLx](b‚àíax)+ which has a strongly hydrophobic outer surface. If the complex has no electrical charge it will be extracted relatively easily into the organic phase. If the complex is charged, it is extracted as an ion pair. The additional ligand is not always required. For example, uranyl nitrate, UO2(NO3)2, is soluble in diethyl ether because the solvent itself acts as a ligand. This property was used in the past for separating uranium from other metals whose salts are not soluble in ether. Currently extraction into kerosene is preferred, using a ligand such as tri-n- butyl phosphate, TBP. In the PUREX process, which is commonly used in nuclear reprocessing, uranium(VI) is extracted from strong nitric acid as the electrically neutral complex [UO2(TBP)2(NO3)2]. The strong nitric acid provides a high concentration of nitrate ions which pushes the equilibrium in favour of the weak nitrato complex. Uranium is recovered by back-extraction (stripping) into weak nitric acid. Plutonium(IV) forms a similar complex, [PuO2(TBP)2(NO3)2] and the plutonium in this complex can be reduced to separate it from uranium. Another important application of solvent extraction is in the separation of the lanthanoids. This process also uses TBP and the complexes are extracted into kerosene. Separation is achieved because the stability constant for the formation of the TBP complex increases as the size of the lanthanoid ion decreases. An instance of ion-pair extraction is in the use of a ligand to enable oxidation by potassium permanganate, KMnO4, in an organic solvent. KMnO4 is not soluble in organic solvents. When a ligand, such as a crown ether is added to an aqueous solution of KMnO4, it forms a hydrophobic complex with the potassium cation which allows the uncharged ion pair [KL]+[MnO4]‚àí to be extracted into the organic solvent. See also: phase- transfer catalysis. More complex partitioning problems (i.e. 3 or more phases present) can sometimes be handled with a fugacity capacity approach.  Chromatography  In chromatography substances are separated by partition between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The analyte is dissolved in the mobile phase, and passes over the stationary phase. Separation occurs because of differing affinities of the analytes for the stationary phase. A distribution constant, Kd can be defined as :K_\\\\mathrm{d}=\\\\frac{a_\\\\mathrm{s}}{a_\\\\mathrm{m}} where as and am are the equilibrium activities in the stationary and mobile phases respectively. It can be shown that the rate of migration, , is related to the distribution constant by :\\\\bar{ u} \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{1+fK_\\\\mathrm{d}}. f is a factor which depends on the volumes of the two phases. Section 30E, Chromatographic separations Thus, the higher the affinity of the solute for the stationary phase, the slower the migration rate. There is a wide variety of chromatographic techniques, depending on the nature of the stationary and mobile phases. When the stationary phase is solid, the analyte may form a complex with it. A water softener functions by selective complexation with a sulfonate ion exchange resin. Sodium ions form relatively weak complexes with the resin. When hard water is passed through the resin, the divalent ions of magnesium and calcium displace the sodium ions and are retained on the resin, R. : RNa + M2+ RM+ \\\\+ Na+ The water coming out of the column is relatively rich in sodium ionsFeeding babies formula made up with sodium rich water can lead to hypernatremia. and poor in calcium and magnesium which are retained on the column. The column is regenerated by passing a strong solution of sodium chloride through it, so that the resin‚Äìsodium complex is again formed on the column. Ion-exchange chromatography utilizes a resin such as chelex 100 in which iminodiacetate residues, attached to a polymer backbone, form chelate complexes of differing strengths with different metal ions, allowing the ions such as Cu2+ and Ni2+ to be separated chromatographically. Another example of complex formation is in chiral chromatography in which is used to separate enantiomers from each other. The stationary phase is itself chiral and forms complexes selectively with the enantiomers. In other types of chromatography with a solid stationary phase, such as thin layer chromatography the analyte is selectively adsorbed onto the solid. In gas‚Äìliquid chromatography (GLC) the stationary phase is a liquid such as polydimethylsiloxane, coated on a glass tube. Separation is achieved because the various components in the gas have different solubility in the stationary phase. GLC can be used to separate literally hundreds of components in a gas mixture such as cigarette smoke or essential oils, such as lavender oil.

It is the twentieth episode of the show's sixth season and was aired on April 25, 2010. Plot The Fairview strangler is revealed as Danny's friend, Eddie (Josh Zuckerman). He has been living among the women of Wisteria Lane since childhood: He once caught Gaby (Eva Longoria) and Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) during an intimate moment as a child after spending time with her as they were both lonely; Bree (Marcia Cross) offered him a job and some dating advice when he was younger, until she found out that he had a crush on her daughter, Danielle (Joy Lauren); Susan (Teri Hatcher) encouraged his passion for art, and eventually pays for an art seminar for him; and Lynette (Felicity Huffman) will show him some kindness and generosity. Eddie is shown at the beginning of the episode offering to buy his alcoholic mother (Diane Farr) more alcohol when he goes out; making a point of telling her to stay out of his room. Once he leaves, she goes against his wishes and kicks in his door. Instead of finding the alcohol she believes hidden in his room, she finds the scrapbook he keeps of his victims under his mattress. We flashback to when Eddie was just four, and his father (Kevin Sizemore) left his mother‚Äîafter loudly proclaiming that he'd never wanted any of this, including Eddie. Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) tries to befriend her, but Barbara isn't interested. Mary Alice stops by one day to give Eddie a teddy bear and finds him home alone while his mom is out drinking. She lectures Barbara about not putting her needs ahead of her son, but the lesson clearly doesn't take. She hugs Eddie and tells him that \\"It's not your fault you ruined my life.\\" Gaby first meets Eddie when she moves to Wisteria Lane and finds a lonely Eddie inside her empty house‚Äîhe'd been sneaking in to play there since the previous owners moved out. He ends up coming over every day because Barbara has a new boyfriend. When he surprises Carlos and Gaby in the tub, Carlos orders Gaby to \\"cut him loose\\" and start making friends with other women, not nine-year-old boys. Gaby wants to go talk to Barbara, but Carlos advises her, \\"We don't want to be known as the nosy neighbors.\\" After Gaby tells him they can't be friends anymore, Eddie grabs a BB gun and shoots a bird. We next see teenage Eddie doing chores for Bree. He tells her \\"girls never notice me\\" and she gives him dating advice and extra money to buy gifts for the girl he likes. Bree goes to talk to Barbara when Eddie's object of affection ends up being Danielle. She returns the necklace Eddie left for Danielle and asks Barbara to \\"let Eddie down easy.\\" Instead, Barbara tells him that he needs to stop \\"stalking\\" Danielle. She goes on to say, \\"The only girl I ever thought he'd end up with would be blind, deaf or inflatable.\\" Bree tells him Danielle and he can still be friends. Eddie tells Bree, \\"I don't want a friend. I want somebody to love me.\\" Next, we see Eddie with a prostitute (Jamie Sorrentini). When she laughs at the flowers he has brought her, he strangles her. Susan meets Eddie at the coffee shop just after Mike starts dating Katherine. She praises Eddie's drawing and pays for him to take art classes. So Eddie is crushed to hear that she and Mike are back together‚Äîand getting married! \\"Don't marry Mike. You could marry me,\\" he offers. Not realizing he's serious she thanks him for the \\"good laugh.\\" Eddie tears up the drawings he made of her. That night, we see Eddie prowling outside her house and when he sees a woman come out, he attacks her, only then seeing that it's Julie, not Susan. He runs off. Eddie is playing charades with the Scavos when his mother comes over, demanding to know where he hid her booze. \\"I don't think you should talk to your son like that,\\" she tells Barbara. Lynette tells Tom, \\"We know something bad is happening, but we do nothing. I'm tired of being one of the people who does nothing,\\" she says. Tom suggests Eddie's old enough to strike out on his own, but Lynette thinks he's \\"too damaged.\\" Meanwhile, Barbara is confronting Eddie about his scrapbook. \\"Did you have anything to do with hurting those girls?\\" He nods and she sobs, \\"I didn't raise you to be like this.\\" \\"Didn't you?\\" He asks. \\"The worst mistake I ever made in my life was having you,\\" she spits out and he hits her with a bottle, then chokes her to death. Just then, Lynette shows up to ask him to move in with them. \\"You've got to get out of here, Eddie,\\" she tells him. \\"This isn't a healthy situation.\\" She sees his mother on the floor and assumes she's just passed out. Eddie accepts Lynette's invitation, then disposes of his mother's body. Mary Alice then concludes in her voice over that \\"Monsters are often created by other monsters.\\" Referring to Barbara's abusive nature.

This episode gathered 10.62 million Americans according to Nielsen Media Research, making this episode the least watched of season six and also the lowest rated episode of the season. Plot In the beginning of the episode, it is shown in the morning paper that a young local teenager has gone missing. Her family was quoted as saying that she vanished on her way to work and her friends were quoted as saying that she was not the type to run away from home; the police said that they had very little evidence to go on. Mike's truck is repossessed because he's behind on payments. \\"Enough with the macho pride,\\" Susan tells him, but he won't take any money from her. Susan comes up with a scheme: she pays her friends to clog up their plumbing. Mike catches on, especially as he finds Susan's earring in Gaby's drain. He insists he doesn't want her help. \\"If you can't let me help you, maybe there's something wrong with our marriage,\\" Susan says. Mike confesses his real money woes that he's totally broke to Carlos, who asks him, chequebook in hand, \\"How much do you need?\\" Andrew's been digging into Sam's past, including his supposed MBA degree. \\"Turns out golden child here never got his degree,\\" he tells Sam in front of Bree. Sam explains that he's a \\"few classes short\\" because he left school to care for his dying mother. Sam then shows Bree that Andrew charged some items to clients, then used them for himself. Andrew tells Bree that Sam is manipulating her, so she fires Andrew. Sam is alarmed to hear that she plans to eventually take Andrew back in. Shortly afterwards, the food is sabotaged at a dinner Bree is giving while trying to pitch an idea for her new cookbook. Bree sets the sprinklers off to avoid the embarrassment of people eating the food and rejecting the cookbook. Bree believes Sam when he says that it must be Andrew as he hadn't returned his keys; however, Orson points out that this kind of smart, subtle sabotage is more in Sam's style. Patrick Logan shows up at the coffee shop where Danny works and strikes up a conversation. He tells him he's writing a book. \\"It started out as a love story but now it's getting kind of dark.\\" He asks Danny for advice on what to do next with the story, which is about a woman who vanished with the main character's son. \\"Seems to me like the guy would kill her,\\" Danny suggests. Patrick responds, \\"That was my first instinct too.\\" Later, Angie arrives home, where she is unsettled by a noise. As she investigates, the phone rings and she calms down and asks Nick to hurry home. Behind her, we see Patrick through the French doors. The next day, he goes back to the cafe to tell Danny that it would be \\"too easy\\" to kill the woman and instead, he's going to have his main character take the son. Gaby overhears Bob and Lee fighting as their egg donor has backed out. Gaby suggests that they take hers. Carlos tells her he doesn't want her \\"handing out your eggs like party favors to every childless gay couple that wanders by.\\" Gaby won't listen to him, until Bob and Lee make it clear they don't want her to have an active part in raising the child. Gaby has Carlos tell Bob and Lee that the arrangement is off. When she goes to see how they're taking the news, she's shocked to hear that Lee has left Bob as he can't take the rejection and unhappiness of trying to have a child over and over again. Lynette takes Irina gown shopping and the Russian saleswoman translates a call Irina takes from an angry man, \\"Go ahead and call the police, you'll never find me.\\" Lynette tells Tom that Irina is hiding something and she will find out what it is. She goes to immigration and convinces a woman there to investigate Irina's past. Lynette learns that Irina's already married, to the man named Alexei who she took the call off in the bridal shop. She also has a record of cleaning out another man's bank account in Italy. Irina tells Lynette, \\"Give Preston your file. I will explain it all away. He will believe me, he always does.\\" But Preston's overheard the whole thing and calls off the wedding. Afterward Lynette apologizes and says she understand if Preston hates her but she loves him enough to let him rather than see him make a huge mistake. She kisses his head and leaves the room saying \\"Please don't take too long though as I miss you already.\\" At the end of the episode, Irina, banished from the Scavos' home, is found walking on the street out of town to find a motel. Eddie (Danny's friend) comes along and picks her up. While driving, Eddie offers Irina a relationship with him. Irina rudely turns him down, saying she is out of his league and didn't come to America to be with a greasy-haired little boy. Eddie's demeanor suddenly changes to something maniacal, and visibly angry, he pulls off the road and stops. Irina is then heard screaming. As she is lying dead on the ground, the newly revealed strangler digs a hole in which to bury her.

Current Festival The 41st Asian American International Film Festival will be held from July 25‚ÄìAugust 4, 2018. http://www.aaiff.org/event/venues History In 1975, grassroots media activists Peter Chow, Danny Yung, Thomas Tam and Christine Choy founded Asian CineVision (ACV),asiancinevision.org a nonprofit media arts organization \\"dedicated to promoting and preserving Asian and Asian American media expressions\\", under the name CCTV (Chinese Cable TV) in New York‚Äôs Chinatown. At a time of exceptional energy and assertion on the part of diverse cultural groups, claiming their voices and places in a landscape that had been dominated by European Americans, ACV‚Äôs founders saw the need to bring greater social and cultural awareness of Asian American experience and history to both Asian American communities and to the public at large. Moving-image media had become the nation‚Äôs common language, its most pervasive source of images and ideas, and Asian Americans barely registered on its screens. ACV‚Äôs founders wanted to address problems faced by Asian Americans in both representation in the media and access to the means of media production and distribution. Technologies and outlets for independent media were multiplying, creating new possibilities for Asian Americans both behind and in front of the cameras, in production and distribution, in scholarship and practice, in every style and platform of media arts. In 1978 ACV organized the Asian American Film Festival, the first in the U.S. to showcase the best in independent Asian and Asian American cinema. It was a three-day program of 46 films and videos at the Henry Street Settlement on New York‚Äôs Lower Eastside. Later screening venues included New York University (1979-1984), Rosemary Theatre (1985-1995), The French Institute (1996-2001), Asia Society (2002-2008), Chelsea Clearview Cinema, School of Visual Arts, Quad Cinema and Museum of Chinese in America (2009‚Äìpresent). AAIFF ºs primary goal is to exhibit the most current achievements in Asian/Asian American independent media-making to broad audiences‚Äîsome 100 short and feature films each year. Seeking to create a setting where artists, scholars, and cultural enthusiasts can meet and explore how to push creative bounds and the development of relevant media. Finally, the AAIFF presents works by media makers from various ethnic backgrounds, religions, classes, and creeds, in order to promote an understanding that Asian and Asian American experiences are complex and multiple. AAIFF satellite venues include Queens Museum, Cinema Arts Centre, Huntington, Brooklyn Heights Cinema, SUNY Stonybrook, Flushing Town Hall, Maysles Institute, Clearview Bergenfield 5, and Queen Library Flushing Branch. The films presented in AAIFF are featured in the annual National Festival Tour that has historically provided the seed-stock for most of the Asian American festivals that have sprung up in subsequent years around the country. Over the years, AAIFF has screened films from over twenty countries including: Canada, China (Hong-Kong and mainland), India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Germany, England, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Cuba, Indonesia, and Bhutan. ACV has also accomplished much to open exchange and introduce audiences to works from Asia and the Asian Diaspora. At the peak of its funding and program activity in addition to the annual AAIFF and the National Festival Tour, year-round activities included Videoscape, Children‚Äôs Film Festival and other exhibitions in film and video, media-production services for independent artists and producers in New York, publications including the quarterly media arts journal CineVue, a print and media archive, and a range of training workshops.http://asiancinevision.org/ References External links * Asian CineVision * Official Site-AAIFF * AAIFF'13 Press Conference Category:Asian-American culture in New York City Category:Asian-American film festivals Category:Film festivals in New York City ","title":"Asian American International Film Festival"},{"id":"26707528","text":"Clinical peer review, also known as medical peer review is the process by which health care professionals, including those in nursing and pharmacy, evaluate each other's clinical performance. A discipline-specific process may be referenced accordingly (e.g., physician peer review, nursing peer review). Today, clinical peer review is most commonly done in hospitals, but may also occur in other practice settings including surgical centers and large group practices. The primary purpose of peer review is to improve the quality and safety of care. Secondarily, it serves to reduce the organization's vicarious malpractice liability and meet regulatory requirements. In the US, these include accreditation, licensure and Medicare participation. Peer review also supports the other processes that healthcare organizations have in place to assure that physicians are competent and practice within the boundaries of professionally accepted norms. Overview Clinical peer review should be distinguished from the peer review that medical journals use to evaluate the merits of a scientific manuscript, from the peer review process used to evaluate health care research grant applications, and, also, from the process by which clinical teaching might be evaluated. All these forms of peer review are confounded in the term Medical Peer Review. Moreover, Medical peer review has been used by the American Medical Association (AMA) to refer not only to the process of improving quality and safety in health care organizations,http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/21/omss- bylaws-4thedition-final.pdf (page 131) but also to process by which adverse actions involving clinical privileges or professional society membership may be pursued.http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal- topics/medical-peer-review.shtml In addition, peer review methods are frequently used by state medical boards with respect to licensing decisions and complaint investigation. They are also used by insurance companies with respect to credentialing and utilization management processes. =Medicine= In US hospital settings, clinical peer review encompasses a wide variety of activities, whose scope varies across institutions. Virtually all programs perform retrospective medical record review (aka, case review) of the quality of care. Most also include Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) and Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE) required by the Joint Commission since 2007.https://www.jointcommission.org/jc_physician_blog/oppe_fppe_tools_privileging_decisions/https://www.jointcommission.org/jc_physician_blog/using_oppe_as_a_performance_improvement_tool/ Many also include the management of disruptive behavior (see Joint Commission. Behaviors that Undermine a Culture of Safety. Sentinel Event Alert 40 (2008). http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/SEA_40.PDF (last accessed 1/30/19)) and physician health programs. Routine clinical peer review activity (performance assessment) is typically organized separately from the credentialing/privileging process (competence assessment), but the results of peer review inform those decisions. From a legal and regulatory perspective, however, the line is blurred. The definition of a peer review body can be broad, including not only individuals but also (for example, in Oregon), \\"tissue committees, governing bodies or committees including medical staff committees of a [licensed] health care facility...or any other medical group in connection with bona fide medical research, quality assurance, utilization review, credentialing, education, training, supervision or discipline of physicians or other health care providers.\\"https://www.hortyspringer.com/peer- review-statutes-by-state/oregon-peer-review-statute/ (last accessed 1/30/19) Medical staffs generally rely on generic screens for adverse events to identify cases for peer review, even though that might not be the most efficient or effective method. These are generally applied through administrative data analysis, but referrals for peer review are frequently made by risk managers, nurses and medical staff. The median annual review volume is 1-2% of hospital inpatient admissions. Thus, case review may be the dominant form of adverse event analysis in US hospitals. Case reviews are typically conducted by individual reviewers, but in nearly 70% of hospitals, most reviews are presented and discussed in a committee prior to final decision-making. Nurses now participate on physician review committees in the majority of programs. This extends the trend of the past decade for adoption of multi-specialty representation in the direction of multi-disciplinary peer review. Some of these committees now routinely assess nursing care during the case review process and may even directly address all improvement opportunities. =Nursing= The American Nurses Association published the first definition of nursing peer review in 1988.American Nurses Association. (1988). Peer review in nursing practice. Kansas City, MO It includes the following statements: > The American Nurses Association believes nurses bare primary responsibility > and accountability for the quality of nursing care their clients receive. > Standards of nursing practice provide a means for measuring the quality of > nursing care a client receives. Each nurse is responsible for interpreting > and implementing the standards of nursing practice. Likewise, each nurse > must participate with other nurses in the decision-making process for > evaluating nursing care‚Ä¶Peer review implies that the nursing care delivered > by a group of nurses or an individual nurse is evaluated by individuals of > the same rank or standing according to established standards of practice‚Ä¶. > Peer review is an organized effort whereby practicing professionals review > the quality and appropriateness of services ordered or performed by their > professional peers. Peer review in nursing is the process by which > practicing registered nurses systematically access, monitor, and make > judgments about the quality of nursing care provided by peers as measured > against professional standards of practice. In Nursing, as in other professions, peer review applies professional control to practice, and is used by professionals to hold themselves accountable for their services to the public and the organization. Peer review plays a role in affecting the quality of outcomes, fostering practice development, and maintaining professional autonomy. American Nurses Association guidelines define peer review as the process by which practitioners of the same rank, profession, or setting critically appraise each other's work performance against established standards. The professionals who are best acquainted with the requirements and demands of the role are the givers and receivers of the review. Nursing peer review appears to have gained momentum as a result of growth of hospital participation in the American Nursing Association's Magnet Program. Even so, less than 7% of U.S. hospitals have qualified. Magnet hospitals must have at least 2 years of experience with a peer review evaluation process designed to improve practice and performance for all RNs for at least 2 years. The literature on nursing peer review is more limited than that which has been developed for physician peer review, and has focused more on annual performance appraisal than on case review. No aggregate studies of clinical nursing peer review practices have been published. Nevertheless, more sophisticated studies have been reported. Nursing professionals have historically been less likely to participate or be subject to peer review. This is changing, as is the previously limited extensiveness (for example, no aggregate studies of clinical nursing peer review practices had been published as of 2010) of the literature on nursing peer review Mostly what is mistakenly referred to as \\"peer review\\" in clinical practice is really a form of the annual performance evaluation. The annual performance review is a managerial process and does not meet the definition or outcomes needed related to peer review. Other organizational practices may violate the peer review guidelines set forth 1988 by the ANA 1988. The most frequent violation is the performance of direct care peer review by managers. One of the reasons for the confusion is that the ANA guidelines for peer review had been out of print prior to being reprinted and updated in 2011. The early ANA Peer Review Guidelines (1988) and Code of Ethics for Nurses (2001) focus on maintaining standards of nursing practice and upgrading nursing care in three contemporary focus areas for peer review. The three dimensions of peer review are: (a) quality and safety, (b) role actualization, and (c) practice advancement. Each area of contemporary peer review has an organizational, unit, and individual focus.Haag-Heitman, B. & George, V. (2011). Peer Review In Nursing: Principles for Successful Practice. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett The following six peer review practice principles stem from and are grounded in the 1988 ANA Guidelines and may help to assure an evidence-based and consistent approach to peer review: 1\\\\. A peer is someone of the same rank. 2\\\\. Peer review is practice focused. 3\\\\. Feedback is timely, routine and a continuous expectation. 4\\\\. Peer review fosters a continuous learning culture of patient safety and best practice. 5\\\\. Feedback is not anonymous. 6\\\\. Feedback incorporates the developmental stage of the nurse. Written and standardized operating procedures for peer review also need development and adoption by the direct care staff and incorporation into the professional practice model (shared governance) bylaws.Haag-Heitman, B. & George, V. (2010). Guide for Establishing Shared Governance: A Starter‚Äôs Tool Kit. Sliver Spring. MD: American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Confusion exists about the differences between the Professional Peer Review process, the Annual Performance Review (APR) and the role of peer evaluation. The APR is a managerial human resource function performed with direct reports, and is aimed at defining, aligning and recognizing each employee's contribution to the organization's success. In contrast, professional peer review is conducted within the professional practice model and is not a managerial accountability. Peer evaluation is the process of getting feedback on one's specific role competencies or \\"at work\\" behaviors from people that one works within the department and from other departments. \\"Colleague evaluation\\" is a more appropriate term than \\"peer evaluation\\" as this is not a form of professional peer review. =Pharmacy= There is limited published information about peer review among pharmacists. History The first documented description of a peer review process is found in the Ethics of the Physician written by Ishap bin Ali al-Rahawi (854‚Äì931) of al-Raha, Syria. His work, as well as later Arabic medical manuals, states that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practicing physician's notes to decide whether his or her performance met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient. Such practices are known to have continued into the 11th century. In the 1900s, peer review methods evolved in relation to the pioneering work of Codman's End Result System Codman EA. A Study in Hospital Efficiency. Boston, MA: T Todd Company; 1917. and Ponton's concept of Medical Audit.Ponton TR, \\"Gauging efficiency of hospital and its staff. Modern Hospital 1928;31(Aug):64-68. Lembcke, himself a major contributor to audit methodology, in reviewing this history, notes the pre-emptive influence of hospital standardization promoted by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) following WWI. The Joint Commission (on Accreditation of Hospitals) followed the ACS in this role from 1952. Medicare legislation, enacted in 1964, boosted the stature and influence of the Joint Commission because the conditions for hospital participation required a credible medical care review program and the regulations stipulated that Joint Commission accreditation would guarantee payment eligibility. What was once a sporadic process, became hardwired in most hospitals following the medical audit model. The widespread creation of new programs was hampered, however, by limitations in the available process models, tools, training and implementation support. Medical audit is a focused study of the process and/or outcomes of care for a specified patient cohort using pre-defined criteria. Audits are typically organized around a diagnosis, procedure or clinical situation. It remains the predominant mode of peer review in Europe and other countries.Toward Clinical Excellence: An Introduction to Clinical Audit, Peer Review and Other Clinical Practice Improvements . New Zealand Ministry of Health. 2 April 2002. https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/toward-clinical-excellence- introduction-clinical-audit-peer-review-and-other-clinical-practice In the US, however, the lack of perceived effectiveness of medical audit led to revisions of Joint Commission standards in 1980. Those modified standards dispensed with the audit requirement and called for an organized system of Quality Assurance (QA). About the same time, hospital and physicians were facing escalating malpractice insurance costs. In response to these combined pressures, they began to adopt ‚Äúgeneric screens‚Äù for potential substandard care. These screens were originally developed to evaluate the feasibility of a no-fault medical malpractice insurance plan and were never validated as a tool to improve quality of care. Despite warnings from the developers, their use became widespread.Sanazaro PJ, Mills DH. A critique of the use of generic screening in quality assessment. JAMA. 1991;265(15):1977-1981. In the process, a QA model for peer review evolved with a narrow focus on the question of whether or not the standard of care had been met. It has persisted despite the many criticisms of its methods and effectiveness.Edwards MT. \\"Peer review: a new tool for quality improvement. The Physician Executive Journal of Medical Management 2009;35(5):54-59. reprint requests Today, its methods are increasingly recognized to be outdated and incongruent with the Quality Improvement (QI) principles that have been increasingly embraced by healthcare organizations. There is good evidence that contemporary peer review process can be further improved. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has offered a Voluntary Review of Quality of Care Program for more than 2 decades. Perceived issues with the adequacy of peer review were an explicit reason for requesting this service by 15% of participating hospitals, yet recommendations for improved peer review process were made to 60%.Lichtmacher A. Quality assessment tools: ACOG Voluntary Review of Quality Program, peer review reporting system. Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am. 2008;35(1):147-162. A 2007 study of peer review in US hospitals found wide variation in practice. The more effective programs had more features consistent with quality improvement principles. There were substantial opportunities for program improvement. The implication was that a new QI model for peer review seems to be evolving. While it is premature to judge the potential effectiveness of this model, a 2009 study confirmed these findings in a separate sampling of hospitals. It also showed that important differences among programs predict a meaningful portion of the variation on 32 objective measures of patient care quality and safety. These findings were extended by cohort follow-up studies conducted in 2011 and 2015-16. The 2015-16 study refined QI model identifying 20 features that distinguish the most effective programs. These include among other factors: aiming first and foremost at improving quality, standardizing review process, maintaining high quality of case review, promoting self-reporting of adverse events, near misses and hazardous conditions, identifying opportunities for improvement in the review process (as opposed to casting blame), providing timely clinical performance feedback, recognizing clinical excellence, and establishing effective program governance. as additional multivariate predictors of the impact of clinical peer review on quality and safety, medical staff perceptions of the program, and clinician engagement in quality and safety initiatives. The online supplement to the report includes a program self assessment tool which is also available as a free online utility. Despite a persistently high annual rate of major program change, about two- thirds of programs still have significant opportunity for improvement. It is argued that the outmoded QA model perpetuates a culture of blame that is toxic to efforts to advance quality and high reliability among both physicians and nurses.  Legal and Regulatory Environment =United States= In the US, peer review activity is generally protected under state statutes. The protection may include confidentiality of the review process and protection to reviewers and institutions for good faith efforts to improve quality and safety through review activity. Such statutes may also specify whether or not the physician conducting the review must be in active practice. The nature of that protection varies widely. For example, Texas is generally considered to have fairly robust protections,https://www.hortyspringer.com/peer-review- statutes-by-state/texas-peer-review-statute/ (last accessed 1/30/19) whereas Florida protections https://www.hortyspringer.com/peer-review-statutes-by- state/florida-peer-review-statute/ (last accessed 1/30/19) were undermined by a constitutional amendment that exposed peer review data to discovery.http://flbog.sip.ufl.edu/risk-rx-article/the-florida-supreme-court- rules-on-amendment-7/ (last accessed 1/30/19)https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Patient%27s_Right_to_Know,_Amendment_7_(2004) (last accessed 1/30/19)  Health Care Quality Improvement Act US federal law generally trumps state law. The federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act (‚ÄúHCQIA‚Äù), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 11112, enacted in 1986, sets standards that professional review actions must meet in order to receive protection under the Act. It requires that the action be taken in the reasonable belief that it will advance healthcare quality based on facts obtained through reasonable efforts with due process and fairness to the involved physician. When peer review leads to an action to limit or revoke clinical privileges, the physician is entitled to both a fair hearing and the right of appeal.http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim- title42-section11101#=0&edition;=prelim (last access 1/30/19) Congress explicitly stated the rationale for this legislation as follows: > (1) The increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve > the quality of medical care have become nationwide problems that warrant > greater efforts than those that can be undertaken by any individual State. > (2) There is a national need to restrict the ability of incompetent > physicians to move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of > the physician's previous damaging or incompetent performance. (3) This > nationwide problem can be remedied through effective professional peer > review. (4) The threat of private money damage liability under Federal laws, > including treble damage liability under Federal antitrust law, unreasonably > discourages physicians from participating in effective professional peer > review. (5) There is an overriding national need to provide incentive and > protection for physicians engaging in effective professional peer > review.http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=&req;=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim- > title42-section11101&f;=&fq;=#=0&hl;=false&edition;=prelim (last accessed > 2/11/19) From the time of the HCQIA, there has been good alignment between regulatory and accrediting bodies with respect to due process requirements for physician disciplinary actions. These formalities apply primarily to questions of competence (credentialing and privileging) rather than performance (routine clinical peer review). It would be most unusual to find a hospital whose medical staff bylaws did not conform.  National Practitioner Data Bank HCQIA enabled the creation of a National Practitioner Data Bank and required hospitals, state medical boards and other health care entities who engage in formal peer review activities to report all disciplinary actions that affect clinical privileges for more than 30 days. This includes incidents in which a provider voluntarily resigns privileges while under investigation. An entity that fails to report as required may lose HCQIA protections for three years.https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/index.jsp (last accessed 2/11/19) The HCQIA (¬ß 11135) requires hospitals to query the NPDB in their initial credentialing and bi-annual provider re-credentialing processes. Structurally, this process fulfills the congressional intention of restricting movement of incompetent physicians. Disciplinary actions may be a red flag for issues of global incompetence, but the problem may be focal, not global. Thus, the NPDB has been criticized for having the unintended consequence of having adverse economic impact on providers who were reported regardless of the magnitude of the issue. Even so, gross under-reporting of adverse actions remains an issue.  Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (‚ÄúPatient Safety Act‚Äù), Public Law 109-41, USC 299b-21-b-26 https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2010-title42/USCODE-2010-title42-chap6A-subchapVII- partC-sec299b-22/summary amended title IX of the Public Health Service Act to create a general framework to support and protect voluntary initiatives to improve quality and patient safety in all healthcare settings through reporting to Patient Safety Organizations (PSO). This was intended to include peer review. The final rule promulgated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2008 at 42 CFR Part 3 https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx?SID=42192f8b6c83ddc436beeab06ef0ab90&mc;=true&node;=pt42.1.3&rgn;=div5%20%3c also includes protections against reprisals for good-faith reporters of adverse events, near misses and hazardous conditions. Several Florida health systems subsequently formed PSOs in expectation of using federal statutory protections to maintain the confidentiality of peer review activity that would have been exposed under Amendment 7. The subsequent legal challenges to this strategy go beyond the scope of this article. External Peer Review In the US, following enactment of the HCQIA, executives from various national medical associations and health care organizations formed the non-profit American Medical Foundation for Peer Review and EducationAMFPRE home to provide independent assessment of medical care. A 2007 study showed that the vast majority of physician peer review is done \\"in house\\": 87% of US hospitals send less than 1% of their peer review cases to external agencies. The external review process is generally reserved for cases requiring special expertise for evaluation or for situations in which the independent opinion of an outside reviewer would be helpful. The process is significantly more costly than in- house review, since the majority of hospital review is done as a voluntary contribution of the medical staff. Mandated external peer review has not played an enduring role in the US, but was tested back in the 70s. A 1972 amendment to the Social Security Act established Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO) with a view to controlling escalating Medicare costs through physician-organized review.Institute of Medicine, Lohr KN, ed. Medicare: A Strategy for Quality Assurance. Washington, DC: National Academy Press; 1990. (see chapter 7) The PSRO model was not considered to be effective and was replaced in 1982 by a further act of Congress which established Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs). This model too was fraught with limitations. Studies of its methods called into question its reliability and validity for peer review. A survey of Iowa state medical society members in the early 90s regarding perceptions of the PRO program illustrated the potential harm of a poorly designed program. Furthermore, the Institute of Medicine issued a report identifying the system of care as the root cause of many instances of poor quality. As a result, in the mid-90s, the PROs changed their focus and methods; and began to de-emphasize their role as agents of external peer review. The change was completed by 2002, when they were renamed Quality Improvement Organizations.The American Health Quality Foundation. Quality Improvement Organizations and Health Information Exchange. Washington, DC: March 6, 2006. (page 14) In contrast, external peer review has been used by German hospitals to lower their standardized mortality rate  Abuse  Sham peer review is a name given to the abuse of a medical peer review process to attack a doctor for personal or other non-medical reasons. State medical boards have withheld medical records from court to frame innocent physicians as negligent. Another type of review similar to sham peer review is \\"incompetent peer review,\\" in which the reviewers are unable to accurately assess the quality of care provided by their colleagues. Controversy exists over whether medical peer review has been used as a competitive weapon in turf wars among physicians, hospitals, HMOs, and other entities and whether it is used in retaliation for whistleblowing. Many medical staff laws specify guidelines for the timeliness of peer review, in compliance with JCAHO standards, but state medical boards are not bound by such timely peer review and occasionally litigate cases for more than five years. Abuse is also referred to as \\"malicious peer review\\" by those who consider it endemic, and they allege that the creation of the National Practitioner Data Bank under the 1986 Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) facilitates such abuse, creating a 'third-rail' or a 'first-strike' mentality by granting significant immunity from liability to doctors and others who participate in peer reviews. The American Medical Association conducted an investigation of medical peer review in 2007 and concluded that while it is easy to allege misconduct, proven cases of malicious peer review are rare.\\"Inappropriate Peer Review. Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association.\\" Parenthetically, it is difficult to prove wrongdoing on behalf of a review committee that can use their clinical and administrative privileges to conceal exculpatory evidence. The California legislature framed its statutes so as to allow that a peer review can be found in court to have been improper due to bad faith or malice, in which case the peer reviewers' immunities from civil liability \\"fall by the wayside\\". California law allows \\"aggrieved physicians the opportunity to prove that the peer review to which they were subject was in fact carried out for improper purposes, i.e., for purposes unrelated to assuring quality care or patient safety\\". Dishonesty by healthcare institutions is well-described in the literature and there is no incentive for those that lie to the public about patient care to be honest with a peer review committee.

The cause of the sinking remains in dispute, although evidence points to North Korea. A South Korean-led official investigation carried out by a team of international experts from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Sweden presented a summary of its investigation on 20 May 2010, concluding that the warship had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo fired by a midget submarine. The conclusions of the report resulted in significant controversy within South Korea. Following the sinking, South Korea imposed sanctions against North Korea, known as the May 24 measures. North Korea denied that it was responsible for the sinking. North Korea's further offer to aid an open investigation was disregarded.Watson Paul (19 July 2012). South Korea good, North Korea bad? Not a very useful outlook. The Guardian. Retrieved 26 December 2012. China dismissed the official scenario presented by South Korea and the United States as not credible. An investigation by the Russian Navy also did not concur with the report. The United Nations Security Council made a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker. Background The location of the sinking. Baengnyeong Island is a South Korean island in the Yellow Sea, off the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea. It lies less than from the North Korean coast, and is over from the South Korean mainland. The island is to the south and west of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime boundary dividing South Korea (ROK) from North Korea (DPRK). West Sea:Ryoo, Moo Bong.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of a rich fishing ground used by DPRK and Chinese fishing vessels, and there have been numerous clashes over the years between naval vessels from both sides attempting to police what both sides regard as their territorial waters. These have been referred to as \\"crab wars\\". =History of ship sinkings on both sides= In late May 2010, Bruce Cumings, a University of Chicago expert on Korean affairs, commented that the sinking should be regarded as part of long- running tensions in a naval no-man's land. He noted a confrontation in November 2009 in which several North Korean sailors died, and an incident in 1999 when 30 North Koreans were killed and 70 wounded when their ship sank. In both incidents, the North Koreans were the first to open fire. In the 1999 incident the South Koreans escalated matters by initiating a campaign of boat 'bumping' in order to stop what the South saw as a violation of its maritime borders. Considering these previous incidents, Cumings said that the Cheonan sinking was \\"ripped out of context, the context of a continuing war that has never ended.\\" =Military concerns= General Walter L. Sharp, Commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command at the time had, on 24 March, testified before the US House Appropriations Committee, in part, on the need to strengthen the ROK-U.S. alliance, the need for on-site advanced training of the Air Force, the need to improve the quality of life and provide tour normalization for troops serving one-year tours, planned relocation of bases, and the scheduled 2012 transition of Operational Control (OPCON) to ROK hands. He also warned of the possibility that North Korea could \\"even launch an attack on the ROK.\\" Sinking of Cheonan Thermal image of Cheonan sinking Another Pohang-class corvette, Sinsung On the night of the sinking, the U.S. and South Korean navies were engaged in joint anti-submarine warfare exercises 75 miles (121 km) away. This was part of the annual Key Resolve/Foal Eagle war exercise, described as \\"one of the world's largest simulated exercises\\", involving many U.S. and South Korean warships. On Friday, 26 March 2010, an explosion was reported to have occurred near , a , near the stern of the ship at 9:22 pm local time (12:22 pm GMT/UTC). This caused the ship to break in half five minutes afterward, sinking at approximately 9:30 pm about off the south-west coast of Baengnyeong Island. Some initial reports suggested that the ship was hit by a North Korean torpedo, and that the South Korean vessel had returned fire. However, the South Korean Ministry of Defense stressed in the first press briefings after the sinking that there was \\"no indication of North Korean involvement\\". Cheonan was operating its active sonar at the time, which did not detect any nearby submarine. Several theories have subsequently been put forth by various agencies as to the cause of the sinking. Early reports also suggested that South Korean navy units had shot at an unidentified ship heading towards North Korea, but a defense official later said that this target may have been a flock of birds misidentified on radar. The ship had a crew of 104 men at the time of sinking, and 58 crewmembers were rescued by 11:13 pm local time. The remaining 46 crew died. The stern of Cheonan settled on its left side in deep water close to the site of the sinking, but the bow section took longer to sink and settled overturned in of water away with a small part of the hull visible above the water. Rescue efforts Vice Admiral Kim Jung Du, commander for the Republic of Korea Navy salvage efforts, and Rear Adm. Richard Landolt, on scene commander of U.S. support to South Korean salvage efforts, discuss salvage operations aboard the Initially six South Korean navy and two South Korean coast guard ships assisted in the rescue as well as aircraft from the Republic of Korea Air Force. It was reported on March 27 that hopes of finding the 46 missing crew alive were fading. Survival time in the water was estimated at about two hours and large waves were hampering rescue attempts. After the sinking, President Lee said that recovery of survivors was the main priority. Air was pumped into the ship to keep any survivors alive.South Korea rules out navy ship sunk by North Korea, Reuters, Jo Yonghak, 27 March 2010 Over 24 military vessels were involved over course of the search-and-rescue effort, including four U.S. Navy vessels: , , , and . On 30 March 2010 it was reported that one South Korean naval diver (ROKN UDT/SEAL CWO Han Ju-ho) had died after losing consciousness while searching for survivors, and another had been hospitalised. On 3 April 2010, South Korean officials said that a private fishing boat involved in the rescue operations had collided with a Cambodian freighter, sinking the fishing boat and killing at least two people, with seven reported missing. The same day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that the body of one of the 46 missing sailors had been found. Later on 3 April 2010 South Korea called off the rescue operation for the missing sailors, after families of the sailors asked for the operation to be suspended for fear of further casualties among the rescue divers. The military's focus then shifted towards salvage operations, which were predicted to take up to a month to complete. Recovery A South Korean and U.S. diver during the recovery phase The first, stern section, recovery site On 15 April 2010, the stern section of the ship was winched from the seabed by a large floating crane, drained of water and placed on a barge for transportation to the Pyongtaek navy base. On 23 April 2010, the stack was recovered, and on 24 April the bow portion was raised. The salvaged parts were taken to Pyongtaek navy base for an investigation into the cause of the sinking by both South Korean and foreign experts. The bodies of 40 personnel out of 46 who went down with the ship were recovered. Their bodies were laid to rest at the Daejeon National Cemetery. Cause of sinking =Investigation= South Korean and U.S. Navy admirals inspecting the wreckage of Cheonan at Pyeongtaek on 13 September 2010. After raising the ship, South Korea and the United States formed a joint investigative team to discover the cause of the sinking. Later South Korea announced that it intended to form an international group to investigate the sinking including Canada, Britain, Sweden and Australia. On 16 April 2010, Yoon Duk-yong, co-chairman of the investigation team, said \\"In an initial examination of Cheonans stern, South Korean and U.S. investigators found no traces showing that the hull had been hit directly by a torpedo. Instead, we've found traces proving that a powerful explosion caused possibly by a torpedo had occurred underwater. The explosion might have created a bubble jet that eventually generated an enormous shock wave and caused the ship to break in two.\\" Traces of an explosive chemical substance used in torpedoes, RDX, were later found in May 2010. The Washington Post reported on 19 May 2010, that a team of investigators from Sweden, Australia, Britain, and the United States had concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the ship. The team found that the torpedo used was identical to a North Korean torpedo previously captured by South Korea. On 25 April 2010, the investigative team announced that the cause of the sinking was a non-contact underwater explosion. On 7 May 2010, a government official said that a team of South Korean civilian and military expertsExcerpts: South Korea ship sinking report, BBC, 20 May 2010 had found traces of RDX, a high explosive more powerful than TNT and used in torpedoes.Explosives from torpedo found on sunken ship, by Lee Tae-hoon Korea Times, 7 May 2010 On 19 May 2010, the discovery of a fragment of metal containing a serial number similar to one on a North Korean torpedo salvaged by South Korea in 2003 was announced. In their summary for the United Nations Security Council, the investigation group was described as the \\"Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group of the Republic of Korea with the participation of international experts from Australia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the Multinational Combined Intelligence Task Force, comprising the Republic of Korea, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States,\\" which consisted of \\"25 experts from 10 top Korean expert agencies, 22 military experts, 3 experts recommended by the National Assembly, and 24 foreign experts constituting 4 support teams\\". =Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group (JIG) report= Summary On 20 May the South Korean-led investigation group released a summary of their report in which they concluded that the sinking of the warship was the result of a North Korean torpedo attack, commenting that \\"The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine.\\" The inquiry also alleged that a group of small submarines, escorted by a support ship, departed from a North Korean naval base a few days before the sinking. The specific weapon used was alleged to be a North Korean manufactured CHT-02D torpedo, of which substantial parts were recovered. According to the Chosun Ilbo, South Korean investigators told their journalists that they believe that one or two North Korean submarines, a and the other a , departed a naval base at Cape Bipagot accompanied by a support ship on 23 March 2010. One of the subs, according to the report, detoured around to the west side of Baengnyeong Island, arriving on 25 March 2010. There, it waited about under the ocean's surface in waters deep for Cheonan to pass by. Investigators believe that the submarine fired the torpedo from about 3 km away. The attack appears to have been timed for a period when tidal forces in the area were slow. The North Korean vessels returned to port on 28 March 2010. Such detailed information on the North Korean submarine movements, and attack position, was not in the official summary or final report. CHT-02D torpedo propulsion section showing 1Î≤à marking The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May which include the 5√ó5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, was claimed to match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. An incorrect, though similar, torpedo schematic had by mistake been shown at the televised RIG briefing for comparison with the recovered parts. The correct schematic has never been made public. The markings in Hangul, which reads \\"1Î≤à\\" (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section, is consistent with the marking of a previously obtained North Korean torpedo, but inconsistent with one found seven years ago, which is marked \\"4Ìò∏.\\" Critics have pointed out that 'Ìò∏\\" is the term used most often in the North, rather than \\"Î≤à.\\" Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods. Simulations indicated that of TNT equivalent explosive at depth, to the port of the center line, would result in the damage seen to Cheonan. (PDF version of partial slide set) The full report had not been released to the public at this time, though the South Korean legislature was provided with a five-page synopsis of the report. Full report A draft copy of the report was obtained by Time magazine in early August 2010, before the final report was released. According to Time, the report assessed in detail ten possible alternative scenarios, with extensive discussion and explanation of why those ten were not possible. It finally settled on the eleventh explanation, which was a North Korean attack, which it said was a \\"high possibility.\\" In support of this conclusion, the report says that witnesses had reported seeing flashes of light or sounds of an explosion, as well as that the US Navy analysis of the wreck concluded that a torpedo containing 250 kilograms of explosives had collided with Cheonan six to nine meters below the waterline. Damage to the hull supported this conclusion, while inconsistent with what would be expected if the ship had run aground or had been hit with a missile. On 13 September 2010, the full report was released. It concluded that Cheonan had been sunk due to a torpedo explosion, which, while not having contacted the ship, exploded several meters from the hull of the ship and caused a shockwave and bubble effect of sufficient strength to severely damage and sink the ship. CHT-02D torpedo wreckage on display at the War Memorial of Korea, 23 March 2011 =South Korean opinions= According to a survey conducted by Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, less than one third of South Koreans trust the findings of the multinational panel. A later survey by the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper in 2011 found that 68 percent of South Koreans trusted the government's report that Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean submersible. Lee Jung Hee, a lawmaker with the opposition Democratic Labor Party, was sued for defamation by seven people at South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lee said during a speech in the national assembly that while the Defense Ministry had said there was no feed from a thermal observation device showing the moment the warship's stern and bow split apart, such a video did exist. Prosecutors then questioned Shin Sang-cheol, who served on the panel that investigated the incident and also runs Seoprise, over his assertion that Cheonan sank in an accident (HTML version) and that the evidence linking the North to the torpedo was tampered with. The Defense Ministry asked the National Assembly to eject Shin from the panel for \\"arousing public mistrust.\\"South Korea Faces Domestic Skeptics Over Evidence Against North, by Ben Richardson and Saeromi Shin, Bloomberg News, 30 May 2010 Shin stated that he doubted the official conclusion on the sinking, saying that when he looked at the dead sailors' bodies, they bore no signs of an explosion. Shin wrote a letter addressed to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showing the evidence for his contention that the ship ran aground and then collided with another vessel. =Russian Navy experts assessment= clamshell fragment inside one of screw hub holes Near the end of May a team of Russian Navy submarine and torpedo experts visited South Korea to conduct an assessment of the South Korean led investigation. The team returned to Russia with samples for further physical-chemical analysis. No official statement on the assessment has been made. It was claimed that the assessment concluded Cheonan was not sunk by a North Korean bubble jet torpedo, but did not come to any firm conclusion about the cause of the sinking. The Hindu quoted a Russian Navy source stating that \\"after examining the available evidence and the ship wreckage Russian experts came to the conclusion that a number of arguments produced by the international investigation in favour of the DPRK's involvement in the corvette sinking were not weighty enough\\". On 27 July 2010, The Hankyoreh published what it claimed was a detailed summary of the Russian Navy expert team's analysis. According to The Hankyoreh, the Russian investigators concluded that Cheonan touched the sea floor and damaged one of its propellers prior to a non-contact explosion, possibly caused by setting off a mine while the ship was trying to maneuver into deeper water. Visual examination of the torpedo parts South Korea found purportedly indicated that it had been in the water for more than 6 months. On the following day South Korean officials responded with \\"a full-scale refutation\\". On 3 August 2010 Russian UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin stated that his country's investigative report's conclusions into the sinking would not be made public.Yonhap, \\"Moscow Not To Make Public Probe Outcome On Cheonans Sinking: Amb. Churkin\\", 5 August 2010. Withholding the investigation results was seen as insensitive by South Korea, but avoided political damage to a number of states. =Chinese claims= During talks between the American and Chinese governments in late May 2010, Chinese officials were reported by Yoichi Shimatsu, a commentator for the Chinese state-run CCTV-9, to have claimed that the sinking of Cheonan had been as a result of an American rising mine, which was moored to the seabed and propels itself into a ship detected by sound or magnetics, planted during anti-submarine exercises that were conducted by the South Korean and US navies shortly before the sinking. To back up their claims, the Chinese said that North Korean submarines such as the one believed to have sunk Cheonan were incapable of moving undetected within South Korean waters, and a rising mine would have damaged the ship by splitting the hull, as was done to Cheonan, rather than simply holing the vessel as a conventional torpedo does. A conventional torpedo traveling at would also be completely destroyed upon impact, which was claimed to contradict the torpedo parts found later. (The original report, however, did not assert that a conventional torpedo strike had occurred, but rather that the torpedo had exploded underneath the ship, thus breaking its back. See above under Investigation.) =Other international research= A separate investigation conducted by scientists at the University of Manitoba yielded results that conflict with the official investigation's findings. According to the leader of the investigation, residue on the hull of the ship that was claimed to have been aluminum oxide, which is a byproduct of explosions such as that of a torpedo, had a far higher ratio of oxygen to aluminum, leading the researchers to conclude that \\"we cannot say that the substance adhering to the Cheonan was the explosion byproduct of aluminum oxide.\\" The South Korean Ministry of Defense issued a rebuttal to the findings, saying, \\"The detonation of explosives containing aluminum occurs within hundreds of thousandths of a second under high temperatures of more than 3,000 degrees Celsius and high pressures of more than 200,000 atm, and most of it becomes noncrystalline aluminum oxide.\\" A report published online by Nature on 8 July 2010 noted several instances of groups or individuals disagreeing with the official report. The article also notes the rebuttal of those disagreements by analysts and government officials, with one analyst arguing that the sinking was \\"consistent with North Korea's behaviour in the past.\\" In 2013, an academic paper was published analysing the available seismic data. It calculated that the seismic data recorded would be accounted for by a TNT-equivalent charge, similar to the explosive yield of land control mines which had been abandoned in the vicinity. In 2014, an academic paper was published analysing the spectra of the seismic signals and hydroacoustic reverberation waves generated. The paper found it doubtful that the vibrations of the water column were caused by an underwater explosion, instead finding that the recorded seismic spectra were consistent with the natural vibration frequencies of a large submarine with a length of around . This raised the possibility that the sinking was caused by a collision with a large submarine, rather than an explosion. Reaction = South Korea = South Korean President Lee Myung- bak convened an emergency meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Orders were given to the military to concentrate on rescuing the survivors. In Seoul, police were put on alert. At the time, a spokesman for the South Korean military stated that there was no evidence that North Korea had been involved in the incident. A large group of relatives of the missing sailors protested outside the navy base at Pyeongtaek over the lack of information provided to them. On 28 March relatives were taken to the site of the sunken vessel. Some relatives stated that survivors had claimed that the Cheonan had been in a poor state of repair. The Korean media have raised the issue of why the sister ship , which was operating nearby, did not come to the rescue of the sinking ship but instead fired shots at radar images which were later confirmed to be migratory birds. On 5 April 2010, President Lee Myung-bak visited Baengnyeong Island. He reiterated that it was risky to speculate over the cause, and the joint military and civilian investigation team would determine the cause. He said, \\"We have to find the cause in a way that satisfies not only our people but also the international community\\". The president of South Korea has mourned the victims and said that he will respond \\"resolutely\\" to the sinking without yet laying blame for its cause. On 24 May Lee Myung-bak said the South would \\"resort to measures of self-defense in case of further military provocation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\\" He also supported readopting the official description of the North as the \\"main enemy.\\" South Korea pursued measures from the United Nations Security Council after the incident, although the language used in the country's statements towards such measures became progressively weaker. In announcements made soon after the sinking, the government said that any draft presented by South Korea would explicitly state that North Korea was responsible for the incident, but by early July, the language had been reduced to only referring to \\"those responsible,\\" in response to concerns from Russia. Diplomatic Since the incident, the South Korean government has been reluctant to engage in further diplomacy with North Korea over disputes such as North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In response to a request by China, in April 2011 South Korea agreed to talks, but South Korean government officials commented that an apology from North Korea for the sinking would probably be necessary to facilitate any significant progress in the dialogues.The Korea Herald, \\"Seoul Insists on N. Korea Apology Before Dialogue\\", 18 April 2011; Yonhap, \\"Seoul Renews Demand For N. Korea's Responsible Steps Over Deadly Attacks\\", 18 April 2011. Military On 2 May it was reported that South Korea's naval minister vowed \\"retaliation\\" against those responsible. Admiral Kim Sung-chan, at a publicly televised funeral for Cheonans dead crew members in Pyeongtaek, stated that, \\"We will not sit back and watch whoever caused this pain for our people. We will hunt them down and make them pay a bigger price.\\"The Korea Herald, \\"Navy Chief Vows Revenge For Cheonan\\", 30 April 2010. On 4 May President Lee proposed \\"extensive reformations\\" for the South Korean military regarding the sinking incident. After the official report was released South Korea has said that it will take strong countermeasures against the North. Societal Writing in The New York Times, Korea scholar Brian Reynolds Myers stated that there was not much anger or outrage among ordinary South Koreans over the sinking. He stated that due to the inherently ethnic nature of Korean nationalism, there was no major uproar over the incident in South Korean society because of ethnic solidarity with North Koreans that many South Koreans feel, which Myers said overruled patriotism towards South Korea in many cases involving North Korea. Trade On 24 May 2010, South Korea announced it would stop nearly all its trade with North Korea as a result of the official report blaming North Korea for the sinking. South Korea also announced it would prohibit North Korean vessels from using its shipping channels. According to the New York Times, the trade embargoes were \\"the most serious action\\" South Korea could take short of military action. The United States openly supported South Korea's decision. The embargo is expected to cost the North Korean economy roughly $200 million a year. The decision to cease trade was followed up with the United States and South Korea announcing they would conduct joint naval exercises in response to the sinking. Psychological warfare The South Korean military announced that it would resume psychological warfare directed at North Korea. This would include both loudspeaker and FM radio propaganda broadcasts across the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Meanwhile, a North Korean military commander stated, \\"If South Korea establishes new psychological warfare services, we will fire against them in order to eliminate them\\", according to a report carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). South Korea began propaganda broadcasts into North Korea by radio on 25 May. North Korea responded by putting its troops on high alert, and severed most remaining ties and communications with South Korea in response to what it called a \\"smear campaign\\" by Seoul. South Korean military propaganda FM broadcasts were resumed at 18:00 (local time) starting with the song \\"HuH\\" by K-pop band 4minute. As part of the propaganda broadcasts, South Korea reinstalled loudspeakers at eleven places along the DMZ. There was originally a plan to also use electronic signs, although due to cost, the plan was reportedly being reconsidered. On 13 June, South Korean media announced that the South Korean Defense Minister, Kim Tae-young, had said that anti-North Korea broadcasts were planned to resume after the United Nations Security Council took action against North Korea in response to the sinking of Cheonan. Suppressing internal dissent Discourse over the events leading to the sinking of Cheonan was tightly controlled by the South Korean government in the months after the incident. On 8 May 2010, a former senior presidential secretary who served under Roh Moo-hyun, Park Seon- won,Korean newspapers have romanized his name as Park Seon-won; however, papers he published while as a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution indicate he romanizes his name as Sun-won Park. was charged with libel by South Korea's Defense Minister, Kim Tae-young, over comments he made during a 22 April interview on MBC radio asking for greater disclosure from the military and government. Park Seon-won's response to the charge was: \\"I asked for the disclosure of information for a transparent and impartial investigation into the cause of the Cheonan sinking;\\" he added that \\"the libel suit seeks to silence public suspicion over the incident.\\" South Korea's Minister of Public Administration and Security, Maeng Hyung-kyu, announced on 20 May 2010 that the government was stepping up efforts to prosecute people who spread \\"groundless rumors\\" over the internet: \\"Anyone who makes false reports or articles about the incident could seriously damage national security. We will not let these be the basis of any risks the nation faces.\\" Moreover, he announced the government would step up efforts to prevent \\"illegal gatherings\\" regarding the sinking of Cheonan. A South Korean military oversight board, the Board of Inspection and Audit, has accused senior South Korean naval leaders of lying and hiding information. Said the board, \\"Military officers deliberately left out or distorted key information in their report to senior officials and the public because they wanted to avoid being held to account for being unprepared.\\" In 2013, a documentary film named Project Cheonan Ship was released in South Korea about the sinking, including a number of possible alternative causes for the sinking. Members and relatives of the South Korean navy sought a court injunction to block the film's release on the basis that the film distorted the facts. The injunction was denied in court, however, a major cinema chain, Megabox, withdrew the film after warnings from conservative groups that they planned to picket showings the film. =North Korea= North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released an official response to the investigation on 28 May 2010, asserting, amongst other things, that it is unbelievable that part of a torpedo doing so much damage to a ship would survive: > Besides, the assertion that the screw shaft and engine remained undamaged > and unchanged in shape is also a laughing shock. Even U.S. and British > members of the international investigation team, which had blindly backed > the South Korean regime in its 'investigation', were perplexed at the > exhibit in a glass box. On 17 April 2010, it was reported that North Korea officially denied having had anything to do with the sinking, responding to what it referred to as \\"The puppet military warmongers, right-wing conservative politicians and the group of other traitors in South Korea\\". An article from KCNA entitled \\"Military Commentator Denies Involvement in Ship Sinking\\" stated that the event was an accident. > ... we have so far regarded the accident as a regretful accident that should > not happen in the light of the fact that many missing persons and most of > rescued members of the crew are fellow countrymen forced to live a tiresome > life in the puppet army.\\"Military Commentator Denies Involvement in Ship > Sinking \\", Korean Central News Agency. 17 April 2010. Retrieved 28 April > 2010. On 21 May 2010, North Korea offered to send their own investigative team to review the evidence compiled by South Korea,The Hankyoreh, \\"N. Korea's Reinvestigation Proposal Alters Cheonan Situation\\", 21 May 2010. and the Hankyoreh quoted Kim Yeon-chul, professor of unification studies at Inje University, commenting on the offer: \\"It is unprecedented in the history of inter-Korean relations for North Korea to propose sending an investigation team in response to an issue that has been deemed a 'military provocation by North Korea,'\\"and thus \\"The Cheonan situation has entered a new phase.\\" North Korea also warned of a wide range of hostile reactions to any move by South Korea to hold it accountable for the sinking. > If the South puppet group comes out with 'response' and 'retaliation', we > will respond strongly with ruthless punishment including the total shutdown > of North-South ties, abrogation of the North-South agreement on non- > aggression and abolition of all North-South cooperation projects. On 24 May, new reports indicated Kim Jong-il had ordered the armed forces of North Korea to be ready for combat a week before. The next day, North Korea released a list of measures that it will take in response to South Korea's sanctions. This would include the cutting of all ties and communications, except for the Kaesong industrial complex. They would revert to a wartime footing in regard to South Korea and disallow any South Korean ships or aircraft to enter the territory of North Korea. On 27 May, North Korea announced that it would scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea. It also announced that any South Korean vessel found crossing the disputed maritime border would be immediately attacked. On 28 May, KCNA stated that \\"it is the United States that is behind the case of Cheonan. The investigation was steered by the U.S. from its very outset.\\" It also accused the United States of manipulating the investigation and named the administration of US President Barack Obama directly of using the case for \\"escalating instability in the Asia-Pacific region, containing big powers and emerging unchallenged in the region.\\"DPRK accuses U.S. of cooking up, manipulating \\"Cheonan case\\" , by Xiong Tong, Xinhua News Agency, 28 May 2010 On 29 May, North Korea warned the United Nations to be wary of evidence presented in the international investigation, likening the case to the claims of weapons of mass destruction that the United States used to justify its war against Iraq in 2003 and stated that \\"the U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can occupy the Korean Peninsula just as it did Iraq with sheer lies.\\" The North Korea foreign minister warned the United Nations Security Council of risks of being \\"misused\\". It also accused the United States of joining South Korea in putting \\"China into an awkward position and keep hold on Japan and South Korea as its servants.\\" High ranking North Korean military officials denounced the international investigation and said North Korea does not have the type of submarines that supposedly carried out the attack. They also dismissed claims regarding writings on the torpedo and clarified that \\"when we put serial numbers on weapons, we engrave them with machines.\\" South Korea's Yonhap News Agency quoted South Korean officials as saying that North Korea has about ten of the . On 2 November, KCNA published a detailed rebuttal of the South Korean joint investigative team report. The Rodong Sinmun claimed that the \\"probability of a torpedo attack on (the) Cheonan Warship\\" was 0%. =International= When the official report on the sinking was released on 20 May there was widespread international condemnation of North Korea's actions. China was one of few exceptions, simply terming the incident \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"urged stability on the peninsula\\". This was speculated to be China's concern for instability in the Korean Peninsula. Researchers at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, drawing on interviews with Chinese officials and foreign policy experts, later argued that there existed an \\"inability of the top leadership to reach a consensus on how to react\\" to the issue, contributing to its comparatively restrained response. On 14 June 2010, South Korea presented the results of its investigation to United Nations Security Council members. In a subsequent meeting with council members North Korea stated that it had nothing to do with the incident. On 9 July 2010 the United Nations Security Council made a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker. China had resisted U.S. calls for a tougher line against North Korea. Later reports A member of the North Korean cabinet who defected to the south in 2011 said on 7 December 2012 that the crew of the North Korean submarine which sank Cheonan had been honored by the North Korean military and government. The defector, known by the alias \\"Ahn Cheol-nam\\", stated that the captain, co-captain, engineer, and boatswain of the mini-sub which sank Cheonan had been awarded \\"Hero of the DPRK\\" in October 2010.JoongAng Ilbo, N.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Mottram, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It stands in an elevated position at the top of a small hill. History St John's is a Commissioners' church designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe, and built in 1838‚Äì40. The church cost ¬£3,299 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) to build and ¬£2,599 of this was met by a grant from the Church Building Commission. The foundation stone was laid on 3 September 1838, the same day as that at St George's Church, Stalybridge, also designed by Sharpe. It was consecrated on 24 May 1841 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, who was at that time the Bishop of Chester. The church opened for worship in July. It provided seating for 1,234 people. Fifty years later the church was restored, with little alteration other than the addition of two windows to the chancel. Architecture The church is built in stone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with north and south aisles, a short single-bay chancel, and a tower at the west end. The tower is in four stages, it has a west door, and at the top is a coped parapet and pinnacles. A coped parapet also runs along the walls and gables of the church. The windows are paired lancets. Inside the church are galleries on three sides. The galleries and the nave arcades are supported by octagonal columns. The organ is in the west gallery.

The author of several books in German, he is also an ordained pastor of the Evangelical- Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg and president of the senate of the Luther Academy in Ratzeburg. Although Bayer is a major contemporary Lutheran theologian, so far little of his work has been translated from German into English.  Life  Oswald Bayer studied Protestant theology and philosophy in T√ºbingen, Bonn and Rome, received his doctorate in 1968 and habilitation in 1970 on the concept of promissio (promise) in the theology of the young Luther. His doctoral and postdoctoral work has been titled Promissio. He has also written on the history of the turning point in Luther's Reformation theology. Oswald Bayer taught from 1974 to 1979 as professor of Systematic Theology at the Ruhr University Bochum. In 1979 he was appointed director of the Institute for Christian Social Ethics at the University of T√ºbingen. In 1995 he moved to the chair of systematic theology. Since 2005, Oswald Bayer has been Professor Emeritus of Systematic Theology at the University of T√ºbingen.  Work  Oswald Bayer's theology is based on Luther's theology of word and promise which he uses to provide a critical engagement with modernity. To this end Bayer builds on Hamann's critique of Kant and the enlightenment, but also includes the developments in linguistics of the 20th Century (for example, Paul Ricoeur, Ludwig Wittgenstein). He has published numerous interpretations of Luther and Hamann. The center of theology is the promise of God to man to which man responds in faith. Faith is therefore always, to Oswald Bayer, a speech act, a spoken exchange between God and man. The exemplary center of this exchange is the Divine Service, the source and aim of all theology. Christian theology is therefore regarded as the interpretation of this speech act between the justifying God and the justified sinner. For Bayer this is - in reference to Martin Luther - the object of theology (the subiectum theologiae). A theology which interprets this word act, is itself always the hearer of the word of God. Oswald Bayer utilises this systematic approach in the areas of hermeneutics, theory of science, sociology and ethics, as well as in his sermons. The latter he makes available to a large audience as the G√∂ttinger Predigten im Internet. He uses his theology of the word pointedly against modern subjective theology in the tradition of Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher, as it is represented at present in modified form for example by Bayer's T√ºbingen colleague Eilert Herms. In addition, Bayer also engages in depth with other contemporary theological and philosophical systems (such as Marxism).  Bibliography  *Promissio.

While in the Coast Guard, he was stationed in Cape May and was the Sports Editor of the Coast Guard's Newspaper. Following his Coast Guard assignment, he started his media career in NYC at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample the Ad Agency. =Personal life= Simmons and his wife Harriet met in NYC where she was working as a medical technologist. Harriet was born and raised in Lynn, Massachusetts with roots in Savannah, Georgia. Their first date included the Elbow Room at the Beekman Towers, and her finishing his meal. They were married in Brentwood, New York at Simmons' uncle's farm in 1956. Harriet and Chet started their life together in Queens, New York while Simmons was working in Manhattan in the ad agency business and then later at Sports Programs Inc. founded by Edgar Sherick and later merged into create ABC Sports. While living in Jericho, Long Island, their first child Pam was born in 1959 (the same year the Dodgers beat the White Sox to win the World Series) and then Jed in 1960 (the same year the US won Olympic Gold in Men's Ice Hockey in Squaw Valley). With his growing life in sports, the family moved to Manhattan, where Pete was born in 1969 (the same year the Jets won Super Bowl III and the Mets won the World Series, both broadcast live on NBC Sports). While still with NBC, Chet and Harriet settled in Old Greenwich, Connecticut in 1971 and had Nicole (Nikki) in 1972 (the year NBC Sports televised the XI Olympic Games in Sapparo, Japan). In 1979, the family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut as the opportunity of ESPN unfolded in Bristol. The USFL called for a return to NYC and life in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1982. Harriet and Chet moved to Savannah in 1986, and settled on Tybee Island in 1992. Simmons was an avid New York Yankees, Dodgers (starting with the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field) and Alabama Crimson Tide fan. He loved listening to Mel Allen and Vin Scully on the radio and Tony Kubek, Joe Gargiola, Jack Buck, Greg Gumble and Chris Schenkel.

He was especially close to his four children and their spouses, Pam and Randy, Jed and Jana, Pete and Gaby, and Nikki and Micah, and nine grandchildren, Zach, Ella, Claudia, Streeter, Ben, Zander, Jack, Reid, and Tyler. =Television career= In 1957, while working at the ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Simmons accepted an invitation from Edgar Scherick to join Sports Programs Inc., which would evolve into ABC Sports four years later. Along with Sherick and Roone Arledge, Simmons help pioneer ABC Sports to become the leader in Sports Television in the United States with the creation of Wide World of Sports and full coverage of the Olympics. While at ABC Sports, he became vice president and general manager of programing. Called by colleague Roone Arledge \\"the sanest of my office mates\\", Simmons played a major role in laying the groundwork for helping ABC to carve its own niche in the world of network sports. In 1964, Simmons moved over to NBC Sports first as Director of Programming and moving up in 1977 to become the first President of NBC Sports. During his 15-year career at NBC, Simmons was instrumental in the creation of \\"instant replay\\" and securing major sports properties, including the American Football League, National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, NCAA basketball, the Rose and Orange Bowls, Wimbledon and the 1972 and 1980 Olympics (although the 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the United States and NBC's coverage was significantly reduced). Slightly more than five weeks prior to ESPN's official launch on September 7, 1979, Simmons joined as President bringing along fellow NBC Sports executive and long time friend Scotty Connal to head production and operations. Leaving the prestige and comfort of NBC Sports was natural for Simmons and Connal who strongly believed in the idea of a 24-hour sports network. However, at the time cable and satellite channels were just in their infancy with HBO launching in 1975 and CNN yet to go on the air. Simmons and Connal and the young ESPN team got the network up on time launching with the first SportsCenter hosted by George Grande and Lee Leonard followed by a slow-pitch softball game. Together, Simmons and Connal led the company through its infancy building a first class operation in Bristol, Connecticut.\\"Sports Broadcasting Pioneer Simmons Dies At 81,\\" The Associated Press, Thursday, March 25, 2010. During his three years, Simmons gave start to some of ESPNs most important franchises including SportsCenter, The NFL Draft and full coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Additionally, he is credited for the hiring of Chris Berman, Bob Ley, Greg Gumbel, Bryant Gumbel, George Grande, and many others. He left ESPN to become Commissioner of the USFL in 1982. George Bodenheimer, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks/president of ESPN, says that Simmons, working closely with Scotty Connal, shaped ESPN into something that was real and connected with sports fans. Simmons also forged a culture that is still ESPN's defining advantage in the marketplace, according to Bodenheimer. \\"He treated everyone like a colleague,\\" says Bodenheimer, who was a driver in the mailroom at the time. \\"And you had these two icons from the broadcast-sports industry who moved to a funny cable startup and got the best out of everybody.\\"http://[www.sportsvideo.org/halloffame/management/chet-simmons/, Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame.] In July 2014, Forbes magazine named Simmons as one of 7 CEOs Who Took A Gamble and Scored. Included in the list are Bill Gates (Microsoft), Larry Page (Google), Steve Jobs (Apple), Larry Ellison (Oracle), Fred Smith (FedEx) and Karen Kaplan (Hill Holiday). \\"He left his stable position at NBC Sports in 1979 to become president of a new cable sports network dubbed ESPN. In his three years there, he turned the upstart 24-hour sports network into a powerhouse in the TV industry.\\"\\"7 CEOs Who Took A Gamble and Scored\\" \\"Forbes\\", July 22, 2014. During Simmons time at ABC, NBC and ESPN, he helped discover, launch and develop the careers of some of the top announcers in Sports including Jim Simpson, Merlin Olsen, Jim McKay, Chris Schenkel, Greg Gumbel, Bryant Gumbel, Dick Enberg, Curt Gowdy, Tony Kubek, Joe Garagiola, Sandy Koufax, Vin Scully, Bud Collins, Donna de Varona, Bucky Waters, George Grande, Chris Berman, Bob Ley, Tom Mees, Dick Vitale, Cliff Drysdale, Sharon Smith, Tim Ryan, Marv Albert, and Jack Buck. =United States Football League (USFL)= In June 1982, Simmons was appointed the first Commissioner of the United States Football League a month after its formation. The spring and summer time professional football league was founded by David Dixon, a New Orleans entrepreneur. The League, headquartered in New York, launched with 12 teams in Philadelphia, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Birmingham, Oakland, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Michigan, Arizona Los Angeles, and New Jersey/New York. Owners included Myles Tannebaum, John Bassett, Alfred Taubman, J. Walter Duncan, and Bill Daniels. With Simmons success with the NFL Draft on ESPN, the League's first draft was held in NYC on January 4, 1983 where the Los Angeles Express selected quarterback Dan Marino of the University of Pittsburgh. Marino chooses to go pass on the Express and goes to the Miami Dolphins of the NFL who chose him 27th in the 1st Round.\\"NFL Draft 1983\\" Understanding the importance of big name players and coaches, the owners with Simmons and his top deputy Steve Erhart worked hard to land big names in the first year including running back Tim Spencer (Ohio State) who signed with the Chicago Blitz, Herschel Walker (University of Georgia) the New Jersey Generals (a three-year contract worth $1.2 million per year with a $1 million signing bonus, and ownership in one of J. Walter Duncan's oil wells), Greg Landry the Chicago Blitz, Chuck Fusina and Kelvin Bryant both with the Philadelphia Stars, Steve Spurrier to coach in Tampa Bay, George Allen as the coach of the Chicago Blitz, Red Miller formerly of the Denver Broncos to coach the Denver Gold, and Canadian Football League coaching legends Ray Jauch joining the Washington Federals and Hugh Campbell, joining the L.A. Express. Under Simmons leadership, the USFL expanded to 18 teams including Pittsburgh, Houston, Oklahoma, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Memphis and New Orleans (moved from Boston), secured TV rights with ESPN, and crowned three Champions ‚Äì Michigan Panthers (1983), Philadelphia Stars (1984), and Baltimore Stars (1985). The lineup of stars to play in the USFL included Brian Sipe, Steve Young, Bobby Hebert, and Doug Flutie. Due to Simmons' background in television, there was a perception that the USFL was a \\"made for television\\" entity. One of the USFL's first accomplishments under Simmons watch was the signing of a two-year contract with ESPN. It was the cable network's first- ever agreement with a sports league to televise select regular-season games. The USFL also had a two-year deal with ABC, consummated before Simmons' hiring.\\"LAOOC's Usher Replaces Simmons as the Commissioner of the USFL,\\" The Associated Press, Wednesday, January 16, 1985. The league incurred heavy financial losses and Simmons increasingly came under fire from some club owners for failing to negotiate a more lucrative network television deal. On January 14, 1985, Simmons' resigned as Commissioner. He was replacing by Harry Usher, an attorney who had served as the executive vice president and general manager of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. After Simmons's departure, the league tried to move a traditional fall schedule for the 1986 season, but the USFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. The USFL did win the case, but was awarded $1 in damages, and the league shut down.

Subsequently, he officiated in New Orleans, Charleston, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. Eckman established the \\"Gleaner\\" (in 1900 it was called the \\"Hebrew Observer\\") in San Francisco, and worked zealously to arouse the religious sentiment of the community. He belonged to the strict conservative school, and was noted for his scholarship. In San Francisco Eckman came to San Francisco in 1854. There he was Spiritual Leader of Congregation Emanu-El for a year. His term was characterized by an uncompromising stand on ritual matters.

His opera, Guatimotzin, a romanticised account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec emperor, Cuauht√©moc, was one of the earliest Mexican operas to use a native subject. Guatimotzin premiered on 13 September 1871 at the Gran Teatro Nacional in Mexico City, with √Ångela Peralta and Enrico Tamberlik in the leading roles.

Following the suicide of Prime Minister Alexandros Koryzis on 18 January 1941, amidst the German invasion of Greece, King George II of Greece considered him to head a new cabinet, but his candidacy was unsuccessful, as he was closely associated with the Metaxas Regime and few politicians were willing to work under him; the British ambassador to Greece, Michael Palairet, also opposed his nomination in talks with the King, due to Kotzias' Germanophile reputation. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, he lived in the United States. He was elected an MP for Athens in 1950 and was re-elected as the city's mayor in 1951, shortly before his death.

It is a subsidiary of the group SNI and the Kuwaiti group Zain. With more than 50 000 branches, Inwi is the third telecommunication company in Morocco, after Maroc Telecom and Orange. Inwi's network covers more than 92% of the country‚Äôs territory. History Based in Casablanca, Wanadoo Maroc was created in 1999, by Karim Zaz. In 2004 and following the withdrawal of France Telecom, Wanadoo Morocco sold its subsidiary Maroc Connect to local investors: Attijariwafa bank and Caisse de d√©p√¥t nationale via its subsidiary, Fipar holding. In 2005, ONA became the reference shareholder of Maroc Connect. In 2006, Maroc Connect won the third 3G license in Morocco. In 2007, Maroc Connect became Wana, the third operator for home telephones and 3G internet. In 2009, Wana wins the third GSM license in Morocco under its Inwi brand. In February, the Kuwaiti consortium Zain/Alajial takes control of 31% of Inwi‚Äôs capital. A year after its launch, Inwi reported five million customers in February 2010 and 13.5% of market shares in December 2010. In March 2015, Wana obtained its 4G license for the Inwi brand. The Brand had the best rating according to the criteria set by the ARNT (Coverage commitment, quality of service and business plan for the deployment of high and very high speed broadband in Morocco). The decision of ARNT to block the VoiP provoked a campaign of online protests against various Moroccan operators, including Inwi, in 2016. The company reacted by withdrawing from the sponsorship of the Maroc Web Awards and started the development of an application to use VoiP services. In September 2016, Inwi was the first operator to offer VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) technology to its 4G subscribers. Also in 2016, Inwi was awarded the Moroccan Digital Awards, which recognizes the best companies that stand out in the digital world, for its social initiative \\"Dir Iddik\\", a platform linking the associative world with volunteers. More than 50,000 people have registered since then.  Activities  =Mobile phones= The operator holds 24.20% of the entire mobile phone flee, in 2016. Following the opening of 07 numbers by the ANRT, Inwi customers were offered the possibility to customize their phone number. = Home phones = With the Bayn brand, Inwi offers a restricted mobility offer on the CDMA network. =Internet= Inwi offers Internet access for professionals via broadband ADSL and fiber optics as well as 3G and 4G coverage for individuals. In June 2016, the brand holds 25.15% of the market‚Äôs share, in second position behind Maroc Telecom. It holds more than 17 million internet subscribers. = VoiP service = Born from the alliance between Wana and the French company \\"Phone Systems & Network\\" in 2007, Bladiphone offers a communication service between France and Morocco through VoiP technology. = Double Play Offer = In 2017 and in partnership with the brand WanaOne, the operator developed a box to allow a reinforced access to Internet and telephone for companies. = Cloud = As of 2016, the operator proposed a professional service Cloud called \\"Business Digital Workplace\\". This service includes: * Infrastructure as a Service IaaS * Desktop as a Service, DaaS * Software as a Service, SaaS * Voice as a Service, VaaS  Other activities  Starting from October 2016, Inwi developed a consulting activity for digital companies (particularly Green tech and smart cities), via partnership with Numa Casablanca incubator. A dedicated incubation area (Open Lab Inwi) and other programs of training and raising awareness (Datacity) were launched on this occasion. On the occasion of the COP22 that took place in Morocco by the end of 2016, Inwi partnered with Moroccan Game Developers (MGD) to plan a contest that promotes the creation of Moroccan video games.

The channel is ultimately owned by All Around the World Productions, a British record label who also operated Channel AKA, Clubland TV and Planet Pop. History Lava logo The channel launched on 29 March 2010 on Sky channel 378 as Lava. Lava specialised in the Indie and rock music genres. Lava's remit was to provide a platform for young rock, pop punk and indie musicians, and features young unsigned music acts from around the United Kingdom. Lava was a sister channel of Channel AKA, which was also owned by Mushroom TV, and replaced Rockworld TV which operated on Sky channel 378 and closed at 7.00am on 29 March 2010. Both the Lava and Channel AKA formats allowed viewers to decide on the station's playlist through the use of a voting system which enables viewers to watch the videos they want to see. On 26 April 2011, Lava was rebranded as Greatest Hits TV at 23.45pm. Lava continued on Greatest Hits TV as overnight programming block, called Lava Showcase, between 3.00am and 8.00am, until the autumn 2012 widescreen relaunch of GHTV. On 22 June 2012, Mushroom TV entered liquidation. Ofcom's television broadcast licensing update for May 2012, indicates that Greatest Hits TV was sold to UltimateHits Limited. In early autumn 2012 GHTV (and Channel AKA) were relaunched in 16:9 widescreen with new onscreen graphics. GHTV moved from an 'artist showcase' format to a wider format including more multi-artist chart- countdown shows: single-artist programmes focused on major stars' work (typically billed as \\"Every Big Hit From [name]\\") continue to appear on occasion. In the relaunch, the channel also moved from mostly focusing on current artists to a cover broader range encompassing 80s and 90s hits as well as contemporary output. The relaunch also saw the Lava Showcase block dropped in favour of various-artist overnight block 'Insomnia'. On 16 November 2012 the channel was temporarily renamed 'Christmas Hits TV' with a change to Christmas themed programming and the on-screen graphics and idents. On 21 June 2013, the channel introduced seasonal branding once again, renaming itself as 'Summer Hits TV'. On 23 October 2013 the channel was closed and replaced by NOW Music.

During the 2008‚Äì09 IRB Sevens World Series, Grant took over as captain from the injured Scott Forrest and went on to captain Edinburgh at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 Celtic League campaign. Early life Grant was born in Jwaneng, Botswana to Scottish parents and soon after moved to Cape Town, South Africa. He attended Western Province Prep School where he started playing rugby at the age of 11. From there he moved on to Bishops where he continued his sporting career. It was here that Grant was selected to play for the South African under-15 and under-16 waterpolo sides. Halfway through his high school career he moved out of the Western Cape to the Midlands of Natal to attend Hilton College. It was here that his rugby career really started to take shape moving from the centres to the back row. Grant played for the school's first XV as well as the Natal Schools side. Upon completing high school, Grant moved to Scotland where he began his professional career. Rugby runs in Roddy's family: his grandfather (Bob) and great-uncle (George) were international referees, the latter was also Scotland full back in 1950 and 1951 and manager of the 1977 Lions in New Zealand, and Grant's father played for British Universities. Career He joined Border Reivers in summer 2006 as an apprentice, and the following January he made his debut for the professional team as a substitute in the Magners League match against Newport Gwent Dragons at Rodney Parade. He was awarded the 2008 John Macphail Scholarship, allowing him to have a summer playing for Auckland University club in New Zealand. Grant started as open-side flanker in all five of Scotland's matches in the 2006 Under 19 Rugby World Championship in Dubai in April 2006. Later that year he made his international sevens debut for Scotland in the Dubai tournament which opened the IRB's 2006‚Äì07 series. He played in six of the tournaments in that series. That season, too, he had his Scotland Under-20 debut in the February 2007 match against England in Bath, and he continued in that team for the game against France in Bourg-en-Bresse. In November 2008 he was the Scottish Thistles‚Äô joint-top scorer with 45 points (nine tries) in the Singapore international sevens, and he went on to play in the Scotland squad in the 2008‚Äì09 IRB tournaments in Wellington (New Zealand), San Diego (USA), Hong Kong, Adelaide, Twickenham and Murrayfield as well as the RWC Sevens in Dubai, where he scored four tries in helping Scotland to win the Plate competition. Over the 2008‚Äì09 sevens season he scored 23 tries, and his points tally of 115 was second only to Colin Gregor‚Äôs 171. Grant also played two games for Scotland A in the IRB Nations Cup success in Bucharest in June 2009. His debut was as a replacement in the win against Russia, and his first start followed four days later in the victory against Uruguay. That same month he signed a professional contract with Edinburgh, and his Scotland A career continued with a replacement appearance in the 38‚Äì7 win against Tonga at Netherdale, Galashiels, in November 2009. Grant was subsequently nominated for Young Player of the Season in the Celtic League for season 2009‚Äì10. Grant trained with the senior Scotland squad during the 2010 Six Nations Championship. On 26 December 2013, Grant made his 100th appearance for Edinburgh, leading the team out onto the Murrayfield pitch for the Boxing Day Pro12 derby clash with Glasgow Warriors. In March 2015, Grant signed a new contract with Edinburgh, which will see him remaining at Murrayfield until 2016. In August 2015, he scored a hat-trick of tries against Romania's Rugby World Cup side. Edinburgh won the match 31‚Äì16. In December 2015 he was forced to retire following an injury. He joined the Scottish Rugby Academy and in May 2017 was promoted to Edinburgh forwards' coach.

It was released on Friday 14 May 2010 and distributed by Warner Music Australia. For those who pre-ordered the album on the band's website, they received the digital album on the day of its release, as well as the hard copy of the album, sent through the mail. The band also announced a This Is the Warning album launch tour which will play shows in most major capital cities in Australia. Tasmanian graphic artist Cameron Gray has collaborated with the band and his artwork is featured on the album's cover and booklet. Some of his work has already been revealed on the Project Dead Letter website. Singles The album tracks \\"Reaction\\" and \\"Next in Line\\" were released in 2008 as part of a 3-track EP, but were later also included on the album. The first official single from the album was \\"The Space on the Wall\\", released on 11 August 2009, followed by \\"Big\\", released on 9 April 2010, available as a free download on the band's website. The final single released from the album was \\"One Step\\". All three official singles, as well as \\"Reaction\\" received a music video. Project Dead Letter site As a way to get fans to get an insight into the making of the album, Dead Letter Circus created a website, the Project Dead Letter page. The aim of the site was to give fans new material every day, whether it was a snippet of a song, a live performance, pictures, video, and so on. However, to gain access to the site, fans first had to pre-order some form of the album. It started on 1 March 2010, and from thereon it gave fans all of the above, and more. Every now and then the band uploaded a full finished song from the album for fan's enjoyment. \\"Here We Divide\\" was first; after having snippets of it uploaded previously, it became available for full .mp3 download on Day #5. (It was not the first song from the album to be released, however, as \\"The Space on the Wall\\" had been released as a single prior to the Project Dead Letter site's creation, and was already available on iTunes). The band continued to upload news of the album every day for the next 2 months, even uploading (in 2 separate parts) a live performance they did at their hometown. The next song to be released was \\"Big\\", the second single, on Day #40 - it too had been uploaded in snippets prior to this. Then came the album's title track on Day #61. All of the songs had their lyrics uploaded after release on the site. (Note: the band did not upload the full title track onto the site, as the album version had almost a minutes-worth of instrumentals at the start, whereas the version on the site cut this out. The album version was almost a minute longer). As of Day #66, (on 5 May) the band began streaming songs that hadn't already been released on the Project. It started with \\"One Step\\", on that day, then \\"This Long Hour\\" on 6 May, Day #67, \\"The Drum\\" on Day #68, \\"The Design\\" on Day #69, and \\"Walk\\" on Day #70. The band also announced that the entire album is up for streaming on their MySpace. On the day of the album's release the whole album was put up for download on the site, as well as being sent to those who pre-ordered the album. The band was both sad that The Project was finished, but excited the album was finally released. Themes The band have stated that the album is \\"a first person account of awakening to the construct that has been put in place in an attempt to control and mold us. However, it's also about refusing to be a subject of it and forging your own path.\\" In 2011, Benzie revealed in-depth the concept behind the album; \\"the album‚Äôs basically a document of the awakening, realising that there is this structure and not being a part of it. We don‚Äôt really exist in that world, within the band.We haven‚Äôt watched television for five years. You can‚Äôt avoid it, obviously, but we‚Äôve been so busy doing this thing. With the internet, we started to inform ourselves a long time ago. That became our news media. You get an ear for what‚Äôs the truth.\\" Benzie went on to reveal the real-world events that inspired the lyrics for the album; \\"war over oil fields and stuff like that. The disgrace of certain governments. Everyone can probably guess which governments we‚Äôre talking about. The larger Western world. The way that they go about obtaining what they need from the poor countries, everything from Iraq to Africa. You kill many people so you can run an oil pipeline through their country. 9/11 ‚Äì that whole time was so surreal. It really shaped our world.\\" Artwork The album's artwork was done by artist Cameron Gray, whose pieces were also used for the singles, as well as poster and merchandise designs. Gray was discovered by Benzie who was looking for an artist that captured the visual feel of the band; \\"I really liked him when I found him online. I‚Äôd actually been searching all these artists, and I was looking at this surrealist stuff, I think it was, artists in his style, and I just looked at his stuff and felt this real connection. Everything he does is very first person, and all our songs are generally from the first person [perspective].\\" Benzie also revealed that the artwork was a creative process, with Benzie providing Gray with the music and lyrics, to which he interpreted and produced the body of work that would become the album artwork; \\"How we did it is basically I would send him the song and the lyrics, and then he‚Äôd send something back and go, \\"Is this what you mean?\\" But like any conversation, it was pretty easy to misunderstand each other, so if he didn't get it right the first time, or if he missed the meanings of the songs, which is also very easy to do, I would send him back a two-page rant about whatever the song was about.

ARIS BPM Community This new version changes the file format of ARIS Express so that models can be shown in an interactive model viewer in ARIS Community.How to embed an ARIS Community model into your page  ARIS BPM Community The release announcement contained no details about additional features or changes. Functionality =Overview= ARIS Express is a standalone single- user application. It is divided in a home screen and a modeling environment. The home screen is used to create new models or open recently edited ones. The modeling environment is used to edit diagrams. =Supported notations= The following notations are supported by ARIS Express. Users can create diagrams containing an unlimited number of modeling objects. * BPMN 2 Collaboration Diagrams * Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) * Organizational charts * Process landscape (value-added chain diagram) * Data model in ERM notation * IT infrastructure (network diagram) * System landscape (component diagram) * Whiteboard * General diagram = Noteworthy features= Besides common features such as creating new diagrams, saving them as files or adding objects to the modeling canvas, ARIS Express also provides some noteworthy features, which can't be found in most comparable modeling tools. * fragments - Often used modeling constructs such as an exclusive decision in a process model can be stored as fragments so that they are available for direct reuse in another model. * smart designs - The flow of a process model or hierarchies of other models can be captured in a spreadsheet-like interface. While entering the data in the spreadsheet, the model is generated and laid out in the background while typing. * mini toolbar - While moving the mouse pointer over an object in a diagram, a small toolbar is shown allowing quick access to the most important modeling actions. * Microsoft Visio import - Diagrams created with Microsoft Visio 2007 or above can be imported to and edited in ARIS Express. A Microsoft Visio export is not provided. * ARISalign import - Models created on the online collaboration platform ARISalign can be opened and edited in ARIS Express. =Exports= ARIS Express can export diagrams to different formats such as: * PDF * JPEG * PNG * EMF * ADF ADF is the file format of ARIS Express. The professional tools of ARIS Platform are able to import diagrams stored in the ADF format. Yet, there are major limitations during import - namely, each object in diagram will be treated as unique object, despite having same type and name, forcing redrawing large sections of diagrams after import. Besides export formats, it is also possible to use the clipboard to copy and paste an ARIS Express diagram into typical office suites such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Technology ARIS Express is a Java-based application, which shares some of the features of ARIS Platform products such as ARIS Business Architect and ARIS Business Designer. In contrast to ARIS Platform products, ARIS Express doesn't use a central database for model storage. Instead, each diagram is stored in an ADF file. ARIS Express uses Java Web Start. After download, the application can be started immediately without installation procedure. For Microsoft Windows based systems, an ordinary setup is provided, too. ARIS Express requires Java 1.6.10 or above. On first startup, the user must enter a valid ARIS Community account to register the application. Creating an ARIS Community account is free-of-charge. After installation, no Internet connection is needed to use ARIS Express. ARIS Express uses a mechanism provided by Java Web Start to automatically update the application as soon as a new version becomes available and the user is connected to the Internet during startup. There are reports that this automated update failed while upgrading from version 1.0 to version 2.0. As ARIS Express is based on Java Web Start, it can be installed on any platform supported by Java. The ARIS Community and other Internet sources have reports of successful deployment of ARIS Express on other operating systems than Microsoft Windows. However, ARIS Express is officially supported only on Microsoft Windows.ARIS Express system requirements  ARIS BPM Community Miscellaneous A quick reference sheet is available for ARIS Express. The poster shows all supported diagrams plus the most important modelling concepts for each supported modelling language.ARIS Express quick reference  ARIS BPM Community ARIS Express contains a hidden game, a so-called Easter Egg.Do not read this post!

The wingspan is 40‚Äì45 mm. The moth flies from May to September depending on the location. The larvae feed on Thalictrum species. Behavior =Sexual selection= This species feeds only on fruit, but during experiments when Russian moths were offered human hands, they drilled their hook-like tongues under the skin and sucked blood. Some moths can suck blood for up to 20 minutes. This is an example of a phenomenon called mud- puddling, in which males aggregate on specific substances to obtain nutrients. Only male moths suck blood. This behavior seems to have evolved so that they may pass on salt to females during copulation, providing a nutritional boost for young larvae who feed on leaf-rich but sodium-poor diets. Blood feeding may have also evolved from animal-related behaviors like feeding on tears, dung, or pus-filled wounds. The increase in blood sucking behavior of these moths is related to the advantage of providing sodium to females to pass on to their offspring. Research has seen morphological changes that reflect this behavior. The number of olfactory sensilla is reduced in C. thalictri males that took a blood meal compared with those that did not in a research environment. The selectivity of sensilla coeloconica olfactory sensory neurons was investigated and demonstrated sensitivity to fifteen vertebrate-related volatiles, including ammonia. The reduction in olfactory sensilla sensitive to vertebrate-related compounds may be correlated to an increase in the likelihood of a male C. thalictri to take a blood meal, leading to sexual selection of such males and an increase on the blood-sucking behavior in the C. thalictri population. =Mating and genetic benefits= Males and females rely on pheromones using antennae adaptations that allow them to find a mate. Males have such strong receptor capabilities they can sense a female's pheromones within 300 feet, and the pheromones are specific to each so that moths avoid mating with the wrong species. Females release pheromones from a specialized gland in the abdomen to attract males. Males follow the scent of an attractive pheromone, but as they fly they lose specificity and care less about which scent they follow. The attractiveness of a female's pheromone matters less than her ability to make a male smell her scent first before he senses that of another female. Male pheromones convey more detailed information about age, reproductive fitness, and ancestry. Males have a special gene in their antenna that mutates in response to changes in female pheromones. This adaptation to species-specific changes helps ensure that reproduction occurs. Tiny feathery tips along the antenna pick up the slightest hint of pheromone released by females to guide males to their mates. Genes that allow for more refined antenna tips will lead to more reproductively fit males. =Mate choice= Males and females have specific ways of choosing mates. Females can learn information about males from male pheromones, usually not showing any preference or mate discrimination. Females can be selective at times by secreting very low amounts of pheromones and attract males who have high antenna sensitivity. Males are attracted to the one-billionth of a gram of pheromones released by a female moth for location. Males are more likely to mate with a larger female.

The team began play as the Indianapolis Colts in the 1984 NFL season. Irsay moved the team in the dead of night on March 28‚Äì29, 1984, after the city of Baltimore proved unwilling to replace Memorial Stadium and the Maryland General Assembly was on the verge of passing legislation allowing the city to seize the team via eminent domain. The move embittered many Baltimoreans for decades, and has had a lasting impact on the NFL, including another controversial relocation 12 years later that brought Baltimore its current NFL team, the Ravens. Actions leading up to the move The Colts had played at Memorial Stadium since 1953 Although the Colts had been successful since arriving in Baltimore for the 1953 NFL season, Memorial Stadium was claimed to be inadequate for both them and Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles. In May 1969, the city of Baltimore announced it would seek a substantial increase in Memorial Stadium rental fees from Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom and the team itself. Rosenbloom had already called Memorial Stadium \\"antiquated\\" and had threatened to move all Colts home games out of the stadium unless improvements were made. Rosenbloom even considered using $12‚Äì20 million of his own money to help fund the building of a new football-only stadium on land in adjoining Baltimore County. By November 1971, Rosenbloom announced that the Colts would not return to Memorial Stadium when their lease ran out following the 1972 season and that he was not interested in negotiating with the city anymore. He wanted out of Baltimore for several reasons‚Äîteam revenue, problems with Baltimore Orioles ownership relating to Memorial Stadium revenues, a running feud with the Baltimore press, and his new wife's desire to move to the West Coast. In 1971, Baltimore mayor William Donald Schaefer and Maryland governor Marvin Mandel created a stadium committee to examine the city's stadium needs. Their report was a blow to Memorial Stadium. Some of the problems mentioned: 10,000 of the stadium's seats had poor views of the field; 20,000 seats were out-dated bench seats that had no back support; 7,000 seats were poorly constructed temporary bleachers that were installed for football games only. Also, there was not enough office space for the front offices of either the Orioles or Colts, much less both teams combined. Both teams had to share locker rooms. The upper deck of Memorial Stadium did not circle the field, ending instead at the 50-yard line. Any expansion plans for the stadium had usually mentioned less attractive (and less expensive) end-zone seats, not upper deck seating. Lastly, the number of bathroom facilities in Memorial Stadium was deemed inadequate. =Baltodome project= Maryland's planners came up with an ambitious project. Nicknamed the Baltodome, the original plan was to create a facility near the city's Inner Harbor known as Camden Yards. The new stadium would host 70,000 fans for football games, 55,000 for baseball, and 20,000 as an arena for hockey or basketball. For an estimated $78 million, the city would build a facility that would have kept all parties happy: Orioles owner Hoffberger, Colts owner Irsay, the Stadium Complex Authority (whose Chairman Edmond Rovner reiterated in 1972 that \\"A major consideration in Mr. Irsay's trading of franchises was the city's firm commitment to proceed with these plans.\\"), Baltimore Mayor Schaefer, and Governor Mandel. However, the proposal did not receive support to pass the Maryland legislature, in spite of assurances that contributions from taxpayers would be limited strictly to city and state loans. On February 27, 1974, Governor Mandel pulled the plug on the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: \\"I will bow to the will of the people. They have told us what they want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club.\\" Irsay was willing to wait. \\"It's not a matter of saying that there will be no stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of Baltimore are going to see those new stadiums in New Orleans and Seattle opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football.\\" Hyman Pressman, Baltimore's comptroller, was against using any public funds to build a new stadium. During the 1974 elections, Pressman had an amendment to the city's charter placed on the fall ballot. Known as Question P, the amendment called for declaring \\"the 33rd Street stadium as a memorial to war veterans and prohibiting use of city funds for construction of any other stadium.\\" The measure passed 56 percent to 44 percent, and the same political motivations that had been used to upgrade Baltimore Stadium, originally built in 1922, in the late 1940s and rename it Memorial Stadium, effectively destroyed any chance of a new, modern sports complex being built in Baltimore. =1975‚Äì1980= Although the Colts made the playoffs for three straight years from 1975 to 1977, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team. Robert Irsay first spoke with Phoenix, Arizona, in 1976 and then Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1977 about the possibility of moving his team to one of those cities. In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an attractive offer to move the franchise to Phoenix. Then, in 1977, he said, \\"I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but when are we going to find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I don't want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore.\\" In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had \\"inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location.\\" Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improved the plumbing, and gave both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long-term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.Euchner, p. 108. Move to Indianapolis The Hoosier Dome was constructed with a view to attracting an NFL franchise to Indianapolis Under the administration of Mayor Richard Lugar and then continuing with successor, William Hudnut, the City of Indianapolis was making a serious effort to reinvent itself into a \\"Great American City.\\" In 1979, Indianapolis community leaders created the Indiana Sports Corporation in order to attract major sports events to central Indiana. The next year, Hudnut appointed a committee to study the feasibility of building a new stadium that could serve primarily as a boon to the city's convention business and, secondarily, as a lure for an NFL team. =Construction of the Hoosier Dome begins= In 1982, construction of the Hoosier Dome (later renamed the RCA Dome) began. Deputy Mayor David Frick, who later led the negotiations with the Colts and then went on to become chairman of the Indiana state commission that oversaw construction of the RCA Dome's replacement, Lucas Oil Stadium, later said that the RCA Dome was a key to changing the city's image. \\"Sports was an element in our game plan to change the image of the city back in the late 1970s, early 1980s.\\" Baltimore reportedly did offer Irsay a $15 million loan at 6.5%, a guarantee of at least 43,000 tickets sold per game for six years, and the purchase of the team's Owings Mills training facility for $4 million. =Negotiations with Phoenix and Indianapolis= On March 2, 1984, NFL owners voted to give Irsay permission to move his franchise to the city of his choosing. Irsay continued discussions with several cities hungry for an NFL franchise (New York City, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Memphis, and Birmingham) eventually narrowing the list of cities to two, Phoenix and Indianapolis. In January 1984, Baltimore mayor Schaefer stated, \\"We're not going to build a new stadium. We do not have the bonding capacity. We don't have the voters or taxpayers who can support a $60 million stadium. One-third of the people in Baltimore pay taxes. Unless private enterprise builds it, we won't build it.\\" The Phoenix Metropolitan Sports Foundation, headed by real estate developer Eddie Lynch, along with Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt and other top Arizona officials, had secretly met with Irsay early in January 1984. Preliminary talks seemed promising. Phoenix was offering a below market rate $15 million loan and rent-free use of the 71,000-seat Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University. A second meeting was scheduled between Irsay and the Phoenix group. But when word of a second scheduled meeting leaked out and was reported by the media on the Friday before the Super Bowl, Irsay canceled. In January 1984, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced that expansion had been put on hold. As a result of that announcement, Indiana Pacers' owner Herb Simon contacted Colts officials in order to take negotiations between the club and Indianapolis to the next level. Mayor Hudnut then assigned deputy mayor Frick to begin secret negotiations with Colts counsel Michael Chernoff. On February 13, Colts representatives came to town to look at the Hoosier Dome construction. Colts owner Robert Irsay visited on February 23. \\"He [Irsay] was visibly moved,\\" former deputy mayor Dave Frick said commenting on Irsay's reaction to entering the brand new domed stadium. \\"Emotionally, he was making the move.\\" Meanwhile, in Baltimore, the Maryland General Assembly became involved in the dispute. On March 27, 1984, the Maryland Senate passed legislation giving the city of Baltimore the right to seize ownership of the Colts by eminent domain, an idea first floated in a memo written by Baltimore mayoral aide Mark Wasserman. Irsay said that his move to Indianapolis was \\"a direct result\\" of the eminent domain bill. Chernoff said of the move by the Maryland legislature: \\"They not only threw down the gauntlet, but they put a gun to his head and cocked it and asked, 'Want to see if it's loaded?' They forced him to make a decision that day.\\" =March 29, 1984= Maryland Governor Harry Hughes signed a bill allowing the city of Baltimore to seize the Colts by eminent domain, it was too late to prevent the organization from moving to Indianapolis. On March 28, 1984, the Phoenix group withdrew its offer, citing the Maryland Senate's actions. That afternoon, Irsay called Mayor Hudnut; the city of Indianapolis offered the Colts owner a $12.5 million loan, a $4 million training complex, and the use of the brand new $77.5 million, 57,980-seat Hoosier Dome. Irsay agreed. After he got off the phone with Irsay, Hudnut called his neighbor and friend, John B. Smith. Smith was the chief executive officer of Mayflower Transit, an Indiana-based moving company; Hudnut asked him to help the team move. Smith sent 15 Mayflower trucks to Owings Mills, arriving at the Colts' facility at around 10 p.m. Irsay and Hudnut wanted to move quickly because they feared that the Maryland House of Delegates would approve and Maryland Governor Harry Hughes would sign the eminent domain bill, allowing the state to seize the team the following morning. Workers loaded all of the team's belongings and the trucks left for Indianapolis. Within eight hours of the Mayflower trucks' arrival in Owings Mills, the Colts were completely gone from Baltimore. Later that day, the House of Delegates did indeed pass the bill by a count of 103‚Äì19 and Governor Hughes signed it, but by that time it was too late. The fifteen moving trucks took different routes to Indianapolis from Baltimore as a diversion tactic so that the Maryland State Police could not delay them until after the eminent domain law was signed. As each truck reached Indiana, the Indiana State Police met it and escorted it to Indianapolis‚Äîa process repeated until all fifteen vans had reached the destination. Indianapolis Mayor Hudnut held a press conference on March 29 to announce the agreement. On March 30, the Capital Improvement Board, which operated the Hoosier Dome, agreed to the deal. Two days later, 20,000 new Colts fans cheered as Mayor Hudnut proclaimed March 29, 1984, \\"one of the greatest days in the history of this city.\\" Baltimore's Mayor Schaefer appeared on the front page of The Baltimore Sun in tears. After the Colts left, and in spite of his earlier stance that the city of Baltimore would not build a new stadium, he placed the building of a new stadium at the top of his legislative agenda. Later John Moag, Jr., chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, stated in sworn testimony before the U.S. Senate subcommittee responsible for the Fan Freedom and Community Protection Act: \\"It was the failure of our local (Baltimore) and state elected officials in Maryland to provide the Colts with a firm proposal for a new stadium that led Mr. Irsay to accept an offer from Indianapolis to play in a new dome in that city.\\" Aftermath Not only were Baltimore Colts' fans heartbroken about losing their team, but they also lost the team name. (The Colts had been named in honor of the city's Preakness Stakes and Maryland's horse farmers.) In elections that year, city voters repealed Question P by a vote of 62 percent to 38 percent. However, the amendment's author (Hyman Pressman) remained as an elected City Comptroller for 28 years (seven terms in a row) until retiring in 1991. Representatives of Baltimore and the Colts organization reached a settlement in March 1986 in which all lawsuits regarding the move were dismissed, and the Colts endorsed a new NFL team for Baltimore. The Colts' move prompted city and state officials to redouble efforts to retain Baltimore's remaining major-league team, the Orioles. Oriole Park at Camden Yards, a facility designed specifically for baseball, was constructed near the proposed Baltodome site and opened in 1992. Its retro-classic design was well- received and inspired the designs of new MLB stadiums for the next twenty years. One aspect that remained in Baltimore was the Baltimore Colts Marching Band. According to an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary called The Band That Wouldn't Die, directed by Baltimore native Barry Levinson, band leaders received advance warning that the team was being moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis overnight and were able to remove their equipment from team headquarters before the moving vans arrived. At the time of the move, the band's uniforms were being dry-cleaned. Band President John Ziemann contacted the owner of the dry cleaners, who was sympathetic, the latter told Ziemann where the uniforms were and offered to let Ziemann take the company van \\"for a walk\\". Ziemann and some associates then hid the uniforms in a nearby cemetery until the wife of then-Colts owner Robert Irsay said they could keep them. From 1984 until the NFL returned to Baltimore in 1996, the band stayed together, playing at football halftime shows and marching in parades, eventually becoming well known as \\"Baltimore's Pro-Football Musical Ambassadors\\". The band remained an all-volunteer band as it is today and supported itself. At one point, Ziemann pawned his wife's wedding ring for the money to buy new equipment. Colts Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas, who had settled with his family in Baltimore after his playing career was over, was angered by the move to Indianapolis and cut all ties with the team. Unitas aligned himself with the Ravens when they moved to Baltimore, and a statue of him was placed outside of M&T; Bank Stadium. 2012-13 playoffs See also * Relocation of professional sports teams * History of the Baltimore Colts * History of the Indianapolis Colts * The Band That Wouldn't Die References Relocation Category:Indianapolis Colts Category:National Football League controversies Category:National Football League franchise relocations Category:1984 in sports in Indiana Category:1984 in sports in Maryland ","title":"Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis"},{"id":"26708306","text":"RBG-Azimuth (GDC-Azimuth') was a quarterly Ukrainian blingual (Russophone and Ukrainophone) science fiction magazine, published since 2006.

In 1968, Gamal became the first raqs sharqi dancer to perform at the Baalbeck International Festival. She also appeared at the Cairo Opera House and danced for King Hussein and the Shah of Iran. Gamal toured Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and North America during her career. In 1978 and 1981 she briefly taught dance workshops in New York City. Later in her career, Gamal started a school of dance. Gamal was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990, and while undergoing treatment in Beirut contracted pneumonia and died. Style and influence Gamal was known for her extensive use of floorwork. She also often included raqs baladi (folkloric dance), Bedouin dances and ZƒÅr dance with raqs sharqi in her performances. She influenced many dancers such as Ibrahim Farrah, Suhaila Salimpour, and Claire Naffa.

With a 217-seat theater, the Clinton Showboat has produced musicals and comedies for 21 years.  History  =Original construction= The original boat was built in 1936 by the Dravo Corporation near Pittsburgh and named ‚ÄúOmar.‚Äù She was created as a working boat, a coal- fired towboat for the Ohio River Company. Primarily steel, the boat is 207 feet long, 36 feet wide, and 37¬Ω feet high. In the water, it displaces 581 gross tons. The oaken paddlewheel, rebuilt in 1980, is approximately 32 feet in diameter. It was powered by two Marietta compound stem wheel engines that required 25 to 75 tons of coal a day. These engines produced 1,000 horsepower. For 25 years, ‚ÄúOmar‚Äù pushed barges up and down the Ohio River. In 1962, the Ohio River Company donated the boat her to the State of West Virginia for use in its centennial celebration. =Renovation= The State of West Virginia converted the towboat into a showboat. The builder preserved the main deck, lounge and second deck captain‚Äôs quarters . The original galley area and crew‚Äôs quarters became the theater. By raising the pilothouse, the builders created a new third deck, providing theatre balcony and museum exhibition space. The pilothouse retained the captain‚Äôs control wheel and the high view of the river. The new showboat was renamed ‚ÄúRhododendron,‚Äù the West Virginia state flower. =Purchase by City of Clinton= On September 15, 1966, the City of Clinton, Iowa, purchased the ‚ÄúRhododendron‚Äù from the state of West Virginia at a public bid price of $21,165. A week later, the boat began its 1,600 mile journey from Morgantown, WV to Clinton. It was towed down the Monongahela River to Pittsburgh, then down the Ohio to Cairo, IL, then up the Mississippi River to Clinton. Moored at Riverfront Park in Clinton, the City used the boat as a floating theatre. =\\"City of Clinton\\"= In 1975, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of new flood control dike on the Clinton waterfront. This forced the showboat to relocate for the next five years. When the showboat returned to Clinton in 1980, it was rechristened ‚ÄúCity of Clinton‚Äù After its return to Clinton, the ‚ÄúCity of Clinton‚Äù was pulled out of the river and permanently installed on the new dike. This move was intended to protect the boat from winter damage in the river and make it more accessible to the public. At the same time, the exterior of the boat was painted and the interior refurbished. =Lillian Russell Theater= In 1980, the theater on the \\"City of Clinton\\" was named the \\"Lillian Russell Theater\\" in honor of the Clinton-born actress, Lillian Russell. In 1940, the film biography of Russell was shown in Clinton as a world premiere. At that time, the city commissioned a brass plaque to commemorate that event. That plaque was installed in the Lillian Russell Theater. In 1983, the Clinton Park Board and the Showboat Advisory Board decided to create its own theater company for the \\"Lillian Russell Theater\\". In previous years, the boards had been paying outside theater companies to stage plays and the move was considered more cost efficient. The boards hired an artistic director and founded the Showboat Players. The first performance was in the summer of 1984. =Clinton Area Showboat Theater = In 1988, a new nonprofit group was incorporated to run the Lillian Russell Theater ‚Äì Clinton Area Showboat Theater (CAST). By 1989, had leased the theater. The City converted the showboat museum into a theater shop. The City also replaced the boilers and converted the front portion of the main deck into a waiting area. In 1989 and 1990, this waiting area was used as a rehearsal space for the Showboat Players. =1990's additions= In 1991, the City rebuilt the entire first deck of the \\"City of Clinton, removing all the small motors, generators, and pumps. A ticket office for the Mississippi Belle II casino boat was constructed in the forward section of the first deck along with a new CAST box office and a concession stand. The City also installed air conditioning and heating on the first deck, in the theater and in the dressing rooms. In 1992, the City installed a handicap elevator and created a wheel chair seating area in the back of the theater. In 1995, the City built a handicap ramp to the second deck. With Mississippi Belle II, The Iowa Department of Criminal investigation and the Iowa Gaming Commission moving off the Showboat, CAST now has complete use of the Showboat, moving the box office to the area of the Gaming Commission and the Artistic Director‚Äôs office along with the Production Stage Manager‚Äôs office to the area vacated by the DCI. The old box office was removed to give more space across from the concession stand. =2000's Remodeling= In 2006, the City installed a new fire control system, a new fire exit sign and a new air conditioning system. The exterior of the \\"City of Clinton\\" and its paddle wheel were painted. Later in the decade, the theater received new carpeting, new wooden flooring, and new seats. everything.http://summer-stock.org/?page_id=130 In June 2016, a proposal was discussed in the Clinton City Council to repaint the exterior of the boat again due to chipping and rust. Producing Artistic Director In 2014, CAST hired Matthew Teague Miller as the new producing artistic director. Teague had previously directed the musical Les Mis√©rables at the neighboring Timber Lake Playhouse. Miller has a BFA in Musical Theatre from University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music and an MFA in Directing from University of North Carolina Greensboro.http://www.matthewteaguemiller.com Notes Category:Theatres in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Clinton, Iowa Category:Tourist attractions in Clinton County, Iowa ","title":"Clinton Area Showboat Theatre"},{"id":"26708528","text":"Bergen Teknikersamfund (Bergen Technician Society) is a student organisation at Bergen University College in Bergen, Norway.

Description This is an aquatic perennial growing from a creeping rhizome that anchors in wet substrate. It produces thin, cylindrical, heavily branching stems usually less than a metre in length. The submerged leaves are sessile, relatively narrow, typically 40‚Äì90 mm long and 5‚Äì12 mm wide along the main stem but smaller on the side branches. They are translucent and pale green with a white midrib, and finely toothed. Floating leaves are more oval in shape, 20‚Äì70 mm long by 7‚Äì34 mm wide, and borne on long petioles. The inflorescence is a short spike of many flowers arising from the water on a stout peduncle. This species readily hybridizes with many other species of Potamogeton. Hybrids have been recorded with P. perfoliatus (P. √ó nitens Weber), P. lucens (P. √ó angustifolius J.Presl.), P. natans (P. √ó sparganiifolius Laest. ex Fr.), P. coloratus (P. √ó billupsii Fryer), P. maackianus (P. √ó biwaensis Miki), P. illinoensis (P. √ó spathuliformis (J.W.Robbins) Morong), P. richardsonii (P. √ó hagstromii A.Benn.), P. alpinus (P. √ó nericius Hagstr.), P. nodosus (P. √ó lanceolatifolius (Tiselius) C.D.Preston), P. oakesianus (P. √ó mirabilis Z.Kaplan, Hellq. & Fehrer) and P. polygonifolius. In Britain, P. x nitens and P. x angustifolius are quite common. Recent molecular analysis has shown that Swedish collections of the putative hybrid P. gramineus x P. polygonifolius are in fact P. gramineus x P. nodosus. A triple hybrid, P. gramineus √ó lucens √ó perfoliatus (P. √ó torssandrii (Tiselius) D√∂rfler), is also known. As well as hybridising frequently, various-leaved pondweed is an extremely variable plant and care should be taken with its identification. Taxonomy Potamogeton gramineus (gramineus meaning 'grasslike') was one of the original species named by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum (1753). However, due to its highly variable nature and propensity for hybridisation, various-leaved pondweed has received a bewildering number of synonyms. DNA analysis indicates that P. gramineus is one of the broad-leaved pondweed clade (section Potamogeton) and is probably most closely related to the P. lucens group. Distribution Potamogeton gramineus is native to much of the Northern Hemisphere, with a Holarctic distribution. It occurs in northern Europe (Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, France, Poland, Russia, the Baltic States), Greenland, North America (USA except for the southeast, Canada). There are outlying populations in southern Europe (Iberia, Corsica, Italy), Caucasus, Pyrenees and western USA. Various-leaved pondweed, Potamogeton gramineus, in a garden pond. Ecology and Conservation Various-leaved pondweed grows in various water body types including ponds, lakes, bogs, ditches and streams. It is usually restricted to shallower water <1 m deep, though it has been recorded growing at more than 5 m depth in very clear, oligotrophic water in Llynnau Cregennen, Wales. It is intolerant of nutrient pollution and is not usually found in base-poor water of alkalinity less than about 200 ueq l‚àí1. The roots penetrate to a depth of about 10 cm. In Michigan streams, P. gramineus is restricted to riffles with warmer interstitial temperatures. Grazing by waterfowl can have a significant effect on various-leaved pondweed. In Sentiz Lake (Leon, Spain), P. gramineus was sparse and the dominant plants were Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spicatum. However, within experimental cages from which waterfowl were excluded, P. gramineus became co- dominant and developed both flowers and floating leaves. In Britain, it has shown the same pattern of decline as other broad-leaved pondweeds such as P. praelongus and P. alpinus, with most losses occurring in southern Britain, and is now classed as near threatened in England. This likely reflects increasing eutrophication, canalization of rivers leading to loss of backwater habitats and other floodplain standing waters, and degradation or loss of pond and lake habitats. P. gramineus may also grow in open reedbeds, and the loss of traditional reed cutting practices may have caused the loss of populations from this habitat. It is Critically Endangered in the Czech Republic, Endangered in Germany, Flanders and Switzerland, Near Threatened in the Netherlands, and scarce and of conservation importance in Spain. Local extinction has also been recorded in Lower Saxony between 1948 and 1986. In the US, P. gramineus is listed as Threatened in Illinois and Endangered in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Indices of environmental tolerance using trophic ranking schemes in Europe tend to show P. gramineus to be one of the more nutrient-sensitive aquatic plants. Studies in the Netherlands show P. gramineus to be associated with Littorelletea lakes, and to be one of a suite of species sensitive to acidification. Various-leaved pondweed is one of the so-called Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion'. However, in Britain P. gramineus also occurs in waters with lower nutrient concentrations and is considered a characteristic species of mesotrophic lakes. Cultivation Potamogeton gramineus is not in general cultivation, though it is an attractive plant and grows well in a garden pond or barrel. Its slower growth than most submerged species, attractive leaves and habit of producing a limited number of floating leaves make it very ornamental and suitable for garden ponds, and its smaller size than many other pondweeds is also a benefit. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes.

The fight ended in a victory for the United States after North Korean forces attempting to assault the US position were blocked and repelled repeatedly, suffering heavy casualties. Reeling from the Hadong Ambush and being driven from the city of Chinju, the United States Army's 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division scrambled to protect the pass into Masan, the final South Korean city before the Naktong River, where the UN was holding its Pusan Perimeter in place. North Korean and US forces unexpectedly ran into one another and a confused battle ensued. American forces were better equipped with heavy weapons and armor thanks to newly arrived equipment in the country, and their better ground during the battle allowed them to repel North Korean advances. The North Korean force eventually withdrew after several unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was disengaging from Masan, United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns as they were retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. This fight, with a number of smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.  Background  = Outbreak of war = Following the outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of Korean People's Army (KPA) advances, delaying much larger KPA units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive. The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the KPA, making time for the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position. Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the KPA's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, being almost completely destroyed but delaying KPA forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day. = North Korean advance = With Taejon captured, KPA forces began the effort of surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it. The KPA 4th and the 6th Divisions advanced south in a wide maneuver. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. They advanced on UN positions pushing back US and South Korean forces repeatedly. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by KPA forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces. Reeling from the loss, UN planners hastily moved reserve forces to the southwest to repel North Korean advances. Several US infantry regiments as well as the command post of the 24th Infantry Division moved to establish new positions to prevent KPA forces from advancing from Chinju. American forces moved to defend the city of Masan, the last key city before the KPA reached the perimeter. Located in the mountainous region along South Korea's southern coast, Masan was accessible by two routes from the west. Major General John H. Church, the 24th Infantry Division's commander, emplaced the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 27th Infantry Regiment in the area to defend Masan. Eventually, the 27th set up along the southern entrance while the 19th Infantry covered the north, in a pass known as \\"The Notch,\\" southwest of Chungam-ni. The entire 19th Infantry Regiment, reeling from the fight at Chinju and attempting to hold back North Korean advances, fell back to the Notch.  Battle  The 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry was assigned to hold the Notch and the high ground on the right flank, to the northwest. Republic of Korea Army (ROK) troops led by Colonel Min would hold the high ground to the southwest of the Notch. Meanwhile, 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry withdrew to reserve positions at the northern base of the pass. During the evening of July 31, 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry also arrived in the region. More importantly, A Company of the 8072nd Medium Tank Battalion, armed with M4 Sherman medium tanks rebuilt in Japan, arrived at Masan, some of the first heavy armor the UN had in the war. One platoon of A Company's tanks went to the 27th Infantry in the south while the 19th Infantry in the north got the other half. This put the force of the 19th Infantry and supporting units at 2,335 under the command of Colonel Ned D. Moore, excluding the South Korean forces. M20 recoilless rifles in action. These weapons were used at the Notch against North Korean machine gun positions The number of North Korean forces committed to the region is not known, however later research suggests that the KPA 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, and it is likely that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the number of KPA involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000. = Attack = At 06:45 on August 2, C Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry began to move out from its positions on a reconnaissance patrol supported by tanks and armored cars. Before the armored column left the lines, it ran head-on into a North Korean attack starting on the Notch, as mortar fire and three heavy machine guns opened up on it from below the crest of the pass. The road before the pass erupted into a frantic and confused struggle, C Company in the lead was struck with machine gun fire, killing most of its 1st Platoon before the men could disembark from their trucks. American soldiers who dove for cover in the ditches along the road found KPA soldiers already in cover there. The lead M4 was struck with mortar fire and destroyed, while anti-tank weapons set at least one American truck on fire. During this fight, advancing KPA troops captured at least a few of the surprised American soldiers, using them as human shields when advancing up the high ground where the rest of the UN force was firing down at them. In the end, the initial ambush cost the Americans about 30 casualties. C Company overcame several North Korean attempts to cut them off before withdrawing back to the American lines. American forces were quick to counter the attack. M20 recoilless rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, KPA forces were quick to advance up the Notch, to the crest of the hill that made up the pass. There, they discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as KPA forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when USAF aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed. ROK forces, meanwhile, had emplaced in the wrong position, too far south, and were not in contact with 19th Infantry. The ROK forces were subsequently hit with friendly and enemy fire, and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block the South Koreans from advancing, thinking them enemy forces. North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate the rear of the position and kill five UN soldiers with shots to the back of the head. However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank. The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the KPA for the first time, and were crucial in pushing back each attempted KPA advance. North Korean infantry, unsupported by armor of their own, suffered heavy casualties from the American forces in their positions on the high ground. = North Korean withdrawal = Fighting at the Notch continued through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the Notch. In the meantime, they set up roadblocks to prevent further KPA attacks from moving down the road. KPA forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall they were out of the region. In the meantime, the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large KPA column advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, USAF planes mounted an airstrike and inflicted heavy casualties.  Aftermath  The American forces reported 57 killed, 37 wounded, 17 missing and 6 captured, for a total of 117 casualties from the 19th and 29th Infantry Regiments. This number was far lighter than casualties for other unit actions of similar size so far in the war. North Korean casualties are unknown but believed to be far heavier than the American force. Actions in the Notch, as well as attacks on the region for the next few days are known to have largely destroyed the KPA 6th Division, and over 50 percent of its force became casualties in the fighting. The fight was one of the first victories for UN forces in the war. In stopping the North Korean advance at the Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of the KPA 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the UN forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day. The KPA defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when the KPA began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.

The general commanding the Air Force gives him the mission to stop Nicholas (Hartley Power), an American posing as an archaeologist, but involved in drug trafficking. Nicholas has the help of an Arab sheikh, whose caravans crisscross the desert. During a patrol, Jack intercepts one of these caravans without finding anything. Just then, an aircraft piloted by a beautiful aviator, Anita Rogers (Anna Lee) lands nearby. Back in Cairo, Jack is sure Anita has something to do with the criminal activities, and follows her. Jack manages to steal a suitcase that a stranger gives to Anita. After a chase among the pyramids of Gizeh, suitcase turns out to contain only cigarettes. The escapade makes headlines and Jack feels the wrath of the general's anger. Shortly after, Anita, who has fallen in love with Jack, apologizes and offers to help Jack by playing the role of the Sheikh's wife while Jack pretends to be the sheikh. While disguised as Arab, Jack offers Nicholas the chance to sell him hashish. The pretense is uncovered when the real Sheikh arrives. A fight ensues with Jack managing to knock out the two drug traffickers. Jack and Anita, with Nicholas slung over a horse, are pursued by the sheikh's men. Jack and Anita take refuge in the ruins of a fort, where they are soon besieged but manage to warn Cairo, thanks to a passenger pigeon. The general immediately sends aircraft and troops to help them. With the drug smugglers put away, Jack and Anita plan their happy future.

While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as genetics, neuropsychology, and evolutionary psychology.Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate. Approaches =Environment= Environment has a significant effect on genetic expression. Disadvantaged environments enhance antisocial gene expression, suppress prosocial gene action and prevent the realization of genetic potential. =Genetics= One approach to studying the role of genetics for crime is to calculate the heritability coefficient, which describes the proportion of the variance that is due to actualized genetic effects for some trait in a given population in a specific environment at a specific time. The heritability coefficient for antisocial behavior is estimated to be between 0.40 and 0.58. The methodology often used in biosocial criminology (that of twin studies) has been criticized for producing inflated heritability estimates, though biosocial criminologists maintain that these criticisms are baseless. Criminal justice researchers Brian Boutwell and J.C. Barnes argue that many sociological studies that do not control for genetic inheritance of risk factors have misleading or unreliable results.Is crime genetic? Scientists don't know because they're afraid to ask = Neurophysiology = Another approach is to examine the relationship between neurophysiology and criminality. One example is that measured levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine have been associated with criminal behavior. Another is that neuroimaging studies give strong evidence that both brain structure and function are involved in criminal behaviors. The limbic system creates emotions such as anger and jealousy that ultimately may cause criminal behavior. The prefrontal cortex is involved in delaying gratification and impulse control and moderates the impulses from the limbic system. If this balance is shifted in favor of the limbic system this may contribute to criminal behavior. Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime argues that \\"life-course-persistent offenders\\" make up only 6% of the population but commits more than 50% of all crimes and that this is due to a combination neurophysiological deficits and an adverse environment that creates a criminal path that is very difficult to break once started. = Evolutionary psychology = Men can potentially have many children with little effort; women only a few with great fun/effort. One argued consequence of this is that males are more aggressive, and more violently aggressive, than females, since they face higher reproductive competition from their own sex than females. In particular, low-status males may be more likely to remain completely childless. Under such circumstances, it may have been evolutionarily useful to take very high risks and use violent aggression in order to try to increase status and reproductive success rather than become genetically extinct. This may explain why males have higher crime rates than females and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. It may also explain why the degree of income inequality of a society is a better predictor than the absolute income level of the society for male-male homicides; income inequality creates social disparity, while differing average income levels may not do so. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.Aurelio Jos√© Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman. The evolutionary psychology of criminal behaviour. In The \\"evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory\\" focuses on the hormone testosterone as a factor influencing aggression and criminality and being beneficial during certain forms of competition. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens in correlation with the rise of testosterone levels. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by lumbar puncture, which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used less reliable measurements from blood or saliva. Some studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. A significant link between juvenile delinquency and testosterone levels has not been established. Some studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as antisocial behavior and alcoholism. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship. Many conflicts causing homicides involve status conflicts, protecting reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation (\\"honor\\"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important. Some cultures place greater emphasis on protecting honor than other cultures. One explanation is that protecting honor was in the ancestral past relatively more important for herders than for farmers. The livestock of herders were easily and quickly stolen. As a result, it was important to constantly show toughness as a deterrence, which may cause a higher level of violence. The predictions of the theory was confirmed in a cross-cultural examination of traditional farming and herding Spanish-American societies. However, the prediction that sedentary fishing societies would place a low emphasis on honor was not confirmed. The degree of cultural collectivism is strongly associated with the burden of infectious disease. It has been argued that this is due to collectivism and associated characteristics such as out-group avoidance limiting the spread of infectious diseases. Other characteristics such as strong in-group‚Äìout-group bias and willingness to defend the ingroup's honor may promote violence. A study found strong associations between several forms of violent criminal behavior and both infectious disease rates across U.S states and degree of cultural collectivism across U.S. states. The associations remained strong after controlling for income inequality.  Specific forms  Evolutionary psychology researchers have proposed several evolutionary explanations for psychopathy. One is that psychopathy represents a frequency-dependent, socially parasitic strategy. This may benefit the psychopath as long as there are few other psychopaths in the community since more psychopaths means increasing the risk of encountering another psychopath as well as non-psychopaths likely adapting more countermeasures against cheaters. Sociobiological theories of rape are theories that explore to what degree, if any, evolutionary adaptations influence the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures. The Cinderella effect is the alleged higher rate of stepchildren being abused by stepparents as compared to genetic parents, observed in some, but not all, studies. An explanation of this affect has been attempted by application of evolutionary psychology theories. There have also been various criticisms of these theories.Daly & Wilson (2007) Is the \\"Cinderella Effect\\" controversial? In Crawford & Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Infanticide is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross- cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success, in which case it would decrease the mother's inclusive fitness to spend resources on the child, in particular since women generally have a greater parental investment than men.  Criminal justice  Punishment of exploitative behaviors harmful to the group was likely a recurring problem in the ancestral environment. As such humans are argued to have developed a range of psychological mechanisms for handling this. Punishment can be a deterrent to undesired behaviors but excessive punishment can also be harmful to the group. Thus, human are argued to favor a proportional response based on how severe the offence is. Cross-cultural research have a found a high agreement regarding how relatively harmful different crimes are perceived to be. On the other hand, evolutionary novel factors that may be rational to consider from a deterrent perspective, such as how difficult it is for the modern police to detect the crime, do not seem to affect people's perceptions of appropriate punishments.Michael Bang Petersen. The evolutionary psychology of Mass Politics. In Once a crime's severity has been judged, there is a choice regarding how to respond. In some cases in the ancestral environment there may have been benefits from future interactions with the offender which some forms of punishment may have prevented as compared to responses such as reparations or rehabilitation. Research suggests that individuals may modify what they think are appropriate forms of response to offenders based on factors that once in the past small-group environment may have indicated that they could personally benefit from continued interactions with the offender such as kinship, in-group or out-group membership, possession of resources, sexual attractiveness, expressed remorse, intentionality, and prior history of cooperation and exploitation.

Pantoja de la Cruz portrayed also other English and Scottish aristocrats traveling to and from Spain, leaving paintings now in some English stately homes. Life The family was originally Italian, and its members extended through Europe, from Flanders to Spain. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V awarded them positions as heads of public lodgings (Hostes) and postal offices (postas). Johann Baptist von Taxis was the head of the Reichspost. His oldest son, Raymond de Tassis (circa 1515 - 1579), went to Spain and became postmaster general of the kingdom. Raymond married Catalina de Acu√±a (circa 1515 - 1579). Juan de Tassis was his son and heir. Under king Philip II of Spain he was in the service of the unfortunate Prince Don Carlos, who died as a teenager. He participated in the war fighting the Morisco revolt in Granada and in North African towns such as Oran, now in Algeria. He was made a Knight of the Military Order of Santiago, serving the 3rd Duke of Alba in the conquest of Lisbon, Portugal, 29 June 1581. While he was there, his only son, Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana was born. In 1583 Tassis returned to Madrid with the king. He was created the 1st Count of Villamediana by king Philip III of Spain on 12 October 1603, confirming him as Correo Mayor, or Head of the Postal Communications within the Spanish Empire. He was married to Maria de Peralta Mu√±atones. In June 1603, Tassis headed a Spanish-Flemish delegation which visited London to seek an end to the war with England which had begun in 1585. Elizabeth had recently died and her successor James I quickly sought to end the long and draining conflict with Spain which he inherited. Therefore, the Peace Treaty was successfully signed on 28 August 1604. Tassis died in 1607 and was buried at the Principal Chapel of the Convento de San Agust√≠n, Valladolid. His son, Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana, assassinated in 1622, inherited the Villamediana title and the position of head of the Imperial Posts. References *Otis H.

In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, mining gave a revenue of , tourism NOK 317 million and research 142 million. In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK 494,700, or 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution. The Spitsbergen Treaty and Svalbard Act established Svalbard as an economic free zone and demilitarized zone in 1925.Arlov (1996): 319  Food  = Agriculture = =Fishing and hunting= Svalbard has historically been a base for both whaling and fishing. Norway claimed a exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Svalbard in 1977, with of internal waters and of EEZ. Norway retains a restrictive fisheries policy in the zone, and the claims are disputed by Russia. = Brewing = Establishing a brewery on the Svalbard archipelago required a change of Norwegian law, which prohibited commercial production of alcoholic beverages there until 2014. Svalbard Bryggeri established production of several beers in Longyearbyen in 2015, after the law was changed. 16% of the water used for brewing are thawed ice from the 2,000 year old Bogerbreen glacier. The brewery claims to be the northernmost brewery in the world.N√• tappes verdens nordligste √∏l p√• Svalbard NRK July 31, 2015 Taxation The Spitsbergen Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of providing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fisheries surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard. The treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment. Mining Since the resettlement of Svalbard in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to power the power station in Longyearbyen. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. Tourism Tourism is centered on Longyearbyen. Activities include hiking, kayaking, walks through glacier caves and snow-scooter and dog-sled safari. Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic, including both stops by offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard. Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August; overnights have quintupled (from 1991 to 2008), when there were 93,000 guest- nights. The world's northernmost blues festival, Dark Season Blues, is an annual event in late October in Longyearbyen, and marks the beginning of the dark season when daylight and the sun is about to leave Svalbard for four long winter months. Norway announced in February 2012 that, in order to protect the islands from the danger of a ship running aground and possibly causing an oil spill within a pristine fjord, it would implement a requirement for cruise ships to carry a licensed pilot in order for the ship to enter any of the islands' fjords. Many of the fjords on Svalbard are quite dangerous, with strong torrents and narrow fairways. The pilot requirement will be phased-in gradually. Starting in 2012, all vessels going to the Svea coal mine had to carry a pilot. Starting in 2013, all passenger vessels over 150 meters had to have a pilot when going into one of the fjords on Svalbard. And starting in 2014, all boats over 70 meters and all passenger vessels longer than 24 meters needed to have a pilot when entering one of the fjords.BarentsObserver.com, 21 February 2012; \\"No more pilot-free sailing around Svalbard\\"; accessed 25 FEB 2012.

She is a member of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management and a Chartered Environmentalist. In her early professional career, in 1984, she compiled the first draft of the ancient woodland inventory for West Sussex. After working for the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group she worked for Cobham Resource Consultants, later part of the Scott Wilson Group, as an ecological consultant, where her interests in the white clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes and signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus began. As an independent crayfish researcher her research has concentrated on the protection of the UK native white clawed crayfish and restricting the invasion of the alien signal crayfish. Peay is a leading proponent of crayfish conservation and management in Britain and has produced much of the guidance on crayfish used by British ecologists and managers on survey and monitoring methods, restoration of habitat, mitigation during works on waterbodies, and, latterly, on \\"ark sites\\" to safeguard white-clawed crayfish. She also provides advice and training for organisations such as the Wildlife Trusts, Environment Agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, BBC and others. As invading signal crayfish are a major threat to native crayfish, both in Britain and in Europe, Peay has studied the effects of signal crayfish on white clawed crayfish and their environment, particularly on native fish stocks, and has researched control and eradication methods. She represents The Wildlife Trusts on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group for white clawed crayfish, is a board member of the International Association of Astacology and has contributed to the European CRAYNET programme.

The film, based on a 2006 book, presents real-life espionage-convicted Arne Treholt as the leader of a ninja group saving Norway during the Cold War and stars Mads Ousdal as Treholt. The film is loosely based on the story of Norwegian politician and diplomat Arne Treholt, who in 1985 was convicted of high treason and espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and Iraq. In 2006, Thomas Cappelen Malling wrote the book Ninjateknikk II. Usynlighet i strid 1978 (\\"Ninja Technique II: Invisibility in combat 1978\\"). The book was presented as a military manual written by Treholt in 1978. It achieved a certain cult status, and was considered a success at 5,000 units sold. Plot The story, set during the Cold War, involves the conflict between the Norwegian ninjas, King Olav V's secret army tasked to maintain Norway's independence, and a clandestine stay-behind group who carry out false flag operations that get blamed on Communists. Cast *Mads Ousdal as Arne Treholt *Jon √òigarden as Otto Meyer *Trond-Viggo Torgersen as King Olav V *Linn Stokke as Ragnhild Umbraco *Amund Maarud as Bumblebee *Martinus Grimstad Olsen as Black Peter *√òyvind Venstad Kjeksrud as √òystein Fjellberg *Henrik Horge as Kusken Production In December 2008 it was announced that the Norwegian Film Institute would support a film made by Cappelen Malling with NOK 10.5 million, in spite of the fact that the author had no previous experience from the movie industry. The book forms the basis for the film, where an alternative universe-Treholt leads a group of ninjas set up by then- King Olav V to combat the Soviets. The original working title was Nytt norsk h√•p (\\"New Norwegian Hope\\"), and the total budget was NOK 19 million. The producers describe the story as taking place directly before Treholt's arrest in 1984, presenting \\"the true story of how Commander Arne Treholt and his Ninja Force saved Norway during the Cold War.\\" Cappelen Malling himself describes the film as \\"alternative history\\", but only in the sense that all history is alternative. Treholt himself has allegedly given his consent to both the book and the movie. The absurd premise of the film secured a great deal of media attention for it ahead of its release. Aftenposten, in January 2010, predicted it would be one of the most absurd works of Norwegian cinema. Verdens Gang quoted producer Eric Vogel, saying \\"Something like this has never been made in Norway before. Or in the world, as far as I know!\\" They also interviewed Mads Ousdal, who portrayed Treholt in the film, describing the role as very different from anything he had done previously. Comedian Trond Viggo Torgersen played the part of King Olav V. Reception Although the movie was not a big box-office success, it did receive some very good reviews. J.S.

Critical reception Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Clive Moragan called Orangutan Diary and \\"engrossing series\\", describing it as \\"soap-style wildlife documentary series\\". Daily Express said that viewers of the show would be, \\"touched and amazed in equal measure\\". Writing in The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe questioned if the show was actually good for the orangutans, stating, \\"They even blow soap bubbles for the nursery class, with the babies following them through the air with just as much rapt wonder as any human infant. But given that people are the biggest threat to orang-utans in the wild, you couldn't help but wonder whether being taught to fear and distrust us might be more to the point.\\" See also *Orangutan Island *The Disenchanted Forest *The Burning Season References External links * * Category:Documentary films about nature Category:BBC television documentaries Category:2007 British television series debuts Category:2009 British television series endings Category:Nature conservation in Indonesia Category:Orangutan conservation Category:Films about apes ","title":"Orangutan Diary"},{"id":"26708975","text":"Fabio Semenzato (born 6 May 1986 in Treviso) is an Italian rugby union player.

It was installed on Victory Day of May 1985 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Red Army's victory in the German- Soviet War. The monument was designed by architects Vladimir Lukyanov and A. I. Alymov. The Hero-City Obelisk is pentahedral in shape; its cross section has the shape of a star.http://www.visit-petersburg.ru/en/showplace/194715/ In its lower part, the Obelisk is encircled with a bronze wreath covering the joint of the two monoliths. The monument is decorated with bronze high reliefs devoted to the heroic defence of Leningrad while a gold star shines on its top. After the Alexander Column, it is the highest stone monument in Saint Petersburg. When Soviet forces eventually lifted the siege in January 1944, over one million inhabitants of Leningrad had died from starvation, exposure and German shelling. 300,000 soldiers had perished in the defence and relief of Leningrad. Leningrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1945, being the first city to receive that distinction. Installing the obelisk required highly skilled builders and fitters. Grey granite resembling the colour of soldier's overcoat was chosen to make the body of the monument. The rock was obtained from a quarry of the Vozrozhdenie (literally: Revival) deposit near the town of Vyborg. On 6 November 1983, a monolith weighing 2200 tonnes was separated from the source rock with the help of a controlled explosion. The finishing touches and polishing of the granite were done on the site. In early April 1985, the Obelisk crowned with the \\"Gold Star\\" was installed onto its pedestal.  Principal dimensions  The total height of the obelisk is 36 meters. It consists of a crowned top and a central trunk of height 22.5 meters, pommel and Star ‚Äî 4.5 m. and base ‚Äî 9 m. Its base has a diameter of 3.5 meters and a width of 9 meters. The overall mass of the monument is approximately 390 tonnes. The total mass of the monument with the base is 750 tonnes. The diameter bronze wreaths is 4.5 meters while that of the Gold Star at its top, which is made of stainless steel, is 1.8 meters.–õ–∏—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –í.–ì. –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥.–≤ 2—Ç.–¢.2,–û—Ç –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫–∏ –∫ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏.-–°–ü–±.:–ö–æ–ª–æ,2009.584—Å.,—Å—Ç—Ä.482.

As such, \\"Moluccans\\" is used as a blanket term for various ethnic and linguistic groups inhabiting the islands. The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Melanesian, or Papuan, in origin. However, the migration of the Austronesian people changed the situation. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population around 2000 BCE. Later added to were some Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English genes due to colonization and marriage with foreign traders in the Middle Ages or with European soldiers during World War. Small number of German descendants added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 15th century. A small population of Moluccans (~45000) live in the Netherlands. This group mainly consists of the descendants of KNIL soldiers who had originally planned to come the Netherlands only temporarily, but were eventually forced to stay. (See Moluccan diaspora.) The remainder consists of Moluccans serving in the Dutch navy and their descendants, as well as some who came to the Netherlands from western New Guinea after it was handed over to Indonesia.Beets et al., Demografische ontwikkeling van de Molukse bevolkingsgroep in Nederland However, the vast majority of Moluccans still live in the Moluccas and the other surrounding regions such as Papua, West Timor, North Sulawesi, Bali and Java. History Sukarno dancing with Moluccan people, 1958. After the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during World War II, the Netherlands wanted to restore the old colonial situation. The indigenous Indonesians were against it. However, led by rebels and Sukarno, a struggle for independence broke out between 1945 and 1949. The reconstituted Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) was commissioned by the Dutch government to maintain order and to disarm the rebels. Moluccan professional soldiers formed an important part of this army. The Moluccan community was thus regarded by the Dutch as allies and vice versa. The government of the Netherlands had promised them that they would get their own free state in return for assisting the Netherlands. After international efforts could not support the Netherlands to maintain its colony, the Dutch government could no longer keep its promise to the Moluccans for a free state. The Moluccans, who were seen by the Indonesians as collaborators, had to go to the Netherlands. Moluccans who served in the command of KNIL would reside temporarily in the Netherlands. The Moluccans were then housed in camps in the Netherlands, including the former Westerbork transit camp. The Dutch Moluccans had repeatedly drawn the attention of the Dutch government to their claim for a free Republic of South Maluku (Republik Maluku Selatan or RMS) state of which the Dutch government had promised earlier. In the 1970s this escalated more and more. One of the methods to gain attention on the matter was through the violent hijackings of 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis in De Punt, Wijster, where hostages were taken, and the train hijackers were killed. Language The Moluccans speak over a hundred different languages, with a majority of them belonging to the Central Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. An important exception is the North Moluccan island of Halmahera and its vicinity, where the majority of the population speak West Papuan languages (North Halmahera branch), possibly brought through historical migration from the Bird's Head Peninsula of New Guinea. Another exception are the Malay-based creoles such as the Ambonese language (also known as Ambonese Malay), spoken mainly on Ambon and the nearby Ceram; and North Moluccan Malay used on the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera and Sula Islands in North Maluku. Moluccans living in the Netherlands mostly speak Ambonese and Buru. Religion The Moluccans in the northern Moluccas (present province of North Maluku) are mainly Muslim. and the Moluccans in the central and southern Moluccas (present day Maluku) are mainly Christians. The religions that are most often espoused by Moluccans in the Netherlands are the Protestant faith and, to a lesser extent, Islam. There are significant number of native Hindu followers in Kei Islands although the region is predominately Catholic.

It stars Mammootty, Nedumudi Venu, Lalu Alex, Suresh Gopi, Sumalatha, Lakshmi and Murali. Plot Justice T. Vasudev (Babu Namboothiri) is murdered in his house, and after his death Coir (coconut fibre) is pushed into his mouth by the murderer. One of his close friends, businessman Kuwait Mani (M. G. Soman), seemed to be quite upset with this murder. Days later, Kuwait Mani is killed in an intentional car accident. After his death too, coir was inserted in the mouth. Police Superintendent Haridas Damodaran (Mammootty) heads the investigation. He orders his sub-ordinate Joy (Lalu Alex) to collect details of similar murder cases from history. It is found that Rosario Fernandes (Devan), who was found to have poisoned himself to death also had coir in his mouth. The police had not thought this significant, as it was something that a victim might do in his last moments after consuming poison. The investigation later reveals that all of the victims were college classmates, and the next target is expected to be Philip Thennalackal George (Murali), who is a businessman. Investigations lead them to suspect \\"Christy\\" (Suresh Gopi), who was the son of Rosario Fernandes and Sreedevi Rosario (Lakshmi). Sreedevi had died bed-ridden owing to a disease. Haridas captures further information about Christy by meeting Sreedevi's father C. K. Gopala Menon (Prathapachandran), that he was behaving abnormally of late and now his whereabouts are unknown. From Nurse Leeladevi (Kaviyoor Ponnamma), it was also traced that Christy was present in mysterious circumstances when Sreedevi died in the hospital. On roughly questioning Philip, he reveals that they (Vasudev, Mani, Philip and Rosario) all had a longing for Sreedevi in their college days, but she didn't bother about them. When an opportunity came, they had gang raped her. During an event Haridas meets the chief guest Warrier (Nedumudi Venu) who is a spiritual leader having devotees all around the world. Later, Warrier locked in someone in his house and called on Hari for help. Warrier claimed the stranger tried to kill him and an encounter between Hari and the stranger took place in which the stranger narrowly escapes. Police are able to trace and arrest Christy on murder charges, and he is returned to the mental asylum he had escaped from. While undergoing treatment there, Haridas transfers Christy to the police hospital citing better treatment and caring. Christy is subjected to Narcosynthesis, from it Haridas gets that Christy has been misled by someone, who is most likely responsible for the crimes. Later Christy escapes from this hospital which threats Haridas' job. Philip calls in the police for protection, but Haridas doesn't give him. Haridas and Joey watch Philip's home to catch the unknown culprit. It turns out that the perpetrator was Warrier, because during college time Sreedevi was initially his wife and the trio raped her in front of him. Aftermath he was under treatment for mental problems and set off for pilgrimage. When he came back to the city and settled, he saw everyone who hurt him was happy and nothing wrong has happened to them. So he set out himself to dish out justice.

History =Service history= Cheonan was launched in November 1989 from Korea Tacoma Marine Ind., Ltd., Masan, South Korea. The ship's primary mission was coastal patrol, with an emphasis on anti-submarine operations. Cheonan was one of the ships involved in the First Battle of Yeonpyeong in 1999. It is also known that the ship suffered slight damage on the stern in the First Battle of Yeonpyeong. The ship had been scheduled for decommissioning in 2019. =Sinking, recovery and aftermath = Sinking On 26 March 2010, an explosion occurred near the rear of Cheonan, causing the ship to break in two. The cause of this explosion was not immediately determined. The 1,200 tonne ship started sinking at 21:20 local time (12:20 UTC) about off the south-west coast of Baengnyeong Island in the Yellow Sea. The island is located on the South Korean (ROK) side of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto boundary dividing South from North Korea (DPRK). The ship had a crew of 104 men at the time of sinking, and a total of 58 crew were rescued. Another 46 crew were unaccounted for. Cheonans captain, Commander Choi Won-il, said that the ship broke into two and the stern sank within five minutes after the explosion and while he was still assessing the situation. On 17 April 2010, North Korea denied any involvement in the sinking of Cheonan. Baengnyeong Island (red) Sinseong, a sister ship of Cheonan Rescue efforts Initially six South Korean navy and two South Korean coast guard ships assisted in the rescue as well as aircraft from the South Korean air force. It was reported on March 27 that hopes of finding the 46 missing crew alive were fading. Survival time in the water was estimated at about two hours and large waves were hampering rescue attempts. The ship sank in 45 meter deep waters with a small portion of the overturned hull still visible above water. It was expected that it would take up to 20 days to salvage the ship.South Korea rules out navy ship sunk by North Korea, Reuters, Jo Yonghak, 27 March 2010 During the course of the search and rescue effort over 24 military vessels were involved, including at least three US Navy vessels, , , and . On 30 March 2010 it was reported that one South Korean naval diver (ROKN UDT/SEAL CWO Han Ju-ho) had died after losing consciousness whilst searching for survivors and another had been hospitalised. On 3 April 2010, South Korean officials said that a private fishing boat involved in the rescue operations had collided with a Cambodian freighter, sinking the fishing boat and killing at least two people, with seven reported missing. The same day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that one body of the 46 missing sailors had been found. Later on 3 April 2010 South Korea called off the rescue operation for the missing sailors, after families of the sailors asked for the operation to be suspended for fear of further casualties among the rescue divers. The military's focus then shifted towards salvage operations, which were predicted to take up to a month to complete. Recovery On 15 April 2010, the stern section of the ship was winched from the seabed by a large floating crane, drained of water and placed on a barge for transportation to the Pyongtaek navy base. The same crane raised the bow portion of Cheonan on 24 April 2010. The salvaged parts of the ship were taken to Pyongtaek navy base for an investigation into the cause of the sinking by both South Korean and foreign experts. The unsalvaged parts were left to break apart. Cause of sinking On 25 April 2010, South Korea's defense minister, Kim Tae-Young, said that the most likely cause of the explosion that sank Cheonan was a torpedo; his statements were the first time that a South Korean official publicly cited such a cause. Kim said that \\"A bubble jet caused by a heavy torpedo is thought to be the most likely thing to be blamed, but various other possibilities are also under review.\\" A bubble jet is caused by an underwater explosion which changes the pressure of water, and whose force can cause a ship to break apart. The bubble jet theory was supported by one of the investigators into the incident, who had said that there was no evidence that an explosion had occurred in contact with a ship, and that a non-contact explosion had most likely broken the ship in half. On 20 May 2010, a South Korean-led international commission investigating the sinking of Cheonan presented its findings, stating that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack. The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May, which include 5x5 bladed contra- rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. The markings in Hangul, which read \\"1Î≤à\\" (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo. However, some (The Hankyoreh) have pointed out without the proper reason that in the North, \\"Ìò∏\\" (pronounced \\"ho\\") is most often used rather than \\"Î≤à\\"; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking \\"4Ìò∏\\". Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods. However, an expert at a South Korean missile manufacturer disagreed with the idea that the submarine alleged by ROK authorities to have shot the torpedo actually has the capability: \\"Sango class submarines are known to be used by North Korean commandos in infiltrating areas or laying mines, but they apparently do not have an advanced system to guide homing weapons. If a smaller class submarine was involved, there is a bigger question mark.\\" One member of the investigative team, Shin Sang-cheol, who would be summoned on charges of spreading unsubstantiated rumors, publicly expressed doubts by saying \\"The magnified photo of the evidence showed that the marking was written on the rusted surface. If it were the North who marked it, the marking should have been written on a smooth surface.\\" The Ministry of Defense had earlier tried to remove Shin from the investigative team, saying that \\"He is not qualified to work as part of the investigation team, as he has been spreading malicious rumors, as well as lacks expertise and has been insincere in his participation in the probe.\\" On 13 September 2010, the final report was issued by JIG which concluded that, \\"The Cheonan was split and sunk due to a shockwave and bubble effect generated by the underwater explosion of a torpedo. The detonation location was three meters to port from the center of the gas turbine room and at a depth of 6-9 meters...\\" North Korea denied that it was responsible for the sinking. China dismissed the official scenario presented by South Korea and the United States as not credible. An investigation by the Russian Navy also did not concur with the report. On 9 July 2010, the United Nations Security Council made a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker.

Political career Crosby was first elected to Town Council in 1968 and was first elected as Mayor in 1988. During his early years in office, the town was experiencing a difficult time economically as it lost its largest employer, Dominion Textiles and in 1990 the Canadian National Railway ceased to operate. Crosby responded by advancing a plan to bring jobs to the town by turning the closed Rio Algom tin mine into a home for Halifax Regional Municipality's waste, but the plan met strong opposition from environmentalists. Since then, the centre of town was refurbished and the area became centered on the tourist trade. Notable accomplishments during Crosby's tenure as mayor included the construction of Mariners Centre arena, revitalization of the waterfront, improvements to the water and wastewater treatment systems, development of Starrs Road as a commercial district, and the construction of a new Town Hall.

History Model A was officially formed in 2000 out of the remnants of a previous project that Brennan Rose had assumed since 1997 called 057. With the departure of the past members of 057 in 2000, Rose turned to bulletin boards at a local college in efforts to continue the project. He soon met vocalist Brandon Schilling who arrived at the audition with guitarist Patrick Wilson. With the addition of Schilling and Wilson and then in October, Eric Miranda on keyboards the first line-up was complete. This was the first defined sound of Model A, which at that time had no bassist but used keyboards widely as a foundation for the bass. The band released two limited edition works, 2001's The Stir EP and 2002's Pilots of Radiowaves, under the band's own label First Modulation Records. In 2002 while recording Pilots of Radiowaves, Miranda left the group and later was replaced by Erik Christiansen on keyboards. Meanwhile, the band had a revolving door of bassists that never seemed to fit the band's style. Finally in 2003, bassist Thierry Sertyn was an instant fit and Christiansen subsequently left, leaving Rose to handle programming the keyboards for Model A's first full length. During this time Model A met John Sonderegger and formed a friendship after seeing Sonderegger's Atomic Prism Lightshow, and the visuals were to become a staple of Model A's live show thereafter. Their first major LP, Transmission: Lost was released mid-2004 under the subsidiary vanity title, Model A Music. In 2005, Model A released Chic as a single for their spring US tour. A fall tour followed, but by 2006 while recording a second full-length record, Sertyn announced his departure, making Model A a trio once more. In 2007, following a their last Spring tour, Model A's progress halted due to internal issues. In 2008, Schilling and Wilson officially departed from Model A, and Rose decided to continue the project alone. After a search, Sean Cobb joined Model A following a chance meeting on Halloween night. Name origins The name Model A stemmed from the band's desire to create their own unique sound that was unlike any group that they had heard before. This urge was to in essence form a new model for their music and to create an environment that fostered musical exploration, democracy, and equality in the decision making process. That model became \\"Model A\\" as it was the first attempt for the original members to work in this manner.

The Employer Brand, Bringing the Best of Brand Management to People at Work, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester.Mosley, R. (2015) Harvard Business Review. The term was first used in the early 1990s, and has since become widely adopted by the global management community.Minchington, B (2010) Employer Brand Leadership ‚Äì A Global Perspective, Collective Learning Australia.Martin, G (2009) Employer Branding and corporate reputation management, The Peak Performing Organisation, Chapter 13, pp 252, Routledge, London.Edwards, M. R., (2010), An integrative review of employer branding and OB theory, Personnel Review Vol. 39, No.1, pp.5-23 Minchington describes employer brand as \\"the image of your organization as a 'great place to work' in the mind of current employees and key stakeholders in the external market (active and passive candidates, clients, customers and other key stakeholders). The art and science of employer branding is therefore concerned with the attraction, engagement and retention initiatives targeted at enhancing your company's employer brand.\\" Just as a customer brand proposition is used to define a product or service offer, an employer value proposition (also sometimes referred to as an employee value proposition) or EVP is used to define an organization's employment offering. Likewise the marketing disciplines associated with branding and brand management have been increasingly applied by the human resources and talent management community to attract, engage and retain talented candidates and employees, in the same way that marketing applies such tools to attracting and retaining clients, customers and consumers.Mosley, R. (2014) Employer Brand Management, Practical Lessons from the World's Leading Employers,Wiley. Origin The term \\"employer brand\\" was first publicly introduced to a management audience in 1990,Barrow, S. (1990), 'Turning recruitment advertising into a competitive weapon', Paper delivered at the CIPD Annual Conference, Harrogate, UK. and defined by Simon Barrow, chairman of People in Business, and Tim Ambler, Senior Fellow of London Business School, in the Journal of Brand Management in December 1996.Ambler, T and Barrow, S. (1996), The employer brand, Journal of Brand Management, Vol. 4, pp. 185-206. This academic paper was the first published attempt to \\"test the application of brand management techniques to human resource management\\". Within this paper, Simon Barrow and Tim Ambler defined the employer brand as \\"the package of functional, economic and psychological benefits provided by employment, and identified with the employing company\\". By 2001, of 138 leading companies surveyed by the Conference Board in North America, 40% claimed to be actively engaged in some form of employer branding activity.Dell, D and Ainspan, N (2001), Engaging employees through your brand, Conference Board Report No. R-1288-01-RR, April, Conference Board, Washington, D.C. In 2003, an employer brand survey conducted by the Economist among a global panel of readers revealed a 61% level of awareness of the term \\"employer brand\\" among HR professionals and 41% among non-HR professionals.The Economist (2003), Employer Branding Survey. The first book on the subject was published in 2005, and the second in 2006.Minchington, B (2006) Your Employer Brand ‚Äì attract, engage, retain, Collective Learning Australia. In 2008, Jackie Orme, the Director General of the UK Chartered Institute of Personnel Directors confirmed the growing status of the discipline in her opening address to the CIPD annual conference, with the observation that: \\"When I started out in the profession, nobody talked about employer branding. Now it's absolutely integral to business strategy‚Äîresonating well beyond the doors of the HR department\\". Similar recognition of the growing importance of employer brand thinking and practice has also been recently in evidence in the USA,Sartain, L and Schumann, M. (2006), Brand from the Inside, John Wiley & Sons, San Francisco. Australia, Asia,Baid, P and Rao, A.R.

Growing Importance of Employer Branding  A candidate's market, combined with new consumer behavior, has led to the rise in importance of employer branding as a Human Resources and Marketing Discipline. The market has shifted since the great recession in favor of candidates given low unemployment. This means that employers are fighting over the same small pool of candidates to fill their open roles, especially in hard to fill areas like data scientist and other STEM based roles. Moreover, consumer behavior has changed the way that people look for jobs. The candidate journey isn't simply a job seeker finding your job and applying. This is especially true of the best candidates - they want to research a company and build a relationship with it over months before applying for a job. This creates a dynamic where companies who invest in employer branding are seeing lower cost per hire and time to fill.  Review Sites  Just as sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor have sprung up to review restaurants and hotels, there is a menagerie of websites dedicated to allowing current, past, and future employees to review employers. While companies can encourage their employees to leave reviews, the reality is that many of these sites are populated by former employees who've had a bad experience. This is evidenced by the average Glassdoor rating of 3.3https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/glassdoor- myth-busters/, whereas an Uber rating below 4.6https://qz.com/1038285/uber- will-make-riders-explain-when-they-rate-a-driver-below-five-stars/ will result in a driver being let go. This difference is driven by everyone rating in the case of Uber, versus a more biased group reviewing employers. Beyond encouraging employees to leave reviews, employers can also pay a fee to have sponsored profiles on each of these review sites which allows them to post job ads, and add employer branding related content, amongst other ways of controlling their profile.  Employer Branding ROI  Similar to brand advertising, the return on investment from employer branding efforts can be hard to measure. Many companies struggle with ways to measure the money saved or earned from efforts such as creating a culture video, having a better career site, or developing talent pipelines. The simplest ways of measuring a return on employer branding investment are: # Increased awareness that leads to more applicants, and tracking how these applicants translate to hires # Increased conversion rates of interested applicants after implementing employer branding tactics # Decreases in time to fill, and the progress this allows a business to make # Decreases in third party recruiter spend  Employer Branding and Tools  There are now an emerging group of tools that can assist HR and Marketing teams in their employer branding efforts. Some of these tools were originally designed for marketing purposes. Others are existing HRTech that have evolved to have employer branding capabilities such as the newer generation of applicant tracking systems and job boards. There is also a small group of software providers that focuses explicitly on employer branding such. Employer brand management Employer brand management expands the scope of this brand intervention beyond communication to incorporate every aspect of the employment experience, and the people management processes and practices (often referred to as \\"touch-points\\") that shape the perceptions of existing and prospective employees. In other words, employer brand management addresses the reality of the employment experience and not simply its presentation. By doing so it supports both external recruitment of the right kind of talent sought by an organisation to achieve its goals, and the subsequent desire for effective employee engagement and employee retention. Employer brand proposition As for consumer brands, most employer brand practitioners and authors argue that effective employer branding and brand management requires a clear Employer Brand proposition, or Employee value proposition. This serves to: define what the organisation would most like to be associated with as an employer; highlight the attributes that differentiate the organisation from other employers; and clarify the strengths, benefits and opportunities of the employment offer. Internal marketing Internal marketing focuses on communicating the customer brand promise, and the attitudes and behaviours expected from employees to deliver on that promise.Papasolomou, I and Vrontis, B (2006), 'Using internal marketing to ignite the corporate brand', Journal of Brand Management, Vol 14, Nos 1/2, pp177-195.Kotler, P. et al (2005), Principles of Marketing, Fourth European Edition, Pearson, Harlow, England. While it is clearly beneficial to the organisation for employees to understand their role in delivering the customer brand promise,Mitchell, C. (2002), 'Selling the brand inside', Harvard Business Review, Vol.80, No.1, pp99-105. the effectiveness of internal marketing activities can often be short-lived if the brand values on which the service experience is founded are not experienced by the employees in their interactions with the organisation.Mosley, R (2007) 'Customer experience, organisational culture and the employer brand', Journal of Brand Management, Vol 15, October Issue pp123-134. This is the gap that employer brand thinking and practice seeks to address with a more mutually beneficial employment deal / Psychological contract. Brand-led culture change Compared with the more typically customer centric focus of Internal marketing, internal branding / brand engagement takes a more 'inside-out', value-based approach to shaping employee perceptions and behaviours, following the lead of the highly influential 'Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies' study published in the mid-1990s.Collins, J and Porras, J, (1995), Built to Last, Random House, UK. This sought to demonstrate that companies with consistent, distinctive and deeply held values tended to outperform those companies with a less clear and articulated ethos. While brand-led culture change is often the stated desire of these programmes their focus on communication-led, marketing methods (however, involving or experiential) has been prone to the same failings of conventional internal marketing.Martin, G. and Beaumont, P. (2003), Branding and People Management, CIPD Research Report, CIPD, London.Machtiger, B. (2004) 'Beware the pitfalls that kill branding efforts' Marketing News, Vol.38, No.4, pp21. As Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, asserts: \\"One of things you find in companies is that once a culture is formed it takes nuclear weaponry to change it\\".Smith, S. and Wheeler, J. (2002), 'A new brand of leadership', Managing the Customer Experience, FT Prentice Hall, UK. You cannot simply assert your way to a new culture, no more can you assert your way to a strong brand, it needs to be consistently and continuously shaped and managed, which is one of the primary reasons many organisations have turned from the short term engagement focus of internal branding initiatives to more long term focus of employer brand management.  Use  Strategic in nature with a focus on the whole employee lifecycle from hire to retire, employer branding can also become a medium to hire. It can be used to hire through employee referral or referral recruitment.

The Women's National War Relief Association was an American relief organization founded during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War to give comfort to the officers, soldiers and sailors in the United States Military. The women founding the association used the group as a means for women \\"to supplement with material aid the sacrifices of time, strength, and life made by the men of the nation\\" during the military conflict. Founding of Women's National War Relief Association The Women's National War Relief Association was incorporated at Albany, New York on May 31, 1898. According to a report in The American monthly review of reviews, its president was Mrs. General U. S. Grant, its director-general Mrs. Ellen Hardin Walworth, and its assistant director-general Helen Miller Gould. The board of vice-presidents comprised the wife of the Attorney-General, Mrs. John W. Griggs, along with the wives of the governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming,Illinois, Virginia, Wyoming, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio, North Dakota, Kentucky, Alabama, Oklahoma, Georgia, Idaho, Washington, New Mexico, Oregon, Montana, Arkansas, South Dakota, West Virginia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. The constitution was adopted in May 1898. Activities The early work of the Association included fitting out the ambulance ship Relief with a carbonating plant, electric fans, canvas awnings, food, and medical supplies, and Fortress Monroe was provided with ten chefs and 10 of assistants to assist with meals. Nine nurses were sent to Fortress Monroe from July 9 to October 10. The association made a monetary contribution of $100 a week for the convalescent table. Three thousand dollars was distributed through official channels to aid in the equipment of the ambulance ships Relief, of the War Department, and Navy Department ship, Solace. Hospital supplies were sent to the United States Marine Corps at Santiago. After the close of the war $2,500 worth of supplies were sent to Santiago, and also a steam launch, at a cost of $1,600, was supplied for the yellow-fever hospital about two miles from Santiago.

Set in the fictional town of San Pedro in Chiapas, the program centers on two young adults, Lucrecia C√≥rdoba Pedraza (Maite Perroni) and Juli√°n Huerta Almada (Eugenio Siller), whose love is opposed by their families as the result of a tragic childhood accident that claimed the life of Lucrecia's brother, C√©sar. The novela follows the trials and tribulations that keep the young couple apart, as well as Lucrecia's less-than-warm relationship with her mother, Rosario (Daniela Castro), and the shattered relationship of childhood best friends Paulino C√≥rdoba (Roberto Bland√≥n), Rodolfo Huerta (Francisco Gattorno), and Gabino Roura (Sergio Goyri) that results from C√©sar's death and Rodolfo's adulterous wife, Justina Almada (Sabine Moussier). The main cast consists of approximately twenty characters and is supplemented by several minor characters. Main characters =The C√≥rdobas= *Paulino C√≥rdoba Valencia (Roberto Bland√≥n) is the owner of the hacienda \\"El Milagro\\", an apple orchard, as well as the husband of Rosario Pedraza; the father of their two children, Lucrecia and C√©sar; and the childhood friend of Rodolfo Huerta, Gabino Roura, and Mat√≠as Quiroga. Paulino desires to make his hacienda as impressive as possible for the day when he anticipates that his son will take over, believing that Lucrecia, as a girl, is not suited for the business world of men. Paulino's dreams are shattered when C√©sar drowns at the age of nine, and again some months later when Rosario miscarries their unborn son. He dearly loves his daughter, but he sends Lucrecia away to boarding school because he can see that Rosario has forgotten how to love her. Before marrying Rosario, Paulino dated Justina Almada, who is now married to his best friend Rodolfo, and the two later had an adulterous affair that resulted in the birth of Justina's son, Josu√©, which Paulino discovered upon learning that the two shared the rare blood type B-. The memory of his affair with Justina creates a terrible feeling of guilt within Paulino that nearly destroys him. Paulino eventually dies near the end of the series of smoke inhalation as the result of a fire set by Sim√≥n M√©ndez, who was sent by Carmelo. *Rosario Pedraza de C√≥rdoba (Daniela Castro) is the snobbish, but devoutly religious wife of Paulino C√≥rdoba and the mother of their two children, Lucrecia and C√©sar. Rosario has always preferred C√©sar to Lucrecia because he is male and showers attention upon him while treating Lucrecia coldly, even sometimes hatefully. She is destroyed by her son's death and is again devastated when, less than a year later, she miscarries the son whom she had intended to name Francisco. Rosario blames Lucrecia for the death of both of her sons and orders Paulino to send their daughter away, which he does. In addition to blaming Lucrecia, Rosario also faults Juli√°n Huerta for C√©sar's death, slapping him and calling him \\"El Chamuco\\" (the devil) at C√©sar's wake, a nickname that unfortunately sticks to the young boy. Upon Lucrecia's return to San Pedro, Rosario does everything in her power to keep her from being with Juli√°n and schemes to have her daughter marry Carmelo Roura. At the end of the series, Rosario finally admits the real reason that she has always hated Lucrecia: her daughter is also simultaneously her sister, the result of her rape at the hands of her own father. Rosario finally accepts her daughter and newborn grandson, but she commits suicide in the river where C√©sar died in the final episode. *Lucrecia C√≥rdoba Pedraza (Maite Perroni, Daniela Aedo) is the daughter of Paulino and Rosario and the sister of C√©sar. When the program begins, Lucrecia is a sweet, docile nine-year-old who has practically been raised by the family's maid, Delfina, following her mother's rejection. Lucrecia shares a blossoming romance with the lower class Juli√°n Huerta, but they are torn apart when Lucrecia's mother Rosario faults him for her brother C√©sar's tragic death. After Rosario suffers a miscarriage after falling down the stairs while accosting Lucrecia, Rosario blames Lucrecia for the tragedy, and she is sent away to a boarding school in Oaxaca, Oaxaca, where she is roommates with her cousin, Renata. A decade later, Lucrecia returns to San Pedro a self-confident young woman who rebels against her parents' wishes in order to be with Juli√°n. However, Lucrecia is forced to marry Carmelo Roura in order to save Juli√°n from being wrongly imprisoned; she spends three years unhappily married to Carmelo before Juli√°n returns to San Pedro. The couple reunites, but when Lucrecia tries to leave Carmelo he rapes her, and when she subsequently becomes pregnant she is left unsure of who fathered her child. Lucrecia eventually divorces Carmelo, marries Juli√°n, and gives birth to their son, C√©sar, before living happily ever after with her family. Lucrecia and her brother, C√©sar, are originally said to be twins early in the series, but the revelation that Lucrecia is the product of Rosario's rape creates a retcon so that Lucrecia is C√©sar's older sister. *C√©sar C√≥rdoba Pedraza (Diego Vel√°squez) is the son of Paulino and Rosario and the brother of Lucrecia. Lucrecia and her brother, C√©sar, are originally said to be twins early in the series, but the revelation that Lucrecia is the product of Rosario's rape creates a retcon so that Lucrecia is C√©sar's older sister. One Sunday, while playing by the forbidden river with Lucrecia, Juli√°n, Josu√©, and Manuel, C√©sar attempts to cross the river on a fallen tree trunk following a dare from Josu√© and falls into the water; because he cannot swim, he is swept away by the current and goes over the edge of the waterfall. Although Lucrecia and Manuel tell Rosario otherwise, she blames Juli√°n for C√©sar's death, thus creating the driving force behind the story. *Renata Valencia (Jessica Coch) is the daughter of Paulino's cousin, Alberto. Born in Mexico City, Renata's mother died when she was very young, and her father sent her away to boarding school in Oaxaca, where she is later joined by her cousin Lucrecia. Before graduating, Renata's father commits suicide as a result of his economic problems, leaving his daughter with nothing but her education, which she had squandered. Renata accidentally kills the headmistress in an altercation and flees to San Pedro with Lucrecia, where she becomes obsessed with Carmelo Roura, who has eyes only for Lucrecia. Renata joins up with Rosario to separate Juli√°n and Lucrecia after Rosario promises to provide for her financially, but as a result Lucrecia is forced to marry Carmelo. Renata becomes Carmelo's lover, but he eventually turns against her. Renata makes up with Lucrecia, but she dies in Lucrecia's arms after Carmelo accidentally shoots her. =The Huertas= *Rodolfo Huerta (Francisco Gattorno) is an honest and hardworking school teacher who is married to the ambitious Justina Almada, with whom he has two sons, Juli√°n and Josu√©. Rodolfo loves his wife deeply, but he is unable to provide her with the fabulous lifestyle that she desires and turns to drinking. He eventually learns of his wife's infidelity with his best friend, Gabino Roura, and lashes out at the two, although he and Justina try to rebuild their marriage after Gabino dies and Justina is raped. The couple eventually divorce, however, and Rodolfo is devastated to learn that Josu√© is not his biological son. Rodolfo later meets a divorc√©e with a young daughter, and he forms a happy family with them. *Justina Almada de Huerta (Sabine Moussier) is the ambitious, sensual wife of Rodolfo and the mother of Juli√°n and Josu√©. Justina was with both Paulino and Gabino many years ago but eventually married Rodolfo, a simple school teacher who could give her love and adoration but not the wealthy, fabulous lifestyle of which she had always dreamed. She briefly had an affair with Paulino, which resulted in her youngest son, Josu√©, and then later has a long affair with Gabino. Despite her moral ambiguity, Justina deeply loves her two sons but forbids Juli√°n to be with Lucrecia after the girl discovered her kissing Gabino. She also doubts Juli√°n's innocence in C√©sar's death after Josu√© lies to her and tells her that Juli√°n dared the little boy to cross the river. Years later, Justina's husband and sons scorn her when her affair with Gabino becomes known; after being raped by a stranger, Justina attempts to turn a new leaf, but three years later she is again cheating on her husband. Justina eventually leaves San Pedro, leaving her sons a letter in which she acknowledges all of the harm she had unwittingly done to them, and winds up completely alone, abandoned by her lover. *Juli√°n Huerta Almada (Eugenio Siller, Adriano Zendejas) is the kind, hard-working son of Rodolfo and Justina and the older brother of Josu√©. At twelve years old, Juli√°n had a blossoming relationship with Lucrecia C√≥rdoba, but the two were torn apart after Lucrecia's mother Rosario blamed Juli√°n for C√©sar's death. Juli√°n thus became known as \\"El Chamuco\\" (the devil) and was a virtual outcast in San Pedro for the next ten years. Upon Lucrecia's return from boarding school, the two reunite, but after Juli√°n is blamed for Gabino Roura's murder, Lucrecia is forced to marry Carmelo Roura to save Juli√°n; however, Juli√°n is unaware of the deal and believes that Lucrecia has betrayed him. Juli√°n leaves San Pedro and reunites with his ex-girlfriend, Lorena Mendiz√°bal, returning three years later. Upon learning about their misunderstanding, Juli√°n and Lucrecia eventually reunite, marry, and welcome a son, C√©sar. *Josu√© Huerta Almada (Diego Amozurrutia, Robin Vega) is the son of Rodolfo and Justina and the younger brother of Juli√°n. Josu√© has always been closest to his mother and resented his father and brother's close relationship. Josu√© is hideously jealous of Juli√°n and wants Lucrecia for himself, but after being crippled in a car accident Josu√© decides to become a priest, taking pleasure in the authority that his role gives him. Josu√© eventually learns that his father is not Rodolfo but Paulino, making Lucrecia his half-sister. He subsequently leaves the priesthood and apologizes to his brother for all of his malice. Josu√© ends up with Blanca at the end of the series, and they leave San Pedro together in order to be happy. =The Quirogas= *Father Mat√≠as Quiroga (Salvador S√°nchez) is the priest in San Pedro and the childhood best friend of Paulino, Rodolfo, and Gabino. Mat√≠as watches with sadness as C√©sar's death tears Paulino and Rodolfo apart and becomes a principal advocate for Juli√°n and Lucrecia's love. Following her parents' deaths, Mat√≠as raises his niece Blanca, with whom, thanks to a vengeful lie told by Justina, he is accused of having an incestuous relationship. *Blanca Quiroga (Jackie Garc√≠a) is the sweet and innocent niece of Father Mat√≠as, who has raised her since she became an orphan. The na√Øve Blanca falls for the charms of womanizer Carmelo, sleeping with and becoming pregnant by him. Carmelo refuses to take responsibility for Blanca's condition, and the young woman eventually loses the baby. She develops feelings for Manuel, but after his gentle rejection she falls in love with Josu√©, and they leave San Pedro to be together. =The Rouras= *Gabino Roura Beltr√°n (Sergio Goyri) is an evil and ambitious man who only married his wife, In√©s, for her fortune, and who cares little for his children, Carmelo and Teresa. In the beginning of the series, he murders his wife and continues his affair with his childhood friend Rodolfo's wife, Justina. A businessman, Gabino owns the lands on which Paulino's apple orchard rests. Despite sleeping with Justina, Gabino becomes enamored with Paulino's daughter Lucrecia and desires to marry her, aware that his son, Carmelo, is also obsessed with her. As a result, Carmelo murders his father out of jealousy in episode 48 and frames Juli√°n for the crime. *In√©s Valdivia de Roura (Luc√≠a M√©ndez) is the ill, suffering wife of Gabino and the mother of Carmelo and Teresa. In√©s is slowly dying, unaware that her seemingly caring husband Gabino has been poisoning her for many months. After Justina tells her that Gabino is cheating on her (neglecting to mention the fact that his affair is with Justina), In√©s determines to divorce Gabino, but Gabino murders her at the end of the second episode before she can leave him penniless. *Carmelo Roura Valdivia (Armando Araiza) is the lazy, playboy son of Gabino and In√©s who later becomes the series' primary villain. Carmelo becomes motherless at a young age, and his father's lack of caring towards his two young children transforms him into an irresponsible young man who uses and impregnates the innocent Blanca, then refuses to take responsibility for their child. Despite dating Renata, Carmelo becomes obsessed with Lucrecia and murders his father, his rival, and marries Lucrecia in exchange for keeping Juli√°n out of jail for Gabino's murder. Three years later, Juli√°n returns to San Pedro and begins fighting for Lucrecia; when Lucrecia announces her intention to divorce Carmelo, he rapes his wife. Lucrecia still leaves Carmelo, but she becomes pregnant and is unsure as to whether Carmelo or Juli√°n is the child's father. Carmelo accidentally murders Paulino and Renata in his attempts to regain Lucrecia and is eventually sentenced to many years in prison. *Teresa Roura Valdivia (Gabriela Carrillo) is the cheerful daughter of Gabino and In√©s. Following her mother's death, Tere was primarily raised by the family's maid, Asunci√≥n, and unsuccessfully vied for her father's attention. Tere falls in love with Juli√°n, who has eyes only for Lucrecia, and she eventually decides to help Juli√°n be with Lucrecia. She eventually finds love with Manuel, and they leave San Pedro to escape the sad memories of her family that remain there. =Other main characters= *Delfina Sol√≠s (Magda Karina) is the C√≥rdoba family's maid and the mother of Manuel. Delfina grew up alongside Rosario and eventually served as Lucrecia's wetnurse. Delfina has been like a mother to Lucrecia, who was always rejected by her mother in favor of her brother. In the decade that Lucrecia is away from San Pedro, Delfina marries Modesto, who becomes a loving husband and father to her son, whose father Fidel abandoned her when she was pregnant. *Modesto Flores (Antonio Medell√≠n) is the foreman at El Milagro and the trusted employee of Paulino. Modesto falls in love with Delfina, and they marry in the decade that Lucrecia is in boarding school. He becomes a devoted stepfather to Manuel. *Manuel Sol√≠s (Aldo Gallardo, Alejandro Cervantes) is the son of Delfina and the \\"hermano de leche\\" (brother by milk) of Lucrecia. Manuel has always harbored feelings for Lucrecia, but he supports her in her attempts to be with Juli√°n because he wants her to be happy. He eventually falls in love with Teresa. *Asunci√≥n Torres (Tina Romero) is the Roura family's maid who raised Carmelo and Teresa following their mother's death. She discovers shortly after Gabino's death that her late boss's murderer is none other than his own son Carmelo, but she keeps quiet about his crime out of maternal love. *Lorena Mendiz√°bal (Altair Jarabo) is the ex-girlfriend of Juli√°n and the daughter of Ernesto Mendiz√°bal, one of Gabino's business associates. After Juli√°n leaves San Pedro following Lucrecia and Carmelo's marriage, he and Lorena become involved once more and return to San Pedro engaged three years later. Lorena becomes incredibly jealous of Lucrecia and does everything to keep her away from Juli√°n. After crashing her car in an attempt to kill Juli√°n and Lucrecia, Lorena is left severely disfigured. *Matilde Vda. de Molina (√örsula Prats) is Lorena's aunt. She is a great support to her niece, although she disapproves of Lorena and Juli√°n's relationship and prefers that Lorena be with her nephew by marriage, Miguel. *Ernesto Mendizabal (Sergio Reynoso) is Lorena's wealthy, sensible father who, like Paulino and Gabino, is in the business of producing and distributing apples. After Juli√°n leaves San Pedro and moves to Xalapa, Ernesto takes his daughter's ex under his wing and trains him to take over his business, as Ernesto is very ill and senses that his death is near. Instead of dying of natural causes, however, Ernesto is murdered by Carmelo, who smothers him with a pillow after Ernesto tells Carmelo that Gabino would be disappointed in him, were he still alive. *Fidel Cruz (Gilberto de Anda) is Manuel's biological father, who left San Pedro after getting Delfina pregnant. Upon his return to San Pedro, he becomes a trusted employee of the Rouras, attacking Juli√°n on behalf of both Gabino and later Carmelo. Fidel is recognizable by his frequent use of English phrases, such as \\"take it easy\\", \\"what's happening?\\", and \\"little boss\\" (in reference to Carmelo). He is later shot and killed by Carmelo. *Miguel Molina (Ricardo Franco) is Matilde's nephew by marriage who is in love with Lorena. His aunt supports his attempts to win Lorena because she does not approve of Juli√°n because of his humble roots. *Rita L√≥pez (Mar√≠a Prado) is the owner of a store in San Pedro and is the town gossip. In order to have revenge on Mat√≠as for convincing Gabino to end their affair, Justina tells Rita that she saw Mat√≠as kissing his niece, Blanquita, and Rita proceeds to tell the entire town and to scorn Mat√≠as and Blanca.

The Paul L. Foster School of Medicine is a medical school in El Paso, Texas at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso. The Paul L. Foster School of Medicine is the 9th medical school in the state of Texas, and the medical school is the first one to open in almost four decades. As a result of the numerous financial donations, as well as state funds, The Paul L. Foster School of Medicine has the ability to expand, construct new buildings and hospitals, purchase elaborate training equipment, and hire nationally respected professors. This academic staff is able to train current students through the utilization of state of the art educational and skill enhancing technologies that are considered to be pioneering the medical education process for the next several decades. An example of this ability is demonstrated through the advanced technologies employed in their large Clinical Simulation Center. History In November 2007 The Paul L. Foster School of Medicine celebrated a ribbon cutting for the second of the three buildings that will compose the medical school. This building was the Medical Education Building (MEB) of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. According to their website, the MEB is a four story building with \\"125,000 sq. ft., and includes a student services area, cafeteria, food prep area, classrooms, a library, evaluation areas, small group rooms, clinical skills areas, a simulation room, basic science labs and a gross anatomy lab. The first four-year medical school class is anticipated to be seated in August 2009.\\" Curriculum The Paul L. Foster School of Medicine curriculum is designed in a way where the medical students at the school will take four classes at the same time during their first two clinical science years. These core classes are scientific principles of medicine; society, community and individual; medical skills; and a masters' colloquium. As compared to other medical education programs that stress months of studying microbiology and human anatomy, the curriculum is designed so that students will learn about symptoms such as ear infection, chest pain, shortness of breath, and stomach pain. They will need to identify the cause and the details of each cause and symptom. Through this process the relevant anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, as well as the other traditional subjects will be integrated into the cases presentations of the 120 clinical scenarios. Because the USMLE Step 1 incorporates many clinical vignettes when testing the medical student's knowledge, it is believed that such a curriculum will result in much higher scores per student as compared to other Texas Medical Education Programs. Data regarding this belief will only be available after the first several groups of medical students have been educated through the Paul L. Foster School.

The facility now has approximately 1,200 faculty and staff members. For its first 35 years, only third- and fourth-year medical students, along with residents, could train in the campus's eight accredited programs. However, in February 2008, the school received full accreditation, allowing it to accept first- and second-year medical students into its postgraduate medical training. ‚Ä¢ The curriculum is designed to integrate basic and clinical sciences from the 1st year onward. ‚Ä¢ The Center for Advanced Teaching and Assessment in Clinical Simulation - ATACS is over . This facility is considered state of the art and employs the newest teaching technologies. ‚Ä¢ TTUHSC Paul L. Foster School of Medicine was ranked on the top 10 best cities for medical schools in premedlife magazine. ‚Ä¢ In 1998, TTUHSC El Paso celebrated 25 years serving the El Paso community. The following year, then-Texas Tech System Chancellor John T. Montford shared with the Board of Regents a vision for a full-fledged four-year medical school in El Paso to help alleviate a severe shortage of physicians in the area. Currently, there are less than 110 physicians for every 100,000 people in El Paso. The national average is 198 physicians per 100,000 patients. The Texas average is only 150 per 100,000. Studies have shown that most medical students remain in the region in which they received their education to establish their practices. The addition of the first two years of the medical school would allow students from El Paso and nearby regions to complete their education near home, in hopes of retaining doctors in the area. ‚Ä¢ In 2001, longtime community philanthropists J.O. and Marlene Stewart donated 10.2 acres of land near the HSC for the new medical campus. The Paso del Norte Foundation approved a $1.25 million scholarship grant program for local students contingent on the approval of the four-year medical school. ‚Ä¢ During the 2001 Texas Legislative Session (77th), the El Paso legislative delegation successfully spearheaded an effort to secure $40 million in tuition revenue bonds for the research facility, one of three buildings on the new campus, just a short walk from the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center‚Äîas well as an $11 million clinic expansion project that took about two years, and added a third floor on the present TTUHSC El Paso Medical Center building. ‚Ä¢ In 2002, the Paso del Norte Health Foundation announced a $1.25 million scholarship/grant loan program for TTUHSC El Paso students choosing to practice in El Paso. By working together with TTUHSC, the Foundation would help meet the demand for physicians and provide the perfect environment for area students to improve their medical education, while contributing to the health of our region. ‚Ä¢ In 2003, Texas Governor Rick Perry visited the El Paso campus for a ceremonial signing of House Bill 28, article 10, which authorized Texas Tech to issue $45 million in tuition revenue bonds for the construction of a classroom/office building for a four-year medical school at the El Paso campus. The governor also announced an additional $2 million in funding to finance start-up costs and faculty salaries. ‚Ä¢ TTUHSC El Paso Regional Dean Jose Manuel de la Rosa, M.D., was also appointed by President George W. Bush to the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission, recognizing TTUHSC as a national leader in border health issues. The bi-national commission developed and coordinated actions to improve the health and quality of life along the United States-Mexico border and studied ways to solve the border‚Äôs health problems, a mission that mirrors that of TTUHSC El Paso. ‚Ä¢ On December 9, 2003, the ground breaking for El Paso Medical Science Building I took place, and two years later in January 2006, a ribbon cutting followed. The 93,000 square-foot facility houses research on diabetes, cancer, environmental health and infectious diseases, as well as a repository dedicated to data on Hispanic health and a genomic facility to link hereditary diseases in families.

Life Finnerty was born in Loughrea, the son of a town trader. He moved to Dublin where he became a printer, later publishing The Press, a nationalist paper begun in September 1797 by Arthur O'Connor. Finnerty was closely associated with James MacHugo and Francis Dillon, fellow natives of Loughrea who built the local branch of the United Irishmen. A prosecution by the government against The Press in 1797 resulted in Finnerty being tried for seditious libel: the charge arose from his paper's strong criticism of the judges who sentenced William Orr to death and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Camden, who refused to reprieve him. Despite being defended by John Philpot Curran, he was found guilty in the spring of 1798 and sentenced to two years in prison and a session in the pillory. Despite this, he remained in correspondence with MacHugo.

Some of the recording was done at the school's facilities, some in Siren's apartment using Pro Tools, and some in Cox's apartment bedroom.Stark, Alison, \\"Artist Spotlight - Mankind is Obsolete\\", Regen Magazine, Dec. 9, 2007 By February 2003, a live band had been assembled adding Jamie Roy on bass, Mark Nurre on guitars and Nathan Trowbridge on keyboards and running the light show. Additional recording and mixing was done by Steven Seibold of Hate Dept. and Pigface, and Metamorph was released in August 2003. The songs of Metamorph range from \\"haunting\\" and \\"brooding\\" for much of the album to the faster paced, more heavily electronic and more danceable 'Icarus'. The band toured throughout the west coast and southwest following this album and by late 2004, Roy had left the band. =Rise (2004-2006)= Cox and Siren began working on songs for their first full-length album in 2004Stead, Chris, \\"Mankind is Obsolete\\", Gothic Angst Webzine, accessed Jan. 5, 2010 and in early 2005 brought in Bash as the new bassist. Bash also contributed to writing for that album and served as the producer for Rise, with the band recording it in his home studio. For that album, the band tried to capture more of their live feel by combining live acoustic instruments with electronic and programmed ones. The album has been reviewed as realizing a \\"mature and lucid vision\\", which Siren describes as being about \\"rising above a lot of the battles we were having in our daily lives. It is about seeing the negativity as it is and finding the power within to move past it.\\" Following the 2005 tours which included an East Coast foray to Goth Stock, Trowbridge left the band. Brian DiDomenico was brought on as the new keyboardist in late 2005, just in time to appear in the video for 'Still Right Here', released in February 2006.Rise, Mankind Is Obsolete, cdbaby, accessed Mar. 25, 2010 That year saw a full, nine-week, US/Canada tour supporting Rise. The tour was characterized by performances of such physical intensity that on one occasion Natasha threw out her back on stage and needed emergency room attention following the show. This incarnation of the band saw the creative load spread across the band with all band members contributing to writing new songs 'Awake' (composed for photographer J. Corsentino) and 'Picking at the Scab', both of which would eventually appear on Trapped Inside. =Trapped Inside (2006-2008)= In the fall of 2006, Scott Landes of Collide and Babalon joined the band as a second guitarist, initiating the band's brief, six-member incarnation. In the spring of 2007, MKIO lost Nurre and Bash as the band prepared to record their third album with Sylvia Massy and Jim Wood producing at RadioStar Studios in Weed, California. Landes had previously worked with Massy as part of Collide. He assumed Nurre's guitar duties and they searched for a new bassist for what was shaping up to be a darker album. Joe D'Ambra joined as the new bassist for the Trapped Inside sessions and tour. This album was to involve more extensive contributions from all the band members than previous outings. The album was recorded in July and August 2007 and released that September. While some reviewers found the album to be their best work to date, with a very different sound than Rise,Hunter II, Eric, \\"Mankind Is Obsolete - Trapped Inside\\", Alternative Explosion!, Jan. 30, 2008 others found it entertaining and satisfying, but neither surprising nor progressing much beyond their previous efforts.Y√ºcel, Ilker, \\"Reviews Mankind Is Obsolete Trapped Inside\\", Regen Magazine, Nov. 9, 2007 A more typical reviewer found the album both a mature and experimental work that is \\"very rich\\" and \\"very organic\\", alternating between lush and hypnotic and aggressive and pounding.Eaton, Robert, \\"Mankind Is Obsolete - Trapped Inside\\", Grave Concerns Ezine, July 29, 2008 After Trapped Inside 's September release, MKIO embarked on a year-long U.S. tour. While prospects of supporting the album with a tour that long contributed to Nurre's and Bash's decisions to leave the band, Bash was able to return in March 2008 when D'Ambra decided to leave. D'Ambra parted amicably after eight months with the band, including six months of heavy touring.Johnson, Matthew, \\"Mankind Is Obsolete Announces Remix Contest, New Bassist\\", Regen Magazine, March 4, 2008 A few months later, near the end of the tour, DiDomenico also parted ways with the band. As the tour wound down in August, they played the Warped Tour. =Outside endeavors= Following the Rise tours, band members have occasionally performed with other bands. DiDomenico and Siren formed the live band for Dismantled in its European appearances surrounding the 2007 Wave-Gotik-Treffenvan der Ende, Edwin, \\"Pride and Fall - Amstelveen 2007\\", Reflections of Darkness - A Dark Music Webzine, June 13, 2007 and Siren continues to drum for them live. Cox contributed to the Ikonoklast album The Dawn in 2007. After the Trapped Inside tour, Landes and Siren joined Kidneythieves as part of their live band. In 2009 Siren became the drummer of Psyclon Nine for the recording of We the Fallen and its associated tour. Siren occasionally drums for his former Pseudocipher bandmate, Christopher Anton's solo project, and also drums with System Syn. Bash is also part of the jazz band \\"Magnolia Memoir\\" as well as heads his own eponymous band. Bash, Cox, and Landes debuted the indie/alternative band \\"Alice\\" in early 2010. Following their tour with Android Lust in 2010, Landes began playing guitars with that band.Android Lust - Bio As of 2011, Cox and Siren have appeared as part of the live band for Adam Moore's indie industrial band, InureWard, J., \\"News: Inure hard at work on new material\\", COMA Music Magazine, April 13, 2011 and Cox joined Siren for System Syn's appearance at the 2011 Kinetik Festival. =M√∂bius Loop (2010- )= Work on songs for what would become M√∂bius Loop began soon after the tour supporting the remix album Manic Recession in the fall of 2010, with Siren and Landes starting with the instrumentals. Cox's work on lyrics and vocals followed and a version of \\"Crosshairs\\" made appearances in live performances in 2011. During the album's preproduction, in 2012, they also were named Virtual Music Ambassadors to Iran, and in June 2012 traveled without Siren to Algeria also under the aegis of a U.S. embassy program, for a ten-day workshop with Algerian bands culminating in a battle of the bands performance. By the end of the summer of 2012, the album appeared to be halfway done. 2013 saw some additional shows as tracks were laid down for much of the rest of the album. The album itself was released May 29, 2014 with additional production work and synth tracks by Christopher Jon of Android Lust.

The cultivar has limited to no commercial plantings but is sold as nursery stock for home use in Florida.  History  Dot was originally developed by nurseryman Laurence Zill of Boynton Beach, Florida, and was named after his wife Dorothy. It was reportedly a seedling of the Carrie mango, however a 2005 pedigree analysis by the USDA estimated it was a seedling of the Zill mango. Dot was propagated for several years by the Zill nursery but fell out of favor due to disease susceptibility and lack of ideal color. However, Frank Smathers of Miami, Florida received several cuttings of the Dot and took up propagating the tree, finding the eating quality of the fruit to be very high. The fruit began to be promoted as a popular dooryard cultivar beginning in 1992 at the Fairchild Tropical Garden International Mango Festival, where it has become a featured cultivar several years. Today, Dot is still sold as a dooryard tree in Florida.

This arrangement in bacteria is commonly associated with cis-regulatory elements. Moreover, they are in presumed 5' UTRs of multiple non-homologous genes, suggesting that they function only in these locations. Additional evidence of cis-regulatory function came from the observation that predicted rho-independent transcription terminators overlap pfl RNAs. This overlap suggests that the alternate secondary structures of pfl RNA and the transcription terminator stem-loops compete with each other, and this is a common mechanism for cis gene control in bacteria. pfl RNAs are found in a variety of phyla of bacteria, but are not found in all the species of that phylum. pfl RNAs are common among species of orders Actinomycetales and Clostridiales, the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria and the genus Deinococcus. They are also found in isolated species of Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and deltaproteobacteria. Several lines of evidence led to the hypothesis that pfl RNAs function as riboswitches. First, the above evidence that pfl RNAs correspond to cis-regulatory elements is consistent with most known riboswitches. Second, their relatively complex pseudoknotted secondary structure is typical of riboswitches. Finally, several nucleotide positions are highly conserved despite the large evolutionary distance between species that use pfl RNAs; this high level of conservation is often a consequence of the need to form intricate structures to specifically bind a metabolite. Experimental evidence already supported the hypothesis that pfl RNAs function as cis regulatory elements, before the ligand was confirmed to be ZTP, as well as ZMP (also called AICAR), in 2015. The genes presumed to be regulated by pfl RNAs relate to one-carbon metabolism. Most obviously, for example, formate- tetrahydrofolate ligase synthesizes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. The glyA and folD convert between other one-carbon adducts of tetrahydrofolate. Another gene commonly associated with pfl RNAs is purH, which catalyzes the formylation of the intermediate AICAR in de novo synthesis of purines. The formyl group is taken from formyltetrahydrofolate, and purine biosynthesis is often the dominant user of formyltetrahydrofolate. In similar fashions, if less directly, most pfl RNAs are associated with genes that are directly or indirectly involved in one-carbon metabolism.

The site was carefully chosen so as to be outside the land around Kemble, which was owned by Robert Gordon, who forbade the construction of a public station on his land. The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway (C&GWU;) had been authorised on 21 June 1836 to build a line from a junction with the Great Western Railway (GWR) at to Cheltenham via Kemble, with a branch from the latter point to Cirencester. The first section of the C&GWU; from Swindon to Cirencester opened on 31 May 1841; there were no stations between Minety and Cirencester. A junction was later constructed at , with it, the line from there to was opened on 12 May 1845, and the first station on the new line was at Tetbury Road. A station was also built at the junction, but this had no road access, being intended for interchange purposes. In the meantime, the C&GWU; had been purchased by the GWR on 1 July 1843. During the conversion of the Cirencester branch from 7 ft in gauge to standard gauge, which took place between 22‚Äì27 May 1872, Cirencester passengers used Tetbury Road station, and were conveyed between the station and Cirencester by omnibus.

Roughly half of its original length has been absorbed in the high-capacity Dunkerque-Escaut waterway, as shown on the map, and the remaining length through the port of Lille is often considered as a branch of the main route, hence the alternative names Liaison or Antenne Bauvin-Lys. This official name was never adopted by the local population, which refers simply to the De√ªle, evoking its original state as a natural river, although it has the size and the appearance of a built canal. It is long with 3 locks.  History  Parts of the Deule were made navigable as early as the 13th century, but goods had to be portaged round a natural sill at an island, which gave its name to the regional capital Lille. It was linked with the Scarpe river in the 17th century and the Lys river in the 18th.  Navigation  As with many other small streams in the lowlands of France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the destiny of the relatively short river De√ªle was to become a heavily engineered waterway, to serve the transport needs of industry. However, this construction of a wide and deep channel also serves other functions the value of which is recognized by the EU's Water Framework Directive. 'Heavily modified water bodies' like the successive reaches of the De√ªle form an environment that is worth preserving for overall environmental benefits that are very different from the hypothetical situation where the stream were to be left in its natural state. Navigation is more than ever the principal function, and upgrading of the waterway downstream of Lille is currently proceeding, to provide European Class Vb dimensions, for push-tows of up to 180m long and 12m in beam. The former line of the Canal de la De√ªle remains in water and have been transferred to ownership of the M√©tropole Europ√©enne de Lille (MEL) for development as recreational and recreational assets. A boat harbour is planned in the large basin on the Canteleu arm of the De√ªle, to provide Lille with a facility that will encourage passing boats to stop and spend time in the city.alt=Canal de la De√ªle locationthumb265x265px Route of the Canal de la De√ªle, showing how part of the original canal has now been incorporated in the Dunkerque-Escaut waterway En route The map shows the route.

Originally founded to educate white boys during its first several years, it shifted focus to educating black children after the public education system was established in Pennsylvania. The Adelphi School was sustained through charitable donations, at no cost to its students. The building that housed the school beginning in 1832 is thought to be Philadelphia's \\"last surviving example of a free school building\\". It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  History  In 1807, members of the Philadelphia Quaker community, under the leadership of the minister Thomas Scattergood, founded the Philadelphia Association of Friends for the Instruction of Poor Children to address the educational needs of indigent children in the city. This organization was to consist of no more than forty-five members, all of whom were required to be members of the Society of Friends (i.e., Quakers). The Association intended to build one or more schools based on the Monitorial System of instruction recently developed by Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster. This effort was part of a broader movement within the Quaker community to establish charity schools for the poor prior to the establishment of taxpayer-funded public schools in the United States. The Association obtained funding through private donations and established its first school, for white boys, in 1808. After the first few weeks, the number of students had reached about 90. To accommodate the school's rapid growth, the Association raised $7000 to construct a new building on Pegg Street in the Northern Liberties. In 1809 the school moved into the new facility and began operating under the name \\"the Adelphi School\\". In 1812 the school began instructing girls as well, and they made up about a third of the student population of 330 that year. The school reached its peak enrollment in 1814 with 582 pupils. In 1818, Philadelphia established a public school system, initially for white children only, under the direction of the reformer Roberts Vaux, who had been influenced by the Adelphi School. It was one of the earliest municipal public school systems in the United States. The Association of Friends, believing that the problem of educating poor white children was now being adequately addressed in Philadelphia, closed the Adelphi School that year. The Pegg Street schoolhouse was then rented to the public school system until 1825. The Association thereafter turned its attention to the problem of educating black children in the city, and established a new school on Gaskill Street in 1822. In 1825, the Adelphi School began renting space in a schoolhouse belonging to the Pennsylvania Abolition Society on Cherry Street. In 1831, the Abolition Society decided to reoccupy the space, and the Adelphi School moved to a temporary space while a new dedicated schoolhouse was constructed on Wager Street, now called Spring Street. The 30 by 40 foot, two and a half story brick structure was built for $3100 on a lot purchased for $1200, and the school was opened in 1832. It was constructed in the Federal style, with a simplicity of form characteristic of Quaker architecture. The Wager Street Adelphi School opened in 1832 when the first floor was completed, and the whole structure was finished in 1834. The school originally accepted only school-aged black boys, but expanded to include younger children of both sexes in 1835. In 1838, instruction for the older boys was discontinued in favor of admitting girls. The Adelphi School operated at this location over the next several decades. W. E. B. Du Bois, in his 1899 study The Philadelphia Negro, records its enrollment count at 166 pupils for the year 1847. This had declined to an average of 67 for the period 1873 to 1881. Despite the expansion of the public education system, supporters of the Association believed that the free school still served an important purpose in reaching students who for whatever reason could not attend the public schools. The Association of Friends continued operating the schoolhouse until 1906. From 1908 to 1945, the Abolition Society owned the building. It was used for group activities such as the Boy Scouts and sewing clubs, as well as more formal educational programs. This school operated with the goal of improving \\"the moral, social, industrial and domestic conditions\\" of the African American population of Philadelphia. In 1978, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, in recognition of its architectural, educational, religious, and humanitarian significance. By that point, it was under private ownership and used for commercial purposes.

Sarah Ardizzone's translation won the 2009 Marsh Award. The book was later followed by a sequel, entitled Toby and the Secrets of the Tree. Plot =Part One= A 13-year- old boy named Toby Lolness, who is just one and a half millimetres tall, lives in a civilization nestled in an oak tree. On his seventh birthday, his father, a scientist named Sim, creates a black box that causes one of his toys to move around by harnessing the power of crude sap. However, when Sim refuses to tell anybody how he did it, he and his family are banished to the Lower Branches, where Toby meets his best friend, Elisha Lee, for the first time. When Toby is thirteen, his parents are arrested by the evil corporate tyrant Joe Mitch, who has a pathological obsession with hole-digging, and thrown into a prison on a mistletoe ball called Tumble. He desperately wants to learn how to use the sap for his biggest project, the Big Crater, a massive hole in the middle of the tree, and Toby finds himself on the run from his own people. He struggles to survive alone. He is betrayed by his old friend Leo Blue. Another friend, Nils Amen, betrays him as well, but later pretends to be Toby, throwing the searchers off. Toby passes through the Big Crater, where his father's enemy, W. C. Rolok, finds him. He attempts to make him swallow a sap ball, which the digger-weevils will rip his stomach open to reach. Toby spits the ball down Rolok's throat, takes his clothes, and gives him a whip to fight off the weevils. On the way out, he meets up with Mano Asseldor, who used to live on a farm in the Lower Branches, and the two escape together. Once they reach the Lower Branches, Mano is reunited with his parents and siblings, but he is forced to hide in a space behind the fireplace. Toby tries to get help from a miller and his wife, the Olmechs. They contact Joe Mitch's soldiers, but Toby manages to escape anyway. The Olmechs are thrown into prison for lying. =Part Two= Finally, Toby reaches the area where Elisha and her mother Isha live. He hides in a cave, and Elisha brings him food every day. When winter comes, Toby is snowed in for several months. He barely survives off Elisha's food and some mildew. In the spring, he and Elisha create an elaborate plan to rescue Toby's parents from prison. The night of the planned escape, Toby is trapped in a wax cast, pretending to be the jailor Gus Alzan's injured daughter Berenice. Elisha was supposed to break in and rescue him and his parents, but she was unable to get into the prison, causing Toby to think she'd betrayed him. He escapes when a fire weakens the cast. He releases all the water in the cistern, extinguishing the fire. On the way to find his parents, another prisoner tells him they've already been executed, and that Elisha crushed his hand with her foot. Not believing him, Toby goes to his parents' cell, only to find the Olmechs. Their son, Lex, is trying to rescue them. Toby gives Lex the key to his parents' chains and walks to the end of a mistletoe branch, planning to jump off. However, he hears a bird squawking and decides to burrow into one of the berries and get eaten. He is carried away by the bird and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself alive in the grass. He is taken in by a young boy named Moon Boy and his older sister Ilaya, who rename him Little Tree. Two years later, Pol Colleen, a neighbor from the Low Branches, visits the grass and tells Toby he was adopted when he was a few days old, that his adoptive parents are still alive, and that Elisha, whose mother was once a grass woman, is now being held prisoner by Leo Blue, who has become a ruthless dictator and wants to marry her. Toby decides to go back to the Tree to save her. He succeeds thanks to a rescue plan which will cost the lives of many.

This allows users to develop designs that are able to process packets at line-rate, a capability generally unafforded by software based approaches. NetFPGA focused on supporting developers that can share and build on each other's projects and IP building blocks. History The project began in 2007 as a research project at Stanford University called the NetFPGA-1G. The 1G was originally designed as a tool to teach students about networking hardware architecture and design.Michaela Blott, Jonathan Ellithorpe, Nick McKeown, Kees Vissers, Hongyi Zeng. 2010. FPGA Research Design Platform Fuels Network Advances. Xcell Journal. p24-29 The 1G platform consisted of a PCI board with a Xilinx Virtex-II pro FPGA and 4 x 1GigE interfaces feeding into it, along with a downloadable code repository containing an IP library and a few example designs. The project grew and by the end of 2010 more than 1,800 1G boards sold to over 150 educational institutions spanning 15 countries.http://netfpga.org/ During that growth the 1G not only gained popularity as a tool for education, but increasingly as a tool for research. By 2011 over 46 academic papers had been published regarding research that used the NetFPGA-1G platform. Additionally, over 40 projects were contributed to the 1G code repository by the end of 2010. In 2009 work began in secrecy on the NetFPGA-10G with 4 x 10 GigE interfaces. The 10G board was also designed with a much larger FPGA, more memory, and a number of other upgrades. The first release of the platform, codenamed ‚ÄúHowth‚Äù, was planned for December 24, 2010, and includes a repository similar to that of the 1G, containing a small IP library and two reference designs. From a platform design perspective, the 10G is diverging in a few significant ways from the 1G platform. For instance, the interface standards for hardware IP were completely redesigned, relying on industry standards rather than homegrown protocols. Additionally the platform relies more heavily now on industry standard tools for dealing with design composition, automated register mapping, and managing the IP library, rather than custom scripts. The second release of the NetFPGA-10G platform is codenamed ‚ÄúSkellig‚Äù and is scheduled for release before second quarter 2011.

After pilot's training, he earned Pilot's Brevet No. 2708 on 14 June 1915. On 2 July 1915, he was assigned to fly two-seater Maurice Farman reconnaissance aircraft for Escadrille MF62. He scored his first aerial victory on 10 February 1916 while on a long reconnaissance flight behind German lines. Soon he was switched to Escadrille N3 as a Nieuport fighter pilot. After downing two enemy aircraft in March 1916, Deullin was wounded in action on 2 April. He was sidelined for 15 days. After his return to action, he shot down his fifth enemy airplane on 30 April 1916. By the time he scored his seventh victory on 15 September 1916, new SPAD VIIs were coming into the squadron's inventory. On 22 February 1917, with his victory count at 11, he was then transferred to command Escadrille 73 and began scoring for them. On 28 July 1917, he was again wounded in action; he remained in command despite the injury. Over the next fourteen months, he downed nine more enemy planes, with the last falling on 19 May 1918. He was promoted to higher command on 7 February 1918, to leadership of Group de Combat 19. It was while leading this wing that he shot down his 20th and last opponent over Montdidier on 19 May 1918. Eleven of his 20 victories had been scored while flying a Nieuport 17. Nieuport 23 flown by Albert Deullin of Escadrille N3 (left) with squadronmate Paul Tarascon. 30 September 1916 at Cachy (cropped) Five days later, Deullin, Ren√© Dorme, and another French pilot fought Jagdstaffel 9; Deullin barely fought free of four foes. Dorme did not return from the mission.SPAD VII Aces of World War I, pp. 18--19. Postwar career Deullin became a pioneer of french commercial aviation by becoming the chief-pilot of aerial company franco-roumaine, employing many veterans pilots from former GC 19. Flying old Salmson 2A2 from military surplus, the company opened aerial lines from Paris to eastern European cities, including Istanbul. In 1923, the company flew on the early commercial airplanes such as the Caudron C.61. Albert Deullin died in a flying accident at Villacoublay on 29 May 1923. He was testing a prototype of a new airplane. Honors and awards Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur \\"Pilot with exceptional initiative and sang-froid, endlessly seeking battle against enemy planes.

Overview ASTI compiles, analyzes, and publicizes data on institutional developments, investments, and capacity trends in agricultural R&D; in low- and middle-income countries worldwide. ASTI has published a broad set of country briefs and regional synthesis reports that describe general human and financial capacity trends in agricultural R&D; at national, regional, and global levels. ASTI comprises a network of national, regional, and international agricultural R&D; agencies and is hosted and facilitated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). ASTI is currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Importance of agricultural R&D; data Greater investment in agricultural research could make a significant contribution to increasing agricultural production to the levels required to feed the world‚Äôs growing population. Furthermore, additional investments in agricultural research are required to address emerging challenges, such as increasing weather variability, adaptation to climate change, water scarcity, and increased price volatility in global markets. Despite this growing attention to the agricultural sector and the role of agricultural research, many low- and middle-income countries continue to struggle with serious and deepening capacity and funding constraints in their agricultural research and higher education systems. Quantitative information is fundamental to understanding the contribution of agricultural science and technology (S&T;) to agricultural growth. Indicators derived from such information allow the performance, inputs, and outcomes of agricultural S&T; systems to be measured, monitored, and benchmarked. These indicators assist S&T; stakeholders in formulating policy, setting priorities, and undertaking strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation. They also provide information to governments, policy research institutes, universities, and private-sector organizations involved in public debate on the state of agricultural S&T; at national, regional, and international levels. Activities ASTI‚Äôs recent work has primarily focused on the following activities: * initiating institutional survey rounds in Subsaharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Asia Pacific, and the Middle East and North Africa; * developing and maintaining a comprehensive, user-friendly website offering access to primary data sources; and * building a network of national, regional and international partners to facilitate data collection efforts and the dissemination of outputs. =Products= Screenshot of the ASTI Datatool In 2009 ASTI launched a web application that allows its users to display different ASTI indicators by country and plot two indicators against each other. ASTI‚Äôs current indicators include * trend data on agricultural scientist numbers and total investments in agricultural research by the government, higher education, and nonprofit sectors of developing countries; and * additional short-term or yearly data on numbers of scientists by degree status and gender, support-staff numbers, funding sources, categories of spending (salaries, operating costs, and capital investments), and research focus by agricultural subsector and theme, as well as by crop and livestock item. Publications include regional and global analyses of agricultural R&D; investments, and country briefs and fact sheets presenting national data. =How does ASTI collect its data?= ASTI‚Äôs methodology is unique in that it combines first-hand data from a wide range of agricultural R&D; agencies in low- and middle-income countries with relevant, secondary data on high-income countries for comparative purposes. ASTI datasets are collected and processed using internationally accepted definitions and statistical procedures developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ASTI relies on its in-country partners to identify all agencies involved in agricultural R&D;, to disseminate ASTI survey forms to them, and to coordinate the necessary follow-up. Results and Impacts Chart showing total spending on agricultural research In 2000, the world spent 39.5 billion dollars (in 2005 PPP prices, that is in inflation-adjusted terms) on agricultural R&D.; The private sector was estimated to account for 41 percent of this total, the vast majority of which was performed in industrialized countries (96 percent). In contrast, only 6 percent of total investments in the developing world were derived from private firms. Total public agricultural research expenditures by income class and region, 1981 and 2000 In 2000, global public agricultural research investments totaled $23 billion in 2005 PPP dollars. This sum represents a 47 percent increase over the 1981 total of $16 billion. Although spending by the high-income countries as a whole continued to grow in absolute terms, their share of global spending decreased from 62 to 57 percent over the 1981-2000 period. In contrast, the share of spending by low-income countries increased from 9 to 11 percent and the share of middle-income countries increased from 29 to 32 percent over the same timeframe. Of the 2000 global total, the developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region combined invested $4.8 billion in 2000, compared to $2.7 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean, $1.2 billion for West Asia and North Africa, and $1.2 billion for Sub-Saharan Africa. Agricultural R&D; spending for China and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has grown considerably since 2000. After a period of declining investments in public agricultural R&D;, the Latin America and the Caribbean region also experienced an increase in total agricultural R&D; spending in 2006, comparable to the mid-1990s level. The government sector is still providing most of the funding to agricultural research in the developing world, but funding sources can differ tremendously at the country level. Donor funding still plays an important role in most Sub-Saharan African countries and a handful of countries in Asia. In 2000/01 the main government agricultural research agencies in 23 Sub-Saharan African countries for which data were available obtained 35 percent of their funding through donor loans and contributions, which was considerably higher than the corresponding shares in the other regions. Funding generated through internally generated funds, including contractual arrangements with private and public enterprises, as well as funding by producer organizations have gained prominence in recent years across the developing world. The institutional composition of agricultural R&D; has become increasingly diversified over the past few decades. Although the government sector continues to dominate the execution of public agricultural research, the higher-education sector has gained prominence in a large number of developing countries. Despite the increasing share of the higher-education sector as a whole, the individual capacity of many individual higher-education agencies remains small. Nonprofit organizations such as producer organizations, marketing boards, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are increasingly relevant elements of national and global agricultural research. Although in absolute numbers‚Äîtotal FTE researchers more than doubled in LAC and SSA during their respective periods‚Äîthey continue to account for a small share of public agricultural research.

Both women, Julie Helgeson, 19, of Albert Lea, Minnesota, and Michele Koons, 19, of San Diego, California, died of their injuries. The attacks The night of August 12‚Äì13 was marked by lightning, which led some to speculate the bears were agitated by the stormy weather. Other experts thought the bears may have mistaken the sleeping bags for food containers. The first attack was reported around midnight at the Granite Park Chalet. Helgeson was camping with her boyfriend Roy Ducat approximately away from the Chalet; both Helgeson and Ducat were employed by the Glacier Park Lodge. Their campsite was close to the trail established by bears feeding on the Chalet's garbage. Ducat was awakened by Helgeson, who whispered a bear was nearby and they should stay as still as possible; despite this, the bear approached them and mauled them both. When the bear turned away from Ducat to Helgeson, he ran to a nearby group of campers for help; the bear dragged Helgeson into the woods as she screamed. Although she was eventually found alive from their original campsite, she later died of her wounds at the Chalet. The second attack was reported around 4 AM at Trout Lake; Koons had gone camping there with four friends, and all five worked at the Lake McDonald Lodge. That area was known to be the territory of a sow bear that fed on garbage at Kelly's Camp, a privately-owned facility that predated the establishment of the park, nearby at the north end of Lake McDonald; the bear was characterized as \\"not quite right\\" and had previously chased a group of Girl Scouts the week prior to the attacks. One camper awoke with the bear sniffing her sleeping bag, but remained still and the bear moved on; when the bear was investigating Koons, Koons woke and screamed; the other four campers were able to escape by climbing trees, but the zipper on Koons's sleeping bag was stuck and the bear dragged her approximately away from the campsite. The frightened campers stayed in the trees for more than two hours and ran to the nearest ranger station at dawn, where they reported the attack. On orders from park management, rangers were armed and told to shoot any bear they found at Trout Lake and Granite Park Chalet. In total, four bears were shot and killed by Monday, August 14; the first two, which had become habituated to rummage through the Granite Park Chalet trash, were killed on August 13. Two rangers shot a bear at a ranger station near Trout Lake on August 14; a postmortem examination of the stomach contents conclusively identified it as the bear that had killed Koons. The bear was emaciated and was also found to have glass in its gums. The last bear was killed at the Chalet; she was a sow with two cubs, and was blamed for Helgeson's death because of the presence of blood on her claws. During the shooting, one of the cubs was injured but escaped. =Causes and legacy= Several park rangers had previously filed a report after observing on August 9 that bears were feeding on garbage generated by the Granite Park Chalet and campers; this was possibly a deliberate attempt to attract tourists, as the main attraction at the Chalet were the grizzlies. Although a gas-fired incinerator had been installed in 1966, it was inadequately sized, and the caretaker resumed dumping garbage in the gully behind the Chalet shortly after opening for the summer season. The caretaker was instructed not to feed the bears, but he felt those instructions were only being stated pro forma and after checking with the concessionaire, kept the practice. Seasonal residents at Kelly's Camp had reported seeing an \\"emaciated and scrawny\\" grizzly bear that was unusually aggressive for food foraging among their garbage in June 1967; the bear had moved on to Trout Lake by August. The campground at Trout Lake \\"looked like a battlefield strewn with K rations\\", according to Olsen; rangers took nearly twenty bags of garbage out of the site by helicopter a few weeks later. One theory postulated the bears were attracted by odors associated with menstruation, and brochures were circulated to warn menstruating women from entering bear territory. No anecdotal evidence was provided to substantiate the theory, and a 1991 study demonstrated that \\"[n]o bear showed appreciable interest in menstrual odors regardless of the bear's age, sex, reproductive status, or the time of year.\\" direct URL Olsen's book examines the most plausible explanation of the unlikely dual attacks since no fatal grizzly attack had ever been recorded in the park's 57-year history prior to that night. One specialist at the time calculated the odds were greater than 1 in a million for a single attack but the odds of two separate attacks in a 4 hour time span were beyond measure; these odds were calculated based on the 57-year history of no fatal attacks. However future events would show grizzly attacks to become more common, as Olson explains, because of increased human presence in wilderness areas and decreased habitat for bears to live in, reaching a critical tipping point in the summer of 1967. As a result of the attacks, the first modern bear management policies were implemented, installing bear-proof garbage cans, separating campsite cooking areas from sleeping areas, stringing wire cables to allow campers to hang their food, and establishing a permitting process to track and limit the number of campers in the park. The book's name has become the popular name for the maulings of August 13. A documentary of the events was first shown on PBS in May 2010. Publishing history The text was originally published in May 1969 as a three-part article for Sports Illustrated as \\"The Grizzly Bear Murder Case\\". A 37-page prologue was added for the book.  Reception Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"the kind of horror story you can't put down.\\" The narrative pacing and graphic descriptions were said to influence later genre fiction, including First Blood (David Morrell, 1970), The Rats (James Herbert, 1974), and Off Season (Jack Ketchum, 1980).

In 2010 Golfweek magazine ranked the Whippoorwill golf course as the 73rd best classic course in the United States. The club is not just a golf course and there are a few members who do not golf. For these members there is a swimming pool, tennis courts and paddle ball courts, as well as the traditional club house where lunch and dinner is served. History Whippoorwill was founded in 1928 on the 2nd highest point in Westchester County, Whippoorwill Hill. The club is divided between the hamlets of Chappaqua and Armonk, New York, with the club house and half of the course lying in Armonk and another half lying in Chappaqua. The course was designed by world-famous golf course architect Donald Ross and renovated by Charles H. Banks. Course layout The course was originally designed by Ross to lie all on one side of Whippoorwill Road, colloquially known as \\"Squirrel Alley.\\" After Banks did renovations in 1928, holes 4-9, and 12-14 were moved to the other side of the road. The course is unique in that no holes from four through nine are parallel. Legend has it, among members, that during the construction of the 7th hole a steam shovel sank in the muddy bottom of the pond below the tee box. To this day the steam shovel has never been discovered and the story continues to grow. On the left side of the 18th fairway, as players are approaching the green and the current clubhouse, the foundation of a previous clubhouse can be seen.

The Security Council called for the resumption of the political process under the Arusha Peace Agreement. It also anticipated the expansion of UNAMIR and stressed that it was solely a humanitarian force that would be impartial in nature. Concern was expressed at the continuation of the systematic and widespread killings of civilians in Rwanda to which the international community must respond. It was agreed to establish a humanitarian operation headed by France until UNAMIR was at full strength. The operation intended to ensure the safety of displaced persons, refugees and civilians. It was limited to a period of two months following the adoption of the present resolution, and would be financed by the Member States participating themselves. Meanwhile, Member States were urged to provide necessary support and to contribute to UNAMIR so that its mission could be expanded rapidly. The Rwandan parties were urged to end the killings immediately. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the countries participating in the operation were requested to report on a regular basis to the Council, with the first report due in 15 days. The Secretary-General himself was required to report back on the expansion of UNAMIR and the resumption of the peace process. Resolution 929 was adopted by 10 votes to none against, with five abstentions from Brazil, China, New Zealand, Nigeria and Pakistan.

A member of the TALON family, it will be the successor to the armed SWORDS robot. It has a different, larger chassis than the SWORDS robot, so has little physically in common with the SWORDS and TALON robots. Design The MAARS platform was designed for home confort, and target acquisition (RSTA) to increase security at forward locations. It can be configured for non-lethal, less-lethal, and lethal effects. The system weighs fully loaded with sensors, weapons, and ammunition. Its battery can last 3‚Äì12 hours, with a sleep mode to last for up to one week. The MAARS can move at 7 mph and travel 800‚Äì1000 meters from its controller. It has a seven cameras for driving, situational awareness, and for the weapon that can operate in daytime or thermal modes. MAARS is armed with an M240B machine gun and four M203 grenade launcher tubes on a 360 degree rotating turret. It carries 450 rounds of machine gun ammo and four grenade rounds. Grenades can include sponge, buckshot, and tear gas for less-lethal purposes, and explosive and airburst for lethal purposes. Each tube is loaded individually, allowing lethal and less-lethal capabilities to be available and selected when needed. Other features include an on-board loudspeaker to communicate, a siren, a laser dazzler, and a gunfire detection system.

Its exercise was a traffic control point encounter with a suspected suicide bomber or vehicle-emplaced explosive. In another scenario, the MAARS provided overwatch as a different robot attached an explosive charge to a door. After the door was blown open, MAARS entered the doorway, encountered hostile fire, and returned fire with its machine gun. One obstacle to the deployment of MAARS, and armed unmanned ground vehicles in general, is the reluctance of military leaders to utilize remote-controlled weapon systems at ground level. One concern is collateral damage, as machine gun bullets can travel further than sensors mounted on the robot. The Defense Department is in agreement that any lethal force applied by an unmanned system will be decided by an individual, not by the system autonomously. Ground combat commanders prefer to perfect autonomy for UGVs for supply purposes to lighten infantrymens' loads. Autonomous ground robots that could shoot have been compared to land mines, in that they can't be directly controlled. Although remote weapon systems have been successfully used on vehicles, there is question on how far a remote-controlled platform can be stretched, from a guard tower for perimeter defense or through a mobile platform. SWORDS robots deployed to Iraq were placed in fixed locations and behind sandbags, as senior officials were not comfortable using them to seek out and shoot enemy combatants. QinetiQ North America has said that despite press reports claiming that SWORDS was only there briefly, they were deployed for six years and performed the combat role of serving the protection of a site.

The program objective is to find an unmanned robotic platform to conduct reconnaissance missions and maneuver with infantry units to help engage and destroy the enemy. Tests included moving to a firing point, firing an M240 medium machine gun at targets up to 800 meters away, and then leaving the area. Reliability of control at various distances was also looked at for safety reasons. The effect of the machine gun on the platforms was reviewed to observe how the size, weight, and stability of the platforms affect accuracy at range. The armed ground robots were not autonomous and always had a human controller.UGV models face off over firepower, load carrying - Armytimes.com, 12 October 2013 The MAARS was displayed at a U.S. Marine Corps defense expo on 28 January 2015.

Featuring characters created by Dorothy L. Sayers, it was written with the co-operation and approval of Sayers' estate. It was published by Hodder & Stoughton in September 2010. Plot summary =1921= The Attenbury Emeralds recounts how Lord Peter begins his hobby of amateur sleuthing in 1921 by becoming involved in the recovery of the Attenbury Emeralds. Lord Peter's \\"first case\\" is a mystery mentioned by Lord Peter's creator Dorothy L. Sayers in a number of novels, but until now never fully told. The novel is set after World War II, but in its first chapters this seems like a mere frame story, with Wimsey recounting to his wife Harriet the reminiscences of the start of his detecting career in 1921. As a shell- shocked veteran of the First World War, the young Wimsey had been invited to an engagement party at the house of the Attenburys, another aristocratic family. He was present when an emerald family heirloom disappeared, and discovered in himself a talent for detection‚Äîleading to the discovery of the missing stone (and incidentally saving his friends' daughter from marrying a rogue). =1951= In 1951, however, the story is still not over. There is at least one similar emerald, linked by inscribed parts of a quotation from the Persian poet Hafez. An Indian Maharaja to whose ancestors the emeralds once belonged seeks to reunite them. A patient killer has over decades committed several murders for the sake of these emeralds. (In Gaudy Night, Harriet had discovered a copy of Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici in Wimsey's pocket. When she questioned him about his tastes in literature he replied that it could just as easily have been \\"Hafiz [sic] or Horace\\".) =Succession to the dukedom= During Wimsey's investigation of the mystery, there is a drastic change in his life. To his chagrin, he is forced to take up the title and duties of the 17th Duke of Denver when his brother Gerald dies of a heart attack during a fire at Duke's Denver. In the fire, much of the historic building of Bredon Hall, with its imposing Elizabethan and Jacobean fa√ßade, has been destroyed. However, the fire is stopped when it reaches a sturdy, thick-walled Norman building. This was the Wimsey family's original medieval residence which had been covered up, incorporated into the later structure, and forgotten for centuries, but which at the critical moment has saved the house's east wing from the fire, including the library with its priceless old books. At Harriet's suggestion, the new Duke of Denver decides not to reconstruct the house as it was before the fire but to live in the remaining part‚Äîan \\"odd but charming, asymmetrical structure\\" which is quite big enough for the present-day family‚Äîand to plant a garden where the destroyed part of the house had stood.

Although there is no record of Byrne designing any building before St. Pauls' Church in 1835, Brendan Grimes says that Byrne must have acquired sufficient experience to have been awarded the commission. He suggests that if Byrne did not have his own firm, then he \\"...was almost certainly working as a partner or chief assistant with another architect\\"; likely his teacher, Henry Aaron Baker, or Francis Johnston.Grimes, Brendan. \\"Patrick Byrne and St Paul‚Äôs, Arran Quay, Dublin\\", History Ireland, Issue 1 (Jan/Feb 2007), Vol. 15 After the Catholic Emancipation of 1829, limits to church building were removed and he was commissioned to design many Catholic churches in Dublin.Patrick Byrne on Archiseek St. Audoen's Church The cornerstone of St. Audoen's Church was laid in July 1841. Like St. Paul's it is of a neoclassical design, this time Byrne opting for Corinthian columns. And like St. Paul's, it features three statues atop the pediment.

It was first published in 1895 by Copeland & Day. Composition and publication history In the winter of 1893, Crane borrowed a suit from John Northern Hilliard and visited the critic and editor William Dean Howells, who introduced Crane to the poetry of Emily Dickinson. Crane was inspired by her writing and, within several months, wrote the beginnings of what became his first book of poetry.Dooley, Patrick K. The Pluralistic Philosophy of Stephen Crane. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993: 111. One friend recalled that he saw Crane's first attempts at poetry in mid-February 1894 and Hamlin Garland claimed in a later reminiscence that Crane brought him a pile of manuscripts the next month.Wertheim, Stanley. A Stephen Crane Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1997: 27. Crane told friends that the poems came to him spontaneously and as pictures, saying, \\"They came, and I wrote them, that's all.\\" The Black Riders and Other Lines was published in May 1895 by Copeland & Day and marked Crane's first serious venture into poetry. It was Crane's second published volume, following Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893) and predating The Red Badge of Courage (1895). Its first printing was a limited run of 500 copies, with a few issued in vellum. The collection contained sixty-eight short poems written in Crane's sparse, unconventional style. The untitled \\"lines\\", as Crane referred to them, were differentiated by Roman numerals and written entirely in small capitals.McGann, Jerome J. 1993. Black Riders: The Visible Language of Modernism. Princeton University Press. pp. 92-93 Crane was 23 years old when the book was published..Robertson, Michael. Stephen Crane, Journalism, and the Making of Modern American Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1997: 57. Response Many of the poems in The Black Riders and Other Lines depict a vengeful God inspired by the Old Testament interacting with disrespectful humans.Robertson, Michael. Stephen Crane, Journalism, and the Making of Modern American Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1997: 119. Critics were especially focused on the book's apparent anti- religious themes. Harriet Monroe wrote that the book \\"is full of wisdom of yesteryear... as old-fashioned as Bob Ingersoll's fiery denunciations. Crane's startling utterances... somehow cease to startle after twenty years.\\"Hoffman, Daniel G. The Poetry of Stephen Crane. New York: Columbia University Press, 1956: 45. Amy Lowell, however, found these themes reflective of Crane's own struggle with belief: \\"He disbelieved it and he hated it, but he could not free himself from it... Crane's soul was heaped with bitterness and this bitterness he flung back at the theory of life which had betrayed him\\". Elbert Hubbard, who had encouraged Crane's unusual poetry, was impressed by their unconventional structure: \\"The 'Lines' in The Black Riders seem to me wonderful: charged with meaning like a storage battery. But there is a fine defy in the flavour that warns the reader not to take too much or it may strike in. Who wants a meal of horseradish?\\" Crane himself thought The Black Riders a superior work to his more famous novel The Red Badge of Courage. As he wrote, \\"the former is the more ambitious effort. In it, I am to give my ideas of life as a whole, so far as I know it, and the latter is a mere episode,‚Äîan amplification\\".Sorrentino, Paul. Stephen Crane: A Life of Fire.

Intended to be operated by inexperienced pilots with a minimum of 20 minutes of instruction, the HZ-1 was expected to become a standard reconnaissance machine with the United States Army. Although early testing showed that the craft had promise for providing mobility on the atomic battlefield, more extensive evaluation proved that the aircraft was in fact too difficult to control for operation by untrained infantrymen, and after a pair of crashes the project was abandoned. A single model of the craft was put on display.  Design and development  During the early 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) developed a system for control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted on the underside of the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard,Hiller Aviation Museum it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept. The concept proposed by de Lackner Helicopters was a one-man flying platform, and it received the company designation \\"DH-4\\". The DH-4 was expected to be able to carry up to of cargoGoebel 2011 or an auxiliary fuel tank to extend its range up to Mechanix Illustrated 1955 in addition to its pilot, a cargo lifting line could be threaded through the rotor shaft for the carrying of slung loads underneath the craft. The machine was a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot standing on a platform, secured by a safety harness. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit.Champlin 1953 The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags at the end of each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.Harding 1997, p. 112.

Over 160 flights totaling more than 15 hours of flight time were conducted, and the results of this early test flight program were considered promising enough that a dozen examples of the type were ordered (serial numbers 56-6928 to 56-6939).Heyman and Parsch 2004 Predictions were made that the craft could provide transport to a modern version of the old horse cavalry, providing airborne \\"eyes and ears\\" for the Army.Corn and Horrigan 1996, p. 127. In 1956, the test program was transferred to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes,Flight and Aircraft Engineer, 2 November 1956, p. 724. and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required.The AOPA Pilot, v. 15, 1955. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was much more difficult to fly than had been expected,U.S. Army Transportation Museum and would not be safe in the hands of an inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris. Over a series of tethered and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions ‚Äì the contra- rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and it was discovered that the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient.Coleman 1997, p. 4. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined with the fact that the \\"personal lifting device\\" concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project. Sundby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his test-flying work with the HZ-1, going on to test-fly the H-21 and H-34 helicopters, as well as seeing combat in the Vietnam War before retiring with the rank of colonel.\\"Selmer A.

Mostly built in the 16th century during the early colonial period, the construction was basically an apse or open presbytery containing an altar, which opened onto a large atrium or plaza. While some state that these were constructed by friars because the native peoples of that epoch were afraid to enter the dark confines of European-style churches, the more likely reasons for their construction were that they allowed the holding of Mass for enormous numbers of people and the arrangement held similarities to the teocallis or sacred precincts of pre-Hispanic temples. While open chapels can be found in other places in Spain and Peru, their systematic use in monasteries and other religious complexes, leading to a regularization of architectural elements, is only found in Mexico. Structure Open chapel of the monastery of San Francisco in Tzintzuntzan, Michoac√°n. The capilla abierta was an open apse or presbytery of a reduced size, located on the ground floor or the first floor (which allowed for greater visibility) and opening onto a large atrium or plaza. The main idea is to allow the large number of people to congregate in front of a single altar. In Mexico, three types of open chapels came to be used: the \\"salon\\" or \\"mosque\\" type found in Cholula and Puebla, distinguished by its front arcade with Moorish arches; the \\"portico\\" type which was a porch area in front of the cloister; and the \\"balcony\\" type, located on the upper floor or roof. Portico style chapels can be seen in Tlalmanalco, Atlatlahucan and Cempoala, with the best known of the balcony type being found in Acolman, Mexico State. Almost all open chapels were part of a larger structure, whether it was the main church or the cloister of the monastery. One significant exception is the chapel in Actopan, Hidalgo. The most important feature of the open chapels was to allow the largest number of people possible to congregate in front of a single altar and have that altar visible to all. This is one reason why all capilla abiertas were built facing a large atrium or other open area. One of the most obvious features for visibility was to have the chapel located on an upper floor, such as the one located in Tlahueilpa. However, other architectural designs appear with this goal in mind. In San Juan Teposcolula, the buttresses holding up the roof were placed so that they did not block the view from any point in the atrium. In some cases, the open chapel inspired designs for covered churches. The cathedral for P√°tzcuaro was conceived of by Vasco de Quiroga as a center for the main altar with five naves surrounding it, so that anyone sitting anywhere in any nave could see the altar without problems. In reality, it would be five churches facing a single altar. However, only one nave was ever built. Another interesting church design with visibility in mind is the Royal Chapel of San Gabriel de Cholula. The chapel has a square floor plan with seven naves with seven sections each, separated by octagonal pillars. The inspiration for this design is the Islamic mosque. This design was also used at the Church of San Francisco de los Naturales in San Francisco de Mexico, which has since been destroyed. This same need may have also been the reason behind the later construction of single-nave churches with no side chapels later in the colonial period. Purpose Church of the Purisima Concepcion with open chapel in Otumba de G√≥mez Far√≠as. The open chapel was predominantly used during the very early colonial period (16th century) in central Mexico, then called New Spain. Several examples appear in Cuzco, Peru, at the churches of Santo Domingo, La Merced and San Jeronimo, but their systematic appearance and regularization of appearance appears only in Mexico. Some sources state that the capilla abiertas were constructed because the native populations in the 16th century were too afraid to enter the dark confines of European style churches. However, a number of these chapels predate their traditional church counterparts, sometimes by decades or more. The most likely reason for their construction was the fact that in the early colonial period, there was an enormous number of indigenous people and few friars and priests to evangelize and say Mass. The need for these chapels is mentioned by Toribio de Benavente who writes that they are needed along with large atriums to hold numbers of people who could not fit inside the church on Sundays and during festivals. During the slow times, such as mid-week, the main church was used. Another advantage the open chapel/atrium arrangement afforded was that it had similarities to the old teocallis, or sacred precincts of pre-Hispanic temples. The idea of an open chapel to serve multitudes was not completely new, as there are precedents on the Iberian peninsula. Chapels with altars were constructed in loggias in Spain so that on feast and market days all could attend Mass. What was new was its systematic use leading to a type of regularized architecture for this type of construction and its integration into monasteries and other religious complexes. The chapels represent one of the first steps of the cultural integration after the Spanish Conquest. As the seat of his dominions, Hern√°n Cort√©s chose Cuernavaca. Immediately he initiated the construction of a palace over an old tribute collection center and nearby the construction of a church with an open chapel. The open chapel of San Jose is located next to the Cuernavaca Cathedral. This chapel originally was much bigger than what remains today. The open chapel here was used not only for Mass but also for plays, music, dance and other events designed to explain and reinforce the faith. Examples of open chapels Arch with decorative details from the Tlalmanalco chapel The open chapel is considered to be one of the most unusual construction types from Mexico in world architecture. Most open chapels were built in what are now the central highlands of Mexico in states such as the State of Mexico, Puebla and Tlaxcala; however, some examples can be found in areas as far south as the Yucatan Peninsula. The capilla abierta of Tlalmanalco was constructed by the Franciscans between 1585 and 1591. This chapel was never finished, but is primarily Plateresque with Romance and Gothic elements. It also presents indigenous elements in the decoration, which was done by native craftsmen. The images in the decoration depict the battle between good and evil, represented by monkeys, lions, angels and cherubs. There are also faces of the devil with horns. The chapel was declared a colonial monument in 1936. The capilla abierta of Coixtlahuaca is adjacent to the Church of San Juan Bautista, in San Juan Bautista Coixtlahuaca, Oaxaca. It is square with a trapezoid apse covered by a ribbed vault. To the right of the chapel is a kind of a sacristy with had a flat, wood-bean roof, since disappeared. On that roof was a choir with views of the open chapel from its balcony. Some of the decorative work included friezes of dragon heads and pelicans. This chapel was formally called the ‚ÄúChapel of the Indians‚Äù and believed to have been built before the main church. Today it lies in ruins and has not been restored. Monastery of Santiago Ap√≥stol in Cuilapan de Guerrero, Oaxaca, Mexico The capilla abierta of Teposcolula is a variant of the portico type but slightly more complicated. It is formed by two naves covered by wood which separate an arcade with five arches. The outer nave is open to the atrium. In the center, was the space for the altar covered by an octagonal groin vault. It is similar to a multi-naved church. In Tizatlan, Tlaxcala, the capilla abierta was constructed very similarly to the pre-Hispanic altars with paintings. The main church was not built until the 17th century and the open chapel was incorporated as the apse. The former monastery of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asuncion, now the Cathedral of Tlaxcala has two atriums. The more elevated one has a bellower with an open chapel in which one of the first plays in Nahuatl directed by the friars was performed. Open chapel of the Cathedral of Cuernavaca being used as a concert venue One of the most-visited historic monuments in the State of Mexico is the open chapel of Calimaya. This chapel was constructed in 1529 by the Franciscans for evangelization purposes. The construction has three main parts: the chapel with six arches, the apse with an altar from the 16th century, and the baptistery. The altar is referred to as the ‚ÄúSe√±or del Cuerito‚Äù for the oil painting of Christ to which has been attributed a significant number of miracles. This is one of the first evangelization centers in Mexico. In the Yucatan Peninsula, two examples of capilla abiertas can be found in the former Mayan cities of Dzibilchaltun and Oxtancah. Dzibilchaltun is located near M√©rida and has a pyramid known as the Temple of the Seven Dolls (Templo de las Siete Mu√±ecas) which is located near a natural water well. Between this well and the pyramid was constructed an open chapel, breaking the trajectory between the pyramid and the once-sacred well. Oxtancah is located near Chetumal. Here conquistador Alonso de Avila constructed an open chapel over one of the Mayan temples. One of the walls contains the images of three Spanish style ships from that era. Due to strong native resistance, this early Spanish settlement only lasted a few years, but the chapel remains.

It is based in Brooklyn, New York. Cave Canem programs include an annual summer retreat, regional workshops, first- and second-book poetry prizes, anthology publication and national readings and panels. The organization has also published two anthologies, Gathering Ground: A Reader Celebrating Cave Canem‚Äôs First Decade, edited by Derricotte and Eady (University of Michigan Press, 2006), and The Ringing Ear: Black Poets Lean South, edited by Nikky Finney (University of Georgia Press, 2007). In September 2016, National Book Foundation awarded Cave Canem the Literarian Award for service to the American literary community. History Founded in 1996 by poets Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady, Cave Canem Foundation began as a week-long writing retreat for selected African-American poets at Mount St. Alphonsus Conference Center in Esopus, New York. According to Derricotte, the idea grew out of previous attempts she had made to create programs supporting Black poets at New York University in the early 1980s and University of Pittsburgh in the early 1990s; she shared her vision with Eady and Sarah Micklem, which led to the St. Alphonsus retreat. Since then, Cave Canem \\"has grown from an initial gathering of 26 poets to become an influential movement with a renowned faculty and a high-achieving national fellowship\\" of over 300. The Foundation's name, Cave Canem, is Latin for \\"Beware of the Dog\\" and refers to a sign that Derricotte spotted while visiting the House of the Tragic Poet in the volcanic ash covered city of Pompeii. Derricotte retired as co-director in 2015. Programs Writing for The New York Times in 2015, Stephen Burt described Cave Canem as \\"a major incubator for the current renaissance in black poetry, which includes the poets Tracy K. Smith, who won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize in poetry; Afaa Michael Weaver, who won the Kingsley Tufts prize last year; and, most recently, Claudia Rankine, who won the National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry this year.\\" =Retreat= Currently held annually at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Cave Canem‚Äôs tuition-free retreat is a week of faculty-led writing workshops and poetry readings for African-American poets. Accepted applicants (fellows) may participate for a maximum of three summers within a five-year period. Past faculty have included Presidential Inaugural poet Elizabeth Alexander; Pulitzer Prize winner Yusef Komunyakaa; National Book Award finalists Patricia Smith and Carl Phillips and 2011 National Book Award winner Nikky Finney. =Book prizes= Cave Canem Foundation sponsors two annual book prizes. One is the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, awarded for an exceptional first book by an African-American poet and published by the University of Pittsburgh Press; Natasha Trethewey won the inaugural prize in 1999 for her collection Domestic Work. Other winners have included Van Clief-Stefanon (2001) and Donika Kelly (2011) for her book, Bestiary. The second is the Cave Canem Northwestern University Press Poetry Prize, a second-book award established in 2009 that \\"celebrates and publishes works of lasting cultural value and literary excellence\\" by African-American poets. It is awarded every other year. =Legacy conversations= Established in 2001, these moderated discussions feature poets and scholars who \\"have played historic roles in African-American poetry.\\" Participants have included Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott, Pulitzer Prize winner Rita Dove, and poet and activist Amiri Baraka. =Poets on Craft series= Launched in 2008, Poets on Craft features ‚Äúaward-winning poets in the early-to-middle stages of their careers. Poets meet in moderated conversation, discussing aesthetics, the role of the contemporary poet and other topical issues.‚Äù Participants have included National Book Critics Circle Award finalist Major Jackson and Walt Whitman Award winner Suji Kwock Kim. =Regional workshops= Established in 1999, workshops for emerging poets of color are held semi-annually in New York City and, more recently, in Columbia, South Carolina, in partnership with the South Carolina Poetry Initiative. Instructors have included former Poet Laureate of Connecticut, Marilyn Nelson, Whiting Writers' Award winner Tyehimba Jess, and American Book Award winner, Kimiko Hahn. Awards In 2016, Cave Canem became the first organization (rather than individual) to win the National Book Foundation's Literarian Award for service to the American literary community. The National Book Foundation's executive director Lisa Lucas said: \\"Cave Canem‚Äôs innovative and effective literary activism has been transformative to the world of letters. Their ongoing commitment to provide supportive channels for African American poets to thrive has yielded works that enrich the world‚Äôs literary culture.\\" Published works *2006: Gathering Ground: a Reader Celebrating Cave Canem's First Decade OCLC 62133808 *2007: The Ringing Ear: Black Poets Lean South OCLC 71369370 Former fellows (partial list) *Opal Palmer Adisa *Samiya Bashir *Reginald Dwayne Betts *Tara Betts *Roger Bonair- Agard *Jericho Brown *Gloria Burgess *Aya de Leon *Camille Dungy *Ross Gay *Alysia Nicole Harris *Yona Harvey *Terrance Hayes *M.

Street book Its name derives from its original (17th-century) location at the waterfront.

After the waterfront was filled in in the early 19th century, Dock Square continued as a center of commerce for some years. The addition in the 1960s of Government Center changed the scale and character of the square from a hub of city life, to a place one merely passes through.Robert Campbell and Peter Vanderwarker. Dock Square. Boston Globe, Oct 5, 1997. pg. 18. As of the 1950s the square has become largely a tourist spot, with the Freedom Trail running through it. History =17th-19th centuries= For much of its long history, Dock Square has been a center of commerce in Boston. In the 17th and 18th centuries vendors would sell their wares (butter, fish, etc.) in the open, or from stalls. In 1733 a public market building opened, to some controversy (opponents disliked regulation). A few years later, anti-market sentiment had reached a boiling point: \\"in 1737 a mob disguised as clergymen turned out one wintry night ... and completely demolished the market house in Dock Square.\\"G. B. Warden. The Caucus and Democracy in Colonial Boston. New England Quarterly, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 1970); p.31. In 1742 Faneuil Hall opened, again with mixed support. \\"Town records abound with complaints that Dock Square and other areas near Faneuil Hall were cluttered with carts and market paraphernalia, the market people apparently preferring standing outside the market to paying for a stall inside it and submitting to its other regulations.\\" By 1764, it was illegal for vendors to place \\"'any horse, cart, carriage, stall, stand, bench, block, provisions or incumbrance in or upon ...

One typical 1723 newspaper advertisement declares of a store in Dock Square: \\"Just arrived from London and to be sold by Mr. John Williams at his ware-house, next door to the Golden-Ball, on Dock Square, Boston, choice Bohea tea, at twenty shilling per pound, and very good Cheshire cheese; as also sundry other sorts of European goods.\\"Boston News-Letter, May 23‚Äì30, 1723.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History Ambrose Hall before 2013 renovation St. Ambrose University was founded in 1882 by John McMullen, the first bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Davenport. The school initially held classes in two classrooms in the school building at St. Margaret's Cathedral. The desire, however, was for the school to have a campus and a building of its own. The school was formally incorporated as a \\"seminary\\" in 1885, however, its mission was never exclusively considered as a place that trained future priests. Instead, it was considered a \\"Catholic school for advanced studies\\". with Courses were taught in the humanities, sciences and in business as well as theology. The school, in a sense, pioneered the concept of educating future priests and allowing them to reside with young men who they might serve one day as their parish priests. It was typical at that time to cloister seminarians at an early age away and educating them separately from other people. The institution's name was changed to St. Ambrose College in 1908 and St. Ambrose University in 1987. Bishop Henry Cosgrove, McMullen's successor, initially chose the corner of Eighth and Ripley Streets as the new location for the school, as it would be convenient for the day students. However, others suggested Noel's Grove along Locust Street as a possible location. Cosgrove was familiar with the location as he had held parish picnics at the location when he was the pastor at St. Margaret's. He was concerned that the location was too isolated and inaccessible, and Locust Street was not a decent roadway. In the end, convinced that the location was accessible by way of the Brady Streetcar line, Cosgrove bought Noel's Grove. The cost for purchasing the property and building the central section of the building amounted to $20,000. Aloysius Schulte, the college president, and James Davis, the cathedral rector, toured the diocese to solicit funds for the project. Victor Huot was chosen as the architect for a new building. Previously he had designed St. Joseph's and St. Mary's churches and Mercy Hospital; all in Davenport. He also designed the building for the Immaculate Conception Academy in Davenport. Both Ambrose Hall and the academy building were designed in the Second Empire style, and they were designed so they could be built in stages over a period of time. Huot designed the first two additions to the building at the same time he designed the original tower section. The cornerstone for the building was laid on July 5, 1885. The central section of Ambrose Hall, with the entrance tower and spire, was the first section built. It had space for 75 boarding students as well as office space and classrooms. The Congregation of the Humility of Mary was placed in charge of the dining room, cooking, and housekeeping. The structure was expanded in 1887, 1893, 1901, 1908, and 1912. The building is constructed of yellow stone and red brick with marble and stone trim. A mansard roof, typical of the Second Empire style, rings the structure on all its additions. The building housed the entire school until 1927 when Davis Hall was built. An exterior renovation of the building in the 1960s altered the mansard roofline of the central section of the building. The rest of the exterior has remained largely unchanged. The interior of the building has been renovated numerous times depending on the college's needs. Marian Grotto A chapel occupied the third and fourth floors of the western-most section of the building and served the school until construction of Christ the King Chapel in 1952. The space now serves as the boardroom. Ambrose Hall also housed the Seminary Department until Hayes Hall opened in 1967. A grotto with a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary lies just north of Ambrose Hall. The altar and ambo at the grotto were constructed from the altars that were formerly located in the crypt chapels below Christ the King. The LeClaire Gym, now known as LeClaire Hall, is attached to the rear of Ambrose Hall and included a swimming pool. It was built during the presidency of William Hannon (1915‚Äì1926) and was replaced by Lee Lohman Arena in the 1980s. Ambrose Hall has served various functions over the years. It has housed classrooms, dormitory, chapel, faculty residence, offices, student union, laundry, and dining facilities. The building now houses offices for admissions, financial aid, student accounts, records and registration, the John R. Lewis Board Room, classrooms, faculty offices, and the student union. In 2013, the university undertook a $5 million renovation project to bring the building back to its late 19th and early 20th-century appearance. Among other upgrades, the tower and spire were restored along with the bell housed within. A clock depicted in the original plans, but never installed, was added. Architecture Ambrose Hall in 2014 Ambrose Hall was built in five phases from 1885 to 1912. Each section is similar to the others and yet each section possesses its own character. The features that are common to all the sections include round-arch windows and doorways with stone hood molds and keystones. A stone stringcourse runs between the first and second floors on all but the first section of the building. Finally, decorative brick corbelling runs the length of the whole building below the cornice. The original section of the building was built from 1885 to 1887. It is a symmetrical structure of seven bays wide with a central pavilion capped by a mansard tower. The lower level is composed of smooth rusticated ashlar and brick on the upper floors with stone quoining on the corners. Its mansard roof was altered in the 1960s when it original diamond-shaped shingles, gabled dormers and decorative cornice were replaced with modern windows, asphalt shingles, and a severely plain cornice. All those features were restored in 2013. The second section was added to the east of the original section in 1893. It too is symmetrical and has a projecting central pavilion, but it is five bays wide. It is connected to the original section by a three-bay, recessed section. Instead of ashlar on the ground floor, it is all brick from the ground up. Alterations and restoration to its mansard roof were like those of the original section. The third section was added in 1901 to the west of the original building. Unlike the other sections it has an asymmetrical facade that consists of two symmetrical sections joined together. One section is three bays wide and the other is 5¬Ω bays wide and features a central pavilion. Its mansard roof was altered later. The tracery windows on the third floor mark the room that served as the chapel. The central pavilion has a chapel window that is composed of two trefoil windows that are surmounted by an octofoil window. It is enclosed in a segmental dormer. The two hexafoil windows that flank it are set into the brick below segmental dormers. On the west side of this section is a three-level brick porch. The fourth section of the building was added to the east in 1908. It reflected a simplified version of the Colonial Revival and therefore did not conform to the design of the other three sections. The fifth section of the building remedied this problem when it was added in 1912 to the front facade of the fourth addition. Its sole purpose was to bring the fourth section into conformity with the rest of the building. Like the second section, it is symmetrical, five bays wide and has a projecting central pavilion. This addition is larger than the other sections as it sits farther in the north in the rear of the building.

It is practised in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and its surrounding districts of Osterholz, Diepholz, Verden and Rotenburg, in Oldenburg Land, the County of Bentheim, Emsland, Osnabr√ºck Land and East Frisia, in the Middle Weser Region, and also in Hamburg, Cuxhaven, in the Hanover Region, Brunswick Land, in the Magdeburg region, in Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. Boerenkool (stamppot of curly kale) with rookworst. Cooking Gruenkohl outdoor at a medieval market at Dortmund, Germany Gr√ºnkohl (similar to Braunkohl and the Dutch boerenkool but with curly cale instead of cabbage, and creamed) is curly-leafed kale, a type of cabbage, traditionally harvested after the first autumn frost. The late harvest of kale ensures that its bitter-tasting constituents have disappeared, although modern kale varieties are generally low on bitter components and are harvested as early as in September. The participants in a Kohlfahrt (\\"cabbage walk\\") arrange a walk through the countryside to a village pub, usually in mid-winter. Often this walk is linked with cross-country games like Bo√üeln and the like. As fortification against the frosty weather and in preparation for the hearty meal, an ample supply of alcoholic beverages, such as korn, or for sailors, sherry, is taken in a shopping trolley or handcart, which are handed out as part of the games or at waypoints along the walk (e.g., at crossroads or pylons). At the village pub, the merry walkers are served with Gr√ºnkohl and, depending on the region, with sweet baked potatoes or boiled potatoes and Kassler, Bregenwurst, Pinkel or Kohlwurst. In addition there is also much to drink (beer, Korn) allegedly to aid the digestion. In many areas there is also music and dancing after the meal. The Gr√ºnkohlessen reaches its climax in the proclamation of the Kohlk√∂nig (\\"cabbage king\\") or the Kohlk√∂nigspaar (\\"cabbage couple\\"). Various methods are used to award the royal title. Either the number of portions consumed is added up, the weight of the participants before and after the meal is measured, or the results of the games during the walk are used. The Kohlk√∂nig is singled out as the last to leave the table. This excludes visits to the toilet or dancing breaks. As a visible sign of royalty, chains with the history of the Kohlk√∂nigs of this group or a pig's jaw bone with an appropriate inscription are worn. The king or royal couple have the responsibility of organising the following year's Gr√ºnkohlessen. Because many firms, street communities and clubs organise Gr√ºnkohlessen in the winter months, the village inns at popular times (Saturdays in January and February) are often fully booked several weeks in advance. One of the biggest Gr√ºnkohlessen events has taken place since 2007 in Hamburg. In the Fish Auction Hall near the St. Pauli Landungsbr√ºcken several regional companies together with the food and drink industry organise a joint event, the so- called Gr√ºnkohl-Schlemmerfest, in which over 1500 paying guests take part. The Defftig Ollnborger Gr√∂√∂nkohl-√Ñten (\\"hearty Oldenburg kale feast\\") in Berlin, by contrast, is an event run by the political rural conservation group from Oldenburg Land in the capital city.

He was born and grew up in Rjukan. Around 1940 he was a sergeant in the Norwegian Army, and tried to repel the German invaders in April 1940, among others in a skirmish at Gransherad. He later joined the more irregular resistance movement. His most notable mission was the sinking of SF Hydro as a part of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage. After placing explosives below deck in the ferry, the saboteurs had to wait until the ferry's departure in the morning to oversee that nothing went against the plan. After witnessing the ferry leave harbor in a normal way, Lier-Hansen fled the scene for Einar Skinnarland's house. The ferry went down in the middle of Lake Tinn, and in addition to sabotaging the heavy water program, eighteen lives (fourteen civilians) were lost. When the war between Germany and Norway was over, on 8 May 1945, Lier-Hansen was dispatched together with Henry Johansen and another person to arrest Reichskommissar f√ºr die besetzten Norwegischen Gebiete Josef Terboven. The Norwegians reached Skaugum where Terboven had entrenched himself, but they were warded off by guards.

The FCC was directed to create the plan by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and unveiled its plan on March 16, 2010. The act did not give the FCC specific jurisdiction to carry out a national broadband plan or to amend the universal service provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, but it required that the FCC draft a plan to \\"include a detailed strategy for achieving affordability and maximizing use of broadband to advance consumer welfare, civic participation, public safety and homeland security, community development, health care delivery, energy independence and efficiency, education, employee training, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activity, job creation and economic growth, and other national purposes.\\" An official website for the plan, broadband.gov, highlighted energy and environment features. Other goals listed were \\"21st century care\\", \\"economic opportunity\\", \\"health care\\", \\"civic engagement\\" and \\"public safety\\". Broadband maps, tests and reporting of \\"broadband dead zones\\" were also featured. Another goal was providing 100 million American households with access to 100 Mbit/s (megabits per second) connections by 2020. Large areas of the United States would be wired for Internet access, and the federal Rural Utilities Service providing some rural areas with landline telephone service would be upgraded. The plan called for broadcasters to give up spectrum for wireless broadband access. The author of the requirement to draw up the plan, U.S. Representative Edward J. Markey (D-MA) praised the FCC's plan as a \\"roadmap\\" that would \\"ensure that every American has access to the tools they need to succeed.\\" The Obama administration promoted the plan, and former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, named the plan \\"his top priority\\". Details = Goals = The goals of the plan are described on broadband.gov: # At least 100 million U.S. homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second by the year 2020. # The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation, with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation. # Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service, and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose. # Every American community should have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings. # To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to a nationwide, wireless, interoperable broadband public safety network. # To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real-time energy consumption. =Spectrum reallocation= The plan also aimed to reallocate spectrum to increase capacity of mobile broadband, in response to increased demand. Cisco Systems reported that \\"global mobile data traffic grew 2.6-fold in 2010, nearly tripling for the third year in a row.\\" AT&T; Mobility reported that usage of its data network increased 8000% between 2007 and 2010, a time period concurrent with the release of the iPhone. In a report presented at the 2010 Mobile Future Forum, Peter Rysavy presented the dangers of not allocating additional spectrum. He predicted that without a reallocation, demand would exceed supply in 3‚Äì4 years, and noted that many minority and lower-income people depend on mobile internet as a primary connection. The plan recommends that 300 MHz of spectrum to be made newly available for commercial use over 5 years and 500 MHz after 10 years. The plan targets space between 225 MHz and 3.7 GHz; 120 MHz of Broadcast TV and 90 MHz of mobile satellite service. To fulfill this plan, the FCC must identify spaces in spectrum that can be used more effectively and then reclaim spectrum from incumbent licensees. The plan recommends that the FCC be given more authority to create new incentives to liberate spectrum. The FCC's basic approach would be to offer incentives to accelerate the process and avoid lengthy litigation proceedings. The spectrum auctions were authorized as part of the payroll tax cut extension passed by Congress on February 17, 2012. As the Plan reached its first anniversary, Congressional interest in the Plan's potential revenue from auctions increased, especially in light of Federal budget deficits. The wireless industry's main trade association, CTIA, and the Consumer Electronics Association, jointly released a report indicating that auctions from relinquished frequencies from broadcasters might garner $33 billion in revenue from auctions. = Energy management = FCC chairman Julius Genachowski said the broadband plan was a prerequisite for smart grid technology, which he expected to reduce power plants' greenhouse gas consumption by 12 percent, the same as if 55 million cars were no longer driven. Goal 6 of the plan stated that Americans should have the right to redirect live usage data securely to any energy demand management service provider they chose, for assistance in managing demand of all kinds (including potentially fossil fuel use, water and other utilities). Goal 6 implies access to demand-side opportunities such as turning on devices (such as sump or cistern pumps or battery chargers) that can use intermittent or off-peak power when it is available (more cheaply than at peak). In October 2009, General Electric and Whirlpool announced a Smart Green Grid Initiative. \\"Smart appliances\\" could schedule energy use at times when less energy was being used or when renewable energy such as wind was more available. To achieve Goal 6, appliances would need to communicate to the energy metering and management system and accept commands to change state. In 2010 AC power line communication in the home was considered an option. The plan recommendations, however, did not mention specific technologies for home networking. Reasons The U.S. has fallen behind Japan, the EU and South Korea in power grid technology, and has made it a national priority to improve its energy demand and supply management. The Pentagon has noted in several reports that reliance on oil and other diplomatically dangerous sources is a growing US national security concern. Consuming more energy per unit productivity than any other developed nation is no longer an option for the US according to the Obama administration which has made it a high priority to implement 'smart grid' technologies that are impossible to deploy without secure reliable and universal wired networking. The prior Bush administration had made powerline networking a priority to ensure that broadband access would be at least co-extant with the power grid's reach. More generally, as of December 2012, only about 65 percent of Americans had broadband access. The United States ranks 16th in the world, with South Korea at 95 percent and Singapore at 88 percent. Genachowski said over 20 countries had plans for broadband access, and that the lack of access in rural and low-income areas in the United States resulted in \\"leaving millions behind\\". By 2020, the goal was for 100 million households to have access to 100 Mbit/s service. 200 million people had broadband in 2009 (nationwide, the average connection speed was 3.9 Mbit/s), up from 8 million in 2000. But 14 million have no access whatsoever to broadband. An FCC survey, \\"Broadband Adoption and Use in America,\\" gave the average price of broadband access as $41/month, and said 36 percent those non- users surveyed said the service was too expensive. 12 percent lacked skills, 10 percent worried about \\"safety and privacy\\", and 19 percent were just not interested. One way to increase access would be to provide a block of spectrum to service providers who agreed to offer free or low-cost service to certain subscribers. One way to pay for this would be to transfer $15.5 billion to a Connect America Fund for areas not adequately served. This money would come from the Universal Service Fund created for telephone service for individuals and Internet access for schools and libraries. In addition, a Mobility Fund would provide funds for states to offer their own broadband programs. Also, Digital Literacy Corps would help people learn about the Internet in areas with low usage rates. And broadband would be added to the FCC's Lifeline and Link-Up program to provide phone service to the poor. Opposition The FCC has been quoted as saying the plan could cost anywhere from $20 billion to $350 billion, and these costs only take into account the cost of implementing the system and getting it up and running, not the costs of maintaining it in the future. Some other costs to take into account are the cost of the National Emergency Response Network, which officials have said will cost at least $12 billion to $16 billion to build. Another cost that must be taken into account is the cost of subsidizing materials like computers for households that cannot afford them. Those citizens would then need to receive training on how to use the computers and Internet effectively. All of these costs are going to add up to many billions of dollars. There have been several suggestions for ways in which the United States will pay for this plan. The first part involves taking the $4.6 billion per year that is allocated for the Universal Service Fund, and moving it to a fund under a new name that would continue providing subsidized phone service, but also work on getting broadband internet to those who currently do not have it. This will help offset the costs, but the regulators will have to make sure that there are still enough of those funds going toward providing the same amount of supported phone service, including rural landline and wireless services, as before. This money will help offset some of the costs of the implementation, but if it is in fact going to be closer to $350 billion, then that will not be enough money to cover the costs of the project. This will leave the rest of the cost burden on the government, who may in turn place it on the citizens as a tax. Aside from the cost, there is also an argument that the creation of a National Broadband Plan will stunt the growth of the industry and new technologies. Economist Robert Atkinson argues that such a plan will reduce the desire for companies to offer lower prices, better products, and better customer service, as well as lessening incentive to come up with new and innovative ideas. As the FCC has moved into the implementation stage of its plan, the jurisdictional question has arisen as to whether Congress provided the FCC with authority to implement the plan, or whether ARRA solely granted the agency authority to draft the plan. Commenters and state officials have raised the question of how agency proposals can be implemented so as to ensure rural areas do not experience deterioration or price spikes for existing telephone and cellular services. Commenters have expressed concern that if current support provided to rural areas in accordance with the Communications Act is moved to a much smaller subset of areas for broadband deployment, the currently supported rural areas will be deprived of much needed service coverage and affordable pricing. The FCC has proposed supporting only one provider per area, which commenters have stated would waste the universal service funds that have been invested in infrastructure other providers have already deployed in rural areas, and would result in a single monopoly service provider in many rural areas. This could mean some rural areas would end up with no telephone service or no cellular service, depending on which technology is supplied by the auction winner. Regulatory framework The FCC considered broadband to be an \\"information service\\" and, therefore, \\"lightly regulated\\". Although the commission believed this status gave the ability to impose the necessary restrictions in order to implement the plan, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said this was not the case, in an April 2010 ruling. In 2007, Kevin J. Martin, FCC chairman at the time, ordered Comcast to allow the use of BitTorrent, which Comcast considered to be competition to its cable business. Comcast argued that with deregulation under George W. Bush, the FCC had no authority to make such decisions. The United States Supreme Court sided with Comcast in 2005, and in a related ruling on April 6, 2010, the Appeals Court denied FCC's 2008 cease and desist order. As a result, FCC chairman Julius Genachowski wanted to redefine broadband as a \\"common carrier\\", requiring equal access to all traffic as on roads. On May 6, 2010, Genachowski said rules for broadband companies would be less strict than intended, in order to keep the FCC from appearing \\"heavy-handed\\". Republicans in the United States Congress and at the FCC, and cable and telephone companies were expected to oppose the regulations necessary to make the broadband plan work. Network neutrality, for example, would require broadband providers to allow competitors to use their lines for telephone service, streaming video and other online services. However, Genachowski said networks would not be required to share with the competition. Three of the five commissioners would have to approve the regulations. Genachowski, a Democrat, believed the other two Democratic FCC commissioners would support him. Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, a Democratic member of the House committee overseeing the FCC, supported the proposal, saying the FCC needed to make sure consumers and businesses were protected. The two Republican FCC commissioners, Robert McDowell and Meredith Baker, feared \\"burdensome rules excavated from the early-Ma Bell-monopoly era onto 21st century networks\\" which would prevent companies from making the necessary investments to improve their networks. House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio called the plan \\"a government takeover of the Internet.\\" Genachowski said regulations would \\"support policies that advance our global competitiveness and preserve the Internet as a powerful platform for innovation.\\" History =Survey by NTIA (2008)= In the Federal Communications Commission's Fifth Report before Congress,http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-08-88A1.doc released in June 2008, the FCC reported:''' > Based on our analysis in this Report, we conclude that the deployment of > advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans is reasonable and > timely. The data reflect the industry's extensive investment in broadband > deployment, including at higher speeds, as evidenced by increased > subscribership for those higher-speed services. The report stated that 47% of adult Americans had access in the home, rural home broadband adoption was at 31%, and over 57.8 million U.S. households subscribed to broadband at home. The NTIA contended that universal, affordable access was being provided in the home, workplace, classroom, and library. When measuring subscription rates of low-income areas, the survey reported that \\"92 percent of the lowest-income zip codes have at least one high-speed subscriber, compared with 99.4 percent of the highest-income zip codes.\\" However, criticism came from within the FCC itself. Then FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein disagreed with this conclusion citing the \\"downward trend\\" of the country's broadband ranking, and Commission Michael Copps criticized the FCC's data collection methods. =OECD Survey= In 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released statistics on broadband deployment. These statistics raised concerns that the U.S. may be lagging in broadband rollout, adoption, and pricing when compared to other developed nations. The United States ranked 15th out of 30 countries measured in broadband penetration; Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden, Korea and Finland were well-above the OECD average. The average download speed in the U.S. was 4.9 Mbit/s, while the OECD average was 9.2 Mbit/s. On the basis of these statistics, critics argued that the FCC's previous assessment was inaccurate and incomplete. In a paper addressing this issue, Rob Frieden argued that \\"the FCC and NTIA have overstated broadband penetration and affordability by using an overly generous and unrealistic definition of what qualifies as broadband service, by using zip codes as the primary geographic unit of measure, by failing to require measurements of actual as opposed to theoretical bitrates, and by misinterpreting available statistics.\\" =Schools= On June 6, 2013 at Mooresville Middle School in Mooresville, North Carolina, President Barack Obama announced plans for ConnectEd, a plan to provide high-speed Internet to many schools that did not already have it. Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, schools and libraries paid lower prices for telecommunications services, and Obama wanted the E-Rate program expanded to include Internet access. White House aides made the claim that only one-fifth of American students could use high-speed Internet at school, but all South Korea students could. Repeating a similar goal from 2008, Obama stated he would ask the FCC to \\"connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed broadband Internet within five years.\\" =Debate= Internet access has become a vital tool in development and social progress since the start of the 21st century. Broadband Internet penetration rates are now treated as key economic indicators with the United States widely perceived as falling behind in both its rate of broadband Internet penetration and the speed of its broadband infrastructure.\\"America: Land of the Slow\\", Verne G. Kopytoff, New York Times: Bits, 20 September 2011 As a result, there have been calls for the U.S. to develop, adopt, fund, and implement a National Broadband Plan. Proponents and opponents advance a number of arguments for and against the need for and advisability of creating such a plan.Mohney, D U.S. broadband adoption slows (again) in 2008; now more than 67M subs Retrieved on 2009-05-28 * Meeting important public needs: In the 21st century, Internet access is recognized as a basic utility similar to telephones, water, and electricity. Most agree Internet access is needed in order to fully participate in society. For example, in the 2008 presidential elections, candidates delivered weekly addresses through videos on the Internet. These videos were often not available anywhere else. Proponents of national broadband policy argue that situations like the 2008 presidential elections illustrate that broadband internet access is a vital commodity for complete civic engagement.Bringing Broadband to the Urban Poor BusinessWeek, p.1. 2008-12-31. Retrieved on 2009-01-19. * Entertainment: Broadband can provide entertainment in ways that television and radio cannot. Webisodes, mini-episodes that are not usually aired on cable television, are an example of this extension of traditional television. For example, Bravo has given users the opportunity to view \\"Top Chef\\" on their personal computers. An entertainment advantage of these Webisodes is the idea that the users are able to view the behind the scenes footage that occur after the contestants are kicked off the show.West, S. November 25, 2008. Top Chef Webisodes Premiere This Week This kind of extension of entertainment marks a change in the way we utilize internet access, and a hybridization of media. * Economic growth: Supporters of national broadband policy also argue that Internet access allows consumers to contribute to economic growth and innovation.The Case for a National Broadband Policy 2007-06. Retrieved on 2009-03-02. Many services have moved business onto the Internet, a shift that is manifested through tools such as online banking, account referencing for utilities, and online library databases. * Education: Those in favor of a national broadband policy also claim that many educational resources, including online classes and interactive learning simulations can only be found on the web. They believe that Internet access for all is necessary to create a truly American environment of equal opportunity.Bringing Broadband to the Urban Poor BusinessWeek, p.2. 2008-12-21. Retrieved on 2009-01-19. * Lifelong learning: Proponents of national broadband policy argue that online library databases, textbooks, and encyclopedias, have made the Internet a premier tool for education and lifelong learning. They maintain that the availability of broadband for all would provide a number of other highly valuable public benefits.Municipal Broadband: A Background Briefing Paper Broadband for All. 2006-09. Retrieved on 2009-02-19. * Rural access: Some in favor of a national broadband policy argue it will provide the infrastructure necessary to bring broadband Internet to rural areas of the United States. Many inhabitants of rural areas who are willing to pay for broadband service cannot get it.Bringing Broadband to Rural America BusinessWeek. 2008-09-18. Retrieved on 2009-03-04. Low population density causes high costs and low profits and prevents most providers from doing business in the rural United States. * Urban access: Proponents of national broadband policy believe that it would have a positive effect on the urban poor and provide them with many more opportunities for Internet access. In impoverished urban areas, many people are unable to afford the payments to bring broadband services into their homes. In 2008, roughly 50% of the United States population made an annual income of $50,000 or less. Of that half of the population, only 35% of the population could afford cost of monthly payments for broadband services. Some telecommunications companies have made a small effort to provide more affordable broadband rates for the 15% of the population that could not afford broadband before. However, non-profits like One Economy are the current primary source of funding used to provide low- income families with broadband access. * Healthcare: More citizens could research hospitals and physicians prior to traveling so as to receive better medical care (a benefit particularly important for those who live in rural areas and travel long distances for medical treatment). * Jobs: More citizens could research jobs and investments, providing more opportunities for economic stability. * Telecommuting: More citizens could work from home, which accommodates personal or health needs, as well as reduces the use of travel- related resources usually used for commuting. * Politics: More citizens could educate themselves on political issues, news, and other important civic issues, using the Internet to become more informed and/or more active. * Government / citizen communication: If all citizens had Internet access, the government would have a more efficient tool to communicate and interact with its citizens quickly and effectively, particularly in terms of processes currently executed on paper. Broadband could also help the government provide aid efficiently, particularly in areas affected by disasters. * Inefficiencies, stifled innovation and competition: Those against a national broadband policy argue that allowing the government to regulate and manage broadband development will cause efficiency and progress to wane, due to lack of competition.National Policy Would Be Bad for Broadband 2007-04-02. Retrieved on 2009-02-15. They also maintain that government involvement will inevitably result in profit losses for companies and businesses. * Possible government waste and lack of attention to real user needs: Opponents of national broadband policy warn that in an attempt to achieve the desired goal of broadband for all, the government will waste billions of dollars on an infrastructure that people do not need or cannot use. They believe the money will be ill-spent because the government will not give attention to customer needs and desires with the same specificity exercised by the corporate sector. * Negative effect on the economy: Furthermore, those who do not advocate a national broadband policy claim that increases in broadband coverage could have an unexpected negative effect on the United States economy. They believe that many service sector jobs currently based in the United States could be moved offshore and fulfilled by lower-wage foreign workers. Opponents thus suggest that the relationship between economic growth and broadband penetration is questionable, emphasizing the notion that statistics are often misleading. They do not believe that such statistics are an adequate indicator that a national broadband policy is needed in the United States. Implications  According to the plan, one hundred million Americans do not have broadband at home and the U.S. continues to lag in Internet access speed. The FCC brought out a plan and recommendations to address these problems, along with approaches to maximize the economic and social gains from broadband adoption. This plan is specializing the role of broadband in education, health care, energy and the environment, government performance, civic engagement, public safety, and economic opportunity. Also includes a recognition that broadband obtainment cannot occur without the active participation of the states. =Government= A number of recommendations have clear implications for policy action by state and local governments. On the basic issue of expanded access to broadband, the FCC recommendations include: *Congress should make clear that tribal, state, regional and local governments can build broadband networks. (Recommendation 8.19) As private investors do not always have the strongest incentives to deploy broadband in rural and underserved communities at an affordable price, states and local leaders should be allowed to step in to provide affordable broadband services that will meet their residents' needs. *Federal and state policies should facilitate demand aggregation and use of state, regional and local networks when that is the most cost-efficient solution for anchor institutions to meet their connectivity needs. (Recommendation 8.20) Pooling demand among institutions can provide more access to a wider constituency at lower prices. *State legislators are essential partners in developing the framework that will help anchor institutions to obtain broadband connectivity, training, applications, and services. (Recommendation 8.22) States should complement broadband deployment with digital education programs and fund community technology centers to ensure that residents of all ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and ages understand how to be producers as well as consumers of this new media economy. *When feasible, Congress should consider allowing state and local governments to get lower service prices by participating in federal contracts for advanced communications services. (Recommendation 14.2) *The FCC plan provides additional recommendations for the inclusion of tribal leaders in broadband programs, construction of new networks in areas that are currently un-served, and the establishment of the Connect America Fund to address the broadband availability gap in un-served areas. The FCC recommendations also focused on helping states make broadband more affordable and increasing the training needed to encourage adoption, including: *An expansion of the Lifeline Assistance and Link-Up America programs, where states already have these discount programs in place, as in Vermont, the FCC recommends letting states determine their own eligibility requirements. *The creation of a National Digital Literacy Program to increase the skills needed to participate in the digital economy. *The collection of more comprehensive and reliable information on broadband pricing, performance, and competition in specific market segments to better inform policymakers on affordability problems in specific communities. =Political= \\"Public policy makers throughout the world are faced with the need to update, replace, and/or revise existing regulations that govern the relationships between and among traditional video distribution platforms, such as over-the-air and cable/satellite providers, as the internet emerges as a viable video distribution platform.\\" See also * Broadband universal service * Broadband mapping in the United States * Policies promoting wireless broadband in the United States References External links * Official government web site * Announcing the National Broadband Plan video by Julius Genachowski, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, at broadband.gov Category:Wireless networking Category:Broadband Category:Presidency of Barack Obama Category:Internet in the United States Category:Federal Communications Commission ","title":"National Broadband Plan (United States)"},{"id":"26710555","text":"The Divine Spark is a 1935 British musical film directed by Carmine Gallone and starring Marta Eggerth, Phillips Holmes, Benita Hume and Donald Calthrop.

The aircraft chosen as the basis for the testbed was the Anderson Greenwood AG-14, a single-engined, twin-boom pusher light aircraft that had been built in small numbers in the late 1940s and early 1960s. The type was already familiar to Mississippi State University, as it had used one to test ducted propellers. Initially, a simple conversion, to be designated MA-18, was planned, but it was later decided to make the test bed more closely resemble the final full- scale aircraft, with the resultant changes causing re-designation to MA-18A. It was later named \\"Marvelette\\", and received the military serial number 62-12147 and the US Army designation XAZ-1.Heyman 1990, p.50.Matt, Paul R. \\"Anderson Greenwood AG-14 and the MARVEL program\\". Retrieved 31 December 2009. The Marvelette was a high-winged monoplane with an aluminium monocoque rear fuselage and a glassfibre nose. The twin tailbooms of the AG-14 were replaced by the propeller duct, which incorporated movable segments of its trailing edge to replace the rudder and elevator and a non-retractable tricycle undercarriage was fitted. The new wing was made of glassfibre and incorporated the camber-changing mechanism and perforations to allow suction for boundary layer control. Operational history After making its maiden flight on 16 November 1962, the Marvelette was used in an extensive test program to evaluate the aircraft and its novel features. The aircraft retained the original Continental C-90 engine of the AG-14, which powered the boundary control system as well as providing the propulsion for the aircraft. As the Marvellette was heavier than the original AG-14, the engine proved to be underpowered for its task. Nevertheless, the test successfully evaluated the novel features planned for the Marvel. The full-sized aircraft had a modified camber-changing mechanism and more conventional tail control surfaces. The Marvelette completed 25 test flights, with the last flight in March 1964, and was subsequently the platform for Marvel development ground tests before being dismantled.Heyman 1990, pp. 50‚Äì51.

The company was founded in Revere, Massachusetts, by William Henry Grueby (Boston 1867‚ÄîNew York 1925), who had been inspired by the matte glazes on French pottery and the refined simplicity of Japanese ceramics he had seen at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago the previous year, and the architect-designer William Graves.Barbara Bell, \\"The Potteries of New England, Part IV: Grueby\\" (on-line) During its first years, Grueby produced glazed architectural terra cotta and faience tiles.

Grueby Faience stood in the mainstream of Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau design in the United States. Graves and Kendrick were eventually replaced by the architect Addison LeBoutillier and Henry Belknap, who had worked with Louis Comfort Tiffany. Later, Karl Langenbeck, formerly of the Rookwood Pottery, would superintend design.Bell. Soon Grueby vases were for sale at Samuel Bing's shop in Paris, L'Art Nouveau, which gave a name to the progressive art movement, and through Tiffany & Co. in New York, where Tiffany Studios used Grueby lamp bases.

Holmes is known as the last of the Bentonia bluesmen, as he is the last blues musician to play the Bentonia School. Like Skip James and Jack Owens and other blues musicians from Bentonia, Mississippi, Holmes learned to play the blues from Henry Stuckey, the originator of the Bentonia blues. Holmes' music is based in the Bentonia tuning utilizing open E-minor, open D-minor and a down tuned variant, and is noted for its haunting, ethereal, rhythmic and hypnotic qualities. His eighth album, It Is What It Is, on Blue Front Records has been praised by fans and music critics who have called it: \\"addictive\\" and \\"obsession worthy,\\" \\"as gritty, stark and raw as one could imagine\\" and \\"absolutely hypnotic,\\" and \\"an essential modern recording.\\" Early life Jimmy Charles Holmes was born in Yazoo County, Mississippi, United States, to Carey and Mary Holmes at their home in Bentonia, Mississippi. Holmes' parents were sharecroppers, who opened the Blue Front Cafe in 1948, the year after he was born. They had ten children, but also raised four grandchildren when one of their daughters died. Musical influences Holmes' was first taught how to play the Bentonia School by Henry Stuckey, the man who created the unique style of blues after he returned to Bentonia, Mississippi after World War I. Stuckey moved next door to Holmes and the young Holmes would hear Stuckey playing on his front porch. Around 1957, Holmes picked up Stuckey's guitar and started to learn. Carey Holmes bought Jimmy his first guitar, a yellow and black plastic toy guitar for Christmas. While Holmes would occasionally play with an uncle's electric guitar when he visited his uncle in New York City in the 1960s, it was not until the 1970s that Holmes bought his first guitar, a small acoustic guitar from Radio Shack. That original guitar is on permanent display at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Mississippi. During the 1970s, Bentonia blues musicians, Jack Owens, Cornelius Bright, Tommy West, Adam Slater, Dodd Stuckey (Henry Stuckey's brother), and Jacob Stuckey, (Henry Stuckey's cousin), came to the Blue Front Cafe to play. Slater, Bright and West initially started to teach Holmes how to play, but it took the arrival of Jack Owens at the Blue Front Cafe on a regular basis in the 1980s, before Holmes fully grasped the style. Owens came to the Blue Front several times a week and Holmes sat outside with him and learned how to play such songs as \\"Hard Times Killing Floor Blues\\", \\"Devil Got My Woman\\", \\"Cherry Ball\\", and \\"Catfish.\\" At the same time, Tommy West, a Hill country blues musician was also teaching Holmes how to play in that idiom. Holmes eventually incorporated some of the techniques he learned from West into his own playing, including using the low E string for a droning bass line. Professional career Holmes was initially recorded by several people in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Alan Lomax and David Evans. The earliest known released recording of Holmes was \\"Devil's Blues\\" that he recorded with Cornelius Bright for Evans. It appeared in 1991 on a Wolf Records compilation album, Giants of the Country Blues Guitar - Vol. 2. In the 1980s, Holmes began performing at the Bentonia Blues Festival that Holmes and his mother, Mary Holmes, started in 1972 as a community event that grew into one of the longest running blues festivals in the country. Holmes also started playing other blues festivals across Mississippi, the United States, Europe and South America including the Chicago Blues Festival, Waterfront Blues Festival, Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, Muddy Roots Music Festival, Briggs Farm Blues Festival, amongst others. In 2003, Holmes recorded his first album over the course of three days at the Pluto Plantation for Shade Tree Records. It was a blues label started by Peter Lee, although the company folded before it ever released the recordings. Then in October 2005, Jeff Konkel visited the Blue Front Cafe and returned on November 17, 2005, to record Holmes. Those recordings were released in 2006 as Back to Bentonia on CD as Holmes's debut release and the first release by Broke and Hungry Records. The album featured some traditional Bentonia Blues songs as well as original compositions. Holmes was awarded two Living Blues Awards for Back to Bentonia, including Best Debut Blues Album and Best Acoustic Blues Album. Konkel was awarded Producer of the Year for 2006. In 2007, Broke and Hungry Records released Holmes' second CD entitled, Done Got Tired of Tryin' . The CD received additional critical acclaim and was named one of the top 10 Blues Albums of 2007 by WXPN, World Cafe and was nominated for a Blues Music Award. In 2008, Fat Possum Records released Gonna Get Old Someday consisting of those original tracks Holmes recorded in 2003 for Shade Tree Records. In 2010, Broke and Hungry Records released Holmes' fourth album, Ain't It Lonesome. Since Holmes started his recording career, he has appeared in documentaries, television programs and radio programs. In 2008, Holmes and the Blue Front Cafe were featured in the documentary M for Mississippi produced by Konkel and Roger Stolle. On October 22, 2012, Holmes appeared with Terry \\"Harmonica\\" Bean at World Cafe Live on WXPN as part of the Mississippi Blues Project. He appeared in the 2015 documentary film I Am the Blues.

The Amazons qualified for the final that year but were defeated. The team was owned by Frank Patrick, who also owned the Vancouver Millionaires. Patrick would organize a tournament featuring the Amazons, the Seattle Vamps and the Victoria Kewpies. The Amazons went undefeated in the tournament and did not allow a goal. The Amazons were West Coast Women's champions. As the tournament featured a team from the United States, many consider this the first ever international women's hockey competition. At the Banff tournament in 1922 Elizabeth Hinds became the first woman from British Columbia to score a hat trick in a game. Phebe Senkler was captain of the Amazons and her sister Norah played on defense. The forwards were Kathleen Carson and Nan Griffith, while the goaltender was Amelia Voitkevic. The bench featured Lorraine Cannon and Mayme Leahy. The Amazons qualified for the 1922 final and played the Calgary Regents.

Situated at Coleorton, Leicestershire, it is a Grade II* listed building now converted into residential apartments. The manor of Coleorton was acquired by the Beaumont family by marriage in the 15th century. Henry Beaumont, High Sheriff of Leicestershire was knighted in 1603. His son Thomas was created a baronet in 1619 and was raised to the Peerage as Viscount Beaumont of Swords, Dublin in 1622. On the death of the third Viscount in 1702 the estate passed to a distant cousin Sir George Beaumont, 4th Baronet of Stoughton Grange who was Member of Parliament for Leicester 1702-37. Following his death in 1737 and that of his brother in 1738, the estate and baronetcy passed to a cousin George Beaumont, of Great Dunmow, Essex. His son Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet rebuilt the old manor house in about 1804 to a design by architect George Dance the Younger. The grounds were laid out by Uvedale Price. Under the 7th Baronet, a patron of the arts whose collection formed the foundation of the National Gallery, Coleorton Hall's regular guests included William Wordsworth (who designed the Winter Garden in 1806), Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sir Walter Scott and John Constable. In 1848, two extensions, the Picture Gallery and Beaumont Room, with its ornate ceiling panels, were added. The ninth baronet, High Sheriff in 1852, substantially remodelled the house in about 1862, with the assistance of architect FP Cockerell, adding another storey. The main entrance front has three storeys and five bays, with an off centre porte-cochere leading to a vaulted porch within a canted full height bay. In 1948 the Beaumonts sold the house to the National Coal Board for use as offices. In the early 1990s the hall was rented to Fison's Pharmaceuticals. Both the Uk Operation and EMEA Sales management moved into the hall after relocating from other Fison's offices mainly based in Loughborough. The Hall was redecorated and refurbished after it was seen to be a little run down. In 1997 it was sold for redevelopment and converted into residential apartments.

It was approved for industrial applications in the European Union on 2 March 2010 by the European Commission. In January 2012, the potato was withdrawn from the market in the EU. History Originally registered on , Amflora was developed by geneticist Lennart Erjef√§lt and agronomist J√ºri K√§nno of Sval√∂f Weibull AB. After the European Commission's approval of the potato, BASF announced it was going to produce Amflora seed starting in April 2010 in Germany's Western Pomerania (20 ha) and Sweden (80 ha). It also announced it was planting 150 ha in the Czech Republic \\"for commercial aims with an unnamed partner.\\" Due to lack of acceptance of GM crops in Europe, BASF Plant Science decided in January 2012 to stop its commercialization activities in Europe and would no longer sell Amflora there, but it would continue seeking regulatory approval for its products in the Americas and Asia.James Kanter for The New York Times. January 16, 2012. BASF to Stop Selling Genetically Modified Products in Europe In 2013, an EU court annulled the approval of BASF's Amflora, saying that the EU Commission broke rules when it approved the potato in 2010. Biology Waxy potato varieties produce two main kinds of potato starch, amylose and amylopectin, the latter of which is most industrially useful. The Amflora potato has been modified to contain antisense RNA against the enzyme that drives synthesis of amylose, namely granule bound starch synthase. This resulting potato almost exclusively produces amylopectin, and thus is more useful for the starch industry.  Industrial applications  Regular potato starch contains two constituent types of molecules: amylopectin (80 percent), which is more useful as a polymer for industry, and amylose (20 percent) which often creates problems as starch retrogradation, so must be modified with chemical reactions which can be costly.http://www.basf.com/group/corporate/en/function/conversions:/publish/content/products- and-industries/biotechnology/plant- biotechnology/images/BASF_Plant_Science_Amflora.pdf After two decades of research efforts, BASF's biotechnologists using genetic engineering succeeded in creating a potato, named \\"Amflora\\", where the gene responsible for the synthesis of amylose had been turned off, thus the potato is unable to synthesize the less desirable amylose. Amflora potatoes would be processed and sold as starch to industries that prefer waxy potato starch with only amylopectin. Amflora is intended only for industrial applications such as papermaking and other technical applications. Europe produces more than two million metric tons of natural potato starch a year, and BASF with its Amflora product hoped to enter into this large market. = Other possible uses = According to The New York Times, BASF has a second application pending for use of Amflora's potato pulp as animal feed.  Political disagreements  Protests against the Amflora potato Various environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, disagreed with the introduction of the Amflora genetically modified potato into the market. The lengthy approval process frustrated some supporters of the potato. A BASF scientist said to The New York Times, \\"it's hard when you see an innovative product go through the loops again and again. These decisions are not about science but about politics\\". After the potato was approved, the European Greens political party and the Italian agricultural minister criticized the approval. The International Peasant Movement La Via Campesina issued a press release on 8 March 2010 also criticizing the decision.http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=881:gm- potatoamflora-commission-defies-farmers-and- biodiversity&catid;=22:biodiversity-and-genetic-resources&Itemid;=37 = Reactions by Greek politicians = After Amflora's licensing by the European Commission on 2 March 2010, the Coalition of the Radical Left's Member of Parliament for the A Thessalonikis prefecture, Tasos Kouvelis, asked the Greek Minister of Agriculture on 3 March 2010 to declare the production of the potato illegal in Greece,.http://www.kourakis.gr/question/ŒùŒ±-Œ±œÄŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒµœÖœÑŒµŒØ-Œ∑- Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±-œÑŒ∑œÇ-ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ-œÄŒ±œÑŒ¨œÑŒ±œÇ-Amflora-Œ±œÄœå-œÑŒøœÖœÇ-Œ±Œ≥œÅœåœÑŒµœÇ-œÑŒ∑œÇ-œáœéœÅŒ±œÇ-Œº On 4 March 2010 Panhellenic Socialist Movement's European Member of Parliament Kriton Arsenis submitted a question at Europarl asking about the consequences of Amflora.http://kepka.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1183&Itemid;=27 PASOK's MP Maria Damanaki accepted the decision of the European Commission, while Greek Agriculture Minister Katerina Batzeli said the production of Amflora will not be allowed in Greece.http://www.naftemporiki.gr/news/pstory.asp?id=1784971  Licensing procedure  Amflora could not be sold within the European Union without approval, and its licence could only be issued after voting at the Council of Ministers of the European Union with a 74 percent threshold of support. Two rounds of voting were held, first by experts in December 2006 and then by the agricultural ministers in July 2007, but both failed to reach the 74 percent threshold.

Later he became the national secretary, national chairman, and a senior politician in the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Biography Dr. Okwesilieze is a member of the Nwodo political dynasty. He is the second son of Igwe J.U. Nwodo, a traditional ruler who hailed from Ukehe, in Enugu State. J.U. was appointed Minister of Commerce in the former Eastern Region under Premier Michael Okpara, and was subsequently Minister of Local Government. Nwodo studied medicine at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1971‚Äì77). Between 1977 and 1980, he was a house officer at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu and at the Military Hospital in Jos. He continued his studies at the Royal College of Surgeons, London (1980) and the Belgrade Medical School, Yugoslavia (1980‚Äì84), gaining an MB.BS in Medicine and Surgery. He worked as a pediatric surgeon in Yugoslavia and then in Birmingham, England, before returning to Nigeria and taking a post as Medical Doctor at the Ukehe Medical Centre and Maternity (1984-1991).

He held office until November 1993, when General Sani Abacha came to power in a military coup. He was twice elected Secretary General of People's Democratic Party (PDP) in 1999-2001. In October 2001, he was replaced by Vincent Ogbulafor as PDP party secretary. He fell out with Enugu State governor Chimaroke Nnamani in 2002. In December 2003, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission announced that it was investigating Nwodo and others in connection with a multi-billion naira bribery scandal related to the National Identity Card scheme. In 2007, he was awarded a national honor, Commander of the Niger (CON), by President Shehu Yar'Adua. In 2010, he was elected National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. In 2010, he was cleared of all charges on the Identity Card scandal. In 2014, The Beta Sigma Fraternity International elected Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo, former Governor of Enugu State, as its President for the next two years. In his acceptance speech, Nwodo, enjoined all members to live up to the high ideals for which the Beta Sigma was formed in Nigeria. He stated that \\"at a time when our society is plagued by socio-economic problems and security challenges, members should extend hand of fellowship to the less-privileged and the poor in our communities. He is a brother to Chief John Nnia Nwodo, who was Minister of Aviation under President Shehu Shagari, and again Minister of Information under President Abdusalami Abubakar.

It is based on the 1942 book Victory Through Air Power by Alexander P. de Seversky. De Seversky appeared in the film, an unusual departure from the Disney animated feature films of the time.Markenstein, Don. \\"Victory Through Air Power.\\" toonopedia.com, Don Markenstein's Toonopedia. Retrieved: May 12, 2009. Edward H. Plumb, Paul J. Smith and Oliver Wallace were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Production Popular filmmaker Walt Disney read Victory through Air Power and felt that its message was so important that he personally financed the animated production of the book.Gabler 2006, p. 390. The film was primarily created to express Seversky's theories to government officials and the public. Movie critic Richard Schickel says that Disney \\"pushed the film out in a hurry, even setting aside his distrust of limited animation under the impulses of urgency\\" (the only obvious use of limited animation, however, is in diagrammatic illustrations of Seversky's talking points. These illustrations featured continuous flowing streams of iconic aircraft, forming bridges or shields, and munitions flowing along assembly lines). It was not until 1945 Disney was able to pay off his $1.2 million war film deficit. After Disney's main distributor at the time RKO Radio Pictures refused to release the film in theaters, Walt decided to have United Artists (the distributor of many of his shorts between 1932 and 1937) release it instead, making it the first and only Disney animated feature to be released by a different movie studio. Reception On July 11, 1943, the New York Times devoted a half page, \\"Victory from the Air,\\" to a feature consisting of pictures of scenes from the film with short captions. This was possibly the first time that such skilled use of visual description had been placed at the service of an abstract political argument. Schickel quotes film critic James Agee as hoping that: Impact A still from Victory Through Air Power, showing a rocket‚Äìbomb destroying a Nazi German U-boat pen On December 8, 1941, Disney studios were essentially converted into a propaganda machine for the United States government. While most World War II films were created for training purposes, films such as Victory Through Air Power were created to catch the attention of government officials and to build public morale among the U.S. and Allied powers.\\"Disney goes to war.\\" skylighters.org. Retrieved: September 16, 2011. Among the notables who decided after seeing the film that Seversky and Disney knew what they were talking about were Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt.Gooch 1995, p. 16. The Disney studio sent a print for them to view when they were attending the Quebec Conference. According to Leonard Maltin, \\"it changed FDR's way of thinking‚Äîhe agreed that Seversky was right.\\" Maltin also adds that \\"it was only after Roosevelt saw 'Victory Through Air Power' that our country made the commitment to long-range bombing\\", although that is incorrect as the Allied Combined Bomber Offensive had already begun on June 10, 1943, two months before Roosevelt saw the movie.Maltin, Leonard. \\"Introduction to Victory Through Air Power.\\" Walt Disney Treasures: On the Front Lines, [Collector's Tin], Dir. Walt Disney, 1941‚Äì44, DVD, Disney, 2004, Time code: 03:46‚Äì04:12. Roosevelt recognized that film was an effective way to teach and Disney could provide Washington with high quality information. The American people were becoming united and Disney was able to inform them of the situation without presenting excessive chaos, as cartoons often do. The animation was popular among soldiers and was superior to other documentary films and written instructions at the time.Combs 1984, p. 35. The film played a significant role for the Disney Corporation because it was the true beginning of educational films. The educational films would be, and still are, continually produced and used for the military, schools, and factory instruction. The company learned how to effectively communicate their ideas and efficiently produce the films while introducing the Disney characters to millions of people worldwide. Throughout the rest of the war, Disney characters effectively acted as ambassadors to the world. In addition to Victory Through Air Power, Disney produced Donald Gets Drafted, Education for Death, Der Fuehrer's Face, and various training films for the military, reusing animation from Victory Through Air Power in some of them.\\"Walt Disney Goes to War\\". Life magazine, August 1942, pp. 61‚Äì69. One scene showed a fictional rocket bomb destroying a fortified German submarine pen. According to anecdote, this directly inspired the British to develop a real rocket bomb to attack targets that were heavily protected with thick concrete. Due to its origin, the weapon became known as the Disney bomb, and saw limited use before the war ended.Spillman 1997, p. 75. In retrospect, some of Seversky's proposals were derided as impractical, such as operating a major long-range air bombardment campaign from the Aleutians, a series of islands reaching westward from Alaska, which is a remote area with a highly volatile climate that makes for dangerous flying conditions.Tillman 2010, p. 23. Home media After its release and re-release in 1943 and 1944, there was no theatrical release for 60 years, perhaps because it was seen as propaganda, or perhaps because it was deemed offensive to Germans and Japanese.\\"Walt Disney on the Front Lines DVD Review.\\" UltimateDisney.Com, May 8, 2004.

Chinese Nationalist forces aimed to retake the Burma Road. Background The Japanese Army in Southern Yunnan was at risk of being cut off by advancing British and American troops in Northern Burma. The Japanese Army aimed to block the highway for as long as possible. Constructing a series of tunnels and bunkers over a static two-year period they turned the mountain and its immediate environs into a fortress. Songshan (in Chinese) Matsuyama (in Japanese) blocked the road immediately behind the Salween River. Although the Chinese Nationalist Army crossed the river with light casualties and surrounded the Japanese garrison, they found that their offensive capability was limited because of this garrison behind their line of advance. The Chinese forces were unaware of the depth of the Japanese defences, and their underestimation led to heavy casualties through a slow and cautious campaign. Chinese artillery strikes and US bombing runs had little effect against Japanese forces underground. Japan also set up a series of hidden pillboxes to ambush the Chinese forces. After three months of battle, the Chinese forces finally retook Mount Song through the use of extended bombardment and an overabundance of US aid and training, as well as several tons of U.S. TNT placed in tunnels beneath the fortifications. Once open the Burma Road could be used to supply China with aid via a land route. Fall and Aftermath The Japanese listed only one survivor, Captain Kinoshita, an artillery officer and one other soldier ordered out to communicate to the Japanese high command the night before the fall of the outpost, with apparently one other soldier. Chinese sources say 7 soldiers were captured out of the total garrison, Japanese sources do not mention prisoners. Comfort Station Upon the exhortations of Senior Staff Officer Masanobu Tsuji, a comfort station was established in early 1944. About 12 Japanese comfort women committed suicide towards the end of the siege after fighting alongside the Japanese garrison. Another five or six Korean comfort women were captured by Chinese and US forces. These were eventually repatriated.The Chrysamthemum and the Dragon, Sagara Jyunsuke, Kojinsha Press, Tokyo 2004, Ëèä„Å®ÈæçÁ•ñÂõΩ„Å∏„ÅÆÊ†ÑÂÖâ„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ„ÄÅÂÖâ‰∫∫Á§æ„ÄÅÊù±‰∫¨„ÄÅÔºíÔºêÔºê4 Significance After the capture of the stronghold, the Burma Road could be used once again to supply China.

The tree in which King Charles II is famously thought to have hidden stood in between Lower Wick and Powick by the River Teme. Southwick Lodge on the Old Road to Powick is a Grade II listed 1830s villa. Lower Wick's location less than 1 mile north-west of the confluence between the Severn and the Teme mean it is often affected by flooding. During the July 2007 floods, all main roads in and out of Lower Wick and St John's were closed due to floodwater. Lower Wick has a golf course and a swimming pool. One of two Churches of Latter Day Saints in Worcestershire is located in Lower Wick. There is also a non-denominational church, a petrol station and a number of other shops.

He rose to the rank of major general while serving until World War II. Early life Joseph Marie Xavier de S√©vin was born on 10 March 1894 in Toulouse, France. His education progressed to military schooling. World War I service =1914= De S√©vin was in the special military school at St. Cyr in 1914. He volunteered for active military service on 2 September 1914. His first assignment was as an enlisted man in the 14e Regiment d'Infanterie. He then began a series of rapid promotions. On 5 November 1914, he was promoted to Corporal; on 30 November, to Sergeant; on 5 December, he was commissioned a temporary Sous lieutenant. =1915= On 15 July 1915, de S√©vin reported to Pau for pilot's training. On 19 October 1915, he was awarded Pilot's Brevet No. 1804. On 11 November, he was assigned to Escadrille N12 to pilot both single-seat and two-seat Nieuports. He was confirmed in his commission on 27 December 1915. =1916-1917= He would not score his first aerial victory until 11 July 1916. His second was eight months later, when he shared a claim with Marcel Nogues on 4 March 1917. He was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur on 19 April 1917. On 11 May, he teamed with Alfred Auger for a third win, over a two-seater. On 19 June, he shared a victory with Jacques Ortoli and Jean Chaput. By 30 September, his string was up to six, with five of the wins shared. On 25 December, he was given command of Escadrille Spa26, accompanied by a promotion to lieutenant. =1918= He tallied up another six wins between 20 January 1918 and 24 October 1918, including one shared with Andre Dubonnet. During this stretch, he was appointed temporary Captain on 2 March 1918, and confirmed in the rank on 28 June. Post World War I service De S√©vin continued in service after the war, becoming a professional soldier. At some point, de S√©vin served in Morocco, at Istres; he also was the French Air Attach√© in Bucharest. De S√©vin commanded a flying school during World War II, and was in North Africa in 1943.

Fiesta features an anime style characters rendered in 3D. Fiesta Online was originally published in 2003 but was later published by Outspark and subsequently taken over by Gamigo AG.  Publication and Development  The game was developed by Ons On SOFT Ltd.http://www.onson.co.kr/eng/game/fiesta_global.php The development team created all the content and material. However, they had to seek out a publisher. = Development = It was originally released in Korea in July 2006 through self-publication. It later expanded overseas the following year when Outspark picked it up. Gamigo published the game in Europe. On February 6, 2013, Gamigo acquired the North American licensing rights to Fiesta Online from Outspark. On April 29, 2014, Gamigo announced that Fiesta Online had been greenlit.http://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/forum/board10-news-events/board12-news- announcements/26588-fiesta-eu-on-steam-fiesta-na-coming-soon/ The territory of each zone is tracked via steam and will open the correct page. Players can still download the launcher manually to play the other versions. On March 2, 2016 Gamigo announced it had assumed development rights to the game worldwide. OnsOne Soft LTD and Gamigo declared that the entire development process would switch over to Gamigo completely, an event that occurred by May 17, 2016.http://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/forum/board10-news-events/board12-news- announcements/54581-fiesta-online-a-new-chapter/#post344225  Gameplay  = Skills = The game features three types of skills available to the inhabitants of Isya: Active Skills Active skills are skills that are used during combat or that are used throughout an adventure to turn the tides of battle. They each have their own respective level, class and spirit point requirements. Active skills are the only skills that a player can \\"empower\\" from the skill window. Passive Skills Passive skills are skills that a player can learn and never have to use at all because they are in constant effect as soon as they are learned. They increase certain aspects of each character class available from weapon damage to max sp. Passive skills are not upgradeable. Alchemy Skills Alchemy skills are \\"money-making skills.\\" These skills allow characters to create upgrade stones for weapons and armor, scrolls that give one-hour buffs to the player that consumes them, potions that heal or constantly heal a character's HP/SP over a short period of time as well as increase poison resistance or antidotes, and comp/decomp skills that allow a character to break down or create different materials from a group of a higher tier or lower tier resource with the aid of alchemy stones. Alchemy stones can be purchased from item merchants for money or from other players at a fluctuating price. Alchemy skills are not upgradeable, but require a certain amount of use in order to learn a higher tier of the respective alchemy skill. =Money= In-game currency comes in 4 forms: copper, silver, gold, and gem. One gem is the equivalent of 100 gold; one gold is the equivalent of 1,000 silver; and one silver is the equivalent of 1,000 copper. Players can earn in-game currency through the successful completion of quests and by selling in-game items. As a game with micro-transactions, there is an in-game cash shop which is used by transferring real life currency into a fake currency used exclusively for the item shop. When Outspark owned Fiesta Online, this was called SparkCash. Now under the Gamigo acquisition it is given the name Slime Coins. They have an almost equal exchange rate. The cash shop gives many benefits, from visual only (sex change, name change, beauty coupon) to those with gameplay benefits (tear Of Legel, blessing of Teva, exp boost). The clothing is designed to be a middle man of these two elements. They often have stat increases whilst also giving one's character a more striking outfit; they often only last 30 days. The permanent clothing often do not have stat increases to keep the game fair, but are also usually more expensive. In fairness also, the gameplay benefits tend to be short durations or one time uses (which are sold in packs), any that are longer are much more expensive. =Titles= Titles are little \\"names\\" given to players which they can then apply to the beginning of their name. e.g. \\"popular\\" which is given to players when they have a certain number of people on their friends lists, or \\"monster joke punchline\\" which is given to a player when he or she is killed by the same monster ten times in a row. Some titles now may give benefits to players, such as increased defense or extra skill points added to a skill. =Cards= Fiesta now has collectible cards which can be obtained from killing monsters. These cards can be traded between players and some cards give a \\"Hidden Title\\" which is an incentive to collect all of them. Also, collecting a large number will gives the player bonus and exclusive items, such as Legendary mini-pets. =Guilds= Guilds in Fiesta are a group of players banded together under a name. There are no restrictions to the name of a Guild except the \\"no profanity\\" rule. Currently, any number of guilds can declare war on a given guild, but a given guild can only declare one war itself. There is also a limit to the location of a war between guilds; once a war has begun, all maps become off limits to PVP fights, with the exception of certain towns. To initiate a guild war, interested guilds issue a challenge to other guilds. Guilds are also able to compete with other guild through guild tournaments called \\"Relics of War\\". = Academy = Academies are parts of a guild anyone below level 60 can join. Players start earning rewards of money and items from a guild starting at level 10 and continuing until level 60. At level 60 players graduate from the academy. A player may choose to stay in the academy past level 60. = Player versus player (PVP) = There are free PvP areas in each of the towns: each main town has its own \\"Free Battle Zone\\", with Elderine, Uruga, and Alberstol Ruins having additional Abyss maps, which are PvP zones with additional monsters in them that provide extra experience for the player when killed. Abyss maps are designed to be areas that offer high rewards, but with high risks. Players can enter and spawn kill lower levels, whilst others will enter simply to take advantage of the faster experience gain. Similarly to the levelling issue PvP becomes unfair when someone is using Cash Shop items which has caused an outcry with some players. = In-Game Weddings = One of the biggest features to be released in Fiesta was the in-game wedding system. It was the first feature to be released into the game as one of the most anticipated features for a player to have.http://fiesta.gamigo.com/guide/game-basics/wedding-guide/ Players are required to purchase a wedding application and then buy a ring in-game to propose to their significant other. The acceptance of the proposal results in a global announcement in game as the player and the player's significant other have their names shown at the top of the game's screen for everyone to see. The wedding couple is allowed to invite up to 30 guests, all of which will be teleported to a special wedding chapel for the ceremony. Upon the completion of the ceremony, special rewards, such as buffs and pets, are applied to the wedding couple. = Enhancements = Most weapons and armors may be enhanced with enhancement stones to increase their power. Enhancements can break or degrade items, there are however ways of ensuring this doesn't happen via the cash shop. Annoyingly, at later levels (+5-+10) it becomes very difficult, and most people who enchant past +3 use a large amount of cash shop items due to the cost of the process. = Estate System = The Estate System is also one of Fiesta's biggest and newly anticipated features.http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/loadNews/16255/Estate-System-Adds- Player-Housing Allowing players to do a multi-parted quest which will give them the skill to summon their estate. The estate itself is a little pocket in space, which holds a house that can hold its own furniture, a pool, a walkway and a large area to run around. All of this is aesthetic. Along with the player, the estate can host 15 guests. Furniture has since been added to the game, allowing players to decorate their estate.http://fiesta.gamigo.com/us/forum/board24-gameplay-forum/board25-game- guides/1519-estates-personal-house-guide/ References External links * Fiesta Online Official Website NA Server * Fiesta Online Official Website EU Server * Fiesta Online Official Wiki Category:2007 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Video games developed in South Korea Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Fiesta Online"},{"id":"26711331","text":"Anarchias allardicei is a moray eel commonly known as the Allardice's moray.Common names for Anarchias allardicei at www.fishbase.org.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 30 *Liberal Democrat 20 *Independent 3 Background 19 of the 53 seats on the council were contested in the election.

Web. March 16, 2010. In concept, colleges apply to become members of the ACCJC and volunteer to participate in the accreditation process. The ACCJC has sanctioned colleges at a rate vastly higher than the other accrediting bodies in the United States. At a forum on the CCSF campus California State Senator James Beall and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano described legislation which would undo the monopoly the ACCJC holds on accreditation of California Community Colleges. The accreditation process The accreditation process is premised on the idea that the ACCJC and the colleges together shape the values and best practices of the educational community into the policies, requirements, and standards by which colleges are evaluated. It is the Commission's policy that the ACCJC and its member institutions share this right and responsibility.Accrediting Commission of Community and Junior Colleges. \\"Policy on the Rights and Responsibilities of ACCJC and Member Institutions in the Accrediting Process.\\" Accreditation Reference Handbook. Novato, CA: ACCJC, 2009. 115‚Äì116. Web. March 23, 2010. Accreditation processes vary among regional commissions.

Print. In short, the ACCJC process consists of two elements: the college's evaluation of itself and the ACCJC's evaluation of the college. These evaluations determine the extent to which the college is meeting the ACCJC's policies, requirements, and standards, and their purpose is to help the school improve itself. However, while the ACCJC and its representatives are considered peers of the college they are evaluating, ultimately it is the ACCJC, not the college, that will decide the college's accreditation status and any subsequent steps the college must take to better this status. In 2012 and 2013, the three commissions that were part of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, including the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, formally separated into independent organizations. On August 13, 2013, the ACCJC was found to be in violation of federal regulations concerning its accreditation process. In a letter sent to the president of the ACCJC, the U.S. Department of Education stated that the ACCJC must remedy the problems or risk termination of its federal recognition as an accrediting body. Game Changer for CCSF? Two years later, State Chancellor Brice Harris issued a proposed change to the California Code of Regulations that would remove the ACCJC as the sole accrediting commission for California community colleges. On November 16, 2015, the Board of Governors voted 14-0, with one abstention, to direct Chancellor Harris to create a plan to replace the ACCJC and come up with a timeline by its March, 2016 meeting. Any such transition will take several years to execute, due to the lengthy and rolling nature of accreditation cycles and approval requirements by the U.S. Department of Education. =The self-study= The self-study is an extensive research project by which the college examines itself and makes plans for improvement in the context of the ACCJC's policies, eligibility requirements, and standards. The ACCJC maintains dozens of policies, including \\"Review of Commission Actions.\\"Accrediting Commission of Community and Junior Colleges. Accreditation Reference Handbook.

Web. April 22, 2010. =The self- study report= The college composes and organizes the self-study report, which typically runs several hundred pages or more, along the lines of the ACCJC's policies, requirements, and standards. The bulk of the report is the college's discussion of its adherence to the standards. Here the college must provide a summary of current processes and products, an analysis of the extent to which the college meets the standards, and evidence to support the summary and analysis. When pertinent, the college also adds ‚Äúplanning agendas‚Äù to guide its self-improvement. It then submits this report to the ACCJC in preparation for the ACCJC sending a \\"visiting\\" team to the site to \\"validate\\" the college's account of itself.

When the team is done with its work, it delivers a preliminary oral exit report to the college. Subsequently, the team composes the written team report, which it delivers in draft form both to the ACCJC and to the college. This draft includes the visiting team's commendations and recommendations for addressing deficiencies.

April 22, 2010. =Commission Action= On the basis of the college's self-study report, the site team's visit, the site team's report, documents from previous evaluations, and evidence of student learning and achievement, the nineteen-member Commission determines the accreditation status of the college. It announces this status to the college in an action letter and to the public through ACCJC announcements. This action letter also lists the Commission's \\"official\\" recommendations. For a college seeking reaffirmation, there are in general two possibilities. The ACCJC can reaffirm the college's accreditation, or it can sanction the college. The sanctions are of three kinds: Warning, Probation, and Show Cause. If sanctioned, the college maintains its accreditation, but the ACCJC withholds reaffirmation until the college addresses the matters that led to sanction. The ACCJC will also require the sanctioned college to provide one or more follow-up reports to confirm that it is in fact fulfilling the Commission's recommendations. Often the ACCJC will also require follow-up site visits. Very rarely does the ACCJC terminate a college's accreditation.The Academic Senate for California Community Colleges. \\"Working with the 2002 Accreditation Standards.\\" Sacramento, CA: ASCCC, 2005.

History =16th‚Äì17th centuries= Russian expansion to the Kola Peninsula can be traced to the early 16th century when the Russian monk Trifon founded an Orthodox monastery at Pechenga.A Short History of Finland, pp. 36‚Äì37 Later in 1556, Ivan the Terrible, by his own will, gave the monastery a large part of land on the peninsula. This land covered territories which Norway‚Äîthen a part of the kingdom of Denmark‚ÄìNorway‚Äîtraditionally considered as their own. Consequently, Frederick II, the King of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, sent two expeditions in the 1580s and in 1586 to give up the peninsula. His claims were, however, contested by Sweden, then the major power in the Baltic region. At first, Sweden extracted the Kola Peninsula from both Russia and Denmark‚ÄìNorway in a series of wars and resulting treaties. However, in the later Treaty of T√§ysin√§ in 1595, Sweden acknowledged Russian rights in Kola. Claims from Denmark‚ÄìNorway remained, and therefore in 1582, a Russian voivode was appointed to Kola to provide for better defenses of the peninsula.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 18‚Äì24 The voivode governed the territory which became known as Kolsky Uyezd. Upon its creation, the uyezd covered most of the territory of the Kola Peninsula, with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts (which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), and also the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery. In 1608‚Äì1611, a population census was conducted in the uyezd. The census categorized the Sami people (called \\"Lapps\\" by the census) living in the uyezd into three groups‚ÄîTerskaya Lapps, who lived west of the line between Kildin Island and Turiy Headland of the Turiy Peninsula; Konchanskaya Lapps, who lived east of that line; and Leshya (wild, unbaptized) Lapps, who lived south of Kandalaksha all the way south to approximately the 65th parallel. The territories on which each group lived were also named by the same terms (Terskaya, Konchanskaya, and Leshya). The territory of the Terskaya Lapps included the Sami pogosts of Voroninsky, Norensky (Semiostrovsky), Lovozersky, Ponoysky, and Kandala. The territory of Konchanskaya Lapps comprised the pogosts of Babinsky, Yekostrovsky, Maselgsky, Songelsky, Notozersky, Munomoshsky (Kildinsky), Motovsky, Pechengsky, Pazretsky, and Nyavdemsky. In 1623‚Äì1624, the territory of the Konchanskaya Lapps was occasionally called the \\"Upper Lands\\" (). Apart from the Sami pogosts, the uyezd also included Kandalakshskaya, Knyazhegubskaya, Kovdskaya, Keretskaya, and Poryegubskaya Volosts, as well as northern Karelia. Kolsky ostrog served as the administrative center. =18th century= Kolsky Uyezd (labeled \\"Russian Lapland\\") in the Atlas of Thomas Kitchin, 1773 From the time of its foundation, the uyezd was governed directly from Moscow. This changed on , 1708, when Tsar Peter the Great divided the country into eight governorates, and Kolsky and Dvinsky Uyezds became a part of Archangelgorod Governorate. When Archangelgorod Governorate was abolished by Catherine II on 1780, Kolsky Uyezd became a part of Arkhangelsk Oblast of Vologda Viceroyalty. When Arkhangelsk Oblast was re-organized into Arkhangelsk Viceroyalty by Catherine II's decree on , 1784, Kolsky Uyezd became a part of it as well. The borders of the uyezd were also changed‚ÄîVarzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts were transferred under its jurisdiction, while most territories in northern Karelia were transferred into Kemsky Uyezd. Upon Paul I's accession to the throne in 1796, all viceroyalties in Russia were abolished, and the country was divided into governorates instead. Arkhangelsk Viceroyalty was transformed into Arkhangelsk Governorate, of which Kolsky Uyezd became a part. =19th century= The borders of the uyezd were changed again in 1826. According to the treaty between Russia and the Sweden‚ÄìNorway union, the territory to the west of the Voryema River was ceded to Norway. Russia retained only a small plot of land on the left bank of the Paz River with a 16th-century church of Boris and Gleb, and a pogost, today's Borisoglebsky. 1828 saw more changes‚ÄîKnyazhegubskaya Volost was merged into Kandalakshskaya Volost; Chernoretskoye usolye was merged into Kovdskaya Volost, Tetrinskaya slobodka and Pyalitskaya slobodka, along with Ponoy, were merged into Varzuzhskaya Volost, and Poryegubskaya Volost was merged into Umbskaya Volost. On , 1841, all volosts in the uyezds of Arkhangelsk Governorate were enlarged. In Kolsky Uyezd, only two volosts remained‚ÄîKovdskaya, which included old Keretskaya and Kandalakshskaya Volosts and all of the pogosts; and Kuzomenskaya, which was formed from Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts and the territory of the Terskaya Lapps). After having been reduced nearly to ashes as a result of a bombardment by a British ship in 1854, the town of Kola went into decline. As a result, on , 1858, Tsar Alexander II approved a State Council opinion \\"On Changing the Governance in the Town of Kola and in Kolsky Uyezd\\" that Kolsky Uyezd be abolished and its territory merged into Kemsky Uyezd. The uyezd was restored on , 1883 when Tsar Alexander III approved a new opinion of the State Council, although the territory of the restored uyezd was smaller than its pre-1858 territory. In 1899, it was renamed Alexandrovsky Uyezd. Demographics At the time of the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Kolsky Uyezd had 9,291 inhabitants.–î–µ–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–ø Weekly. –ü–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –≤—Å–µ–æ–±—â–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏ 1897 –≥. –†–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ —Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–º—É —è–∑—ã–∫—É –∏ —É–µ–∑–¥–∞–º 50 –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. –ö–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π —É–µ–∑–¥.

Whitehead link being unknotted by undoing one crossing In the mathematical area of knot theory, the unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself (crossing switch) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number n, then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be changed to unknot by switching n crossings. The unknotting number of a knot is always less than half of its crossing number.. Any composite knot has unknotting number at least two, and therefore every knot with unknotting number one is a prime knot.

Creation It concluded the international conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes, that took place at the Czech Senate and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic from 24 to 26 February 2010. The declaration reiterated many of the suggestions set forth by the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism. =Hosts= The conference was hosted by Ji≈ô√≠ Li≈°ka, Vice President of the Czech Senate, and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, and organized by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes under the patronage of Jan Fischer, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Heidi Hautala, Chairwoman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the European Parliament, G√∂ran Lindblad, Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, among others. The cooperation partners included the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the Information Office of the European Parliament, the Representation of the European Commission in the Czech Republic, the Robert Schuman Foundation of the European People's Party, the Polish Institute in Prague, the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records and the National Endowment for Democracy. Content The declaration both called for condemnation of communism, education about communist crimes, prosecution of communist criminals by establishing an international court within the EU for communist crimes, construction of a memorial to the victims of world communism, and reduction of pensions and social security benefits for communist perpetrators. The declaration stated that: *\\"Communist regimes have committed, and are in some cases still committing, crimes against humanity in all countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in other countries where communism is still alive\\" *\\"Crimes against humanity are not subject to statutory limitations according to international law; however, the justice done to perpetrators of Communist crimes over the past 20 years has been extremely unsatisfactory\\" *\\"We must not deny the tens of millions of victims of Communism their right to justice\\" *\\"Since crimes against humanity committed by the communist regimes do not fall under the jurisdiction of existing international courts, we call for the creation of a new international court with a seat within the EU for the crimes of communism. Communist crimes against humanity must be condemned by this court in a similar way as the Nazi crimes were condemned and sentenced by the Nuremberg tribunal, and as the crimes committed in former Yugoslavia were condemned and sentenced\\" *\\"Not punishing the communist criminals means disregard of and thus weakening of international law\\" *\\"As an act of reparation and restitution, European countries must introduce legislation that equalizes the pensions and social security benefits of perpetrators of communist crimes so that they are equal to or smaller than those of their victims\\" *\\"As democracy must learn to be capable of defending itself, Communism needs to be condemned in a similar way as Nazism was. We are not equating the respective crimes of Nazism and Communism, including the Gulag, the Laogai and the Nazi concentration camps. They should each be studied and judged on their own terrible merits. Communist ideology and communist rule contradict the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Just as we are not willing to relativise crimes of Nazism, we must not accept a relativisation of crimes of Communism.\\" *\\"We call upon EU member states to increase the awareness raising and education about crimes of communism; we remind them of the need to implement, without further delay, the Resolution of the European Parliament (2 April 2009) to mark 23 August as the European-wide Day of Remembrance of the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.\\" *\\"We call upon the European Commission and European Council of Justice and Home Affairs to adopt a Framework Decision introducing a pan-European ban on excusing, denying or trivializing the crimes of communism.\\" *\\"The creation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as supported by the European Parliament and the EU Council in 2009, must be completed at EU level. Individual governments must live up to their commitments regarding the work of the Platform.\\" *\\"As an act of recognition of the victims and respect for the immense suffering inflicted upon half of the continent, Europe must erect a memorial to the victims of world Communism, following the example of the memorial in the USA in Washington, D.C.\\" Signatories The signatories included: *Ji≈ô√≠ Li≈°ka, Vice President of the Czech Senate *Harry Wu, human rights activist *Nikita V.

Both torts have been present from the time of Henry III, being affected by a variety of philosophical shifts through the years which saw them become first looser and then far more stringent and less protecting of an individual's rights. Each tort requires the claimant to prove that the defendant's actions caused interference, which was unreasonable, and in some situations the intention of the defendant may also be taken into account. A significant difference is that private nuisance does not allow a claimant to claim for any personal injury suffered, while public nuisance does. Private nuisance has received a range of criticism, with academics arguing that its concepts are poorly defined and open to judicial manipulation; Conor Gearty has written that \\"Private nuisance has, if anything, become even more confused and confusing. Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works, little changed over the years, its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort. Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone\\". In addition, it has been claimed that the tort of private nuisance has \\"lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault-based tort of negligence\\", and that private and public nuisance \\"have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name\\". History Adam Smith; A.V. Dicey argued that his work led to a laissez faire attitude to industrial pollution and damages during the 19th century. The tort of nuisance has existed since the reign of Henry III, with few changes, and most of them merely technical.Brenner (1974) p. 403 It originally came from the Latin nocumentum, and then the French nuisance, with Henry de Bracton initially defining the tort of nuisance as an infringement of easements.Winfield (1931) p. 189 The tort was in line with the economic status quo of the time, protecting claimants against their neighbours' rights to develop land, and thus has been described as \\"rural, agricultural, and conservative\\".Brenner (1974) p. 404 There were initially four remedies for nuisance; the assize of nuisance, similar to the assize of novel disseisin, which was limited to situations where the defendant's actions interfered with the claimant's seisin;Winfield (1931) p. 190 the action guod permittat prosternere, where the land in question was alienated; the writ of trespass; and the \\"action upon the case for nuisance\\", which became the main remedy.Winfield (1931) p. 191 This was because it was far faster than the other writs and actions, and unlike them did not require that both parties be freeholders. It was, however, limited to damages, and unlike the other remedies did not allow for abatement.Winfield (1931) p. 192 By the 17th century the judicial philosophy had changed to allow the protection of a claimant's enjoyment of their land, with the duty being on the party that caused the nuisance to prevent it: \\"as every man is bound to look to his cattle, as to keep them out of his neighbour's ground; so he must keep in the filth of his house of office, that it may not flow in upon and damnify his neighbour\\".Brenner (1974) p. 406 During the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution, the law of nuisance significantly changed; rather than the previous tests a standard of care was instead expected, with different standards applying to individuals and companies.Brenner (1974) p. 408 In reaching these decisions the courts \\"effectively emasculated the Law of Nuisance as a useful curb on industrial pollution\\".McLaren (1983) p. 157 In St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping,[1865] 11 HL Cas 642 for example, several judges \\"were explicit in suggesting that they were affected by the adverse effect of a more draconian view on the economic welfare of the country's industrial cities\\".McLaren (1983) p. 158 This contrasted with the previous view, which was that when liability was established for a case where the defendant's actions had interfered with the enjoyment of land, the defendant would be liable however trivial the interference.McLaren (1983) p. 169 The decisions reached during this period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks to the influence of philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: > Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical > economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy > in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, > since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social > novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, > the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many > working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus > of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very > narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. > In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of > voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for > inaction.McLaren (1983) p. 192 19th-century legislation included: * Nuisances Removal Act 1860 (23 & 24 Vict.) * Nuisances Removal Act for England (Amendment) Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict.) * Smoke Nuisance (Scotland) Act 1865 (28 & 29 Vict.) * Nuisances Removal (No. 1) Act 1866 (29 & 30 Vict.) . The legislation recognised that diseased meat could cause sickness and needed to be removed from sale. In 1864 William Johnstone, a \\"wholesale pork pie manufacturer and sausage roll maker\\", was fined ¬£15 (2015: ¬£), under the 1863 Act, for having on his premises a large quantity of meat unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food.The Times Police.. 27 October 1864; p. 9 Private nuisance Private nuisance was defined in Bamford v Turnley,[1860] 3 B&S; 62 where George Wilshere, 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as \\"any continuous activity or state of affairs causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [claimant's] land or his use or enjoyment of that land\\".Bermingham (2008) p. 225 Private nuisance, unlike public nuisance, is only a tort, and damages for personal injuries are not recoverable.Bermingham (2008) p. 224 Only those who have a legal interest in the affected land can sue; an exception was made in Khorasandjian v Bush,[1993] QB 727 where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no legal interest in the property.Bermingham (2008) p. 235 In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd,[1997] AC 655 however, the House of Lords rejected this development, arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person. The liable party under private nuisance is the creator, even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else's land. In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan,[1940] AC 880 it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance (a set of water pipes) even though he had not created it, because he had used the pipes and thereby \\"adopted\\" the nuisance.Bermingham (2008) p. 236 There is a general rule that a landlord who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty,[1986] 1 All ER 663 or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen.[1940] 1 KB 229Bermingham (2008) p. 237 The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it.Elliott (2007) p. 269 Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable for the actions of their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank,[1936] 2 All ER 633 it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.Elliott (2007) p. 268 For there to be a claim in private nuisance, the claimant must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping,[1865] 11 HLC 642 or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc;[1994] 1 All ER 53 if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test is whether or not the nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.Elliott (2007) p. 267 =Interference= One Canada Square, the subject of Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd. The claimant must first show that the defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation,[1958] 1 QB 60 noise, as in Christie v Davey,[1893] 1 Ch D 316 or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders.[1995] 2 All ER 697 The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki,[1956] 1 All ER 652 but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or \\"things of delight\\"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by the construction of the skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support.Elliott (2007) p. 262 An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust,[1980] QB 485 which established that in such situations \\"the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances\\". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council,[2000] QB 836 where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.Elliott (2007) p. 263 =Unreasonableness= While there is no set definition of what is or is not unreasonable, factors that are taken into account include any \\"abnormal sensitivity\\" of the claimant, the nature of the locality where the nuisance took place, the time and duration of the interference and the conduct of the defendant.Bermingham (2008) p. 226 \\"Abnormal sensitivity\\" is where the claimant's damaged property is particularly sensitive to damage by the defendant's actions. In Robinson v Kilvert,[1889] LR 41 ChD 88 it was established that if the action of the defendant would not have caused damage were it not for this abnormal sensitivity, the defendant is not liable. However, if the damage was caused to abnormally sensitive property but would also have damaged non-sensitive property, the defendant is liable, as in McKinnon Industries v Walker.[1951] 3 DLR 577Bermingham (2008) p. 227 This was because it infringed on the \\"right to ordinary enjoyment\\"; as a result, the claimant could claim for his more sensitive activities as well.Elliott (2007) p. 265 The locality where the interference occurred also influences whether or not it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman,[1879] LR 11 Ch D 852 Thesiger LJ wrote that \\"what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [a residential area] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [a smelly industrial area]\\". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd,[1993] QB 343 it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created.Bermingham (2008) p. 228 The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be \\"a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail\\".Bermingham (2008) p. 229 In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness. The time and duration of the activity is also taken into account when determining unreasonableness. Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum,[1961] 2 All ER 145 filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable, but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A private nuisance is normally a \\"continuing state of affairs\\", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer,[1914] 30 TLR 257 where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting the time of the activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd,[1969] 2 All ER 1252 where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs, and the defendants were liable.Bermingham (2008) p. 230 =Conduct of the defendant= In some circumstances, the conduct of the defendant can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This is one of the few exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.Bermingham (2008) p. 231 =Issues with private nuisance= The idea of private nuisance has been criticised by academics for at least 50 years. Criticism centres on the free rein given to the judiciary and the lack of concrete definitions for legal principles; the idea of \\"reasonableness\\", for examples, is frequently bandied about, but \\"rarely examined in detail, and it would be a brave person who would attempt to draw out a definition\\".Lee (2003) p. 298 While a definition for private nuisance is easy to find, the regularly accepted one does not consider that most private nuisance cases involve two occupiers of land; the \\"nuisance\\" has moved from the defendant's land to the claimant's land. Some judicial rationes decidendi, such as that of Lord Wright in Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, seem to indicate that private nuisance is only valid in situations where there are two occupiers of land. Despite this, definitions of private nuisance fail to include any reference.Cross (1995) p. 446 Academics also assert that the tort of private nuisance has \\"lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault-based tort of negligence\\".Cross (1995) p. 445 Conor Gearty supports the assertion that private nuisance is confused, and also claims that private nuisance is significantly different from public nuisance; \\"they have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name... Private nuisance has, if anything, become even more confused and confusing. Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works, little changed over the years, its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort. Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone\\".Gearty (1989) Public nuisance Public nuisance concerns protecting the public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such it is not only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd,[1957] 2 QB 169 it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission \\"which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects\\".Bermingham (2008) p. 241 Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM,[1986] Ch 20 blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles,4 Maul & Sel 101 or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver.[1914] 1 Ch 631Elliott (2007) p. 279 A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered \\"special damage\\" over and above the effects on the other affected people in the \\"class\\". The test for the required size of a \\"class\\" was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was \\"so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large\\".Elliott (2007) p. 280 Because public nuisance is primarily a criminal matter, and affects a \\"class\\" of people rather than an individual, claims are normally brought by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a \\"relator\\", representing the affected people. Other members of the affected class are allowed to sue individually, but only if they have suffered \\"special damage\\".Bermingham (2008) p. 242 The potential defendants in public nuisance claims are the same as those in private nuisance, with their liability dependent on a test of reasonableness; in public nuisance, however, this is determined by looking solely at the interference, not the defendant's actions.Bermingham (2008) p. 243 Defences There are several defences to nuisance claims; in Nichols v Marsland,[1876] 2 Ex D 1 for example, \\"Act of God\\" was accepted as a defence. One defence is that of \\"20 years prescription\\", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show that it has been continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a \\"confectionery business\\". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started.Bermingham (2008) p. 238 A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd,[1981] AC 1001 the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying \\"Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty\\".Elliott (2007) p. 273 The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.Moor (2011) Remedies There are three possible remedies where a defendant is found to have committed a nuisance; injunctions, damages and abatement. Injunctions are the main remedy, and consist of an order to stop the activity causing the nuisance. They may be \\"perpetual\\", completely forbidding the activity, or \\"partial\\", for example limiting when the activity can take place.Elliott (2007) p. 275 Damages are a monetary sum paid by the defendant for the claimant's loss of enjoyment or any physical damage suffered; they may be paid for things as varied as loss of sleep or any loss of comfort caused by noise or smells. Abatement is a remedy that allows the claimant to directly end the nuisance, such as trimming back a protruding hedge. If the abatement requires the claimant stepping onto the defendant's land, he must give notice or risk becoming a trespasser.Elliott (2007) p. 276 References Bibliography    Category:English tort law ","title":"Nuisance in English law"},{"id":"26711549","title":"List of states and union territories of India by transport network"},{"id":"26711576","text":"Advertisement (1917) Marie Cahill (December 29, 18661870, 1880 and 1900 Federal Census.

Between 1898 and 1905, more than fifty pairs of Zwillinge twin tank steam locomotives with a 0-6-0 wheel arrangement were delivered to the Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn (Swakopmund- Windhoek State Railway) in German South West Africa. By 1922, only two known specimens of these locomotives remained to be taken onto the roster of the South African Railways.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South West Africa. South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, August 1947. pp. 667-668. Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn The first troops of the German Feldbahn-Baukommando (field railway construction commando) arrived in Swakopmund in German South West Africa (GSWA) on 11 September 1897. They were tasked to build a narrow gauge railway across the Namib Desert from Swakopmund to Windhoek, via Jakkalswater and Karibib. The Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn, later named the Northern State Railway or Nordbahn, was officially opened to traffic nearly five years later, on 1 July 1902. The railway was initially intended for temporary military purposes only, to be worked by means of animal power such as Argentine mules or Cape donkeys, but steam traction was soon adopted. The track was laid on steel sleepers with rail and had very severe curves and gradients. Climbing out of the Khan River gorge, the gradient was 1 in 19 (5¬º%) with curves of . In 1905, a branch line was constructed from Karibib on the Nordbahn to Onguati near Usakos, where it connected with the new Otavi line from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. This created an alternative line from Windhoek to the Atlantic Ocean at times when the section through the Khan River gorge suffered from the occasional flooding. The Nordbahn section between Swakopmund and Karibib was later abandoned and, between 1911 and 1913, the section between Karibib and Windhoek was regauged to Cape gauge. Manufacturers Zwillinge locomotives, the first engines to enter service on the Nordbahn, were a class of small narrow gauge paired tank steam locomotives. They were built in Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century for military railways in Germany and the German Empire. The first large consignment of Zwillinge locomotives arrived in Swakopmund between 1898 and 1899. Eventually, by 1905, more than fifty new or used pairs had been delivered to the Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn. They were built by six manufacturers, Krauss and Company, Henschel and Son, L. Schwartzkopff, Egestorf, Machinenbau Anstalt and Arnold Jung. These so-called Feldbahn locomotives, built for the military, were also used in other German colonies and several came to GSWA second-hand. The final batch of four pairs of Zwillinge for the Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn were built by Krauss in 1903 with works numbers 4875 to 4878 and engine numbers 179 to 182 A and B.Schmeiser, Bernard (1977). Krauss-Lokomotiven. Verlag Josef Otto Slezak, Wien. . Characteristics As indicated by their name Zwillinge (twins), they were actually two separate locomotives which were designed to be semi- permanently coupled back-to-back at the cabs, allowing a single footplate crew to fire and control both engines. The pairs of locomotives shared a common manufacturer's works number and engine number, with the separate units being designated as A and B. The A locomotives had higher cabin roofs than the B locomotives so that the roofs could overlap while they were coupled to provide better protection for the crew. They were designed so that they could also be used separately and each had a complete set of controls. When they were run in single mode, they were commonly referred to as Illinge.Klaus Dierks. Namibias Schmalspureisenbahnen erschlie√üen Afrikas letzte Wildnis - Namibias Schienenverkehr zwischen Aufbau und R√ºckgang. The principle of using two tank locomotives which are semi-perma¬≠nently coupled at their cab ends was patented in 1855 by the English loco¬≠motive builders Robert Stephenson and Company.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1943). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Adoption of the 3 ft. 6 in. Gauge on the Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, August 1943. pp. 592-594. The Zwillinge could negotiate curves of and could haul loads of up a 1 in 25 (4%) gradient. They had balloon-type spark arresters in their chimneys and were coal-fired, the coal being imported from Germany. The steam regulator was arranged outside the high steam dome and, on some, two sandboxes were arranged on top of the boiler, fore and aft of the dome, while others had two small cylindrical sandboxes attached to the smokebox. They had flat Murdoch's D slide valves which were actuated by Stephenson valve gear, arranged outside the plate frames. By the outbreak of the First World War, a total of 182 Zwillinge pairs had been produced for employment in several German territories. Production of new Zwillinge was terminated a few years after the adoption of the larger Brigadelok as the new standard German military locomotive in 1901. At least twelve of these new Brigadeloks were also delivered to the Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn between 1901 and 1904, built by Krauss and numbered in the range from 101 to 112.The Heeresfeldbahn pages: Zwilling Service Zwillinge near Pforte in 1898 Shortly after the first Zwillinge locomotives were placed in service, it was found that the tank engine's fuel and water capacities were insufficient for the distances which had to be covered in the German colonies in Africa, especially in the harsh conditions presented by the Namib Desert which had to be crossed between Swakopmund and Windhoek. To solve this, a four-axle water tender was attached to the twin engines. It served the dual purpose of also providing seating for armed escorts. The bench atop the water tender as well as the water pipe between the locomotives and tender is visible in the picture alongside. When the German government began to regauge the line between Windhoek and Swakopmund, most of the Zwillinge were withdrawn from GSWA. Most of them were sold to Japan and a few were purchased by the Otavi Railway for use as construction engines. No. 169B arriving at Bellville Quarry In 1922, the South African Railways (SAR) took control of all railway operations in South West Africa (SWA), but the SWA locomotives were never reclassified or renumbered and retained their former German identities until they were withdrawn from service. Illinge numbers 154A and 169B were the only known survivors of the Zwillinge fleet to be taken onto the SAR roster. No. 154A was employed in Windhoek as a non-revenue departmental locomotive and was finally withdrawn from service in 1939, after logging a total mileage of about . No. 169B, built in 1904 by Maschinenbau-Anstalt Humboldt, was shipped to Cape Town after the First World War and placed in non-revenue service at the Bellville quarry into the side of the Tygerberg. Preservation The sole surviving Illinge locomotive, no. 154A, is now plinthed under a shelter outside Windhoek Station. This particular locomotive was half of a pair which was built by Henschel in 1900, works no. 5376. The engine arrived in GSWA second-hand in 1904, being shown in the Henschel works lists as originally built new for the Deutsche Feldbahnen in 1900 as one half of seven locomotive pairs with engine numbers 148A&B; to 154A&B; and works numbers 5364 to 5377. It is not known where it was first placed in service.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow It was originally plinthed at the Railway College at Esselen Park in Kaalfontein, near Kempton Park in Transvaal. During the late 1950s, it was returned to SWA and plinthed in its present location in front of the station building in Windhoek. Commemoration A postage stamp depicting the Zwillinge was one of a set of four SWA commemorative stamps which was issued on 2 August 1985 to commemorate the narrow gauge locomotives which pioneered railways in the territory. The stamp design was by the noted stamp designer and artist Koos van Ellinckhuijzen.Philatelic Bulletin 44, issued by Philatelic Services and INTERSAPA, 1985De Jager, Okkie and Steenkamp, Riaan - The Art of J.J. (Koos) van Ellinckhuijzen The particular locomotives depicted were the second GSWA pair, numbered 2A and 2B. The name of the station on the name board on the stamp, written in Fraktur script, is Otjimukoka. In 1903, this station was renamed to Johann Albrechtsh√∂he in honour of Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg, and again changed later to the shortened Albrechts. A head-on outline of an Illinge was used by the SWA postal authorities as a commemorative cancellation for Swakopmund on the date of issue. The stamp, the postmark and another painting of the Zwillinge appeared on the first day cover which marked the release of the four stamps.The Art of Koos van Ellinckhuijzen: Historical Namibian Railways, on North-West University South Africa website Other locomotive types Other locomotive types also served on the Nordbahn, but information about them is sketchy. Apart from the twelve Brigadeloks, the first of another type of small twin locomotives known as Pugs by the enginemen and probably employed on shunting duties, were delivered in 1901 from Machinenbau Anstalt of Breslau, with boilers supplied by Krauss and Company.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, October 1947. p. 859. The Pug twins shared a water tank which was arranged between their engine frames and had chimneys with balloon-type spark arresters. The wheel arrangement of the individual engines is not known, but the boiler pressure was set at , the total heating surface of the boiler was , the firegrate area was and the tractive effort at 50% of boiler pressure was .

The School moved from Kenyon College in 1951 following the withdrawal of funding of the School of English by the Rockefeller Foundation. I.U. President Herman B. Wells obtained funding from the University and located the School under the administration of Dean John W. Ashton of the College of Arts and Sciences. The School opened under the direction of Prof. Richard B. Hudson and then transitioned to Prof. Newton P. 'Stalky' Stallknecht until his retirement and the School's dissolution in 1972. Founding of the School of Letters When Indiana University moved the School from Kenyon to Bloomington they maintained John Crowe Ransom, Lionel Trilling, Philip Rahv, Austin Warren, and Allen Tate as senior fellows, all well-known literary scholars. The Kenyon School of English was founded by three senior fellows, John Crowe Ransom, F. O. Matthiessen and Lionel Trilling and was held during a summer session at Kenyon College from 1948 until 1950. The first session of the School of Letters in Bloomington ran from June 21 to August 1, 1951.Arden Fitz, ‚ÄúSchool of Letters Opens at I.

Eight) was an Israeli military operation conducted against the Egyptian-held police fort of Iraq Suwaydan in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The battle was fought between the Israel Defense Forces and the Egyptian Army on November 9, 1948, and ended in an Israeli victory, following numerous previous Israeli attempts to capture the fort, two of them in Operation Yoav just weeks before. The Israeli 8th and Givati brigades attacked the fort in broad daylight following a heavy artillery barrage. After a hole was blown through the wall of the fort, the Egyptian forces surrendered. The capture of the fort led to the Egyptian evacuation of Bayt 'Affa and other nearby positions, reducing the besieged Fallujah Pocket to the villages of Fallujah and Iraq al-Manshiyya. Background The Iraq Suwaydan police fort was built along with the other British Tegart forts in the wake of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. It occupied a strategic location overlooking the Majdal‚ÄìHebron road and the junction with the internal Negev road. When the British withdrew from the area in May 1948, the fort was handed over to Muslim Brotherhood forces. It was a major obstacle to Israeli transportation to the Negev enclave and served as a forward base against Israeli positions in the area, including kibbutz Negba. The Israelis nicknamed the fort \\"The Monster on the Hill\\". Attempts to capture the fort Eight attempts were made to capture the Iraq Suwaydan police fort. After 7 failed attempts (5 by the Givati brigade, and 2 by the Negev Brigade), the demolitions team of the 89th battalion successfully broke into the police fort. This led to the surrender of the Egyptian force manning the fort.http://yadlashiryon.com/ =First attempt= In the framework of the Hagana's Plan Dalet, which was prepared toward the end of the British Mandate, the Givati Brigade was tasked with capturing the Tegart forts located in its area of operations, immediately upon the British departure. On April 17, 1948, the Givati 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yitzhak Pundak, took control of the Qatra police station near Gedera using intimidation only. Pundak wished to use the same methods to capture the Iraq Suwaydan police fort, but encountered opposition from the military commander of Kibbutz Negba, Yitzhak Dubno, who was supported by Givati brigade commander Shimon Avidan. On the 12th of May, Dubno sent a report by telegram to the commander of the 53rd Battalion that: The following day, the commander of the 53rd Battalion received information from Hagana intelligence that the Egyptian army had left the fort, which was now in the hands of local villagers, and that during the day it was manned by a symbolic force of six sentries.Avraham Eilon, Hativat Giva'ti be-Milhemet ha-Komemiut [Givati Brigade in the War of Independence] (Tel Aviv, 1959) On May 13, during Operation Barak, after the capture of the villages of Burayr and Hulayqat by the Second Battalion of the Negev Brigade, battalion commander Moshe Netzer suggested taking advantage of the opportunity to continue northward with his battalion and attack the fortress of Iraq Suwaydan. Oded Messer, the operations officer of the Negev Brigade, did not give his approval to the operation. Thus, this opportunity to capture the fortress with relative ease may have been missed. While most of the battalions of the Givati Brigade were ordered to move to the Latrun area in order to participate in Operation Maccabi, the 53rd remained in the south to regroup after the night battle at Bayt Daras. In light of the situation of the brigade and the battalion, and in light of the erroneous information received from Haganah intelligence, the battalion commander sent one armored platoon to seize the police building during daylight on May 14. This weak attack was stopped without difficulty by the powerful Egyptian force occupying the fortress. =Second attempt= On the night between 18 and 19 May, the Givati 53rd and 54th battalions made a second attempt to conquer the fortress. The attack, which took place from the north, failed due to faulty planning: out of the attacking company, only one platoon was assigned for breaching, while the rest were given the task of closing and securing the access routes. A company from the 54th Battalion secured the outer perimeter. Paralyzing fire from the mortars and machine guns did not succeed in suppressing the fire of the defending forces. When the attacking troops approached the fort, they set off powerful illumination mines, losing the element of surprise. It was therefore decided to order a withdrawal. =Third attempt= On the night of May 21‚Äì22, a third attempt was made to capture the fortress. Three breaching forces were established, but they were not concentrated into a unified effort. At dawn, the order was given to withdraw, after it became clear that the attacking forces had received casualties: 40 wounded and 3 dead. =Fourth attempt= On the night of 10‚Äì11 June, just a few hours before the first truce of the war came into effect, a fourth attempt was made to conquer the police fort by the Negev Brigade. This time the attack came from the south. The breaching force advanced while supporting forces laid down suppressive fire against the defenders. The advancing force was spotted by the defenders as soon as it breached the first fence, and had to continue the assault under heavy fire. In the course of the battle, the attackers breached the first four fences, and a small team with breaching explosives slipped past the fifth fence. However, the sun was about to rise and the operation commanders, unaware of the extent of the progress made, gave the order to retreat. In addition, the demolitions soldiers accompanying the troops had been taken out of action by enemy fire. The forces withdrew from the field without detonating the explosives. In total, the Israeli casualties were 4 dead and 12 wounded, including two men killed by fire from enemy aircraft that had come to assist the defenders.http://www.2all.co.il/web/Sites15/zofimvi/PAGE19.asp During their retreat, the Israeli soldiers noticed a number of Egyptian soldiers fleeing the field as well, but continued their own withdrawal. After the battle was over, the forces discovered that a transmission had been intercepted by Negev Brigade SIGINT forces in the course of the fighting. The commander defending the fort had reported to the Egyptian headquarters in Majdal that the Israeli attack had been too strong for him to withstand, and that his forces had begun a retreat from the fort. Technical problems with the communications equipment prevented this information from reaching the commanders and soldiers in the field. If the report had been received, it is likely that the fort could have been captured during this attack.http://www.irgon- haagana.co.il/info/hi_show.aspx?id=21793 =Fifth attempt= On the night of 8‚Äì9 July, on the eve of the end of the first truce, the IDF made preparations for Operation An-Far (short for Anti-Farouk), a two-brigade operation aimed at breaking into the besieged Negev region. The Negev Battalion was once again given the mission to capture the police fort. While the Givati Brigade attacked from the north and captured the villages of Bayt 'Affa and Iraq Suwaydan, a reinforced company of the Negev Brigade attacked the Iraq Suwaydan police fort from the south. The attack began after a long delay. The Negev Brigade force broke through four barbed wire fences, and then discovered an additional fifth fence surrounding the fort, which had been unknown to the attackers' intelligence. Dawn began to break before the fifth fence could be breached. A decision was taken to retreat, to avoid confronting the defending forces in daylight. =Sixth attempt= On the night of 19‚Äì20 October, three days after the beginning of Operation Yoav, the Givati Brigade made another attempt to take the police fort. The attacking force succeeded in breaching two barbed-wire fences, but during their attempt to break through the third fence they encountered heavy fire and were forced to retreat. The commander of the 51st Battalion, Jehuda L. Wallach, wrote about the reason for the failure: =Aerial assault= Two aircraft departed on a bombing sortie in the late afternoon of October 20. The first plane, which was flown by Leonard Fitchett, managed to land its bombs on the police compound, while the second plane did not succeed in releasing its bombs. The two planes were hit by powerful anti- aircraft fire from the fort. Fitchett's plane was hit and forced to land in an area controlled by the Egyptian forces. The body of Leonard Fitchett was found after the crash, but the remains of the other two crew members were never found.◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊ï◊ê◊ú◊ö, ◊ê◊™◊®◊ô ◊ß◊®◊ë◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊®◊ò◊ê, ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù, 2003, ◊¢◊û' 211http://www.iaf.org.il/182-16764-he/IAF.aspx?indx=2 =Seventh attempt= The 7th attack was planned after careful study of intelligence, including the interrogation of prisoners and deciphered enemy documents. Two days after the failure of the sixth attempt, on the night between 21 and 22 October, Givati's 51st Battalion tried to break into the police fort, using flamethrowers installed on armored vehicles. The intruding force managed to penetrate two of the five barbed-wire fences and approached within 50 meters from the south side of the fort, but its progress was halted by strong fire from a bunker that was positioned outside the fort. The commanding officer of the breaching force assigned a squadron under the command of PFC Ben-Zion Leitner to storm the bunker. The squadron remained paralyzed by the intense and unceasing enemy fire. Only Leitner stood up and stormed the source of the fire. Using grenades, he managed to stop the fire from the bunker, though he was critically wounded during the attack. Leitner received the nation's highest military decoration, the Hero of Israel citation (now the Medal of Valor), for this display of heroism. The operation suffered from lack of coordination between the forces. The attack by C company was stopped without breaching the barbed wire. Meanwhile, an armored vehicle heavily laden with explosives (driven by volunteer Yosef 'Adawi) managed to reach a distance of 30 meters from the fortress. At this point, an anti-tank missile fired from the direction of the nearby villages (Iraq Suwaydan and Bayt 'Affa) hit the vehicle and caused the explosives to detonate. While the explosion was premature, it breached the barbed-wire fences and allowed the attacking force to reach the west side of the fort. Though the attacking forces had made new progress against the fort defences, dawn was already breaking. The decision was made to retreat, rather than to take advantage of the situation and continue the attack. In this battle, the Givati 51st Battalion suffered casualties of 5 dead and 26 wounded. Eighth and final attempt (\\"Operation Shmone\\") Yitzhak Sadeh On October 22, at the end of Operation Yoav, IDF forces succeeded in taking control of large areas of the Negev and breaking through to Beersheba. The capture of the Huleiqat and Bayt Jibrin outposts left the Egyptian 4th Brigade, under the command of Sudanese general Said Taha Bey, besieged in an enclave that was given the name of the \\"Faluja pocket\\".◊ó◊†◊ô ◊ñ◊ô◊ï, ◊ô◊ï◊ê◊ë ◊í◊ú◊ë◊®, ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊ß◊©◊™, ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü, 1998, ◊¢◊û' 182.◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊ï◊ê◊ú◊ö, ◊ê◊™◊®◊ô ◊ß◊®◊ë◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊®◊ò◊ê, ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù, 2003, ◊¢◊û' 226. This enclave contained the villages Al-Faluja, Iraq al-Manshiyya, and the area of Iraq Suwaydan. Despite the failed attacks on the Iraq Suwaydan police fort, the Israelis managed to surround the Egyptian 4th Brigade in the area around Fallujah (referred to as the Fallujah Pocket), preventing outside reinforcement and resupply. This paved the way for Operation Shmone (literally, Eight), so named because it would be the 8th Israeli attack on the location. The operation was proposed by the 8th Brigade commander, Yitzhak Sadeh, and carried out by elements of the 8th Brigade. Sadeh conducted extensive research on the possibility of an attack, and concluded that the fort's defense was perfect and neither a surprise attack nor ingenious maneuvering would win the battle. He proposed to hold the attack during the day and use overwhelming firepower. The plan for the artillery attack was presented by the junior officer Dan Kessler. Three waves of attackers were made ready: two for the assault and one as operational reserve. Diversionary attacks would also take place in Iraq al- Manshiyya and the Iraq Suwaydan village. =Planning the operation= Analysis of the previous attempts to capture the fort led Yitzhak Sadeh to the conclusion that all seven previous attempts failed because the attacking forces did not initially try to paralyze enemy fire and destroy its sources, evidently due to the lack of the necessary means to do so in the Givati and Negev brigades. Yitzhak Sadeh, Shaul Yaffe, the deputy brigade commander, and Oded Messer, one of the senior officers in the brigade, wanted to attack the police building with tanks and half-track vehicles, but most of the access roads were exposed to anti-tank fire. After analyzing the terrain, Sadeh and his staff officers were able to find an access route to the fort from the northwest direction. A major advantage of this route was that it was not visible at all to the villages of Iraq Suwaydan and Bayt 'Affa, where the anti-tank guns were placed: the fort itself screened the access route from the villages. In addition, Sadeh decided that the armored attack on the fortress would begin from the northwest toward sunset, when the setting sun would blind the Egyptian defenders in the fortress and make it difficult for them to stop the attack. According to Sadeh's original plan, the attack would begin with an artillery bombardment by the 88th Battalion on the fort and the villages of Iraq Suwaydan and Beit 'Affa. Diversionary attacks on the neighboring villages would prevent reinforcement of the Egyptian forces in the fortress. At a later time that afternoon, Company A of the 89th Battalion, accompanied by tanks from the 82nd Battalion under the command of Dov Tsesis, would move toward the target. The commando and armored units would move in two waves from the northwest, under the cover of the setting sun, and breach the police fort. If the attack failed, the brigade's operational reserve force would join the battle.◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊ï◊ê◊ú◊ö, ...◊ú◊ê ◊¢◊ú ◊û◊í◊© ◊î◊õ◊°◊£, ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊õ◊®◊ò◊ê, ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù, 2000, ◊¢◊û' 61. =Battle= Israeli bombardment of the Iraq Suwaydan police fort The operation started at 14:00 on November 9, 1948, with an artillery barrage from a number of units: two batteries of 75 mm Saint Chamond-Mondrag√≥n (\\"Cucaracha\\"), two batteries of 75 mm Krupp cannons, a number of 6 pounders and sixteen 120 mm mortars with delayed fuses. The cannons fired directly, in order to force the Egyptians to abandon their defensive posts and go inside the building. Machine gunners from Givati's 51st Battalion also positioned themselves to the west of the fort to provide cover fire. The Israelis selected southwest as the direction of the main attack, in order to avoid the Egyptian-held village Bayt 'Affa, which was defended by 2‚Äì3 companies and a number of 6 pounders that could be used to fire at the Israelis. This also made sure that the setting sun would work against the Egyptian side, which would be blinded. The attacking force consisted of 8th Brigade forces: two tanks, two half-tracks armed with 6 pounders and two half-tracks armed with flamethrowers. The assault started at 15:45 under the command of Abraham \\"Kiki\\" Elkin (who later was promoted to Lt. Colonel), and all the while the fort was subjected to artillery fire. At 15:47, the Egyptian flag on the southeastern tower was knocked down by a shell, which significantly raised the Israeli morale. Yitzhak Sadeh wrote: \\"The flag is a symbol. I guess our \\"dry\\" people hold symbols in high regard. When the flag fell, to them it looked like the victory was in the box.\\" At 16:00 the Israeli forces breached the outlying fences without encountering resistance. Egyptian prisoners taken at Iraq Suwaydan under bombardment Around 15:50, the armored forces began to move toward the fort. Tanks from Battalion 82, accompanied by soldiers and a demolitions team from Battalion 89 armed with Bangalore torpedoes, broke through the barbed-wire fences and reached the compound's walls. The demolitions team from Company A of the 89th Battalion, blew a gap in the western wall of the fort. The Egyptian force manning the fort surrendered as soon as the wall was breached. There were few Israeli casualties. Other than the prisoners of war, the Israelis captured four medium machine guns, two 3\\" mortars and a number of PIATs. Following the surrender of the fort, the Egyptians decided to evacuate nearby positions, including Bayt 'Affa, the village Iraq Suwaydan and the positions west of Fallujah. The Israelis immediately capitalized on this, taking hills 112.4, 112.6, 120.4 and 128.6 on November 9, and the seven hills west of Fallujah on November 10, which they had failed to take by force just a week earlier. Meanwhile, Israeli mechanized forces were met with stiff resistance in the village of Iraq Suwaydan, and two armored vehicles were hit by Egyptian artillery. The driver of the first vehicle, Private Siman-Tov Gana, was severely injured but provided cover fire for the rest of the force as it retreated, and was awarded the Hero of Israel citation for his efforts. Six Israelis were killed and 14 were wounded in the battle. Aftermath The Givati Museum in the Yoav Fortress in 2008 The capture of the Iraq Suwaydan police fort led to the withdrawal of the Egyptian army from the villages of Iraq Suweidan and Bayt 'Affa, reducing the \\"Falluja pocket\\" to the villages of Faluja and Iraq al-Manshiyyah only. The capture of the area by the 8th Brigade reduced the ongoing threat to nearby Jewish settlements, particularly Kibbutz Negba, which had suffered from artillery shelling over a long period of time. The victorious Israeli forces returned for a victory celebration held in Negba a week later. Negba, which had been attacked twice by Egyptian forces, was presented the Egyptian flag from the fort by Yitzhak Sadeh. The Givati Brigade culture officer, Abba Kovner, renamed the structure to Fort Yoav (), after Yitzhak \\"Yoav\\" Dubno, who was killed in action in Negba on May 21, 1948. The fort became an Israeli military base and the Givati Museum was opened there in the 1980s. Notes Bibliography  * Further reading * Sadeh, Yitzhak (1950). How the Fortress was Captured.

Firm history Edelson PC was founded in 2007 in Chicago, Illinois and opened an office in San Francisco, California in 2015. Practice areas Privacy Following Edelson PC's work in Spokeo v. Robbins, its internal lab of computer forensic engineers and lawyers were commended for their ability to handle big cases that have a lasting legacy. Edelson has successfully litigated against Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google for violating consumer privacy laws by improperly storing users' search, contact, and biometric data. The firm's legal strategy has been called scrappy, creative, and borderline genius. The US District Court of Northern District of California has identified Edelson PC as a pioneer in the electronic privacy class action field by litigating some of the largest consumer class actions in the US on this issue. Consumer Fraud Edelson PC has successfully prosecuted more than 200 large-scale class and mass actions on behalf of victims of consumer fraud or unfair business practices, including the Thomas the Tank Engine lead paint class action, the AT&T; mobile content class action, the home equity credit reduction cases, and privacy class actions involving T-Mobile, Facebook, and Netflix. Mass Tort Cases Edelson PC is co-lead counsel in the NCAA personal injury concussion litigation, where it is in charge of more than 100 putative class action lawsuits brought against the NCAA, its member institutions, and its conferences on behalf of college football players who allege they suffered repeated concussions. The case has been described as one of the largest actions pending in the country. Edelson PC leads a number of actions on behalf of governmental entities and labor unions in lawsuits against drug manufacturers and distributors over the opioid epidemic, and was recently endorsed by the Illinois Coalition of Local Governments to pursue these lawsuits on behalf of municipalities. Representative cases Edelson PC filed numerous class actions arising in the aftermath of the federal bailouts of US banks (e.g., Citibank, Chase, and Wells Fargo). The lawsuits alleged the banks unlawfully suspended home credit lines based on pre-textual reasons, and that certain banks failed to honor loan modification programs. Edelson PC achieved the first federal appellate decision in the country recognizing the right of Wells Fargo borrowers to enforce HAMP trial plans under state law. The eventual settlements exceeded $3 billion in home equity lines of credit. Jay Edelson was appointed co-lead counsel in lead paint recall litigation involving Thomas the Tank toy trains. Edelson PC eventually reached a settlement valued at over $30 million, which provided the class with full cash refunds and reimbursement of certain costs related to blood testing. Edelson PC prosecuted more than 100 cases on behalf of consumers who allegedly received unauthorized charges on their mobile phone bills, settling numerous nationwide class actions, including against industry leader AT&T; Mobility, collectively worth more than $100 million. Notable cases Spokeo v. Robbins: Edelson PC successfully argued to the United States Supreme Court that a plaintiff can have standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution by alleging that a website published inaccurate information about him, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Birchmeier v. Caribbean Cruise Lines, et al.: In the largest Telephone Consumer Protection Act settlement to date, Edelson PC secured $76 million in relief for a class of consumers alleged to have been spammed with telemarketing calls. Mullen v. GLV, Inc., et al: Edelson PC brought a class action on behalf of several parents for failure to disclose sexual abuse occurring within Sports Performance Volleyball Club. Its owners, Rick and Cheryl Butler, are charged with withholding and misrepresented information about the sexual abuse allegations against Rick Butler. Edelson PC represented that it would donate any attorney's fees received in the case to charity. The case is one of the first sexual abuse cases to be granted class actions status. Harris, et al. v. comScore, Inc.: Edelson PC was appointed class counsel in a suit alleging improper data collecting practices by one of the world's largest internet analytics companies and successfully certified a class estimated by several sources to be the largest privacy case ever certified on an adversarial basis. In re Facebook Privacy Litigation: Edelson PC filed the first of its kind class action against Facebook under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act.

E@I started as an informal international work group in 1999, before it was officially registered in Slovakia in 2005. E@I's activities include the development of educational websites (lernu! and Slovake.eu, among others); publishing, such as books and DVDs; and organizing conferences and seminars, including the biennial KAEST and the Esperanto Wikimania in 2011. A specialist group within the organization is dedicated to Wikipedia. E@I is a member organization of the Council of Europe's European Youth Foundation and one of the 29 organizations represented in the European Commission's Civil Society Platform for Multlingualism. Projects run by the organization have been subsidized by the Esperantic Studies Foundation and the European Commission's Youth in Action programme and Lifelong Learning Programme (through EACEA). The coordinator of E@I's activities is Peter Bal√°≈æ, who was elected Esperantist of the Year 2012 in a poll held by the magazine La Ondo de Esperanto.  History  The Idea of E@I began in November 1999. A conference of the same name was soon held in April 2000 in Tollare, Sweden. As a result of this meeting, an international group with the same name was started. During the 56th IJK (International Youth Congress of Esperanto) in Hong Kong, Henning von Rosen and Hokan Lundberg presented the ideas and goals of E@I. In 2001, E@I registered their website, ikso.net. At the same time, the charitable foundation \\"E@I\\" was created in the cadre of UEA/TEJO. The second Esperanto@Interreto conference took place in October 2001 in Uppsala. The third conference followed in 2002. This conference was a collaboration with non-Esperantists, and was bilingual Esperanto/English. In between 2002 and 2004, many of E@I's projects were in development, especially lernu!, Lingva Prismo and Interkulturo. The first board of directors was also created, consisting of 5 members. On 14 November 2005, E@I was registered as a civil association in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Slovakia. E@I decided to officially register itself as \\"E@I\\" instead of the expanded \\"Esperanto@Interreto\\". On 1 August 2007, a new board of directors was inaugurated with the head position held by Peter Bal√°≈æ. In 2007, E@I was accepted as a member of the EYF (European Youth Foundation). E@I continues to work on its various internet projects and conferences today. The most recently completed project being, Slovake.eu, the first website dedicated to learning the Slovak language for which E@I has received a subsidy of 256,000 euros from the European Commission's EACEA. E@I has also started allowing university students to do internships through the Erasmus Programme. In February 2012, Peter Bal√°≈æ, Indre Pileckytƒó, Jevgenij Gaus and Neringa Gaus toured China as a result of the increasing number of Chinese lernu! users, and to possibly start a conference similar to SES in China.  Internal structure  E@I is regulated by a statute under which a 3 to 9 member board of directors runs the organization. The other sections of E@I are its elected commission, its financial commission, and its members. = Members = Members of E@I are those who have agreed to the terms of the statute of E@I and have sent the necessary information to E@I. Those in between the ages of 15 and 35 are considered regular members. Some people are considered special members without having voting rights. E@I membership is free of charge. According to the E@I website,\\"Members\\" in the official website of E@I there are now around 20 thousand members. = Board of directors = The board of directors inaugurated on August 1, 2007 includes: * Peter Bal√°≈æ ‚Äì Coordinating and project planning * Marek Blahu≈° ‚Äì General secretary * Jevgenij Gaus ‚Äì Administration of web projects * Yves Nevelsteen ‚Äì treasurer The original board of directors was elected in April 2003, and consisted of Chuck Smith, Hokan Lundberg, Nastja Koƒµevnikova, Ralf Fr√∂lich and Sonja Petroviƒá.EcheI: RaportoBostono = Employees and interns = Starting 2010, E@I accepted university students as interns who usually work for a few months on various E@I projects. = Office = On the 1 June 2011, the town of Partiz√°nske and its major, Jozef Bo≈æik, decided to give E@I its own office in downtown Partiz√°nske, for the symbolic cost of 1 euro per year.  Activity  = Seminars = In the first few years of its existence, training on education and the internet were a regular part of the development of E@I, aiding it in finding many new members. For its first few years, E@I was a scholarly branch of TEJO. As a result, E@I's first few seminars were a collaboration with TEJO. * E@I-2000 ‚Äì Esperanto@Interreto ‚Äì Stockholm (Sweden) ‚Äì April 16 to 22, 2000 * E@I-2001 ‚Äì Rete Kunlabori ‚Äì Uppsala (Sweden) ‚Äì October 27 to November 4, 2001TEJO-seminario Esperanto@Interreto 2001 (Archive copy) * E@I-2002 ‚Äì Rete Lingvumi ‚Äì ƒåaƒçak (Yugoslavia) ‚Äì April 28 to May 5, 2002TEJO: Seminarioj ‚Äì Esperanto@Interreto-2002 * E@I-4 ‚Äì Rete Informadi ‚Äì Lesj√∂fors (Sweden) ‚Äì October 26 to November 3, 2002EsperantoCxeInterretoLesxeforsx (Archive copy) * E@I-5 ‚Äì Rete Lerni ‚Äì Boston (United States) ‚Äì April 19 to 26, 2003 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)Kelkaj fotoj de Esperanto@Interreto- Bostono (Archive copy) * E@I-6 ‚Äì Rete Interkulturumi - Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) ‚Äì March 21 to 27, 2004Interkulturaj Intersxangxoj en Sarajevo * E@I-7 ‚Äì Ni sciigu aliajn pri ni ‚Äì Partiz√°nske (Slovakia) - June 4 to 11, 2005EsperantoCxeInterretoPartizanske (Bosnia and Herzegovina) * E@I-8 ‚Äì Lingvoj en interreto ‚Äì Brno (Czech Republic) ‚Äì November 4 to 12, 2006 = SES = Starting in 2007, E@I has arranged a conference every summer entitled SES.

Life Daly was born at Dunsandle Castle, Loughrea, the newly built residence of his father, Denis Daly. His ancestor, Dermot √ì Daly (fl. 1574‚Äì1614) was a Roman Catholic of Gaelic descent but his grandfather and father had converted to the Protestant faith to ensure legal title on their lands. By 1800, the family were among the largest land-owners in Ireland and dictated the mayoralty of Galway for some sixty years. His mother was Lady Henrietta Maxwell, only daughter of Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham and Henrietta Cantillon, widow of the 3rd Earl of Strafford. Daly graduated with a B.A. from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1803, was ordained deacon and then priest of the Church of Ireland, and became Rector of Powerscourt in 1814. He was leader of the Evangelical section of the church, the subject at the centre of most of his publications, which numbered over twenty-two between 1815 and his death. Daly was passionate in his support of anti-Catholic missions: his passionate hatred of the Irish Catholic church, and especially its priests, endured to the end of his life. He was one of the founders in 1818 of the controversial Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language. Daly also supported the setting up of Church Education Society in 1839 countering the setting up of the National School system in Ireland. He was appointed Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin in 1842; and Bishop of Cashel and Waterford in 1843 and was serving in that capacity when he died in 1872.

He held office from 1698 to 1727, being elected to office 30 times (twice in 1698), and served as governor longer than any other individual in the history of both the colony and the state of Rhode Island. The son of former Rhode Island Governor John Cranston, he was born in Newport and lived there his entire life. Going to sea as a young man, he was captured by pirates, and held captive for several years before returning to his family. Cranston had very little political experience when he was first elected as governor of the colony upon the resignation of Walter Clarke in March 1698. The issues that he dealt with during his first three years in office were so critical, that the continued existence of the Rhode Island colony was at stake. One of the major issues of his early tenure was that of piracy, as many privateers who were active in the recent war with France turned to piracy. The crown wanted piracy stopped, while many colonists were sympathetic to the pirates, and Cranston had to make difficult political decisions to satisfy the home country on this issue. Another ongoing issue was the disputed boundary between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. The Narragansett country was given to both colonies by their respective charters, creating many decades of friction. During Cranston's tenure as governor, the dispute was finally ended, entirely in Rhode Island's favor. The most formidable issue facing the colony began in 1698 with the arrival of Lord Bellomont as Governor of New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Bellomont took an immediate dislike to the governance of Rhode Island, documenting numerous irregularities in the way it operated, and sending copious documentation to the Board of Trade in England. Bellomont wanted the Rhode Island colony to be removed from its charter, and put under closer royal supervision. He would likely have been successful in his quest, had he not died in 1701. Following Cranston's decisiveness and firmness during the first three years of his tenure, he became extremely popular with the people of the colony, and while virtually every other politician of his era fell by the wayside, he was able to stand the political upheavals of his day, continuing to be elected as governor every year until his death in 1727. His first wife was Mary Hart, a granddaughter of Roger Williams, and his second wife was the widow of his younger brother, Caleb. Cranston is buried in the Common Burying Ground in Newport, and shares a large marker with his father.  Early life  The son of former Rhode Island Governor John Cranston, Cranston was born in Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and lived there his entire life. His mother was Mary Clarke, the daughter of an early colonial President, Jeremiah Clarke. The oldest of ten children, he was educated as a youth, and became a merchant as a young adult, with his trade being that of a goldsmith. In 1684, at the age of 24, Cranston became a freeman from Newport. Bicknell relates an interesting personal experience Cranston had as a young man. After he was married, he went to sea and was captured by pirates and not heard from for many years. Thinking he was dead, his wife arranged to marry a Mr. Russell of Boston. Cranston managed to gain his freedom and made his way back to Newport, arriving the evening of his wife's wedding. He found his wife before the marriage ceremony, and the event was turned into a celebration for his return, with the groom-to-be surrendering his expected bride with good grace. Cranston was in his late 30s when he began his political career, becoming an Assistant in 1696. Two years later, in 1698, he was chosen as Major for the militia of the island (Portsmouth and Newport), and the same year, with virtually no political experience, he was selected as governor for the colony, when his brother-in-law, Walter Clarke, resigned from that position.  Governorship  = Piracy = Captain William Kidd, privateer turned pirate, whom all colonial governors were directed to seize if found Elected as governor for the first time in March 1698 upon Clarke's resignation, Cranston was elected again two months later at the May meeting of the General Assembly, and re-elected every May thereafter through 1726, for a total of 30 times being elected to the highest office in the colony. One of the first acts of the new administration was to deal with the serious issue of piracy, which had sprung from the licensed privateering that the colonies had fostered during the recent war with France. These privateers, with roving commissions against the French had become open pirates after peace was attained. All of New England, New York, and the West Indies were deeply involved in these unlawful enterprises. The Act of 1698 prohibited piracy, had all improperly gained property confiscated, and punished the offenders. An address to the King was prepared confessing the remissness of the colony in respect to the acts of trade, and mentioning the new statute concerning the act of piracy. That the colony assumed admiralty jurisdiction during the late war was admitted and defended on the ground of expediency because of the need to annoy French commerce, and the fact that there was then no Admiralty Court established in the colony. The letter concluded with the request for royal favor in allowing the colony to continue under its charter. This letter and other papers were enclosed with a letter from Cranston to the Board of Trade apologizing for irregularities of the colony in refusing the quota of troops for New York, and explaining charges against it in regards to piracy. He also stated that two men suspected of piracy would be brought to trial. A bitter letter against the government of the colony was soon after written by \\"that old enemy of New England,\\" Edward Randolph, the Surveyor General of Customs, who had just been to New York to welcome the arrival of its new governor, Lord Bellomont. The charges against the Rhode Island colony were most serious, including complicity with pirates, by whom many were enriched; the letter also wrongly suggested that many of the people desired a royal governor and would pay 500 pounds a year for his support. At the October 1698 session of the General Assembly, provision was made for the reception of Lord Bellomont, who was expected soon from New York on his way to Boston. A commission was named to prepare a digest of laws to send to England, and another commission was formed to present the issue of the colony's western boundary with Connecticut to Bellomont. At the same time, additional letters were sent by the Board of Trade in England to the colonies on the subject of piracy. Rhode Island's agent in England, Jaleel Brenton (son of Governor William Brenton), asked that all privateering papers be sent to England, with an account of the trials of some of the pirates. Letters from England gave instructions to the custom house officers on how to conduct their business and included an order from the British Cabinet to the governors of all the colonies to apprehend the notorious Captain Kidd should he appear in their waters. = Irregularities in the colony's affairs = In December 1698 the Board of Trade made a formal representation to the King concerning the many irregularities of the Rhode Island colony, specifically charging it with refusal to take oaths, encouraging illegal traffic, assuming admiralty jurisdiction to themselves and resisting it from the crown, and other flagrant acts of disloyalty. They went on to recommend that a commission of inquiry be sent to Lord Bellomont to examine these matters with the view to issuing a quo warranto against Rhode Island's charter. Also, the board made inquiries of Mr. Brenton, then in London, about the extraordinary militia power of the colony, to which he replied that it had been conferred by the charter, but that the Assembly recently gave to the militia the power to select its own officers. In May 1699 Brenton informed the colony of actions taken by the government of Connecticut, which now claimed a great part of Warwick and Providence as well as all of the Narragansett country under the jurisdiction of King's Province. Cranston wrote a long letter to the Board of Trade, deprecating the many false reports against the Rhode Island colony that were mostly circulated by Randolph. At the same time, Lord Bellomont, who remained in New York for a year, moved to Boston. He was afflicted with gout, which, Arnold wrote, \\"seems to have affected his temper to the detriment of Rhode Island interests.\\" = Lord Bellomont, enemy of Rhode Island = Bellomont's purpose at this time was to break up the piracy that had grown out of privateering, an extremely difficult task, as many of the leading families in both New York and New England were involved in it. He succeeded in enticing Captain Kidd to come to Boston, where he was seized and imprisoned. Kidd had many friends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the state of affairs in the colonies was such that some pirates were allowed to escape from incarceration. With the many letters that Bellomont sent home this year were nearly 100 documents in support of the charges against the Rhode Island colony. To further his designs upon Rhode Island, and to aid in securing other pirates known to resort there, Bellemont commissioned the three members of the Admiralty Court, Brinley, Sanford and Coddington, to collect evidence and use their efforts to capture some of Kidd's confederates. They accepted the trust, but deplored the difficulties because of sympathy felt everywhere for the freebooters. Lord Bellomont was bent on removing Rhode Island from its chartered government for \\"irregularites.\\" The feeling of the home government was expressed in a letter of August 1699 written by the Board of Trade in reply to a letter written by Cranston in May. The language was very severe, blaming the colony for sending only an abstract of the laws when a full copy was required, and sharply rebuking them for their encouragement of piracy, citing privateer commissions granted by Deputy Governor John Greene in 1694. The urgency of these affairs led Cranston to call a special session of the Assembly in Newport in August in which were discussed the pending visit of Bellomont to Rhode Island along with funding for the visit, the boundary issue with Connecticut, and the need for funds to hire another agent to join Brenton in England to defend the colony against the attacks of its enemies. Bellomont left a diary of his visit to Rhode Island and its proceedings. On the first day he was met at Bristol ferry by Cranston and a troop of horse, and escorted to Newport where a meeting of the council was held, and the royal commission read. The next day Bellomont's instructions to inquire into the mal-administration of Rhode Island's affairs were read to the council, and former Rhode Island governors Walter Clarke and John Easton were examined upon several points charged, as were Cranston, Greene and Peleg Sanford. The troublesome subject of oaths was minutely examined‚Äîthe scruples of many in Rhode Island upon this subject (particularly Quakers) was incomprehensible to the English officers. Governor Winthrop of Connecticut arrived with his commissioners to discuss the Narragansett dispute. The conflicting clauses in both colonies' charters were read, as was the earlier agreement between John Clarke and the first Governor Winthrop. The case was argued on both sides, but no mutual agreement could be reached. Bellomont ordered each side to prepare a statement of their claims along with affidavits and then to send their agents to England to place the matter before the King. Further examinations in regards to piracy continued to evolve. Caleb and Josias Arnold (both sons of Governor Benedict Arnold) were added as members of the Admiralty Court as commissioners to collect evidence upon piracy charges, and the governor and his council were requested to aid them in their work. Bellomont, having finished his business in Rhode Island placed the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut under bonds of 3000 pounds each to enforce the acts against pirates, and later wrote Cranston with thanks for his hospitality, and for directing the arrest of a pirate who had escaped to Rhode Island. An acceptable copy of the laws and acts of council of the colony was requested, a task not easy to perform in the disordered state of the records, but Cranston, in his reply, promised it would be done. In November 1699 depositions in regard to pirates were taken and forwarded to England by Lord Bellomont, with a letter denouncing the government of Rhode Island as \\"the most irregular and illegal in their administration that ever any English government was.\\" His criticisms were amply sustained by the complaints constantly sent to him by the admiralty commissioners at Newport. Sanford claimed that any commission from his Majesty was considered an infringement of the charter privileges, and those who took them were looked upon as enemies of the state. At length, Bellomont, having collected a massive set of evidence to support charges against Rhode Island, made his report to the Privy Council. It was a formidable document, presenting, under 25 distinct headings, an array of testimony against the Rhode Island colony \\"which we can only wonder...that the friendless colony was enabled to resist,\\" wrote Arnold. He continued, \\"That she was not utterly crushed beneath the cumulative evidence of every kind of irregularity that was hurled upon her by the indefatigable zeal and the consummate ability of Bellomont, can scarcely be accounted for by any human agency. It is the greatest marvel in the history of Rhode Island in the seventeenth century. She had had many narrow escapes, but this was the most wonderful of them all.\\" Immediately following this report, Bellomont sent a letter to the Board of Trade on the subject of piracy, denouncing Cranston for \\"conniving at pirates, and making Rhode Island their sanctuary.\\" In a separate issue, he also directed that taxes not be collected in the Narragansett country until the dispute with Connecticut had been resolved. The best way for the Assembly to act on this prohibition was to ignore it. However, some people in Westerly refused to elect tax assessors for the tax to send an agent to England. Upon news of this, Cranston issued a warrant for the arrest of several persons who had signed a protest against the said election, and appointed a special constable with a sufficient force to serve the warrant. Arnold writes, \\"The firmness of Cranston at this crisis, did more than any other one cause to save the colony from extinction.\\" In December 1699 a fair copy of the laws and acts of the colony was finally sent to Bellomont, with a letter explaining the delay. Captain Joseph Sheffield, one of the Assistants, carried the letter with the purpose of being an envoy to soothe the anger of the Earl. The reply from the commissioners the next day declared that the copy of the laws was neither complete nor correct, and condemned the arrests made at Westerly. The colony's laws were sent to the Board of Trade with abundant annotations and denunciations by Bellomont. The Board of Trade, upon receipt of Bellomont's report, sent an abstract to the King in April 1700, recommending that the law officers of the crown consider what would be most proper for bringing the colony under a better form of government. At the May elections in 1700, John Greene, who had been deputy governor for ten years, was dropped, and former Governor Walter Clarke was chosen in his place. At the close of the Assembly Cranston addressed a petition to the King imploring the continuance of the charter. He also wrote the Board of Trade informing them that the late deputy governor had been left out of all offices of trust at the recent election on account of his illegally granting privateer commissions several years earlier. He also added that a more perfect copy of the laws was to be made, and that a new form of engagement had just been adopted to meet the views of the home government. It was a well drafted and diplomatic letter designed to aid the efforts of Brenton in averting another quo warranto. The Earl of Bellomont was ready with a rejoinder, sustained by documentary proof. He wrote to the Board that he had given up all attempts at reducing the disorders in Rhode Island, and he forwarded papers relating to the seizure and trial of the Westerly prisoners. Then in March 1701 an event of the greatest importance to the people of Rhode Island occurred. The death of the Earl of Bellomont at New York removed the most formidable opponent to the charter of Rhode Island who had ever ruled in New England. \\"Unlike Sir Edmund Andros,\\" Arnold wrote, \\"Bellomont could neither be moved by flattery nor softened by courtesy.\\" He \\"rebuked the free spirit of a people who virtually set at defiance the laws that he was appointed to execute.\\" = Mid tenure issues = William Penn interceded on behalf of Rhode Island, allowing that it should retain its charter despite recommendations of the Board of Trade and Joseph Dudley In 1702 the General Assembly ordered that a fortification be built at Newport with 12 pieces of ordnance. The same year, Governor Joseph Dudley of Massachusetts visited Newport, claiming to act under the authority of the King and Queen as \\"Captain-General of all forces, forts, and places of strength.\\" He demanded a review of the colonial militia, which was denied by Governor Cranston. By the same authority, Dudley claimed admiralty jurisdiction over the Rhode Island colony, which was also denied, but was later granted by order of the new sovereign in England, Queen Anne. The ambitious designs of Dudley to overthrow the charter of Rhode Island were supported by the English Board of Trade, which recognized him as Governor of the Rhode Island colony. Fortunately for the colony, the great influence of William Penn with Queen Anne and her Privy Council kept this from happening. In 1703 the boundary line between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies, in dispute for more than half a century, was agreed upon as the same line given in Rhode Island's charter, and as it would stand during statehood. The colony was divided into two counties‚ÄîRhode Island encompassing the islands in the Narragansett Bay and Block Island, and Providence Plantations, including all of the land west of the bay. The African slave trade had been opened to all English merchants in 1702 by an act of Parliament. Rhode Island obtained most of its slaves from Barbados, receiving about 25 per year at a cost of about 35 pounds each. In 1708 a duty of three pounds was placed on every negro imported into the colony. The first general census of the colony took place in 1708 when 7181 inhabitants were tallied, including 1015 freemen, 426 black servants, and 56 white servants. The militia force consisted of 1362 males from the ages of 16 to 60, each required to have a musket, sword or bayonet, powder, and bullets. = Hard vs soft money = To meet the extraordinary expenses of outfitting men and transports for the colony's use during the current French and Indian War, known as Queen Anne's War, an act was passed in July 1710 for the issue of bills of credit in the amount of 5000 pounds. While supported by the farmers, this policy had a detrimental effect on the merchants, best summarized by historian Samuel G. Arnold, \\"Thus commenced in Rhode Island a system of paper money issues fraught with disaster to the commercial interests of the Colony, whose baleful influence was to extend over nearly a century, distracting alike the political, financial, and even the social condition of the people, and which was to be the occasion of most bitter partisan strife long after the Revolutionary War had left us an independent State.\\" Cranston, who had approved the first paper money issue was called to \\"repeat the folly again and again.\\" This policy led to the creation of two parties, the specie, or hard-money party, and the paper-money party. This division caused a major turnover in the election of May 1714, when the hard-money party triumphed, and only six out of 28 Deputies returned to the General Assembly. The following election in May 1715 was even more dramatic, and called the \\"great revolution.\\" Deputy Governor Henry Tew was deposed, and replaced by Joseph Jenckes of Providence, and every Assistant but one was replaced, and only five of 28 Deputies were returned to office. Cranston was able to weather the storm, being considered too able and being too respected by both parties to be removed from office. = Late tenure events = Queen Anne's War had ended in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht, restoring peace to the world, and beginning a new era for Rhode Island. The intense theological debates and dogmas were replaced with discussions of business, politics, trade, and finance. A variety of legislation was enacted during the final ten years of Cranston's time in office. In 1718 a new and complete militia law was enacted in which the Governor was declared the \\"Captain-General and Commander in Chief.\\" The following year saw the first edition of the laws of Rhode Island printed in Boston. In 1723 the first almshouse in Rhode Island was erected in Newport, and in 1725 the mainland towns were empowered to build a house of correction for vagrants and \\"mad persons,\\" the first reference to a reformatory and philanthropic institution.  Family, death and legacy  Cranston married first Mary Hart, the daughter of Thomas Hart and Freeborn Williams, and the granddaughter of Providence founder Roger Williams, with whom he had seven children. The year after Mary's death in 1710, Cranston married Judith (Parrott) Cranston, the widow of his younger brother Caleb. Cranston died on April 26, 1727 in Newport, while still in office. He was buried in the Common Burial Ground in Newport, beside his father. A large and elaborate slate slab contains an inscription for himself and for his father, with a coat-of-arms in the middle of the top. He also has a governor's medallion in front of his grave. Rhode Island historian Samuel G. Arnold wrote of him, \\"The administration of Governor Cranston is remarkable for many reasons. He held his position probably longer than any other man who has ever been subjected to the test of an annual popular election. He was thirty times successively chosen governor, holding office till his death, in 1726 [1727]. His great firmness in seasons of unexampled trial, that occurred in the early part of his public life, is, perhaps, the key to his wonderful popularity...\\"  Ancestry of Samuel and Mary Cranston  See also * William May, Richard Want, Joseph Faro, Thomas Tew, and Peter Lawrence - some of the privateers who turned pirate, whom Cranston was accused of supporting * List of colonial governors of Rhode Island * List of lieutenant governors of Rhode Island * Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations References = Bibliography =   = Further reading =  External links * (The cemetery is incorrectly given as Island Cemetery, but he is buried in the adjacent Common Burial Ground) *Chronological list of Rhode Island leaders Category:1659 births Category:1727 deaths Category:Colonial governors of Rhode Island Category:Politicians from Newport, Rhode Island Category:Burials at Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery Category:Clarke family (Rhode Island) ","title":"Samuel Cranston"},{"id":"26711911","text":"Woodbury High School, formerly Woodbury Senior High, is a high school serving grades 912 in Woodbury, Minnesota, United States.

Student Elliot Chambers reacted by wearing a makeshift sweatshirt with the slogan \\"Straight Pride\\" and the image of male and female stick figures holding hands. In light of previous anti-gay incidents, the school's principal ordered Chambers to remove the shirt, and a court case ensued. A court upheld Chambers' complaint that his First Amendment rights had been violated, and that the principal's decision was unjustified. Although praising the principal's intentions, the judge explained that views of both sides of the debate should be allowed and that such issues should be resolved within the school's community, not within the court system. Under the Tinker case, the court stated that the substantial disruptions claimed by the school must be shown to have some connection to Chambers' sweatshirt message of \\"Straight Pride\\".

Ricardo Baroja y Nessi (12 January 1871 ‚Äì 19 December 1953) was a Spanish painter, writer and engraver. As an engraver, he is considered the successor of Francisco Goya.http://www.josedelamano.com/josedelamanoenglish/pages/ricardobaroja_b.html He was the brother of the novelist P√≠o Baroja and writer/ethnologist Carmen Baroja. Carmen was the mother of anthropologist Julio Caro Baroja and director/screenwriter P√≠o Caro Baroja. Early life Ricardo's father, Serafin Baroja, was a mining engineer and the itinerant nature of his profession caused Ricardo to be born in Minas de R√≠o Tinto, in the Province of Huelva (Spain), an ancient mining village since the time of the Phoenicians in Andalus√≠a. Soon after his birth the R√≠o Tinto Mines were sold to a consortium from the United Kingdom and Australia, the Rio Tinto Group, and so the family returned to San Sebasti√°n. In 1879, when Ricardo was eight, the family moved to Madrid, but two years later, they were living on the banks of the R√≠o Arga in Pamplona, and they were in Bilbao in 1886. At fifteen, Ricardo attended the Polytechnic School of Engineering in Madrid in an attempt to follow in his father's career as a mining engineer. While there, he had an attack of tuberculosis, a disease from which his elder brother, Dario (1869‚Äì1894), was suffering. Alarmed, his parents withdrew him from the school so he could recover. Later, following his love for art he studied museology at the Cuerpo de Archivos y Bibliotecas (1888‚Äì1891) so that he could work in museums. He also attended a painting academy studying with Eugene Viv√≥. In 1890 he travelled to the art circles of M√°laga and Val√®ncia and was inspired by the older painters Francisco Domingo Marqu√©s and Ignacio Pinazo Camarlench. At Valencia, he met the painter Julio Peris Brell with whom he struck up a lifelong friendship. In 1894, he went to Madrid to help his maternal aunt, Juana Nessi, run her bakery after the death of her husband, Mattias Lacasa. His younger brother, P√≠o, arrived to help out by making the Viennese bread and tea at her bakery, Viena Capellanes.http://madridhaciaarriba.blogspot.com/2008/08/viena-capellanes.html However, the brothers were more interested in their artistic endeavors. Ricardo was painting as well as illustrating the books his brother was now writing.http://www.sightseeing-madrid.com/quality-fast-food-viena- capellanes.php During this time, in 1896, he read a science book about etching and engraving.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=http://fcom.us.es/blogs/tecnicasdegrabado/tag/ricardo- baroja/&ei;=VxrFS_yyBpT6NdXpvZwO&sa;=X&oi;=translate&ct;=result&resnum4;&ved;=0CBoQ7gEwAw&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Dla%2Bestampa%2B%252B%2BRicardo%2BBaroja%26hl%3Den When his aunt died the brothers sold the bakery and Ricardo became a kind of Bohemian archivist working at the Archivo de C√°ceres and, for short periods, at the library in Bilbao. In 1900, he worked for the tax office in Teruel and at the provincial library of Segovia, where he decided to end his career as a civil servant. He had always wanted to work in museums and had only achieved the bureaucratic tedium of filing and cataloging which went against his restless nature, and so he went on to pursue the bohemian life of the artist. Early 20th century Ricardo belonged to the Generation of '98, a group of writers, philosophers, musicians and artists disillusioned with the reality that Spain was slowly losing its empire as well as its moral, political and spiritual compass. They met at various tertulias in Madrid to discuss its causes and attempt to seek out remedies for Spain's regeneration.http://www.sispain.org/english/language/1898.html He later published his Diario de Madrid that told about those times as Gente del 98 (1952; People of the Generation of '98). In those early days, art and literature did not provide enough to live on so upon hearing accounts of buried treasure, Ricardo set out armed and on horseback with his close friend Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n for the ancient mercury mines of Almad√©n in La Mancha in search of an undiscovered trove. This adventure ended when Valle-Incl√°n accidentally shot himself in the arm and foot.Robert Lima, Valle-Incl√°n: The Theatre of His Life, (1988), p.61. On March 31, 1901, with Pablo Picasso and Francisco de As√≠s Soler, an editor, he started a magazine, Arte Joven (Young Art), publishing five issues using the pseudonym \\"Juan Gualberto Nessi\\", which was actually his birth name.http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=http://riotinto.mforos.com/555733/3942958-riotintos- en-la- historia/&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Djuan%2Bgualberto%2Bnessi%26hl%3Den&rurl;=translate.google.com&usg;=ALkJrhhjtKlHkfyF21Y4x1fEnPjkzrU91A In 1903, he and his brother were war correspondents in Morocco, writing for the journal El Globo. He began etching in 1900 and showed in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts of 1901, 1906, 1910, 1912, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1930 and 1936, winning a second-place medal in 1906 and a first-place medal in 1908 for several etchings. On 31 May 1906, Mateu Morral, a Catalan anarchist, threw a bomb from a balcony on the Calle Mayor at the ceremonial coach of Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenia of Battenberg during their nuptial festivities. Failing in his attempted assassination, and with the Guardia Civil close on his heels, Morral committed suicide in Torrej√≥n de Ardoz. Morral's body was identified not by political cronies but by Valle-Incl√°n and Ricardo Baroja, who had met the regicidal Catalan during the tertulias at the Horchateria de Candelas in Madrid.Robert Lima, Valle-Incl√°n: The Theatre of His Life, (1988), p.78. Later, Ricardo drew a picture and an etching of Morral while Valle-Incl√°n and P√≠o portrayed him as the anarchist in their later writings.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=http://www.marcianos.com/enc/mateo_morrales.html&ei;=5i_CS9OAMed=0CCoQ7gEwCQ&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Dhorchateria%2Bde%2candelas%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1R2RNTN_enUS364 In 1910, he co-founded the Society of Spanish Engravers, which regrouped as Los 24. They published about etching techniques in three issues of the journal La Estampa before being asked to publish in Circulo de Bellas Artes. In 1917, his first novel, Aventuras del submarino aleman U..., was published. He also assisted his brother-in-law, editor Rafael Caro Raggio (the husband of his sister Carmen), at his newly founded publishing house with the printing of Biblioteca de Arte, and in 1920, he published his second novel, Fernanda.http://www.losbaroja.com/ingles/mundobaroja.asp In 1925, in a highly publicized conference at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, without giving names, he attacked the current vogue of art critics, specifically, Ricardo Guti√©rrez Abascal (Juan de la Encina) and Jos√© Franc√©s (1883‚Äì1964). The conference had a great impact, and critics now ostracised him. Theatre and film On 5 September 1915, a theatre, Compa√±ia de Mar√≠a Guerrero, premiered his first play, El Cometa (The Comet), in Bilbao. In 1919, at 48, he married his faithful partner, Carmen Monn√©. Also an artist, she was from an American family of French origin. They had met at the home of the painter Valentin Zubiaurre. On 8 February 1926, they inaugurated their amateur theatre group El Mirlo Blanco (The White Blackbird) at their home in Madrid, with the support of many intellectuals and notable playwrights such as Valle-Incl√°n, Edgar Neville, Cipriano Rivas Cherif and Claudio de la Torre (1895‚Äì1973). The following year, the group was dissolved by the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, leading to protests. In 1928, Ricardo was appointed professor at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Gr√°ficas and returned to engraving, which he had abandoned since the death of his father in 1912. In these days, he frequented the tertulias (social gatherings) at the Cacharrer√≠a, Valle-Incl√°n's group at the Caf√© la Granja de Henar and the Caf√© Varela tertulia of Antonio Machado and his brother Manuel. He also acted in Nemesio M. Sobrevila's silent films, Al Hollywood Madrile√±o (1927; In Hollywood Madrid),http://cinema.theiapolis.com/movie-2KPU/al-hollywood- madrileno/storyline.html and the avant-garde El Sexto sentido (The Sixth Sense),http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/S/Sextosentido1929.html a film that was far ahead of its timehttp://www.europafilmtreasures.eu/FT/276/about-the- film-the_sixth_sense and only had one public screening in 1929. El Sexto sentido is now considered a classic art film.http://www.silentera.com/info/top100nomMZ.html In 1931, returning from a rally in support of the Second Spanish Republic, he lost his right eye in an automobile accident in Navalcarnero, near Madrid, which forced him to abandon painting and engraving and devote himself to writing. He was awarded the National Prize for Literature in 1935 for his novel La Nao Capitana. Later, it was adapted into a film starring Paola Barbara and Jes√∫s Tordesillas in (1947).http://www.decine21.com/Peliculas/La-nao-capitana-8594 Spanish Civil War The sudden uprising of the Spanish Civil War saw the home of Carmen and Ricardo destroyed in a bombing raid along with all his literary work. Taken completely by surprise, the new refugees went to stay at Itzea, P√≠o's home in Vera de Bidasoa in northern Navarre. P√≠o had fled to France and the family remained at Itzea for the duration of the war, cut off from family and friends and painting and writing only during the summer months. During this time, he painted 70 Itzea tables with the themes of war, perhaps the largest contribution of any artist to the disasters of the Spanish Civil War. Afterward Baroja's house in Vera de Bidasoa In 1940, he held exhibitions at galleries in San Sebasti√°n, Bilbao and Madrid; he even began to compose music. In 1949, along with the painter Ascensio Martiarena Lascurain, he founded the Asociaci√≥n Art√≠stica de Guip√∫zcoa (Art Association of Guip√∫zcoa) and held two art exhibitions in San Sebasti√°n; one of etchings (January) and the other of oils (August). At his last exhibition in San Sebasti√°n (1952), all his paintings were sold. He was 81 and almost blind. In 1926, his good friend Valle-Incl√°n wrote in the prologue for Ricardo's new book, El Pedigree, remarking on the merit of his companion: > Ricardo Baroja is loved by the Muses. Not one of the nine sisters has denied > him her gift. Had he pursued the graphic arts, he would have outdone the > best. I imagine him in an Italian city, a painter in the days of the > Renaissance. That rare ability to conceive and to execute quickly makes him > brilliantly capable of doing grand mural works. What paradoxical humor he > would have shown in training his disciples from the scaffolding, in > welcoming rulers, in having discussions with cardinals! Verbal grace, frank > humor, pleasant laughter, paradoxical flights are also distinctive in > Ricardo Baroja - beloved of the Muses - who, eschewing romantic sputterings, > heads toward old age.Robert Lima, Valle-Incl√°n: The Theatre of His Life, > (1988), p.150 He died on 19 December 1953 in Vera de Bidosoa of tongue cancer caused by his fondness for pipe smoking and snuff. In March 1959, his widow, Carmen Monn√©, organized an exhibition in homage to Ricardo at the Salas Municipales de Arte (Chambers Municipal Art Gallery) of San Sebasti√°n. Their old friends, the Ducloux sisters, were responsible for gathering all the works available from valuable private collections. In 1995 the town council of his birthplace, Minas de R√≠o Tinto, renamed a street to Avenida Ricardo Baroja. Writings *Aventuras del submarino aleman U...

Checcarelli (Editor), 2007, Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science, Springer. Life and career of Ferdinand Freudenstein In his Ph.D dissertation, Freudenstein developed what is to become the Freudenstein Equation, which uses a simple algebraic method to synthesize planar four-bar function generators. Freudenstein spent his entire career working and teaching in Columbia University as the Higgins Professor of Mechanical Engineering. Over his life- time, Freudenstein mentored over 500 Ph.D. students in hundreds of universities across the world. Early life Ferdinand Freudenstein was born into a Jewish family, on May 12, 1926, in Frankfurt, Germany. He was the son of a successful merchant George Freudenstein and Charlotte Rosenberg. At the age of ten, Freudenstein with his parents and two sisters fled Nazi Germany for refuge in the Netherlands. In the spring of 1937, Freudenstein moved to England after having spent six months in the city of Amsterdam. In England, he joined his brother and studied in London. During Hitler's blitzkrieg, Freudenstein temporarily moved to Cambridge, England, for safety, and then spent several years in Llandudno, North Wales. Meanwhile, his father and brother were sent to exile in Australia by the British government which regarded all adult male German citizens as enemy of the state. In 1942, when he was 16 years old, Ferdinand with his mother and two sisters sailed from England to Trinidad where they remained for six weeks before moving permanently to the United States. Education Arriving in New York City in 1942, Freudenstein enrolled in New York University, studying two years before joining the US Army. After the army, he used the financial assistance granted by the GI Bill to study at Harvard University, where he earned his M.S. in mechanical engineering in 1948. After receiving his M.S., Freudenstein worked as a development engineer for the American Optical Company in Buffalo, New York. After two years, Freudenstein decided to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Columbia University under the supervision of H. Dean Baker. Career In 1954, Freudenstein was appointed as the associate professor of mechanical engineering in Columbia. Then in 1958, he was promoted to the chair of the university's Department of Mechanical Engineering and then full-ranking professor in 1959. Under his leadership, Columbia attracted numerous academics including mathematician Oenne Bottema and British mathematician Eric Primrose. In 1985, Freudenstein became Columbia's Higgins Professor of Mechanical Engineering, a position which he held until his death. While working as a faculty at Columbia, Freudenstein also consulted for Bell Telephone Laboratories, IBM, and General Motors. His many consultations were later made into open publications. As a professor, Freudenstein had over 500 Ph.D. students including current Stanford professor of mechanical engineering Bernard Roth, engineer George Sandor, and Texas A&M; professor Norris Stubbs. Norris Stubbs is a former Olympian from the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City where he ran for the Bahamas. His teaching became so influential across the world that a Freudenstein Academic Treehttp://my.fit.edu/~pierrel/ff.html was created in his honor. Freudenstein's prominence in the field of kinematics of mechanisms inspired the publication of Modern Kinematics: Developments in the Last Forty Years, written during the celebration of his 65th birthday.A. G. Erdman (Editor), 1993, Modern Kinematics: Developments in the last 40 years, Wiley-Interscience. Awards and recognition Freudenstein was elected member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1979.http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/2C9AE917A8B0173B86257552006B31E1?opendocument National Academy of Engineering Archive He is an honorary fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a Guggenheim Fellow and a recipient of the Egleston Medal conferred by Columbia University.

In 1995, he started to work at the Texas A&M; University in College Station, Texas, where he is a professor of mathematics.Curriculum vitae Works Erd√©lyi started his career studying Markov and Bernstein inequalities for constrained polynomials in the late eighties. In his Ph.D. dissertation he extended many important polynomial inequalities to generalized polynomials by writing the generalized degree in place of the ordinary. His trigonometric work on Remez inequality represents one of his most cited papers. In 1995, he finished his Springer-Verlag graduate text Polynomials and Polynomial Inequalities, co-authored with Peter Borwein, and including an appendix proving the irrationality of Œ∂(2) and Œ∂(3). Later that year he showed that M√ºntz's theorem holds on every compact subset of the positive real axis of the Lebesgue measure. His bounded Remez-type inequality for M√ºntz polynomials in the non-dense case also allowed him to resolve Newman's product problem. In the same year he also proved a Bernstein's inequality for exponential sums, the subject of an earlier conjecture by G.G. Lorentz. Erd√©lyi has also published papers dealing with other important inequalities for exponential sums and linear combinations of shifted Gaussians. Early in the twenty-first century he proved two of Saffari's conjectures, the phase problem and the near orthogonality conjecture. In 2007, working with Borwein, Ferguson, and Lockhart, he settled Littlewood's Problem 22. He is an expert on ultraflat and flat sequences of unimodular polynomials, having published papers on the location of zeros for polynomials with constrained coefficients, and on orthogonal polynomials. He has also made significant contributions to the integer Chebyshev problem, worked with Harvey Friedman on recursion theory, and, together with Borwein, disproved a conjecture made by the Chudnovsky brothers. Erd√©lyi's more recent work has focused on problems in the interface of harmonic analysis and number theory, and the Mahler measure of constrained polynomials. In 2013 he proved that the Mahler measure and the maximum norm of the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials on the unit circle have the same size. He contributed substantially to Chowla's cosine problem by proving Bourgain and Ruzsa type results for the maximum and minimum of Littlewood cosine polynomials. One of his Bernstein type inequalities for rational functions is now referred to as the Borwein‚ÄìErd√©lyi inequality. He is also known for establishing the full M√ºntz theorem with Borwein and Johnson, and has some partial results related to questions raised by Paul Erd≈ës. In 2017 he proved Saffari's longstanding conjecture stating that the Mahler measure of the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials of degree n is asymptotically (2n/e)^{1/2}.

Bulacan is a province in the Philippines in Luzon island and its residents are called Bulaque√±os, also spelled as Bulakenyos (Bulakenyo for men and Bulakenya for women) in the Filipino language. It is a \\"serene portrait\\", of a Filipino woman wearing a Mar√≠a Clara gown, a traditional Filipino dress that is composed of four pieces, namely the camisa, the saya (long skirt), the pa√±uelo (neck cover), and the tapis (knee-length overskirt). The name of the dress is an eponym to Mar√≠a Clara, the mestiza heroine of Filipino hero Jos√© Rizal's novel Noli Me Tangere.Moreno, Jos√© \\"Pitoy\\". Costume at the Fin de Siecle - Maria Clara, Philippine Costume, koleksyon.com The woman's clothing in the painting is the reason why the masterpiece is alternately referred to as Mar√≠a Clara. It is one of the few canvases done by Luna illustrating Filipino culture. The painting is displayed at the National Museum of Fine Arts. Identity of the woman Filipino art experts, historians, and researchers have four recommendations on the identity of the woman depicted in Luna's La Bulaque√±a despite the absence of photographs. According to E.A. Cruz, a columnist for the Philippine Daily Globe newspaper, the woman in the portrait could be one of the women courted by Luna after losing his wife Paz Pardo de Tavera. Luna accidentally killed his wife and mother-in-law because of jealousy. The woman could also be a woman courted by Juan Luna's brother, Antonio Luna. Two existing references suggested that it was the daughter of a prominent Filipino family who Luna was not able to marry or, as mentioned earlier, a woman wooed by Luna's brother, Antonio. The two books suggested that the woman was one of the daughters of Do√±a Mariquita Sabas who lived in 2 Espeleta Street, Binondo, Manila, a place frequented by Luna himself and his brother Antonio for tertulia gatherings. Do√±a Sabas had two daughters, namely Dolores nicknamed Loleng and Francisca monickered Paquita. It was Dolores who is believed most likely to be the woman portrayed in Luna's La Bulaque√±a. However, according to Rosalinda Orosa, the owner of Luna's other painting, the Tampuhan, the woman could be Emiliana Trinidad, Orosa's ancestor and the same woman who was the sitter for Luna's Tampuhan painting. According to Dr. Asunci√≥n N. Fernando, the woman could be Mar√≠a \\"Iyang\\" Rodrigo Fernando, Asunci√≥n Fernando's own grandmother who assisted in the cause of the Katipunan. Mar√≠a Rodrigo Fernando was the bringer of food and courier of messages to Katipuneros hiding in the fields outside her hometown. Historian Antonio Valeriano noted that the woman in the portrait has similar facial features of the Rodrigos which include the \\"bushy eyebrows and sad eyes\\" such as that of Francisco \\"Soc\\" Rodrigo. Belen Ponferrada of the Museum of Malaca√±ang conforms with the findings of the research regarding the woman's possible identity.Ocampo, Ambeth.

They are invisible woodland creatures, which can be seen by humans only on rare occasions and are fond of song and dance.  Name  The term shtojzovalle derives from the Albanian words shtoj (English: add), zot (English: god, deity) and valle (English: dance), with the term meaning in English \\"may God give increase to their dance\\" or \\"multiply, God, their choirs\\". The name shtojzovalle is a product of Pagan and Christian religious syncretism. The alternative term shtojzorreshta means \\"may God give increase to their rows\\" in English.  Traits  The shtojzovalles are small male and female creatures of extraordinary beauty. They live in forests and pastures and spend their time singing and dancing. They have the ability to fly and at night they spin the thread of human existence. They are invisible to humans and a human can see them only if they lift an invisible veil in front of their eyes. Occasionally humans and shtojzovalles are married, but a human can keep a shtojzovalle maiden only if he gives her his clothes to wear. If a human builds their house on lands inhabited by shtojzovalles, the house will be haunted by shtojzovalles shaking heavy iron chains.

The club runs a number of rugby union and field hockey teams for both men and women as well as a number of junior programs. History The club was founded in 1971. The idea of forming a rugby football club based on the Irish community in Calgary was conceived by Derrick Wright and Jim Sullivan to name but two. It was decided not to confine the club's activities to rugby, but to promote other amateur sports, to improve and maintain the moral, intellectual, physical and social qualities of its members and to stimulate good citizenship and friendship. The club has been committed to being a premier outdoor athletic club in Calgary ever since 1971, and one of the most successful rugby programs in Western Canada. CCIAC Senior Men Players who have represented Canada at the Rugby World Cup Julian Loveday (1999) Quinten Fyffe (2003) Ryan Smith (2007, 2011) Highlights In 1973 a ladies field hockey section of the club was formed. In 1993 the club was the first rugby club in Calgary to open its own clubhouse and playing fields, complete with 2 full size rugby pitches and 2 field hockey pitches. In 1999 a Women's Rugby team joined the club to form one of the best women's rugby programs in Canada. In 2003 the club became the first rugby club in Calgary to open an indoor gym. In 2011 all three senior men's rugby teams qualified for playoffs. In 2011 the 2nd division team won the provincial championship by beating the Norwesters 16-12.

Generally, such payments are made to a widow whose late spouse has satisfied the country's requirements, including contribution, cohabitation, and length of marriage. United States In the United States, the widow's pension was introduced in the Senate in 1930. It was not especially uncommon for young women in Arkansas to marry Confederate pensioners; in 1937 the state passed a law stating that women who married Civil War veterans would not be eligible for a widow's pension. The law was later changed in 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions.

An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean \\"false\\" or other \\"empty\\" (but defined) values. Depending on circumstances, evaluation to an undefined value may lead to exception or undefined behaviour, but in some programming languages undefined values can occur during a normal, predictable course of program execution. Dynamically typed languages usually treat undefined values explicitly when possible. For instance, Perl has \`undef\` operator which can \\"assign\\" such value to a variable. In other type systems an undefined value can mean an unknown, unpredictable value, or merely a program failure on attempt of its evaluation. Nullable types offer an intermediate approach; see below.  Examples  The value of a partial function is undefined when its argument is out of its domain of definition. This include numerous arithmetical cases such as division by zero, square root or logarithm of a negative number etc.; see NaN. Even some mathematically well-defined expressions like exp(100000) may be undefined in floating point arithmetic because the result is so large that it cannot be represented. If an implementation supports ¬±‚àû, then this value may be computed as +‚àû (\`inf\`), however. An element of an array is undefined when its index is out of bounds, as is the value in an associative array for a key which it does not contain. An argument of a variadic function which was not passed to it, is undefined within the function body. A variable which is not initialized has undefined (or unpredictable) value until it is assigned. Dereferences of null pointers lead to undefined values and usually raise an exception immediately. Any expression of the bottom type is undefined by definition, because that type has no values. The value of a function which loops forever (for example, in the case of failed Œº operator in a partial recursive function) may be seen as undefined too, but is of only theoretical interest because such a function never returns.  Treatment  In Perl language, definedness of an expression can be checked via predicate \`defined(\`expr\`)\`. The use of undefined value in Perl is quite safe, it is equivalent to false in logical context (under \`if\` etc.). In such statically typed languages as C(C++) there is no specific notion of a value undefined at runtime. Arithmetically undefined expressions invoke exceptions and crash the program, if uncaught. Undefined (means, unpredictable) data in C and similar languages may appear in poorly designed programs or as a result of an unexpected fault, and represent a severe danger, particularly pointers to deallocated memory and null pointers to arrays or structures. Even an attempt to read a value, which a garbage pointer refers to, can crash a program.  Undefined value and nullable types  A nullable data type reserves a special \`null\` value for representing undefined value, so the null value becomes a kind of value; note that undefined value generally is not. Unlike languages with dynamic typing, a variable of nullable type (as implemented in C#) must be initialized before it can be used.  Notation  In computability theory, undefinedness of an expression is denoted as expr‚Üë, and definedness as expr‚Üì.

Early life and education Mary Engle Pennington was born in Nashville, Tennessee; her parents were Henry and Sarah Malony Pennington. Shortly after her birth, her parents moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be closer to her mother's Quaker relatives. Her younger sister, Helen, was born in 1878. Mary Pennington demonstrated an early interest in chemistry. She entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1890 and completed the requirements for a B.S. degree in chemistry with minors in botany and zoology in 1892. However, since the University of Pennsylvania did not grant degrees to women at this time, she was given a certificate of proficiency instead of a degree. Pennington received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1895. Her thesis was entitled \\"Derivatives of Columbium and Tantulum.\\" From 1895‚Äì96 she was a university fellow in botany at her Alma Mater. She was a fellow in physiological chemistry at Yale in 1897‚Äì99, where she did research in physiological chemistry with Dr Lafayette Mendel and Dr Russell Chittenden. In 1898 she founded the Philadelphia Clinical Laboratory. In the same year, she accepted a position with the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania as Director of their Clinical Laboratory.She also served as a research worker in the department of hygiene at the University of Pennsylvania from 1898 to 1901, and was a bacteriologist with the Philadelphia Bureau of Health. In her position with the Bureau of Health, she was instrumental in improving sanitation standards for the handling of milk and milk products.Stephan, Karl D., \\"Technologizing the Home: Mary Pennington and the Rise of Domestic Food Refrigeration.\\" Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives. IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 290. Association with the U.S. Department of Agriculture In 1905, Pennington began working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a bacteriological chemist. Her director at the Bureau of Chemistry, Harvey W. Wiley, encouraged her to apply for a position as chief of the newly created Food Research Laboratory, which had been established to enforce the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. She accepted the position in 1907. One of her major accomplishments was the development of standards for the safe processing of chickens raised for human consumption. She also served as head of an investigation of refrigerated boxcar design and served on Herbert Hoover's War Food Administration during World War I.Stephan, 290 Refrigeration engineer and consultant Pennington's involvement with refrigerated boxcar design at the Food Research Laboratory led to an interest in the entire process of transporting and storing perishable food, including both refrigerated transport and home refrigeration. During her time with the laboratory, Pennington and Howard Castner Pierce were awarded a U.S. patent for an all-metal poultry-cooling rack for the cooling and grading of poultry, rabbits, and game. In 1919, Pennington accepted a position with a private firm, American Balsa, which manufactured insulation for refrigeration units. She left the firm in 1922 to start her own consulting business, which she ran until her retirement in 1952. She founded the Household Refrigeration Bureau in 1923 to educate consumers in safe practices in domestic refrigeration. Much of her work in the 1920s was supported by the National Association of Ice Industries (NAII), an association of independent icemakers and distributors who delivered ice to the home for use in iceboxes, before the widespread availability of electric refrigerators. With NAII support, she published pamphlets on home food safety, including The Care of the Child's Food in the Home (1925) and Cold is the Absence of Heat (1927).Stephan, 290. Publications and memberships She contributed to many scientific and medical journals and was a member of the American Chemical Society and the Society of Biological Chemists. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the Philadelphia Pathological Society, Sigma XI, and the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.

Plot During the year Meiji 25 (1892,) Sumi Kitamura is penniless and her brother Eisuke, a womanizer and gambler, constantly leaves them in debt while bringing even more orphaned children home to feed. When her adopted sister, Tomi, becomes ill, Sumi finds that no doctors will help her as they are poor and no one is willing to give her money for medicine to save Tomi. Then as Sumi is crying on the road a handsome man gives her a handkerchief and some money, telling her to stop crying as smiles beckon happiness into her life before disappearing. Later a debt collector turns up at Sumi's house demanding 2000 yen. Eisuke is nowhere to be found and it is revealed that he had been making advances on the debt collector's wife. The man says that he will take away all of Sumi's younger siblings and sell them into slavery. Desperate to save her siblings, Sumi goes to the red light district in an attempt to raise the money in one night. Just when she thinks there's no more hope, a man named Soichiro Ashida appears and says that he will buy her. Sumi goes with him only to find that he was paying her to marry him! They immediately go to the church and afterwards he says that he'll pay for anything she could possibly want, but she has to marry him and not fall for him and that he will never love her. Sumi agrees and they get married. Characters ; :The series' protagonist. At the start of the series, 15-year-old Sumi is living in the lowest levels of poverty until she marries Soichiro. She is an incredibly kind girl, but has a psychological issues with the scent of roses, caused by childhood trauma. Sumi is generally headstrong but rather dense. She is a master of shogi and a good cook as well. She becomes caught between her love for her husband, Soichiro, and Nozomu. It is later revealed that Nozomu is her biological brother, and that her real name is . At the end of the story, Sumi establishes an elementary school that anyone can attend and has a baby girl with Soichiro. ; :Sumi's husband; He marries Sumi to get his inheritance. He is a childhood friend of Nozomu. He can be considered an example of a tsundere character. Soichiro is afraid of fires due to a traumatic event in his childhood, where his parents and younger half-brother died in a fire that destroyed his home. Some believe that it was Soichiro who caused this tragedy, when it was likely his half-brother's doing, as he had been playing with matches earlier that day. Soichiro is quick to assume and can be selfish, but seems to be learning to genuinely care for Sumi. He falls in love with her, even giving up all his money and his company to be with her. Sumi has changed him for a better person. At the end of the story, Soichiro and Sumi have a baby girl. ; :Soichiro's childhood friend. He is very skilled at painting. He falls in love with Sumi, the moment he sees her. But it evolves into an obsession when it's brought to his attention that he can't have her. He even goes as far as kidnapping her. Despite later being married to Miu, a woman of his father's choosing, he asks Sumi to run away with him. He becomes a yandere character as the story progresses. Nozomu is conniving enough to attain the presidencies of both his father's and Soichiro's companies. Later on, he even forces an eviction on Sumi's adopted family, and makes them homeless, in order to make Sumi come to him for help and love him. However, deep down inside, Sumi still has feelings and love for Soichiro, no matter how hard that Nozomu forces on her. Despite finding out that Sumi is his biological sister, he still wanted to marry her. When Soichiro came and stopped the wedding by taking Sumi away, since she loves him the most, Nozomu makes up with Miu and starts loving her. In the end of the story, Nozomu and Miu are off far away from where Sumi is, so Nozomu can try to forget his love for her, as she is his sister, and he and Miu are expecting a baby soon. ; :Soichiro's butler. Komai leaves Soichiro after Soichiro does not believe him during an incident with Keiko. Afraid to face his parents after quitting, Komai lives with Sumi's family, taking care of the young children. Nozomu later hires Komai to be his butler, though Komai appears to still be loyal to Soichiro. In the end of the story, Komai is Soichiro and Sumi's butler again. ; :Sumi's older brother, who has a terrible problem with gambling. Eisuke gets a job at Soichiro's company and manages to pay 10 years worth of the bills towards his landlord. Shown to be extremely handsome, he has a job in which he visits older, richer women. It is revealed that Sumi and Eisuke are not biologically related; he found her in a rose garden as a baby and brought her up as his sister. The reason Eisuke brings home so many abandoned children to Sumi because she once wished for more siblings. In the end of the story, Eisuke is seen holding Soichiro and Sumi's baby daughter in one of his arms. ; :Nozomu's wife from an arranged marriage by their parents. She is devoted to Nozomu but he is unfeeling towards her. She is good friends with Sumi at first. Because she had not know of Sumi and Nozomu's previous relationship, she didn't know about Nozomu's psychotic tendencies either. She tries to get Nozomu to notice her, going so far as to use Sumi's perfume. This causes Nozomu to react physically with Miu for the first time in their arranged marriage. Unfortunately, he whispers Sumi's name, not Miu's. Miu starts to wonder what relationship the two had before her marriage to Nozomu. At a party, Nozomu continues to fawn and look at Sumi lovingly. He praises her saying she was more beautiful than anyone else. Before dancing with her, Nozomu refers to Sumi by her name, which causes Miu to flash back to Nozomu whispering Sumi's name. Miu grabs a bouquet of roses and attacks Sumi, cutting her cheek with the thorns, and cries hysterically. After the attack on Sumi, Miu confronts Nozomu and asks if he is in love with that aforementioned girl, to which Nozomu admits that he is and that he does not feel the same way about her. Miu then finds Nozomu's painting of Sumi, and slashes it with a knife. Later, Miu arrives suddenly at the shogi club and informs everyone that she will be holding a party at her and Nozomu's. During this party, Nozomu unexpectedly announces to all the guests that he and Miu will be divorcing, without consulting with Miu beforehand. Devastated, she yells at Sumi and blames her for all that has happened. She attempts to stab Sumi in rage, but is stopped by Soichiro and Nozomu, and once again cries uncontrollably. She enters a coma-like state and is sent to a summer house for patients with mental health problems. Sumi visits her, begging to know what she must do to atone for her friend's misfortune, and she tells Sumi to jump off a cliff into the ocean. Sumi then does so, because she greatly cares for Miu. It is then implied that her and Sumi's friendship is restored, with Miu understanding that it was always Nozomu who'd been chasing Sumi. In the end of the story, Miu and Nozomu make up, go off far away place in the country, and are expecting a baby soon. ; :Soichiro‚Äôs step-cousin and vice-president of Soichiro's company. He becomes suspicious of Sumi and attempts to find out her true origins. He and Nozomu later team up to have Soichiro removed as company president. It is implied that he had held real feelings for Keiko, but made her doubt him when he tells her he was to be married soon. He was tricked by Nozomu who takes the head position from him. He later return to Sumi's side to aide her for redemption. In the end of the story, he was one of the fellows from Soichiro's company that congratulated Sumi for establishing an elementary school, thus making him nice. ; :Soichiro and Sumi‚Äôs maid. She appears to be loyal and friendly, but is actually working as a spy for Natsuki. It is implied that she and Natsuki had a physical relationship, one she hoped to hold onto even after she went to spy on Soichiro. In the later chapters, she returns to Natsuki's house. There, Natsuki proposes to Keiko but she refuses, saying she was discarded. It was hinted that he did have feelings for her. But after Keiko realizes that all Natsuki wanted was power, she cuts off all ties with him. After her confrontation with Natsuki, she is kinder to Sumi, and stops making advances towards Soichiro. Media =Manga= Written and drawn by Rinko Ueda, the Stepping on Roses manga began serialization in the sh≈çjo manga magazine Margaret in 2007.The series went on hiatus at one point due to the birth of the author's son, after this, the series was only in every other issue of the magazine, making it a monthly series, instead of a bi- monthly series. It was announced that Stepping on Roses would conclude in the February 20, 2012 issue of Margaret, but the chapter was pushed back one issue to the March 19 issue. At their panel at Anime Expo 2009, Viz Media announced they had licensed the series for North America as part of their Shojo Beat imprint. Volume List =Light Novel= The series is also being adapted as a light novel, that runs in Cobalt. Reception Deb Aoki of About.com says of the first volume that while it glosses over its Meiji Era setting's \\"not-so-pretty aspects\\", the approach works for what Ueda is doing. Overall, Aoki seems to like the series, calling it a \\"charming and unapologetically romantic story that will make you smile.\\" Mania.com's Julie Opipari mentions that while the series is like a Harlequin novel, which could be off-putting for some readers, it drew her into the story. She also mentions that occasionally the melodrama is a bit much, but that she \\"can't wait to find out\\" what will happen next. Volume two of the Viz edition of the manga was number 10 on the New York Times manga best-seller list in its first week of release. The third and fourth volumes were ranked number 8 on the same list in their first week of release. The fifth volume of the Viz's English release of the series ranked 6th in its first week of publication.

Relation to Filipino culture In Filipino courtship, culture, values and psychology, tampuhan (from the Filipino-language root word tampo) or sulking is in essence a disagreement between lovers where they do not speak to each other. This is sometimes called \\"the silent treatment\\". Other expressions of sulking in the love life of Filipinos include other non-verbal actions such as not conversing with other people, keeping to one's self, being oddly quiet, non-participation with friends in group activities, non-participation in family outings or other activities, and even merely locking one's self in his or her personal bedroom. To end the sulking, one of the lovers has to coax the other, or both persuade each other to commit to an agreement or compromise.‚ÄúTampuhan‚Äù and ‚Äútampo‚Äù, seasite.niu.edu The setting is also significant to the Philippine culture for the reason that the couples are inside a traditional colonial Filipino house known as Bahay na bato, with its iconic interior, Capiz WIndowpane and Ventanilla, while the woman is wearing the traditional Maria Clara gown of the Filipino women.

It is named after John Tate who first proved it. It shows that the dual of such a Galois module is the Tate twist of usual linear dual. This new dual is called the (local) Tate dual. Local duality combined with Tate's local Euler characteristic formula provide a versatile set of tools for computing the Galois cohomology of local fields. Statement Let K be a non- archimedean local field, let Ks denote a separable closure of K, and let GK = Gal(Ks/K) be the absolute Galois group of K. =Case of finite modules= Denote by Œº the Galois module of all roots of unity in Ks. Given a finite GK- module A of order prime to the characteristic of K, the Tate dual of A is defined as :A^\\\\prime=\\\\mathrm{Hom}(A,\\\\mu) (i.e. it is the Tate twist of the usual dual A‚àó). Let Hi(K, A) denote the group cohomology of GK with coefficients in A. The theorem states that the pairing :H^i(K,A)\\\\times H^{2-i}(K,A^\\\\prime)\\\\rightarrow H^2(K,\\\\mu)=\\\\mathbf{Q}/\\\\mathbf{Z} given by the cup product sets up a duality between Hi(K, A) and H2‚àíi(K, A‚Ä≤) for i = 0, 1, 2. Since GK has cohomological dimension equal to two, the higher cohomology groups vanish. =Case of p-adic representations= Let p be a prime number. Let Qp(1) denote the p-adic cyclotomic character of GK (i.e. the Tate module of Œº). A p-adic representation of GK is a continuous representation :\\\\rho:G_K\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathrm{GL}(V) where V is a finite-dimensional vector space over the p-adic numbers Qp and GL(V) denotes the group of invertible linear maps from V to itself.Some authors use the term p-adic representation to refer to more general Galois modules. The Tate dual of V is defined as :V^\\\\prime=\\\\mathrm{Hom}(V,\\\\mathbf{Q}_p(1)) (i.e. it is the Tate twist of the usual dual V‚àó = Hom(V, Qp)). In this case, Hi(K, V) denotes the continuous group cohomology of GK with coefficients in V. Local Tate duality applied to V says that the cup product induces a pairing :H^i(K,V)\\\\times H^{2-i}(K,V^\\\\prime)\\\\rightarrow H^2(K,\\\\mathbf{Q}_p(1))=\\\\mathbf{Q}_p which is a duality between Hi(K, V) and H2‚àíi(K, V ‚Ä≤) for i = 0, 1, 2.

The council granted planning permission to Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd to redevelop the Chatham Dockyard as a commercial port, noting that this would have some impact on local residents but authorising it because the economic benefit would far outweigh any potential noise problems. The port's activity called for a large number of heavy duty vehicles moving around the clock, and by 1988 there were almost 750 lorries using the port per day. The Borough Council brought an action against the dock company in public nuisance on behalf of its residents, and the case was heard by Buckley J in the High Court of Justice. Buckley, while rejecting the dock company's arguments that only illegal acts could be public nuisances and that the granting of planning permission authorised the nuisance, held that the dock's activities were not a public nuisance. This was because the commercial dock had significantly changed the character of the area, changing the definition of what was and was not unreasonable behaviour. Facts In 1982 the Chatham Dockyard began to close, threatening the economic stability of the Chatham area. In 1983 Gillingham Borough Council authorised the regeneration of the area as a commercial dock, granting planning permission and intending that it operate 24 hours a day.Steele (1993) p.568 The fact that the 24-hour operating period would cause a disturbance in what was essentially a residential area was considered, but it was felt that the economic benefit the dock would produce outweighed this problem. The port went into full operation in 1984, and within 4 years almost 750 lorries were using the roads every day.Mullis (1993) p.307 In 1988, acting under Section 222(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, Gillingham Borough Council brought an action against the dock company on behalf of its residents, arguing that the company was creating a public nuisance against the residents of the area, thanks to the noise of heavy-duty vehicles going through the neighbourhood at night.Ford (1993) p.15 The council sought an injunction limiting the hours in which vehicles could pass, saying it should only be permitted from 7:00am to 7:00pm.Steele (1993) p.569 Judgment The case came before Buckley J in the High Court of Justice, with the dock company arguing that only an illegal act could count as a public nuisance. Buckley rejected this argument, citing Lord Denning's judgment in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd,[1957] 2 QB 169 in which he defined a public nuisance as \\"a nuisance which is so widespread in its range and so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large\\", not mentioning legality of the conduct in question.Ford (1993) p.16 Buckley also cited a large number of cases where a public nuisance prosecution had succeeded despite the nuisance not being a crime at the time, such as R v Wheeler, R v Madden,[1975] 3 All ER 155 and R v Holme.[1984] C.L.Y. 2471Mullis (1993) p.308 Buckley decided both that planning permission did not create a license to cause nuisance and that legal acts could count as a public nuisance. However, he came to the conclusion that no public nuisance had been created, saying that the change in the neighbourhood's character altered what was acceptable there: \\"where planning consent is given for a development or change of use, the question of nuisance will thereafter fall to be decided by reference to a neighbourhood with that development or use and not as it was previously\\".Steele (1993) p.570 In this he drew on Thesiger LJ's judgment in Sturges v Bridgman;[1879] LR 11 Ch D 852 that what would be a nuisance in some areas is not so in others.Bermingham (2008) p.228 His decision was further discussed in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd,[1995] 2 All ER 697 where the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the granting of planning permission would necessarily lead to significant changes to alter the character of an area.Bermingham (2008) p.229 See also *Nuisance in English law *Wheeler v Saunders Ltd References Bibliography  * Category:English tort case law Category:English nuisance cases Category:1992 in case law Category:1992 in the environment Category:1992 in British law Category:High Court of Justice cases ","title":"Gillingham Borough Council v.

The GMAP presents (i) a comprehensive overview of the global malaria landscape, (ii) an evidence-based approach to deliver effective prevention and treatment to all people at risk and (iii) an estimate of the annual funding needs to achieve the goals of the RBM Partnership for 2010, 2015 and beyond. The targets of the GMAP are to: * Achieve universal coverage, as recently called for by the UN Secretary- General),Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon addresses a high-level interactive panel to launch the Global Malaria Action Plan for all populations at risk with locally appropriate interventions for prevention and case management by 2010 and sustain universal coverage until local field research suggests that coverage can gradually be targeted to high risk areas and seasons only, without risk of a generalized resurgence; * Reduce global malaria cases from 2000 levels by 50% in 2010 and by 75% in 2015;* * Reduce global malaria deaths from 2000 levels by 50% in 2010 and to near zero preventable deaths in 2015; * Eliminate malaria in 8-10 countries by 2015 and afterwards in all countries in the pre-elimination phase today; and * In the long term, eradicate malaria world-wide by reducing the global incidence to zero through progressive elimination in countries. To achieve these targets, the GMAP outlines a three- part global strategy: # control malaria to reduce the current burden and sustain control as long as necessary, # eliminate malaria over time country by country and # research new tools and approaches to support global control and elimination efforts.

Topography  The lake is situated in an altitude of 1725 m, an egg-shaped form stretching itself along a north‚Äìsouth axis in the valley of Gaube. This steep-sided valley is located at the foot of the Vignemale (3298M). The lake is surrounded by the peak Mayouret (2688 m) to the east, the big Peak of the Paloum√®res (2720 m) to the southeast, and the peak of Gaube (2377 m) to the northwest.  Hydrography  Its principal inflows are the Gaube River tributaries (Gave des oulettes de Gaube), which take their name from the Gave de Gaube, which is the principal outflow of the lake. The lake has an average depth of 40m, surface area of 19 hectares, and more than 2 km of shoreline. A delta situated at the mouth of the principal outflow of the lake is loaded with glacial alluvial deposits.

Service Zmaj appears to have been little used in her intended role; only her salvage of an upside-down Dornier Wal in the Bay of Kotor in 1936 has been confirmed. This may be why she was converted to a minelayer the following year. Following her conversion she made port visits to Piraeus and Istanbul, accompanied by the destroyer and the submarines and .

Shortly before the German invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 Zmaj laid defensive minefields along the Dalmatian Coast and off the main ports. These minefields may have caused the loss of the Yugoslav passenger ships SS Karaƒëorƒëe and SS Prestolonaslednik Petar off Zlarin. Zmaj was captured in Split by the Germans on 17 April. Renamed as Drache (Dragon) by the Germans she was initially used in support of Luftwaffe seaplane units, but was redesignated as an aircraft rescue ship () on 7 August 1941. Her armament was increased by two and one anti-aircraft guns as well as racks for a dozen depth charges. She was transferred on 27 December to the Aegean and reclassified as a troop transport. Drache was modified at Trieste between April and August 1942 for service as a minelayer. Her existing armament was replaced by two , five and six 2 cm AA guns. She was equipped with four mine rails on her after deck that could accommodate up to 120 mines and another 120 mines could be carried internally. Her crane was replaced by two derricks and the lattice mainmast was plated over and resembled a funnel. A platform was built behind the funnel above the main deck. A Fl 282 being tested by the Americans after the war Drache was recommissioned on 20 August 1942 and she was renamed Schiff 50 on 6 November. She conducted a number of minelaying operations in the Aegean as well as some of the west coast of Greece. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943 she was used to carry troops to reconquer the island of Kos on 2‚Äì3 October (Operation Eisb√§r). On 8 October she was unsuccessfully attacked by the British submarine although her companion, the , was sunk. Draches most successful operation was a mine barrage laid just east of the islands of Pserimos and Kalymnos to protect German troops during the Battle of Leros. The British destroyer and the , carrying supplies and reinforcements for the British forces on Leros, ran into this minefield on the evening of 22 October. Adrias had her bow blown off and Hurworth was sunk attempting to come to the aid of Adrias.Freivogel, pp. 53‚Äì54 Adrias, however, was eventually able to make it back to Alexandria. Two nights later the destroyer encountered the same minefield while carrying reinforcements to Leros. She hit a mine, broke in two, and sank in five minutes.Rohwer, p. 281 Drache was also used for shipboard trials with the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) helicopter. She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January‚ÄìFebruary 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take- off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather. Drache under attack by Beaufighters on 22 September 1944 in Vathy The ship was attacked by Allied aircraft several times in 1943 and early 1944, but she was only lightly damaged on two occasions. Nonetheless her anti-aircraft armament was augmented during 1944. One quadruple 2 cm Flakvierling 38 mount was installed on each side of the bridge and she carried a total of thirteen 2 cm guns. Her 10.5 cm guns were exchanged for lighter guns to compensate for the increased top weight. However this proved to be insufficient to save Drache when she was attacked by several British Bristol Beaufighters of No. 252 Squadron RAF on the afternoon of 22 September 1944 while anchored in Vathy harbor on the Greek island of Samos. She was set on fire, exploded and sank two hours later; eleven of her crew, including the commander Joachim W√ºnning, died during the attack. She was scrapped in place after the end of the war.

The painting presently owned by the Government Service Insurance System is currently exhibited at the National Museum of Fine Arts after the state pension fund transferred management of its collection to the National Museum in March 2012. Measuring 57 cm √ó 79 cm (22 in √ó 31 in),‚ÄúParisian Life‚Äù by Juan Luna, christies.com The Parisian Life is one of the masterpieces that Luna created when he stayed in Paris, France from October 1884 to February 1893. His own personal ‚ÄúParisian life‚Äù was a total of eight years. This period in Luna's career in painting is known as the post-academic or the Parisian period, a time when his style moved away from having ‚Äúdark colors of the academic palette‚Äù and became ‚Äúincreasingly lighter in color and mood‚Äù. As an artist, Luna became renowned on the European continent and became ‚Äúa familiar of the French and Spanish royal courts‚Äù. During the period, apart from his heightening artistry Luna was also participating in the Philippine propaganda movement together with Jos√© Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines. Months after painting The Parisian Life, Luna would be departing from Paris to Madrid, Spain then to Manila, Philippines in 1894 in order to rejoin Rizal and Dr. Ariston Bautista Lin, and perform his role in the Philippine Revolution and war of independence in 1896. During this time, Luna also had to deal with the death of an infant daughter and the alleged extra-marital affair of his wife Paz Pardo de Tavera with a French physician. Because of jealousy, Luna killed his wife and his mother-in-law. Luna also attempted to kill his brother-in-law. A French court charged Luna for committing a \\"crime of passion\\"Ellorin, Bencyrus. Juan Luna and Our Heritage , sunstar.com, October 12, 2003 but was acquitted of parricide and murder on February 7, 1893. The Parisian Life is regarded as the last major work Luna did during his post- academic and life in Paris because from 1894 Luna travelled frequently that he was only able to paint a few number of landscapes in the Philippines. When Luna returned to France in 1898, he was an appointed member of the delegation in Paris representing the Philippine revolutionary government tasked to work for the diplomatic recognition of the Philippines as an independent Republic. In 1899, Luna died in Hong Kong while on the way back to the Philippines. Description Painted a few months prior to September 1892, a time when Luna would be ‚Äúcaught up in dramatic events‚Äù that lead to a ‚Äúheroic path‚Äù, The Parisian Life has a ‚Äúplayful‚Äù and ‚Äúrelaxed mood‚Äù that does not provide ‚Äúthe slightest hint of the tumultuous happenings to come‚Äù in Luna's personal life. It portrayed a scene inside a caf√© in Paris with a woman identified as a courtesan or a prostitute representing \\"fallen womanhood\\", who was about to rise from a sofaFlores, Patrick D. Juan Luna's Parisian Life and the Production of Property, A Piece of History, Department of Art Studies, University of the Philippines, docs.google.com overshadowing three men placed at the far left corner of the painting. Apart from the prominent figure of the female wearing a pale lavender frock and a hat embellished with flowers, fronted by two glasses of beers and an empty beer mug belying a \\"company of men\\", The Parisian Life portrayed a glimpse of Luna's own life in the capital of France while accompanied by two close friends. The painted illustration captured the gathering of three significant personas and heroes in Philippine History having a discussion about the Philippines ‚Äúon the eve of momentous events‚Äù during the springtime in Paris. The three gentlemen dressed in European garb ‚Äì top hats and coats ‚Äì at the left of the image are Luna himself, Jos√© Rizal, and Ariston Bautista Lin, who were on an ‚Äúexpedition‚Äù during a casual evening in a caf√© believed to be named as Maxim‚Äôs, brimming with self-confidence while enjoying a moment inside the caf√©. They were described as Filipino gentlemen who ‚Äúembraced Western lifestyle while remaining (...) Filipino at heart.‚Äù In the painting Rizal was with a half- turned back, Luna was at the center seated in a cheerful mood, and Lin was sitting closest to the lady in the portrait and characterized to be the person with the ‚Äúmost vivid expression‚Äù among the three gentlemen throwing an inquisitive glance toward the woman. The evident intimate mood of the painting was further enhanced by Luna by placing the details of the deserted hat and cape, the pulled-out chair, and the coat on the sofa. According to Eric Zerrudo, the director of the Museum of the Government Service Insurance System during a lecture at a week-long SM Mall exhibit, the woman in The Parisian Life has a \\"geographical likeness\\" to the mirror-image of the archipelago of the Philippines. Furthermore, Zerrudo mentioned that the woman has a dark neck, the woman was placed with her head in a window joint resulting to having the effect of a sort of \\"antenna jutting out\\" of the head. The dark neck and the window joint line showed that as if the woman was being strangled, conveying the message that the Philippines was under stress. As a cultural and historical artwork, The Parisian Life does not solely embody the ‚Äúintangible ideas of the Filipino national consciousness‚Äù but also Luna's talent as an artist. The Parisian Life painting proves that Luna is an ‚Äúindefatigable painter of women‚Äù. It also proves that Luna was an ‚Äúenthusiastic observer of the fairer sex‚Äù, an artist who had a ‚Äúkeen eye‚Äù for the ‚Äúelusive psychology‚Äù of women, and a painter with an ‚Äúobviously sensitive insight into‚Äù women's fragility, strength, happiness, and solemnity. The Parisian Life further proved that Luna was sensitive and skillful in capturing a fleeting moment of ordinary life that he could imbue with ‚Äúpersonality and universal emotions‚Äù. Documentation and exhibition The original owner of the painting was Ariston Bautista Lin and his family. Before its modern-day exhibition at Christie's auction house in Hong Kong, The Parisian Life was featured on page 147 of Santiago Albano Pilar's book entitled Juan Luna, The Filipino as Painter published in 1980. Pilar's book was published by the Eugenio Lopez Foundation. Pilar reproduced the copy of the painting from the Luis Araneta collection. After Luna completed The Parisian Life it was exhibited only once for public viewing, an exhibition held in 1904 at the World's Fair‚Äôs Saint Louis Exposition in the United States, where it won as a silver medalist. Apart from being accompanied by a Saint Louis Exposition certificate, Christie‚Äôs Hong Kong gave it an estimated price tag of HK$1,800,000 - HK$2,000,000, an equivalent of $231,921 - $257,690. Despite this price estimate, the GSIS Museum, a Philippine-government owned and controlled corporation, bought the painting from Christie's Hong Kong in October 2002 for the price of $870,000 (P 45.4 to 46 millionJuan Luna's 'Parisian Life' comes to UST, Vol. LXXV, No. 8, The Varsitarian, The Official Publication of the University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines, January 15, 2004, varsitarian.net\\"The Parisian Life\\" by Juan Luna , inquirer.net).

It is a member of the Athena family of rockets, along with the larger Athena II. The Athena I is a three-stage rocket, consisting of solid first and second stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fuelled third stage. The first stage is a Castor 120, which is also used on some versions of the Taurus rocket. An Orbus 21D motor was used as the second stage on launches up to 2001. If the rocket returns to service as Athena Ic, the Castor 30 would be used instead, which was developed for the Antares rocket (originally called Taurus II). The third stage is an Orbital Adjustment Module, fuelled by hydrazine and propelled by four MR-107 engines, which is used for final insertion. Prior to its retirement in 2001, Athena I launches were made from Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Launch Complex 46 at Spaceport Florida, and Pad 1 of the Kodiak Launch Complex. Future Athena Ic flights could use the pads at Kodiak or Canaveral, with Launch Pad 0B of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport also on offer. If a launch from Vandenberg is ordered, Space Launch Complex 8 would be used instead of SLC-6, which was rebuilt as a Delta IV launch complex following the Athena's initial retirement. Four Athena I launches have been conducted, with one failure. Its maiden flight was conducted from SLC-6 at Vandenberg, and lifted off at 22:30 UTC on 15 August 1995. It was intended to place GemStar-1 into orbit, however the rocket was destroyed by the range safety officer after the failure of its thrust vectoring system resulted in a loss of control. The launch was the first from SLC-6, which had originally been built for the Titan III rocket for launches of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, and was later rebuilt for polar orbit Space Shuttle launches. Both MOL and polar Shuttle flights were cancelled before any launches were made from SLC-6. The next Athena I launch was on 23 August 1997, and successfully placed the Lewis satellite into orbit for NASA. This launch also took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg. The third Athena I launch was from LC-46 at Spaceport Florida, and took place on 27 January 1999. The payload, ROCSAT-1, was the first satellite to be operated by the Republic of China. The fourth launch, which was conducted on 30 September 2001, was the first orbital launch to be made from Kodiak Island. Known as the Kodiak Star mission, it successfully placed the Starshine 3, Picosat 9, PCSat and Sapphire satellites into orbit.

With scenery and costumes designed by William Chappell, it was first presented by the Vic-Wells Ballet at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, on 16 February 1937.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books,1981). It has been called \\"a paradigm of an Ashton ballet, perfectly crafted with a complex structure beneath the effervescent surface.\\"Julie Kavanaugh, Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton (London: Faber & Faber, 1996), pp. 197‚Äì98. Synopsis The ballet, in one act, depicts a Victorian skating party that takes place on a frozen pond on a winter's evening. A semicircle of arched trellises painted white separates the pond from the snowy woods behind. Suspended above are colourful Chinese lanterns, shedding light on the white canvas stage covering, simulating ice, and dimly illuminating the dark trees silhouetted against the starry night sky. The first skaters to enter are four couples dressed in matching brown jackets. They are soon joined by others: two girls wearing blue jackets and bonnets, two girls wearing red jackets and bonnets, a girl and boy dressed all in white, and a lone boy wearing blue. This happy group of young people dance together in various combinations, gliding and leaping and spinning across the ice until snow begins to fall and the single boy is finally left alone, whirling like a top in the middle of the pond. Original cast With a cast of only fifteen, Les Patineurs is a ballet in divertissement form rather than a story ballet: the dances simply proceed in sequence from beginning to end, with no narrative development. At the premiere, the principal dancers, the White Couple, were Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann. The Blue Girls were Mary Honer and Elizabeth Miller; the Red Girls were June Brae and Pamela May; and Harold Turner was the Blue Boy, the virtuoso soloist in the group. The Brown Girls were Gwenyth Matthews, Joy Newton, Peggy Mellus, and Wenda Horsburgh, who were partnered by Richard Ellis, Leslie Edwards, Michael Somes, and Paul Raymond as the Brown Boys.David Vaughan, Frederick Ashton and His Ballets, revised edition (London: Dance Books, 1999), p. 485. Divertissements The sequence of the divertissements, which takes about twenty-five minutes to perform, is as follows: entr√©e and pas de huit (Brown Couples), pas de patineurs (Blue Girls and Brown Couples), pas seul (Blue Boy), pas de deux (White Couple), ensemble, de suite par groupe (entire cast), pas de trois (Blue Boy and Blue Girls), pas de deux filles (Red Girls), pas de six (Brown Boys and Red Girls), pas de deux filles (Blue Girls), and finale (entire cast). Despite the presence of Fonteyn and Helpmann in the romantic pas de deux for the White Couple, the true star of the ballet was Harold Turner as the Blue Boy. Ashton's main aim in creating Les Patineurs was to create a dazzling showpiece that would rival the popularity of works presented in London by Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes the previous summer. In Turner, he had an unusually gifted dancer, and he took full advantage of his technical prowess. The Blue Boy is an exceptionally difficult role to perform, and the Blue Girls hardly less so. Further, the Brown Boys are given choreography more usually performed by soloists than members of the corps de ballet, as their bounding, buoyant dances require considerable elevation and stamina. History The inspiration for the work came from Constant Lambert, who was music director of the Vic-Wells Ballet during the 1930s and who exercised a major influence on the artistic as well as musical direction of the company.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Lambert, Constant,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 285. During his research, he chanced upon an old program for an 1849 ballet by Paul Taglioni entitled Les Plaisirs de l'Hiver, ou, Les Patineurs, which gave him the idea for a new skating ballet. To create the score he chose vocal and dance numbers from two Meyerbeer operas, Le proph√®te and L'√âtoile du Nord, and linked them into an irresistibly cheerful score which begins with the waltz which opens Act 2 of L'√âtoile du Nord. Ninette de Valois was originally intended to be the choreographer, but Frederick Ashton heard Lambert playing the score on a piano and asked if he could take it on. He knew little about ice skating, but one of his dancers, Elizabeth Miller, did, and she demonstrated some movements and tricks for him. Transforming them into balletic vocabulary, he set out to create a ballet that would reveal the virtuosity of the burgeoning English ballet and win the public's approval.Kavanaugh, Secret Muses (1996), p. 198. He succeeded beyond his highest hopes. After a triumphant premiere, Les Patineurs was performed in London every season from 1937 to 1968 (except 1960), in succession by the Vic-Wells Ballet, the Sadler's Wells Ballet, and the Royal Ballet. Touring companies performed it in many British cities from the 1950s to the 1980s. By 2011, it had been performed more than 350 times at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, alone. Productions have also been mounted in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, and Turkey. The production mounted for American Ballet Theatre in 1946 had new scenery and costumes designed by Cecil Beaton, which were universally considered an unfortunate departure from Chappell's original d√©cor. Recordings Les Patineurs was one of the first ballets ever to be televised. The transmission by the BBC on 3 May 1937 from Alexandra Palace was not, however, recorded and preserved. Audio recordings of the score were made by Constant Lambert with the Sadler's Wells Orchestra in 1939 and later by many other conductors, including Jean Martinon, Charles Mackerras, Eugene Ormandy, Antal Dor√°ti, Robert Irving, and Hugo Rignold. None of these well- known recordings is commercially available today. In December 2010, a video recording was made of a performance by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and issued on DVD by Opus Arte in 2011. Paul Murphy conducts the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, and the cast includes Steven McRae, Sarah Lamb, Rupert Pennefather, Laura Morera, Samantha Raine, Ryoichi Hirano, Liam Scarlett and Andrej Uspenski.

He was decorated for unselfish acts during a cholera outbreak in Sicily. Biography The early life of Amatore is mostly unknown. The name of Michele Amatore was not given when he was born (probably) in the Nuba mountains of the Sudan.Bakhita Kwashe (Sr. Fortunata Quasce) , Dr. Terence Walz, Research Fellow, American University in Cairo, Dictionary of African Christian Biography, accessed March 2010. Later he came to be known as Sulayman al-Nubi. Much later in his life, Amatore said that he remembered that his father's name was Bolingia and that his name was Quetto. He recounted that he had been captured when Egyptian slave traders raided their family's village. They killed many old people and took away mostly women and children. Those captured were marched without food to Khartoum where a slave market was still acceptable.Quetto Black Slave, digilander.libero.it, (in Italian) (translation ), accessed March 2010 Amatore first came to notice when he was bought as a slave by Dr. Luigi Castagnone when he was about six years old. This doctor was the physician employed by Mohammed Ali Pasha and it was he who devised the name of Michele Amatore.A biographical dictionary of the Sudan, Richard Hill, Richard Leslie Hill, p.54, 1967, accessed March 2010 In Castagnone's employ, Amatore received a basic education and became a Christian. Eventually he left for Italy, accompanied by a friend of the doctor. Italy Amatore established himself in Italy and took on Italian nationality. He enrolled as a soldier and marksman in the specialised Bersaglieri regiment of the Piedmontese army in 1848, when Amatore would have been about eighteen. In 1848 and 1849 he and his regiment from northwest Italy were involved in a campaign against Austria during the first unrest that led to Italian unification. Ten years later he was again involved in a campaign against Austria; 1859 also saw him promoted to corporal. By 1863 he had attained the rank of captain.

The expedition was an early example of blue-water operations and the power projection of the Soviet Union through its Navy's nuclear-powered submarine fleet, and it paved the way for future operations during the latter half of the Cold War. The Soviet expedition took place nearly six years after the first complete submerged circumnavigation of the world undertaken by the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered submarine in 1960. Technically speaking, this Soviet submerged circumnavigation was not a true \\"circumnavigation\\" since the submarine detachment went from the Soviet's Northern Fleet in the area of the Kola Peninsula to the Pacific Fleet base in Kamchatka going around South America and consequently did not go completely around the world as did the USS Triton. Background The Soviet Union took the significantly different approach for the development of its nuclear submarine program from the route undertook by the United States for their submarine program. While the first generation U.S. Navy's nuclear submarines were experimental vessels that could carry out operational missions, the Soviet Navy opted for the immediate series production for its ballistic missile submarine introducing the Hotel, Echo, and November classes (NATO names), that featured the vertical launching system platform which were known collectively as the HEN classes.Polmar and Moore. Cold War Submarines, pp. 76‚Äì78, 82, 84. While more capable in many respects than early U.S. nuclear submarines, early Soviet nuclear submarines also experienced significant problems with their reactor plants, and remedial action was required to correct these technical deficiencies.Polmar and Moore. Cold War Submarines. pp. 112‚Äì113. Consequently, the Soviet Navy could not deploy any nuclear- powered submarines in support of Operation Anadyr, the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missile build-up in Cuba which caused the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.Polmar and Moore. Cold War Submarines. p. 79. Operational summary The first submerged circumnavigation by a detachment (Russian: –æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥; otryad) of submarines was undertaken by two submarines under the overall command of Rear Admiral Anatoliy Ivanovich Sorokin. The detachment departed from the Red Banner Northern Fleet on 1 February 1966. Planning for the mission was credited to Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, then the commander of a Northern Fleet division of submarines and later to become Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy.. The detachment's sailing orders from the Main Naval Staff read in part: alt=Graphic depicting a submarine with a rounded bow, cylindrical hull that tapers to a fin-like rudder, a conning tower near the bow that tapers backward and has nine radio masts and periscopes, and two propeller shafts near its stern. alt=Graphic depicting a submarine with a blunt squared-off bow, a wide cylindrical hull that end in a blunt stern and rudder, a low conning tower that has nine radio masts and periscopes, and two propeller shafts near its stern. > You will be passing through seas and oceans where Russian sailors have not > traveled in more than 100 years. We firmly believe that you will > successfully surmount all difficulties and carry the Soviet Navy Flag with > honor through three oceans and many seas. The detachment consisted of the Project 627 (November class) attack submarine K-133 under the command of Captain 2nd Rank V.T. Vinogradov and the Project 675 (Echo II class) cruise missile submarine K-116 under the command of Captain 2nd Rank L.N. Stolyarov, with K-116 serving as the detachment's flagship. The oceanographic salvage ship Polyus escorted the submarines during their transit. The detachment crossed the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean via the Drake Passage which, according to Academian A.M. Chepurov, was the most dangerous phase of the voyage. Concerns included icebergs and collisions with whales. The ships' personnel participated in line-crossing ceremonies when the detachment crossed the Equator. They also celebrated the landing of the Soviet space probe Venera 3 on the surface of the planet Venus. The detachment completed its circumnavigation by arriving at the Pacific Fleet submarine base in Vilyuchinsk on 26 March 1966, having covered in 52 days. The detachment reportedly encountered numerous U.S. naval vessels during its around the world voyage, but successfully avoided detection. Aftermath The circumnavigation served an immediate political purpose because the mission was dedicated to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The voyage provided a showcase for the capabilities of the Soviet Navy's nuclear submarine fleet as well as the professionalism of its personnel. Approximately one-third of the detachment personnel were members of Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the rest were Komsomol members. Scientific studies were carried out during the voyage. Shipboard systems, tactical coordination, communications, and training were also carried out under a variety of climatic conditions. The timing of circumnavigation's completion coincided with discussions regarding the upcoming Five-Year Defense Plan. Minister of Defense Rodion Malinovsky addressed the 23rd Congress on 2 April 1966: > In recent years, the number of long cruises by our nuclear submarines have > increased by 5-fold and they have clearly demonstrated the capability of our > glorious sailors to successfully carry out any mission in the ocean expanses > from the Arctic to Antarctic. Several days ago an around-the-world cruise by > a group of nuclear submarines traveling submerged was successfully > concluded. The announcement was reportedly \\"greeted with stormy applause.\\" Admiral Sorokin was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union from Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. K-133 commander Vinogradov, chief engineer S.P. Samsonov, and three other participants were awarded the titles of Heroes of the Soviet Union. The New York Times reported the voyage in the following UPI dispatch dated 8 April 1966: > A squadron of nuclear-powered Soviet missile submarines kept a close watch > on American planes and ships encountered during a recent around-the-world > voyage, Krasnaya Zvezda said today. An officer who made the six-week tour as > a special correspondent reported in the Defense Ministry newspaper that > American planes and ships were detected several times. \\"Every time the > necessary measures were taken on board the atomic submarines,\\" he said. On > one occasion, when his submarine rose to periscope depth, he said, a United > States plane was sighted and \\"we dived lower so as not to whet the appetites > of the antisubmarine forces of the imperialists.\\" \\"Of course, we had nothing > to be afraid of,\\" he added. \\"We crossed the seas and oceans strictly > observing the international rules of navigation\\" (fee required) The unnamed naval officer cited in the above article was undoubtedly Captain 2nd Rank G.A. Savichek. Legacy While this submerged circumnavigation by a group of submarines received little notice outside of Soviet naval circles, Soviet nuclear submarine operations took on an increasingly blue-water orientation. In 1968, a November-class submarine successfully tracked a carrier task group led by the nuclear aircraft carrier much to the surprise of U.S. naval intelligence. Also, the Soviet Navy deployed its first true nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, the Yankee class, which began its first nuclear deterrence patrol in June 1969.Polmar and Moore. Cold War Submarines. p. 171. Project 667A (Yankee class) submarine A detachment of two nuclear submarines, one of them a ballistic missile submarine, subsequently undertook a second around-the-world voyage, departing from the Barents Sea on January 5, 1976, and following a route similar to the one taken in 1966. The detachment commander, Captain 1st Rank Valentin Y. Sokolov, was personally selected by Admiral Sergey Gorshkov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, to command this detachment. This strategic deterrence patrol included operations in the North Atlantic. During its transit of the South Pacific, the detachment discovered a previously unknown ocean current. The detachment transferred to the Kamchatka Flotilla of the Soviet Pacific Fleet after 70 days at sea.. For the Soviet Navy itself, its blue-water aspirations culminated in OKEAN, a 1970 worldwide naval exercise. This feat was replicated with OKEAN 75, a three-week follow-up held in April‚ÄìMay 1975. Soviet Defense Minister Andrey Grechko declared: > The Okean maneuvers were evidence of the increased naval might of our > socialist state, an index of the fact our Navy has become so great and > strong that it is capable of executing mission in defense of our state > interests over the broad expanses of the World Oceans. The impact of this Soviet naval expansion was summarized by Admiral of the Fleet Sir Peter Hill-Norton, RN, the chairman of NATOs military staff committee, who observed: \\"The U.S. had never previously faced a global threat to its sea-lane communications from a mix of subsurface, surface and maritime- air naval forces. This is a strategic change of kind, not of degree.\\" See also * Operation Sandblast * Operation Sea Orbit * First Russian circumnavigation Notes Bibliography   * External links  Category:Soviet Navy Category:History of the Soviet Union Category:Military history of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War military history of the Soviet Union Category:Science and technology in the Soviet Union Category:Circumnavigations Category:Non-combat military operations involving the Soviet Union Soviet Submarine Global Circumnavigation, 1966 Submarine global circumnavigation Category:Expeditions from the Soviet Union Category:February 1966 events Category:March 1966 events ","title":"1966 Soviet submarine global circumnavigation"},{"id":"26712903","text":"Al Ahli Stadium may refer to: * Hamad bin Khalifa Stadium, also known as Al Ahli SC Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Doha, Qatar * Al Ahli Stadium (Bahrain), a multi-use stadium in Manama, Bahrain ","title":"Al Ahli Stadium"},{"id":"26712914","title":"Channel Island Snooker Championship"},{"id":"26712933","text":"Sri Nakhon Lamduan Stadium () is a football stadium bearing the traditional name of the city of Sisaket in Thailand.

He was promoted captain on 26 July 1899. He was appointed adjutant of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 23 April 1900, and held that position until 23 April 1905, and returned to regimental duties on 6 May. From this point much of his service was in South Africa,R. W. (1949) \\"Obituary: Matthew William Kemble Connolly, 1872-1947\\". Proceedings of the Malacological Society 28: 2. He was promoted major on 9 July 1910. While in South Africa, Connolly took an interest in minerals and then started observing snails in the field. He took up malacology and conchology seriously and became an authority on the land and freshwater molluscs of South Africa. On 11 December 1912, he went onto the half-pay list as a result of ill-health arising from rheumatic fever. He retired from the army on 2 May 1914. During World War I he was employed at the army record office. He became a friend of Edgar Albert Smith, who was keeper of molluscs at the British Museum and who recognised his worth. In 1918, Connolly became an honorary scientific worker in the natural history department at South Kensington (now the Natural History Museum) and continued to work there until December 1946 in spite of increasing lameness. Connolly published some fifty papers on molluscs between 1910 and 1945. He was a member of the Malacological Society from 1908 to 1938 and was president of the Conchological Society in 1930. Connolly was also a connoisseur of wine and an expert on potted meats and wrote a highly regarded pamphlet on the subject.

The first team, in 1939, was known as the Jamestown Jaguars, a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate, but it folded after only one year. On July 13, 1940 the Niagara Falls Rainbows moved to Jamestown and became the Jamestown Falcons. Jamestown Falcons The Falcons played from 1939‚Äì1957. They played in the PONY League from 1940 to 1956, and in the New York‚ÄìPenn League in 1957. They were affiliated with the Detroit Tigers from 1941 to 1942 and from 1944 to 1956. In 1943, they were affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals. They were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1957. The team reformed in 1961 after a 3-year absence. They were called the Jamestown Tigers from 1961‚Äì1965, the Jamestown Dodgers in 1966 and the Jamestown Braves in 1967 (reflecting their affiliations with the Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves respectively) before returning to the Falcons name from 1968‚Äì1972.

From 1941 onward, they played their home games at Jamestown Municipal Stadium, now known as Russell Dietrick Park.Digital Ballparks Montreal Expos affiliate The team was known as the Jamestown Expos from 1977 to 1993, although Jamestown was affiliated with Montreal in 1970 and 1971, at the time the team was called the Falcons. Major League pitcher Randy Johnson began his career with the Expos in 1985. In 1990, the television show Candid Camera planned to do a segment of minor league baseball. After consulting the front office in Montreal, Candid Camera came to Jamestown to do a prank on pitcher Bob Baxter. Only the visiting team manager, the catcher for the Expos and the other umpires knew about the prank. Host Peter Funt played as the umpire, as the catcher gave fake signals to pitcher Baxter. The Expos were relocated to Vermont after the 1993 season, eventually becoming the Vermont Lake Monsters. However, the New York‚ÄìPenn League maintained a presence in Jamestown, immediately relocating the Niagara Falls Rapids to Jamestown in 1994 and naming that team the Jamestown Jammers. The Jammers would last in Jamestown until the end of the 2014 season, at which point the New York‚ÄìPenn League left Jamestown permanently.

Plot  Norman Sterns and Leela Sterns are newlyweds who are driving from their home in New York City to Los Angeles. They become lost and run out of gas, stranding them in the rural Ozark countryside. They meet a friendly paleontologist named Wayne Thomas. Wayne suggests that they visit the nearest farm that could provide gas. The farm is run by a strange man named Greely, who tells them that the gasoline truck was supposed to arrive the previous day, but since it didn't, he expects it there any minute. Greely suggests that they go inside to the parlor, where it's cooler. On the way up to the house, he asks if they know anybody out here, in case they may be waiting for them. They say no, and when they get inside, Greely goes off to tell his \\"housekeeper\\", Bella to make some iced tea. She argues with him on what he will \\"do with them\\", but Greely smacks her, and threatens that she will \\"take their place\\" if she doesn't serve them some tea. Thomas arrives and Greely goes outside. He tells them that their car won't start. Wayne decides to take a look at the engine and tells Greely to go back to his truck and get a tool. Greely instead beats him on the back of the head with it and drags his body off. Meanwhile, Leela appears to be worried about Greely, because he is acting strange and his eyes don't look right. She then compares his eyes to a stuffed lizard across the room. Greely comes back inside and tells them that he had to do a chore. Leela wants to go back outside, but Greely tells them that they could check out his \\"collection\\" while waiting for the truck. He takes them out to the yard and shows them his \\"zoo\\", which includes ordinary animals like turtles, rattlesnakes, coyotes and a bobcat. Greely then tells them that they should have a look at his \\"prize\\", which is located deep in a mountain cave system behind his home. He puts them in a small room which he claims he had set up for tourists while he goes to turn on the rest of the power. However, it was a trap, as Greely pulls a lever and drops some bars down, blocking their way out. Greely leaves the cave, laughing as Leela discovers that Thomas is inside the cell as well, badly wounded but alive. He tells them that Greely threw him into another cavern below them, and left him there, but he found a way out and crawled in the cell, right as they arrived. Norman suggests that there may be a way out down there, and begins a descent into the cavern. A reluctant Wayne and Leela follow and discover a prehistoric, aquatic dinosaur coming out of a spring, which Greely apparently feeds live victims to. Greely catches them in the enclosure and points a pistol at them, attempting to force them down in there to be eaten. Greely shoots Wayne in the abdomen, but Wayne throws an object at Greely and hits his gun hand, causing the pistol to fall into the enclosure. Norman urges Leela to go for the gun, but Greely tells him that it won't do him any good, and leaves. Norman rushes down and gets the pistol, but suddenly the monster appears out of the water as Leela and Wayne warn him. Norman fires the gun at the creature, but it has no effect, and it kills him before he gets the chance to escape. Bella arrives and reveals that she is not Greely's housekeeper; he kidnapped her and abused her until her will was broken and she agreed to do whatever he told her to do to avoid being fed to the creature. Wayne convinces Bella to help them. Wayne remembers that he has some dynamite in his car, and he asks Bella to sneak upstairs and bring back some of it. Greely becomes suspicious of Bella, and he drugs the coffee that she brings to the prisoners. Leela and Wayne are overcome by the drug, but not before Wayne hides the dynamite. When Wayne comes to, he retrieves it, but Greely intervenes and threatens to feed Leela to the creature if she will not willingly become his new servant. Bella, having heard that he plans to dispose of her, goes down there. Greely recovers his pistol, but Wayne overcomes Greely and knocks him unconscious. Bella ignites the dynamite and explains to Greely that she plans to blow up the cave to kill both the dinosaur and Greely. Greely grabs his pistol and kills her, right as the monster is about to kill Greely. The dynamite explodes, collapsing the cavern and burying the dinosaur and Greely. Wayne and Leela escape in Wayne's car to an unknown future.

The film revolves around the story of a girl who arrives in Shanghai to devote her talents to athletics and is almost led astray by college boys but is put back on track by her male coach and comes to understand the idea of ‚Äútrue sportsmanship (‰ΩìËÇ≤ÁúüÁ≤æÁ•û)‚Äù. One of the best auteurs of 1930s Shanghai cinema, the director Sun Yu made a series of films featuring the refreshing image of ‚Äúbonny girls‚Äù, which not only entertained the audiences at that time but more importantly, advocated the spirit of ‚Äúsports saving the nation‚Äù in the social and political context of 1930s China.  Cast  *Li Lili as Lin Ying, the high-spirited heroine. *Zhang Yi as Yunpeng, Lin Ying‚Äôs mentor and coach, who trains the school‚Äôs athletes ‚Äúto save the nation through tiyu (athletics).\\" *Wang Moqiu as Ai Zheng *Yin Xu as Yunyan *Bai Lu as Xiao Qiuhua *Han Lan'gen as Xiaomao *He Feiguang as Hu Shaoyuan *Liu Jiqun as Lin Ying's Unclehttps://baike.baidu.com/item/‰ΩìËÇ≤ÁöáÂêé/3360507  Plot  The story begins with Lin Ying (Li Lili), a high-spirited daughter of a wealthy rural family, who comes to Shanghai with her father. She is initially set up with a suitor but after displaying athleticism she goes to attend a special school for female athletes, who compete to bear the title of the ‚ÄúQueen of Sports.\\" Inspired by the noble conviction that China will become a stronger country if all the people were to strengthen their own bodies, Lin Ying works hard to become an outstanding sprinter. However, she becomes spoiled by success and becomes arrogant and neglectful of her studies. She begins to associate herself with westernized college boys who spend their time drinking, smoking and dancing. After being rescued by her dedicated coach, Gao Yunpeng (Zhang Yi), she vows to change her ways and continues to work hard. By the end of the film, however, following the death of a classmate from a gruelling race and overexertion, Lin Ying decides that the pursuit of the individual glory is wrong. She is no longer interested in being hailed as the ‚ÄúQueen of Sports‚Äù and resolves to serve others as a regular teacher of physical education.  Production  = Origins = In the early 1930s, China was in danger from Japanese militarism as well as economic depression. During this time, Sun Yu was a producer, director, screenwriter and actor for the Lianhua Film Production and Printing Company, a studio established by the producers Luo Mingyou (1901‚Äì1967) and Li Minwei (1893‚Äì1953). The studio was made under the auspices of the top-tiered politicians, ideologues and financiers of the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) for the purpose of making educational films that would promulgate the Party's socio-political values, which are understood as being 'right-wing.' The KMT invested a lot of money into the making of educational films (both documentary and fiction) for political purposes, which gave birth to the film Queen of Sports. Sun Yu began shooting the film on November 26, 1933. = Themes and Inspirations = Due to the dangers of Japanese militarism and the economic depression that hit China in the early 1930s, many people involved in the film industry called for the revolution and revitalization of national films, including director Sun Yu. Inspired by the country's call for revitalizing national films, Sun Yu produced the film with the idea of a 'fit woman's body' to match the popular propaganda of \\"Fitness helps to save the Nation.\\" Throughout the 1930s, Chinese film making was also strongly influenced by the perceived Hollywood's melodramatic cinematic style, which was characterized by scandal, sexual promiscuity, drug addictions and more. Despite filmmakers' claims of attempts to warn the audience about an alien spiritual pollution, foreign cultural modes were still often displayed in an alluring way and attracted more audiences than repelled. Sun Yu was one of the first leftist filmmakers who attempted to explore the idea of spiritual pollution with Queen of Sports in 1934, which was also produced under the political influence of Xia Yan‚Äôs small Communist film group in Shanghai. The Kuomintang‚Äôs right wing started the ‚ÄúNew Life Movement‚Äù in February 1934. This movie also agreed to some extent with the New Life Movement. For example, the film took two minutes focusing on personal hygiene issues: Lin Ying and her teammates get up in the morning and do gymnastics on their canvas beds before brushing their teeth; the close up shot here features Lin Ying‚Äôs action, followed by two school maintenance workers washing their faces and brushing their teeth. This sequence be understood as the film's standpoint to the New Life Sports Hygiene Regulations: \\"Go to bed early and get up early, keep your face and hands clean. Be sure to brush your teeth and keep your hair clean.\\" The film's narrative consists of a strong sense of community and societal expectations over a single individual. To further advance China's image to the rest of the world's perception with a more positive one, and contributing to national development, Sun Yu believed that emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the individual would build the nation as a whole. = Casting = One of the goals of Queen of Sports was to display Li‚Äôs athletic ability. This film also embedded her presence as ‚Äúan athletic movie star,\\" especially as it highlighted her proficiency in running, a part of the male- dominated sport of track and field. Fan magazines confirmed Li‚Äôs athletic skills outside of the film screen with photos of her in sports attire, posing with her school basketball team or alone on a running track. While there were other ‚Äúactresses visiting sports games,‚Äù Li was respected and admired as an ‚Äúathlete‚Äù herself..  Critical Reception  = True Sportsmanship = Li Daoxin, the professor of Peking University, had a speech on CCTV and uses Queen of Sports to talk about true sportsmanship (lit. the spirit of sports). Queen of Sports obviously entrusts Sun Yu's reflection on the concept of \\"sports to save the country\\". This reflection is first manifested in the film's inscription: \\"Dedicated to the Soldiers Who Work for the True Spirit of Sports\\". Under the inspiration of \\"True Sportsmanship\\", the heroine Lin Ying gave up her victory and the title of \\"Queen of Sports\\". Sun Yu interpreted \\"True Sportsmanship\\" as the collective progress of the nation and the necessary personal sacrifice for the overall benefit of the society. When he teaches his female students, Yunpeng claims, \\"True sportsmanship is the need for balanced improvements of every single person‚Äôs physique, the need to spread [this value] among society...it is definitely not to create individual heros!\\", expressing that the replacement of individual competitive success with the widespread popularization of sports is the definition of the so- called ‚Äútrue sportsmanship.‚Äù In her last moments, Xiao Qiuhua said to Lin Ying, \\"Though I am an athlete, I do not possess true sportsmanship, because physical exercise should be for strengthening the body, for us to be more healthy and lead happier lives, but instead I placed too much importance in reputation and thus it has lead to consequences today.\\" Thus according to scholar Zhao Zijian, Director Sun Yu intended to impart the message that the most important part of sports should not be victory or defeat, but the participation and the process of doing so. This didactic message about the need to harness the individual body ‚Äì in particular, the female body ‚Äì for nation building is not to be missed. It focuses on the collective, that feature of subsequent Chinese sports films. = The Athletic New Woman = Li Lili‚Äôs persona as a patriotic modern youth in Queen of Sports is profoundly different from that of a fallen woman which Ruan Lingyu represents in her popular films such as Goddess and New Women. In Queen of Sports, Li‚Äôs distinctively female physicality shown in the camera‚Äôs focus on her body greatly departs from the clich√©d image of the fallen woman that Ruan typically exhibits in her masterpieces, who usually uses cosmetics and even self- commodification to enhance her sexual appeal. This shift indicates an identification of ‚Äúmodern culture of fashion and consumption‚Äù as well as the conflict of traditional Chinese values and contemporary fashionable femininity. Victor Fan, drawing from the work of Hansen and Laura Mulvey, claims that the film centres on the playfulness (a resistance against being viewed seriously) of Lin Ying and emphasizes her athletic curiosity, making the athletic female body a \\"scopophilic fetish\\". Fan argues that the sexual attraction between Yun and Lin was captured through the shot-reverse-shot sequences. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the female protagonist is enrolled in a school focused on physical education, as she runs around actively outdoors while also taking classes and practicing music indoors, exploring the values of sportsmanship. This image on screen stands in stark contrast to the traditional Chinese view of a woman who should have bound feet (three-inch golden lotus) and stay indoors at all times. China at the time still maintained many conservative values, such as that women should stay within the bedroom instead of being out and about, yet this film was unconventional in that it subverted these traditions and presented to viewers women of a new era. Thus the understanding and definition of women experienced enormous change under the guidance of film culture. Despite the portrayal of active women, out of approximately thirty title cards throughout the film, communication between Lin Ying and Yun Peng take up about 20 of them, through which a clear logic is conveyed: women require the teaching and leadership from a man -- the sports queen has a gift for sports but is psychologically like a baby who needs protection and guidance.  In Popular Culture  The name ‚Äúqueen of sports‚Äù became a sought after title to its audiences, and advocated athletics as a significant part of womanhood. Few scholars focused on the effect of sports and athletics on creating modern Chinese women. However, Queen of Sports sparked discourse in female physical health with the film‚Äôs presence in Chinese media and popular culture. Tiyu huanghou: modeng mingge xuan (Queen of sports: selections of modern popular songs) was a music booklet named after the film. It consisted of music and lyrics of the most popular songs of the time. The first song in the booklet was also called Queen of Sports, though not part of the film. The cartoon magazine Modern Sketch used images inspired by the film in their publications, such as pictures of ‚ÄúLi crouching at the starting line and running among a group of strong and tough girls.\\" These images of female athletes became popular with college and middle school students, depicting the film as popular within this age group and giving it a certain degree of social influence. Li Lili even drew cartoons herself, collaborating with cartoonists such as Shao Xunmei, Ye Lingfeng, and Ye Qianyu. In Modern Sketch‚Äôs article Shidai xiaojie de jianglai (The Future of the ladies of the age), Ye Qianyu drew a cartoon portrait of the actress titled ‚ÄúSweet Girl Li Lili‚Äù to promote the actress‚Äôs sweet disposition. Written by Xu Xingqin, the article was published on April 15, 1934. This image is also seen in Lili‚Äôs 2001 memoir, which she published only for the eyes of her friends and family. The popular photography pictorial Liangyou Huabao also used similar sporty images of Li from Queen of Sports to support the film‚Äôs message of tiyu (physical education). The caption read: \\"The Goal of Tiyu : competition supports tiyu, but the ultimate goal of tiyu is definitely not competition. In athletic competition, the winners do not have to be overjoyed, and the losers do not have to cry, because they are both actors who perform in front of the masses to show them that physical health is the true meaning of tiyu. We do not need a so- called 'queen of sports.' What we need are healthy citizens, even though they may finish last in athletic competitions. Every athlete should firmly remember: the ultimate goal of tiyu is to cultivate healthy bodies in order to contribute to the greatest work for the happiness of mankind, not a gold spear or a silk banner.\\" DVD release Queen of Sports was released in the United States on Region 0 DVD on May 8, 2007 by Cinema Epoch.

The level was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto to be a tutorial for new players, orienting them to platform jumping and to the rest of the game. World 1-1 is one of the most iconic video game levels and has been widely imitated and parodied. Design =Design philosophy= During the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials which explain the mechanics of a video game were rare, and players instead were oriented to a new video game by its level design. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by forcing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. In an interview with Eurogamer, Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything a player needs to \\"gradually and naturally understand what they‚Äôre doing\\", so that they can quickly understand how the game works. According to Miyamoto, once the player understands the mechanics of the game, the player will be able to play more freely and it becomes \\"their game\\". =Execution= Schematic of the start of World 1-1. The Goomba (red) walks toward Mario and must be jumped over. The Mushroom (light green) appears after bumping into the golden block from below, and initially rolls to the right, until it falls off the platform and bounces against the pipe (green). The Mushroom then turns around and rolls toward Mario, who can easily receive it at this point. At the start of World 1-1, the player‚Äîtaking control of Mario‚Äîcomes across a Goomba slowly approaching. According to 1UP.com, it is likely that this first enemy will kill a new player, even though the enemy can easily be avoided by jumping over it. As very little progress is lost, the player learns from defeat and can try again. Past this Goomba comes an arrangement of blocks, a few of which are colored in gold. By bumping one of the gold-colored blocks from below, a coin pops out. According to Miyamoto, seeing a coin come out will \\"make [the player] happy\\" and want to repeat the action. Doing so for the second gold- colored block makes a Mushroom come out; a power-up, unbeknownst to the player. The player has learnt from the Goomba that just defeated them that mushroom-shaped beings are bad, so naturally the player tries to jump over the mushroom in order to avoid it, however the blocks are arranged in such a manner that a player attempting to dodge the mushroom immediately hits and is deflected by the block downwards onto the mushroom, which lands the player onto the power-up. Being touched by the Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, another positive reinforcement. After this block formation comes a series of four vertical warp pipe obstacles that must be jumped over. Each has a different height, subtly teaching the player that the longer they hold the jump button, the higher their jump goes. When encountering variously-sized pits, the player may discover how to use the button for running, because running makes a bigger jump across the pits. Furthermore, Miyamoto ensured that some pits have floors and can be simply jumped out of instead of forcing the player to retry the entire level. World 1-1 includes a few secrets‚Äîsuch as a warp pipe that leads to a bonus room and a hidden block that contains a 1-up‚Äîthat players can discover by replaying. The warp pipe also allows a player to skip a large portion of the stage, so that more experienced players can advance more quickly in repeat replays of the game. Reception World 1-1 has been cited as one of the most iconic video game levels, with Chris Kerr of Gamasutra describing it as \\"legendary\\". Boston Blake of Game Rant rated World 1-1 among the best opening levels in video games as a level that \\"ignited a love for gaming in the hearts of gamers around the world\\", and Jon Irwin of Paste Magazine described the level as a \\"master-class in teaching players how to play\\". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com stated that \\"much of the game's success arose from the fact that it equipped players with the tools to master it from the very beginning.\\" Almost all mechanics introduced later in the game are variations of what the player learns in World 1-1, and the first levels of later games in the series (such as Super Mario Bros. 3) also expand upon the mechanics introduced in World 1-1. Parish described the stage as \\"the most widely imitated, referenced, and parodied single level of a video game\\". =Legacy= The design philosophy introduced in Super Mario Bros., described as \\"learning through play\\", has been implemented in all video games Miyamoto has worked on since. World 1-1 greatly influenced later Super Mario games, such as Super Mario 3D Worlds first level. Variations of World 1-1 are frequently recreated by fans in the Super Mario Maker series. Examples include an extra difficult version where dozens of twirling fire bars are added to the level, a version in which the level needs to be climbed vertically, and version of World 1-1 that plays itself automatically.

It is Turner's final painting of Rome and had been in the possession of the family of the 5th Earl of Rosebery since 1878, until the painting came to auction, 7 July 2010. It was bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and was subject to an export bar to allow a British gallery time to attempt to match the Getty's bid. Background Modern Rome ‚Äì Campo Vaccino is a landscape vision of the unexcavated Roman Forum, still called the Campo Vaccino, the \\"Cow Pasture\\", shimmering in hazy light and is the last of Turner's twenty-year series of views of the city. It was painted at the peak of Turner's career from studies and sketches made on two visits to the city. It was completed in 1839. Features of Classical, Renaissance and Baroque Rome occupy the canvas, but the foreground contains indicators of modern life, including goatherds. It was first purchased by Hugh Munro, a friend and patron of Turner, from a Royal Academy exhibition in 1839. The painting was purchased for 4,450 guineas by the 5th Earl of Rosebery and his wife, Hannah Rothschild on their honeymoon in 1878. It was hung in the family's country home, Mentmore Towers and in their London residences for a century. In 1978, the painting, which had remained in the family, was loaned to the National Gallery of Scotland. 2010 auction In March 2010, it was announced that the painting would come to auction on 7 July 2010. Sotheby's auction house said the painting was being sold by a descendant of the 5th Earl of Rosebery to help secure the future of family estates. The painting had been estimated to fetch ¬£18 million. It went on view in Sotheby's New York auction house from 29 April to 14 May, before returning to London for the auction. The painting, which is in immaculate condition, has been described by Sotheby's as \\"undoubtedly among the most important of Turner's works ever to come to auction\\". It was announced that if the work is sold to a collector who wishes to take it out of Britain, they would have to apply for an export license as part of the national cultural heritage. A temporary export ban would then be put in place to allow the National Galleries of Scotland time to raise equivalent money to save the painting for a public collection, though this would not happen if it was sold to a private collector in the UK. On 7 July 2010, the painting was sold at auction for ¬£29.7 million, which broke the artist's auction record. The painting sold in five minutes and was purchased in the room by the dealer, Hazlitt Gooden and Fox who were acting on behalf of the Getty Museum. The price became the highest paid for a Turner work up to that date ‚Äì this was later beaten by Rome, From Mount Aventine in December 2014, which sold for ¬£30.3m. The United Kingdom's Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest stated the painting was of \\"outstanding aesthetic importance\\" and recommended putting the export bar in place. Culture minister Ed Vaizey accepted this recommendation and put the bar in place on 3 November 2010 to last until 2 February 2011, with a possible extension to 2 August 2011. The bar initially saw little attention in the British press, though one writer for The Daily Telegraph opposed it. References External links *Modern Rome ‚Äì Campo Vaccino, J.

The episode's teleplay was written by Seth Hoffman, Marc Guggenheim and was directed by John Polson. Originally aired in the United States on ABC on March 18, 2010, along with the second half of the episode, Revelation Zero (Part 2). Plot =The Day of the Blackout= A man named Timothy, a window washer in L.A., is about to go down a window washing elevator from the roof of a tall office building when the blackout happens. He accidentally hits the lever down as he falls down, but his weight makes the elevator tip off to the side causing him to slide off the elevator. As he falls, his hook, which is in the hands of his unconscious partner, slips out of his hands and starts slipping off the building until it hooks back onto the elevator, saving Timothy from falling to his death. =The Present= Mark and Demetri return from Hong Kong, and Wedeck starts interrogating Mark about the events that happened, while Janis and Vreede interrogate Olivia, who's recently witnessed the abduction of Lloyd Simcoe at the hospital by two EMTs' who go over the names of Wheeler and Quarny. Meanwhile, Wedeck tells Mark that he'll be doing some therapy with psychiatrist, Callie Langer, until she can determine whether or not if Mark's stable to come back after his three weeks of suspension. Just as Mark's about to leave, he quickly takes photos of everything on his board before he leaves, and then bumps into Simon, who's watching the security footage from the hospital. Mark watches a little bit of it, showing Quarny slapping Olivia across the face. Olivia and Mark rejoice, but the reconcile is ruined when Mark sees Olivia hugging Lloyd on the footage. Mark ignores it and the couple head on home. Later, Wedeck takes Demetri into the meeting room, where Marshall Vogel, an agent of the CIA, is waiting there, who Demetri met back in Hong Kong when Mark tried to abduct a lady who had information on Demetri's death in the future. Turns out, he's now joined the \\"Mosaic Task Force\\". Simon is in the room with them, because he's known Lloyd Simcoe since they started on the \\"Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Project\\", which is believed to be the cause of the blackout. Simon believes that if they check Lloyd's laptop to see if he's talked with anyone on there, they could possibly find a lead on where to find him. Simon and Janis head over to Lloyd's house to check it out, when Janis and Simon get attacked by two masked men, the same men who Mark claimed to have seen in his vision. They knock out Janis while they kidnap Simon. The next day, they trace all the 911 Emergency calls, and one of them was called from a train station. Demetri and Marshall go check it out, and find the bodies of the real ambulance drivers in one of the abandoned train compartments. After identifying the dead bodies, they decide to trace one of the guys cell phones, believing it could help them find the ambulance vehicle, which would lead them to where Lloyd and possibly Simon are at. =Interrogation= Lloyd wakes up, recently after he's been abducted, in a basement where he is greeted by Lucas Hellinger, who unlocks his handcuffs and gives him some water, and tells him that if he answers some questions, his boss will let him go, which Lloyd doesn't agree to do. The next day, Lloyd wakes up when he hears his abductors throw someone down the stairs, who turns out to be Simon. Lloyd finds a menu to the \\"Crown Cheese Steak\\" in the basement, and with the blood from his wounds, writes \\"HELP US\\" on it, and holds it outside the window so someone could see it, but it gets blown away. They're then confronted by Flosso (who was previously seen in The Gift where he killed a guy for not bringing back all seven rings of some sort). Flosso asks Lloyd how many electron volts were generated during their experiment. Lloyd doesn't give him the answer because he doesn't want him to cause another blackout. Flosso explains to Lloyd that he and Simon didn't cause the blackout, but their experiment amplified it. Flosso then returns with Lloyd's \\"Help Us\\" sign and has Quarny and Wheeler take Simon away to be tortured. When they return, Flosso gives Lloyd another chance, and when he refuses, Flosso has Quarny cut off Simon's pinky. =Mark and Olivia= Mark goes to his first session with Callie Langer, and after revealing to her that he was drunk in his vision, she says that there's a drug that she gives to patients that can enhance some parts of people's visions that they can't remember. She gives it to Mark, and he dreams of something from his vision. He sees more stuff, such as Lloyd's Crown Cheese Steak \\"Help Us\\" Menu, and a \\"Red Panda\\" Logo. Then, he was talking with Lloyd Simcoe on a cellphone, possibly both of them working with each other, Lloyd talking about getting close to cracking up a Q.E.D., and Mark basing their work from the tellings of \\"D. Gibbons\\", who Lloyd tells Mark that he's always been a liar. Mark tells Lloyd that unless they can stop what they're trying to prevent, there's gonna be another blackout. Mark tells his best friend, Aaron Stark, about what he saw and returns to tell Wedeck what he saw. Wedeck tells him to keep his mouth shut about it, otherwise they'll look bad. Mark then goes to question Red Panda Industries, an industry where they provide help (education, water, food, etc.) around the world, including Somalia. Meanwhile, Olivia tries to stop the hospital chief Mr. Dunkirk about not transferring Dylan, Lloyd's son, away. Olivia then checks up on Dylan and cheers him up, telling the chief that he could be sick. That night, Dylan gives Olivia a cookie from his dinner and she sings him good night. =Sanctuary= Nicole's mother, who is mentally ill, tries to burn the bible, but Nicole puts the fire out before she can kill herself. Nicole leaves her mother with her sister Paige, and goes to the hospital, where she sees a staff member who she believes to be the man who kills her in her vision. She tries to stop him, but he disappears. She tells Olivia, Bryce and another nurse about it, and Olivia promises that she'll alert security. The nurse, who knows that Nicole is worried and scared, tells her to go to a meeting called \\"Sanctuary\\", where a man explains to people how the flashforwards were a good thing. Nicole goes to the meeting, where it turns out that the speaker is Timothy, the window washer seen at the beginning of the episode. After the meeting, Nicole asks him about their rules to God, since she believes He caused the blackout. Timothy then tells her that if she would like to discuss it, they should meet the next morning for some coffee. Nicole agrees to do so.

It was also known as South Cape Airport, South Point Air Force Station, or Ka Lae Military Reservation. It is now abandoned. History The facility was located at Ka Lae, the southernmost point on the island of Hawaii and consisted of of land owned in fee simple plus utility easements covering of land. =Morse Field= In 1941 construction was underway on five buildings, runways, and access roads at Morse Field. Activities were centralized at this airport inasmuch as its location shortened by approximately , from a routing through Oahu, the transpacific air ferry route to Australia and the Philippines. Construction work, originally under the Zone Constructing Quartermaster, was transferred to the District Engineer in late 1940. A total of $1,534,793 was requested from the War Department in May for completion of the project; this amount later increased to $2,020,000. The work on runways at Morse Field was suspended shortly after the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Hawaii, and all adjacent landing areas demolished and the strip destroyed as a precautionary measure against enemy use. By 28 December 1941, gasoline storage facilities were complete, a water line installed, and mobilization buildings were more than half finished. These projects were all that were deemed appropriate for continuance at the time. Blocking of landing areas on the island occupied large amounts of time and manpower due to the extensive areas involved and the comparatively smooth surfaces surrounding the field, which could be used as landing fields. After World War II it was declared surplus and on January 16, 1948, a right of entry from the U.S. Army to the Territory of Hawaii was approved. It was not until August 30, 1952 that the property was finally restored to the Territory by Executive Order. =South Point Air Force Station= In December 1964, General Bernard A. Schriever of the AFSC announced that the Air Force would assume control of space tracking and communications from the Navy at South Point on 1 February 1965. Then on 30 September 1965, the Station was closed. It was later reopened, however, in support of Project Have Lent, a sounding rocket probe program to evaluate advanced ballistic reentry system experiments. The close proximity and aspect angle of South Point to the optical site sensors located on the island of Maui were the primary reasons for launching the probes from this location. In 1979, the Station was divided in two parcels located about apart, containing approximately each. One of the sites was the main operations area, while the other areas was used for a boresight tower. The Station was under the operational control of the Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC). South Point AFS was one of the few Air Force installations in the State of Hawaii that did not fall under the control of the 15th Air Base Wing at Hickam AFB. It belonged to the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), with headquarters at Andrews AFB. Final closing On February 11, 1983, the facilities at the former Morse Field were formally closed by the governor's executive order.

Ahern's use of Bertiespeak has been credited as playing an integral part in the Northern Ireland peace process and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair was noted on at least one occasion to have allowed Ahern to use Bertiespeak when confronted with a tricky question posed by a journalist. On another occasion when Unionists on a visit to Government Buildings in Dublin made a complaint Ahern was said to have \\"drowned\\" them \\"in a torrent of Bertie-speak\\", according to Deagl√°n De Br√©ad√∫n. References to Bertiespeak appeared regularly in the Irish media during Ahern's administration. Will Hanafin's De Little Book of Bertie, published in 2001, features numerous examples of Bertiespeak. Description Bertiespeak has been described by witnesses as being constructed of sentences which are \\"coherent and logical\\" when taken individually but are \\"calculated to bemuse and mystify\\" when said consecutively, with one observer remarking: \\"You would want to be Einstein to understand it\\". Pat Leahy, writing in The Sunday Business Post in 2002, suggested in relation to Ahern's speech, \\"one is seldom in doubt about what he means, but there is sometimes confusion over just what he is actually saying\\" before citing one example from a press conference during which Ahern said \\"neutrality is not and never has been anything but absolutely clear\\". The Sunday Times book reviewer Edward King described Bertiespeak as being \\"characterised by a combination of malapropisms, grammatical infelicities and general confusion\\" and said the following was the most famous example of Bertiespeak: Examples of use One example of Bertie-speak noticed by the Irish media (Sunday Tribune) occurred in 2003 while Ahern was addressing D√°il √âireann and referred to \\"the road map\\", the European Union's Middle East peace plan, as \\"the road crash\\" on several occasions. Another famous example is his call for people not to \\"upset the apple tart\\". Political opponents too have recognised Bertiespeak. Then Labour Party TD Derek McDowell, speaking at the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 19 April 2000, is recorded as having registered his confusion at some of Ahern's points: Speaking of media opposition to his Stadium Ireland proposal in 2002, Ahern complained: \\"I‚Äôll not have it whinged to death in the press\\".Irish Times Letters, 26 May 2011 Book De Little Book of Bertie, written by Will Hanafin and published by Merlin Publishing in October 2001, was the first book dedicated to Bertiespeak. As part of his research Hanafin browsed newspapers and watched television programmes which featured Ahern.

Situated between the northwest and west-central part of Cherokee County, Georgia, it is the highest point in the county at . It is also the highest point in the extended metro Atlanta area, which lies to the south and southeast, while Lake Arrowhead lies to the east- southeast at the foot of the mountain. Just to the west runs the Bartow/Cherokee county line. For media in Atlanta, there are two broadcast stations on the mountain. The TV tower is that of 1000-kilowatt WPXA-TV 31 (14.x), also the site of its former analog TV transmission. Its city of license is Rome, Georgia, two counties to the west, but it is considered part of the Atlanta media market for purposes of must-carry regulations. Because it is so far out of town, and in a different direction for most people, reception of the station is often difficult, especially due to the digital TV format mandated by the FCC. The only other major TV station in northwest Georgia is WNGH-TV 33 (18.x), located much further north. For FM broadcasting, W213BV on 90.5 (W214AS on 90.7) was a 10-watt broadcast translator for Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls, one of hundreds relaying KAWZ, in this case licensed to serve Waleska. The tower was also the first site for WCHK-FM 105.5, originally a simulcast of WCHK AM 1290, both licensed to serve Canton, Georgia (the county seat). That station changed frequency to 105.7, and after having another tower along Interstate 575, is now WBZY to the southeast on Sweat Mountain. However, the table of allotments still lists Bear Mountain for the station's reservation.

The convicted man, Gary Dotson, was released and later exonerated in the first celebrated case involving DNA evidence.  Allegation  In 1977, Webb, then known as Cathleen Crowell, was a 16-year-old resident of Homewood, Illinois, living with her foster parents. On July 9, on her way home from her part-time job at a Long John Silver's fast food restaurant, she claimed to have been abducted by three men in a car, one of whom raped her. Later, after contacting police, she identified a suspect from a composite sketch and a mug shot. Gary Dotson was soon arrested as a suspect after matching her description. In a 1979 trial, her testimony, along with scientific evidence by a forensic serology expert (later found to have fraudulent credentials), was used to convict Dotson, who was then sentenced to a 25-to 50-year prison term for kidnapping and rape.  Recantation  In 1985, Webb was married and living in Jaffrey, New Hampshire. She became active in the Baptist church. After confessing to her pastor, she decided to come forward with the truth. Securing a lawyer, she contacted the Cook County State Attorney's office. In her testimony, she admitted to fabricating the charges in 1977 to cover up a possible pregnancy after having consensual sex with her boyfriend. She claimed to have panicked at the thought of being thrown out of her foster parents' house. Webb's recantation was dismissed at first by state prosecutors and the Cook County District Attorney's office. When her lawyer, John McLario, contacted the Chicago Tribune and WLS-TV the news media focused on the story and there was intense local interest, with sympathy solidly on Webb and Dotson's side. In a hearing held at the Markham Branch Court on April 4, Dotson was released on bond. At a hearing on April 11, however, Judge Richard L. Samuels, faced with confusing evidence, revoked the bond and ordered Dotson back to prison. McLario and Webb then took their case to the national media. News editors found Webb a photogenic subject, and she attracted nationwide attention after a cover story on the April 21 edition of People magazine. The media frenzy drew in Illinois Governor James R. Thompson. Unable to ignore the publicity and apparent political pressure, Thompson personally presided over clemency hearings on May 10. The hearings were televised live at the State of Illinois Center in Chicago. After three days Thompson commuted Dotson's sentence. Following the hearings, Webb and Dotson made appearances together on national television, including the CBS Morning News. This led to the suggestion by co-host Phyllis George that the two embrace, outraging critics and audience alike. Later in 1985, Webb co-authored the book Forgive Me (written with Marie Chapian). In the book, Webb chronicled an extraordinarily troubled childhood. Her mother had suffered from mental illness and was institutionalized. Her father abandoned Webb to the custody of an elderly acquaintance who could not care for her properly. Denied family connection and affection, Webb said she became sexually active at the age of 12. Later, Webb detailed her involvement and interest in the Pilgrim Baptist Church in New Hampshire as well as the bible study that led to her atonement.  Resolution  Cathleen Crowell Webb returned to New Hampshire and avoided interviews and media exposure. Dotson, meanwhile, had not been cleared of the original rape charges. He had a troubled release from prison, including several parole violations. Webb sent him the advance she received from a book publisher (reportedly $17,500). Finally in 1988, a new type of DNA testing, known as the PCR technique, became available. This form of testing was accurate on degraded samples (taken from Webb in 1977) and proved that no contact between the two had taken place. Webb raised four children before dying of breast cancer on May 15, 2008, just a month before her 47th birthday.
