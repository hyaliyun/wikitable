The one-time community was located north of New Taiton on State Highway 71 (SH 71). Taiton's population peaked around 1910 but then went into decline. At some time, Taiton either moved south to New Taiton or was replaced by that community. Unlike New Taiton, Taiton is not identified by road signs, not shown on maps and not served by any Farm-to-market road. The additional fact that there are very few homes in the area suggests that Taiton has become a ghost town. Geography The historic location of Taiton was at . This coordinate is on SH 71 a distance of north-northwest of El Campo and south-southeast of Garwood. The precise location is on SH 71 between County Road 476 on the south and County Road 369. The Colorado County line is not far to the north. County Road 476 leaves SH 71 at right angles and heads east-northeast. County Road 369 continues the same direction to the north- northwest while SH 71 diverges slightly more to the north; the two roads intersect at a very acute angle. The Taiton Community Center can be found at the southeast corner of SH 71 and FM 961 in New Taiton. Saint John Nepomucene Catholic Church and cemetery are a short distance east of the community center on FM 961.See photo of church. Tait and York were alternate names for Taiton. History Taiton is described as being located on SH 71 a distance of north of New Taiton. The region was first settled by Anglo-Americans in 1886. However, numbers of German and Czech immigrants arrived in 1894 looking for land to cultivate near El Campo. The community was first named Tait but the name was changed to Taiton in 1896 when the post office was established. In 1901 Ignace Jurasek contributed land for a new schoolhouse to replace the old one. B. E. Medina opened a general store and there was a dance hall by 1903. The school reported 75 students and one teacher in 1905. Taiton's farmers raised cattle, corn, cotton, rice and watermelons. When the population climbed to 800 in 1910, the town included a dry-goods store, a produce buyer and some grocers. St. John Nepomucene Catholic Church was founded in 1912. Taiton's population declined after 1915. The school counted two teachers and 104 white and four black pupils in 1926, but only 20 people lived in the community. The post office closed sometime in the 1930s. In 1936, New Taiton showed up on a county map with a church, a factory and some homes. In the 1940s the Taiton school merged with the Rancho Grande community school and moved to a new location. Taiton had 80 residents in 1947 and included the church, school and two stores. Taiton is not marked at its historic location on the 1965 USGS Hahn Quadrangle, though the tiny community of Hahn is on the map. In the 1960s the Taiton area stretched across 35 square miles and had 325 residents.

Although a division of labor exists and women usually are not visible actors in political affairs outside the home, Turkmen women have never worn a veil similar to that of the women of some of its neighboring countries. As Turkmenistan is a tribal nation, customs regarding women can vary within the country: for example, women in the eastern part of the country are permitted to drink some alcohol whereas women who live in the central portion of the country, particularly those of the Tekke tribe, are not permitted to imbibe alcohol. Most women possess a host of highly specialized skills and crafts, especially those connected with the household and its maintenance.  Promoting gender equality  Two young women in Kazakhstan Women in Azerbaijan nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men; however, societal discrimination is a problem.

Apart from having the right to vote, around one-quarter of the women of Bahrain are able to hold jobs outside the confines of the household. Available data on health, nutrition, education, and economic performance indicated that in the 2014 women participation in the workforce was 57%. Bangladesh has a gender development index of .917. As financial controllers, the women of Cambodia can be identified as having real household authority at the familial level.Gender Roles and Statuses, everyculture.com In recent years, women have become more active in the traditionally male- dominated spheres of work and politics in Cambodia. October 1, 1949 marks the formal establishment of the People's Republic of China. Since 1949, the government of the People's Republic of China has actively promoted the cultural, social, economic and political roles of women in order to improve women's liberation. The new government of the People's Republic made a commitment to achieve equality between women and men. While advancing towards equality among men and women, the efforts met resistance in a traditionally Confucian society of male superiority. Although equality among men and women has been a long-term goal of the People's Republic of China, the dramatic reformations that followed the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976) have inconsistently affected women's empowerment and status in China. Studies shows that Chinese women experienced rapid progress in terms of gender equality during the Cultural Revolution. When the People's Republic of China was established, employed women accounted for only 7 percent of the workforce; whereas in 1992 women's participation in the workforce had increased to account for 38 percent. Women's representation in higher educational institutions has also increased since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Under the traditional Chinese patriarchy structure, the society was male-dominated, and women in Hong Kong had a relatively subordinate familial role. However, there is a cultural change in Hong Kong during the British colonial period with an emergence of Western culture (i.e. \\"Westernization\\"). A mix of traditional Chinese culture and Western values creates a unique culture of Hong Kong. Along with the rapid economic and social development of Hong Kong since the end of the Second World War, a significant improvement in the role of men has been witnessed, while female dominance society structure is still taking in place. Hence, women studies in Hong Kong are slightly differ from China's. Women in Hong Kong are generally more independent, monetarily autonomous, assertive, and career-focused; which makes them seem to be more prominent when comparing with women in some other Southeast Asian countries. With the increase number of women in professional and managerial positions in recent decades, the terms of \\"female strong person\\" or \\"superwomen\\" are being used to describe women in Hong Kong. Candice Chio Ngan Ieng, president of the Macau Women's General Association (AGMM), describes in 2010 that women are currently defining themselves as capable and irreplaceable powers to Macau's modern-day civilization. This change is happening despite the slowness in the Macanese people's absorption of the ideological concept of gender equality. The status of women in India has been subject to many great changes over the past few millennia. From equal status with men in ancient times through the low points of the medieval period, to the promotion of equal rights by many reformers, the history of women in India has been eventful. The roles of Indonesian women today are being affected by many factors, including increased modernization, globalization, improved education and advances in technology (in particular communications technology). Many women in Indonesia choose to reside in cities instead of staying in townships to perform agricultural work because of personal, professional, and family-related necessities, and economic requirements. These women are moving away from the traditional dictates of Indonesian culture, wherein women act simply and solely as wives and mothers. At present, the women of Indonesia are also venturing actively into the realm of national development, and working as active members of organizations that focus and act on women's issues and concerns. The Iranian women's movement is based on the Iranian women's social movement for women's rights. This movement first emerged some time after the Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1910, the year in which the first Women Journal was published by women. The movement lasted until 1933 in which the last women‚Äôs association was dissolved by the Reza Shah Pahlavi‚Äôs government. It heightened again after the Iranian Revolution (1979).Afary, Janet. The Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1906 - 1911, Columbia University Press, 1996. Between 1962 and 1978, the Iranian women's movement gained tremendous victories: women won the right to vote in 1963 as part of Mohammad Reza Shah's White Revolution, and were allowed to stand for public office, and in 1975 the Family Protection Law provided new rights for women, including expanded divorce and custody rights and reduced polygamy. Following the 1979 Revolution, several laws based on gender discrimination were established such as the introduction of mandatory veiling and public dress code of females. Women's rights since the Islamic Revolution has varied. About 9% of the Iranian parliament members are women, while the global average is 13%.On Women‚Äôs Day, struggle for equality remains, Kyiv Post (8 March 2012) Following the Revolution, women were allowed to join the police and military forces. The women's rights movement in Iran continues to attempt influencing reforms, particularly with the One Million Signatures Campaign to End Discrimination Against Women. Women in the country went through a difficult period in the 1990s, when Kazakhstan's economy, being in a period of transition, experienced a strong decline and destabilization: by 1995 real GDP dropped to 61,4% of its 1990 level, resulting also in a brain drain.http://www.kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_economics.shtmlhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/briefing_note/join/2013/522303/EXPO- INTA_SP%282013%29522303_EN.pdf Nevertheless, the 1990s also had some positives for women, such as the accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1998.https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg;_no=IV-8&chapter;=4‚ü®=en Women in Kuwait are considered to be among the most emancipated women in the Gulf region.2008 Freedomhouse report - Kuwait Women in Kuwait can travel, drive, and work without their fathers' or husbands' consent and they even hold senior government positions.

According to the book The Three Paradoxes: Working Women in Singapore written by Jean Lee S.K., Kathleen Campbell, and Audrey Chia, there are \\"three paradoxes\\" confronting and challenging the career women of Singapore. Firstly, Singapore's society expects women to become creative and prolific corporate workers who are also expected to play the role of traditional women in the household, particularly as wife and mother. Secondly, Singaporean women are confronted by the \\"conflict between work and family\\" resulting from their becoming members of the working population. Thirdly, Singapore's female managers are still fewer in number despite of their rising educational level and attainments when compared to male managers.Lee S.K., Jean, Kathleen Campbell, and Audrey Chia.

In the 2007/2008 United Nations Development Programme report, the UAE ranked 29th among 177 countries in the Gender Empowerment Measures, the best rating received in the Arab World.United Nations Human Development Report 2007/2008 UNDP‚Äôs Millennium Development Goal No. 3, to ‚ÄúPromote Gender Equality and Empower Women‚Äù has reached its targeted levels of female participation in primary education and continues to increase.UNDP Millennium Development Goals United Arab Emirates Report (PDF), p. 14 (March 2007). Women in Yemen have historically had much less power in society than men. Although the government of Yemen has made efforts that will improve the rights of women in Yemen (including the formation of a Women's Development Strategy and a Women Health Development Strategy), many cultural and religious norms, along with poor enforcement of this legislation from the Yemeni government, have prevented Yemeni women from having equal rights to men. Today, Yemeni women do not hold many economic, social or cultural rights. Even more striking is the reality that while suffrage was gained in 1967 and constitutional and legal protection was extended to women during the first years of Yemen unity between 1990‚Äì1994, they continue to struggle ‚Äúin exercising their full political and civil rights‚Äù.Basha, Amal. ‚ÄúYemen.‚Äù In Women‚Äôs Rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Citizenship and Justice, edited by Sameena Nazir and Leigh Tomppert. Oxford: Freedom House, 2005. History shows that women have played major roles in Yemeni society. Some women of pre-Islamic and early Islamic Yemen held elite status in society. The Queen of Sheba, for example, ‚Äúis a source of pride for the Yemeni nation‚Äù. In addition, Queen Arwa has been noted for her attention to infrastructure, which added to a documented time of prosperity under her rule. Modern day women of Yemen, however, are subject to a society that reflects largely agrarian, tribal, and patriarchal traditions. This, combined with illiteracy and economic issues has led women to continuously be deprived of their rights as citizens of Yemen. The roles of women in Thailand's national development has not yet been fully established. Factors that affect women's participation in the socio-economic field include \\"inadequate gender awareness in the policy and planning process\\" and social stereotyping.Key Figures, Gender Statistics, Social Statistics Division, National Statistical Office, Bangkok. During the Soviet period, women in Turkmenistan assumed responsibility for the observance of some Muslim rites to protect their husbands' careers. Many women entered the work force out of economic necessity, a factor that disrupted some traditional family practices and increased the incidence of divorce. At the same time, educated urban women entered professional services and careers. The social and legal situation of women in Uzbekistan has been influenced by local traditions, religion, the Soviet rule, and changing social norms since independence.http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/uploads/uzbekistan_domestic_violence_2000.pdf Women in Vietnam played a significant role in defending Vietnam during the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1975. They took roles such as village patrol guards, intelligence agents, propagandists, and military recruiters. By becoming \\"active participants\\" in the struggle to liberate their country from foreign occupation, Vietnamese women were able to free themselves from \\"centuries of Confucian influence that had made them second-class citizens\\". Historically, this character and spirit of Vietnamese women were first exemplified by the conduct of the Trung sisters, the ‚Äúfirst historical figures‚Äù in the history of Vietnam who revolted against Chinese control. These \\"women warriors\\" are not only fighting to protect their families, but also to preserve their culture. Trung Trac, the elder Trung sister, sacrificed herself and drowned over surrendering to foreign conquerors.This trait is also epitomized in the old Vietnamese adage: \\"When war comes, even women have to fight\\", and its variation: \\"When the enemy is at the gate, the woman goes out fighting\\".\\"Ba Me Anh Hung\\" (Hero Mothers), which is a term that has been coined recently, illustrates that even though Vietnamese women did not contribute greatly in combat, they were heroes that took care of children and overcame poverty. While the men were away in war, these women worked domestically to build up the next generation and the future of the country. Vietnamese women's roles in society would in turn develop Vietnam's socioeconomic status. \\"Women are laborers, citizens, mothers, and the first teachers of people...\\" Bangladeshi women peacekeepers at MONUSCO, Kinshasa = Women in government = As of 2007, several women in Azerbaijan held senior government positions, including deputy speaker of parliament, several deputy ministers, and deputy chair of the Central Election Commission.

Life and Work He was born in Leonessa March 11, 1666. Probably still very young, he moved to Rome where he had as a master of painting Giacinto Brandi. At the current state of knowledge we do not know in which year he settled in Perugia, probably before 1717, the date of his first remaining work. Certainly in Perugia he did all his activity; here, among other things, he married and his sons were born. He was elected director of the Academy of Fine Arts and was still in office in 1737, when the institute was closed by order of the authorities. He died in Perugia on March 17, 1746. One of his earliest signed works, a study (1689) for an altarpiece for the cathedral of Citt√† della Pieve.Now found in the Pinacoteca, Bettona. He moved to Perugia circa 1714, to become director of the local Academy of Fine Arts.http://www.keytoumbria.com/Perugia/Boccanera_Giacinto.html Biography at Key to Umbria. Cristoforo Gasperi and Carlo Speridone MariottiCatalogo dei quadri che si conservano nella Pinacoteca Vannucci in Perugia, by Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, (1903), page 64. served as his apprentice in the 1730s. An Adoration of the Magi in the church of Santa Maria di Colle, signed and dated 1717, is the earliest of Boccanera's works presently known. It is marked by a casual eclecticism absent from works features of his master Giacinto Brandi as well as in Venetian style of Francesco Trevisani. One of two altarpieces Boccanera painted for San Bernardo (current Intendenza di Finanza of Perugia) is dated 1714. Among the six paintings representing the patron saints of Perugia, destined for the chapel of the town hall and today held in storage by the Pinacoteca, the Saints Filino and Gratiniano show features that were not characteristic of Perugino Pietro Montanini. In the same warehouse was the Martyrdom of St. Giuliana, while in the church of Santo Spirito was the Baptism of the Emperor Constantius, dated 1731. Two ovals with saints adorn an altar of the church of Santa Teresa degli Scalzi.The church of Santa Teresa degli Scalzi was built in 1734 His last documented works were the frescoes in the church of San Filippo, made in 1735 (the ornaments were made by P. Brizi), in which the influence of Brandi is evident. So almost at the end of his career's trajectory, he returned to recall the intrepid \\"attitudes\\" in vogue fifty years earlier in the circle of Brandi, interpreting them with that license and overabundance that would displease \\"classicist\\" Orsini. Among the other Perugian Boccanera's paintings partly dispersed today, the sources recall: Last Supper in the old seminary, four paintings depicting a Martyrdom of St. Lorenzo, aSamaritan Woman, a Martyrdom of San Stefano, decorations in the oratory of the Confraternity of the Saints Fiorenzo and Simone and in the noble apartment of the Donini building.

Released digitally on May 20, 2013, \\"I Love American Music\\" marked the Daddies' first single since \\"Diamond Light Boogie\\" in 2000. Overview =Music and lyrics= Following the predominant Latin and ska influences of their 2008 album Susquehanna, White Teeth, Black Thoughts marked the first Daddies album since their hit 1997 compilation Zoot Suit Riot to consist entirely of jazz and swing music. As such, \\"I Love American Music\\" follows in the jump blues-influenced swing style as much of the album does, punctuated by the Daddies' trademark horn section and utilizing call and response vocalizations in the chorus. Perry has described \\"I Love American Music\\" as being a dedication to the fans and musicians of American roots music, particularly influenced by the figures of Eugene, Oregon's blues scene in the 1980s, such as Robert Cray, Henry Vestine and Curtis Salgado. In a blog post written on the day of the single's release, Perry elaborated \\"I think what touches me the most in retrospect [about the blues scene] were the kind of minor players who were nonetheless freaking fantastic and for one reason or another never got the notoriety.[...]These guys lived in squalor, in 1 room crash pads, in order to be able to do what they did, while their friends and relations went off to sell insurance, program computers, and generally take a shot at what they felt was the American dream. Unfortunately, this country does not value its cultural heritage, (its real dream) and mostly isn't even aware of its glorious history or the lives of their soulful poets. These poor bastards mostly go to their deaths unknown. Many I was fortunate to call my friends. So I wrote a little song for them\\". The song's chorus begins with the phrase \\"Play it again, Sam\\", a popular misquotation from the 1942 film Casablanca. =Release and reception= On May 15, 2013, \\"I Love American Music\\" was premiered on The Onions A.V. Club along with its music video, while the song was released to iTunes and Spotify as a digital single on May 20. On July 25, 2013, in the midst of a brief national tour supporting White Teeth, Black Thoughts, the Daddies appeared on the Fox-owned KTTV program Good Day L.A. where they performed a shortened version of \\"I Love American Music\\". Critical reception for White Teeth, Black Thoughts was generally positive, with some reviews highlighting \\"I Love American Music\\" as a standout track. Matt Collar of AllMusic referred to the \\"bluesy\\" song as among the album's more \\"compelling\\" tracks, while C-Ville Weekly positively described it as a \\"semi-sequel to 'Zoot Suit Riot'\\", noting \\"there is fun to be had here\\". Mitch Keiffer of Pop 'Stache, praising White Teeth as the Daddies' most \\"beautifully recorded\\" and \\"polished\\" album to date, wrote of \\"I Love American Music\\" as \\"a fun, vintage song\\" which \\"[covered] the most beloved aspects of the old Swing music the band is influenced by\\" as a \\"love song about American music\\". Music video \\"I Love American Music\\" was the first of five music videos the Daddies shot for White Teeth, Black Thoughts with the Bend, Oregon-based video production company AMZ Productions, marking the first music video the band had shot since \\"Brown Derby Jump\\" for Zoot Suit Riot in 1998. Directed by Steve Perry and Jesse Locke, the video humorously depicts Perry as himself, intently composing and singing along to the song while his frustrated wife - played by his real- life wife Yvette - stands to the sidelines. Perry credited the concept of the video to Yvette Perry, examining the song through another angle in how the dedication to the life of an artist affects his or her family. \\"Being a writer is a solitary job that never ends and steals away time from the people that you love\\", Perry wrote in a blog post, \\"It's a Sisyphean struggle often with more downs than ups. We wanted to show that tension between being a member of a band and the family, and ultimately the love and understanding that needs to be there for anything at all triumphant to get played\\".

Though he was selected by the Houston Astros in the sixth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, he opted not to sign with the Astros. At UCLA, Plutko was a member of the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In 2013, Plutko led the Bruins to their first NCAA Championship in baseball by beating Mississippi State in the 2013 College World Series. During the World Series, he recorded wins against Louisiana State in the opening round of the World Series and in Game 1 of the Championship Series against Mississippi State. He was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player. Professional career The Cleveland Indians selected Plutko in the 11th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Indians, but did not pitch for their Minor League Baseball affiliates that year due to a stress fracture in his shoulder. Plutko made his professional debut in 2014 with the Lake County Captains of the Class A Midwest League.

Given suitable conditions, this process can often result in a positive outcome, but Williams avoids the romantic notion that psychosis is always beneficial. Much of what Williams says is in close accord with a recovery approach.

It is located in central Athens, at the junction of Panepistimiou Avenue with Omirou Street and is dedicated to Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, disciple of the Apostle Saint Paul and the first bishop of Athens. History and construction The interior of the church The church is a three-aisle basilica in the neo-Renaissance style. Plans tasked to do the famous German architect Leo von Klenze, the behest of King Otto of Greece. The architecture is influenced by St Boniface's Abbey in Munich. During the project, the plans were modified by the Greek architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, who offered to direct the work of the church, until completion, without any remuneration. The land for the construction of the church was purchased in 1847 with money collected among the Roman Catholics of Greece, while the building was built by fundraisers among Catholics both inside and outside the country. The nave was built in 1853 and the inauguration took place on 4 August 1865. The church is 38 metres long, 15 metres high and 24 metres wide. The church's interior is decorated with beautiful frescoes. Of the most beautiful is the fresco of semi-domes of triumphal arch, representing the Apotheosis of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite (1890) and is the work of Italian painter from Rimini Guglielmo Bilancioni (1836-1907). The pillars, which support the triumphal arch, represent in life- size the four Evangelists. In front of the triumphal arch is depicted Christ Pantocrator with the Gospel in hand. In the adjacent corner on the right is Moses holding a parchment, and on the left the Prophet David playing a harp. Below are Saint Gregory the Great and Saint Augustine. The church floor is paved with Pentelic marble. The nave is supported by 12 columns of 5 metres of green marble from Tinos. The platform of dance above the main entrance of the temple, which is also the Pipe organ, was built in 1888 by architect Paul Sambi (Paul Chambaut). Right and left of the main entrance are two inscriptions, one in Latin, the other in modern Greek, commemorating the Athenian visit of pope John Paul II in 2001. Finally, right and left of the sanctuary are two marble pulpits, donated by Franz Joseph I of Austria when he visited Athens in 1869. In 1962, the Catholic marriage of Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark and Infante Juan Carlos of Spain took place in the church, which preceded the Orthodox wedding rites. The stained glass windows of the church Stained glass depiction of Otto of Bamberg The eight stained glass windows on both sides of the lower part of the church were painted by the director of the royal workshops of Munich Carl de Boucher (Karl de Bouchet) and donated by King Ludwig of Bavaria. The four windows of the right aisle of the church adorn respectively stained glass of Saint Amalia, Pope Sixtus II, Pope Telesphorus, Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, and the stained glass windows of the left aisle depicting the Saint Otto, the Pope Anterus, Pope Anacletus and the Saint John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of Constantinople.

The zones are mapped to be hundreds of kilometers in diameter and tens of kilometers thick. Their shear wave velocities can be up to 30% lower than surrounding material. The composition and origin of the zones remain uncertain. The zones appear to correlate with edges of the African and Pacific Large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) as well as the location of hotspots. Czechowski L.(1993). The Origin of Hotspots and The D‚Äù Layer. In: Montag H., Reigber C. (eds) Geodesy and Physics of the Earth. International Association of Geodesy Symposia, vol 112. Discovery and constraints ULVZs are discovered by the delay and scattering of body waves that reflect and diffract on or are refracted by the core-mantle boundary. Different body waves types give different constraints on the dimensions or velocity contrasts of the ULVZ. Even though ULVZs are discovered in places, it remains difficult to map out their extent and constrain their density and velocity. Usually trade-offs between various parameters exist. In general though, ULVZs appear to be a hundred to a thousand kilometers across and tens of kilometers thick (although existing thinner or smaller ULVZs might fall below the resolution of seismology). Their shear wave velocity reduction is on the order of -10 to -30% and the compressional wave velocity reduction tends to be weaker. Composition and origin ULVZs are hypothesized to be enriched in iron, be partially molten or a combination of both, or result of the presence of carbon. Different scenarios have been proposed for the iron enrichment: iron could be leaking from the core, have accumulated over past subduction, or be remnants of a basal magma ocean. Both silicate perovskite and periclase (which are thought to be present in the lowermost mantle) show reduced velocities with increasing iron at these pressures and temperatures. Experiments with iron and water under the conditions present form an iron peroxide FeO2Hx that will contribute to ULVZ. Distribution and dynamics ULVZs have higher density than their surroundings to remain stable on the core-mantle boundary. In a general mantle convection setting, the density contrast as well as the amount of material available would control the morphology/shape of the ULVZ. So far a range of sizes for ULVZs has been found.Torsvik, Trond H.; Smethurst, Mark A.; Burke, Kevin; Steinberger, Bernhard (2006). \\"Large igneous provinces generated from the margins of the large low-velocity provinces in the deep mantle\\". Geophysical Journal International. 167 (3): 1447‚Äì1460. Bibcode:2006GeoJI.167.1447T. doi:10.1111/j.1365- The location and shape of the ULVZs can also be controlled by the presence of thermo-chemical piles (or LLSVPs). The denser ULVZ material heaps up at the edges of these piles. Hawaiian ULVZ The Hawaiian ULVZ appears to be the largest ULVZ mapped to date. It sits on the core-mantle boundary slightly to the west of the Hawaiian hotspot at the northern boundary of the Pacific large low-shear-velocity province. It is mapped out to be roughly 1000 km across and 20 km high. Its large aspect ratio dynamically suggests it is very dense. Its shear wave velocity reduction is roughly 20% compared to surrounding material. It remains speculative if there is a correlation between this large ULVZ and the presence of the strongest hotspot flux at the surface; potentially the ULVZ could be an anchor to a whole-mantle plume. Cartoon of ultra low velocity zones (red structures) and the Pacific large low shear velocity province (red transparent) on the core of the Earth (blue) Samoan ULVZ The Samoan is another mega-ultra-low velocity zone which lies directly beneath the Samoa hotspot. This zone is roughly 800 by 250 km (roughly the size of Florida) and is 10‚Äì15 km high. Its material appears 45% slower in shear wave velocity, 15% slower in compressional wave velocity and 10% denser. Additionally, the ULVZ appears to lie in a gap of the Pacific LLSVP (not represented in the illustration here), leading to the hypothesis that this slow material is pushed to the center by surrounding large piles.

The combination became one of the strongest in Winston Cup racing as Waltrip and Parrott won ten races in the 1977‚Äì1978 seasons. In 1979, Waltrip finished a close second in points. After winning four races in the first half of 1980, Parrott was fired from the DiGard team; he finished the season with the Harry Ranier team and driver Buddy Baker. Parrott was hired by Charlotte medical doctor Ron Benfield as crew chief for a team he had formed for 1981. For three seasons Parrott was crew chief of Benfield's No. 98 racecars driven by Johnny Rutherford, Morgan Shepherd, Rusty Wallace and Joe Ruttman. In 1984, Parrott was hired by Mike Curb to be Richard Petty's crew chief. Parrott and Petty won at Dover, and was chief for Petty's 200th career victory in the 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway. In 1987 & 1988, Parrott joined Jocko's Racing and became a part-time crew chief for the No. 63 team. Maggiacomo was involved in Bobby Allison's career-ending accident and parted ways with the team shortly after. In 1990 later, Parrott joined Derrike Cope of Bob Whitcomb Racing's team, and helped him win the 1990 Daytona 500. In 1992, Parrott was reunited with Wallace at Penske Racing, winning 18 races together. Three years later, he joined Diamond Ridge Motorsports to work with Steve Grissom. However, Parrott left the team citing business disagreements with owner Gary Bechtel. In 1997, he joined Jeff Burton's crew, and helped him win the inaugural race at Texas Motor Speedway. Later that season, Parrott was fined $20,000 by NASCAR for improperly mounted roof flaps prior to the Winston 500 at Talladega. In 1998, he became the team manager for Mark Martin's Roush Racing team. At California Speedway that year, Parrott tripped over cords in the pit box, fracturing his ribs, but still celebrated Martin's victory in the 1998 California 500. He remained with the team until his retirement in 2001 after 34 years of service. In 2004, Parrott was inducted into the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame.

The bout took place on 15 July 2000 at the London Arena in England. Lewis defeated Botha via second-round technical knockout to retain his heavyweight titles. Background Following an easy victory over the previously undefeated Michael Grant on 29 April, Lennox Lewis agreed to make his next defense against South African contender Francois Botha. The fight was also announced to take place in Lewis' native London, making it his first championship fight there since being defeated by Oliver McCall in 1994.Lewis to Fight Botha in London, N.Y. Times article, 2000-05‚Äì19, Retrieved on 2013-06-26 Botha, meanwhile, was coming off an impressive performance against Mike Tyson in which he dominated the former undisputed champion for four rounds before Tyson was able to land a quick right hand in the fifth round to earn a knockout victory. Botha then fought a close majority draw with fellow heavyweight contender Shannon Briggs and earned an easy first round knockout victory over journeyman Steve Pannell before landing the championship fight with Lewis. Lewis, however, faced criticism for choosing to face Botha, who was ranked at number nine by the WBC and not ranked at all by the IBF. Though Botha came into the fight as a huge underdog, he remained confident that he could defeat Lewis stating \\"If I don‚Äôt knock him out, it‚Äôs going to be a terrible beating.\\"Preview of Lennox Lewis-Frans Botha Bout, ABC News article, 2000-07‚Äì15, Retrieved on 2013-06-26 The fight Like in his previous fight with Grant, Lewis would make short work of Botha. Lewis dominated the duration of the fight, landing 24 of his 47 thrown punches while Botha only managed to land nine punches through the entire fight while opting to take a more defensive approach. With one minute left in the first round, Lewis staggered Botha with a right hook, but Botha managed to stay on his feet and avoid the knockdown. Lewis attempted to capitalize and pursued Botha aggressively in an attempt to gain a knockdown, but Botha was able to weather Lewis' attack by clinching and survived the first round without being knocked down. In the second round, Botha tried to keep his distance from Lewis and offered very little offence in the round. With about 40 seconds left in the round, Lewis was able to land a powerful four punch combination that knocked Botha halfway out of the ring. Botha crawled back in and was able to get back on his feet but was clearly hurt from the exchange, prompting referee Larry O'Connell to stop the fight, handing Lewis his second consecutive second-round knockout victory.Lewis Keeps Title While Tyson Waits, N.Y.

History After the release of Sockweb's first song, \\"I Want Pancakes\\", the group became a viral hit in metal circles, with websites such as MetalSucks and eventually reputed UK magazine Rock Sound. After the release of two more songs, \\"Broken Glass Swan Dive\\" and \\"Werewolf\\" (featuring Spiralmountain's Erik Ebsen), the duo announced that they had signed to Monolithic Records to release their debut album, Werewolf, later in 2013, accompanied by another new song, \\"Bullies Are Mean\\".

Treasure Hill is an east-jutting spur of the White Pine Range of White Pine County in the easte central of the U.S. states of Nevada. Hamilton is situated at the northern base of the hill while Treasure City is situated on the hill, from Hamilton. It lies to the east of Mount Hamilton and to the northwest of Mokomoke Hill. It was noted for its silver mining from 1867 until the late 1880s. Between 1867 and 1880, the total production from the mines of the Treasure Hill was valued at $20 million. By early 1881 the mining activity had collapsed as the mining of the hill was dependent on the deposits and not on the lasting silver bearing geological veins. As a result, by 1888 there were only 24 people living there with the principal towns of Hamilton at the base of the hill, the Treasure City on the hill side and the Shermantown went into oblivion. History The first expedition to the area of the White Pine region in Nevada was by Austin-based explorers who found copper, lead, antimony, and iron, and exploration was started by the Monte Cristo Mining Company. However, soon enough, in the autumn of the same year, silver deposits were found in the region on the Treasure Hill. This was chance discovery as one of the ethnic Indian known as Nagpias Jim (Nagpias means Silver) had showed the rich ore taken from a location in the region to his friend A. J. Lesthers, a blacksmith, who converted it into a silver button (the value of silver at the time was $1.32 per ounce). Later the area where the ore was found became the Hidden Treasure Mine, the yield from one ton of ore from this mine was worth $500‚Äì800. The next mine yielded $800‚Äì1000 per ton of ore and the third mine proved to a bonanza of pure silver, a \\"putty\\", with a yield potential of $15000-20000 per ton of ore. The crest of the hill was a barren wind swept land before many claimants established their stores with mining claims and drilling every few feet away from each other. Then the staking fever ensued with \\"every boomer, promoter, card shark, merchant-capitalist, prostitute and prospector in the West\\" making a beeline to the Treasure Hill. This discovery in the spring of 1868 of silver ore on Treasure Hill led to a prosperous but short-lived boom called the \\"shortest and most intense mining rush.\\" The hill was named after the notable ore discoveries. =Hamilton= The nearest establishment to operate the mines was set up at the Cave City at the foot of the hill in 1868 and its name was changed later to Hamilton. The discovery of silver created what was termed as ‚ÄúWhite Pine Fever.‚Äù Hotel and saloons were soon established. In 1869, the floating population reported was 10,000. Once water supply was established to the towns, several mills sprung up around the towns. Smelting works were built at a cost of $ 60000, the furnaces were housed in a big building and a 20-ton capacity and 45 ft long smoke stack was created. A 10 stamp Nevada started functioning from 20 May 1869 and a 20 stamp Big Smoky called the Treasure Hill was established on 24 May 1869. Further expansion of the mills occurred on 1 June 1869 with setting up of the 24 Stamp Manhattan. Ruins in the Hamilton Mining town =Swansea= Swansea, founded in 1869, is west of Hamilton. Swansea was named for the Swansea, Wales, which is known for its copper smelting. The Swansea Mill milled ores from Treasure City and Hamilton. At the peak of the Treasure Hill boom, the residents of Swansea thought that larger mills would soon need to be built and that the main street of Swansea would need to be extended to Shermantown (less than away. However, Shermantown annexed Swansea in late 1869. Some rock ruins remain. =Shermantown= By 1869, Shermantown, with a population of about 3000, had become dependent on the mines at Treasure Hill. A series of towns with populations up to 10,000 people grew up in the county, fueled by the prosperity of the silver mining on Treasure Hill. Over a 2year period until 1887, the Treasure Hill mines produced $22,000,000 worth of silver. With the wealth that the industry on Treasure Hill produced, the early prospectors were said to have loved \\"horseracing, gambling, and celebrations of all sorts\\" at the nearby camp in Hamilton This boom resulted in three cities coming into existence, Hamilton at the foot of the hills, Treasure City on the hills, and the Sherman Town which developed purely as a miners town. The Treasure Hill and Hamilton are where great white pine rush was created and there was large migration to both places. This resulted in establishing the White Pine County on 1 April 1869. Hamilton was its largest town. However this rush faded in the 1870s when new discoveries were made at Cherry Creek and Ward. With the Silver Rush in the county, Catholic missions grew up in the area in the late 1860s. Peter and Paul Parish under Fr. Dominic Monteverde set up stations at Treasure Hill and Piedmont, and a set up a mission at Cherry Creek. Treasure Hill was seriously affected by a devastating fire in the town of Hamilton in 1873 which had affected other towns in White Pine County. Nonetheless, the prospectors later found significant deposits of silver ore in the lower depths of the hill and the industry continued in the late 1870s and early 1880s. An 1885 fire which gutted the courthouse and much of the town of Hamilton, however, marked the end of the prosperity and \\"removed most of the evidence that a rich camp had ever existed there\\". Today the hill lies with the Humboldt National Forest area, established in 1908. =Revival= There was short-lived revival of mining activity in the 1920s. A claim covering an area of was staked by Treasure Hills Deposit Mining Company. They had sunk a deep shaft and their production was to the extent of $1.2 million in two years but they soon folded up in 1928. Mining activity had been revived again with a new processing technique using cyanide leaching operations. Geology High-grade silver ore, \\"with silica, calcite, silver oxide and manganese oxide in brecciated limestone\\" were found here. The mines of Treasure Hill are said to exhibit \\"exceptional occurrences\\"; the Eberhardt Mine in particular is said to contain \\"one of the most remarkable occurrences on record as a 6-ton mass, with small grayish to yellowish-green crystals.\\" When detailed geological investigations were carried out by Geologists from the US and Britain, their finding was a dampner to the development of the mines in the hill. They inferred that the ores found were mere deposits only and not sourced by ore bearing veins in the rocks which could produce mineral ore for a long period. This revelation coupled with miners strikes and bad weather conditions resulted in a mass exodus of people, in 1870, from the mining belt.

Among the regulations outlined in the plan were initiatives to increase natural disaster preparedness, create and improve existing hospitals, and modernize infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather. The plan would have support conservation of land and water resources and developing actionable climate science, and encouraged other countries to take action to address climate change, including reducing deforestation and lowering subsidies that increase use of fossil fuels. The plan specifically mentioned methane, building efficiency, wind, solar and hydroelectricity. White House staff members who were directly tasked with implementation of the plan included Heather Zichal and Michelle Patron. Cancellation of Obama's Climate Action Plan On the first day of the presidency of Donald Trump, the White House website announced that Obama's Climate Action Plan would be eliminated, stating it is 'harmful and unnecessary'. In March 2017, Trump signed an executive order to officially nullify Obama's Clean Power Plan in an effort, it said, of reviving the coal industry.

He joined Tongmenghui ÂêåÁõü‰ºö in Germany 1910. This was Sun Yat Sun's underground organization which recruited and raised money overseas for the revolution. Ku was an active member. He returned to China in 1917 as Professor of German and head of the German department, later as head of the Economics department. December 1925 he became president of Guangdong University Âπø‰∏úÂ§ßÂ≠¶. Shortly after, in December 1926, he transferred to Zhongshan University ‰∏≠Â±±Â§ßÂ≠¶. January 1926 he was elected a member of the executive committee of the Nationalist Party ÂõΩÊ∞ëÂÖöÔºåand assigned in May to the vetting committee. After the May 3 incident, Ku - together with Wang Ching Wei's other supporters Wang Leh-p'ing, Ch'en Kung-po, Wang Fa-ch'in, and Chu Chi-ch'ing - founded the Society for Koumintang Reorganization, which sought to reconcile Wang and Chiang Kai shek. Ku became the Railroad Minister in 1932, then Transportation Minister in 1935. In December of the same year, he served Cabinet of Ministers as the Minister of Commerce. During World War II, his political benefactor Ê±™Á≤æÂç´ cooperated with the Japanese despite numerous objections from him. Ku then immediately disassociated himself publicly and successfully continue to work with Chiang Kai Shek who shortly appointed him as President of Central University. In 1949, Ku moved to Hong Kong and published the journal„ÄäÁÅ´ÈÅì]. He co-founded the Fighting League for Chinese Freedom and Democracy, a Third Force organization supported by the CIA. After that in the 1960s he lived in Berkeley, California. Returned to Taiwan in 1972 and died peacefully there. Ku Meng-yu was a brilliant man, affable and with a sparkle in his eyes.

They directly challenged Chiang for party leadership. Chiang suspended his party membership for 3 years in 1929. Ku continued the challenge during this time. Chiang Kai shek accepted him as one the few people whose challenges were legitimate. *Qing locomotive at Xugezhuang ËÉ•ÂêÑÂ∫ÑÁ´ôThe railway system was a mess left over from Qing Dynasty corruption when he became Railway Minister in 1932. It was a collection of segments with no common physical of personnel standards. The Guangdong line went nowhere in 30 years of construction. He undertook a complete overhaul beginning with national standards modelled on the German system and financed it through a national bonds. He implemented it by employing the younger generation and by recruiting overseas educated engineers. It was an age of turmoil but also an age when everything was possible. He understood that and knew how to motivate those who worked for him. The system was under control within 2 years. Both Guangdong and Xian lines were completed. This achievement bore fruit both immediately and long term. * = Vignette = Ku Meng Yu È°æÂ≠ü‰Ωô was appointed President of Central University in 1941. The government institutions were modelled along the Soviet system with parallel uparty cadres at every level. First thing he did was to remove all cadres to assert academic freedom. He then understook a series of actions to enrich and broaden the curriculum. He also broadened the student base by more flexible entrance requirements. All thse were popular with the university community. One day in February 1942 Chiang Kai Shek delivered a speech at the university and Ku sent a deputy to attend in his place. Chiang was furious at this and publicly criticized him. Ku immediately resigned. This led to prolonged student protests and finally a strike. Chiang personally went to see him twice to withdraw the resignation but he still refused. It is the only known instance where Chiang publicly acknowledge an error. It was also the end of Ku's government service.

The Chronicle of the Morea mentions that the barony, centred on the mountain town of Kalavryta, comprised twelve knight's fiefs, with Otho of Durnay as the first baron.Miller (1921), pp. 71‚Äì72Bon (1969), p. 467 In the 1260s, he was succeeded by Geoffrey of Durnay, who is attested as being active as late as 1289.

He has been covered by Forbes, Sports Illustrated, Wired, Outside Magazine, The Financial Times, and other publications. In 2015 he was voted 5th nationwide in \\"Top 40 under 40 in Healthcare Innovation\\" An athlete on the U.S. Cycling Team and alternate for the 1996 Olympic Team and winner of the 2000 Olympic Trials, Christopherson is known for breaking a World Record in 2011 in the velodrome sprint, notably using a ‚Äòdigital health‚Äô model inspired by Dr. Eric Topol. The previous holder of the record, Steven Alfred, subsequently received a lifetime ban for performance-enhancing drug use. He founded the real estate photography company Vicaso in 2006, and the biometrics and genomics health company Optimized Athlete in 2012. Optimized Athlete consulted with the 2012 women's cycling team prior to the 2012 London Olympics. The Greater Meaning of Water, his first feature documentary, was released in 2010, and was given the ‚ÄòAudience Choice‚Äô and 'Best Cinematography' awards at the Los Angeles All Sports Film Festival, and 'Best Spiritual Film' at the 2010 Amsterdam International Film Festival. He has a pending documentary, Personal Gold. Early life Sky Christopherson was born on January 19, 1976 to American parents, and raised by his parents in Tucson, Arizona in the United States. He had an early interest in both sports, film, and technology, using a Sears video camera to create 3D playback when he was eight years old. Cycling career =Early years= Christopherson won his first national title in bicycle racing at age 19, beating a six-time undefeated cyclist in a controversial event at the 1995 US National Championships. His specialty was the 1,000-meter time trial, considered to be the most painful event in sprint cycling. Christopherson is one of five Americans in history to ride a sub 1:03.0 in the 1000m ‚ÄòKilometer‚Äô event. He was quoted \\"My blood was turned into battery acid...I would commonly ride that fine line of losing consciousness.\\" ;Project 96 He was named to the U.S. National Cycling Team in 1995 following a win of two national titles at the U.S. National Track Cycling Championships. Accordingly, he was made part of ‚ÄòProject 96‚Äô to prepare for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The program included experimental ‚ÄòHyperoxic' training using enriched oxygen at the U.S. Olympic Training Center. Christopherson was named official alternate to the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Cycling Team. ;Union Cycliste Internationale He made his international debut in the 1000m placing 6th at the 1996 UCI Track Cycling World Cup in Cali, Colombia, and later 7th at the same event. When racing at the international level, he never ranked lower than ninth in the world. He placed 4th at the 1997 UCI Track Cycling World Cup in Adelaide, Australia, and 9th at the 1997 UCI World Track Cycling Championships. In 1998, he transitioned to the Team Sprint event with Marty Nothstein and Erin Hartwell, winning Silver at the 1998 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and 4th at the 1998 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Bordeaux, France. ;Later Olympics He battled upper respiratory illnesses throughout the 1998 and 1999 seasons, developing walking pneumonia in 1999. In 2000, Christopherson won the U.S. Olympic Trials in Frisco, TX in the 1000m and Team Sprint Events, and was named alternate to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Team allowed through new rules. Past Biker Stories in 2000 Following the Closing Ceremonies at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he proposed to his girlfriend Tamara Jenkins, an Olympian in flatwater kayaking. He continued training for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but after breaking his femur in a bike crash, decided to retire from competitive racing. He joined the Washington Athletic Club in January 2007, where he helped to create \\"the program that will be giving sponsorship to athletes training for the Olympics.\\" =World record= In 2010 he made a bid to return to the 2012 London Olympics, notable by his use of a ‚Äòdigital health‚Äô model inspired by Dr. Eric Topol. The project was a subject of a TEDx talk Christopherson gave in Del Mar, CA, and a Quantified Self talk at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. The training led to a World Record in the 35+ 200m velodrome sprint. The previous record holder Steven Alfred received a lifetime ban for use of performance-enhancing drugs. When asked how he trained, Christopherson stated, \\"In prior efforts we did not have the ability to formulate such a complete picture with data amassed continuously 24/7. This time around I benefited from genetic testing, sleep data, glucose tracking, etc.\\" Business career =Vicaso= Upon retirement, Christopherson began attending UC San Diego, where he studied film and graduated in 2006. In 2005, during his studies at UCSD, he founded Vicaso, a real estate photography service. Headquartered in Seattle, UCSD has stated \\"the startup was wildly successful, turning over $1.2 million in its first year.\\" and over $6.5 million since. The company works with brokerages such as Prudential, Redfin, and Coldwell Banker, among others. It specializes in high dynamic range (HDR) photography. =OAthlete= In July 2012 The Financial Times revealed that several health technology companies have supplied Olympics athletes with devices intended to optimize their performance, in what CNN said some people were calling \\"the Twitter Olympics\\" and the \\"Data Olympics.\\" OAthlete, a company co-founded by Christopherson, and another athlete earlier that year, helped the US track cycling team (specifically the women's sprint cycling team) track their health with glucose monitors, a sleep monitor, and genetic reports indicating nutritional needs and muscular capacity. About using the method, Christopherson stated, \\"When we arrived in Spain [to consult for OAthlete] we met a [US track cycling team] that was basically underfunded and only had one coach, while comparatively their competition were well funded and had experts staffed full-time: sports physiologists, psychologists, video analysis, you name it. Without any of this, we had to figure out how to ‚Äòboot- strap‚Äô additional support. We started with a genetic test for each athlete to provide context for the tracking and intervention strategies. What unfolded was amazing.\\" The women's team broke a national record two weeks before competing in London and went on to beat the favored Australians in the semi- finals, culminating their run with a silver medal at the London Olympics. The company continues to operate as a \\"firm engaged in using genomics, self quantification, and bioinformatics to improve human performance.\\" Film career =The Greater Meaning of Water= In 2005 Christopherson began to work seriously in film, as a film producer, screenplay writer, editor, and cinematographer. He released his first feature film, The Greater Meaning of Water, to various film festivals in 2010. Executive producers included Louise Thompson, Adam Sumner, and David Christopherson. He also worked with writer J. Elizabeth Martin, and it was produced by Christopherson's film production company, Amorgen Pictures. Kirk Krack, of the documentary The Cove, also took part. The film took over four years to complete, and follows the story of Max Avery (Justin Flint Williford), as he pursues competitive freediving as an emotional and physical respite from chronic lung disease. His love for the potentially deadly sport, however, causes a rift between Avery and his father, a cautious physician. Christopherson had first met Justin Williford when they were roommates at the Olympic Training Center, where Wiliford was a shotgun shooter. It premiered as part of the 2010 Los Angeles All Sports Film Festival, where it won ‚ÄòBest Cinematography‚Äô for feature film, and was voted ‚ÄòAudience Choice‚Äô award for feature film. It also won 'Best Spiritual Film' at the 2010 Amsterdam International Film Festival. =Personal Gold= Christopherson helped his women teammates prepare for the Olympics in Mallorca, Spain, including video analysis of the training which formed the behind-the-scenes content for the documentary. The team won an ‚Äòunderdog‚Äô Silver Medal at the 2012 London Olympic Games in the inaugural Women's Team Pursuit. It was the first US women's track cycling medal in over 20 years. \\"Personal Gold\\" documentary was filmed in London, Palma De Mallorca in the Balearic Islands in Spain, and California. It features Dr. Eric Topol and the athletes and associates involved with the team. It is set to star Sarah Hammer, Dotsie Bausch, and Jennie Reed. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival, the largest and highest attended film festival in the United States, and completed a full 40 event film festival circuit worldwide including a Great Britain premiere at the 2015 Manchester International Film Festival. The film won Audience Choice at the 2015 San Luis Obispo International Film Festival. Personal life Sky Christopherson's parents live in Tucson, Arizona.

After Legionella pneumophila, this species has been isolated most frequently from water samples. This species is also one of the several pathogenic forms of Legionella having been associated with rare clinical cases of illness including Pontiac fever and Legionnaires' disease. History This species was first isolated from water during a nosocomial outbreak in the United States between March 1980 and June 1981. The type strain of L. anisa is WA-316-C3 (ATCC 35292). The first reported clinical detection was in 1986, with a female patient in Victoria, Australia, who presented with pneumonia. Similar to other Legionella species, person-to- person transmission has not been documented. Structure Like other Legionella species, L. anisa is a thin, aerobic, pleomorphic, flagellated, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium. A distinguishing characteristic is the ability of colonies to exhibit blue-white autofluorescence when viewed under ultraviolet light. Thus, L. anisa, along with several other species of Legionella, is sometimes referred to as \\"blue-white\\" Legionella.  Detection  Legionella anisa is traditionally detected using the same culture methods as described for Legionella. However, some research suggests L. anisa may require a co-culture method that accounts for the close relationship with amoebae. When present in a sample but still contained within an amoeba host, the plating method may return false-negative results. Adjusting currently accepted laboratory analysis may be required to better understand the true clinical and environmental prevalence of this particular species. Genome-based analytical techniques may prove especially useful for L. anisa, as a study of isolates from various locations in France suggest that the genomic variation is much more limited and homogenous than other Legionella species. In addition, such techniques greatly reduce the time required to obtain results. Symptoms Infections may be asymptomatic, and are strongly associated with the respiratory system. Early symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, cough, muscle aches and pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, sputum production with presence of blood, nausea, and irritation or inflammation of the nose, throat, or lungs. Most people who breathe in the bacteria do not become ill. The risk of disease is increased with age, smoking, and in people with weakened immune systems. A multinational study found that less than 3% of reported Legionella infections were due to L. anisa.

With The hatchery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. History In the 1870s a nationwide movement for fish hatcheries emerged, aimed at supplying freshwater fish for consumers and sportsmen. Wisconsin started its own program in 1874. In 1906 the Delafield Fish Hatchery was established - the second hatchery in this state system. Two bass-rearing ponds were built that first year. Four more were built the following year, along with the stylish stone building that survives today. J.T.W. Jennings designed the building in Tudor Revival style, with a steep hip roof, prominent chimney, parapets above the dormers, and walls of colorful fieldstone. It contained offices and two walleye tanks. The hatchery drew its water from Nagawicka Lake. Walleye fry were propagated by placing eggs in Chase jars. Then water was fed into the bottom of the jar, passing up through the eggs. After the fish hatched they swam through the jars to the two large tanks, from which they were transferred to lakes and streams. The Delafield hatchery could produce 50 million walleye fry per year. bass were grown in the six outdoor ponds - a more natural environment. Adult bass were allowed to build nests and fertilize the eggs. When the youngsters hatched and grew enough, they were transferred from the ponds to the wild. The hatcheries fry mostly went to lakes and streams in southern Wisconsin. It served that original purpose until 1950, when bass were successfully reproducing in the wild, and the state decided to focus its walleye propagation on the northern part of the state. With that, the Delafield hatchery was converted into a research center on bass and walleye. In 1980, the state deeded the site to the city and has since been used for public recreation.

Premise  The film follows the experience of four young friends as they live on less than $1 a day for two months in rural Guatemala. They battle hunger, parasites and the realization that there are no easy answers. Yet, the generosity and strength of Rosa, a 20-year-old woman with her husband Anthony, and Chino, a 12-year-old boy, gives them hope that there are effective ways to make a difference.  Inception  The project did not start out as a film, but rather short YouTube videos that went viral, amassing over 650,000 views on the site. Inspired by the response, the four college friends produced a 56-minute film from the experience. They have since taken the film on a national tour to 25 major universities, receiving coverage on CBS This Morning with Charlie Rose. The film won best documentary for the audience award at the Sonoma International Film Festival and Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus calls it, \\"A must watch film, that provides a unique look into the hardship and hope of life in extreme poverty.\\" Similarly, Gary Ross, the Writer and Director of the first Hunger Games film, calls the film \\"moving, inspiring and important.\\". Due to their film and impact work, directors Chris and Zach have been recognized alongside Angelina Jolie and Bill Gates as two of the top 100 Visionary Leaders of 2015 by Real Leaders Magazine.

Los Angeles Daily Herald, 30 July 1888, p. 2, accessed 25 June 2013 A few years later, during divorce proceedings, it was alleged that Porter had, on more than one occasion during their marriage, brutally beat her. Stanley received her divorce in July 1890. Later life Stanley retired in 1902 after playing Mrs. Veasey in The House Agent's Dilemma at Queen's Gate Hall, South Kensington, and largely disappeared from the public eye. In the late 1920s she moved into a five-room flat in Notting Hill Gate. During this time, she was living on a ¬£20 per month (nearly $100) trust fund.

Wan studied Wing Chun kung fu under Wong Shun Leung Early life and introduction to Wing Chun As a teen, Wan studied a variety of styles of kung fu as well as other styles of martial arts. Wan emigrated from mainland China to Hong Kong in 1959. There, his brother introduced him to Wing Chun kung fu. His first Wing Chun teacher was Leung Sheung, known to be the most senior student of Ip Man. He studied with Leung for seven months. In 1962, another Wing Chun practitioner named Wong Shun Leung - another student of Yip Man - was opening a school across the street from Wan's home in Kowloon. Wan went to inquire about training with Wong, who told him to return later when the school was ready to open. Wan, who had learned of Wong and appreciated his philosophy and approach to kung fu, came back when the school opened and became Wong's first official student. After three months, Wong waived tuition for Wan due to his diligence and dedication to the school. Wan became Wong's close student and training partner. He continued to train closely with Wong for twenty years. Wing Chun career Wan Kam Leung began teaching as a sifu in 1969 after seven years of training under Wong Shun Leung. Through Wong Shun Leung, Wan met and trained with famed martial artist Bruce Lee upon Lee's return to Hong Kong from America. Lee invited Wong Shun Leung to a screen test in 1973, several months before Lee's passing, and Wong took Wan along with him. Once, Wan witnessed a spar between Wong and Lee in Lee's Kowloon Tong home. Wong had claimed his hands were faster than Lee's, and Lee retaliated by saying that his kicks were much faster than Wong's. The two subsequently had a friendly fight to test their abilities. (25 July 2009). Retrieved 8 May 2010. In 1979, Wan traveled to Beijing to learn qigong from various masters of the art in order to incorporate it into his kung fu practice. The Hong Kong Police Force, in 1993, invited Wan to be Chief Wing Chun Instructor to the G4 (VIP Protection Unit). He has been the only Kung Fu master to be employed by the British Hong Kong government. Wong Shun Leung awarded Wan with his Senior Instructor Certificate in 1988. Wan worked to improve his Wing Chun, branching from his knowledge of Wong Shun Leung's style. In 1994, with Wong's consent, the style he had developed was named \\"Practical Wing Chun\\". Sifu Wan promised not to teach this style until after Wong's death, out of respect for the Wong died in 1997, and Wan subsequently opened a school for Practical Wing Chun and began teaching full-time. The school resides on Nathan Road in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The modifications were designed to maintain a modern, adaptable martial art aimed at providing self- defense against a \\"committed and real attack\\", with all of the basic tenets of traditional Wing Chun. As such, Practical Wing Chun employs the idea of using body mechanics to overcome a physically stronger opponent. This is done by adhering to five components of a strong body structure - five centerlines, relaxed shoulders, elbows pointing down, flexible wrists, and 135-degree angles. Wan is adamant about making sure the art does not become obsolete, remaining practical through constant analysis and revision of the principles and techniques. Group photo from Wan Kam Leung's first NYC SeminarIn 2008, the World Ving Tsun Athletic Association announced its inductees for the 2008 Hall of Fame. Wan Kam Leung was awarded Sifu of the Year for his hard work in propagating the art of Ving Tsun/Wing Chun. Wan has several students who have opened schools across the world, including several in Europe, Asia, Australia, and America. Wan travels and holds a seminar each year - usually in Europe - in which he demonstrates Practical Wing Chun and instructs students of the style as well as new students and students from other lineages. In May 2013 he held his first ever American open seminar in New York City, hosted by William Kwok, a closed-door disciple of Wan Kam Leung and Regional Director of the first American branch of Practical Wing Chun.

Starting his university studies in 1969, he took the four years degree in Sociology in 1973, graduating with laude with a dissertation on the role of the state in Italian post-second world war economic miracle. Because there was not yet a doctoral program in Italy in the 1970s, he got a three years scholarship (1974‚Äì1977), equivalent to a Ph.D. program, for specializing in political economy. His research concerned the place of the state and politics in the theories of classical political economists, thus published in the 1977 dissertation on ‚ÄúThinking Over the Theory of Value of Classical Political Economists‚Äù. He then got the equivalent of a four years post-doc fellowship (1977‚Äì1981) to investigate ‚ÄúThe political economy of the welfare state‚Äù, researching at the Department of Economics, Cambridge University, United Kingdom and Department of Economics at Trento University.

Regarding his main recent contributions: (1) he brought the analysis of the European Union (EU) back to the comparative framework; (2) he showed that the EU cannot be analyzed with the categories utilized for nation states; (3) he developed a more comprehensive distinction between national democracies on the basis of their functional logic and institutional structure; (4) he elaborated the original model of ‚Äòcompound democracy‚ÄôFabbrini, Sergio.

Attending Cambridge University, he was the first recipient of a studentship founded in honour of his supervisor Francis Maitland Balfour, who died in a climbing accident in 1882. Two years after graduating from Cambridge in 1880, Caldwell was appointed Demonstrator in Comparative Anatomy, working for Professor Alfred Newton. In 1884, Caldwell used his studentship, which consisted of \\"¬£200 studentship, a ¬£500 grant, the prestige and backing of the Royal Society, and letters of introduction from Newton to travel to Australia\\" to investigate whether the platypus laid eggs. With the assistance of the local Aborigines, Caldwell set up camp on the banks of the Burnett River in northern Queensland, hunting for lungfish, echidna, and platypus eggs. After extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 Aborigines, he discovered a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell famously but tersely wired London, \\"Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic.\\" That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. Caldwell stayed away from the beginning stages of Darwinism and wanted to study evolutionary patterns himself.

Life and career Born in Rome, Simonelli obtained a high school diploma in business studies, then he started working as a journalist, and even as a film critic, for the weekly magazines Avvenimento and Gente nostra. In 1928, at 22, he made his directorial debut co-directing with Nicola Fausto Neroni Maratona and two years later he was among the screenwriters of the first Italian talking film, The Song of Love by Gennaro Righelli. From 1934 Simonelli mainly devoted himself to the film editing, then, since 1940, he reprised his activity as a director specializing in comedy films of great commercial success, in which he directed some of the more popular actors of the period, including Tot√≤, Eduardo and Peppino De Filippo, Nino Taranto, Renato Rascel, Walter Chiari, Ugo Tognazzi, Macario, Alberto Sordi and Aldo Fabrizi. He concluded his career by signing many successful works interpreted by the comedy duo Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia. His last film was the western- parody Two Sons of Ringo, in which just before the end of filming he was replaced by Giuliano Carnimeo for health reasons.

History  The first year of the Finnish Championship Series was 1981, in which the championship was won by the Hawks from Helsinki. The Hawks merged with Helsingin Pallotoverit and the team won under the name Wranglers also in 1982. After the 1982 season the team changed its name to Puumat (Pumas) and has been one of the most successful clubs and the only club to remain from the 1980s; and still plays currently. Due to the recession, the 1992 season was not played, and the history of baseball can be divided between pre-1992 and post 1992. The only team outside the Helsinki Metropolitan Area to win the Finnish Championship was Riihim√§en Piraijat (Riihim√§ki Piranhas) in 1994.  League format  The season starts in early May, and is completed by the end of August or early September. Currently there are 4 teams in the top league.

In addition, Teochew boneless duck rice is a similar, but a more refined dish; due to the slightly tougher texture of duck, the duck is artfully deboned and sliced thinly for the convenience and ease of the diner, allowing the sauces to seep into the meat, making it a more pleasant experience on the whole; Hainanese chicken rice and other similar dishes have followed this style due to the popularity.

It is one of the ten dimethylnaphthalene isomers, which are derived from naphthalene by the addition of two methyl groups. 2,6-DMN is of commercial importance as a starting material for high-performance polyester fibers and films. Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) is made from the product of oxidation 2,6-DMN. Synthesis Alkylated naphthalenes (methyl-, dimethyl-, and poly-methyl naphthalenes, thus including 2,6-DMN) are found in low concentrations in crude oil and coal tar. Separation is difficult, expensive, and requires a number of operations such as selective crystallization and adsorption, in addition to any isomerization reactions. There has been a search for suitable synthetic routes to 2,6-DMN. In the \\"alkenylation process\\" butadiene (1) , o-xylene (2), and Sodium-potassium alloy (3) are used, which react to form 5-(ortho- tolyl)pent-2-ene (OTP, 3). OTP is subsequently cyclized to 1,5-dimethyltetraline (4). Dehydrogenation then provides 1,5-dimethylnaphthalene (1,5-DMN, 5). Finally, 1,5-DMN is isomerized to 2,6-DMN (6). In the final step, other mono-, di-, and tri-methylnaphthalenes are formed. More work is therefore required in separation of the mixture, which is done by selective crystallization. :Synthesis of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene by the alkenylation process Applications 2,6-Dimethylnaphthalene is mainly used for the preparation of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid by oxidation of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene in the liquid phase. 2,6-Naphthalenedicarboxylic acid is a monomer for the production of high-performance polymers, in particular poly (ethylene-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate) or shorter polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), a polyester which is stronger and has a higher thermal resistance than the frequently used polyethylene terephthalate (PET). However, 2,6-DMN is a more expensive intermediate than terephthalic acid that is used for PET.

Fleischman worked in the Baroque period of design and his roman typefaces have been described as \\"transitional\\" in style, more stylised and sharply cut than was common before. Perhaps his most notable design was his complex music font, that was later used to decorate the edges of documents, including the first bank note of the Netherlands called the \\"roodborstje\\" or robin. Biography He was born in W√∂hrd, Nuremberg, but moved to Amsterdam, where he worked for Izaak van der Putte and Hermanus Uytwerff before opening his own type foundry in 1735. Fleischman was unable to continue the type foundry on his own, and Rudolf Wetstein ran the business for him, while he continued to work for him as a punchcutter. After Rudolf died in 1742, his son Hendrik Joris Wetstein sold the company in 1743 to Izaak Ensched√© of Haarlem, forming the nucleus of the type-founding business of Joh. Ensched√©, which remained operational until 1990. Fleischman continued to live in Amsterdam and made fonts for Ensched√© as well as other Amsterdam businesses. His \\"Courant-Letter\\" face used by the Haerlemse Courant was one of the first marketed specifically for the use of newspapers; historian Harry Carter praised him as \\"a superb cutter of small types, and in refinement of design and execution his news fonts are unsurpassed\\". Fleischman apparently somewhat concentrated on smaller typefaces; the Ensched√©'s display typefaces were mostly cut by Jacques-Fran√ßois Rosart. \\"Paragon\\" (20pt) size roman and italic. Fleischman lived in Amsterdam until the end of his life, dying there in 1768. During the 1760s he contributed to a planned book on the technology of typefounding and punchcutting intended to be published by the brothers Ploos van Amstel as a Dutch response to Pierre-Simon Fournier's Manuel Typographique, which was never finished. A short manuscript attributed to Fleischman, perhaps a draft of part of this work, was acquired by a Dutch bookseller and published in 1994 with English translation. Fleischman's typefaces were received with great popularity in his lifetime and Ensched√©'s lavish type specimen \\"of 1768\\" evidently became something of a memorial to him (it is dated to 1768 on the title page, but all copies known were apparently finished the following year; Fleischman's portrait is dated 1769). John A. Lane, who has prepared an edition and commentary on it, notes that \\"Ensched√© scrupulously saved Fleischman's own account book and other documents, including even his passports, so that his career can be reconstructed in remarkable detail.\\" Fournier also thought that his work had brought \\"considerable accessions\\" to the reputation of the Ensched√© foundry. He was also commemorated by the Ploos Van Amstel Brothers' type foundry in the introduction to their specimen following his death. =Music font= When Breitkopf developed the first typeface for music in 1755, Ensched√© wanted to improve on the idea, and hired Fleischman to create a more flexible and accurate system. Soon after, the first Haarlem songbook Haerlemsche Zangen was published with this font. Previous songbooks had had their music engraved on copper plates by musicians. The new font was designed to be used by publishers in the same way that typeface could be used to print words, but this idea was not successful, as the musicians who wrote the music needed training in order to use the font. An innovative musician who used the Ensched√©-Fleischman font was Leopold Mozart for his Dutch edition of his Instructions to play the violin in 1766.Grondig onderwijs in het behandelen der viool, reprint of 1766 publication by Leopold Mozart, A. Oosthoek's uitgeversmaatschappij, 1965 His son the wunderkind played the organ in the St. Bavochurch across the street from Ensched√©'s publishing company in the same year. Posthumous reputation Flesichman's typefaces have a high x-height (large lower-case letters, following the \\"Dutch taste\\" style of the preceding century) and strong appearance on the page, and have not always been well-reviewed aesthetically. In 1777 Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf considered Fleischman one of the three greatest punchcutters of the eighteenth century alongside Fournier and John Baskerville (although in practice Baskerville's typefaces were probably cut for him by John Handy), although he was not impressed by every aspect of his aesthetic. They generally did not appeal to printers and type designers in the twentieth century, for instance receiving criticism from Daniel Berkeley Updike's influential Printing Types, and have been less commonly been revived than the work of Renaissance and early modern punchcutters such as Claude Garamond, Robert Granjon and Mikl√≥s T√≥tfalusi Kis, although 1927 revival was published supervised by Georg Belwe. Lane comments that \\"his romans lack the staid majesty and subtle curves\\" of Baskerville's delicate typefaces of the same period, and James Mosley wrote that \\"Fleischman was undoubtedly a virtuoso punchcutter, even though there is something rather arid about his hard, angular types.\\" Interest in Fleischman's work has been greater in the digital type period, and numerous digital type designs have been influenced by Fleischman's work. Several contemporary designs influenced by Fleischman have been intended for newspapers, including Hoefler & Co.'s Mercury and Fenway by Matthew Carter, son of Harry Carter. Kris Sowersby comments that \\"for all their extroverted detailing, Fleischman‚Äôs text typefaces work extraordinarily well. Even colour and efficient forms make them interesting and readable.\\" Carter, who interned at the Ensched√© type foundry as a young man, comments \\"I‚Äôve always liked Fleischmann‚Äôs faces for small sizes...I think Fleischmann was wonderful at doing those tiny faces that were very legible.\\" DTL Fleischmann, published by Dutch Type Library, is a particularly faithful digital revival of his work with optical sizes.

The Chronicle of the Morea mentions that the barony, centred on the mountain town of Karytaina, comprised twenty-two knight's fiefs.Miller (1921), pp. 71‚Äì72Bon (1969), pp. 105, 366‚Äì367 Karytaina was of particular strategic importance, as it controlled the southern part of the Skorta region and the ravine of the Alpheios valley, which was the main route from and into the central Peloponnese from the coastal plains of Elis.Bon (1969), pp. 105, 365‚Äì366 The first baron was probably Renaud of Briel (or Bri√®res), from the Champagne, who is attested in the Treaty of Sapienza in 1209. He was succeeded by his brother, Hugh of Briel, who married a daughter of Prince Geoffrey I of Villehardouin.Bon (1969), pp. 105, 367 His son and successor, Geoffrey of Briel, was the one who built the Castle of Karytaina in the middle of the century. Due to his participation in the War of the Euboeote Succession against the Prince William II of Villehardouin, and his absence from the Peloponnese in 1263‚Äì65 without authorization, as required by Achaean feudal law, he was dispossessed twice, but was each time pardoned and restored to the barony, albeit now no longer by inalienable right of conquest, but as a gift from the Prince. Geoffrey had no heirs, and on his death in 1275 the barony was split: one half remained with his widow, Isabella de la Roche, and the other reverted to the Prince's domain.Bon (1969), pp. 105‚Äì106, 367‚Äì368 Two pretenders to the barony appeared a few years later: a certain John Pestel, and Geoffrey's nephew, Geoffrey the Younger, who after much persistence managed to obtain the fief of Moraina.Bon (1969), pp. 148, 392, 700 Isabella married a second time, to Hugh, Count of Brienne, but he was more concerned of his Italian domains and spent more time there; after Isabella's death in 1279, Hugh became increasingly weary of holding a fief exposed to the incessant Byzantine raids into Arcadia.Bon (1969), pp. 149, 150, 160, 368 In 1289 he abandoned the barony and returned it to the domain in exchange for the fortress of Beauvoir (which he soon after exchanged again with John Chauderon for lands in Italy). The barony was then reconstituted in its entirety and granted by King Charles II of Naples to Isabella of Villehardouin and her husband Florent of Hainaut, at the occasion of their confirmation as Princess and Prince of Achaea.Bon (1969), pp. 161, 368 In 1303, Isabella granted the fortresses of Karytaina and Araklovon (Fr. Bucelet) to her infant daughter Margaret of Savoy, who renounced her claims in Achaea upon her marriage in 1324.Bon (1969), pp. 179, 189, 368 In 1320, Karytaina and the eastern half of the ancient barony fell into the hands of the Byzantines under Andronikos Asen. Five years later, Prince John of Gravina tried to recover the fortress, but without success.Bon (1969), pp. 202, 205, 368 Coinage Along with the Barony of Damala, Karytaina is the sole barony of Achaea known to have minted coinage in its own name: a series of billon deniers issued in the 1290s by Helena Angelina Komnene, second wife and widow of Hugh of Brienne. These were marked with the legends HELENA D[E]I GRA[TIA] and CLARICTIA S[EMI] F[EUDI DOMINA], apparently in claim of her husband's half-barony.Mallo, Preston & Seltman (1994), pp. 374‚Äì375 As A. Bon points out, however, this issue was struck with CLARICTIA and not CARITENA, and at any rate was made in her capacity as regent for the Duchy of Athens rather than as lady of Karytaina.Bon (1969), p. 87 note 4, 701 References Sources  Category:States and territories established in 1209 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1289 Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea Category:Medieval Arcadia ","title":"Barony of Karytaina"},{"id":"39781661","text":"The 1972 Monte Carlo Open was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts at the Monte Carlo Country Club in Monte Carlo, Monaco .

Historical passports included a significant numbers of details about the service. Since 2007, however, it has been issued in credit card size, contains much less detail, and cannot be modified afterwards.

Glaciers  Notable glaciated areas in this range are: Leon Huaccanan-Azuljanka, which is a plateau of 10 km. long and 2¬Ω km. wide that rises eastward, to a steep cliff in its eastern margin; a tiny ice plateau at the union of the Yarupac-Torre de Cristal ridges; and finally mount Santa Rosa which has the most of the remaining glacier ice. Permanent snow begins at about 5000m in the northern and central parts of the range.  Environmental issues  This mountain range has a bad conservation status because of mining activity in the area and the ongoing glacier retreat due to climate change. Explosions and pollution of lakes are important disturbances to the local ecosystem caused by mining activity. There are also abandoned facilities of other mining companies in the area.

It is situated about west of Windorah and east of Birdsville in the channel country close to the border with South Australia. The property is currently owned by S. Kidman & Co. and occupies an area of with a carrying capacity of 14,000 head. The traditional owners of the area the Karuwali have lived in for tens of thousands of years. Karuwali (also known as Garuwali, Dieri) is a language of far western Queensland. The Karuwali language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Diamantina Shire Council, including the localities of Betoota and Haddon Corner. The lease was first taken up, on Karuwali tribal lands, by pioneer and pastoralist John Costello in the late 1860s or early 1870s. William Barker bought Morney Plains in 1876 along with the 1,000 head of cattle it was stocked with from the Collins brothers. The property was owned by Weir and Scott in 1881 when it was visited by a journalist who described it as splendid country with hardly any grass on it simply to want for sufficient rainfall. The writer had been riding in a southerly direction along the Diamantina River and had described the area near the station as being lightly timbered stony country with large areas of saltbush and cotton bush. In 1887 the homestead was washed away following exceptionally heavy rains in the area and the heaviest flooding known at the time. In 1927 the property was acquired by Ernest Castine for ¬£27,500. Castine bought the property at auction from Coles Brothers Limited following the death of Thomas Kidman. The property occupied an area of and was stocked with 7,500 head of cattle and 200 horses and well watered by over four artesian bores. Airmail delivery to remote properties in outback South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland commenced in 1949. Morney Plains along with other remote properties including Mungerannie, Clifton Hills, Glengyle, Davenport Downs, Mulka, Mount Leonard, Durrie, Cordillo Downs, Tanbar Station, Durham Downs, Nappa Merrie, Lake Pure and Naryilco were also on the route. Craig Lasker and Nikki Smith have managed the property since 2000 after short stints at Ruby Plains Station and then Mooraberree Station, an outstation at Morney Plains. Drought struck in 2001 and continued through 2002 with the herd being reduced from 13,000 to 3,000 head of cattle. In 2003 a heavy downpour caused more damage than relief and later the same year the homestead burnt down killing the couple's two children. Despite the tragedy the couple stayed at Morney Plains and were still managing it in 2012. In 2013, the station was struck by drought again requiring water to be piped from a bore to the homestead once the water in the dams had run dry.

Facts Singh was an Indian citizen. He had married a British citizen, and the two had resided for a time in Germany before returning to live in the UK. After they returned to the UK the couple divorced, leading to the UK government removing his leave to remain. He stayed and eventually the UK government began procedures to deport him. Singh then took the case to the European Court of Justice citing EU free movement rules. Under EU law [today, Art 3(1) of the Citizens' Rights Directive], a Union citizen has the right to move to a Member State other than that of his nationality, and has the right to bring certain family members, including his non-EU national spouse, with him when he does so. Judgment It was held that EU free movement rules overrode domestic legislation and as such Singh was entitled to remain in the UK. Significance This case established a precedent for British citizens to secure UK immigration rights for their non-European spouses, who are unable to join their partners because of several changes in UK immigration law aimed at reducing net migration. Through EU Regulations on Free Movement of Peoples, it provides a window of opportunity to reunite UK citizens with their spouses in the increasing number of cases where the new rules on income and other additional measures mean that such spouses of UK citizens would otherwise be separated by the requirements of increasingly strict visa controls. The Surinder Singh route involves living and working elsewhere in the European Economic Area for a period of three or more months (there is no actual time period required by EU law but instead it is based on previous case law and its application) and then asserting the rights associated with EEA citizenship and free movement to gain access to their own country while being covered by European law. In so doing, the Surinder Singh route triggers European rights of free movement that have otherwise been removed from UK citizens by UK legislation. In principle, the Surinder Singh route applies to all EU citizens, not just UK citizens. For example, a French husband could bring his Mexican wife into France by exercising his treaty rights in Spain. It also applies to qualifying dependent family members as well as spouses. There are several petitions circulating throughout the UK and to expats abroad that are asking people to fight this recent \\"government clarification\\" and an example is 'British people want equal rights to bring their family to the UK ' on government petition website.

It is also known as Nyamgondho Wuod Ombare, Nyamgondho Kombare, and Nyamgontho. The legend of Nyamgondho centers around a poor fisherman from Kamuela in Tanzania who came to sojourn in Kachwodho clan in Nyandiwa next to the present Nyandiwa fishing beach on the Suba mainland in Kenya. Nyamgodho's name was Julu son of Ombare and the grandson of Omae. The full myth has been told in the seminal anthology of Luo oral literature \\"Keep My Words\\" by Onyango-Ogutu and Nashley Mbayah.  Story  Nyamgondho son of Ombare was a very poor man who earned a living by fishing on Lake Victoria. He barely had anything to eat or clothes to wear, and, every evening, his underprivileged conditions forced him to walk long distances looking for a place among kind neighbors to help him with a place to sleep. One morning, Nyamgondho woke up so hungry that he thought he was going to die of hunger. Thus, he went to the lake at least with a hope of getting his daily bread, as he was fishing he cast his net and upon pulling it in, he saw an ugly woman. Nyamgondho wanted to throw her back into the water, but the ugly woman persuaded him to pull her out and live with her as his wife. She promised to make him wealthy, on the condition that he never reveals to anyone where she was found. The lady of the lake was hardworking and Nyamgondho became very rich, acquiring many cattle and several other wives. However, he suddenly grew proud and arrogant and one day he came home drunk; each wife, who had her own house, refused to let him in. Even the lady of the lake refused to let him in. Nyamgondho shouted \\"What? Even you, ugly creature whom I found in the lake, you won‚Äôt open the door for me?\\" Enraged, the lady of the lake replied \\"What have you said? What was the agreement when we met?\\" Nyamgondho told her that with his considerable wealth in cattle, he no longer needed such an ugly wife and he cursed her. Upon hearing this, the lady of the lake left their home and returned to the lake and, to Nyamgondho's horror, every one of his cows followed her: one by one they walked into the water, leaving him with no possessions.  Legacy  The rock formations resembling the legendary lady of the lake's footsteps and those of her animals can be seen at the point where she entered the water in Nyandiwa Gwassi on the shores of Lake Victoria. People in the Nyanza region in Kenya believe that the water which flows above the \\"footsteps\\" has medicinal powers and they come from as far as Kisumu to collect it.

At 2:00pm, May 23, 1989, three young protesters from Liuyang, Hunan, posted banners on the wall of the Tiananmen gate's passway. The slogans on the banners read, Time to End the Five Thousand Years of Autocracy () and Time to End the Cult of Personality (). Shortly after, they threw eggs filled with pigment to the Portrait of Mao Zedong on the Tiananmen Gate. They were immediately caught by members of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation (, abbr. È´òËá™ËÅî). At 5:00pm, they were forced to appear in a press conference and admitted that their activities were totally irrelevant with Movement. At 7:00pm, they were handed to Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. On a TV program broadcast the same day, members of the Movement claim that they had nothing to do with the three youths, and criticized them. At 10:00pm, the defaced portrait of Mao Zedong was taken down and replaced by a spare. The incident The three's initial goal was to support the Beijing students. Upon their arrival in the city on May 19, they joined the students in the protest. But their ultimate aim was different from the students‚Äô. The students were mostly anti-corruption and sought reform of the party, while the three from Hunan sought to overthrow the Communist Party altogether and the installation of a democratic government. Yu Zhijian and Yu Dongyue had been sending their advice and proclamations to the student leaders, but they received no response. On May 22 the three began planning the defacement of Mao‚Äôs portrait after they saw no use talking to the students further. The next day, they bought twenty eggshells, filled them with paint, threw them at the portrait. After the vandalism, they were apprehended by the student security, and were taken to a tent for questions. The three were initially optimistic about meeting with the student leaders and telling them about the symbolic significance of their action. But the students feared that the three were government spies sent to discredit the protesters. The students, in an attempt to quickly distinguish themselves from the vandals, sent the three from Hunan to the police. After several days of interrogation, they appeared before the judge and received their respective sentences. Original perpetrators in 1989 =Yu Dongyue= Yu was a propaganda photographer in Liuyang and five years younger than his co-perpetrators Lu Decheng and Yu Zhijian. After the three were jailed, they were briefly reunited in the same prison. Yu Dongyue and Yu Zhijian urged Lu Decheng not to resist the party and to live on so that he can serve as the only one of the three to communicate with the outside world. Yu Dongyue was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He acquired schizophrenia in 1992 while in jail due to torture, and was released on commutation of sentence in February 2006. He arrived in the United States in 2009 and obtained political asylum. =Lu Decheng= Lu was a high school graduate and mechanic in Liuyang. He often felt inferior to his two friends because of his lack of education. He described his father as cowardly and generally did not have a good relationship with him throughout his life. In his earlier years prior to the student protest of 1989, Lu eloped with his wife in order to escape government and societal pressure on unlawful marriage and pregnancy. Both of whom were below the legal marital age at the time. Their child was therefore considered illegitimate. Their first child died while the second survived. Yu Zhijian and Lu were childhood friends. After Lu was sent to jail, he was seen by the party as the only one of the three who could be changed because he was less educated than his friends, for which he resisted. His wife eventually divorced him after years of faithfulness because of a misunderstanding between the two. Lu Decheng was sentenced to 16 years in jail, and released in 1998 on bail. After his release, he was approached by former student protesters, who would eventually help him escape China. He left China for Thailand in 2004, but was arrested by the local police for illegal immigration. He finally arrived in Canada on April 11, 2006, and obtained political asylum. =Yu Zhijian= Yu Zhijian was a teacher back in Hunan, he demonstrated on numerous occasions his dissatisfaction with the administration of the schools, for which he was transferred to the countryside and demoted. Upon their decision to throw eggs at the portrait, he and Yu Dongyue brought up the idea that their actions would be symbolic and would serve a greater purpose although they discussed other options: \\"We‚Äôd come all this way to Beijing, and we had to live up to our duty. Yu Dongyue was so upset and saddened that he proposed we self-immolate as a group. We came up with several plans. For example, we could stand on Gold Water Bridge, pour gasoline over ourselves and light it up. The effect was sure to be dramatic. But what goal were we trying to achieve?\\". After throwing eggs on Mao's portrait, Yu Zhijian was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released in 2009 on bail. He eventually arrived in the United States in 2009 and obtained political asylum and settled in Indianopolis where he was also taking care of Yu Dongyue, who suffers from mental illness after torture in prison. He died on March 30, 2017 in Indianopolis worried \\"that his fervent gesture would fade from minds, and that the spectre of Mao would remain\\". The Economist published his obituary on June 8, 2017. Post-1989 vandalism of the portrait At least three other incidents have occurred since the three from Hunan threw egg at Mao's portrait. The first one occurred in May 2007. The vandal's name was Gu Haiou, then a 35-year-old unemployed man from √úr√ºmqi, as reported by the official Xinhua news agency. Gu hurled a burning object at the portrait, causing partial damage. The Square was then sealed off to replace the portrait and security was tightened afterward. Neither the government nor the police gave any response to the incident and its perpetrator. It was known that Gu was detained by the police, but his current whereabouts are still unknown. The second incident occurred in April 2010. The protester was only identified as Mr. Chen by the police, who came to Beijing from Heilongjiang to raise individual and human rights issues. At early afternoon on April 5, Mr. Chen threw a plastic bottle of ink at the portrait in resonance with the 1989 incident. He was later detained by the Beijing municipal police and his current status is unknown. The third incident occurred on March 5, 2014. Protesters gathered on the square hoping to attract the attention of the annual National People‚Äôs Congress that began on March 5. Their goal was to petition the government about their grievances, though the details of their grievances were unknown. As part of the protest, an unidentified man aged around 30 threw ink on the lower left hand corner of the portrait. He was quickly detained by the police, and immediately afterward, the police had set up a 200-metre perimeter in an attempt to conceal what had taken place.

Geography Mappano is located in the northwestern area of the metropolitan area of Turin, some km in south of Turin-Caelle Airport. The municipality borders with Borgaro Torinese, Caselle Torinese, Leini, Settimo Torinese and Turin. History It was established on 30 January 2013, from territories which previously had been frazioni (hamlets) of the communes of Caselle Torinese, Borgaro Torinese, Settimo Torinese and Leini. Permanent settlements in Mappano depicted this area as the swamp of Caselle because of the properties of its soils. In the fifteenth century, Antonio de Amapano (from whom possibly originates the name) began to reclaim the territory, constructing farms in which rice was cultivated. In the sixteenth century, further intervention was undertaken with the creation of a net of irrigation canals. During the nineteenth century, the presence of drainage channels and large open spaces in the area attracted many families of washers, an activity that characterises the suburbs of Turin. The first church in Mappano was built in 1850. The settlement, in that period, consisted of a group of farms scattered along the road between Turin and Lein√¨ that did not expand significantly during the boom after the Second World War. In the 1970s, the Turin metropolitan area experienced a rapid increase in the population in the belt formed by the municipalities of the metropolitan area most distant from the centre of Turin. In a good geographical location, not far from the main city and close to major axes and connection points (the Turin-Milan motorway, the ring motorway, and the airport), the ‚Äòmappanese‚Äô territory developed during the 1980s in a fairly concentrated way around a traditional core. = Mappanese identity = The term ‚Äòidentity‚Äô sometimes criticized for its intrinsic indefinability and ambiguity is important to describe how local political actors identify themselves with a given territory. The struggle for a recognised ‚ÄòMappanese‚Äô identity is stronger than the awareness of the value of environmental resources with which the population lives, in particular the value of the soil resource.

Architect Howard Van Doren Shaw designed the building, his first design of a commercial building. Shaw's design features limestone quoins, piers, and decorations, curtain walls with cast iron spandrels on the floors housing the printing presses, and a projecting cornice. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1976. In 1985 the building was converted to residential use, and was purchased by Columbia College Chicago in 1993 as its first residence hall. Columbia sold the building in 2017 for $20 million, and continued leasing it through the 2018‚Äì19 academic year.  See also  * R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co.

The first squad of Nuenen is playing in the Sunday Hoofdklasse (5th tier) since 2016. The first women squad plays in the Hoofdklasse for women (3rd tier) since 2014 or 2015. History The club was founded in 1922 and the club colors were red and white. =1950s‚Äì1960s: The Vierde Klasse era= RKSV Nuenen started playing in the Vierde Klasse of the Royal Dutch Football Association in 1948. It changed its club colors to green and white in 1955. In the 1969 Nuenen won the championship of its Vierde Klasse and promoted to the Derde Klasse. =1970s‚Äì1980s: Derde and Vierde Klasse= After five strong seasons in the Derde Klasse, in 1976 RKSV ended 12th and found its way back to the Vierde Klasse. Five strong seasons in the Vierde Klasse followed. Another section championship in 1980 brought RKSV back to the Derde Klasse. Not for long as one year later it was back in the Vierde Klasse for another section championship, promoting once again in 1982. Nuenen continued in the Derde Klasse for the remainder of 1980s. =1990s‚Äì2000s: Tweede Klasse, above and below= As in the early seventies, by the early nineties, RKSV was once again a leading Derde Klasse team (with the exception of the weaker 1990‚Äì1991 season). As results kept improving in 1994, it grabbed its first Derde Klasse championship and found itself playing that year, for the very first time in the Tweede Klasse. In the Tweede Klasse it performed well starting from the first season, taking the section championship in 2001. In 2002 Nuenen finished 8th in the Eerste Klasse and as early as its second season it won its first Eerste Klasse championship to reach the Hoofdklasse for the very first time. Ernie Brandts coached during this foray into the Hoofdklasse. Not quite ready for the challenge, RKSV finished 13th, and went back to the Eerste Klasse in 2004. Nuenen finished 11th in the Eerste Klasse, and went back to the Tweede Klasse in 2005. Former international Jan Poortvliet started coaching the team. In the Tweede Klasse, Nuenen immediately took the championship of 2006. During the next years it played stable at usually competing for the top spots of the Eerste Klasse, also after parting ways with Jan Poortvliet in 2007. =2010s: Hoofdklasse and Eerste Klasse= In 2011 RKSV won the section championship of the Eerste Klasse and the club promoted for the second time to the Hoofdklasse. In 2012 RSKV lost 0‚Äì5 in a practice match against PSV Eindhoven. At the start of 2014 Eric Clijk became the new coach of Nuemen after it had fired Willy Scheepers on 11 November 2013. In 2014 it returned to the Eerste Klasse. Goalkeeper Kelle Roos and forward Jurik Zimmerman joined the selection. Roos left by the winter break for Derby County F.C. In fall 2015, in a Dutch national cup game, after Nuenen scored against VV Gestel from a free kick, the goalkeeper of Gestel had an argument with the referee after which he gave the referee a headbutt and was arrested. Nuenen completed this season as champion of the Eerste divisie and promoted to the Hoofdklasse for the third time in its history. In fall 2016, the Artificial turf‚Äìcancer hypothesis caused Nuenen as one of the first Dutch association football clubs temporarily not to play on its artificial turf. Playing in Hendrik-Ido- Ambacht, Nuenen beat IFC 5‚Äì1, enabling Nuenen to advance to the first place in Hoofdklasse B. RKSV ended this season in 6th place and will continue to play in the Hoofdklasse. For 2017‚Äì2018 it is strengthened by defender Tim Rerimassie, who joined from Helmond Sport and had played some of his youth at RKSV. On August 19, Nuenen is scheduled to travel to Capelle aan den IJssel for its first game in this year's National football cup of the Netherlands against vv Capelle.

It has 240 tubes making it the world's largest rocket artillery by tube count. It is thought to function as a combined form of BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher. It is developed by a joint venture between Al Jaber Land System and ROKETSAN.  Design rationale  The United Arab Emirates Army made a request for a rocket artillery battery to be mounted on one vehicle, since the army is using six vehicles, most likely BM-21 Grad, and 30 soldiers to do the same. Due to the small number of military personnel of the United Arab Emirates Army, the Multiple Cradle Launcher has an advantage over the use of six vehicles which require a team of 30 men, whereas the Multiple Cradle Launcher only needs a team of three to operate and launching the same number of rockets (240). It has four rocket launchers attached to the trailer each carrying sixty 122mm rockets. The system fires ROKETSAN 122mm T-122 Sakarya rockets fitted with a high-explosive warhead that can be detonated by using either a point detonating fuze or by a proximity fuze. The operator of the system can choose how many and which pods he fires. All rockets can be fired in under two minutes, making the rate of fire 2 rounds per second. After launching the rockets the system can relocate and continue firing rockets if it had not launched its entire payload or if it had, then be rearmed by a support vehicle in about 30 minutes. The support vehicle has two cranes each reloading two pods of the system.  Variants  ROKETSAN also developed a Rocket Launcher, which fires both 107mm and 122mm rockets from the same Launcher, making it a Multi-Calibre, Multiple Rocket Launcher. In February 2017, Al Jaber unveiled its Jobaria TCL (Twin Cradle Launcher) heavy rocket artillery system. Based on the Multiple Cradle Rocket Launcher, it fires 300 mm rockets from two four-rocket launchers; the system can fire either the Chinese A300 from or the Turkish T-300 Kasirga (Tiger) from .

The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the unity of the West Indies team itself. Sobers was captain of the \\"Rest of the World\\" team that toured England between May and August 1970 in place of the South Africa national team, whose proposed tour had been cancelled by English cricketing authorities because of apartheid. He accepted an invitation to the Rhodesian competition from Eddie Barlow, a South African member of the Rest of the World team, and arrived in Salisbury on the day of the event. To ecstatic applause from the mostly white spectators, Sobers partnered South African Test captain Ali Bacher in the tournament, and said afterwards that he had enjoyed himself, though he and Bacher had not won. Having established a personal rapport with the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, Sobers left the next day and returned home to Barbados. Many in the West Indies were appalled by Sobers' actions, and when he subsequently made positive comments about Smith, Rhodesia and white South African cricketers in press interviews and announced his intention to play more cricket in Rhodesia, the vitriol intensified, with one Antiguan newspaper branding him a \\"white black man\\". A number of prominent figures, including entire political parties, called for Sobers to be stripped of the West Indies cricket captaincy. Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham barred Sobers from Guyana, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India announced that if Sobers remained in the team, India would pull out of its upcoming tour of the West Indies. Sobers argued that as a \\"professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician\\", he had done nothing wrong. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) contemplated whether it would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s. Background Garfield Sobers, from the Caribbean island of Barbados, was widely regarded as one of the world's finest cricketers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among the best to ever play the sport. An all-rounder, he made his debut for the West Indies cricket team, the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a then-world record highest individual score of 365 runs not out during a Test match against Pakistan in 1958, and became captain of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic first-class cricket, he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing South Australia and Nottinghamshire during the 1960s and 1970s. His batting, bowling and fielding were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised. Rhodesia was an unrecognised state in southern Africa, run by a predominantly white minority government headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith. Taking exception to the UK's insistence on a set timetable for majority rule as a condition for independence, Smith's colonial administration had unilaterally declared independence in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended to sports. Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympic squads (which were racially integrated), were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The Rhodesia cricket team, for example, took part in the annual Currie Cup tournament against South African provincial sides. As world opinion hardened against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non-whites were legally barred from the South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991. The TCCB sought to recoup the lost revenues for the 1970 season by hastily organising a replacement series of matches between England and a \\"Rest of the World\\" team comprising leading cricketers from around the world. This squad, described by the leading cricket publication Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \\"one of the strongest teams ever to take the field\\", included five South Africans, five West Indians (including Sobers, as captain), two Pakistanis and a player each from Australia and India. It defeated England 4‚Äì1 over a tour lasting from late June to late August 1970. Sobers in Rhodesia alt=A photograph of Ian Smith Eddie Barlow, one of the South African members of the Rest of the World team, suggested to Sobers towards the end of the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event. Sobers was enthusiastically received in Salisbury by blacks and whites alike; he described the reception and hospitality as \\"wonderful\\" and \\"just great\\". After a few hours' rest, he made his way to Salisbury Sports Club for the competition, in which he partnered the South African Test captain Ali Bacher, whom he had never met. Sobers received ¬£600 for appearing. The largely white capacity crowd gave the Barbadian a hero's welcome, accompanying his walk out to the wicket with a standing ovation and a chorus of \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\". Having flown in just that morning, Sobers underperformed, and he and Bacher did not win. All the same, the other teams formed a guard of honour for them as they left the field. Bacher found Sobers be \\"a great guy with no airs or graces\\"; he suggested to his teammate that he should consider also playing in South Africa. Sobers spent part of the day sitting with Ian Smith in the stands. Both reported enjoying the occasion; Smith, a keen sports fan and a talented player in his day, fondly recounted his \\"lovely day discussing the great men of cricket\\" with Sobers in his memoirs, while Sobers recalled the Rhodesian premier as \\"a tremendous person to talk to\\". After the tournament ended, they continued their conversation over dinner. Smith told Sobers that he was welcome to come back to Rhodesia whenever he liked. Sobers left the next day, after less than 48 hours in the country, and returned home to Barbados on 15 September 1970. Controversy Jamaican politician alt=A photograph of Michael Manley Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an enormous and hostile press storm. \\"To say there was an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place,\\" the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as \\"a white black man\\" and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had \\"abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular\\". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he \\"may not be welcomed anywhere by people who believe that justice is bigger than even sport\\". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had \\"never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see why I should start now\\". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' \\"calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians\\". Sobers told the media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt it would be good for cricket, particularly after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so: \\"I don't know if I would want to get involved in that,\\" he said, \\"but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed.\\" Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. \\"I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician,\\" he said. \\"I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team.\\" The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham announced that Sobers would not be allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital. The Jamaica Labour Party called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later; Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, then announced that if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming tour of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no sign of an apology emanated from Sobers. Apology, resolution and legacy Taking matters into his own hands, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Eric Williams wrote an apology letter for Sobers to sign, addressed to WICB president Noel Pierce, and had it delivered to the West Indies captain by the Barbadian fast bowler Wes Hall. The letter explained that Sobers had not known of the \\"deep feelings of the West Indian people\\" on Rhodesia, that he now better understood the political issues, and that he would not go to the southern African country again. \\"I therefore wish to convey to you and the members of the board my sincere regrets for any embarrassment which my action may have caused, and to assure you of my unqualified dedication whenever I may be called upon to represent my country‚Äîthe West Indies‚Äîand my people,\\" it concluded. Sobers signed, and the apology was promptly conveyed to the WICB in late October 1970, with copies also going to the council of the West Indies Associated States and the prime ministerial offices of Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. \\"A grateful Caribbean grabbed the apology with both hands,\\" Manley records‚Äî\\"The thought that [Sobers] might be lost as a consequence of a political gaffe was intolerable. For the great majority, the incident was forgiven and promptly forgotten.\\" Sobers regained his former popularity and kept the West Indies cricket captaincy until 1972; he retired from the sport two years later. He was subsequently knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 for his services to cricket, and named one of the ten National Heroes of Barbados by the Barbadian government in 1998. His controversial visit to Rhodesia has been described by cricket journalist Siddhartha Vaidyanathan as precursoring the West Indian \\"rebel tours\\" affair of the early 1980s, in which black cricketers from the Caribbean broke the apartheid sporting boycott and played in South Africa. The West Indian rebel players became wildly popular among South African cricket fans, but were punished at home with bans from all organised cricket (initially for life, but lifted in 1989), compounded by lasting social and professional ostracism. Sobers retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport, and was reluctant to criticise the West Indians who toured South Africa. All the same, he came to regret having gone to Rhodesia because of the scandal he had provoked. \\"Had I known the furore my visit was to cause,\\" he later said, \\"I would not have gone.\\" Notes and references =Footnotes= =References= =Online sources=   =Newspaper and journal articles=   =Bibliography=   * * Category:1970 in Caribbean sport Category:1970 in Rhodesia Category:Cricket and apartheid Category:Foreign relations of Rhodesia Category:History of Barbados Category:Rhodesian cricket from 1890‚Äì91 to 1979‚Äì80 Category:Politics and sports Category:Cricket controversies Category:West Indian cricket in the 20th century Category:September 1970 sports events in Africa ","title":"Salisbury Sports Club tournament in 1970"},{"id":"39782332","text":"The following is a timeline of the history of the city of Mobile, Alabama, USA.

It was first discovered and recorded by scientists in 2009 in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, during avian influenza checks. In 2013, it was determined to be a unique species and formally described. It is a very small bird, about 10 cm long, with an orange-red tuft on its head. Discovery The Cambodian tailorbird was discovered in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, in 2009, during avian influenza checks. Since then, it has been spotted in various parts of Phnom Penh, including on a construction site where bird researcher Ashish John photographed it. His picture was later used to help describe the bird. In June 2012, John began collaborating with the Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International, the University of Kansas, Louisiana State University, and the Sam Veasna Centre to test the bird's plumage, genetics, and song. The tests determined that it was a unique species. The paper formally describing the Cambodian tailorbird was published in a special online early-view issue of the Oriental Bird Club's journal Forktail. Its specific name comes from a Khmer word which means four-faces, which describes where the bird is found: in the floodplain where the Bassac River, Mekong, and Tonl√© Sap meet. Description The Cambodian tailorbird has a tuft of orange-red feathers on its head, and black feathers on its throat. The rest of its body is light and dark gray. It is about the size of the Eurasian wren. The Cambodian tailorbird is known for its \\"loud call\\". Habitat The Cambodian tailorbird lives in a small area of dense scrubland within the floodplain of the Mekong river. The dense shrub habitat allowed it to remain undetected for so long despite living on the outskirts of a major city. It is one of two bird species endemic to Cambodia, the other being the Cambodian laughingthrush. The discoverers of the Cambodian tailorbird recommended that it be listed as \\"near threatened\\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. They said it was at risk because its habitat is declining as a result of increased urbanisation. Most newly discovered species are categorised as such.

He has abilities in the areas of hearing (Hertz-pitch that is even more precise than absolute pitch), vocal range (it is proven that he has more than 5 octaves from Ab0-C6 being one of the lowest basses in the world) and improvisation. Kayamar gained recognition from the media in 2011 when he won the 1st prize in the T-mobile's composers' competition. His stage name is derived from the anagram of his birth name (Kayamar Vorti Virgo in the full form) that is also his name in his Tolkien-like self-invented language, the kamirami. This language has grammar and concrete vocabulary, Kayamar is able to compose and speak in it. He composes and sing in the genre of jazz, classical and pop either. Early life Viktor Magyar√≥v√°ri was born in Gyula, Hungary, but spent his childhood in a small country town, called Mez≈ëhegyes. His talent has revealed soon and after a few years of special private lessons of solfege and harmonization the pianist, G√°bor Eckhardt invited him to the B√©la Bart√≥k Conservatory of Music. His parents followed him and he moved to Budapest with his family soon, at the age of 13. His first professor was G√°bor Ugrin who taught him conducting. After the voice break it revealed soon that his vocal chords are able to resonate in an extremely wide spectrum while his voice does not lose its flexibility. Although he studied classical (opera) singing for a long time, it took him more than 10 years of autodidact practising to have the total control over his capabilities. After the Conservatory he won admission to the Franz Liszt Academy of Music where he studied conducting. He never participated in official composition classes. Career =Getting on the spotlight= Windsingers performing in the Telki Festival Kayamar signed his contract with his future manager, L√°szl√≥ √Ågoston in 2011 and published his first YouTube video of a medley of his own compositions soon after. Among classical musicians this became popular fast, but they got real media attention after Kayamar's first Guinness World Record attempt on singing the lowest bass line ever. He won the 1st prize in T-mobile's composers' competition and started to perform on stage soon. The only disadvantage of this hype was that Kayamar became famous as the lowest bass of Hungary while he wanted to be successful mainly as a composer and jazz singer. =Finding his place= Kayamar was invited to perform in places like the Palace of Arts or the music festival, the Sziget. He published his first CD with his own compositions on the lyrics of the Dutch singer-songwriter Robert Keder in December, 2012. He performs alone but also with the Moltopera Company, Ren√°ta G√∂ncz and his a cappella group, the Windsingers. =The Hertz-pitch= Kayamar has a so-called logarithmic or Hertz-pitch better than the absolute pitch that is widely considered to be the highest level of musical hearing. He is able not just to identify and re-create musical notes without using a reference but he can tell how many Hertz he hears or sings. This way Kayamar is able to use much smaller intervals than quarter tones. =\\"The Hungarian Bobby McFerrin\\"= Kayamar's real speciality is the multitrack improvisation - he composes real time in multiple parts. He has composed choral works live or cooperated with guest singers but is also able to use his own voice with an instrument called looper pedal. He records and plays back the parts of a vocal or choir and improvises over it. For this unique technique he is many times compared to the American jazz a cappella vocalist and conductor Bobby McFerrin.

The spring is renowned for the beauty and sacred power of its water, which is medicinal: each arm of the spring has its own properties. In one place, the water is believed to benefit eye diseases, in another, those of the stomach, and so on. Many pilgrims and tourists visit because of their belief in the healing properties of the water, which are yet to be confirmed by scientific studies. The first records concerning the medicinal properties of the spring were studied and collected by the great traveller and geographer Shoqan Walikhanov in 1859‚Äì1865. In 1848, the English travellers Thomas Witlam Atkinson and his wife Lucy visited Qapal. He published his first article describing the spring and the nature of Qapal village in 1869 in the St. Petersburg magazine \\"Around the World\\".Nicholas Fielding, 2015: South to the Great Steppe: The Travels of Thomas and Lucy Atkinson in Eastern Kazakhstan 1847-52 The Atkinsons' son was born in Qapal and was named after the spring: Alatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson.Lucy Atkinson, 1863: Recollections of Tartar Steppes and Their Inhabitants Notes and references External links * TripAdvisor.co.uk: Tamshybulak Spring, Kapal - map and photo Category:Populated places in Almaty Region Category:Semirechye Oblast Category:Landforms of Almaty Region Category:Springs of Kazakhstan Category:Tourist attractions in Almaty Region ","title":"Qapal"},{"id":"39782543","text":"Romina Oprandi was the defending champion, having won the event in 2012, but chose not to defend her title.

By contrast, if someone dies and a funeral prayer is said on his or her behalf, no other prayer is necessary. The Hadith, or traditions of Muhammad, approve of offering funeral prayers for an absent person. Abu Hurayrah reports: \\"The Prophet informed his companions about the death of Negus (Najashi), the king of Abyssinia, the day that he died. And then the Prophet led them to the prayer ground where he lined them up and offered funeral prayer for him with four Takbirs\\".[Reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim] The time for offering a funeral prayer for an absent person should be within one month after his death. This rule is deduced from the Mursal Hadith stating that Muhammad performed a funeral prayer on the grave of a woman one month after her death, as Sayeed Ibn al-Musayyab reports: \\"Saad Bin Ubadh's mother died while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was absent. When he came to Madinah one month later, he offered the funeral prayer on her grave.\\"[Tirmizi]  Funeral prayer for the absentee  Muslim scholars have different opinions regarding the funeral prayer on the absentee. This is the opinion of a great number of eminent Muslim scholars, including Al Khattaby and Al Rawiyani. Abu Dawud in his Sunan entitled a chapter: ‚ÄúChapter of performing funeral prayer on a dead Muslim who died in a land of disbelief.‚Äù This opinion is also the belief of Ibn Taymiyah and his disciple Ibn AlQayyim. The latter said in Zad Al Mi‚Äôaad: \\"Sheikh Al Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: ‚ÄòThe right opinion is that the Muslim who died in a land where no funeral prayer was performed on him has the right to have absentee funeral prayer performed on him\\". This is similar to what Muhammad did when he heard about the death of Negus of Abyssinia, a Muslim who died in a land of Kufr where there were no Muslims to perform a funeral for him. The absentee prayer fulfills the prayer obligation so that there is no need for other prayers. = The Shaafa‚Äôis and Hanbalis = The Shaafa‚Äôis and Hanbalis believe that the funeral prayer in absentia should be held for everyone who dies away from his hometown, even if the funeral prayer is offered for him in the place where he dies. The second view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia if the deceased had benefited the Muslims in some way, such as a scholar, a mujahid or a rich man from whose wealth the people benefited, and so on. The third view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia so long as the funeral prayer has not been offered for the deceased in the place where he died. If the funeral prayer has been offered for him, then it is not prescribed to offer the funeral prayer for him in absentia. = Al-Khurshi (Maaliki) = Al-Khurshi (Maaliki) said (2/142): The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus (in absentia) is one of the things that applied only to him. Something similar was stated in Badaa‚Äôi al-Sanaa‚Äôi by al-Kasaani (Hanafi) (1/312). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo‚Äô (5/211): \\"Our view is that it is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for one died away from his home town, but Abu Haneefah disallowed it. Our evidence is the hadeeth about the Negus, which is saheeh and has no faults, and they do not have any valid answer to that.\\" Al-Shaafa‚Äôi imposed a valid restriction on offering the funeral prayer in absentia, which is that the one who offers the funeral prayer for the deceased should be one of those who would have offered the prayer for him the day he died.

The house was used as a way station on the road over Chinook Pass to Bumping Lake. It was built by prospector Dick Darlington around 1904, who named the house after a nearby rock formation. When construction of Bumping Lake Dam started in 1901, Darlington worked as a cook on the dam project, and the lodge was used as one of several way stations for supplies that were brought to the remote dam site on horse and wagon. When the road was paved in 1916 the lodge continued to serve as a stopping point for travelers. Description The Edgar Rock Lodge is a unique example for vertical log construction, using diameter logs set on end on a sill plate over a stone foundation. The 1-1/2 story house measures about n by . The house is rectangular, with a porch the full length of the main elevation, covered by a shed roof extension. The logs extend halfway up the second floor, to the bottom of the attic windows. A single dormer is set in the center of the front roof elevation. The roof is asphalt roll roofing, seamed vertically along the slope of the roof rather than shingled along its length. The porch has square posts, but the railings are logs. The log walls are exposed on the interior, with sand and cement chinking. The interior features a stone fireplace, but is otherwise plain. A nearby root cellar is included in the complex. The Edgar Rock Lodge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1996.

Originally a proposed ferry crossing replacing the Woolwich Ferry, later plans suggested either a bridge or a tunnel. It is being developed in conjunction with the Belvedere Crossing, just downriver. History The crossing was announced as a ferry route by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, in 2012 following the cancellation of the Thames Gateway Bridge, with a proposed operation date of 2017. Subsequent reports suggesting a bridge or a tunnel have put the opening date around 2025. The ferry crossing would have replaced the Woolwich Ferry, with similar operational periods (currently 6:10am to 8:00pm weekdays), given that the current ferry's infrastructure is reaching the end of its serviceable life. Capacity would have been doubled to 300 vehicles per hour in each direction. The promoters claimed that it would alleviate traffic congestion in the Woolwich area, which suffers from a mix of local and cross-ferry traffic. Alternatives In addition to the proposed ferry, TfL suggested in 2013 a bridge or a tunnel as an alternative option. This would be a two lane crossing catering for local traffic, and would not be expected to open until after 2021. This would require an additional ¬£30m of capital to service the Woolwich Ferry in the interim period. In 2015, TfL announced that the bridge or tunnel plans were more likely to go ahead, and invited the public for their views. The crossing would be tolled, and contain two lanes of traffic each way, one dedicated to buses. TfL also suggested the Docklands Light Railway could be extended to Thamesmead or Abbey Wood as part of the works. Advocacy Approximate location of the crossing's proposed route in the Thames Estuary. Both Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, and Stephen Timms, MP for East Ham, have expressed support for a bridge in this location, rather than a ferry.

He fought throughout World War I in three overseas theatres of war, rising in rank from private to colonel. He was a member of a mercantile family of Alexandria and spent much of his life in Egypt, serving as chairman of Victoria College there.Victoria College: a history revealed, Sahar Hamouda, Colin Clement ‚Äì page 136 In 1932 he held the world record for the heaviest Atlantic bluefin tuna caught with rod and line. Family background and early life Peel, a son of William Felton Peel and Sarah Edith Peel, n√©e Willoughby, daughter of General Michael Francklin Willoughby, was born at Knutsford, Cheshire, on 31 May 1884. He had thirteen brothers and sisters and was a member of the wealthy, aristocratic Peel family. He attended Arnold House School in Llanddulas, Cheltenham College and the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais in Tours. From 1902 he lived mostly in Egypt, in Alexandria. He was a keen cricketer both at college and in Egypt. Career and military service =Peel & Co.= The Peel family had established themselves as international traders in Egypt before the reign of Queen Victoria. Peel and Company, cotton and wheat merchants, traded from the major Mediterranean port of Alexandria. From 1882, Britain was the dominant power in Egypt, and the Peels had concomitant social power and responsibility. \\"Alexandria's British community, owing to its political dominance in Egypt but also to the considerable commercial success of many of its members, enjoyed a position of social prominence out of proportion to its numbers. Families like the Barkers, Peels and Carvers [...] were names to conjure with on the Cotton Exchange...\\" The Peels contributed to the foundation of Victoria College, Alexandria (now part of the Alexandria Schools Trust). By the time Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn was High Commissioner for Egypt, Peel & Co was \\"one of the biggest cotton firms of Alexandria\\". Edward Peel worked in the family firm from 1902. In 1907, his father, William Felton, was killed playing polo. Edward, his elder brother Willoughby Ewart, and his father's partner Kenneth Birley took on the family business; Edward Peel became chairman in 1908. Over time, he became a director of several commercial companies and a leading member of the British community there.It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he chaired the 1936‚Äì1937 Peel Commission into the future of Palestine. In fact the chairman was William Peel, 1st Earl Peel. =World War I= In World War I Peel served with the Wiltshire Regiment on the Western Front in France, in the Gallipoli Campaign, and with the Middle East force in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. He had a very distinguished record, being mentioned in dispatches five times and awarded the DSO and MC. From being a private in 1915 he had been promoted to lieutenant colonel by 1918; in 1919 he was awarded the Order of the Nile by the Sultan Fuad I of Egypt. =World War II and honours= During the Second World War, Peel was head of the British Community in Alexandria. On the recommendation of Sir Miles Lampson, Peel was awarded the KBE. He was knighted in 1944. He was also honoured by another government, that of Paul of Greece, King of the Hellenes, who awarded hime the Grand Officer of the Order of George I in 1947.\\"Grand Officer\\" is as reported by the London Gazette announcement. The proper title seems to be \\"Grand Commander\\". =Suez Crisis= In 1952 Peel wrote to London warning of the impossibility of maintaining a secure base on the Suez Canal; historian Philip Mansel characterises his intervention as \\"tr[ying] to instil sense in the British government\\". Peel was a close friend of Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley and wrote to advise him that 'If Anthony Eden is banking on the Egyptians not being able to run the Canal, to think again. They could do it on their heads. I have been using the canal for fifty years and the Suez Canal Company have been providing a second rate service at exorbitant prices.'Family Matter, Denys Peel, page 40 The government ignored his advice, failed to withdraw British troops, and the Suez Crisis ensued. Peel insisted on keeping Peel & Co as a British registered company and paying taxes to Britain, for he believed that the British government would help protect the company, should there be political instability. This it did not. After the Suez crisis, President Nassar confiscated the company and its assets and expelled Peel and his family from Egypt. In 1958 Peel produced a report for the government on protecting British property in Egypt which was accepted but not acted upon. Peel was one of the main protagonists in the effort to secure adequate compensation for the British residents who lost their all. Killearn states that Peel was 'foremost in pressing the claims of the \\"small man\\" in priority to the larger claimants of who he was, of course, one of the biggest in the class of private firms'.The Times, 26 September 1961 Personal life In 1923 he married Fran√ßoise Nora de Revi√®re.Fran√ßoise Nora de Revi√®re (1887‚Äì1953), second daughter of Francis de Revi√®re Peel became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1933, proposed by Field-Marshal Lord Allenby, and was vice-president of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. =Big-game tunny fishing= Peel was keenly interested in marine biology and he provided his yacht and gave assistance to Frederick Russell in investigating the movements of tunny off the east coast of Britain. Although local fishermen considered there had been no tunny before World War I, the studies suggested that migration into the North Sea had not been recent. (Abstract ) There are photographs of Peel and Russell engaged on this study. In 1934, together with Richard Kindersley, he took out a patent for a fishing reel. It incorporated a frictional braking device which allowed big-game fish to pull out the line under strong tension, while leaving the line free during baiting, etc. Following a catch off the Yorkshire coast of a large Atlantic bluefin tuna in 1929 (the fish were called \\"tunny\\" in Britain at the time), big-game tunny fishing in Britain became fashionable from 1930. Scarborough was the centre of attraction and the town was transformed into a resort for the wealthy who fished from their yachts. Magazines published many sensational stories covering the personalities and the yachts that sailed to Scarborough. A gentlemen's club, the British Tunny Club, was founded there in 1933 and Peel was their first president. In the season, which was August and September, Peel sailed with his \\"huge steam yacht\\" St George with an \\"exotic Sudanese crew\\" and in 1932 he landed a world-record tunny of , capturing the record by over from a tuna caught off Nova Scotia by American champion Zane Grey. In 1950, when North Sea tunny were declining, Peel nevertheless caught a specimen. Much of Mark Ross's book The Glory Days of the Giant Scarborough Tunny is dedicated to Peel's fishing. Death Peel died at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London on 6 September 1961. His memorial service was held at the Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, London. Lord Killearn, former ambassador to Egypt, wrote an obituary of Peel, which was published in The Times, 26 September 1961. Killearn describes Peel as 'an outstanding character excelling at work as at play, a first class shot, a fine cricketer and golfer, a good tennis played who navigated his own yacht the S.S. St. George of 500 tons' and says that the distressing miscarriage of the Suez crisis resulting in the expulsion and ruin of the British community in 1956 broke Peel's heart and hastened his death.

This concept extends the idea of a function of a real variable to several variables. The \\"input\\" variables take real values, while the \\"output\\", also called the \\"value of the function\\", may be real or complex. However, the study of the complex valued functions may be easily reduced to the study of the real valued functions, by considering the real and imaginary parts of the complex function; therefore, unless explicitly specified, only real valued functions will be considered in this article. The domain of a function of n variables is the subset of for which the function is defined. As usual, the domain of a function of several real variables is supposed to contain an open subset of . General definition A real-valued function of real variables is a function that takes as input real numbers, commonly represented by the variables , for producing another real number, the value of the function, commonly denoted . For simplicity, in this article a real-valued function of several real variables will be simply called a function. To avoid any ambiguity, the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified. Some functions are defined for all real values of the variables (one says that they are everywhere defined), but some other functions are defined only if the value of the variable are taken in a subset of , the domain of the function, which is always supposed to contain an open subset of . In other words, a real-valued function of real variables is a function :f: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} such that its domain is a subset of that contains an open set. An element of being an -tuple (usually delimited by parentheses), the general notation for denoting functions would be . The common usage, much older than the general definition of functions between sets, is to not use double parentheses and to simply write . It is also common to abbreviate the -tuple by using a notation similar to that for vectors, like boldface , underline , or overarrow . This article will use bold. A simple example of a function in two variables could be: : V : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} : X = \\\\\\\\{ (A,h) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\mid A>0, h> 0 \\\\\\\\} : V(A,h) = \\\\frac{1}{3}A h which is the volume of a cone with base area and height measured perpendicularly from the base. The domain restricts all variables to be positive since lengths and areas must be positive. For an example of a function in two variables: : z : \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} : z(x,y) = ax + by where and are real non-zero constants. Using the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, where the xy plane is the domain and the z axis is the codomain , one can visualize the image to be a two-dimensional plane, with a slope of in the positive x direction and a slope of in the positive y direction. The function is well-defined at all points in . The previous example can be extended easily to higher dimensions: : z : \\\\mathbb{R}^p \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} : z(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots, x_p) = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\\\cdots + a_p x_p for non-zero real constants , which describes a -dimensional hyperplane. The Euclidean norm: :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\ = \\\\sqrt{x_1^2 + \\\\cdots + x_n^2} is also a function of n variables which is everywhere defined, while :g(\\\\boldsymbol{x})=\\\\frac{1}{f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})} is defined only for . For a non-linear example function in two variables: : z : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} :X = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\, : \\\\, x^2 + y^2 \\\\leq 8 \\\\, , \\\\, x eq 0 \\\\, , \\\\, y eq 0 \\\\\\\\} :z(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2xy}\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} which takes in all points in , a disk of radius \\"punctured\\" at the origin in the plane , and returns a point in . The function does not include the origin , if it did then would be ill-defined at that point. Using a 3d Cartesian coordinate system with the xy plane as the domain , and the z axis the codomain , the image can be visualized as a curved surface. The function can be evaluated at the point in : :z(2,\\\\sqrt{3}) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\sqrt{(2)^2 + (\\\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\sqrt{7} \\\\,, However, the function couldn't be evaluated at, say :(x,y) = (65,\\\\sqrt{10}) \\\\, \\\\Rightarrow \\\\, x^2 + y^2 = (65)^2 + (\\\\sqrt{10})^2 > 8 since these values of and do not satisfy the domain's rule. =Image= The image of a function is the set of all values of when the -tuple runs in the whole domain of . For a continuous (see below for a definition) real-valued function which has a connected domain, the image is either an interval or a single value. In the latter case, the function is a constant function. The preimage of a given real number is called a level set. It is the set of the solutions of the equation . =Domain= The domain of a function of several real variables is a subset of that is sometimes, but not always, explicitly defined. In fact, if one restricts the domain of a function to a subset , one gets formally a different function, the restriction of to , which is denoted . In practice, it is often (but not always) not harmful to identify and , and to omit the subscript . Conversely, it is sometimes possible to enlarge naturally the domain of a given function, for example by continuity or by analytic continuation. Moreover, many functions are defined in such a way that it is difficult to specify explicitly their domain. For example, given a function , it may be difficult to specify the domain of the function g(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = 1/f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}). If is a multivariate polynomial, (which has \\\\R^n as a domain), it is even difficult to test whether the domain of is also \\\\R^n. This is equivalent to test whether a polynomial is always positive, and is the object of an active research area (see Positive polynomial). =Algebraic structure= The usual operations of arithmetic on the reals may be extended to real-valued functions of several real variables in the following way: * For every real number , the constant function ::(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\mapsto r :is everywhere defined. * For every real number and every function , the function: ::rf:(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\mapsto rf(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) :has the same domain as (or is everywhere defined if ). * If and are two functions of respective domains and such that contains an open subset of , then ::f\\\\,g:(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\mapsto f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\,g(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) :and ::f\\\\,g:(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\mapsto f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\,g(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) :are functions that have a domain containing . It follows that the functions of } variables that are everywhere defined and the functions of variables that are defined in some neighbourhood of a given point both form commutative algebras over the reals (-algebras). This is a prototypical example of a function space. One may similarly define :1/f:(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\mapsto 1/f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), which is a function only if the set of the points in the domain of such that contains an open subset of . This constraint implies that the above two algebras are not fields. =Univariable functions associated with a multivariable function= One can easily obtain a function in one real variable by giving a constant value to all but one of the variables. For example, if is a point of the interior of the domain of the function , we can fix the values of to respectively, to get a univariable function :x \\\\mapsto f(x, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n), whose domain contains an interval centered at . This function may also be viewed as the restriction of the function to the line defined by the equations , for . Other univariable functions may be defined by restricting to any line passing through . These are the functions :x \\\\mapsto f(a_1+c_1 x, a_2+c_2 x, \\\\ldots, a_n+c_n x), where the are real numbers that are not all zero. In next section, we will show that, if the multivariable function is continuous, so are all these univariable functions, but the converse is not necessarily true. =Continuity and limit= Until the second part of 19th century, only continuous functions were considered by mathematicians. At that time, the notion of continuity was elaborated for the functions of one or several real variables a rather long time before the formal definition of a topological space and a continuous map between topological spaces. As continuous functions of several real variables are ubiquitous in mathematics, it is worth to define this notion without reference to the general notion of continuous maps between topological space. For defining the continuity, it is useful to consider the distance function of , which is an everywhere defined function of real variables: :d(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\boldsymbol{y})=d(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n)=\\\\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+\\\\cdots +(x_n-y_n)^2} A function is continuous at a point which is interior to its domain, if, for every positive real number , there is a positive real number such that for all such that . In other words, may be chosen small enough for having the image by of the ball of radius centered at contained in the interval of length centered at . A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point of its domain. If a function is continuous at , then all the univariate functions, that are obtained by fixing all the variables but one at the value , are continuous at . The converse is false; this means that all these univariate functions may be continuous for a function that is not continuous at . For an example, consider the function such that , and is otherwise defined by :f(x,y) = \\\\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}. The functions and are both constant and equal to zero, and are therefore continuous. The function is not continuous at , because, if and , we have , even if is very small. Although not continuous, this function has the further property that all the univariate functions obtained by restricting it to a line passing through are also continuous. In fact, we have : f(x, \\\\lambda x) =\\\\frac{\\\\lambda x}{x^2+\\\\lambda^2} for . The limit of a real-valued function of several real variables is as follows. Let be a point in topological closure of the domain of the function . The function, has a limit when tends toward , denoted :L = \\\\lim_{\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\rightarrow \\\\boldsymbol{a}} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}), if the following condition is satisfied: For every positive real number , there is a positive real number such that :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) - L < \\\\varepsilon for all in the domain such that :d(\\\\boldsymbol{x}, \\\\boldsymbol{a})< \\\\delta. If the limit exists, it is unique. If is in the interior of the domain, the limit exists if and only if the function is continuous at . In this case, we have :f(\\\\boldsymbol{a}) = \\\\lim_{\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\rightarrow \\\\boldsymbol{a}} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}). When is in the boundary of the domain of , and if has a limit at , the latter formula allows to \\"extend by continuity\\" the domain of to . Symmetry A symmetric function is a function that is unchanged when two variables and are interchanged: :f(\\\\ldots, x_i,\\\\ldots,x_j,\\\\ldots) = f(\\\\ldots, x_j,\\\\ldots,x_i,\\\\ldots) where and are each one of . For example: :f(x,y,z,t) = t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 is symmetric in since interchanging any pair of leaves unchanged, but is not symmetric in all of , since interchanging with or or gives a different function. Function composition Suppose the functions :\\\\xi_1 = \\\\xi_1(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n), \\\\quad \\\\xi_2 = \\\\xi_2(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n), \\\\ldots \\\\xi_m = \\\\xi_m(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n), or more compactly , are all defined on a domain . As the -tuple varies in , a subset of , the -tuple varies in another region a subset of . To restate this: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\xi} : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\Xi . Then, a function of the functions defined on , :\\\\zeta : \\\\Xi \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}, :\\\\zeta = \\\\zeta(\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\xi_m), is a function composition defined on , in other terms the mapping :\\\\zeta : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} , :\\\\zeta = \\\\zeta(\\\\xi_1,\\\\xi_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\xi_m) = f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n). Note the numbers and do not need to be equal. For example, the function :f(x,y) = e^{xy}[\\\\sin 3(x-y) - \\\\cos 2(x+y)] defined everywhere on can be rewritten by introducing :(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma ) = (\\\\alpha(x,y), \\\\beta(x,y) , \\\\gamma(x,y) ) = ( xy , x-y, x+y ) which is also everywhere defined in to obtain :f(x,y) = \\\\zeta(\\\\alpha(x,y),\\\\beta(x,y),\\\\gamma(x,y)) = \\\\zeta(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = e^\\\\alpha[\\\\sin (3\\\\beta) - \\\\cos (2\\\\gamma)] \\\\,. Function composition can be used to simplify functions, which is useful for carrying out multiple integrals and solving partial differential equations. Calculus Elementary calculus is the calculus of real-valued functions of one real variable, and the principal ideas of differentiation and integration of such functions can be extended to functions of more than one real variable; this extension is multivariable calculus. =Partial derivatives= Partial derivatives can be defined with respect to each variable: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_2} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots x_n)\\\\,,\\\\ldots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_n} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n). Partial derivatives themselves are functions, each of which represents the rate of change of parallel to one of the axes at all points in the domain (if the derivatives exist and are continuous‚Äîsee also below). A first derivative is positive if the function increases along the direction of the relevant axis, negative if it decreases, and zero if there is no increase or decrease. Evaluating a partial derivative at a particular point in the domain gives the rate of change of the function at that point in the direction parallel to a particular axis, a real number. For real-valued functions of a real variable, , its ordinary derivative is geometrically the gradient of the tangent line to the curve at all points in the domain. Partial derivatives extend this idea to tangent hyperplanes to a curve. The second order partial derivatives can be calculated for every pair of variables: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2_1} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x_1 x_2} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots x_n)\\\\,,\\\\ldots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2_n} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) . Geometrically, they are related to the local curvature of the function's image at all points in the domain. At any point where the function is well-defined, the function could be increasing along some axes, and/or decreasing along other axes, and/or not increasing or decreasing at all along other axes. This leads to a variety of possible stationary points: global or local maxima, global or local minima, and saddle points‚Äîthe multidimensional analogue of inflection points for real functions of one real variable. The Hessian matrix is a matrix of all the second order partial derivatives, which are used to investigate the stationary points of the function, important for mathematical optimization. In general, partial derivatives of higher order have the form: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^p}{\\\\partial x_1^{p_1}\\\\partial x_2^{p_2}\\\\ldots\\\\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p_1}}{\\\\partial x_1^{p_1}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p_2}}{\\\\partial x_2^{p_2}} \\\\cdots \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{p_n}}{\\\\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) where are each integers between and such that , using the definitions of zeroth partial derivatives as identity operators: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^0}{\\\\partial x_1^0}f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\ldots \\\\frac{\\\\partial^0}{\\\\partial x_n^0}f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)=f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,. The number of possible partial derivatives increases with , although some mixed partial derivatives (those with respect to more than one variable) are superfluous, because of the symmetry of second order partial derivatives. This reduces the number of partial derivatives to calculate for some . =Multivariable differentiability= A function is differentiable in a neighborhood of a point if there is an -tuple of numbers dependent on in general, , so that: :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\\\\boldsymbol{a}) + \\\\boldsymbol{A}(\\\\boldsymbol{a})\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a}) + \\\\alpha(\\\\boldsymbol x)\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a} where as . This means that if is differentiable at a point , then is continuous at , although the converse is not true - continuity in the domain does not imply differentiability in the domain. If is differentiable at then the first order partial derivatives exist at and: :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\boldsymbol{a}} = A_i (\\\\boldsymbol{a}) for , which can be found from the definitions of the individual partial derivatives, so the partial derivatives of exist. Assuming an -dimensional analogue of a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, these partial derivatives can be used to form a vectorial linear differential operator, called the gradient (also known as \\"nabla\\" or \\"del\\") in this coordinate system: : abla f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_n} \\\\right) f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) used extensively in vector calculus, because it is useful for constructing other differential operators and compactly formulating theorems in vector calculus. Then substituting the gradient (evaluated at with a slight rearrangement gives: :f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) - f(\\\\boldsymbol{a})= abla f(\\\\boldsymbol{a})\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a}) + \\\\alpha \\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{a} where denotes the dot product. This equation represents the best linear approximation of the function at all points within a neighborhood of . For infinitesimal changes in and as : :df = \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}}dx_1 + \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}}dx_2 + \\\\cdots \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\\\partial x_n}\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}}dx_n = abla f(\\\\boldsymbol{a}) \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{x} which is defined as the total differential, or simply differential, of , at . This expression corresponds to the total infinitesimal change of , by adding all the infinitesimal changes of in all the directions. Also, can be construed as a covector with basis vectors as the infinitesimals in each direction and partial derivatives of as the components. Geometrically is perpendicular to the level sets of , given by which for some constant describes an -dimensional hypersurface. The differential of a constant is zero: :df = ( abla f) \\\\cdot d \\\\boldsymbol{x} = 0 in which is an infinitesimal change in in the hypersurface , and since the dot product of and is zero, this means is perpendicular to . In arbitrary curvilinear coordinate systems in dimensions, the explicit expression for the gradient would not be so simple - there would be scale factors in terms of the metric tensor for that coordinate system. For the above case used throughout this article, the metric is just the Kronecker delta and the scale factors are all 1. =Differentiability classes= If all first order partial derivatives evaluated at a point in the domain: :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}}\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_2} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}}\\\\,,\\\\ldots, \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_n} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}} exist and are continuous for all in the domain, has differentiability class . In general, if all order partial derivatives evaluated at a point : :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial^p}{\\\\partial x_1^{p_1}\\\\partial x_2^{p_2}\\\\ldots\\\\partial x_n^{p_n}} f(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\right_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{a}} exist and are continuous, where , and are as above, for all in the domain, then is differentiable to order throughout the domain and has differentiability class . If is of differentiability class , has continuous partial derivatives of all order and is called smooth. If is an analytic function and equals its Taylor series about any point in the domain, the notation denotes this differentiability class. =Multiple integration= Definite integration can be extended to multiple integration over the several real variables with the notation; :\\\\int_{R_n} \\\\cdots \\\\int_{R_2} \\\\int_{R_1} f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\, dx_1 dx_2\\\\cdots dx_n \\\\equiv \\\\int_R f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) \\\\, d^n\\\\boldsymbol{x} where each region is a subset of or all of the real line: :R_1 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\,, \\\\quad R_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\,, \\\\ldots , R_n \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}, and their Cartesian product gives the region to integrate over as a single set: :R = R_1 \\\\times R_2 \\\\times \\\\ldots R_n \\\\,,\\\\quad R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\,, an -dimensional hypervolume. When evaluated, a definite integral is a real number if the integral converges in the region of integration (the result of a definite integral may diverge to infinity for a given region, in such cases the integral remains ill-defined). The variables are treated as \\"dummy\\" or \\"bound\\" variables which are substituted for numbers in the process of integration. The integral of a real-valued function of a real variable with respect to has geometric interpretation as the area bounded by the curve and the -axis. Multiple integrals extend the dimensionality of this concept: assuming an -dimensional analogue of a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, the above definite integral has the geometric interpretation as the -dimensional hypervolume bounded by and the axes, which may be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the function being integrated (if the integral is convergent). While bounded hypervolume is a useful insight, the more important idea of definite integrals is that they represent total quantities within space. This has significance in applied mathematics and physics: if is some scalar density field and are the position vector coordinates, i.e. some scalar quantity per unit n-dimensional hypervolume, then integrating over the region gives the total amount of quantity in . The more formal notions of hypervolume is the subject of measure theory. Above we used the Lebesgue measure, see Lebesgue integration for more on this topic. =Theorems= With the definitions of multiple integration and partial derivatives, key theorems can be formulated, including the fundamental theorem of calculus in several real variables (namely Stokes' theorem), integration by parts in several real variables, the symmetry of higher partial derivatives and Taylor's theorem for multivariable functions. Evaluating a mixture of integrals and partial derivatives can be done by using theorem differentiation under the integral sign. =Vector calculus= One can collect a number of functions each of several real variables, say :y_1 = f_1(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,,\\\\quad y_2 = f_2(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)\\\\,,\\\\ldots, y_m = f_m(x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots x_n) into an -tuple, or sometimes as a column vector or row vector, respectively: :(y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_m) \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n)  f_2(x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots x_n)  \\\\vdots  f_m(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) & f_2(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) & \\\\cdots & f_m(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} all treated on the same footing as an -component vector field, and use whichever form is convenient. All the above notations have a common compact notation . The calculus of such vector fields is vector calculus. For more on the treatment of row vectors and column vectors of multivariable functions, see matrix calculus. Implicit functions A real-valued implicit function of several real variables is not written in the form \\"\\". Instead, the mapping is from the space to the zero element in (just the ordinary zero 0): :\\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and :\\\\phi(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n, y) = 0 is an equation in all the variables. Implicit functions are a more general way to represent functions, since if: :y=f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) then we can always define: : \\\\phi(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n, y) = y - f(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = 0 but the converse is not always possible, i.e. not all implicit functions have an explicit form. For example, using interval notation, let : \\\\phi : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} : \\\\phi(x,y,z) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{c}\\\\right)^2 - 1 = 0 : X = [-a,a] \\\\times [-b,b] \\\\times [-c,c] = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y,z) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\,:\\\\, -a\\\\leq x\\\\leq a, -b\\\\leq y\\\\leq b, -c\\\\leq z\\\\leq c \\\\\\\\}\\\\,. Choosing a 3-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinate system, this function describes the surface of a 3D ellipsoid centered at the origin with constant semi-major axes , along the positive x, y and z axes respectively. In the case , we have a sphere of radius centered at the origin. Other conic section examples which can be described similarly include the hyperboloid and paraboloid, more generally so can any 2D surface in 3D Euclidean space. The above example can be solved for , or ; however it is much tidier to write it in an implicit form. For a more sophisticated example: : \\\\phi : \\\\mathbb{R}^4 \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} : \\\\phi(t,x,y,z) = C tz e^{tx-yz} + A \\\\sin(3\\\\omega t) \\\\left(x^2z - B y^6\\\\right) = 0 for non-zero real constants , this function is well-defined for all , but it cannot be solved explicitly for these variables and written as \\"\\", \\"\\", etc. The implicit function theorem of more than two real variables deals with the continuity and differentiability of the function, as follows. Let be a continuous function with continuous first order partial derivatives, and let œï evaluated at a point be zero: :\\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{a}, b) = 0; and let the first partial derivative of with respect to evaluated at be non-zero: :\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},y)}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right_{(\\\\boldsymbol{x},y) = (\\\\boldsymbol{a},b)} eq 0 . Then, there is an interval containing , and a region containing , such that for every in there is exactly one value of in satisfying , and is a continuous function of so that . The total differentials of the functions are: :dy=\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x_1}dx_1 + \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x_2}dx_2 + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x_n}dx_n ; :d\\\\phi=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_1}dx_1 + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_2}dx_2 + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_n}dx_n + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial y}dy . Substituting into the latter differential and equating coefficients of the differentials gives the first order partial derivatives of with respect to in terms of the derivatives of the original function, each as a solution of the linear equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial y}\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x_i} = 0 for . Complex-valued function of several real variables A complex-valued function of several real variables may be defined by relaxing, in the definition of the real-valued functions, the restriction of the codomain to the real numbers, and allowing complex values. If is such a complex valued function, it may be decomposed as :f(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n)=g(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n)+ih(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n), where and are real-valued functions. In other words, the study of the complex valued functions reduces easily to the study of the pairs of real valued functions. This reduction works for the general properties. However, for an explicitly given function, such as: : z(x,y,\\\\alpha,a,q) = \\\\frac{q}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left[\\\\ln(x+iy- ae^{i\\\\alpha}) - \\\\ln(x+iy + ae^{-i\\\\alpha})\\\\right] the computation of the real and the imaginary part may be difficult. Applications Multivariable functions of real variables arise inevitably in engineering and physics, because observable physical quantities are real numbers (with associated units and dimensions), and any one physical quantity will generally depend on a number of other quantities. =Examples of real-valued functions of several real variables= Examples in continuum mechanics include the local mass density of a mass distribution, a scalar field which depends on the spatial position coordinates (here Cartesian to exemplify), , and time : :\\\\rho = \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\rho(x,y,z,t) Similarly for electric charge density for electrically charged objects, and numerous other scalar potential fields. Another example is the velocity field, a vector field, which has components of velocity that are each multivariable functions of spatial coordinates and time similarly: :\\\\mathbf{v} (\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y,z,t) = [v_x(x,y,z,t), v_y(x,y,z,t), v_z(x,y,z,t)] Similarly for other physical vector fields such as electric fields and magnetic fields, and vector potential fields. Another important example is the equation of state in thermodynamics, an equation relating pressure , temperature , and volume of a fluid, in general it has an implicit form: :f(P, V, T) = 0 The simplest example is the ideal gas law: :f(P, V, T) = PV - nRT = 0 where is the number of moles, constant for a fixed amount of substance, and the gas constant. Much more complicated equations of state have been empirically derived, but they all have the above implicit form. Real-valued functions of several real variables appear pervasively in economics. In the underpinnings of consumer theory, utility is expressed as a function of the amounts of various goods consumed, each amount being an argument of the utility function. The result of maximizing utility is a set of demand functions, each expressing the amount demanded of a particular good as a function of the prices of the various goods and of income or wealth. In producer theory, a firm is usually assumed to maximize profit as a function of the quantities of various goods produced and of the quantities of various factors of production employed. The result of the optimization is a set of demand functions for the various factors of production and a set of supply functions for the various products; each of these functions has as its arguments the prices of the goods and of the factors of production. =Examples of complex-valued functions of several real variables= Some \\"physical quantities\\" may be actually complex valued - such as complex impedance, complex permittivity, complex permeability, and complex refractive index. These are also functions of real variables, such as frequency or time, as well as temperature. In two-dimensional fluid mechanics, specifically in the theory of the potential flows used to describe fluid motion in 2d, the complex potential :F(x,y,\\\\ldots) = \\\\varphi(x,y,\\\\ldots) + i\\\\psi(x,y,\\\\ldots) is a complex valued function of the two spatial coordinates and , and other real variables associated with the system. The real part is the velocity potential and the imaginary part is the stream function. The spherical harmonics occur in physics and engineering as the solution to Laplace's equation, as well as the eigenfunctions of the z-component angular momentum operator, which are complex-valued functions of real-valued spherical polar angles: :Y^m_\\\\ell = Y^m_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction is necessarily complex-valued, but is a function of real spatial coordinates (or momentum components), as well as time : :\\\\Psi = \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},t) = \\\\Psi(x,y,z,t)\\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\Phi = \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{p},t) = \\\\Phi(p_x,p_y,p_z,t) where each is related by a Fourier transform.

It is located at a distance of about 100 km (driving distance) from the state capital, Bangalore.  Geography  Benavara is located at +12¬∞ 50' 23.95\\" N, +76¬∞ 56' 2.96\\" E at an altitude of 780 meters above the mean sea level. It is in the Simsha basin of Cauvery River in the southern border of Tumkur District; a plain area with a hillock in it called Thimmappana betta atop the hill adored by Lord Thimmappa with a small temple built in Hosyala style in 15th or 16th century but, rebuilt in its original style in 2007-08. It is nestled in between the Taluks Gubbi to north, Magadi to east, Maddur to south and Nagamangala to west. Nearby towns include Amruthur, Huliyurdurga, Maddur, Mandya and Nagamangala; and nearby famous religious institutions like Yediyur Siddlingeswara temple/ Mutt and Sri Adichunchanagiri Mutt.  Transportation.  Benavara village is connected by PMGSY road to State Highway No. 84 between Tumkur and Mandya via Amruthur and Kunigal. SH 84 was upgraded in to double road connecting NH.48 near Yadiyur and to Mandya via Amruthuru in 2018 improving the connectivity to neighbouring villages and cities. NH 48 between Bangalore and Hassan is 25 km from the village. The village has frequent bus services from Kunigal, Magadi, Negamangala, Mandya, Bangalore, Tumkur and Mysore. The village is 100 km from Bangalore and 90 km from Mysore. The railway line between Hassan and Bangalore passes through Yediyur and Kunigal and a station has been planned at Yedyur which is 15 km from Benavara. The Railway line is operational since 2018.  Economy  Benavara is in the command area of Markonahalli Reservoir built across Shimsha River at the confluence of Rivers Shimsha and Bellur at Markonahalli in Kunigal Tq in the 1940s; till then it was dry belt dependent on scanty rains. Now, most of the lands are irrigated assured with water from further connection to a bigger reservoir across Hemavati River. The economy is predominantly agrarian with paddy as main crop supplemented by ragi (millet) crop as staple food as well as commercial crop. There are coconut and arecanut plantations in small patches dotting the village. Due to frequent failure of rains and non assurance of regular water from Markonahalli dam to fields, farmers go for bore-wells and end with despair due to the stony under ground strata of the earth that do not yield ground water in bore wells in 3/4th area of the village and uncertain electricity in rural areas. Now, the farmers depend mainly on monsoon rains for water to the Markonahalli dam and to crops, since Hemavathi waters is not assured as planned due to many reasons in spite of the efforts of GoK. Animal husbandry like rearing of sheep and goats is economical in small scale along with rearing of draught animals for use in agriculture is the second occupation of the farming community in the village. The mechanization of agriculture is yet take off in this area and the village except tractor for ploughing/ transportation and machines for trashing of paddy. Machines for sowing, transplanting, weeding, spraying of pesticides and harvest etc. are yet to invade this area.  Demography and education  Benavara is a village with about 100 houses with population of around 500 due to migration of most of the youths to cities mostly to Bangalore on jobs in government service and in private firms since the agriculture is not remunerative. One or the other from each house is in Benaglore either for earning or for education. There is a hamlet called Benavara Koppalu attached to this village right on the SH 84, about 1 km away from the main village. Bettada Timmappa devotees This village has a reputation of having a govt primary school since pre-independence compare to neighbour villages, but, still remains with the same school. There were literates in the village among the generation of the 1900s. Anganavadi (a nursery) is the only addition since the 1970s due to limitation in population. The Govt. Middle School, at adjoining Hanchipura was only the school after Independence for higher primary education till such time only 3 students went out to pursue education in Tumkur and happened to join govt service in the 1950s. Then, a H S was opened in 1963 at Yedavani till then students had to go out to cities/ towns for high schools. Since the 2000s there is a High School at Valagerepura close to the village and Junior college at Amruthur and degree college at Kunigal with a lot of bus facilities. There are graduates from this village since the 1960s and now (2010s), it hosts a number of degree and PG graduates from this village. The children of the officials of this village are in good positions after good education in engineering/ medical fields. There are two Dy. Conservator of Forests (Rtd) from this village; Sri B.M.T. Rajeev, IFS is one among them and he is a freelance writer and has authored/ published three books on wildlife/ forestry. Another DFO was B.K Mayanna who is retired now. This village had the blessings/ guidance of the reputed social workers/ politicians/educationists hailed from the adjoining village M A colony late H M Gangadharaiah, MLC the founder of Siddhartha Engg and Medical colleges, Tumkur in the 1950s and Late M H Jayaprakash Mayayan, MLA and founder of Dr Ambedkar Engg College, Bengaluru from 1967 to 1994; who did their best to guide the villagers in the field of importance of education and its importance in social, economical and political upliftment through it.  Climate, flora and fauna  Climatically Benavara falls in dry weather zone, where the rainfall is about 400 mm from both the monsoons. The SW monsoon is always low with some showers in May‚ÄìJune since the village is in rain shadow area. It receives some good showers from NE monsoon in September‚ÄìNovember. The temperature goes up to 38 ¬∞C in summer and falls to 15 ¬∞C in winter. Droughts are common, but not experienced much due to the irrigation facility available from Markonahalli dam. Flora: The vegetation of the village is dry deciduous stunted growth with lofty trees like bevu, arali, basari, goni, mavu, honge, gobali, tabasi, halasu, hunase, and bidiru in cultivated fields. The common natural undergrowths are Haale, kare, chittunde, mundagalli, ekka, tumbe, tangadi, and bandarike with variety of grasses palatable to the cattle. The exotic weeds like Eupatorium and parthenium are invading the area through the waters of Hemavathi since the 2010s and looks menacing affecting the farming and the fodder source of cattle. Lantana is also common The Ipomia weed in water bodies is also menacing affecting the quality of water. Fauna of the village is interesting, one can see jackal and wild boar if he is lucky in the early mornings near the hillock. Mongoose, squirrel, hare, rats, blandy coot are common. Reptiles seen are cobra, water snake, green snake, viper, monitor lizard, varieties of lizards, chamelian etc., varieties of frogs, fishes also common. Birds seen are brahminy kite, pariah kite, vultures have become rare, pheasant crow, crows, partridge, mina, warblers, wagtile, redwattled lapwing, pea fowl, black ibis, adjutant crane, egrets, duck, heron, cormorant, coot, baya, house sparrow etc.  Religious and cultural activities  Chennakeshava temple Hinduism is the predominant religion in Benavara with three main castes, namely Dalits, Akkasaliga and Vakkaliga. Dalits are the majority caste and the village is mostly represented by Dalits in all walks of life. The resident Dalits faced a lot of persecution and discrimination from the neighboring villages till recently. Now discrimination on the basis of caste and creed is almost non existent. Since the turn of this century, there have been many graduates, engineers and doctors from this village. Religious activities in this village are in accordance to Hindu customs and traditions. The village is home for two famous temples in the locality, one dedicated to Goddess Pattaladamma, popularly called Benavaradamma and the other to Goddess Arivinamaramma. These goddesses are believed to be sisters. Pattaladamma is the incarnation of Goddess Parvathi and has devotees from 7 villages including Benavara, who are said to be from this village and migrated to other villages in the centuries ago. Such neighboring villages are Valagaerepura, Keelara, Hanchipura, Chendanahalli, Kuppe and Shettipura. All these villages have allegiance to these Goddesses and they perform all religious ceremonies. Marigudi The devotees from these villages perform the annual festival that falls in the middle of Chaitra masa. The festival is celebrated for 3 days starting on a Friday and ending on a Sunday. Two days are meant for Pattaladamma and one day for Arivinamaramma. People for all neighbouring villages except Kuppe and Settipura attend the festival. Ceremonies are performed with a Kurju, a Chariot; Pooje- a rectangular frame made of bamboo, decorated with 7 Kalasas on top and a mask of the Goddess in the center assembled on a stand, Gindi- a bronze pot placed decorated with colourful jewels, clothes and flowers, usually placed on the head of a devotee; and Patas, bamboo poles wrapped with colourful bands of cloth. The procession passes through the village thoroughfare, accompanied by a band of drummers and pipers with devotees dancing to the tune of the drums. On the first day, which is a Friday, one cart load of firewood from each of the 5 villages arrives at the temple premises at noon along with a procession of dancing devotees. The firewood is stacked in an elongated fire pit called Konda in front of the temple. Firewood is then lit in the evening and by morning, the pit is ready for fire walkers. The head priest and one Gudda, devotees who carry the Pooje, from each of the participating villages walk on the fire with Pooje on their head. Prayers are offered to the Goddess throughout the day followed by a night of revelry with devotees singing folk songs and dancing to the beats of drums. The festivities culminate in a spectacular display of fireworks just before dawn which draws a huge crowd from all neighboring villages. The second day which is a Saturday is called is \\"Jatre\\" (village fair). Processions like the ones described above are carried out in the afternoon and end with the Sun set. Till the 1980s, the day use to end with a ceremony called Doolamari where in the devotees used to sacrifice animals like sheep and goats in the name of the goddess. The sacrifice was performed in such a way that it used to instill fear in the hearts and minds of the devotees who saw the ceremony. The head priest would work himself into a trance and claiming that he had been possessed by the goddess, would kill the sacrificial animals one after the other by biting at gullet and drinking the blood. This practice is now banned. Sri Arivina Maramma temple The third day which is a Sunday is again a day of Jatre, dedicated to Goddess Arivina Maramma, a powerful goddess believed to be younger sister of Goddess Pattaladamma. This day is also marked by animals sacrifices performed by devotees who make the offerings to appease the Goddess. Most of people from the above villages and natives who have settled in other cities visit this temple during the Jatre. All households prepare and serve sumptuous non vegetarian food on this day. The priests of these temples are from the fishermen community and are not Brahmins as one would expect. Temples open weekly on Fridays and attract lot of devotees. These temples are managed by a committee of \\"Dharmadharshees\\" represented from all the seven villages. Untouchability was practiced against Dalits in these temples too till the 1970s. With rise in literacy levels among the youth of the village, untouchability is on the decline and is almost nonexistent now. Stone pillar Bettada Timmappa Temple The village has another temple of religious and historical importance, located on a hill top. It is known as Bettada Thimmappa temple. It is a Hosyala style temple built in the 16th century A.D. Restoration work was carried out in the early 2000s with donations collected from devotees organized by person from a nearby village, Hanchipura. The temple attracts devotees from nearby villages like Valagerepura, Hancipura, Chanadanahalli and M A Colony. The village has many small temples dedicated to various gods like Channigaraya, Maramma- the village goddess, Varadaraya swamy, Anjaneya, Ishwara, Doddamma, Chikkamma which enjoy good patronage. There is a tomb like structure with a statue of Basavanna, small bull which the locals call Basavana Gudi. It is said to be a tomb of 2 maids of a Brahmin priest who lived in the village long time ago. The Brahmin daughters as said to have lost their chastity to some village youths. Unable to marry his daughters off, the angry priest condemned his daughters to tombs and cursed that the perpetrators and their future generations be ruined. This was said to be the root cause for the mass migration of villagers that have obedience to the local Goddesses to other places. Most of the lands are owned by residents of neighboring villages rather than the people of this village. Most of the residents of this village, barring three families, are said to have migrated from Mandya district as far back as 6-7 generation. Benavara has two old stone shelters called \\"Mantaps\\"- built for the travelers and devotees. There is a stone pillar, about 25 feet in height, 5 to 6 feet in girth in the outskirts of the village towards north. It is said to be a pillar that was used to tie the elephant in ancient times. But recent studies carried out by Mysore University in Nov, 2011 have shown that this pillar was planted on the tomb of a village head man or a person of high social standing around 800 BC. This pillar indicates that Benavara village may have been an important place with a history of nearly 3000 years. Villagers celebrate all major Hindiu festivals in accordance to customs and traditions. Sankranti, Shivaratri, Ugadi, Mari habba, Muni, other family deities festivals, Mudipu of Lord Thirupathi Thimmappa, Ekadashi, Shravana, Gowri, Ganesha, Dasara, Pitrupaksha, Karthika are some festivals observed worth mentioning.

The Tarnowski family sold the products of the bloomeries in Sandomierz and Baran√≥w Sandomierski, deciding that the best solution for the family business would be to establish its own independent urban center. On May 28, 1593 King Zygmunt III Waza granted Magdeburg rights to the family village, with permission to stock wine, to make two fairs a year, as well as two markets a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. Tarnodwor, as the town was called, was located on a plain near the Vistula river, in the middle of the large family estate, near the Dzikow Castle. The center of the town was marked by a market square, which now is called Bartosz Glowacki Square. No plans were made for a defensive wall or any kind of fortifications, as Tarnodwor was designed to be a trade and craft center. The creation of the town was accelerated in 1620 ‚Äì 1640, when it belonged to Michal Stanislaw Tarnowski, the Castellan of Wojnicz. A town hall was built, the medieval church at Miechocin was expanded, together with the Dzikow Castle. Jewish settlers came to Tarnodwor, and by the 1650s, the town was a well-established urban center of southeastern corner of Lesser Polands Sandomierz Voivodeship. Swedish invasion of Poland (1655‚Äì1660) brought widespread destruction to the area, as the Swedes destroyed Tarnodwor, together with adjacent villages. Most likely, the Dzikow Castle was saved in unknown circumstances. After the Swedish invasion (1655‚Äì1660), Tarnodwor was so devastated that its residents asked King John III Sobieski to confirm privileges granted to the town by King Zygmunt III Waza. On April 14, 1681, Sobieski agreed, furthermore giving permission for additional fair. Tarnodwor however developed very slowly, due to numerous fires, as well as wars, such as the Great Northern War, when armies of the Russian Empire, Swedish Empire and the Kingdom of Saxony caused destruction comparable to that of the Swedish Deluge. After the death of King Augustus II the Strong, Polish nobility re- elected Stanislaw Leszczynski. Powerful neighbors of the Commonwealth disagreed with this decision, promoting their own candidate, Augustus III of Poland. Representatives of the nobility gathered at the Dzikow Castle in October 1734, to call a confederation in order to defend Leszczynski. The choice of Dzikow was purely random, as its owner, Jozef Mateusz Tarnowski was not engaged in politics. The confederation failed, and in 1772, following first partition of Poland, Tarnodwor was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, where it remained until 1918. From 1772 until 1795, Tarnodwor was located near the Polish ‚Äì Austrian border. Since 1815 (see Congress Poland), the town lay at the Austrian ‚Äì Russian border. In 1809, the Dzikow Castle was destroyed during the Polish‚ÄìAustrian War, and in 1815, the area was flooded by the Vistula. After the November Uprising, Waleria and Jan Feliks Tarnowski decided to leave Russian-occupied Warsaw and moved to Dzikowiec. They initiated restoration of the castle, employing Italian architect Francesco Maria Lanci, who worked on the project in 1834 ‚Äì 1858, turning the complex into a neo-Gothic English style residence. The castle was highly regarded by Polish nobility, who frequently visited it, and since the Tarnowski family was much liked by local peasantry, the Galician slaughter did not take place here. The January Uprising, which began in 1863, was widely supported by local residents as well as the Tarnowskis. Several volunteers crossed the border, weapons, medicines and food were smuggled, and Dominican nuns from Wielowies opened a hospital for the insurgents. After the failed uprising, a public hospital was opened in 1864, with a new building completed by 1884. Tarnobrzeg slowly developed, because in 1887 a rail connection with Dƒôbica and Rozwadow was opened. On September 8, 1904, Bishop of Przemy≈õl Sebastian Pelczar crowned the painting of Our Lady of Dzikow, and on the next day, a monument of Bartosz Glowacki was unveiled, with thousands participating in the event. In 1913, a new rail station was opened, and in August 1914, World War One began. Due to Tarnobrzeg's location near the Austrian-Russian border, the town was the area of heavy fighting, and in the autumn 1915, during the offensive of the Russian Imperial Army, Tarnobrzeg was almost completely destroyed. In October 1918, Polish authorities emerged in the town, but beginnings of the Second Polish Republic were marred by violence, as local revolutionaries created the so- called Republic of Tarnobrzeg. In September 1927, meeting of Conservative Movement took place at the Dzikow Castle, with Walery Slawek as one of the guests. In December of the same year, a dangerous fire took place in the castle, in which 9 people died. In 1929, President Ignacy Moscicki visited Tarnobrzeg. On September 2, 1939, the town was bombed by the Luftwaffe, and on September 13, first Wehrmacht units entered Tarnobrzeg. Soon afterwards, first Polish conspirational organizations emerged, including structures of Union of Armed Struggle, which later turned into the Home Army (AK). The Tarnobrzeg Region of the AK was known by a codename ‚ÄúTwarog‚Äù. Jedrusie, the legendary guerilla force, was created by young residents of Tarnobrzeg. German occupation lasted until August 4, 1944, when the town was captured by the Red Army. Soon afterwards, Tarnobrzeg and its county was the area of a civil war, between Soviets and their Communist allies, and patriotic Polish groups, headed by such people as Hieronim Dekutowski and Kazimierz Bogacz. Fighting continued until the early 1950s. In 1953, rich deposits of sulfur were discovered in the area of Tarnobrzeg by professor Stanislaw Pawlowski. This fact brought far-reaching changes for the town, whose population quickly grew. Newly opened mines at Piaseczno, Machow and Jeziorko gave jobs to thousands of newcomers, for whom new districts were built. In 1975 Tarnobrzeg became the seat of a voivodeship, but it had to share its status with three other towns. Tarnobrzeg was administrative capital of the province, Sandomierz had the status of cultural capital, and Stalowa Wola was the region's industrial capital. The Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship ceased to exist in 1999.

It is about 300 km from the main city Aizawl, located in the Lawngtlai district, towards the southeast of Mizoram and relatively close to Burma. It bears the name of the mountain Phawngpui, often called the Blue Mountain of Mizoram, which is the highest mountain peak in the state, reaching 2,157 m asl. The national park covers the entire mountain along with the surrounding reserve forest. Geography The mountain area of Phawngpui is at most times covered by a thin stretch of clouds, which makes it blue in appearance from a distance, hence the name Blue Mountain. The temperature therefore is mild throughout the year ranging from 11-29¬∞C, with an average rainfall of 3,000 cm. It overlooks the major river Chhimtuipui flowing towards Burma. The edges of the mountains are all very steep and mostly of sharp precipices, and the most spectacular is a semi-circular beautiful cliff on the western side called Thlazuang Kh√¢m, which has a blunt and deep fall. The mountain ridge runs in a north-south direction covering about 10 km. The closest human settlement is Thaltlang village at the base and periphery of the park. Flora and fauna The Phawngpui National Park provides habitat for a range of birds including the rare Blyth's tragopan, falcon, sunbirds, dark- rumped swift, and Mrs. Hume's pheasant, which is the Mizoram state bird, and also rare animals like the mountain goat, slow loris, tiger, leopard, leopard cat, serow, goral, Asiatic black bear, stump-tailed macaque and capped langur. In 2000, rare bird species were recorded such as mountain bamboo partridge, oriental pied hornbill, purple cochoa, striped laughingthrush, grey sibia, black eagle and large-billed crow. The clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) was spotted and documented for the first time in 1997. The landscape is the natural habitat of various grasses (in fact is the origin of the name, phawng in Lai dialect means \\"meadow\\", and -pui is the suffix for \\"great\\"). The steep slopes are covered by orchids and rhododendrons, with areas of bamboos. Tourism The Government of Mizoram allows ecofriendly visit to the national park only during the dry season, i.e. permit is open for 6 months from November to the end of April.

The Federation was founded in 1924 in response to the election of a left-wing government with a secularist policy. After rapidly gaining members and staging large demonstrations, it soon achieved its goal of maintaining the status quo separation between church and state. The movement gradually lost momentum in the years that followed, although it remained in existence during the Vichy regime. Formation The anti-religious Cartel des Gauches (Left-wing coalition) won the 1924 French national elections and formed a government led by √âdouard Herriot. Under pressure to launch an anti-clerical program, Herriot closed the Vatican embassy and passed legislation enforcing secular education in Alsace-Lorraine. In response General No√´l √âdouard, vicomte de Curi√®res de Castelnau organized the F√©d√©ration Nationale Catholique to defend the church against the laicists. The movement had little concern with the form of government, which could be a monarchy or a republic, but considered that all the evils of modern society resulted from the absence of God. Politics were viewed from a Catholic perspective. The Federation was supported by the church hierarchy in France. Jean Guiraud, head of the Associations Catholiques de Chefs de Famille, supported the Federation and advertised its meetings in his columns in La Croix. The right-wing Action Fran√ßaise gave the FNC much support in its defense of religious liberty. Early success General √âdouard de Curi√®res de Castelnau, founder of the Federation In the Federation's official bulletin, le Point de direction, Castelnau hammered home the importance of unity of all Catholics. The first national congress was held in February 1925, by which time there were more than two million members. On 10 March 1925 the cardinals and archbishops of France published a declaration attacking \\"the so- called laws of secularism\\". The church leaders told their congregations to \\"declare war upon laicism and its principles\\" until the anti-Catholic laws were repealed. The Federation held rallies and staged demonstrations, some with up to 100,000 participants. The movement gained its first martyrs on 9 February 1925 in Marseille, when armed gangs attacked a meeting of Federation members and two were killed. The victims were given an impressive funeral, which served to demonstrate the power of the movement and discourage further attempts at intimidation. The Cartel des Gauches was forced to reverse course in 1925, returning to the status quo in which France had an embassy in the Vatican, and Alsace-Lorraine had confessional schools, but where otherwise the church and state were rigidly separated. This compromise held until Marshal Philippe P√©tain took power in 1940. Slow decline By 1926 the Federation had 3 million members. After 1926 the struggle against laicism was replaced by more relaxed negotiations with the authorities. Although theoretically apolitical, the FNC was suspected of being right-wing in its sympathies. The church became concerned about the extremists in the Action Fran√ßaise (AF) movement, and on 8 March 1927 issued a decree excluding habitual readers of the Action Fran√ßaise paper and adherents to the movement from the sacraments and from meetings of Catholic groups such as the FNC, the Catholic Youth and the Catholic Scouts. This was unwelcome to the significant number of supporters of both the FNC and the Action Fran√ßaise. The FNC did not field candidates in the 1928 elections, but advised Catholics to vote only for candidates who supported its published program. The FNC lost authority due to Pope Pius XI's desire to keep Catholic Action completely free from politics and controlled by the church. The FNC was also at odds with the church over foreign policy, in favor of Benito Mussolini in Italy and hostile to Germany, while the Vatican supported the League of Nations. To avoid confusion, the FNC was directed to rename its newspaper from Action Catholique de France to La France Catholique. As the 1930s progressed the church also began to throw its support behind the elected governments of the Third Republic, and advised the FNC to do the same rather than to promote a separate agenda. Writing to his son on 17 June 1940, the day after Marshal P√©tain had taken power, Castelnau said \\"I am devastated. God has given us a harsh punishment for the evils of the French Revolution. France has renounced her past; she did not want to fight.\\" However, the FNC membership generally welcomed the accession of Marshal P√©tain with his pro-Catholic policies. The FNC continued under the Vichy regime, but gradually lost influence. Leaders Xavier Vallat, a right-wing FNC militant later imprisoned for his persecution of Jews under Vichy No√´l-Marie-Joseph-√âdouard de Curi√®res de Castelnau was born in Languedoc in 1851, joined the army and fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. At the outbreak of World War I he was deputy chief of staff to the commander of the army. He held various senior commands. After the war he resigned from the army and in 1919 was elected as a Deputy representing the Catholic right. He lost his seat in 1924 and soon after founded the FNC. Castelnau was a royalist who combined extreme patriotism with extreme Catholicism. General Castelnau provided funding to other right-wing groups including Antoine R√©dier's fascist L√©gion and Pierre Taittinger's Jeunesses Patriotes. He died on 19 March 1944. Other leaders included Abb√© Bergey, a deputy for Bordeaux and a compelling orator, and Philippe Henriot, a right-wing ant-communist and anti-republican. Henriot supported Franco in the Spanish Civil War and supported the 1940 armistice with Germany during World War II. He believed that France and Germany should unite in fighting Communism, the enemy of Christianity. Henriot became the Vichy minister of information and propaganda. He was assassinated by Resistance fighters in Paris on 28 June 1944, and was given a state funeral led by the archbishop of Paris. The FNC militant Xavier Vallat was compelled to accept the papal ban on Action Fran√ßaise membership, but only reluctantly, since he thought that the Action Fran√ßaise and FNC were fighting the same enemy, and had many friends in the Action Fran√ßaise. Vallat preserved his personal contacts in the AF and remained a supporter of Charles Maurras. After World War II, both men served prison sentences for collaboration with the Germans. The leaders of the movement were not all right wing in their views. The abb√© Desgranges, an FNC leader, sympathized with the Christian Democrats. At a meeting he responded to a communist heckler by saying that the Catholic church did not support any political party, but that he was personally opposed to Fascism.

The work was pioneered by Justinus Kerner, who included klecksographs in his books of poetry. Since the 1890s, psychologists have used it as a tool for studying the subconscious, most famously Hermann Rorschach in his Rorschach inkblot test. Method Spots of ink are dropped onto a piece of paper and the paper is folded in half, so that the ink will smudge and form a mirror reflection in the two halves. The piece of paper is then unfolded so that the ink can dry, after which someone can guess the resemblance of the print to other objects. The inkblots tend to resemble images because of apophenia, the human tendency to see patterns in nature. History A page of poetry and art from Justinus Kerner's Klecksographien (1890) Justinus Kerner invented this technique when he started accidentally dropping blots of ink onto paper due to failing eyesight. Instead of throwing them away, he found that intriguing shapes appeared if he unfolded the papers. He elaborated these shapes into intricate cartoons and used them to illustrate his poems. Kerner began a collection of klecksographs and poetry in 1857 titled Klecksographien. His collection was not published until 1890 because of his death in 1862. In 1896, a similar game was described in the United States by Ruth McEnery Stuart and Albert Bigelow Paine in a book titled Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures for Young and Old. The book explained how to make inkblot monsters (\\"gobolinks\\") and use them as prompts for writing imaginative verse. Use in psychology =Binet and Henri= As early as 1895, Alfred Binet and his associate Victor Henri first suggested that inkblots might be used in psychological research, arguing that the interpretation of inkblots could be used to study variations in ‚Äòinvoluntary imagination‚Äô. =Rorschach= As a child in Switzerland, Hermann Rorschach enjoyed klecksography so much that his friends nicknamed him \\"Klecks\\", meaning \\"inkblot\\". As a medical student, Rorschach studied under psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had taught Carl Jung. In studying Freud's work on dream symbolism, Rorschach was reminded of his youthful inkblot hobby. He then created his Rorschach test to see if people's reactions to inkblots could be used as a tool to uncover unconscious desires. The test is essentially a visual variation on Freud's verbal technique.

However, at the same time that their popularity grew, a civil war broke out in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some band members fled to Europe to escape violence, but Bokondji stayed in Kinshasa. As the war died down, his popularity grew again, and in 2006 he was featured in the documentary Jupiter's Dance.

History Bokondji was born in Kinshasa. His father was a Congolese diplomat, and his grandmother was a traditional healer. His grandmother got him started in music as he attended ceremonies and funerals with her to play percussion instruments like drums. Later, his father was posted to the embassy in East Berlin, and the family moved to Germany. It was in Germany that Bokondji started his band, Der Neger, which combined his native Mongo music style with the European rock style of his German bandmates. His father's posting eventually ended, and the family moved back to Kinshasa in the 1980s. Bokondji traveled around the country listening to music from different tribes and solidifying his own style. He formed an orchestra called Bongofolk in 1984 and Okwess International in 1990.Okwess Band Biography International Breakthrough French filmmakers Renaud Barret and Florent de la Tullaye met Bokondji in 2004, and he inspired them to create the documentary Jupiter's Dance, which was released in 2006. The film featured music from Okwess as well as Staff Benda Bilili, another band in which Bokondji is involved. This led to more connections in the international music industry, and Bokondji was invited to join the African Express tour in 2012. The tour puts African and U.K. artists together on a train that tours around Britain, giving performances and promoting cultural exchange. Also in 2012, Bokondji was involved with the DRC Music Project with Oxfam.

They were first drafted in July 2009 at the Panton Arms pub in Cambridge. Drafters of the Panton Principles at the Panton Arms pub History The principles were written by Peter Murray-Rust, Cameron Neylon, Rufus Pollock, and John Wilbanks. They were then refined by the Open Knowledge Foundation and officially launched in February 2010. The Principles 1\\\\. Where data or collections of data are published it is critical that they be published with a clear and explicit statement of the wishes and expectations of the publishers with respect to re-use and re-purposing of individual data elements, the whole data collection, and subsets of the collection. This statement should be precise, irrevocable, and based on an appropriate and recognized legal statement in the form of a waiver or license. When publishing data make an explicit and robust statement of your wishes. 2\\\\. Many widely recognized licenses are not intended for, and are not appropriate for, data or collections of data. A variety of waivers and licenses that are designed for and appropriate for the treatment of data are described here. Creative Commons licenses (apart from CCZero), GFDL, GPL, BSD, etc. are NOT appropriate for data and their use is STRONGLY discouraged. Use a recognized waiver or license that is appropriate for data. 3\\\\. The use of licenses which limit commercial re-use or limit the production of derivative works by excluding use for particular purposes or by specific persons or organizations is STRONGLY discouraged. These licenses make it impossible to effectively integrate and re-purpose datasets and prevent commercial activities that could be used to support data preservation. If you want your data to be effectively used and added to by others it should be open as defined by the Open Knowledge/Data Definition ‚Äì in particular non-commercial and other restrictive clauses should not be used. 4\\\\. Furthermore, in science it is STRONGLY recommended that data, especially where publicly funded, be explicitly placed in the public domain via the use of the Public Domain Dedication and Licence or Creative Commons Zero Waiver. This is in keeping with the public funding of much scientific research and the general ethos of sharing and re-use within the scientific community. Explicit dedication of data underlying published science into the public domain via PDDL or CCZero is strongly recommended and ensures compliance with both the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data and the Open Knowledge/Data Definition. Response Between the launch of the project and December 2011 the principles gained 150 endorsements from researchers. One researcher said the principles allow researchers to better claim credit for their work. The project won an innovation prize from the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition.

He previously played for the Boston Red Sox. In 2018, while with the Red Sox, he became the first player in MLB history to win the Most Valuable Player, Silver Slugger, Gold Glove, batting title, and World Series in the same season. Betts was drafted by the Red Sox in 2011, and made his MLB debut in the 2014 season, splitting time between second base and the outfield. He became the Red Sox center fielder in 2014, before moving to right field in 2016. As a relatively short natural second baseman with a high contact rate and a high level of production when pulling the ball, Betts has been compared to former Red Sox teammate Dustin Pedroia. Betts is also a professional tenpin bowler for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). He bowled a perfect game in the World Series of Bowling. High school career In 2010, Betts's junior year at John Overton High School in Nashville, Betts batted .548 with 24 steals. In November that year, Betts signed a letter of commitment to attend the University of Tennessee on a baseball scholarship, also getting recruited by Vanderbilt University, Mississippi State University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. At Overton, Betts was also a standout basketball player, named MVP of the District 12-AAA league his senior season while averaging 14.1 points, 9 assists, 4 rebounds, and 3 steals per game; and also named Class AAA All-City Player of the Year for the Nashville, Tennessee metropolitan area. His junior year, Betts was named MVP of the District 12-AAA tournament. Betts also excelled in bowling, named the Tennessee boys Bowler of the Year in 2010 with a high score of 290. He grew up bowling at the Donelson Strike and Spare in Donelson, Tennessee. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= The Boston Red Sox selected Betts in the 5th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft with the 172nd overall pick as a 2nd baseman. After protracted negotiations, Betts subsequently rescinded his commitment to the University of Tennessee, signing a $750,000 contract with the Red Sox organization. Betts played two games in 2011 for the GCL Red Sox of the rookie Gulf Coast League, getting two hits in four at bats. In 2012, he batted .267 and stole 20 bases in 71 games for the short season Lowell Spinners of the New York‚ÄìPenn League. He played shortstop regularly, but looked more comfortable at second base. Betts started the 2013 season with the Greenville Drive of the Low A South Atlantic League. In 76 games, Betts batted .296 with a 19-game hitting streak and was selected to the South Atlantic League All-Star Game. On July 9, Betts was promoted to the Salem Red Sox of the High A Carolina League, batting .341 in 51 games to complete the 2013 season with a combined .314 average in 127 games between Greenville and Salem with 15 home runs and 38 steals. Betts was named Offensive Player of the Year and Breakout Player of the Year in the Boston minor league system, leading all Sox minors players with a .506 slugging percentage, while his .314 batting average ranked him third behind Alex Hassan (.338) and Garin Cecchini (.322).

In 2013 and 2014, Betts reached base in 66 straight regular-season games plus five playoff games for a combined streak of 71 games. Because official baseball streak records do not include playoff games, Betts's streak has been listed at 66 games; Kevin Millar and Kevin Youkilis hold the official minor league record for consecutive games reaching base, at 71 games, with Minor League Baseball lacking data on the statistic prior to 1997. Since mid-May 2014, Betts has played outfield in addition to second base. In 2013, four-time All-Star second baseman Dustin Pedroia signed an eight-year, $110 million contract extension with the Red Sox, leading to speculation that the Red Sox would groom Betts for a new position. =Boston Red Sox= 2014 Betts was promoted to the Red Sox on June 28, 2014.

Betts spent most of the 2014 season playing in the outfield, but on September 11, manager John Farrell announced that Betts would play second base \\"fairly regularly\\" following injuries to regular second basemen Dustin Pedroia and Brock Holt. Betts split the 2014 season fairly evenly between AA, AAA and MLB, playing 52 major league games. He performed well for the Red Sox, hitting .291 with five home runs; and played over half his innings in center field. 2015 On April 6, 2015, Opening Day for the Boston Red Sox against the Philadelphia Phillies, he hit a home run in his second at bat, becoming the third youngest player to hit a home run on Opening Day for the Red Sox. On April 13, 2015, in the home opener at Fenway Park against the Washington Nationals, Betts arguably had the most exciting performance of his career. He robbed Bryce Harper of a home run, stole two bases on one play and hit a home run into the Monster seats, all in the first three innings. Betts was named the AL Player of the Week for the week ending on June 21, 2015. Within that week, Betts batted .581 (18 for 31) with two home runs, two triples, three doubles, seven RBI and eight runs. He led the AL in batting average, hits, on-base percentage (.594), total bases (31), and slugging percentage (1.000) that week. In the latter part of the season, he spent some time in right field, leading to speculation that he would move there permanently to allow teammate Jackie Bradley, Jr., to take over in center field. Betts ended the 2015 season with a .291 batting average, with 92 runs scored, 77 RBIs, 18 home runs, and 21 stolen bases. 2016 Betts prior to a game at Camden Yards in May 2016 Betts was selected to the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, the first of his career. He started in right field and was 1-for-2 with a single, and a RBI. Betts was named the AL Player of the Month for July, when he batted .368 (35-for-95) with five home runs, 15 RBIs, five stolen bases and a 1.068 OPS in 23 games. On September 20, Betts became the first player to reach 200 hits during the 2016 MLB season. In 158 games played, Betts finished the season with a .318 batting average, 214 hits, 122 runs scored, 42 doubles, 31 home runs, 113 RBI, and an MLB-leading 359 total bases. His 67 multi-hit games also led MLB. He also was 2nd in the league in power-speed number (28.3). With the Red Sox finishing the season 93‚Äì69, the team clinched the AL East Division, but succumbed to a 3-game sweep by the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 ALDS. Wilson Sporting Goods named Betts its Defensive Player of the Year at right field and overall among all major league fielders. After the season, Betts was named a finalist for the American League MVP Award, alongside Mike Trout and Jos√© Altuve. He finished as the runner-up to Trout. In November, Betts underwent right knee surgery. 2017 Betts batting in September 2017 From September 12, 2016 through to April 19, 2017, Betts maintained a streak of 129 consecutive plate appearances without a strikeout. The streak ended when Francisco Liriano of the Toronto Blue Jays struck him out. In a regular season game at Toronto, he tied an MLB record when he recorded 8 RBIs from the leadoff slot in a 15‚Äì1 rout of the Blue Jays on July 2, 2017. He was granted his second American League All-Star Game selection on the same day. Originally chosen as a reserve, on July 3 Betts was announced as the starter in place of Mike Trout who was out due to surgery on his thumb. Betts ended the season with a .264 batting average, 101 runs scored, 26 stolen bases, 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Betts led the Red Sox in each of those categories except batting average, as he batted just .236 from the All-Star break through September 4. Despite his solid stats on the season, Betts was criticized for his inability to turn balls in play into hits. His batting average on balls in play fell 54 points from its 2016 level, to .268. He also was 3rd in the league in power- speed number (25.0). He won his second consecutive Golden Glove Award this season.  2018: AL MVP  On April 17, 2018, Nick Cafardo of The Boston Globe published a column titled, \\"Mookie Betts or Mike Trout: Who gets the nod?\\" in which he compared Betts to Mike Trout, a then-two-time MVP widely considered the best player in baseball. Of the 10 professional evaluators Cafardo asked, seven chose Trout and three chose Betts. \\"To be in the same conversation as a great player like that is an honor,\\" Betts said. That same night, Betts hit three home runs to lead the Red Sox to a 10‚Äì1 win over Trout's Los Angeles Angels. It was the third three-homer game of his career, tying him with Ted Williams for the most in Red Sox history. Betts broke the tie with Williams and set the franchise record on May 2, hitting three home runs in a 5‚Äì4 win over the Kansas City Royals. He became the first player in MLB history to produce four three-homer games before the age of 26. By May 21, Betts had amassed a major league-leading 15 home runs. He led MLB in batting average, slugging percentage, OPS, total bases, extra-base hits, doubles, runs scored, runs created, and OPS+. He led Boston with 11 stolen bases, good for third in MLB. His 3.8 WAR (as calculated by Baseball-Reference.com) at that point was second only to Trout in the majors. His offensive success was a major factor in the Red Sox‚Äô 32‚Äì15 start. On June 1, Betts was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to May 29, with a left abdominal strain; he returned to the active roster on June 11. On July 6, Betts hit his 22nd home run of the season, the 100th of his MLB career. He became the fourth Red Sox player to hit 100 home runs before turning 26, the others being Tony Conigliaro, Jim Rice, and Ted Williams. On July 8, while batting .343 with 22 home runs and 44 RBIs, Betts was named to the 2018 MLB All-Star Game as an American League starting outfielder. In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 9, he hit for the cycle, becoming the 21st player in Red Sox franchise history to accomplish the feat. On September 26, Betts stole his 30th base of the season, becoming just the second player in Red Sox history to join the 30‚Äì30 club (the first was Jacoby Ellsbury in 2011). Betts finished the 2018 season leading the major leagues with a .346 batting average, a .640 slugging percentage, and 129 runs scored. For the season, he had the highest batting average on balls in play (.373) of all major league players. He also was second in the league in power-speed number (31.0). He had the highest fielding percentage among major league right fielders, at .996. The Red Sox finished the year at 108‚Äì54, and went on to win the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers. During the postseason, Betts hit 13-for-62 (.210) with one home run and four RBIs. After the season, Betts won his third consecutive Gold Glove, the Heart & Hustle Award, and on November 15 was named the American League MVP, receiving 28 of 30 first place votes, making him the only player in American League history to win the World Series, a Gold Glove award, a Silver Slugger award, and the AL MVP in the same season.  2019  Prior to the 2019 season, manager Alex Cora stated he would use Andrew Benintendi as the team's leadoff hitter, with Betts batting second, swapping their positions from the team's usual 2018 batting order. At the beginning of June, Cora announced that Betts would again be the team's leadoff hitter since Benintendi went just 3 for 37 in the leadoff spot. At the end of June, Betts had a .261 average with 13 home runs and 37 RBIs. He was selected as a reserve outfielder to the 2019 All-Star Game. On July 26, Betts had the fifth three-homer game of his career, hitting a home run in each of his first three at bats against James Paxton of the Yankees. For the season, Betts appeared in 150 games while batting .295 with a .915 OPS, 135 runs (leading the major leagues), 29 home runs, 80 RBIs, 40 doubles and 16 stolen bases in 597 at-bats. On defense in 2019, he had a 15 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the best in the American League among right fielders, and had the best fielding percentage of all major right fielders (.997). After the season, Betts was awarded his fourth consecutive Gold Glove and his 3rd Silver Slugger. He finished eighth in 2019 AL MVP voting. =Los Angeles Dodgers=  2020  On February 10, 2020, the Red Sox traded Betts, David Price, and cash considerations to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Alex Verdugo, Connor Wong, and Jeter Downs. On July 22, the Dodgers signed Betts to a 12-year contract extension, through the 2032 season. The deal was worth $365 million and also included a $65 million signing bonus, making it the richest contract in Dodgers history, and the third-richest contract in the history of North American sports. The 2020 season was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 23, Betts was the starting right fielder, making his Dodgers debut on Opening Day against the San Francisco Giants, getting his first hit, a single, as a Dodger against pitcher Tyler Rogers. On July 31, Betts hit his first home run as a Dodger against Arizona Diamondback pitcher Zac Gallen. On August 14, Betts hit three home runs against the San Diego Padres, his sixth three-homer game of his career, tying Sammy Sosa and Johnny Mize as the only players in MLB history to accomplish this feat. Later that month, Betts hit two home runs and stole two bases against the Colorado Rockies, becoming only the 19th player‚Äîand first Dodger‚Äîto have a multi-homer, multi-steal game. On August 27, 2020, he reached 1,000 MLB career hits. Betts finished the 2020 season hitting .292/.366/.562 with 47 runs (4th in the NL), 16 home runs (3rd), 39 RBIs, a .928 OPS, and 10 stolen bases. On defense, he led all NL right fielders in errors, with four. Bowling Betts is an avid bowler; he bowled throughout his youth and competed in the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) World Series of Bowling in Reno, Nevada in 2015 and 2017. He has officially bowled three perfect games, on January 27, 2013; February 2, 2016; and November 12, 2017. His highest game in PBA competition is a 300 game during the World Series of Bowling on November 12, 2017. In February 2019, he won the 2019 CP3 PBA Celebrity Invitational, competing with professional bowler Tommy Jones. Personal life Although it has been reported that Betts is a nephew of Terry Shumpert, who played parts of 14 seasons with several MLB teams, they are actually first cousins once removed, as Shumpert is a first cousin to Betts' mother, Diana. In 2004, Shumpert spent his final season of professional baseball with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds and worked extensively with Betts.\\"Mookie Betts Streaks Through Red Sox System\\", Boston Herald, May 11, 2014. Retrieved May 12, 2014. Betts's first Little League Baseball coach was his mother, Diana, who is also an avid bowler and taught Mookie to bowl at an early age. Betts was named the Tennessee boys Bowler of the Year in 2010, having set Tennessee high school records that season with a 290 game and an 827 three-game series. He has rolled three sanctioned 300 games and has averaged over 200 in league competition. In the 2015 offseason, Betts entered the Professional Bowlers Association's GEICO World Series of Bowling VII, which was held in Reno, Nevada.http://news.pba.com/post/2015/10/6/Boston-Red- Sox-Star-Mookie-Betts-Enter-GEICO-PBA-World-Series-of-Bowling-VII.aspx In 2017 he competed once more in the event. Betts's parents chose his name in part to form the initials MLB, matching those of Major League Baseball. He has attributed his nickname Mookie to his parents watching former NBA guard Mookie Blaylock play basketball shortly after Betts was born. Betts has stated that he has never met Blaylock. His first child, a daughter, was born in November 2018. He is a distant cousin of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

It consists of several sets of hills, separated by valleys; the two main valleys are formed by the Hull and Docker Rivers. There are numerous ravines and gorges all throughout the hills. Bloods Range connects with the Petermann Ranges at its western end. In the centre are Mounts Harris (840 m) and Carruthers (1000 m), which are the highest peaks. Further east, the range splits into several branches, including the Rowley Range, McNichol's Range and the Pinyinna Range. Bloods Range was given its name on 14 March 1874 by the explorer Ernest Giles, when he sighted it from the top of Mount Curdie. He named it for his friend John Henry Smyth-Blood (died 1890) of Beltana, owner of an early pastoral station and pioneer on the OT line. On 12 June 1889, Giles' second-in-command, William Tietkens, returned on his own expedition and surveyed the range. He named the two highest peaks Mount Harris (for surveyor C. H. Harris) and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he recorded that in the distance could be seen Kata Tju·πØa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges.

The 9th Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) led by Colonel Ratko Mladiƒá and the forces of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast (region) of Krajina (SAO Krajina) under Knin police chief Milan Martiƒá besieged the Croat-inhabited village of Kijevo in late April and early May 1991. The initial siege was lifted after negotiations that followed major protests in Split against the JNA. The JNA and the SAO Krajina forces renewed the blockade in mid-August. Kijevo was captured on 26 August, and subsequently looted and burned. The fighting in Kijevo was significant as one of the first instances when the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina against Croatian authorities. The Croatian police fled Kijevo towards the town of Drni≈° and the remaining Croatian population left the village. Martiƒá was tried at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on several different charges of war crimes including, his involvement in the siege of Kijevo. The trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and the findings of the Trial Chamber regarding Kijevo, made in 2007, were confirmed by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege was the first instance of use of the ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatian authorities tried Mladiƒá in absentia and convicted him for war crimes committed in Kijevo. Background In 1990, ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica, HDZ). The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana ‚Äì TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin (approximately north-east of Split), parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991. The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency. Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies, the JNA was denied on 15 March. Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milo≈°eviƒá's control. By the end of March, the conflict had escalated to the first fatalities. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate areas under their control with Serbia. These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions. At the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. To bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve battalions and adopting military organization of the units. There were also 9,000‚Äì10,000 regionally organized reserve police set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies. The reserve force lacked weapons. As a response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde ‚Äì ZNG) in May by merging the special police battalions into four all-professional guards brigades together consisting of approximately 8,000 troops subordinate to the Ministry of Defence headed by retired JNA General Martin ≈†pegelj. The regional police, by then expanded to 40,000, was also attached to the ZNG and reorganized in 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully armed with small arms; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was no command and control structure. The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios. At the time, Croatian stockpile of weapons consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad and 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000-strong special police was established then to replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades. Prelude In 1991, Kijevo was a village of 1,261 people, 99.6% of whom were Croats. It was surrounded by the Serb villages of Polaƒça, Civljane and Cetina. Following the Log revolution, the three Serb villages had become part of the SAO Krajina and road access to Kijevo was restricted as barricades were set up in Polaƒça and Civljane on the roads serving the village. In response, its population set up an ad hoc militia. Following the Plitvice Lakes incident of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drni≈°, with the intention of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications. April‚ÄìMay blockade In the night of 27/28 April, a group of Croatian Ministry of the Interior officers managed to reach Kijevo, and a Croatian police station was formally established in the village on 28 April. The following day, JNA troops, commanded by the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladiƒá, moved in, cutting all access and preventing delivery of supplies to Kijevo. On 2 May, a Croatian police helicopter made an emergency landing in Kijevo after sustaining damage caused by SAO Krajina troops gunfire. The helicopter was carrying then defence minister Luka Bebiƒá and Croatian Parliament deputy speaker Vladimir ≈†eks. The aircraft was able to take off after repairs the same day. Another skirmish took place on 2 May on Mount Kozjak, where a member of the SAO Krajina paramilitary was killed while on guard duty. Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman called on the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea resulted in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of ≈†iroki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegoviƒá, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuƒëman and Cardinal Franjo Kuhariƒá sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegoviƒá. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, two weeks after the blockade had been imposed. August blockade The May arrangement proved short-lived, as the JNA units, again led by Mladiƒá, put up barricades to prevent entry into the village on 17 August 1991. The next day, the Croatian Serb leader Milan Martiƒá laid down an ultimatum to the police and inhabitants of Kijevo, demanding that they leave the village and its vicinity within two days--or face an armed attack. Between 23 and 25 August, Croatian forces evacuated nearly the entire civilian population of the village. On 25 August, Croatian forces launched a failed attack on JNA barracks in Sinj, to the southeast of Kijevo. The objective of the attack was to obtain weapons, needed as Croatian positions near Kijevo deteriorated. On 26 August, the JNA attacked Kijevo, opposed by 58 policemen armed with small arms only and commanded by police station chief Martin ƒåiƒçin ≈†ain. Between 05:18 and 13:00, the JNA fired 1,500 artillery shells against the village, and the Yugoslav Air Force supported the attack with 34 close air support sorties. The same afternoon, the JNA mounted a ground force assault on Kijevo. According to Martiƒá, each house in Kijevo was fired upon. The attacking force consisted of approximately 30 tanks supported by JNA infantry and Croatian Serb militia. The JNA entered the village by 16:30. Lieutenant Colonel Borislav ƒêukiƒá, in command of the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the commanding officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30. The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via Mount Kozjak towards Drni≈°. The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements. The retreating groups were pursued by the Yugoslav Air Force jets as they made their way across the Kozjak. Radio Television Belgrade reporter Vesna Jugoviƒá recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Martiƒá acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area. Aftermath The clash between the Croatian forces and the JNA in Kijevo was one of the first instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating Croatian War of Independence, acting based on Martiƒá's ultimatum. The defending force suffered only two wounded, but one of the retreating groups was captured. The group, consisting of 20 men, were later released in a prisoner of war exchange. The JNA suffered no casualties. After the JNA secured Kijevo, the village was looted and torched. The destruction of Kijevo became one of the most notorious Serb crimes in the early stages of the war. The JNA units which took part in the fighting in and around Kijevo advanced towards Sinj in the following few days, capturing Vrlika before being redeployed to take part in the Battle of ≈†ibenik in mid-September. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the trial of Milan Martiƒá resulted in a guilty verdict with regard to Martiƒá's involvement on Kijevo, and the findings of the Trial Chamber in 2007 regarding Kijevo were confirmed by the Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege of Kijevo was the first instance of application of the strategy of ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. The events at Kijevo were not included in the indictment at the trial of Ratko Mladiƒá, but the Croatian judiciary tried Mladiƒá in absentia for war crimes committed in Kijevo. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Punjabi Ghagra Punjabi Dance 2 The Punjabi ghagra () is a four- piece outfit known as tewar or 'ti-or' which was traditionally worn by Punjabi women throughout the Punjab region with the outfit comprising a head scarf (Phulkari), kurta or kurti, ghagra and either a suthan (baggy trousers with a tight band at the ankles) or the Punjabi salwar. In modern times, the ghagra is worn by women in parts of Haryana, rural parts of south West Punjab, parts of Himachal Pradesh and during performances of Giddha in East Punjab. History The ghagra has its origin in the candataka, which had become a popular garment in the Gupta period. The candataka was a men's half trousers which eventually developed into the ghagra. The intermediate formation has been described as a shirt like dress for men and women from the neck to the thighs. Candataka continued as a popular female dress in the seventh century. Outfit The Punjabi ghagra is part of a four-piece ensemble: Phulkari, kurta/kurti, ghagra and suthan/salwar. The term tewar or ti-or suggests that the outfit was originally a three-piece ensemble which would have comprised the head scarf, kurta/kurti/angi and the ghagra. However, when preparing clothes to give to the bride, the suthan/kurta or salwar kameez outfit is counted as bewar, comprising two articles, with the head scarf not being included. Randhawa (1960) suggests that the only difference between the ghagra ensemble and the Punjabi suit outfit is the addition over the ghagra in the ghagra outfit. Accordingly, even though the Punjabi ghagra is referred to as tewar/ti-or, it is a four-piece outfit and the Punjabi suit, a three-piece ensemble. =Phulkari= The head scarf generally consists of a large Phulkari embroidered using local designs. =Kurta/kurti/angi/choli= ;Kurta/kurti The upper garment is traditionally either a long kurta or a kurti which is a short coat. The kurta is a remnant of the kurtaka which was short and had side slits. It was in use in the 11th century C.E.and provides a link to the kurta of the Punjab region. The kurti is a short cotton coat or a mini anga (dress) without side slits which is believed to have descended from the tunic of the Shunga period (2nd century B.C.). The kurti during the early 1700s buttoned to the right but later versions buttoned down the centre. File:Saraiki children wearing cloths & saraiki Fashion ofr children.JPGSaraiki kurti ;Angi/Choli The angi is the Punjabi name for the bodice which is a short sleeved vest which covers the breast but leaves the chest partly bare and the abdomen wholly exposed. The angi can be worn with the kurti. The angi when worn on its own is called the choli, which covers the chest and has a slip running further down in front. It has short sleeves and is tied behind. The angi differs from the choli only in having no front slip. One design of the choli is made of strips (or patches) of many coloured silk or other material. The arms are generally bare and the stomach is left uncovered. The choli is tied at the back with strings. In the middle of the choli, a kubba is dangled which is a hollow knobby ornament with a pendant fixed onto the centre of the choli. The item used is the tukma which is a silver pendant fixed on to the ends of the choli. The choli was a popular alternative to the kurta in the 20th century, and was in use in the Punjab region since at least the 16th century. It is still popular in Multan where the Multani choli is embroidered in different colours or hand printed, tied at the front or the back. Modern versions of the choli are also worn. File:Model in White Lehenga.jpgModel in White Lehenga and choli File:Punjabi Choli with jewellery.jpgPunjabi Choli with jewellery =Ghagra= Saraiki Tradition women wearing ghagra west Punjab The ghagra is a piece of clothing which can vary from 9 to 25 yards The picture on the right shows the styles worn by Saraiki speaking women in west Punjab. The ghagra is traditionally worn by women of all communities.Punjab District Gazetteers Volume VII Part A Multan District 1923-1924 The materials used for making ghagras can either be malmal or muslin. The edge is finished with either a row of pin tucks, embroidery, gota or by putting a border of daryai (stiffened cloth). The malmal ghagra is traditionally starched (maandi) along with mica or vark which shines in the sun. Vark is similar to thin layers of stiff paper which is crushed and added to maandi (starch). Other materials used for ghagras are hari-shael, latha,Punjabi Sabhiachaar barey by Jit Singh Joshi Waris Shah Foundation saatan (satin), embroidered phulkari, parachute cloth etc. Parachute cloth is a silky material and perhaps similar to the textile used to make parachutes. For formal occasions the ghagra is made of expensive material with some embellishments like gota or embroidery. =Suthan/Salwar= It is traditional to wear either a suthan or a salwar under the ghagra. In Lahore and East Punjab, the ghagra however was only worn when going outdoors or in some areas, when going to another village in which case the kurta/kurti would be replaced by a choli. Women were expected to continue to wear the ghagra over the suthan or the salwar until old age or until at least the eldest child got married. It was also customary to wear the ghagra on festive occasions and when attending funerals. It is still used by elderly ladies and is worn on special occasions. Older Punjabi women living in the United Kingdom recall wearing the ghagra over the salwar. Usage The Punjabi ghagra was envogue in West Punjab and East Punjab on a wide scale during the 1960s.Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala. However, during this time, the Punjabi ghagra began to decrease in popularity and the Punjabi Salwar Suit came to be worn on its own, albeit in some villages in East Punjab the Punjabi ghagra is still worn at funerals. Further, the ghagra is still worn in parts of Haryana, parts of Himachal Pradesh and West Punjab. Lehnga A variation of the ghagra is the lehenga which is traditionally made of finer material than the ghagra as noted in 1878. The lehenga was traditionally popular in urban areas and it is still customary for Punjabi brides to wear the lehngha. Ghagri A shorter version of the ghagra is the ghagri which does not drop to the ankles. This version is traditionally worn in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh but began to lose popularity during the 1960s. In the plains of Punjab, the ghagri was an indoor item. Luanchari Luanchari is a full-dress made of two parts stitched together: the upper part is the choli and the lower is the lehanga. It is traditional garment worn by Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh. =Photo gallery= File:Patiala Phulkari.jpgPhulkari from Patiala File:Nihang Singh and Nihang Singhani.jpgSketch of a woman (right) wearing a suthan File:Apr 21 ontario place punjabi virsa miss brampton.JPGPunjabi kurta and lehenga File:Gota Embroidery.jpgBridal lehenga with Gota Embroidery File:Kangra Painting.jpgPahari painting depicting women in Luanchari. ca.1760 File:Gaddi Couple 1940.jpgHimachal woman in Luanchari File:Geeta Basra lehenga.jpgGeeta Basra lehenga choli File:Rani Jindan (1817-1863) seated on a cushion..jpgRani Jindan (1817-1863) in a ghagra and kurta See also * Ghagra References Category:Indian clothing Category:Pakistani clothing Category:Pakistani culture Category:Indian culture Category:Punjabi Dress ","title":"Punjabi ghagra"},{"id":"39783683","text":"Great tower may refer to: *The keep of a mediaeval castle *Great Tower Activity Centre, a scouting activity centre in Windermere, Cumbria, UK *Great Tower Neuwerk, Neuwerk Island, Germany ","title":"Great tower"},{"id":"39783692","title":"James Northcote (actor)"},{"id":"39783699","text":"Smart is a surname.

Description and function Since broilers are not kept in cages, some method is required to catch the chickens. The traditional hand method was to corral the birds, catch them, grab them by the feet, five per hand (typically), and then drop the animals into crates. This is a backbreaking job, said to be \\"the worst in the poultry industry\\". The chicken harvester machines, by contrast, use different systems to collect and deposit the chickens onto a conveyor belt which then moves and cage them into crates or containers, to transfer them to subsequent processing. Chicken harvesters can harvest from 18 up to 26 tons of birds per hour (about 8000 birds per hour ‚Äì average bird weight 2,5 kg). Studies have demonstrated that the use of chicken harvesters may be less stressful to the birds compared to being hand-wrangled by humans. The use of the machines has also been demonstrated to reduce injuries to chickens compared to those that occur from hand-wrangling, especially in wings and legs. In addition, while the machine does not reduce the number of man hours required to process the animals, it is said to be easier on the workers. A British study found that a mechanical catcher reduced some injuries by as much as 50%. Other studies indicated more modest improvements of 9.5% Paul S. Berry of the British Silsoe Research Institute is credited with the development of the machine, starting in the 1980s. The British government provided $200,000 a year to design the machine, with hopes of reducing livestock suffering. Earlier mechanical machines used a vacuum method. Use in the industry In 2003, about 5% of U.S. birds were caught mechanically. The Italian company CMC Industries (former Ciemmecalabria), is maybe the most famous manufacturer of this type of machinery with the Apollo chicken harvester range (few thousand machines sold around the globe since 1972). Its models do not use the rubber fingers to catch the chickens, as other manufactures do, but a system of conveyor belts which results in a gentle and smooth way to collect the birds. In addition, the Apollo harvester are capable of weighting the birds being loaded. The capacity of the machine can be up to 26 tons of birds per hour (10.000 birds per hour ‚Äì average weight 2.6 kg). Anglia Autoflow has developed a chicken harvester named the Easyload Harvester. The company Bright Coop had made for few years the E-Z Catch Chicken Harvester, capable of handling 5000 birds per hour. The Lewis/Mola Company had manufactured for some years the PH2000-model chicken harvester, said to be one of the more popular models in US, and able to clean 24,000 birds in 3 1/2 hours. In 2003, a typical machine might cost around $200,000, and was described as 9 tons and 42 feet long. Tyson Foods began using the PH2000 in 2001, but discontinued their use in 2009 due to high maintenance costs for the machines. In addition, labor costs in the poultry industry went down in the first decade of the 21st century, making manual processing relatively cheaper.

The book was rare among texts teaching mandolin, because it taught his method in three languages at once, English, French and Spanish. In the third edition of his mandolin-banjo method (1921), he stated in the introduction that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times. In writing his book, he noted the instrument was soaring in popularity in the shape of the banjo. He did not just recycle old material for his book, but also included his own compositions, including Souvenir de Malta, Caminando (a tango), Souvenir de Rome, Un Beso Por Tel√©fono, Qui-Pro-Quo, R√™verie, and Capriccio (a polka).Salvator L√©onardi, M√©thode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline- Banjo, Paris, 1921 As a music teacher, L√©onardi was unsure of whether to include jazz in his book, saying he thought it a faddish style of playing that might not be around very long.

He is one of central Australia's most well-known indigenous artists. Early life Tjapaltjarri was born in the late 1950s, near Lake Mackay, east of where Kiwirrkurra is today. His family were Pintupi hunter-gatherers who lived a traditional nomadic way of life on the western side of the lake, and had never come into contact with Euro-Australian society. Tjapaltjarri's father died when he was a young boy, and his mother remarried shortly after. Tjapaltjarri himself married his cousin, Yalti, sometime around 1980. He served the family's main provider of food, hunting with spears, mirru (spear- throwers) and boomerangs. In 1984, when Tjapaltjarri was about 25, he finally came into contact people from outside his family. Upon seeing a white man for the first time, Tjapaltjarri remembers, \\"I couldn't believe it. I thought he was a devil, a bad spirit. He was the colour of clouds at sunrise.\\" A few days later, he and his family were settled at Kiwirrkurra. News of this group living nomadically so far into the modern world made headlines internationally. Painting Tjapaltjarri started painting in 1987, working with Papunya Tula. Initially practising under the tutelage of other artists at the company, he finished his first painting for them in April 1987. His first public exhibition was in Melbourne, the following year. It showed eleven of his paintings, all of which were bought for the National Gallery of Victoria. He has since become one of central Australia's most well-known artists. Tjapaltjarri paints abstract images of sacred stories and songs from his family's Dreaming. The stories focus around the Tingari, the ancestors of the Pintupi, spirit beings who are believed to have created all living things. His stories are about his country and sacred sites such as Marruwa and Kanapilya. His work is held in several major public collections across Australia, such as in the National Gallery in Canberra, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the National Gallery of Victoria. He also has work in galleries overseas, such as the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, and the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection at the University of Virginia. In 2012, his work was shown as part of the documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany. As of 2008, the most one of his paintings has sold for is A$85,000. In September 2016, one of his paintings sold for 167,000 pounds at Sotheby's in London, and in October 2016, he had his first solo exhibition in the United States, at the Salon 94 gallery in New York City.

(sometimes Crack!) is a 1963 pop art lithograph by Roy Lichtenstein in his comic book style of using Ben-Day dots and a text balloon. It was used in marketing materials for one of Lichtenstein's early shows. It is one of several of his works related to military art and monocular vision.  Background  The source of Crak! is a story from Star Spangled War Stories #102. ¬© April‚ÄìMay 1962, National Periodical Publcations (DC). When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City in February 1962, it sold out before opening. The exhibition included Engagement Ring, Blam and The Refrigerator. The show ran from February 10 through March 3, 1962. After a west coast exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1‚Äì27, 1963, Lichtenstein had his second solo exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery from September 28 ‚Äì October 24, 1963 that included Whaam!, Drowning Girl, Torpedo...Los!, Baseball Manager, In the Car, and Conversation. Named for its onomatopoeic graphic text, Crak! is an offset lithograph on lightweight, white wove paper. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, it was a marketing poster that \\"was published to announce Lichtenstein's exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery, September 28 [-] October 24, 1963.\\" The foundation notes that the work is sometimes dated 1964 with numbered impressions that are inscribed reflecting that date. The screen- printed poster image presents a beret-clad woman shooting a rifle. Lichtenstein recomposed the comic book source ‚Äî from a story written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Jack Abel\\"The Town That Wouldn't Die!\\", Star Spangled War Stories #102 credits, Grand Comics Database.

He also isolated the figure by cropping the foreground and background elements. According to art historian Michael Lobel, monocular vision is the motif in which the subject is \\"depicted frontally in such a way as to expose both eyes to the viewer, yet which has one eye closed or otherwise obscured\\" and not those in which the subject is depicted in profile. The main subject has one eye opened and one eye closed, which relates to a pervasive theme of monocularity in Lichtenstein's art that Lobel was the first to analyze, which also includes works such as Torpedo...Los! and I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of \\"machine and embodied vision\\" as exhibited in works such as Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Bratatat!, and Jet Pilot.

The bill also establishes some of the rules and procedures for enacting this treaty. It was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Outer Continental Shelf Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreements Authorization Act would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to authorize the United States Secretary of the Interior to implement any agreement for the management of transboundary hydrocarbon reservoirs entered into by the President and approved by the United States Congress. The Act then prescribes procedures for submission of such agreements to Congress. H.R. 1613 would also authorize the Secretary of the Interior to implement the terms of the Agreement between the United States of America and Mexico Concerning Transboundary Hydrocarbon Reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico, signed at Los Cabos, February 20, 2012 (the Agreement), including: (1) approving unitization agreements and related arrangements for the exploration, development, or production of oil and natural gas from transboundary reservoirs or geological structures; (2) making available, subject to the agreement's confidentiality protections, information pertaining to such activities that may be considered confidential, privileged, or proprietary; and (3) ensuring that only the operator, lessee, or inspection staff at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement have authority to stop work on such activities on any production site attached to the U.S. seabed. The bill would exempt any actions taken by a public company in accordance with a transboundary hydrocarbon agreement from resources extraction reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Finally, the bill would prohibit the passage and enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreements Authorization Act from being construed as: (1) authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to participate in any negotiations, conferences, or consultations with Cuba regarding exploration, development, or production of hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Mexico along the U.S. maritime border with Cuba (including the area known the \`Eastern Gap'); or (2) affecting U.S. sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf which appertains to it. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office (as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on May 15, 2013), a public domain source. H.R. 1613 would approve a February 20, 2012, agreement between the United States and Mexico regarding the development of oil and gas resources in what is known as the \\"transboundary\\" area in the Gulf of Mexico. It would establish guidelines and procedures for implementing that agreement and for Congressional review of any future agreements governing that area. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this bill because enacting the legislation would affect offsetting receipts, which are recorded as a credit against direct spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enacting H.R. 1613 would increase offsetting receipts from lease sales in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by $25 million over the 2014‚Äì2023 period, thus reducing direct spending by a corresponding amount. Enacting H.R. 1613 would not affect revenues. H.R. 1613 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Outer Continental Shelf Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreements Authorization Act was introduced into the House on April 18, 2013 by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC). It was referred to several committees, including the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, and the United States House Committee on Financial Services for debate, discussion, and amendment. On June 21, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 1864 would be on the floor calendar for the week of June 24. On June 27, 2013, the House voted in Roll Call 293: 256-171 to pass H.R> 1613.

The story is set at the border between two fictional Mediterranean countries, Orsenna and Farghestan, which have been at war for 300 years. It is Gracq's third and most famous novel. It was awarded the Prix Goncourt, but Gracq refused to accept the prize as a protest against commercial compromising in world literature. The novel has been described as a \\"Wagnerian prelude for an unplayed opera\\" as it doesn't focus on telling a story but is first and foremost concerned with creating a mysterious, out-of-time atmosphere. Plot A novel of waiting, it is set in an almost empty old fortress close to a sea which defines the ancestral border between the stagnant principality of Orsenna and the territory of its archenemy, the mysterious and elusive Farghestan. The two countries are officially at war although no fighting has taken place for decades, so that there is an uneasy, de facto peace. The main character, Aldo, is sent as an \\"observer\\" to the isolated fortress. Bored with the immobility and eerie silence, he longs for action and slowly becomes obsessed with the unseen border. Aldo starts entertaining the thought of crossing it, even if that leads to a resuming of hostilities and the possible collapse of his own civilisation, reasoning that destruction may be preferable to slow decadence. The novel ends when the \\"story\\" begins, i.e. when consequences of his actions start manifesting themselves. Themes Like several other works by Julien Gracq, The Opposing Shore expresses its author's fascination with expectation, the foreboding and apocalypse. Orsenna symbolizes history, tradition and order, while Farghestan stands for the irrational and ahistorical. Aldo's attraction to Farghestan and his attempt to escape the reality of history is portrayed as both heroic and self- destructive. The dreamlike qualities of the novel are related to Gracq's previous affinity with the surrealist movement; Gracq described The Opposing Shore as an \\"awakened dream\\". Publication The book was published through Jos√© Corti in 1951. An English translation by Richard Howard was published by Columbia University Press in 1986.

Within the brain, dendrin can be found in neurons and is most notably associated with sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation causes some areas of the brain dendrin levels to increase, but this increase is insignificant and in total sleep deprivation causes a decrease of the mRNA and protein form of dendrin. Along with two other proteins, MAGI/S-SCAM and Œ±-actinin, dendrin is linked to synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the brain. Nicotine levels have also been shown to have an effect on dendrin expression in the brain. Although unlike sleep deprivation, nicotine increases overall dendrin level. Originally thought to be a brain specific protein, there is now evidence to suggest that dendrin is also found in the kidneys. Dendrin is used to detect glomerulopathy or renal disease, based on its location in the kidneys. Within the kidneys it also works to prevent urinary protein loss. Most studies and information on dendrin pertain specifically to rat or mice brains. Structure Dendrin has a similar structure in mice, rats, and humans. The protein is composed of 2,067 nucleotides, is hydrophilic, and is rich in the animo acid proline. Dendrin is a protein kinase substrate that is composed of multiple consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, casein kinase 11, CAMP-dependent and proline-dependent kinases, and tyrosine kinase. Surprisingly, the protein structure does not have any secondary structure patterns, such as lengthy regions of Œ± helices or Œ≤ sheets. Appropriately named, dendrin in its mRNA form is often found in the dendrites of neurons. The unique structure of dendrin allows it to participate in many different processes, such as synaptic plasticity in the brain and disease detection in the kidneys. Discovery Dendrin was originally discovered in rat neurons and encoded by the brain specific transcript 464 by M. Neuner-Jehle. In 1996, 6 rats were tested using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-dendrin antibodies. Using this technique two different proteins were identified one of which was dendrin. Dendrin expression was measured in sleep deprived rats and in control rats. Neuner-Jehle found that when the rats were sleep deprived, dendrin levels decreased. Neuner-Jehle also studied the location of dendrin expression by staining brain sections and was able to show the areas that were richest with dendrin. Most notably, the greatest protein was found in the forebrain and hippocampus. After this initial study, it was assumed that dendrin was located only in the brain.Neuner-Jehle, M., Denizot, J., Borb√©ly, A., & Mallet, J. (1996). Characterization and sleep deprivation-induced expression modulation of dendrin, a novel dendritic protein in rat brain neurons. Journal of Neuroscience Research, 46(2), 138-151. However, in 2006, Kawata et al. found that the dendrin protein is also located in the kidneys. A yeast two-hybrid screening of kidney cDNA proved to find dendrin in the kidney podocytes, where it connects to cytoskeleton proteins: S-S-SCAM and CIN85. Location Dendrin is expressed in the forebrain (pictured in red above and in the hippocampus of the brain It is now known that dendrin is found in the brain and kidneys, but it is not expressed everywhere in these two organs. Dendrin has only been found in a very specific part of the brain and specific parts of the kidneys. Within the brain, dendrin is normally found in the forebrain and hippocampus and in the kidneys, dendrin is normally found in the slit diaphragm and podocytes. It is believed that the location of this protein may directly affect its function, both in the brain and in the kidneys. =Brain= Dendrin is a postsynaptic proteinKawata, A., Lida, J., Ikeda, M., Sato, Y., Mori, H., Kansaku, A., . . . Hata, Y. (2006). CIN85 is localized at synapses and forms a complex with S-SCAM via Dendrin. Journal of Biochemistry, 139(5), 931-939. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvj105 that is found in the forebrain and hippocampus. Specifically in the forebrain, dendrin is found in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical forebrain plus midbrain areas (SFMA). Dendrin has yet to be found in other parts of the brain, but is very abundant in the parts of the brain where it is known to be expressed. Within these known locations in the brain, dendrin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Dendrin is found in the neuron's cell body and its dendrites.Herb, A., Wisden, W., Catania, M. V., Marechal, D., Dresse, A., & Seeburg, P. H. (1997). Prominent dendritic localization in forebrain neurons of a novel mRNA and its product, dendrin. Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, 8(5), 367-374. doi: 10.1006/mcne.1996.0594 This is the part of the cell that helps it to retain its structure and move other molecules throughout the cell. MAGI/S-SCAM is a component of the cytoskeleton that is used to keep dendrin in the cytoplasm of a neuron, and prevents the protein from diffusing into the nucleus. Because of this location in the neuron, it is thought that dendrin is involved in retrograde signaling from the synapse to the nucleus. This form of signaling is the reverse of normal neural signaling so that instead of the signal passing from the nucleus to the synapse, is passes from the synapse to the nucleus. =Kidneys= Renal corpuscle showing the podocytes, where dendrin is located in the kidneys Dendrin is also expressed during mouse glomerulogenesis. The protein is usually expressed during the early capillary loop stage of glomerulongenesis and creates a linear pattern on the epithelial side of these loops. In normal mature kidneys, dendrin is found only in the podocytes near the slit diaphragm.Duner, F., Patrakka, J., Xiao, Z., Larsson, J., Vlamis-Gardikas, A., Pettersson, E., . . . Wernerson, A. (2008). Dendrin expression in glomerulogenesis and in human minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, 23(8), 2504-2511. doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfn100 Podocytes are epithelia cells in the kidneys that do not readily divide and act as a barrier that prevent urinary protein loss. Dendrin interacts with S-SCAM (used in organization of synapses) and CIN85, two scaffold proteins in the kidneys. Within this organ, dendrin's functions include the prevention of urinary protein loss and the formation of protein-protein interaction webs at dendritic spines. Slit Diaphragm The slit diaphragm is a part of the kidneys that regulates renal ultrafiltration.Yaddanapudi, S., Altintas, M. M., Kistler, A. D., Fernandez, I., Moller, C. C., Wei, C. L., . . . Reiser, J. (2011). CD2AP in mouse and human podocytes controls a proteolytic program that regulates cytoskeletal structure and cellular survival. Journal of Clinical Investigation, 121(10), 3965-3980. doi: 10.1172/jci58552 Specifically, it is a part of the glomerular filter, which separates blood from urine. The slit diaphragm is very thin molecular sheet that mainly filters out plasma proteins and separates the foot processes of glomerular podocytes.Grahammer, F., Schell, C., & Huber, T. B. (2013). Molecular understanding of the slit diaphragm. Pediatric Nephrology, 28(10), 1957-1962. doi: 10.1007/s00467-012-2375-6 The slit diaphragm is attached to the actin cytoskeleton of the cell. Dendrin associates regularly with the slit diaphragm because the dendrin protein is located in these podocytes. Function Although the exact function of dendrin is not known, there is a great deal of data to show what processes it contributes to and potentially regulates. Dendrin is normally affected by different behaviors. Most commonly studied in rats, dendrin is known to decrease with prolonged sleep deprivation and increase with acute nicotine intake. Within the brain, dendrin interacts with Œ±-actinin in postsynaptic dendritic spines. Together MAGI/S-SCAM, Œ±-actinin, and dendrin form a tertiary complex at postsynaptic neural sites. This trio of proteins helps to connect a dense filamentous lattice (postsynaptic density or PSD) to the cytoskeleton of the spine and is also linked to synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Additionally, the protein binds to nephrin and CD2AP within the kidneys, where can help with intracellular signaling pathways. In conjunction with the slit diaphragm, dendrin helps to prevent urinary protein loss.Asanuma, K., Campbell, K. N., Kim, K., Faul, C., & Mundel, P. (2007). Nuclear relocation of the nephrin and CD2AP-binding protein dendrin promotes apoptosis of podocytes. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104(24), 10134-10139. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0700917104 =Sleep Deprivation's Effect on Dendrin= When dendrin was originally discovered, it was associated with sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep causes a decrease in dendrin mRNA concentrations even after only 24 hours of no sleep. There is a slight increase in dendrin mRNA in the hippocampus caused by sleep deprivation although it is very minimal. Within the cerebral cortex, dendrin mRNA concentrations remain unchanged. Even though some dendrin levels in the brain rise or remain unchanged when sleep deprivation occurs, overall the levels of dendrin decrease. Through multiple studies it was found that there is a correlation between the levels of dendrin and sleep deprivation. Since it is still not clear what role dendrin plays in the brain, it is unclear how the processes dendrin is involved in are affected by lack of sleep. =Nicotine's effect on dendrin= Even a small amount of nicotine (pictured above) can have an effect on dendrin levels. Dendrin mRNA levels are increased with nicotine use in adolescent rat brains; however, these same levels of protein do not change in adults rats. It has also been shown that dendrin expression is not altered by cocaine or by placing the subject in a new or different environment. The proteins that dendrin typically associates with tend to be proteins that are linked to synaptic modification and learning. Expression of dendrin with even a small amount of nicotine could alter these processes and functions. Increased expression of dendrin caused by nicotine use is found mostly in the forebrain region of rats. Additional increase in dendrin mRNA is also found in the striatum.Schochet, T. L., Bremer, Q. Z., Brownfield, M. S., Kelley, A. E., & Landry, C. F. (2008). The dendritically targeted protein Dendrin is induced by acute nicotine in cortical regions of adolescent rat brain. European Journal of Neuroscience, 28(10), 1967-1979. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06483.x =Synaptic Plasticity= The protein trio of MAGI/S-SCAM, Œ±-actinin, and dendrin helps to connect postsynaptic density (PSD) to the cytoskeleton of the spine. The spatially restricted synthesis of dendrin contributes to the regulation of the synaptic cytoskeleton. The postsynaptic cytoskeleton, in turn, is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation suggesting that dendrin expression plays a role in these two brain functions.Kremerskothen, J., Kindler, S., Finger, I., & Barnekow, A. (2006). Postsynaptic recruitment of dendrin depends on both dendritic mrna transport and synaptic anchoring. Journal of Neurochemistry, 96, 1659-1666. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03679.x If the synapse is damaged, this protein trio may play a role in its ability to regain function or the synaptic function to be taken over by another part of the brain. The involvement of dendrin in memory formation also suggests that external influences like sleep deprivation or nicotine consumption can alter or affect how memories are formed or stored. Regulation of Dendrin Down- regulation of dendrin is due to sleep deprivation which reduces the numbers of dendrin in the neuron. Sleep deprivation causes the most notable regulation and while it does not cause a decrease in dendrin mRNA and protein everywhere in the brain, the most significant change in dendrin levels is an overall decrease. Dendrin is regulated in the kidneys by CD2AP, which assists in dendrin movement to the nucleus of the podocyte. This movement mainly occurs when an injury, or cell death occurs in the podocyte epithelial cells. Injury in the Kidneys When there is glomerular injury in the kidneys, the dendrin protein relocates to the podocyte nucleus in the slit diaphragm. The movement of this protein to the podocyte is associated with podocyte apoptosis. There is proof that the action of a podocyte cell killing itself causes dendrin to move to the nucleus. Damage to the podocytes causes the silt diaphragm to collapse and tight junctions, or cell to cell connections to be formed. It has been shown that dendrin is involved in promoting apoptosis of the podocytes. Apoptosis leads to a decrease in podocyte epithelial cells which causes proteinuria and could culminate in glomerulosclerosis. This relocation of dendrin can potentially help to diagnose any kidney damage or kidney disease. Dendrin locations in the kidneys can help determine the stage of glomerulosclerosis and how many podocytes have been lost to apoptosis.Asanuma, K., Akiba-Takagi, M., Kodama, F., Asao, R., Nagai, Y., Lydia, A., . . . Tomino, Y. (2011). Dendrin Location in Podocytes Is Associated with Disease Progression in Animal and Human Glomerulopathy.

He captured two medals at the 1999 All-Africa Games, and later represented South Africa at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Folker was schooled in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. His primary years were spent at Cowan House Preparatory School, after which he attended Michaelhouse. In recognition of his achievements and dedication to swimming, Michaelhouse renamed one of its swimming pools the Folker Pool. While moving on to reside in the United States, Folker achieved school records in a sprint freestyle double and also trained for the University of Hawaii's swimming and diving team, also known as the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, under the tutelage of head coach Sam Freas. Folker made his own swimming history at the 1999 Summer Universiade in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, where he earned a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle at 50.77, finishing behind Russia's Denis Pimankov and Italy's Mauro Gallo. When his nation South Africa hosted the All-Africa Games in Johannesburg on that year, Folker added two more medals to his career hardware in front of a massive home crowd: a silver in the 50 m freestyle (22.83) and another bronze in the 100 m freestyle (50.61). At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Folker competed in two swimming events with only six days in between. First, he teamed up with Roland Mark Schoeman, Brendon Dedekind, and deaf-mute Terence Parkin in the 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg in heat two, Folker overhauled a 50-second barrier and recorded a split of 49.57, but the South Africans missed the top 8 final by 1.09 seconds, finishing in fifth place and eleventh overall with an African standard of 3:21.28. Because of his powerful effort in the freestyle relay, Folker was selected to join with Simon Thirsk, Brett Petersen, and Theo Verster in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay six days later. During the prelims race, he swam a freestyle leg in the same heat with a scintillating anchor of 49.53 to deliver a fourth-place finish and thirteenth overall for the South Africans in 3:42.44. The following year, at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane, Australia, Folker, along with his teammate Schoeman and Latin American sprinters Jos√© Meolans (Argentina) and Fernando Scherer (Brazil), captured a silver medal for the all-stars team in the freestyle relay (3:18.78). Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Folker worked as a strength and conditioning coach for the California Golden Bears men's swimming and diving team at the University of California, Berkeley. He was hired to be an assistant coach at his alma mater, the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Rainbow Wahine swimming and diving teams in September 2019.

When exposed to moisture through humidity absorption or direct immersion, most wood species will expand and change shape. When moisture comes into contact with wood, the water molecules penetrate the cell wall and become bound to cell wall components through hydrogen bonding. With addition of water to the cell wall, wood volume increases nearly proportionally to the volume of water added. Swelling increases until the fiber saturation point has been reached . Wood stabilization limits water absorption into the wood structure, thereby limiting the dimensional changes which arise from moisture exposure. Wood stabilization is a subset of wood preservation processes specifically used by woodworking enthusiasts to alter the material properties of specific wood species for applications within their craft or trade. Examples of wood items which are commonly stabilized include knife handles, pistol grips, straight razors, game calls and jewelry. One of the most commonly used stabilizing methods utilizes a heat cured polymer known as methyl methacrylate (MMA).  Material Properties  Material properties of stabilized wood varies by specific species and type of stabilization process used, however in softwoods and soft hardwoods, the improvement in strength, hardness and durability can be dramatic. For example, Poplar treated with MMA increased specimen density by 2.2 to 2.6 times with gains in hardness of approximately twofold (using the Janka Hardness Test).

Career highlights  Jacky June was born in Brussels, and began studying piano at the age of six. In 1943, he joined the Henry Van Bemst (born 1916) Orchestra. After World War II, June founded and directed his own jazz orchestra at the Hotel Cosmopolite Bruxelles. He also played with Hot Club de Belgique and the Kot Jazzmen, the latter from which, in the 1950s, his Jump College Orchestra emerged. In 1951, he performed with Roy Eldridge at Jazzclub La Rose Noire. Jazz critics compared June's style to that of Sidney Bechet and Benny Carter, both with whom June recorded, along with Ren√© Thomas, Jean Blaton, Peanuts Holland, Don Byas and L√©on Demeuldre in 1965, and perhaps in 1967 and 1971. In the 1950s, his Jump College Orchestra fronted Charles Trenet and Marlene Dietrich at the Knokke Casino and Sidney Bechet at the Palais des Beaux-Arts. He died at Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium. The Kot Jazzmen was founded during the Nazi occupation of Belgium. At that time, a number of Brussels musicians went into hiding and got together in a tiny four-story building on the Rue des Moineaux. The house became famous as Le Kot (the Digs).

Early life Clara Jones Crittenden and four of her children, ca. 1855 Laura Crittenden Sanchez, Ramon Sanchez, Ann Churchill Crittenden and Alexander P. Crittenden, ca. 1863 Alexander Parker \\" A.P.\\" Crittenden was born in 1816 to Thomas Turpin Crittenden (1788-1832) and Mary Wilson Parker (1792-1869) in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the nephew of John Jordan Crittenden and grandson of John Crittenden, Sr.. He graduated from West Point in 1836 at age 20. He had once been expelled for a prank but was reinstated by appealing directly to President Andrew Jackson. He joined the army as a Lieutenant of Artillery, but quickly resigned his commission. He gained employment as an engineer for railroad companies. In 1838 he married Clara Churchill Jones Crittenden (1820-1881), and they had fourteen children altogether, but only eight lived to adulthood. In 1839, the family moved to Brazoria County, Texas where Crittenden read law, was admitted to the bar, and started practicing law. In 1849, seeking wealth, he trekked on horseback by way of Mexico and Arizona to Los Angeles, California. His traveling companions included James Audubon and Parker's brother-in-law, Dr. Alexander Jones, who suffered a knife wound in a fight in Tucson, Arizona. In Los Angeles, nearly bereft of funds, Parker was elected to the first California legislature and was provided the means for the trip to San Jose. He chaired the judiciary committee in the 1st and 2nd state assemblies.Alexander P.

He established law practice in San Francisco, Crittenden and Randolph, and served as counsel in 26 Supreme Court of California cases. He helped administer the William Walker (filibuster) conquest of Nicaragua in 1855. He spoke against the vigilantes, and kept his uncle in the U.S. Senate, John Jordan Crittenden appraised of that activity. Civil War In 1861, he became the leader of the southern wing of the California Democratic Party and was elected chairman of the state Southern Democratic Central Committee, of Confederate sympathies. In 1863, with his brother-in-law attorney/politician Tod Robinson, he relocated to Virginia City, Nevada Territory after refusing to take the wartime oath of allegiance to the federal government. In Nevada Territory, Crittenden handled mining claims cases, and speculated in mining stocks. He lived in Virginia City and Aurora. He was defeated as the Esmeralda County, Nevada representative to the Nevada state constitutional convention in 1863.Alexander, Russell J. The Crittenden Correspondence, The Chronicle, Vol 33, No. 1. The 1851 - 1861 period. Archived Clara remained in San Francisco and assisted the wife of Confederate Gen. Albert Sydney Johnston who had gone east for the war; falling in 1862 at Shiloh.

Two of Parker's sons, Churchill and James Love, joined the Confederate States Army without their father's permission. After he sent them to Europe, they jumped the ship in Havana and made their ways to the Confederacy.

Cousin George Bibb Crittenden served the CSA as a general while other cousins, Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden and Lt. Col. Thomas Theodore Crittenden remained loyal to the Union. His brother Thomas Turpin Crittenden, a veteran of the Mexican War, fought and won the first land battle of the Civil War for the Union at Philippi in western Virginia. Later he was captured by Gen. Nathan B. Forrest in the Battle of Stones River. The Laura Fair affair In Virginia City he met and started a relationship with Laura Fair, the owner of the Tahoe House Hotel. Initially Fair believed him to be single, and when she discovered he was married, he allegedly promised to divorce his wife. In November 1870, as he sat next to Clara aboard the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco, Fair shot him in the heart; he died the next day, November 5, 1870. Fair's subsequent sensationalized trials, revealing the tawdry details of the prolonged affair, exposed the family to great embarrassment.Haber, Carole.

Background Bankston is the son of the late long- term Louisiana Democratic Party chairman Jesse Bankston and the former Ruth Paine (1918‚Äì1997). Ruth Bankston was a member of the East Baton Rouge Parish Democratic Executive Committee and was a delegate to two national party conventions. Larry Bankston has a sister, Shirley B. Newsham, and two brothers, Dale Leon Bankston and Jesse Bankston, Jr., an assistant district attorney in East Baton Rouge Parish. Bankston graduated from Broadmoor Senior High School and Louisiana State University, both in Baton Rouge, and Loyola University Law School in New Orleans. He is a member of the legal honor society Phi Delta Phi and contributed to the Loyola Law Review. Bankston was admitted to the bar in 1976. From his first marriage to Jane Vance (now Mrs. Jane Smith), Bankston has four children: Dr. Larry \\"Chip\\" Bankston, Jr., Laura Bankston Petty, Benjamin V. Bankston, and Hunter W. Bankston. From his second marriage to the former Lynn Naebers Krielow, Bankston has two stepchildren, Kendall J. Krielow and Ashlyn C. Krielow. On December 19, 2007, Larry \\"Chip\\" Bankston, an orthopaedic physician then in residency in Birmingham, Alabama, lost both his wife, the former Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" Gibbs, and six-week-old son, Graham Gibbs Bankston, who are interred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The deaths in Birmingham were attributed to the mother's postpartum depression. Political career From 1978-88, Bankston was a staff attorney for the office of the state attorney general in Baton Rouge. From 1979 to 1982, he was assistant parish attorney for East Baton Rouge Parish. From 1982 to 1988, Bankston was a member of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council, an elected governing body. Bankston was first elected to the Senate in the 1987 general election in a narrow outcome with the Republican businessman Jay Dardenne, since Louisiana's Commissioner of Administration under Governor John Bel Edwards. Bankston prevailed by 287 votes, 12,619 (50.6 percent) to 12,332 (49.4 percent). The seat was vacated by Democrat Thomas H. Hudson, a Baton Rouge lawyer who was President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the second-ranking leadership position, during his third term (1984‚Äì88). Bankston was reelected in 1991 under revised district boundaries in the nonpartisan blanket primary with 51.2 percent of the vote over four fellow Democratic candidates. Bankston compiled a largely progressive voting record in the Senate, siding almost always with the positions of Edwin Washington Edwards, Victor Bussie, and Planned Parenthood, amongst other individuals and organizations. He was a supporter of casino gambling, abortion rights, and the repeal of right-to-work laws. Prior to 1992, he was a floor leader for Governor Buddy Roemer.Minden Press-Herald, October 13, 1995, p. 9A. Bankston did not seek a third term in the 1995 primary, and the seat was won by Democrat Wilson Fields, brother of then-U.S. Representative Cleo Fields, an African American who ran for governor in 1995 but was defeated by Mike Foster. Federal racketeering conviction In 1994, Bankston, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, met in his law office with Fred Goodson, the owner of a video poker truck stop in Slidell in St. Tammany Parish. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bankston and Goodson, a close friend of Bankston's colleague, Gerry Hinton, discussed a plan to manipulate the legislative process so as to protect the interests of the video poker companies. In return, the key lawmakers would net clandestine financial interests in the video poker truck stops. The late C. B. Forgotston, an attorney, government watchdog, and an opponent of gambling, then from New Orleans who relocated to Hammond, referred to the Bankston case, accordingly: \\"It's one of the things we were worried about in the beginning: that it [gambling] would totally corrupt our political system. ... People would just laugh and say our system is already corrupt. But you've never seen anything like this.\\" On October 4, 1996, Bankston was indicted on five counts of racketeering. In 1997, Bankston was found guilty on two of the counts. One count was the acceptance of a bribe from Fred Goodson. The bribe was phantom \\"rent\\" of $1,555 monthly paid to Bankston for \\"non-use\\" of the lawmaker's beachfront condominium in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Prosecutors determined the arrangement a \\"bribe\\" and a \\"sham\\". He was given a 41-month sentence and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine. Bankston served most of his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Beaumont, Texas. While in prison, Bankston appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, but the judges upheld his conviction on July 27, 1999. Bankston was released from the Bureau of Prisons on November 6, 2000, and he then served a remaining portion of the sentence in a half-way house in Baton Rouge. On March 9, 2002, Bankston was disbarred by the Louisiana Supreme Court, retroactive to November 19, 1997. On February 5, 2004, with only one dissenting vote, the disciplinary committee recommended that the high court re-admit Bankston to the practice of law. There had been concern by the committee that Bankston had not been sufficiently remorseful over the commission of his crimes. He practices law at Bankston and Associates at 8708 Jefferson Highway in Baton Rouge.

His developments include Adriatica, in which he intends to reproduce the look and feel of an old-world southern European village (most notably, an Adriatic coast Croatian village) in Texas.  Early life  Jeff Blackard was born in Peoria, Illinois to Richard and Janice Blackard. Blackard was the state decathlon champion for 3 years running while in High School at Argenta-Oreana High School. Blackard was also the all-time leading scorer for his high school team and was recognized as a notable alumnus and in the school's hall of fame.:File:Article_about_the_early_career_of_Jeffory_Blackard.pdf He went to Northwestern University on a track and field scholarship which turned into a basketball scholarship during his sophomore year. Blackard was later recognized as one of Northwestern's 100 most notable graduates for his work in philanthropy and his theory of village evolution, Neoretroism. Real Estate After graduating from Northwestern University in 1981, Blackard moved south to Texas and worked for Cambridge Companies:File:Jeff_Blackard_Off_and_Winning_in_the_busines_world.jpg before being made partner at age 26 and eventually leaving to develop over 15,000 single homes through the completion of projects including Lakes on Legacy, Griffin Parc and Pirates Beach and Cove in Galveston, Texas. In addition to an early focus on master-planned communities, Blackard also developed projects including multi-family complexes, office parks, retail, restaurants and resorts totaling over $2 billion in asset creation. After buying an interest in properties on the coast of Croatia, Blackard has focused much of his work on the evolution process of a village. Adriatica, a $350 million vertically integrated, mixed-use development, is located in McKinney, Texas. Adriatica takes its inspiration from the Croatian fishing village of Supetar on the island of Braƒç. In the time since the Great Recession, in addition to advising other real estate developers on the creation of villages, Blackard has undertaken new villages like Entrada in Westlake, Texas, Barisi and the revitalization of North Beach in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Wolf Lakes in Georgetown, Texas.  Environmentalism  Blackard received an environmental commendation from the United States Department of the Interior in association with the Delhide Cove Protection and Restoration Project that he undertook in the early 2000s. Blackard also donated an island North of Lafitte's Cove in Galveston, renamed The Robert M. ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Moore Wildlife Sanctuary, to the Galveston Bay Foundation in 2007 for the conservation, protection, and enhancing of the South Texas Wetlands. Political Activism Blackard is also an independent political activist, who supported 2012 United States Presidential candidate Rick Santorum in response to his stalwartly Christian policy positions. Blackard worked to bring Santorum to his village in McKinney, Adriatica, shortly after a successful Super Tuesday in 2012 with Santorum leading in the polls. The Dallas Morning News quoted Bud Kennedy, longtime reporter for the Star Telegram and Dallas Morning News, saying of Blackard, \\"He helped plan Santorum‚Äôs euphoric visit to staunchly evangelical Collin County.\\" In 2017 Blackard was awarded the Friend of Croatia Award from the Association of Croatian American Professionals. He is a notable influencer in the politics of Croatia, having arranged meetings with high-level officials in American Politics and the president of Croatia and lobbying for a double taxation avoidance treaty.  Philanthropy  Jeff Blackard (top left) on the riverboat Linda Esperanca in Brazil in 2003.

Synopsis Jos√© Ben Alvar Mozarabic lives in C√≥rdoba, where he excelled in school and planned to one day teach. His particularly strong skill in mathematics earns him much praise, but also much envy from a fellow student named Ali Ben Solomon. Ali was especially jealous due to their religious differences, as Ali was Muslim and Jos√© was Christian. Two years have passed since the Caliph Al-Hakam proposed peace with the Catalan counties, however Ali and his father do whatever they can to keep Jos√© from being awarded a coveted prize for being the best student of the year. They lie and say that Jos√© had blasphemed Muhammad, which prompts Jos√© to flee to the Catalan where he can't receive the prize or do any serious studies. On his way to Catalonia Jos√© makes several friends, one of which is a young nun that can recite mathematical problems. He also meets Emma, the daughter of a man that fled an Arab land. In the end Jos√© marries Emma and they live happily in Navarre. The two also send a letter to Jos√©'s father saying that they would like to go to Toledo and raise a family.

The first fire, the West Fork fire, was started by lightning at about 1 PM on June 5, 2013. All three fires were started by lightning. As the fire moved into heavy dead timber in early June, thousands of firefighters struggled to prevent movement of the fires into populated areas. It was composed of the West Fork fire, northeast of Pagosa Springs, Colorado, south of Wagon Wheel Gap, and southwest of South Fork, Colorado; the Papoose fire south of Creede, Colorado; and the small Windy Pass fire, near the Wolf Creek ski area. As of the afternoon of July 8: *Papoose: *West Fork Fire: *Windy Pass: Much of the complex was in the Weminuche Wilderness but has burned into surrounding areas in the San Juan and Rio Grande National Forests and private land. The fires, particularly the West Fork fire, burned in dead trees killed by the spruce beetle. Due to the intensity of the West Fork fire which for some days was burning in windy conditions no attempt was made to directly attack it. Aggressive, and so far successful, efforts were made to prevent the Windy Pass fire from reaching the ski area. South Fork and Wagon Wheel Gap were evacuated and U.S. Highway 160 and State Highway 149 were closed to the west of South Fork. Route 160 was reopened at 6 AM June 29; Route 149 was reopened June 30. Most personnel were engaged in structure protection efforts to the west of South Fork, on the low terrain near the Rio Grande River to the north of the fires, and at tourist facilities south of Creede. On the 19th of July when the last incident update was made the fires had a total area of 109,615 acres and were 66% contained with 43 personnel engaged in combating them; the fire was described as \\"smoldering.\\" There are two incident command posts, one in Pagosa Springs, Colorado for the portion of the fire on the west side of the Continental Divide, the other in Del Norte, Colorado for the portion on the east side. As of July 8 the portion of the West Fork fire west of the Continental Divide remained at 0% containment while the portion east of the Continental Divide was 25%. There was about .20 of an inch of precipitation on some parts of the fire June 30 due to a thunderstorm, but strong and erratic winds also stimulated the fire. On July 4, 2013 the fires were described as \\"creeping and smoldering\\" with fire suppression efforts being directed at preventing the expansion of the fire into heavy stands of dead and down fuel. Growth of the fire had continued on the southeastern side of the Papoose fire but as of July 8 widespread showers had moderated fire behavior. As of July 14 humidity was gradually increasing as the monsoon season approached with occasional thunderstorms expected and flash flood warnings issued for the area. As of July 19 precipitation had considerably dampened the fire, but smoldering and smoke continued.

It implemented the 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and to that end it granted the UK courts extraterritorial jurisdiction over offences involving \\"nuclear material used for peaceful purposes.\\"Section 6(1) (Offences involving nuclear weapons are dealt with under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.) The Act has been extensively amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (Schedule 17), which came into force on 30 November 2009.Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (Commencement No.13 and Transitory Provision) Order 2009 The 2008 Act implemented amendments which were made to the Convention in 2005. Provisions According to section 6(1) of the Act, the Act only applies to \\"material which, within the meaning of the Convention, is nuclear material used for peaceful purposes.\\" Schedule 1 to the Act reproduces Article 1 of the Convention, which defines \\"nuclear material\\" in detail. The definition includes certain types of plutonium and uranium (but not thorium). =Sections 1 and 1A= Article 7 of the Convention requires State Parties to create criminal offences prohibiting the use or possession of nuclear material in a way that might cause death or injury, or \\"substantial damage to property,\\" or to steal nuclear material. Section 1 of the Act implements Article 7 by giving the courts of England and Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland the jurisdiction to try certain offences (such as murder and robbery) even if they were committed outside the United Kingdom by people of other nationalities, provided that the offence was committed \\"in relation to or by means of nuclear material\\". If any person is prosecuted for such an offence before a court in any part of the UK, they may be tried and punished for that offence as if they had committed it there. Section 1 was amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 to extend the courts' jurisdiction to try certain offences if they were committed by doing an act directed at a nuclear facility which causes death, injury or damage as a result of radiation or the release of radioactive material, even if done out of the UK and irrespective of the nationality of the person doing it. (Note that the damage does not have to be \\"substantial.\\") The 2008 Act also increased the maximum penalties for some of the offences mentioned in section 1, if they were committed in certain circumstances set out in a new section 1A, to life imprisonment. =Section 1B= Section 1B, inserted by the 2008 Act, makes it an offence for a person of any nationality, and whether in the UK or not, to receive, hold or deal with nuclear material, or do an act directed at a nuclear facility, intending to damage the environment or being reckless as to whether the environment will be damaged. The offence is punishable with life imprisonment. =Section 1C= This section, inserted by the 2008 Act, makes it an offence to be \\"knowingly concerned in\\" the importation or exportation of nuclear material from one country or territory to another, if done in prohibition of the law of that country or territory. The maximum sentence is 14 years. =Section 2= Article 7 of the Convention also required that it should be an offence to threaten to use nuclear material to cause death, injury or substantial damage, or threaten to steal it. Section 2 implemented this part of Article 7 by creating three new offences. However the whole of section 2 was replaced with a new version of section 2, which was substituted by the 2008 Act. The new section 2 creates four offences, which may be committed in the UK or elsewhere and by a person of any nationality: # receiving, holding or dealing with nuclear material for the purpose of causing death, injury or damage; # interfering with a nuclear facility, intending to cause death, injury or damage or being reckless as to whether that would occur; # threatening to cause (by either of the means described above) death, injury, damage to property or damage to the environment, intending that the recipient of the threat will fear that it will be carried out; # threatening to steal nuclear material in order to influence a state, international governmental organisation or person. These offences are punishable by life imprisonment. =Section 2A= This section, inserted by the 2008 Act, extends the jurisdiction of the UK courts to offences of attempting or conspiring to commit an offence covered by section 1 of the Act, or created by sections 1B to 2 of the Act, or inciting such an offence. =Section 3= Section 3 requires that an offence which would not already be an offence but for the Act may not be prosecuted in England and Wales without the permission of the Attorney General for England and Wales, and may not be prosecuted in Northern Ireland without the permission of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland. =Section 3A= Section 3A, inserted by the 2008 Act, states that the 1983 Act does not apply to anything done by the armed forces of any country. =Sections 4, 5 and 6= Section 4 made minor amendments to other legislation. Section 5 was to have implemented Article 11 of the Convention, which required State Parties to make the offences described in Article 7 extraditable offences. However, before the 1983 Act came into force in 1991, section 5 was replaced by the Extradition Act 1989. Section 6 deals with the interpretation of certain provisions of the Act, and allows the Secretary of State to determine whether any nuclear material or nuclear facility was being used for peaceful purposes. His determination is binding on the courts. =Sections 7 and 8= Section 7 authorises the Queen (by Order in Council) to extend the Act to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and any British overseas territory. Section 8 gave the Act its short title, and provided that the Act was to come into force on a date to be appointed by Order in Council. The date appointed was 2 October 1991.

It is the largest religion in Karnataka, the southwest Indian state. Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and many of them have contributed richly to the growth of Hinduism, its temple culture and social development. These developments have reinforced the \\"Householder tradition\\", which is of disciplined domesticity, though the saints who propagated Hinduism in the state and in the country were themselves ascetics. The Bhakti movement, of Hindu origin, is devoted to the worship of Shiva and Vishnu; it had a telling impact on the sociocultural ethos of Karnataka from the 12th century onwards. Movements Karnataka was the birthplace of several notable Hindu movements. The three most prominent movements of Vedanta Hinduism -- Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita‚Äîbegan in Karnataka. The Dvaita Madhvacharya, who was from Karnataka, was the chief proponent of TattvavƒÅda, the \\"philosophy of reality\\". The Advaita Adi Shankara chose Sringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four mathas. The Vishishtadvaita philosopher Ramanuja, considered a saint in Sri Sampradaya, fled from persecution by the Shaiva Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu, and stayed in Karnataka from 1098‚Äì1122. He first lived in Tondanur and then shifted to Melukote where the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple and a well-organised math (religious centre) were established. He was patronized by Hoysala Vishnuvardhana. Udupi, Shringeri, Gokarna and Melukote are also well known places of Sanskrit and Vedic learning. =Lingayatism= Hinduism is the largest religion in Karnataka, followed by Buddhism, Christianity, Jainism, Islam and Sikhism. According to the 2011 census, 84.00% of the state's population practices Hinduism. In the past, Jainism dominated Hinduism. In the 12th century, Lingayatism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of the movement, such as Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu, established the Anubhava Mantapa where Lingayatism was expounded. This was to form the basis of the Lingayat faith and its followers, the Lingayats, account for 17% of the total population of 65 million in Karnataka. When the Lingayat sect came to be established in Karnataka, the then prospering Jain community's practice of Jainism became ineffectual as a religious practice in the state. Ligayats hold a considerable sway in Karnataka to this day. =Bhakti= Kanakadasa one of the famous Haridasas of the Bhakthi movement Under the Bhakti movement, Vishnu and Shiva were the main focus of devotion by both Lingayat and Brahminical communities. The devotional movement in Hinduism is divine grace and is known as the Bhakti movement. Basava (1106‚Äì1167), also called Basavanna, protested against caste system and was for equality among all classes. His movement was called the Bhakti Movement and it had a profound paradigm shift in the socio- cultural ethos of the state of Karnataka. The basic tenet of this philosophy, propounded from the 12th century by the Virashaiva school or Virashaivism, was opposition to the caste system, rejection of the supremacy of the Brahmins, abhorrence to ritual sacrifice, and insistence on Bhakti and the worship of the one God, Shiva. His followers were called Virashaivas, meaning \\"stalwart Shiva-worshipers\\". Before the start of this movement, the Bhakti tradition had taken deep roots in Tamil Nadu which permeated to Karnataka. The Ligayat or Virashaiva sect were the forerunners in this movement. They abhorred caste system and were emphatic to practice the direct interaction with god and symbolically express it through wearing small linga around their neck signifying their faith. The Shaiva Siddhanta, which was practiced in Tamil Nadu and which included tantric practices also formed the base line for the Lingayat religion. But their religious ethos was not to the liking of other Hindu groups. Allama Prabhu a poet saint in the 12th century of the Lingayat sect, was a contemporary of Basava. Allama was instrumental in prompting bhakti cult through his poems in Kannada language among Shiva worshipers. This was an enlightened way of worship in which caste distinctions were discarded. It was believed that Allama was incarnate of Lord Shiva and hence he was given the epithet 'Prabhu' which was suffixed to his name. His poems were totally devotional and expressed in his status of achieving detachment from rituals. Adichunchanagiri Math =Lakula, Kalamukha, and Kapalikas= In Karnataka before the Lingayats' started their bhakthi movement, there was the Kalamukha sect who were worshipers of Shiva. They practiced the movement from the 11th century. They were also opposed to asceticism like the Lingayats. The Kalamukha were a sub-sect of the Lakula Sect, who had lot of influence over the people. They collected funds for their temples and mathas (monastic centers). The Kalamukha ascetic sect was popular during the 9th to 13th centuries, but is now extinct. They painted their faces with a black streak and were contemporary to another sect known as Kapalikas. Their religious dogmas are not clear except for some inscriptions which attest to their strong influence in Karnataka. =Haridasas= Another bhakthi movement established in the 13th century was of Haridasas, a devotional group of saints who formed the group under the same name, and who were Vaishnavites of the Dwiata philosophy. The founder of this movement was Naraharitirtha, a devout Madhva follower. Their worship is devoted to various forms of Lord Vishnu or Hari. This Bhakthi cult's propagation was not only worship of Vishnu but also to discard animal sacrifice, stop beliefs in superstitions, discourage caste system, and end the worship of many forms of the deity. They also discouraged the practice of astrology and other rituals. Their preachings were in the Kannada language through devotional poetry, a language of the people. However, there were two sects in this group one who wanted the Sanskrit language to be followed, the Vyasakuta and the Dasakuta. The notable Haridasas of that period were Purandaradasa, Vyasaraya, Kanakadasa, Vadiraja, Vijaya Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Vasudeva Dasa and Gopala Dasa; many of them became heads of the religious maths founded by Madhva and his disciples. Haridasas are still popular and the songs scripted by many of the earlier Haridasas are very popular. Language Talagunda Pillar inscription dates to the 5th century. Karnataka is one of the four states of South India where Kannada is spoken. It is an ancient language of the Dravidian genre. Spread of Sanskrit in South India as a basic Hindu religious language is evidenced in a stone pillar inscription dated between 455 and 470 AD in Talagunda in Shivamogga district of the state. The inscription is in the language of Kadamba Kakusthavarman; the posthumous record is inscribed in Late southern Brahmi script during the reign of Santivarman (450 to 470 AD). Traditions of Hinduism are practiced in both Sanskrit (considered a superior language) and vernacular languages. The upper castes practice the religion mostly in Sanskrit, whereas the lower-class people practice it in the vernacular language of the region, which constitutes almost 80% of the rural community. Castes During the British Raj the caste classification of the Hindu religion, in their proper hierarchical order, was done in the late 19th century and a publication titled Castes and Tribes of Southern India was published. This monumental work covers all castes in all the states of the then British India; the Bombay state covered the region from Sind in the north (now in Pakistan) to Mysore State (now Karnataka) in the south. Architecture =Chalukya dynasty= One of the seven rivers of India sacred to Hindus is the Kaveri River which has its origin in Karnataka and there are many Hindu tirtha sthanas (sacred sites or places) on its banks. One of the notable thirtha sthanas (religious centre) on the bank of the river is Srirangapattana. The historical site of Aihole is where the Chalukya dynasty ruled in the state from 4th-8th century. They built a large number of Hindu temples, some of which are still extant. This was the period of evolution of Hindu architecture. The architectural style introduced during this period were rock cut architecture in the form of cave temples (chaitya) which comprised an enclosed courtyard called vihara. The earliest temple built was in 450AD which had a square mandapa (pavilion) and a tower (shikara) above the image of the main deity. These became forerunners for later period Hindu temples and resulted in the evolution of Hindu medieval temple architecture. =Hoysala Empire= Th reign of the Hoysala Empire occurred between the 10th and 14th centuries over the western region of Karnataka. Many temples were built with chlorite stones or soapstones and the architecture which evolved was called the Hoysala architecture, known for architectural detailing. The unique features of this style comprise a central hall linked to three star shaped shrines, and the temple towers are laid in horizontal tiers. Dorasamudra, known as Halebid, was the dynastic capital. Hoysaleswara Temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva as the family deity of the Hoysalas. Bittiga, the ruler of the Hoysala empire, converted from Jainism to Hinduism. He was given the name Vishnuvardhana by Ramanuja, one of the three eminent social reformers and religious heads of Hinduism who consecrated the Hoysaleswara Temple built in 1121. Dedicated to Shiva, it has two sanctum sanctorums and the deities are in the form of lingas named Hoysaleshvara and Shantaleshvara, after the king and queen. Built over a period of 70 years, it was left incomplete. It has an enormous Nandi, the mount of Shiva. There is a small Surya (Sun god) temple behind the sanctorum deified with a Surya (Sun) image which is in height. The walls of the temple have been carved with scenes of Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita epics; they are crafted on the external and internal walls, with Yabancharya named as the architect. The town was ravaged by Muslim invaders in 1327. =Vijayanagara Empire= Vijayanagara Empire (\\"city of victory\\") was founded by Harihara in 1336. During the invasion by Bahmani Sultanate (Muslim rulers), Harihara was captured and was converted to Islam, thus becoming an outcast among Hindu religionists. As he grew up, he became a valiant warrior and was sent to conquer South India for the Sultanate. But he decided to establish his own kingdom and reconverted to Hinduism, an indication of religious tolerance that was prevalent during the medieval period; there was no opposition from the orthodoxy. Hampi is another great city of the medieval period where the Vijayanagara empire flourished between 1336 and 1565 and held sway over most of the Indian peninsula; this city was sacked by the invading Muslim army in 1565. =Nagara and Vadara styles= Other temples built are in a blend of Nagara style (north Indian architecture) and Dravidian architecture, also called as Vadara style. One depiction of Vishnu in the state dates back to the 6th century. The Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple in Nandi village is one of the oldest temples in Karnataka dating to the 9th century. The temple, hewn out of rock, comprises two complexes. While the first complex houses three deities, the second complex consists of a huge and majestic kalyani or pond. The foundation of the temple was laid by the Banas of the 9th century. The Chola rulers of the 11th century constructed the roof of the temple. The marriage hall was built by the Hoysalas in the 13th century and a wall of the second complex was built by the Vijayanagar kings. Stone carvings are a popular tourist attraction and are a source of inspiration for students of art and architecture.From Here & There See also * Religion in Karnataka References Bibliography * * ","title":"Hinduism in Karnataka"},{"id":"39784452","text":"Robbie Taylor (born March 31, 1981) is a Canadian former swimmer who specialized in sprint freestyle and backstroke events. He earned a silver medal, as a 17-year-old at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and later represented Canada at the 2000 Summer Olympics. During his sporting career, Taylor trained for the Cobra Swim Club in Brampton, Ontario, under Bill O'Toole, swam for the Texas A&M; Aggies swimming and diving team under head coach Mel Nash, and swam at the Canadian National Sport Centre under legendary coach Paul Bergen. Taylor made his own swimming history at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. There, he shared silver medals with Craig Hutchison, Stephen Clarke and Garrett Pulle in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay with a time of 3:21.27. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Taylor competed only in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay. Teaming with Hutchison, Rick Say and Yannick Lupien in heat three, Taylor swam the second leg and recorded a split of 50.89, but the Canadians came up short to fifth place and thirteenth overall in a final time of 3:21.98. Taylor also sought his bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At the Canadian Olympic Trials, he posted an identical time of 55.53 to share first place with Jake Tapp in the 100-metre backstroke, but missed a chance to snatch his bid from a head-to-head battle in a swimoff.

Dunn served as CEO for eleven years after co-founding the Bonobos brand in 2007. In June 2017, Walmart announced it was purchasing the Bonobos brand for $310 million in cash. Dunn joined Walmart after the purchase to lead the company's collection of direct-to-consumer brands.  Career  = Bonobos = Started by Stanford graduate students Andy Dunn and Brian Spaly, Bonobos was created with the goal to provide men with better- fitting men's pants and a better shopping experience by building the brand on the internet. The company launched with pants that eliminate \\"Khaki Diaper Butt‚Äù and now offers a full line of menswear, including shirts and suits. Bonobos pioneered the internet-driven direct to consumer (DTC), or digitally native vertical brand (DNVB), retail model. The company launched online and was exclusive online for the first few years. It was the first American brand to use the web as the primary means of story-telling, service, commerce and distribution. The innovation led to the birth of an ecosystem, largely based in New York City, of DTC brands, including Warby Parker, Harry's, Glossier, Allbirds, and Away. Core to the idea of DTC brands is bundling product and service together to drive a higher NPS customer experience than legacy brick- and-mortar driven competition can deliver. To deliver the experience, Bonobos created a customer service team in 2008, the Ninjas, located at the Manhattan headquarters of the company. The Ninjas became a key part of the Bonobos experience in serving customers.  Guideshops  In 2011, the company invented a new retail model: apparel stores as fit-to-ship showrooms. The innovation resulted from an experiment in the lobby of the company's headquarters in the Flatiron District of New York. The stores enabled the company to deliver long-tail assortment of size, color, pattern and fit without having to stock inventory. The small footprint stores are called Guideshops, and are an innovation made possible because the core engine of distribution for the brand is on the web. Without inventory in the store, the company's associates, the Guides, are able to focus on customer service. As of 2019, the company had 65 Guideshops.  Investors  The company raised over $100 million in venture capital from investors including Lightspeed, Accel, Forerunner, and Nordstrom. The founding angel investors in the company are Joel Peterson and Andy Rachleff. Lightspeed and Accel co-led the Series A round. At exit, the Board included Jeremy Liew from Lightspeed, Sameer Gandhi from Accel, and Kirsten Green from Forerunner. = Red Swan = In 2011 Dunn cofounded the angel investment firm, Red Swan, which is focused on investing in consumer retail and consumer internet companies. = Early years = Dunn was a consultant for Bain & Company in the US and Latin America following college. His time at Bain included consulting for catalog-based retailer Lands‚Äô End, which served as inspiration for the direct-to-consumer business and customer service model of Bonobos. Afterwards, Dunn worked as a private equity analyst at Wind Point Partners before business school.  Education  Dunn graduated from Northwestern University in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in economics and history. He earned his M.B.A. from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2007.  Personal life  Dunn grew up in Chicago alongside his sister, Monica Royer, founder of Monica + Andy.Andy Dunn: The Founder of Bonobos His mom Usha Ahuja Dunn is an immigrant from India and his father Charles Dunn is the author of The Nurse and the Navigator, a World War II memoir of the wartime romance of his parents. In 2017, Dunn married Manuela Zoninsein, a Brazilian immigrant and sustainability entrepreneur. Dunn and Zoninsein live in New York City.

Background The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around on the Internet. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after the club where he received them, the Boardwalk in Sheffield ‚Äî a since defunct venue where the Arctic Monkeys used to play gigs and Alex Turner used to work. Slowly, as more demos were spread online, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this heading. In a 2005 interview with Prefix Magazine, Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders said: Legacy Many of the songs featured in the collection (tracks 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 14) went on to appear later ‚Äî albeit re-recorded ‚Äî on Arctic Monkeys' debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not.

The novel is a detective story, with its major themes being the September 11 attacks in New York City and the transformation of the world by the Internet. Plot summary The often surreal and dream-like plot of the novel opens on the first day of spring 2001, with Maxine Tarnow walking her two sons to school before going to work. Maxine, ex certified fraud examiner, is approached by Reg Despard regarding suspicious goings-on at hashslingrz, a computer security firm run by Gabriel Ice. She finds much of their financial numbers fail basic plausibility statistics, and notices large payments going to a now defunct website. She talks to an ex-temp for that site, learns they have strong Arab connections and move large sums of money through hawala, and notices she is being tailed afterwards. She talks to Rocky Slagiatt, VC investor behind some of Gabriel's start-ups, who is nervous about where they may be going. Meanwhile, mysterious government heavyweight Nicholas Windust puts pressure on Maxine, asking her to pump her Israeli brother-in-law for information regarding Mossad hacking methods. Maxine's friend March Kelleher is suspicious about the activities of Gabriel Ice, her son-in-law, and asks Maxine to informally interview her daughter Tallis, Gabriel's wife. Tallis does admit to having concerns, but is unwilling to allow any auditing. Rocky introduces Maxine to Igor Dashkov, who asks her about Madoff Securities. A quick scan reveals to Maxine that the numbers are obviously too good to be true. Maxine pays a visit to Darklinear Solutions, another mystery vendor found associated with hashslingrz. She sees Tallis exiting the building, walking a bit; then someone else exiting, proceeding in the opposite direction, getting in a go-go mobile and picking up Tallis, so Maxine trails them. The next morning, Maxine has an unexpected pre- dawn visit from Russian heavy Igor and March. Igor is very thankful, realizing he got out of Madoff Securities in time, and rewards her with illegally unhealthy ice cream. March and Maxine deliver some money to March's ex- husband, Sid, who takes them on his boat for a short drop off, but he is approached by patrol boats and races down the Hudson River, only shaking off his pursuit when he reaches New Jersey near the landfill islands. Maxine receives a videotape which directs her to a Montauk house that suspect Vip Epperdew is known to visit. Epperdew is involved with zapper fraud. Trying to find the exact house, a local informs her the house burned down a few weeks previously, and sneaks her into the mansion Gabriel Ice is building, where he has her help him steal vintage wines. She finds a mysterious code-locked door which she breaks into, leading to a baffling underground complex. The sudden appearance of a strange, short, human-like creature sends her into a panic and she flees in a hurry. Maxine, in following the hashslingrz money, finds some of it is being diverted into Lester Traipse's account. She confronts him, and he is terrified, and intends to return the money, and asks Maxine to arrange terms. She agrees, but next day he is found dead, an apparent suicide. With the help of Conkling Speedwell, a man with a superhuman forensic sense of smell, she learns there is a peculiar mystery scent at the scene of Lester's death. This scent is identified as \\"9:30 Cologne\\", and is soon connected with Windust. The smell also horrifies a friend of Conkling's with a supernatural sense of \\"foresmell\\" who has been smelling not-yet-existent great fires in New York for some time now. Maxine receives a videotape of men apparently rehearsing on the Deseret rooftop the shooting down of a jet plane using a Stinger missile. She attends a humongous dotcom-style-excess party, sponsored by Gabriel Ice on Saturday night, September 8. Everyone is partying like it's 1999. She finds Felix, a teenage programmer also involved with zapper fraud, but he won't say anything about Lester. The following Tuesday, the 9/11 attacks occur. Ex-husband Horst had told Maxine the day before he was going to be working all night, and she now fears the worst. But he and his business partner had watched Monday Night Football and fell asleep, and next morning joined the masses seeking refuge in New Jersey, and was unable to get through. March, a blogger, leans towards low-level conspiracy theories (but nothing close to truther ideas). Maxine takes Horst back. Eric and Driscoll, two programmers, move in with them as temporarily homeless. March finds herself hunted and homeless, but she keeps up her blog using WiFi. Gabriel breaks up with Tallis. Justin and Lucas, designers of the open-source program DeepArcher, find their work a home for numerous 9/11 ghosts. Maxine finds Windust's murdered body, and refuses to get involved. The Russians try a vircator attack on a Gabriel server farm. The book ends with few resolutions.

Critical reception Bleeding Edge received generally positive reviews from critics.

Bleeding Edge is mellow, plummy, minor-key Pynchon, his second such in a row since Against the Day (2006)... but in its world-historical savvy, its supple feel for the joys and stings of love--both married and parental--this new book is anything but minor. On the contrary, Bleeding Edge is a chamber symphony in P major, so generous of invention it sometimes sprawls, yet so sharp it ultimately pierces.\\" Michael Jarvis in his review for the Los Angeles Review of Books compared it to modern day cyberpunk literature and wrote, \\"... all its exuberant visions of transcending the body through cyberspace ‚Äî lay a deep anxiety about what it would mean to ‚Äúvalue the virtual world more‚Äù than the material one, perhaps even to lose the ability to discern or enforce the boundaries between the two. Bleeding Edge manifests, with exquisite poignancy, the full human dimensions of those concerns.\\" Stuart Kelly for The Scotsman called it \\"unequivocally a masterpiece.\\" Critic Michiko Kakutani, reviewing Bleeding Edge for The New York Times, called it \\"Pynchon Lite\\", and \\"a scattershot work that is, by turns, entertaining and wearisome, energetic and hokey, delightfully evocative and cheaply sensational; dead-on in its conjuring of zeitgeist-y atmospherics, but often slow-footed and ham-handed in its orchestration of social details.\\" It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction.Julie Boseman, \\"Finalists for National Book Awards Announced\\", New York Times, October 16, 2013.

Construction The Mansfield Lines Act of 8 July 1865 authorised the construction of the branch, along with others in the area which was undergoing rapid industrialisation, especially in the coal and iron industries. The line was built by the Midland Railway from Seymour Junction[ Seymour Junction by map and satellite] on their Doe Lea Valley line to Creswell Junction,[ Creswell Junction by map and satellite] immediately north of Elmton and Creswell on their to line, now known as the Robin Hood Line. It was physically completed by January 1872, but not opened throughout until 1 June 1875 and then only for freight, the sole traffic up to that point being coal from Barlborough Colliery. The branch served three collieries ‚Äì Oxcroft, Barlborough and SouthgateClowne Branch with colliery to the right: via picturethepast ‚Äì and one station, initially called Clown (\\"e\\" was only added to the village and its railway features in the 20th Century) but was later renamed twice, becoming in 1951. The primary purpose of the line was to give access from the east to the booming coal and iron industries in the Staveley area. The line was steeply graded from both ends to its summit at Clowne. It had no tunnels, but required three substantial cuttings and a embankment. Further significant work occurred in the late 1960s when it was bridged by the new M1 Motorway.[ M1 Bridge over Clowne Branch by map and satellite] Between 1896 and 1900 the LD&ECR; built their Beighton Branch which both adjoined and crossed the Clowne Branch in Clowne. Relations between the Midland Railway and the new company were good. A connection was laid between the two lines in Clowne, running north west to south east, some distance east of both companies' stations. It was only ever used for freight and closed in 1937. The line has the Engineer's Line Reference (ELR) BAC3.ELR Codes and Descriptions: via www.railwaycodes.org.uk Codes beginning \\"BAC3\\" appear on structures such as bridges which remain Network Rail's responsibility, even though tracks have been lifted. Passenger services Passenger services commenced on 1 November 1888, thirteen years after opening and sixteen years after physical completion. Three trains a day plied between Mansfield and Chesterfield, calling at all stations via Elmton and Creswell, Clown, Netherthorpe, Staveley and . A common thread between these stations is that every one of them was subsequently renamed at least once or, in the case of Whittington, relocated. The time taken for this sinuous journey was about an hour. By 1922 five trains a day, Monday to Saturday, plied the route, but this was the high-water mark. By 1952 only one train each way, Monday to Friday, served Clowne and Barlborough, timed to suit schools. That was withdrawn on 5 July 1954. The station's goods facilities closed in July 1960, leaving its sole purpose excursions, such as for football matches, and Summer Saturday holiday traffic, notably from to . That called for the last time on 18 August 1962. The last steam train to use the line was a non-stop enthusiasts' special on 16 October 1965. This train also traversed the Doe Lea Branch. Freight Freight was always the line's primary purpose. Barlborough Colliery ceased production in 1921 and Southgate followed in 1929. Oxcroft Colliery, at Stanfree, survived until 27 February 1976. After it closed its facilities for loading coal onto trains were retained and developed as the \\"Oxcroft Disposal Point\\"Oxcroft Disposal Point in late BR days: via wikimedia for opencasted coal. The site had something of a Red Letter Day on 9 May 1992 when Class 58 locomotive 58 044 was ceremonially named \\"Oxcroft Opencast\\". The site continued in railway use until Spring 2006, latterly to load coal opencasted from Arkwright colliery and brought to Oxcroft by road. This coal came off the short Oxcroft Branch at Oxcroft Colliery Branch Junction and traversed the Clowne branch for less than a mile to Seymour Junction, heading westwards. The track and loading equipment at Oxcroft DP was protected for some time, but by 20 July 2013 the track had been lifted and all structures had been demolished, though no attempt had been made to landscape the site or remove roadways. Otherwise light engine movements to and from Shirebrook Diesel Depot became the sole regular through traffic, supplemented by occasional freights and power station coal diversions.mgr train coming off the Clowne Branch at Creswell Junction: via flickr This continued until the 1990s when an underground fire threatened to undermine the line, compounded by the expensive need to replace the points at Creswell Junction. These points were replaced by plain line, as were those at Oxcroft Colliery Junction. Superb images of the area are available on lineOxcroft No.3 Signalbox: via signalboxes but note that, as the aerial view on the site shows, \\"Oxcroft Colliery No 3\\" signalbox was near Barlborough Colliery, not Oxcroft Colliery. At 20 July 2013 the track between Oxcroft and Creswell had been lifted and piles of concrete sleepers had been placed beneath overbridges in Clowne and Woodthorpe Road (between Shuttlewood and Mastin Moor) to deter wheeled access. Structures such as overbridges had clearly been maintained. Future use In 2016, the line was purchased from Network Rail by Derbyshire County Council for future development into a greenway for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Planning permission was grantedhttps://apps.derbyshire.gov.uk/applications/planning- applications/profile.asp?AppType=1&AppCode;=CD5/0817/39 in October 2017 for Derbyshire County Council to develop the disused railway to full greenway standard and connect the eastern end into an access point through a development near to Creswell station, while the western end is now connected to the northern part of the Markham Employment Growth Zone (MEGZ) development and onward into Poolsbrook country park. Funding to undertake the physical works is still being sought but as an interim measure local volunteers keep the line passable by walkers and cyclists by regularly clearing overgrowth and picking litter. A condition of the planning application protects the interests of HS2, which has an intention to use the most westerly section of the line as access from the main HS2 line to a maintenance depot proposed at Staveley. It is hoped that an alternative route for the greenway would be constructed if this proposal progresses. References =Notes= =Sources=    External links *The Clowne Branch on old O.S.

The Russians managed to rout the Ottoman army, scoring a major victory. This battle, alongside several others in this campaign, established the reputation of the Russian general Alexander Suvorov as one of the brilliant commanders of his time. The Ottoman forces are estimated at about 40,000. Russian numbers were much lower, 8,000 men in total. The Ottoman forces were demoralized due to previous defeats and had poor logistics (including a year of withheld back pay). The Russian army under Generals Alexander Suvorov and Mikhail Kamensky encountered the Ottoman forces of General Abdul-Rezak Pasha. After scouts reported to Suvorov, he immediately ordered the attack. The Russian army, divided into four squares, attacked the Ottomans. Ottoman cavalry charges were repulsed by the Russians, while a Russian cavalry attack from the rear resulted in the capture of all of the Ottoman artillery. Russian artillery fire is also said to have been highly devastating to the Ottoman forces. Casualties were 3,000 for the Ottomans and 209 for the Russians. The Russians captured the Ottoman camp with its supplies, while the Ottomans abandoned Kozludzha and retreated to Shumla, where they were soon blockaded, suffering from further defeats and attrition. The Russian victory was one of the major reasons why a month later, on 21 July, the Ottomans were forced to sign the unfavorable Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca.

Formed in the spring of 2005 by students Mayank Prasad, Raksha Soora, and Manoj Nair, Dhamakapella's music has been influenced from both Eastern and Western elements, and mixes contemporary Western songs with popular Eastern music. Since Dhamaka's inception in 2005, the group has recorded and produced albums, EPs, and singles composed entirely of original arrangements written by current members of the group or alumni. As CWRU's largest competitive a cappella group, the group competes nationally and has won fifteen national titles. Career Dhamakapella was formed in 2005 by student Mayank Prasad at Case Western Reserve University. With help from students Raksha Soora and Manoj Nair, Mayank organized and established the first university-recognized coed a cappella group, which would feature genres from both Western and Eastern cultures. Within three years, Dhamakapella grew into a sixteen-member group, with singers of various and diverse styles. Due to the nontraditional arrangements and unique compositions, the group instantly stood out both on campus and in downtown Cleveland. Dhamakapella began nationally competing in the fall of 2011, becoming Case Western Reserve University's sole competitive a cappella group on campus. By 2016, they had already won six national titles at various competitions across the country. In 2017, after winning another 3 national titles, Dhamakapella was one of seven teams to qualify for the first- ever South Asian fusion a cappella bid-style championship, All-American Awaaz (A3), where they placed 3rd and won \\"Best Arrangement\\" for their arrangement of \\"Man Mandira\\". In 2018, Dhamakapella qualified again for A3 after holding the top spot in the bid point rankings for the entire season. They placed 2nd and received two individual awards. In 2019, in addition to qualifying yet again for A3, Dhamakapella entered the International Competition of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) circuit in their local Midwest region for the first time. They were accepted into Quarterfinals where they placed 2nd and qualified for the Midwest Semifinal in St Louis, Missouri. In 2011, Dhamakapella released its debut album Pehli Nazar: First Look, and in 2015 released its sophomore album Naya Zamana / Welcome to the New Age, following the group's growing popularity across the city and the University.

Usage  The structure of the Landst√§nde was highly variable depending on the country and period of history. Furthermore, both the representatives of the older system, the St√§ndeordnung, where the estates were predominant, and the parliaments of the newer people's representative systems were called Landst√§nde. The term Landtag was used, both under the St√§ndeordnung as well as the newer representative structures, for a general assembly of the estates or the parliament. The totality of the Landst√§nde in a sovereign territory was also called the Landschaft. In the older feudal system the estates originally consisted of the assembly of deputies of the privileged estates of a country, the nobility and the clergy, who had joined together to form an organised body. Later, representatives of the towns were added. In some cases (for example, in Vienna, W√ºrttemberg or Mecklenburg) yeomen (Freibauer) were also given the right to participate as representatives of the peasants.Herders Conversations-Lexikon. Freiburg im Breisgau 1855, Vol. 3, p. 704. An unusual exception were the estates in the land of Hadler, which were formed almost exclusively of the farmers of large farms (Gro√übauer).Eduard R√ºther: ‚ÄûHadler Chronik. Quellenbuch zur Geschichte des Landes Hadeln.‚Äú 1932. Neu heraus gegeben Bremerhaven 1979. pp. 37 ff At the Landtage the Landst√§nde were divided into separate curiae (divisions). As a rule, three curiae were usually distinguished: the prelates, the knights and the towns.G√∂tzinger, E.: Reallexicon der Deutschen Altert√ºmer. Leipzig, 1885., pp. 943-944. However, the early Landst√§nde initially only represented the rights of their own estate and could only indirectly be considered to represent the whole population in their domain at the same time. In the St√§ndeordnungen, unlike absolutist systems of rule, the prince could not raise new taxes or adopt new laws outside his own personal estate (chamber goods or K√§mmerg√ºter) without the consent of the Landst√§nde. In some cases, the estates also shared in the administration of justice and other public affairs. The limits of their powers were not usually accurately determined. Sometimes the term Landst√§nde was retained even for the constitutional assemblies of newer representative systems, which in many countries took the place of the privileged assemblies of the St√§ndeordnung during the 19th century.Peter Michael EHRLE: Volksvertretung im Vorm√§rz. Studien zur Zusammensetzung, Wahl und Funktion der deutschen Landtage im Spannungsfeld zwischen monarchischem Prinzip und st√§ndischer Repr√§sentation, 2 Bde., Frankfurt a. M., 1979 [=Europ. Hochschulschriften III/127].  History  = Precursor = The Landst√§nde first emerged in the 14th century, although the term itself was not used in Middle High German and was probably first translated later from the French word √©tats. But it was not a new concept. The records of the Roman historian, Tacitus, show that co-determination was already being practised in the classical period at important public occasions. And according to the old Germanic law, public meetings and court hearings - the so-called things - were held, in the open. Even in the later Frankish Empire, alongside the general assemblies of the nobility and clergy, so-called placita are recorded; a form of representation of the people. In individual tribes, for example the Bavarians and Saxons, there were such meetings too. However, these gatherings did not represent a formal grouping of the estates, as had evolved by the 14th century. Even the imperial and knightly assemblies and the state things of the 12th and 13th centuries were structures that dealt with the general welfare of the land, but these meetings still lacked the character of an independent body.

Part of the hospital has been converted to residential accommodation and the remainder has been demolished. History =Origins= St Lawrence's Hospital was originally built as the Cornwall County Asylum in 1818 to the design of architect John Foulston in the form of a star-shaped building with a central block and radiating wings. Now a Grade II* listed building, it was designed to deal with the problem of housing the insane poor and inmate conditions were notoriously bad. It was extended in 1844 by the construction of the three-storey \\"High Building\\", demolished in 1964, and again in 1849 by the construction of Williams House, which was converted into apartments in 2004. A third extension, built in 1860, was known as the Carew building after the Rt Hon Reginald Pole Carew, a local politician. A fourth extension, built in 1870, was known as the Long Building (later the Kendall Building) and was also demolished after it burned down in 1905. The foundation stone for a new building, constructed at a cost of ¬£12,000, was laid by Sir William Wallace Rhoderic Onslow, Bt on 28 August 1882. The architect was a Mr Hine. In 1840 William Robert Hicks was appointed domestic superintendent of the Cornwall county lunatic asylum, clerk of the asylum, and clerk to the committee of visitors at Bodmin, and soon after was also named clerk to the highway board. The Earl of Devon afterwards procured for him the additional situation of auditor of the metropolitan district asylums. When Hicks became connected with the Bodmin asylum he found the old system of management prevailing, and in conjunction with the medical superintendent introduced more humane modern methods. One patient who was chained in a dark cell as a dangerous lunatic turned out to be a wit and a philosopher. He was found to be harmless, and employed to take care of the pigs and do other useful work. He was‚Äîaccording to the Dictionary of National Biography‚Äîa very good man of business. He printed Statistics respecting the Food supplied to Paupers in the Western Unions of Cornwall. =Expansion= Silvanus Trevail, architect (1851‚Äì1903) A completely new building to stand to the west of the first was designed in 1901 by Silvanus Trevail (1851‚Äì1903), one of Cornwall's best-known architects.Private Eye 1343, p.14 The building was not completed until 1906, three years after the architect's death. Described by Trevail's biographer as \\"one of his finest achievements\\", it was built in the Edwardian Baroque style. The National Asylum Workers' Union organised a strike of female employees at the hospital in 1918. The whole complex was renamed the St Lawrence's Hospital when it joined the National Health Service in 1948. =Post war= This was one of the hospitals investigated in 1967 as a result of the publication of Barbara Robb's book Sans Everything. Evidence was given by a nursing assistant: \\"When I was new on my ward, and not been issued with a uniform, one old lady said to me ‚ÄòYou aren‚Äôt a nurse, dear; you can‚Äôt be. You don‚Äôt hit us or shout at us‚Äô. Another said ‚ÄòNo-one smiles here. We are no good in here; useless, bloody wets‚Äô\\". After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and finally closed in 2002. The former hospital's owners, Community First Cornwall, wished to demolish the Foster building to clear the site. Despite local support for its preservation, English Heritage declined a request to list the building on the grounds of insufficient reason.This is Cornwall, May 1 2013. Retrieved June 2013 In May 2013 Cornwall Council decided that the demolition of the building did not require an environmental impact assessment, removing one of the last remaining obstacles to its removal. Although the Foster Hall Revival Trust began a campaign aimed at preserving the building and proposing alternatives to demolition, demolition started in September 2013.

A. degree at Trinity College, Oxford; removing to King's College, Cambridge, he proceeded to M.A. in 1713, and again changed to Oxford for his B.D. and D.D. degrees, the last being taken in 1723. Bishop Gibson, to whom he was chaplain, gave him the prebend of Erpingham in Lincoln Cathedral in 1721, the prebend of Buckden in 1726, resigned 1727; a prebend in St. Paul's, the united rectories of St. Austin and St. Faith, with that of Acton, Middlesex, in 1730; the chaplaincy to George II, 1730; and the archdeaconry of London, in which he succeeded Dr. Tyrwhitt, in 1742. He published nine sermons separately. One, delivered at St. James's before George II in 1748, led eventually to the resignation of his chaplaincy. He published it in self- defence in 1749, under the title 'A Persuasive to Chastity.' It had been censured, and the preacher had been lampooned in a court ballad]. Dr. Whiston calls it 'that seasonable and excellent sermon' delivered 'when crime between the sexes was at its greatest height.' In 1748, he published a volume entitled 'Poems on several Occasions,' London, 8vo, printed for the widow of a clergyman, formerly his curate. In this work he eulogises Stephen Duck's poetic fame, glorifies somebody's squirrel and a lady's canary, and laments over a dead cow. He fell from his horse in 1749, and seriously impaired his memory. In 1751, he was elected president of Sion College, and in 1752 resigned his warrant for chaplain. He says all his preferments together did not amount to ¬£350. a year clear. Soon after he met with losses of ¬£2,000. His earliest works were: 'A Letter from a Minister to his Parishioners,' London, 1718, 8vo, and 'A Poem on the Death of . . . Addison,' London, 1720, 8vo. In 1753, appeared 'Concio ad Clerum,' and in 1755 'An Essay tending to promote Religion,' London, 8vo, a curious piece, half prose, half verse, clearly showing his disappointment at not having a canonry of St. Paul's to add to the archdeaconry. He speaks of his chaplaincy, and affirms that the sum total of reward received for his twenty-two years' service was one meal a fortnight and no salary. In 1756, he published 'A Poem sacred to the Memory of Queen Anne for her Bounty to the Clergy,' London, 4to. In 1757, he published a collection called 'Twenty-eight Discourses on various Subjects and Occasions,' London, 4to, and the next year, when residing at Acton, he republished the whole of his works, under the title of 'Discourses and Essays in Prose and Verse by Edward Cobden, D.D., arch-deacon of London, and lately chaplain,' &c.; Cobden died on 22 April 1764.

The index is weighted using data provided by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on total foreign exchange (FX) trading volume. The index rises when the U.S. dollar gains value against the other currencies, and falls when the U.S. dollar loses value against the currencies. The methodology and data used for the index set it apart from several existing metrics, such as the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index and FTSE Curex USD/G8 Index. The WSJ Dollar Index is a trade weighted index but unlike some of the other metrics, the WSJ Dollar Index captures the impact of capital flows on currency volumes, a significant determinant of currency market activity. History The WSJ Dollar index was created in 2012 with the aim of improving on the previous US Dollar indices by using a different calculation and more currencies. Wall Street Journal issued a press release for the index on July 18, 2012. The index was developed by Stephen Bernard and Vincent Cignarella, at the time members of the news team for Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal and DJ FX Trader, a joint product of Dow Jones & Co. and The Wall Street Journal. Bernard and Cignarella discussed the index launch on WSJ.com's Markets Hub. The pair also wrote about the index for The Wall Street Journal and WSJ.com.  Components & Methodology  The triennial foreign exchange turnover survey published by the BIS provides the basis for weighting the WSJ Dollar Index. The BIS includes data on major currency pairs as defined by the organization's most recent triennial report (currency pairs they break out as individual pairs, which has grown in each successive report). Each dollar pair that constitutes at least 1% of global currency turnover is included in the index, and weighted based on their proportion of volume within the group of currency pairs used in the index. The index was updated in December 2013 with the release of the latest survey. The index now includes 16 dollar currency pairs, up from seven in the previous iteration. Mexico's peso, China's yuan, Russia's ruble, Turkey's lira, South Korea's won, South Africa's rand and New Zealand's, Hong Kong's and Singapore's dollars are now all included in the index for the first time. The 16 currencies used in the index accounted for 80% of the $5.3 trillion daily trading in global foreign exchange markets. Initially at launch, the WSJ Dollar Index currently tracked seven foreign currencies, including the euro (EUR), yen (JPY), pound sterling (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), Swiss franc (CHF), Canadian dollar (CAD), and Swedish krona (SEK). All seven currencies remain in the current version of the index. Combined the seven currency pairs accounted for more than two-thirds of daily global foreign exchange trading volume at the time the index was initially launched. The index is re-weighted after the close on the first Friday following the release of the BIS‚Äôs triennial survey. The latest triennial survey was published in December 2013. The WSJ Dollar Index differs from the other metrics in that the index is consistently updated every three years.

Life He was born in 1786 in London. His father, whom in an account of his life which he supplied to the 'Dublin Theatrical Observer,' 1821-2, he vaguely describes as 'distinguished as an algebraist, mathematician, and architectural draughtsman,' died young, and Cobham was apprenticed by his mother to a printer. He rose to be reader and corrector for the press, and came into some relations with Malone, an edition of whose 'Shakespeare' he ; read 'for the printers. He first appeared as an amateur in Lamb's Conduit Street as Shylock, a part in which George Frederick Cooke had greatly impressed him. His first professional essay was at Watford, Hertfordshire. He subsequently played in various country towns, taking, like Kean, every part, from leading tragedian to harlequin. At Salisbury he married Miss Drake, an actress of the Salisbury Theatre. When playing at Oxford, Cobham, with his wife, was engaged by Penley for the theatre in Tottenham Street, where he appeared with much success as Marmion in a dramatisation by William Oxberry of Scott's poem. He then went to the Surrey Theatre, and thence to the Royalty. On 16 April 1816 he appeared as Richard III at Covent Garden. That the experiment was a failure was in part ascribed to the supporters of Kean, and especially to the club known as 'The Wolves.' Hazlitt, however, who was present on the occasion, declares his Richard to have been 'a vile one,' a caricature of Kean, and continues : The 'Theatrical Inquisitor' (April 1816), on the other hand, says of his performance that 'it was good very good,' and censures the audience for taking a cowardly advantage and condemning him before he was heard. The performance was repeated with some success on 22 April 1816, and Cobham then disappeared from the West-end. In 1817, he appeared at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, as Sir Giles Overreach, playing afterwards Macbeth, and Richard. He was in Dublin in 1821-2, a member of the Hawkins Street stock company, dividing with Warde the principal characters of tragedy. After Warde's disappearance he played, in the memorable engagement of Kean in July 1822, Richmond, Iago, Edgar in Lear, and the Ghost in Hamlet. Early in his career Cobham played at Woolwich, at the Navy Tavern, Glenalvon to the Young Norval of Kean. Subsequently, at the Coburg Theatre the two actors met once more, Kean playing Othello, and Cobham Iago. The reception of Kean on this occasion by the transpontine public, the faith of which in Cobham was never shaken, was unfavourable. A full account of the scene of Kean's indignation and Cobham's speech to the audience appears in Cole's Life of Charles Kean, i. 161-3. Cobham had some resemblance in appearance and stature to Kean, being dark, with flexible features, and about five feet five inches in height. In spite of Hazlitt's unfavourable verdict, he was a fair actor, a little given to rant, and to so-called and not very defensible 'new readings.' In the 'Dramatic Magazine,' ii. 210, he is placed in respect of genius above all actors of the day except Kean, Young, Macready, and Charles Kemble. It is there also said that 'the modern stage affords few efforts of genius superior to his acting in the last scene of \\"Thirty Years of a Gambler's Life.\\"' A coloured print of Cobham as Richard III was published in Dublin, presumably in 1821. In his later life he rarely quit the transpontine stage. He died on 3 Jan. 1842, leaving a son and a daughter on the stage. The latter acted under the name of Mrs. Fitzgerald.

Early years Antoine Redier was born on 7 July 1873 in Meudon, the eldest of eight children of Jean R√©dier and his wife Anna Thubert. He was grandson of the watchmaker Jean Antoine Joseph Redier. He wrote many books, including M√©ditations dans la tranch√©e (1916), which won an awards from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. After World War I, R√©dier became the leader of a veterans group, and was the editor of the Revue fran√ßaise. He was nationalist, anti-communist and socially conservative. He believed in the virtues of a family unit headed by a patriarch, and generally believed in the virtues of anti-Republican virility. He supported the proposals of Fernand Boverat for family suffrage, which would enhance the status of the father in the family. Political career Redier founded the L√©gion, or Ligue, in 1924. Although the goals were obscure, R√©dier expected that the veterans would take power, and a leader (chef) would emerge. The ligue had 10,000 members, with sections in the main provincial centers. From 15,000 to 20,000 copies of the movement's newspaper, Le Rassemblement. were printed each week. The L√©gion was in favor of a corporatist system of government and attacked the left and democracy. Its program said it stood \\"above the interests of a single group\\" and would \\"gather all those ... who put the salvation of France above all else.\\" General √âdouard de Curi√®res de Castelnau, President of the F√©d√©ration Nationale Catholique provided funding to R√©dier's L√©gion and to the Jeunesses Patriotes founded by Pierre Taittinger. The L√©gion merged into the Jeunesses Patriotes on 1 July 1925, bringing a more extreme element into Taittinger's vaguely right-wing organization. Redier became vice-president of the merged organization, and began to radicalize the organization. When Georges Valois launched his rival Faisceau organization, R√©dier was in favor of a merger. Large numbers of Ligue members did desert to the Faisceau. By 15 December Redier had left the Jeunesses patriotes, and urged all L√©gion members to follow his lead. He intended to transfer to the Faisceau, but held back, perhaps because of an ongoing struggle between Fasceau and the Action Fran√ßaise. In March 1926 Redier again called for his remaining followers to join Faisceau, before retiring from politics after Faisceau promised to support his career as a writer. Later years Redier continued to be a prolific author, although his work was not exceptional. His book La Guerre des femmes (1923) had won an award from the Academy. This book, which recorded the lives of women fighters such as Louise de Bettignies, was the basis for the 1937 film S≈ìurs d'armes by L√©on Poirier. The role of Louise was played by Jeanne Sully. His Jeanne de France (1950) also won an award from the Academy. Redier died on 27 July 1954 in Paris.
