He was provost of the collegiate chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and vice-chancellor between 1243 and 1251, and bishop of P√©cs from 1251 until his death in 1252. Life Achilles was one of the five children of P√°zm√°ny from the kindred Hont-P√°zm√°ny. Although the genus Hont-P√°zm√°ny was one of the most illustrious clans in the Kingdom of Hungary, its √öjhely branch from which Achilles descended was less prosperous. The small family lands were located in the region of the rivers Beretty√≥ and K√∂r√∂s. All the same, Achilles was admitted to the royal court sometime after 1225, where he was employed as royal chaplain. His early career is uncertain, because there were four namesake prelates in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1230s and 1240s. He can most probably be identified with one Achilles, provost of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom from around 1236. When the Mongols invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241, this Achilles fled to Dalmatia similarly to King B√©la IV of Hungary. Since Archbishop Matthias R√°t√≥t of Esztergom was killed by the Mongols in the Battle of Mohi, Achilles administered the archdiocese for more than two years. Following the withdrawal of the Mongols Provost Achilles was at least twice appointed by the pope to investigate the circumstances of appointments to higher Church offices. Achilles himself was transferred to the collegiate chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in September 1243. Head of the prestigious chapter, Achilles also became the vice-chancellor, the leader of the royal administration. The royal chancery started to function more uniformly under his auspices, and the registration of the charters issued by the chancery was also begun in this period. King B√©la IV of Hungary granted him a landed property in Ugocsa County which suggests that the monarch also respected Achilles's work. When Bishop Bartholomew le Gros of P√©cs retired in 1251, King B√©la IV recommended Achilles to his place. Respecting the monarch's wish, the canons of the cathedral chapter of P√©cs elected Achilles bishop. The pope confirmed his election by November 23, 1251. The new bishop visited the monastery his predecessor had established for hermits on the Saint James Hill at P√©cs and personally marked out the borders of its nearby properties. He also promised to make further donations to the community, but he unexpectedly died in the first months of 1252. He left his lands in Ugocsa to his relatives. References * Koszta, L√°szl√≥ (2009).

Connecticut, in which contraception for married couples was legalized in the state of Connecticut, setting the precedent of the right to privacy. Griswold served as the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood in New Haven when she and Yale professor C. Lee Buxton opened a birth control clinic in New Haven in an attempt to change the Connecticut law banning contraception. Their actions set into motion legislation that resulted in both Poe v. Ullman and Griswold v. Connecticut. Griswold's personal role in both cases was vital to achieving success and starting a women's rights revolution that went on to aid the support for such cases as Roe v. Wade. Early life Estelle (\\"Stelle\\") Trebert was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on June 8, 1900 to Frank (a toolmaker of Irish and German descent) and Jennie Church Trebert. Throughout Estelle‚Äôs childhood, her father educated her thoroughly in Native American customs and strongly advocated for outdoor activity. Her mother, Jennie Trebert, is most commonly described as being reserved and \\"placid.\\" Estelle was the younger of two surviving children (a brother had died before she was born); her older brother was Raymond Trebert. Their parents were said to have had a tumultuous marriage and serious \\"personality differences\\", but they never were divorced. Estelle Griswold was raised in the Roman Catholic faith but was not devout later in life. Estelle attended Hartford public schools throughout her youth. Due to academic process, she skipped both fourth and seventh grades but was graduated from high school in five years instead of four due to her habitual truancy and her encouragement of other students, mainly boys, to skip school. After graduation from high school in 1920, Estelle began taking music classes at the Hartt School of Music. She wanted to go to college and further her academic career, but her family could not afford the tuition. She worked in a bank in order to pay for the music school. In 1922, she moved to France to pursue a singing career, ignoring the disapproval of her parents. She had a very impressive contralto singing voice, and traveled to both Paris and Nice for employment. While in France, Estelle contracted tuberculosis, limiting her abilities to work. She also became engaged to an aspiring playwright, but the relationship ended prior to the marriage. Upon learning that her mother had fallen seriously ill, Estelle left Paris. Soon thereafter, both her parents died. Estelle did not return to Paris after their deaths but stayed in Hartford. Hoping to further her singing career, she did travel briefly, auditioning in New York and touring for six months with a Chicago-based show group. After this, she returned to Hartford and remained there until her marriage to Richard Griswold. Marriage Estelle married Richard \\"Dick\\" Whitmore Griswold (b. Feb. 11, 1898 - d. Oct. 1, 1966) on October 20, 1927 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The two had both attended Hartford High School, Richard being two years her senior. Though they were not close friends, they knew each other during their school years. Upon graduating from high school, he attended Yale University and spent a brief time in service during World War I. He went on to work in advertising, traveling throughout New York and New England for various jobs. After Estelle's return from France, they met again, beginning a relationship, and marrying in the fall of 1927. Due to this, Richard Griswold decided to take a job with the Guardian Life Insurance Agency, which offered him a salaried position. They briefly moved to New York, commuting from Mount Vernon to New York City for Richard‚Äôs business and Estelle's singing jobs. Griswold took a job as a radio singer for such broadcasts as the NBC Red Network in 1929. In 1935, Richard and Estelle Griswold moved from Connecticut to Washington D.C. where Estelle began taking classes at George Washington University. While in D.C., Griswold decided to end her singing career, given that her tutor had died, and she instead began studying medicine. Her advancement in the subject led her to become a medical instructor with the university. Life abroad At the beginning of World War II, Richard Griswold left his advertising business and joined the Office of Political Affairs in the State Department, during which time he was sent abroad to Europe to help with various crises. In 1945, Griswold joined him in Europe, becoming involved with humanitarian efforts, including the aid of refugees, mainly from Eastern European countries. In attempting to gain employment at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), however, she was turned down. Eventually, Griswold managed to bypass the initial employment offices and went straight to the top of the organization in order to achieve employment. In doing so, she became involved with the resettlement plan in Europe to aid refugees and send them away to such places as Rio de Janeiro, Algiers, and Puerto Rico. Throughout this time, Griswold witnessed deep poverty and starvation, and realized that the cause of this was, ultimately, overpopulation, as there was no access to birth control in these countries. This realization fueled Griswold's beliefs that women should be granted access to contraception to protect themselves, as they often faced the challenge of giving in to their husbands and dealing with an unwanted pregnancy or refusing them and suffering often abusive consequences. Griswold ended her time with the Church World Service in 1951, feeling that the organization was not properly aiding refugees, instead being crass in their efforts. New Haven Planned Parenthood Upon returning to the United States in 1950, Richard and Estelle moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Richard Griswold decided to continue working as an advertising executive and believed that moving to New Haven would be beneficial due to the appeal he could draw from the Yale community. During this time, Estelle became the Executive Secretary to the Human Relations Council, a volunteer job that she did for free. In addition to this, she helped fund the infertility program and the marital counseling program at Yale, the latter of which was run by the wife of lawyer Fowler Harper, who would play a large role in the legislation for Griswold v. Connecticut. Her role in these programs was fueled through both her knowledge of population gained from experience abroad, as well as her empathy towards couples who, like her, could not have children. Richard and Estelle lived at 40 Trumbull Street, directly next to Planned Parenthood‚Äôs New Haven offices at the time, where they became familiar with various people throughout the building. Within the organization, many had been attempting to formulate new legislation to challenge the 1879 Connecticut law banning the use of contraception, facing challenges and scrutiny from many conservative organizations. It became clear that they would need a figurehead to operate the plan in order to attempt success who would be more docile than the radical liberals the courts were expecting. Griswold was quickly considered for involvement, as many knew her from her work in the Human Relations Council and understood her political platforms. The idea to involve Griswold came initially from a chance encounter with Jennie Heiser, assistant to the soon- to-be-retired Planned Parenthood Executive Director Nancy Williams, who half- jokingly offered her the upcoming position. Griswold was, at first, reluctant to accept the position. She did not have a great deal of knowledge regarding birth control and did not know what a diaphragm was upon her first interview with PPLC President Molly Milmine, though diaphragms were the main source of birth control during the era. Overcoming these challenges, she finally accepted the position in late 1953, as she desperately needed a paying job, given that Richard Griswold had been diagnosed with emphysema in 1953 and could not work as frequently as he had in previous years. On January 1, 1954, Griswold began her work as Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. Among her duties was the practice of organizing ‚Äúborder runs‚Äù in which women would be taken to New York or Rhode Island in order to seek the proper birth control methods that were unavailable to them in Connecticut. Poe v. Ullman Shortly after Griswold became Executive Director, she became involved in the movement to abolish the birth control laws within Connecticut. An 1879 law outlawing the sale or manufacture of contraception had been upheld since its enactment, despite constant protest shown at several state legislative meetings within the decades since. The law was sponsored by State legislator P.T. Barnum, of the Barnum and Bailey circus. Griswold, in an attempt to seriously change the law, employed the help of two married women and a young married couple, all of whom needed contraception for medical reasons. She and Dr. C. Lee Buxton, Obstetrics and Gynecology Professor at Yale School of Medicine, brought the matter to the courts with the assistance of civil rights lawyers Fowler Harper and Catherine Roraback. The case involved a married couple, who underwent the aliases Paul and Pauline Poe, a young couple that had given birth to three children that had all died of medical complications shortly after their birth, as well as a woman under the alias of Jane Doe, who had experienced paralysis and speech impediment after almost dying in childbirth. Buxton, the medical expert in the case, stated to the court that the couple required contraception to prevent further physical or mental deterioration, as this issue was genetic and could potentially recur if they were to have another child. However, the state courts upheld the statute, allowing Roraback to appeal to the US Supreme Court, who accepted their case. Griswold and Buxton had intended only to change the statute so that married women could seek contraception for medical purposes. However, in a 5-4 ruling issued on June 20, 1961, the Court upheld the Connecticut statute, declaring that the law had never been enforced and the consequence of its violation was not harmful and so was constitutional. Very shortly before the decision was made, a Connecticut man was arrested and fined for providing condoms to gas stations, hoping that workers would sell them to customers. There were reported multiple cases in which people called the police regarding the incident. The man accused, however did not face any serious punishment, which may have affected the Court's decision. Hearing this, Griswold and Buxton were angered by the Court's ruling and, with the understanding that the law had never been significantly challenged, decided to test it. Griswold v. Connecticut Griswold located a small building in which to open the clinic near to the Planned Parenthood offices at 79 Trumbull Street. The PPLC had saved $60 in the event that they should open a clinic, be it after contraception was legalized or as an experiment to test the law. They found several qualified and safe doctors willing to advise women and provide the proper medical care. The clinic opened in early November, 1961 and almost immediately was this met with controversy, largely due to protesters such as James Morris, who picketed outside of the clinic with the message that what Griswold and Buxton were doing was immoral. Within days, detectives arrived to inspect the practice. Griswold allowed them to inspect and clearly informed them of the functions of the clinic. She was enthusiastic in her descriptions and provided specific and detailed information that she assumed would be used in the trial. She informed the detectives as they were leaving the clinic that she was fine with being arrested, but refused to be fingerprinted or photographed. Two days later, the detectives returned to the clinic demanding names of at least two patients that had been treated since the clinic's opening. Griswold chose a 33-year-old Yale Divinity School Graduate and a graduate student in the Yale School of Public Health, who was an English citizen and married to a colleague of Fowler Harper. Both provided their names and details of the assistance they were given at the clinic and signed formal statements. Though they had not specifically intended to get arrested to achieve their goals, Griswold and Buxton had no fear of doing so as they understood that it would help their cause. The clinic was shut down on November 9, 1961 after the witnesses had given their statements and Griswold and Buxton were charged with minor accounts pertaining to their distribution of birth control and were each fined $100. As per Griswold‚Äôs demand, neither she nor Buxton were fingerprinted or photographed. Immediately, their lawyers began their defense, now able to argue that the law would be enforced, providing a stronger and more persuasive argument. This time, Griswold decided not to employ aliases during the trial, making it widely known as the Buxton case in local Connecticut courts and Griswold v. Connecticut when the appeal made it to the Supreme Court. The lead litigator on this case was Catherine Roraback, with assistance from Thomas Emerson, who took over Fowler Harper's position after his death in 1963. 1963 was a year of significant internal tensions within Planned Parenthood and was had much to do with Griswold's actions and motivations for finding a new Planned Parenthood headquarters. A new building had been purchased at 406 Orange Street with a carriage house at the back of the property. Due to her husband's emphysema, she proposed that the two use the carriage house as their private residence to ease her husband's difficulties regarding climbing stairs. Many Planned Parenthood members were angered by this proposition, especially because of the financial crisis faced by the organization. After many arguments and much resentment throughout this time period, Griswold made the decision to resign as Executive Director. However, because of the urgency of the forthcoming Supreme Court trial, as well as the general progress Griswold had made to advance Planned Parenthood since first taking the job, she eventually persuaded to remain in her position. The Supreme Court trial began in 1965. As with Poe v. Ullman, Griswold continued argue that the anti-contraception law was a clear violation to the privacy of married couples, making it unconstitutional and dangerous. The decision in this case changed on the basis that the argument in Poe had become invalid. The law had been challenged and punishment had been enforced based on Griswold's crime. Regarding the evidence and constitutional background of the right to privacy, the Court voted 7-2 in favor of Griswold on June 7, 1965. The law was declared unconstitutional and married couples could now obtain birth control. Later life Shortly after the Supreme Court decision was made, Griswold resigned as Executive Director of Planned Parenthood. It is stated that within the organization was much tension between colleagues that she wanted to avoid. She remained in New Haven, even after Richard Griswold died of emphysema on October 1, 1966. Griswold died in Fort Myers, Florida on August 13, 1981 at the age of 81. She is buried in the cemetery of the Congregational Church in Wethersfield, Connecticut next to her husband. Griswold was inducted in the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1994. See also *Catherine Roraback *Griswold v. Connecticut *Planned Parenthood *Poe v.

The methods used have been designed for weight saving, simplicity of operation and reliability. Early piston engines were started by hand, with geared hand starting, electrical and cartridge-operated systems for larger engines being developed between the wars. Gas turbine aircraft engines such as turbojets, turboshafts and turbofans often use air/pneumatic starting, with the use of bleed air from built-in auxiliary power units (APUs) or external air compressors now seen as a common starting method. Often only one engine needs be started using the APU (or remote compressor). After the first engine is started using APU bleed air, cross-bleed air from the running engine can be used to start the remaining engine(s). Piston engines =Hand starting/propeller swinging= A 1918 sketch of ground crew receiving instruction on hand starting Hand starting of aircraft piston engines by swinging the propeller is the oldest and simplest method, the absence of any onboard starting system giving an appreciable weight saving. Positioning of the propeller relative to the crankshaft is arranged such that the engine pistons pass through top dead centre during the swinging stroke. As the ignition system is normally arranged to produce sparks before top dead centre there is a risk of the engine kicking back during hand starting, to avoid this problem one of the two magnetos used in a typical aero engine ignition system is fitted with an 'impulse coupling', this spring- loaded device delays the spark until top dead centre and also increases the rotational speed of the magneto to produce a stronger spark. When the engine fires, the impulse coupling no longer operates and the second magneto is switched on.Thom 1988, p. 166. As aero engines grew bigger in capacity (during the interwar period), single-person propeller swinging became physically difficult, ground crew personnel would join hands and pull together as a team or use a canvas sock fitted over one propeller blade, the sock having a length of rope attached to the propeller tip end.Lumsden 2003, p. 40.Gunston 2006, p. 86. Note that this is different from the manual \\"turning over\\" of radial piston engine, which is done to release oil that has become trapped in the lower cylinders prior to starting, to avoid engine damage. The two appear similar, but while hand starting involves a sharp, strong \\"yank\\" on the prop to start the engine, turning over is simply done by turning the prop through a certain set amount. Accidents have occurred during lone pilot hand starting, high throttle settings, brakes not applied or wheel chocks not being used, all resulting in aircraft moving off without the pilot at the controls.Thom 1988, p. 202. \\"Turning the engine\\" with the ignition and switches accidentally left \\"on\\" can also cause injury, as the engine can start unexpectedly when a spark plug fires. If the switch is not in start position, the spark will occur before the piston hits top dead center, which can force the propeller to violently kick back. =Hucks starter= The Shuttleworth Collection's working Hucks Starter positioned with their Bristol F.2 Fighter The Hucks starter (invented by Bentfield Hucks during WWI) is a mechanical replacement for the ground crew. Based on a vehicle chassis the device uses a clutch driven shaft to turn the propeller, disengaging as the engine starts. A Hucks starter is used regularly at the Shuttleworth Collection for starting period aircraft. =Pull cord= Self-sustaining motor gliders (often known as 'turbos') are fitted with small two-stroke engines with no starting system, for ground testing a cord is wrapped around the propeller boss and pulled rapidly in conjunction with operating decompressor valves. These engines are started in flight by operating the decompressor and increasing airspeed to windmill the propeller. Early variants of the Slingsby Falke motor glider use a cockpit mounted pull start system.Hardy 1982, p. 174. =Electric starter= A Supermarine Spitfire at readiness with a trolley accumulator connected Aircraft began to be equipped with electrical systems around 1930, powered by a battery and small wind-driven generator. The systems were initially not powerful enough to drive starter motors. Introduction of engine-driven generators solved the problem.Gunston 2006, p. 87. Introduction of electric starter motors for aero engines increased convenience at the expense of extra weight and complexity. They were a necessity for flying boats with high mounted, inaccessible engines. Powered by an onboard battery, ground electrical supply or both, the starter is operated by a key or switch in the cockpit. The key system usually facilitates switching of the magnetos.Thom 1988, p. 167. In cold ambient conditions the friction caused by viscous engine oil causes a high load on the starting system. Another problem is the reluctance of the fuel to vaporise and combust at low temperatures. Oil dilution systems were developed (mixing fuel with the engine oil),Gunston 2006, p. 89. and engine pre-heaters were used (including lighting fires under the engine). The Ki-Gass priming pump system was used to assist starting of British engines.Gunston 2006, p. 85. Aircraft fitted with variable-pitch propellers or constant speed propellers are started in fine pitch to reduce air loads and current in the starter motor circuit. Many light aircraft are fitted with a 'starter engaged' warning light in the cockpit, a mandatory airworthiness requirement to guard against the risk of the starter motor failing to disengage from the engine.Thom 1988, p. 165. =Coffman starter= The Coffman starter was an explosive cartridge operated device, the burning gases either operating directly in the cylinders to rotate the engine or operating through a geared drive. First introduced on the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engine in 1936 the Coffman starter was not widely used by civil operators due to the expense of the cartridges.Gunston 2006, pp. 87‚Äì88. =Pneumatic starter= In 1920 Roy Fedden designed a piston engine gas starting system, this was in use on the Bristol Jupiter engine by 1922. A system used in early Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines ducted high-pressure air from a ground unit through a camshaft driven distributor to the cylinders via non- return valves, the system had disadvantages which were overcome by conversion to electric starting.Rubbra 1990, p. 40. =In-flight starting= When a piston engine needs to be started in flight the electric starter motor can be used. This is normal procedure for motor gliders that have been soaring with the engine turned off. During aerobatics with earlier aircraft types it was not uncommon for the engine to cut during manoeuvres due to carburettor design. With no electric starter installed, engines can be restarted by diving the aircraft to increase airspeed and the rotation speed of the 'windmilling' propeller.Williams 1975, p. 59. =Inertia starter= An aero engine inertia starter uses a pre-rotated flywheel to transfer kinetic energy to the crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over- torque conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.FAA 1976, p. 263. Gas turbine engines Starting of a gas turbine engine requires rotation of the compressor to a speed that provides sufficient pressurised air to the combustion chambers. The starting system has to overcome inertia of the compressor and friction loads, the system remains in operation after combustion starts and is disengaged once the engine has reached self-idling speed.FAA 1976, p. 270.Stewart 1986, p. 33. =Electric starter= Two types of electrical starter motor can be used, direct-cranking (to disengage as internal combustion engines) and starter-generator system (permanently engaged).FAA 1976, pp. 271‚Äì272. =Hydraulic starter= Small gas turbine engines, particularly turboshaft engines used in helicopters and cruise missile turbojets can be started by a geared hydraulic motor using oil pressure from a ground supply.Gunston 1997, p. 82. =Air-start= Cutaway view of an air-start motor of a General Electric J79 turbojet With air-start systems gas turbine engine compressor spools are rotated by the action of a large volume of compressed air acting directly on the compressor blades or driving the engine through a small, geared turbine motor. These motors can weigh up to 75% less than an equivalent electrical system. The compressed air can be supplied from an on-board auxiliary power unit (APU), a portable gas generator used by ground crew or by cross feeding bleed air from a running engine in the case of multi-engined aircraft.FAA 1976, p. 277. The Turbomeca Palouste gas generator was used to start the Spey engines of the Blackburn Buccaneer. The de Havilland Sea Vixen was equipped with its own Palouste in a removable underwing container to facilitate starting when away from base.Flightglobal archive - Flight, March 1965 Retrieved: 15 August 2012 Other military aircraft types using ground supplied compressed air for starting include the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and variants of the F-4 Phantom using the General Electric J79 turbojet engine. =Combustion starters= AVPIN starter Versions of the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine used a geared turbine starter motor that burned isopropyl nitrate as the fuel. In military service this monofuel had the NATO designation of S-746 AVPIN. For starting a measured amount of fuel was introduced to the starter combustion chamber then ignited electrically, the hot gases spinning the turbine at high revolutions with the exhaust exiting overboard.Gunston 1997, p. 81. Cartridge starter Mass cartridge start of Hawker Sea Hawk aircraft Similar in operating principle to the piston engine Coffman starter, an explosive cartridge drives a small turbine engine which is connected by gears to the compressor shaft.FAA 1976, p. 281. Fuel/air turbine starter (APU) Developed for short-haul airliners, most civil and military aircraft requiring self-contained starting systems these units are known by various names including Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Jet Fuel Starter (JFS), Air Start Unit (ASU) or Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC). Comprising a small gas turbine which is electrically started, these devices provide compressed bleed air for engine starting and often also provide electrical and hydraulic power for ground operations without the need to run the main engines.FAA 1976, p. 283. ASUs are used today within the civil and military Ground Support to serve Aircraft on main engine start (MES) and pneumatic bleed-air-support for the Environmental Control System (ECS) cooling and heating Internal combustion engine starter Riedel two-stroke starter motor of the Junkers Jumo 004 An interesting feature of all three German jet engine designs that saw production of any kind before May 1945: the German BMW 003, Junkers Jumo 004 and Heinkel HeS 011 axial-flow turbojet engine designs was the starter system, which consisted of a Riedel 10 hp (7.5 kW) flat twin two-stroke air-cooled engine hidden in the intake, and essentially functioned as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit (APU) for starting a jet engine ‚Äî for the Jumo 004, a hole in the extreme nose of the intake diverter contained a D-shaped manual pull-handle which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two small petrol/oil mix tanks were fitted in the annular intake.Gunston 1997, p. 141. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird used two Buick Nailheads as a starter motors, which were mounted on a trolley. Later big block chevy engines were used. =In-flight restart= Gas turbine engines can be shut down in flight, intentionally by the crew to save fuel or during a flight test or unintentionally due to fuel starvation or flameout after a compressor stall. Sufficient airspeed is used to 'windmill' the compressor then fuel and ignition are switched on, an on-board auxiliary power unit may be used at high altitudes where the air density is lower. During zoom climb operations of the Lockheed NF-104A the jet engine was shut down on climbing through and was started using the windmill method on descent through denser air.Bowman 2000, p. 173. Pulse jet starting London Science Museum Pulse jet engines are uncommon aircraft powerplants. However, the Argus As 014 used to power the V-1 flying bomb and Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg was a notable exception. In this pulse jet three air nozzles in the front section were connected to an external high-pressure air source, butane from an external supply was used for starting, ignition was accomplished by a spark plug located behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit.Jane's 1998, p. 284. Once the engine started and the temperature rose to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed, and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 40 to 45 times per second. The electrical ignition system was used only to start the engine; heating of the tailpipe skin maintained combustion. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Bowman, Martin W. Lockheed F-104 Starfighter.

Biography Her first solo exhibition was held at the Galerie du Haut Pav√© in Paris in 1993, curated by Jean Pierre Brice Olivier. Her work has been exhibited around the world and she is held in many collections both public and private. Her multidisciplinary artistic work spans painting, collage, sculpture, photography and artists‚Äô books. She grew up in France and most of her work is still produced in Paris where she has her studio. After literary studies, she worked in a number of professions before starting painting full-time in 1988. She is a figure of the new scene in Abstract Art and is known for the unique technique in painting as well as for her Artist's books. Her work has been exhibited at the Industry Museum (now renamed \\"Bois du Cazier\\") of Charleroi in Belgium; the Nagoya Museum; the Toyama Museum; the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art and the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art in Japan; the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taiwan; the Mus√©e des Avelines, Saint Cloud, France; the Swedish American Museum in Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, Maracaibo, Venezuela; the Sofia Imber Contemporary Art Museum, Caracas, Venezuela; the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Sejong Center in Seoul, Korea; the Collage Museum, Mexico; the Mus√©e Barrois in Bar-Le-Duc, France; the Argonne Museum in Varennes, France; the O Art Museum, in Tokyo, Japan; the Art and Historical Museum of Montbeliard, France; the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art, Tarpon Springs, Florida; the Austin Museum of Art, Austin, Texas. Her work was exhibited at the FSU Museum of Fine Arts, Tallahassee, Florida in 2011 and 2012. In her new works Patricia Erbelding continues to place keen attention on the concepts of transformation and metamorphosis, their application to organic and inorganic materials, and the meaning behind and produced by the process of inscribing such materials herself. Metaphors of time passing and evolution are also at play in her photographic work. Erbelding is currently represented by Jacques Levy Gallery, Paris; Galerie Insula, Paris and Port-Joinville in √éle d'Yeu; Art Forum Gallery, Antwerp, Belgium ; Dhalgren Gallery, Paris; Envie D'Art, London; Le Cabinet Amateur Gallery, Paris and Eva Doublet Gallery, St Georges du Bois. Background Erbelding was raised in the suburbs of Paris and studied literature at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle. Through her family she nevertheless inherited an artistic tradition ‚Äì her father sculpted and her uncle painted. In 1983 she started working in an engraving studio on printmaking. While she perfected the techniques of intaglio and etching she also started working in painting and clay. Her early works included painted photography and collages and at the same early period she also produced her first Artist's books. After a few years, Erbelding refined what have been a trademark technique involving Iron oxidations and beeswax. Techniques and processes Erbelding apply an oxidation process which acts almost as an etching of the paper-coated canvas ‚Äì the characteristic lines that forms are practically burnt into the media through the oxidation process. There is a clear link with her earlier works in etching. A slow and rigorous production process is a distinguishing feature. For her works, she uses acrylic and oil paint, paper, beeswax and iron oxide. Photography appeared in her work in 1995 and was also important in her creation of artists books. Her artist's books are realized as collaborations with writers and poets such as Jo√´l Bastard, Michel Bohbot, Michel Butor, Serge Gavronsky, Hubert Lucot, Tita Reut and more. She has also produced cover art and illustrations for books, notably for Christina Mengert at Burning Deck Press. Career =Early years= Her first solo exhibition at the Haut Pave Gallery which was well received was followed by a number of other gallery shows in Paris and other cities. Works from this period was often noted for its likeness to epidermis with the oxidation traces as scar tissue. Erbelding was elected to be Artist in Residence in 1995 at the Ponts De Sambre Art Center in Charleroi in Belgium. Next year in 1996, she received a grant from the Wallonie Center in Paris and the French Embassy in Belgium and developed a series of forged iron sculptures produced in the Industry Museum of Charleroi. She also invited the artist Tony Souli√© to work there and in 1997 their sculptures were exhibited at the Museum together with paintings and photographs. Her 1998 artist's book ‚ÄúGestes‚Äù, a collaboration with the poet Pierre Marc Levergeois was included in the collection of the New York MOMA Library. =Later years= Today, Erbelding has established her studio in the 19th arrondissement of Paris where in 2003 she took part in a street art event organized by Christine Phal. 2003 also saw the kick-off for the world-travelling exhibition ‚Äú8th international shoebox sculpture exhibition‚Äù initiated by the University of Hawai Art Gallery that were to visit 16 different museums and art centers over two years. She has regular solo exhibitions at the Jacques Levy Gallery in Paris since 2003, beginning with ‚ÄúVues des anges‚Äù, an exhibition based on a poem of Rainer Maria Rilke. Will follow ‚ÄúCinabre‚Äù in 2005, ‚ÄúInterstate‚Äù(photographic work) in 2006, ‚ÄúNoir‚Äù in 2007, ‚ÄúUrban Legend‚Äù in 2009 and recently in 2011 with ‚ÄúLost Paradise‚Äù where she refers to Milton's poem ‚ÄúParadise Lost‚Äù in a game of white and light blue paintings where the blue sphere of melancholia imposes its presence. A first monograph of her work ‚ÄúL‚ÄôEtat des m√©tamorphoses‚Äú was published in 2005 by Art Inprogress with text and poems by Tita Reut, translated by Keith Waldrop and in 2007, she was selected into the 14th International Art Exhibition at the National Art Center in Tokyo. 2008 saw her photographic work in the ‚ÄúY‚Äôa pas photo‚Äù exhibition at the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques (MABA) in Nogent sur Marne. In 2009 was held at the Espace Saint Louis Art Center, in collaboration with the Barrois Museum, M√©diath√®que and Theatre in Bar-le-Duc, France, her solo exhibition : ‚ÄúLa peinture √† livre ouvert‚Äù. Large scale paintings and artists books were presented. The subject matter was the link between painting and writing. She was featured in a number of collective shows throughout 2010, among others: with the Denjoy collection at the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art in Tarpon Springs, Florida and Artita-2010 in Piran, Slovenia. She also collaborated on a number of Artist's Books including an edition of ‚ÄúCarcasses‚Äù with Eric Coisel and Michel Butor and ‚ÄúThe Ghost Lemur of William S. Burroughs‚Äù with Tony Souli√©. 2011 saw Erbelding featured at the 26th Annual Tallahassee International at the FSU Museum of Fine Art as well as in the International Art Fair (SETEC) in Seoul. A book on her works ‚ÄúH2O‚Äú, by Corine Girieud was also published. In 2012, she received an award for the 2012 Professional Women Photographers exhibition in New York, juried by Mary Ellen Mark and had a major exhibition during the summer at the Eva Doublet Gallery. Curated by Lucette Bielle, the Mus√©e du Vin of Paris hosted an exhibition of Erbelding's works in 2013 This followed the collaboration between Erbelding and the Domaine de Viaud Vineyard in Pomerol, managed by Bielle, where one of her paintings is used for the label on the 2007 vintage. At the 2014 opening of The Peninsula Paris hotel, Erbelding's artworks are found in every room of the building. The Artists‚Äô book in collaboration with the writer R√©gine Detambel ‚ÄúElle est le Monde‚Äù, is part of the ‚ÄúMagic Unicorns‚Äù reopening of the Mus√©e de Cluny in 2018. Also in 2018, takes place ‚ÄúSignes Sensibles‚Äù, at the Ch√¢teau du Val Fleury in Gif-sur-Yvette bringing together Erbelding with Coskun, Michel Haas and Claude Viallat in an exhibition curated by Laurence d‚ÄôIst, exploring the echoes of prehistoric cave painting through contemporary art. Most recently, Erbelding's work on murmurations was featured by the Grande Chartreuse Museum.

It is considered a forced merger.‚ÄûBei einer generellen Beurteilung ist ¬ªZwangsvereinigung¬´ der richtige Begriff. Er macht klar, dass es f√ºr die Sozialdemokraten in der SBZ damals keine Alternative gab.

Deutsche Geschichte vom ‚ÄûDritten Reich‚Äú bis zur Wiedervereinigung, C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen, 4. Aufl. 2002, S. 125). In the course of the merger, about 5,000 Social Democrats who opposed it were detained and sent to camps and jails.Halb faule L√∂sung: Die gro√üe Koalition verbessert nach heftiger Kritik die Opferpensionen f√ºr Verfolgte des DDR-Regimes. Focus 24/2007, S. 51. Although nominally a merger of equals, the merged party quickly fell under Communist domination. The SED became the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1949; by then, it had become a full- fledged Communist Party‚Äìfor all intents and purposes, the KPD under a new name. It developed along lines similar to other Communist Parties in what became the Soviet Bloc. The SED would be the only ruling party of the GDR until its dissolution after the Peaceful Revolution in December 1989. Background Among circles of the workers' parties KPD and SPD there were different interpretations of the reasons for the rise of the Nazis and their electoral success. A portion of the Social Democrats blamed the devastating role of Communists in the final phase of the Weimar Republic.Hermann Weber: Kommunistische Bewegung und realsozalistischer Staat. Beitr√§ge zum deutschen und internationalen Kommunismus, hrsg. von Werner M√ºller. Bund-Verlag, K√∂ln 1988, S. 168. The Communist Party, in turn, insulted the Social Democrats as \\"social fascists\\" (\\"Sozialfaschisten\\"). Others believed that the splitting of the labour movement into the SPD and KPD prevented them effectively opposing the power of the Nazis, made possible by the First World War. In 1945 there were calls in both the SPD and KPD for a united workers' party. The Soviet Military Administration in Germany initially opposed the idea because they took it for granted that the Communist Party would, under their guidance, develop into the strongest political force in the Soviet occupation zone. However, the outcomes of the elections conducted in Hungary and Austria in November 1945, and especially the poor performance of the Communist parties, demonstrated the urgent need for a change of strategy by the Communist party.Andreas Malycha/Peter Jochen Winters: Die SED. Geschichte einer deutschen Partei. C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2009. , S. 28. Both Stalin and Walter Ulbricht recognized the \\"Austria hazard\\" (‚ÄûGefahr √ñsterreich‚Äú)Wortlaut Walter Ulbrichts siehe Mike Schmeitzner, Sowjetisierung oder Neutralit√§t?

Preparation for the Merger Under heavy pressure from the Soviet occupation forces and the Communist Party leadership, and with the support of some leading Social Democrats, working groups and committees were formed at all levels of the parties, whose declared aim was to create a union between the two parties. Many Social Democrats unwilling to unite were arrested in early 1946 in all areas of the Soviet occupation zone.‚ÄûDie nunmehr frei zug√§nglichen zeitgen√∂ssischen Dokumente √ºber die von √∂rtlichen sowjetischen Kommandanturen gema√üregelten und inhaftierten Sozialdemokraten geben Aufschluss dar√ºber, wie vielerorts erst psychischer Druck der Besatzungsoffiziere die Vereinigung m√∂glich machte.‚Äú Andreas Malycha, Der ewige Streit um die Zwangsvereinigung, Berliner Republik 2/2006 (online). On 1 March 1946, a chaotic conference of SPD party officials, convened on the initiative of the Communist and SPD leaderships, was held in the Admiralspalast, Berlin. The meeting voted to arrange a vote of SPD party members, both in the Soviet occupation zone and across Berlin, on the proposed merger with the Communist Party.‚ÄûIn der Versammlung sozialdemokratischer Funktion√§re vom 1.

On March 14, 1946 the Central Committee of the SPD published a call for a merger of the SPD and KPD.Berliner SPD, Archiv A ballot was scheduled to take place of SPD members in Berlin on 31 March 1946. In the Soviet sector (subsequently known as East Berlin) Soviet soldiers sealed the ballot boxes less than thirty minutes after the polls had opened, and dispersed the queues of those waiting to vote. In West Berlin more than 70% of the SPD members took part in the vote. In the western sector, invited to vote on an immediate merger (\\"sofortige Verschmelzung\\") with the Communists, 82% of those voting rejected the proposal. However, on a second proposal for a \\"working alliance\\" (\\"Aktionsb√ºndnis\\") with the Communists, 62% of those voting did so in support of the motion.Dietrich Staritz, Die Gr√ºndung der DDR. 2. Aufl. 1987, , S. 123. Party unification day An early logo that depicts KPD-SPD unity in 1946. On 7 April 1946 a group of SPD opponents of the merger in the western sector of Berlin met together in a school in Zehlendorf (Berlin) for a new party conference at which they elected a three-man leadership team comprising Karl Germer jr., Franz Neumann and Curt Swolinzky. On the same date a decision in support of the merger was taken at a joint Party Conference of regional delegates from the two parties inside the Soviet occupation zone. On 19/20 October in Berlin the 15th party conference of the German Communists and the 40th party conference of the German Social Democrats decided in favour of the establishment of the merged SED (party). The handshake at the centre of the SED party flag was introduced to symbolize the hand shake of the two party chairmen, Wilhelm Pieck (KPD) and Otto Grotewohl (SPD) at the congress that determined the creation in 1946 of East Germany's new united party of the left (SED). On 21/22 April 1946 another meeting took place in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin at the Admiralspalast. This was the Unification congress, and it was attended by delegates from the SPD and KPD for the entire Soviet Occupation Zone, which by now was in the process of developing into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). On 22 April 1946 the unification of the (East German) SPD and KPD was completed, to form the SED. There were over 1,000 party members in attendance of whom 47% came from the KPD and 53% from the SPD. 230 of the delegates actually came from the western occupation zones. However, 103 SPD delegates from the western zones had no democratic mandate to support merger, because of the meeting in the western sector of Berlin at Zehlendorf earlier in the month, at which delegates had backed rejection of any unification between the two political parties.Martin Broszat, Gerhard Braas, Hermann Weber: SBZ-Handbuch, M√ºnchen 1993, . The congress decided unanimously in favour of uniting the parties. The new party would include equal representation by two representatives, one from each of the component parties at every level. The party Chairmen were Wilhelm Pieck (KPD) and Otto Grotewohl (SPD), their deputies Walter Ulbricht (KPD) and Max Fechner (SPD). The handshake of the two party chairmen was embodied in the central element of the new party's logo. Following this special congress individual members of the KPD and SPD would be able to transfer their membership to the new SED with a simple signature. Although parity of power and position between members of the two former parties continued to be applied extensively for a couple of years, by 1949 SPD people were virtually excluded. Between 1948 and 1951 \\"equal representation\\" was abandoned, as former SPD members were forced out of their jobs, denounced as \\"Agents of Schumacher\\",Kurt Schmacher was the leader of the SPD (party) in West Germany, which was by now the name being given to that part of Germany not subject to Soviet military administration. subjected to defamation, regular purges and at times imprisonment, so that they were frightened into silence. Influential party positions in the new ruling party were being given almost exclusively to former members of the KPD. Berlin, the special case The four occupation zones in Berlin as established in 1945 The rules agreed between the occupying powers concerning Berlin itself conferred on the city a special status which differentiated the Soviet sector of Berlin from the Soviet occupation zone of Germany which on three of its four sides adjoined it. The SPD used this fact to run a party referendum on the merger, using a secret ballot, across the whole of Berlin. The referendum was suppressed in the Soviet sector on 31 March 1946, but it went ahead in those parts of the city controlled by the other three occupying powers, and resulted in rejection of the merger proposal from 82% of the votes cast by participating SPD members. The merger of the KPD and SPD to form the SED only affected the Soviet sector of the city. It was not till the end of May 1946 that the four Allies reached agreement: the western allies permitted the SED in the western sectors, and in return the Soviet Military Administration in Germany agreed to allow the SPD back into the eastern sector of Berlin.Beschluss vom 31. Mai 1946 der Alliierten Stadtkommandantur: In allen vier Sektoren der ehemaligen Reichshauptstadt werden die Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands und die neugegr√ºndete Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands zugelassen. That did not mean, however, that the SPD was able to operate unhindered as a political party in East Berlin.Anjana Buckow, Zwischen Propaganda und Realpolitik: Die USA und der sowjetisch besetzte Teil Deutschlands 1945‚Äì1955, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2003, , page 196 Following the City council elections for Greater Berlin which took place on 20 October 1946,Der Landeswahlleiter in Berlin: Wahlergebnisse zur Stadtverordnetenversammlung 1946 in which the SED and SPD both competed, the total turn-out was high at 92.3%. Across the city, the SPD won 48.7% of the vote while the SED won 19.8%. Of the other principal participants the CDU (party) won 22.2% and the LDP 9.3%. As matters turned out, this was the only free election to take place across the entirety of Berlin until after 1990. Following the 1946 city council election the Soviet Military Administration and the SED in effect divided the city. In 1947 the Soviet city commander vetoed from the election of Ernst Reuter as the city's governing mayor. This was followed up by the blowing up of the City Council Building by \\"the masses\\" and the withdrawal of the Soviet city commander from the Allied Kommandatura in 1948, which turned out to be a prelude to the Soviet Union's Blockade of West Berlin.Gerhard Kunze: Grenzerfahrungen: Kontakte und Verhandlungen zwischen dem Land Berlin und der DDR 1949‚Äì1989, Akademie Verlag, 1999, page 16.Eckart Thurich: Die Deutschen und die Sieger, in: Informationen zur politischen Bildung, Vol 232, published by the Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung, Bonn 1991. The SPD did indeed continue to exist in the eastern sector, but the basis for its existence changed fundamentally, since it was banned from public activity and its participation in elections was blocked by the National Front of the Democratic Republic of Germany, a political alliance created to enable minor political parties to be controlled by the SED. Some individual SPD members nevertheless continued to be politically active. Most notably, Kurt Neubauer, the regional SPD chairman in Berlin-Friedrichshain was elected to the West German Bundestag where he sat from 1 February 1952 till 16 April 1963, for much of the time as the only member of the chamber with a home address inside the Soviet occupation zone. It was only in August 1961, a few days after the Berlin Wall was erected, that the party closed his office in East Berlin,Neubauer himself, with his family, was in West Berlin when the wall was suddenly put in place, and it would be many years before they were permitted to set foot in East Berlin again. but without giving up its claim to it. Over the wall, prior to reunification in 1990, the SED played only a marginal role, even after in 1962 changing its name, for local purposes, to \\"Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin\\" (SEW / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Westberlins). Even in the aftermath of the 1968 \\"events\\" any party influence in the west proved ephemeral. The example of Thuringia In contrast to Berlin, for which voting results show SPD majorities rejecting the merger of the left-wing parties, the historian Steffen Kachel has identified quite a different set of results in Thurinigia, a region dominated by farms and forests, where for most of the time left-wing parties had hitherto enjoyed a lower level of overall support among the population as a whole than, typically, applied in western Europe's big industrial cities. In Berlin and nationally the SPD had already experienced lengthy periods in government during the Weimar years. Especially in Berlin city politics, the KPD had conducted an active and largely constructive role in opposition before 1933. Rivalry between SPD and KPD in Berlin was deeply rooted. In Thuringia the relationship between the two parties had been far more collaborative. There had even in 1923, and briefly, been a period of coalition between them in the regional government during the economic crisis of that time. After 1933 the collaborative relationship between the SPD and the KPD in rural Thuringia had been sustained during the twelve Nazi years (when both parties had been banned by the government) and surfaced again in 1945 until broken by the Stalinist approach presented by the creation of the SED.Ein rot-roter Sonderweg? Sozialdemokraten und Kommunisten in Th√ºringen 1919 bis 1949 (= Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission f√ºr Th√ºringen. Kleine Reihe, Vol 29), B√∂hlau, K√∂ln/Weimar/Wien 2011, . See also Steffen Kachel: Entscheidung f√ºr die SED 1946 ‚Äì ein Verrat an sozialdemokratischen Idealen?, in Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, Vol I/2004. Party memberships at the time of the merger In the Soviet occupation zone (excluding Greater Berlin) party membership numbers were as follows: :* KPD: .....624,000 members (April 1946) :* SPD: .....695,000 members (31 March 1946) :* SED: ..1,297,600 members (April 1946) The fact that the post-merger membership total of the merged of the SED was more than 20,000 below the combined pre-merger total memberships of the two predecessor parties reflects the fact that several thousand SPD members did not instantly rush to sign their party transfer forms. Among comrades from the SPD side, rejection of the merger was at its strongest in Greater Berlin, and it was here that the largest proportion of party members did not become members of the new merged party: :* KPD, Berlin: 75,000 members (April 1946) :* SPD, Berlin: 50,000 members (31 March 1946) :* SED, Berlin: 99,000 members (April 1946) During the two years following the party merger, overall membership of the SED increased significantly, from 1,297,600 to approximately 2,000,000 across East Germany by the summer of 1948, possibly swollen by prisoners of war returning from the Soviet Union or former SPD members who had initially rejected the merger having had a change of heart. Consequences and follow-through SPD members who had opposed the merger were prevented from refounding an independent Social Democratic party in the Soviet occupation zone by the Soviet administration. Six months after the KPD/SPD merger, in the regional elections of October 1946 the new unified workers' party did not attract as many votes as they had anticipated: despite massive support from the occupation authorities, the SED failed to gain an overall majority in any of the regional legislatures. In Mecklenburg and Thuringia their vote fell only slightly short of the required 50%, but in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, the \\"Bourgeois\\" CDU and LDP gained sufficient electoral support to form governing coalitions.Martin Broszat, Hermann Weber, SBZ-Handbuch: Staatliche Verwaltungen, Parteien, gesellschaftliche Organisationen und ihre F√ºhrungskr√§fte in der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone Deutschlands 1945‚Äì1949, Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 1993, , page 418. Even more disappointing for the new SED (party) was the electoral outcome in Greater Berlin, where the SED won only 19.8% of the vote, notwithstanding the best efforts of the authorities. Elections in East Germany applied the \\"single list\\" approach. Voters were presented with a single list from the National Front of Democratic Germany, which in turn was controlled by the SED. Only one candidate appeared on the ballot. Voters simply took the ballot paper and dropped it into the ballot box. Those who wanted to vote against the candidate had to go to a separate voting booth, without any secrecy. Seats were apportioned based on a set quota, not according to actual vote totals.Eugene Register-Guard October 29, 1989. p. 5A. By ensuring that its candidates dominated the list, the SED effectively predetermined the composition of the National legislature (Volkskammer). The upside of East Germany's new voting system, in 1950, was apparent from the reported 99.6% level of support for the SED based on a turn- out of 98.5%.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p779 After 1946 SPD members who had spoken up in opposition to the party merger were required to surrender their offices. Many faced political persecution and some fled. Some persisted in their political beliefs with the Eastern Bureau of the SPD which retained an office in East Berlin until 1981 (in theory) and continued the political work of the party leaders and members who had fled the country. It was not until October 1989 that a Social Democratic Party was again established in the German Democratic Republic. The SPD then participated in the country's first (and as matters turned out last) free election in March 1990, winning 21.9% of the overall vote. Later in the year, in October 1990, East Germany's SPD merged with the West German SPD, in a development which mirrored the reunification of Germany itself. The SPD in western Germany and the Forced Merger The view that in 1933 long-standing political divisions on the German left had opened a path for the Nazi takeover was not restricted to the Soviet occupation zone. During 1945 there was also discussion about the relationship between the SPD and the Communist Party in the western occupation zones. In some localities (for instance Hamburg, nearby Elmshorn,In Elmshorn the British Military Administration vetoed a merger of the parties locally. Munich, Brunswick and Wiesbaden) joint working groups between the two parties were set up to look at options for closer collaboration or merger.

In June 2012, the story arc was reprinted in the 24th compilation of the comic strip series, named PB24. For the first time in the series, Cristina \\"Tiny\\" Sungcal and her gay friend Pao Tang appear as main characters. Synopsis One day, Tiny seeks Mang Dagul's help in a field trip to the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) in Mandaluyong as part of a school field trip. Bab drops her off instead. After the trip, Tiny tells her experiences to Pao in a series of flashbacks that break the fourth wall. In the asylum, Tiny interviews a deranged patient named Dr Arnibal Necter, who calls her Agent CS of the Fat Bitch Ingenue (FBI) agency. Over the course of the interview, Dr Necter makes a series of cryptic predictions. Tiny and Pao connect two predictions on recent events: the sabotage of a biodiesel- producing liposuction clinic that botched an operation on US Ambassador to the Philippines Harry Thomas and the destruction of a local jatropha farm using swarms of the Pennsylvania marmorated stink bug and the California scutellarid bug - insects only found in the US. The duo's research identifies a piggery in Cavite and a hydrogen processing plant as possible targets. Tiny visits the plant and talks to the supervisor, averting an explosion that could be traced to hydrogen vapors. As Tiny calls Pao to report on the latest development, Pao himself crashes from the sky in front of her. Pao explains that she visited the piggery and met a Korean man named Mr Shin (who often emphasizes the word SHIN in a loud voice). He says the piggery's waste is processed at a co- located methane research facility for alternative fuel in passenger cars. However, the facility explodes when a door Shin opens triggers a whole set of matches attached to one door, thereby lighting the methane gas and sending the two into the air. Tiny and Pao head to an ethanol production plant in Tarlac that could be another target. A man in shades, jeans, and jacket named the \\"Tsimaymenator\\" kidnaps the plant's consultant, Ciara Connor, and escapes despite the FBI agents shooting him and his goons with special nonlethal darts. The kidnapping fumes Connor's husband, Christian Bale Connor. Reflecting on two more of Dr Necter's predictions, Tiny matches them to a purported leak of sulfuric acid from a battery plant in Sta Rosa, Laguna and a potential terrorist threat at an international bio-energy conference held in the Manila Hotel. While scoping out the security at the hotel, Tiny chances upon Ciara at the women's restroom and tries to get her out of the hotel - only to run into several bodyguards. Polgas appears to bring Ciara to safety while Tiny and Pao fight off their pursuers. Tiny turns into another alter-ego named Obesa Vanidosa and sends some agents into a long chase. Obesa rejoins Pao, and so does Mr Shin, who has finally crashed back to the ground after the plant explosion in time to squash the Tsimaymenator from killing the two. The group heads to the safehouse - a nipa hut - in San Pablo, Laguna, but Pao gets a hunch about being followed. It is proven true as their Toyota Prius and the safehouse is blown up apparently by Predator drones. Fortunately, the entire safehouse is specially armored underneath the thatching, and Obesa uses a special rod to fire explosive anti-vehicle rounds at two black Ford E-150 vans carrying the agents from the hotel. When the vans are destroyed, Ciara identifies the drone that attacked them as an Avenger, which repositions for another attack until Mr Shin flies into the air to forcibly crash it. Obesa, Pao, and Mr Shin finally mop up the remaining agents. Obesa reverts to Tiny and introduces herself to Mr Shin - who recognizes Ciara as Dr Alecx dela Cruz, a senior consultant in his methane plant. Now angered at the subterfuge, Tiny and Pao crosscheck and learn that Connor/dela Cruz is actually Dr Cristina Torres, who worked at the hydrogen plant Tiny visited earlier (also as a consultant). Tiny deduces that the consultancy job was a cover for the sabotage operations. She forces Torres to come clean and make sense of all the evidence compiled against her. Torres explains that the Tsimaymenator was actually in Tarlac to rescue her now that her cover was blown and reveals that a Detroit-based syndicate of American muscle car enthusiasts plotted the sabotage to stifle research on alternative fuels. To Tiny and Pao's surprise, she admits that Dr Necter was the group's chief saboteur, whose handiwork in tampering the Prius' brake and acceleration systems resulted in its recall. However, he went soft after refusing to participate in the murder of Gerry Ortega and returned to the US to announce his exit from the group (but not before stowing sugar in the gas tanks and carburetors of the members' cars, plus putting rotten meat in the trunks of cars upholstered with horse hide leather). Tiny returns to the NCMH and confronts Dr Necter about the revelations. He states that the beauty of Palawan made him appreciate the environment more and changed his goal to promote clean energy. As Mr Shin distracts the NCMH staff with a photo shoot, Tiny and Torres blast open Dr Necter's cell and spring him. Dr Necter and Dr Torres fly back to the US to settle their scores with the group. =Epilogue= Tiny laments that despite the best efforts of current researchers, she would never see the widespread use of sustainable energy for cars in her lifetime. She and Pao get wind of a news report about a sinkhole that apparently formed underneath a car engine factory in Detroit and presume that Dr Necter did it. Pao is stunned to see that Mr Shin - whom he desires as a sugar daddy - is actually gay. Due to more fourth wall-breaking actions (the last of which has Mr. Shin, who by then was speaking in Tagalog, reminding everyone that they are all in a comic, where everything is possible), the creator, Pol Medina Jr., then has the Tsimaymenator (referred to as Arnold, by this point it is nothing more than an endoskeleton) close the story arc with \\"Diz story iz terminated!\\" Real-life references *Tiny's alter-ego and Dr Necter is a reference to Agent Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. She states that the trip to the NCMH is required because her professor will make her entire class watch the drama series Budoy (about a mentally impaired young man). * The Tsimaymenator is a portmanteau of the Tagalog slang word tsimay (househelp) and the famous movie character Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger (true enough, his T-800 endoskeleton is revealed underneath). The Tsimaymenator even asks Ciara Connor in the same manner that the Terminator tries to identify Sarah Connor for termination. A line he utters, \\"You are sperminated!\\", and a pregnancy kit testing positive, is a throwback to the revelation in 2011 about Schwarzenegger siring a child with his own househelp. In preparing to kill Tiny and Pao with his Minigun, he accidentally utters part of Tony Montana's classic catchphrase before remembering that it was the wrong movie. His family jewels are also compared to that of Filipino lawyer Ferdinand Topacio, who gladly wagered one of his testicles to be cut off during a controversy involving former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's potential flight from justice in 2011. *Pao shoots the Tsimaymenator's goons with concentrated estrogen darts, which triggers eight minutes of homosexual behavior - in this case, the goons dance to New York, New York. They later try to tempt a police officer booking them with gossip about whether young Filipino actress Rhian Ramos had an abortion. *Connor's husband, Christian Bale Connor, is based on actor Christian Bale, who both played the role of Batman & John Connor in Terminator:Salvation. He appears in the Tumbler after she is kidnapped. *In explaining the attack by Predator drones on the safehouse, Tiny tells Dr Torres to snap out of her claims about the US deployment of the drones in the Philippines. The AFP has denied its use in the country's airspace. *In making Dr Necter's escape, Dr Torres drives a Tesla Roadster. *A single strip features Obesa Vanidosa being chased by agents. Some bystanders in the background assume the entire scene as part of the Manila shooting of the Bourne Legacy (with Tiny as an apparently obese Rachel Weisz). References Bibliography *Medina, Pol.

It was premiered in Moscow's Maly Theatre on January 25, 1854 and in Saint Petersburg's Alexandrinsky Theatre on September the 9th. History Ostrovsky started to work upon Poverty is No Vice (working title: God Thwarts the Proud One, Gordym Bog protivitsa) in the late August 1853 and finished it in just two months. On November 23, 1853, the play was publicly read at Apollon Grigoriev's and was warmly welcomed by the audience of good friends. The next reading took place at the sculptor Nikolai Ramazanov's home with a different set of guests and again was successful. For some reason the Moskvityanin chief Mikhail Pogodin was hesitating with the publication, but the play soon came out as a book and was taken up by the Maly Theatre, for actor Prov Sadovsky's benefice. Poverty is No Vice was premiered on January 25, 1854, with Prov Sadovsky playing Lyubim Tortsov, the \\"virtuous drunkard\\" and \\"a true Russian,\\" unlike, apparently, his affluent brother who was trying \\"to be an Englishman.\\" The premiere coincided with the famous French actress Rachel's shows, which had to be moved to morning hours. Such juxtaposition served to polarize even more the Moscow theatrical community as regards Ostrovsky's controversial phenomenon.

Early life and education He was born in Ramat Gan. Early Career in Israel In 2004, Segev released his first single, \\"Achsav Tov\\", which was written about his brother, an Israel Defense Forces captain who was killed during his service, and tells the story of a day the two had spent together just weeks before his passing. The song became a hit and was the most broadcast song on Israeli radio that year. The single was followed by the release of his album of the same name, which included a few other singles including \\"Writing You a Story\\", which was the theme song for the Israeli television show, Peach. In 2006, Segev released the single \\"The Love That Stays\\", which would go on to be the song featured in Israeli telecommunications company Hot's marketing campaign for that year. The song was the namesake for his second album, which was written over a long period of time during which Segev shut himself in his house, doing nothing but writing music. In 2007, Segev co-wrote the song \\"Let's Leave\\" with Ran Danker and Elai Botner, which would go on to win \\"Song of the Year\\" at the Israeli Music Channel's yearly award ceremony. After his second album, Segev took some time off in isolation yet again, this time to rediscover his Jewish, Syrian and Polish roots and incorporate them into his music. He started learning to play traditional authentic instruments from Syria and Eastern Europe to accomplish that goal, and altered his artistic focus to creating an experience for the audience to assist them to discover their own inner identities, as he had. This culminated in a new sound for Segev, which was heard on his third album, We Were Meant to Be (\\"Noadnu\\", ◊†◊ï◊¢◊ì◊†◊ï), released in 2009. (1 January 2012). Ynet: ◊í◊ú◊¢◊ì ◊©◊í◊ë: \\"◊¢◊ù ◊†◊ï◊°◊ó◊î ◊ú◊ú◊î◊ô◊ò◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ô◊î ◊§◊î ◊û◊©◊¢◊û◊ù\\" (in Hebrew). Ynet. Retrieved 20 February 2013. The album went on to be certified gold, selling over 20,000 copies. It features the song \\"Woman from the Sky\\", which went on to garner over two million hits on YouTube, and was Segev's second song to win the title of Israeli radio's most broadcast song that year. The album also included the theme song, \\"Noadnu\\", which is a cover of the Swedish electronic-music band The Knife's song \\"Marble House\\". In 2011, Segev cooperated with the band Matbucha Project in writing a cover song for Nathan Alterman's \\"Chana'leh Hitbalbelah\\", which became the fourth-most-played song on Israeli radio in 2011. In early 2012, Segev released Holy Day (◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊©), which would break the record for most plays in a week on Israeli radio. The song was the first single from Segev's fourth album released in March 2012, \\"The Voices of the Heart\\", which was also the title of the album's second single, featuring Israeli singer Miri Mesika. Segev also sat as a judge for the committee selecting the 2012 Israeli entry to Eurovision Song Contest. ◊î◊§◊°◊ô◊ì◊î ◊û◊ê◊ô◊î ◊ë◊ï◊°◊ß◊ô◊ú◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ô◊ñ◊ë◊ï ◊ë◊î◊¶◊ë◊¢◊î ◊ú◊ê◊ô◊®◊ï◊ï◊ô◊ñ◊ô◊ï◊ü (in Hebrew). make.co.il.

His diverse musical experience and unique sound have allowed him to work in many environments, but he is best known as a Latin jazz percussionist. He has performed in many famous jazz festivals around the world, such as the San Francisco Jazz Festival and the Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival, and has also played with some of the most notable jazz performers, including Paquito D'Rivera. Esperanza Spalding and David S√°nchez, Early life =Youth= Stable was born in Santiago de Cuba, the cradle of the island nation's most important center of culture and home of such elemental music styles as the Guajira and Son. Nurtured in a family that is deeply involved in the performing and visual arts and encouraged by his father Arturo Sr., a musician and a painter, the youngster began his formal study of music at the age of four, taking piano and theory lessons. =Early education= When his family moved to Havana, Stable continued his music education. He earned his first degree, in percussion, at the Amadeo Rold√°n Conservatory, an esteemed institution that has over the decades groomed the talents of countless other celebrated Cuban musicians, among them pianists Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Hilario Dur√°n and saxophonist Yosvany Terry. In 1993, Stable relocated to Puebla, Mexico, a metropolis south of Mexico City, where he polished his skills as a percussionist working as a sideman, performing everything from Latin jazz to rock and traditional Latin styles. He also began his career as an educator, teaching classical and Afro-Cuban percussion at the Puebla State University (Benem√©rita Universidad Aut√≥noma de Puebla). At the same time, he pursued a post-graduate degree in music education from the Puebla State Development University. Career development =2001‚Äì07= In 2001, Stable received a scholarship to study at the Berklee College of Music. By 2003 he had earned a degree in Contemporary Writing and Production and cultivated friendships with many of the musicians who accompany him on his solo artist career. After graduating from Berklee, he released his first album as a leader, called 3rd Step, in 2004. The album's name had its origins in a three-step process that Stable had planned to fulfill his dream of becoming a skillful musician. The first step involved moving to the U.S. in order to have the chance to fulfill his career goals. The second step consisted of furthering his learning and growing musically. Finally, the third step was to create a recording where he could apply all the lessons he had learned (thus far). Stable's debut album was received with warm reviews, including from Latin Beat Magazine, which stated: \\"Stable, who also composed and arranged, shows that he has staying power with this first project.\\" In the years following his debut album, Stable expanded his musical horizons and enriched his cultural knowledge. In July 2006 he played as a member of Javier Vercher's Sexteto for the 30th edition of the Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival (Spain). Stable contributed as a co-founder of Musinetwork School of Music (currently the most important music education website for Spanish speakers) in 2007. There, he has reached music students from all over the world who cannot afford the cost of studying abroad with great professors and has helped them master the skills and knowledge they will need to become talented musicians. Also in 2007, Stable released his second album as leader, Notes on Canvas, to several positive reviews including that of JazzTimes magazine, which stated: \\"Emotive melodies and masterful arrangements reflect his subjects' origins, while Stable thrusts directly to the center with powerful rhythmic leadership\\". In this superb Jazz masterpiece that includes the participation of more than a dozen of great musicians, Stable composed each tune inspired by 9 different paintings that Stable chose from his favorite pieces of art. The album's release was celebrated on December at Cacha√ßa Jazz Club, where Stable led a stellar quintet, featuring saxophonist Miguel Zenon, pianist Robert Rodriguez, bassist Edward Perez and drummer Henry Cole. =2008‚Äìpresent= Stable played a major role in the 10th International Puebla Festival (Mexico) on September 2008. During the closing of the event, Stable played as a featured guest with the Puebla State Symphony Orchestra, which performed one of Stable's compositions, \\"Suite Omnira\\". Following the success from the previous year, Stable returned to Mexico as the Adjunct Artistic Director of the first Puebla Jazz Festival in 2009. Here, he collaborated with the Puebla State University and other sponsoring institutions to bring an impressive arrangement of great musicians, including Newman Taylor Baker, James Newton, Dave Samuels and Stable himself among many others. In 2009, Stable also released his third album as leader, Call, which won \\"best album of the week\\" in the Latin Jazz Corner and received great reviews from many notable sources. Latin Jazz Network described it as \\"craftsmanship at its finest.\\" A few months after the album's release in 2010, DRUM Magazine wrote a two-page article about Stable and this newly released album, stating that Call \\"redefines the outer limits of Latin jazz through complex and compelling original works and an outpouring of virtuosic performances by Stable and his quintet.\\" While working resolutely in his career as a performer, Stable's never-ending thirst for knowledge made him return to the academy to pursue a higher degree in music. In 2010 Stable acquired a master's degree from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. In January 2012, Stable teamed up with Cuban pianist Elio Villafranca for an album entitled Dos y mas, on which the duo's similar backgrounds and musically rich experiences can be heard \\"as these two meld their minds and marry their musical intentions to create a program of organic, original music.\\" JazzTimes magazine stated that \\"their kinship goes far beyond technical facility or theory. It's more spiritual.\\" Stable currently resides in the U.S. where he also serves as an endorser of and clinician for Ritmo Percussion. Later in 2012, Stable is also preparing to release in partnership with Ritmo Studios a new line of instruments many of which are his own design. This master percussionist and talented composer is one of the most prominent upcoming Latin Jazz talents of his time. Discography =Albums as leader= *3rd Step (Origen Records, 2004).

The company was led by merchants such as 7-Eleven, Alon Brands, Best Buy, CVS Health, Darden Restaurants, HMSHost, Hy-Vee, Lowe's, Michaels, Publix, Sears Holdings, Shell Oil Products US, Sunoco, Target Corporation and Walmart. The initial retailers that were part of the company account for about $1 trillion in annual sales. In March 2017, the technology developed by MCX was purchased by JPMorgan Chase for its Chase Pay system.Digital wallet firm‚Äôs travails offer a lesson: Put customers before merchants CurrentC MCX's flagship product was CurrentC, a mobile payments platform. The system utilizes a smartphone app and digital wallet: to make a purchase, the user scans a QR code shown on the cashier's screen, or has the cashier scan a QR code from the phone's screen. Instead of transmitting financial data over the internet, the transaction uses a token placeholder that is then converted by the financial institution to initiate the Automated Clearing House (ACH), gift card, private label charge card or other type of payment and charge the consumer. The CurrentC app also includes features that will help the user locate a retailer, display coupons, display loyalty program details, and track receipts using data collected from transactions and the user's device. The system was designed by Joseph Corcoran and provided to MCX under NDA and based on the granted US Patent that he invented. Gemalto was contracted to provide the backend processing. Weeks after Dekkers Davidson became CEO of MCX, Dekkers favoured doing a deal with Paydiant instead (A company he already had a relationship with). The breach of the Gemalto contract resulted in a Court Judgment being granted to Gemalto against MCX for over $40 million. Paydiant is a startup based in Boston, now acquired by PayPal. The system, intentionally, does not support all credit cards, as one of its goals is to prevent merchants from having to pay their interchange fees. CurrentC transactions can directly debit customers' banking accounts via the ACH system. On launch, CurrentC supported the use of QR codes, Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and geolocation, unlike its competitors which mainly use near- field communications. CurrentC entered public beta for users in Columbus, Ohio in September 2015. The trial period at Target stores ended on June 30, 2016. = Reception = The soft launch of CurrentC was met with controversy. Critics felt that MCX members were engaging in collusion by attempting to prevent the use of competing, near-field communications-based contactless payment services, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay‚Äîboth of which are backed by companies involved in the wireless industry‚Äîat their establishments. MCX members Best Buy and Walmart explicitly stated that they would not support Apple Pay at their stores, while in late-October 2014, CVS Health and Rite-Aid silently disabled the ability to use NFC payments entirely. Although The New York Times reported that this was a contractual requirement which could result in fines if retailers do not comply, MCX CEO Dekkers Davidson denied this claim, stating that it was up to individual retailers to decide which payment systems they want to support, but made a statement implying a technological limitation preventing the use of the system alongside other contactless payment systems at the present time. Davidson later admitted that it had requested that MCX members implement exclusivity for CurrentC for a period lasting several months in order to give the platform \\"breathing room\\", and denied any direct order to CVS requiring that it stop accepting other NFC- based payment methods. On October 30, 2014, regional supermarket chain and MCX member Meijer denied any plans to disable competing contactless payment services. The security of the system was also a cause for concern: on October 29, 2014, the company revealed that some email addresses of participants and individuals participating in the pilot program had been accessed. No information about the number of individuals affected by this hack has been disclosed. CurrentC can also collect customer data for use by merchants: its privacy policy states that the service's software may collect location data for the purposes of completing transactions, protected health information during medical-oriented transactions, and information about the device and operating system the app is installed on. The service may, on an opt-out basis, also collect information for use in connection with marketing and loyalty programs. In response to the concerns surrounding its security issues and the anti-competitive actions performed by MCX members, a semi-organized campaign emerged on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store to give the CurrentC software negative and low-scoring reviews in protest. On April 28, 2015, Best Buy announced that it would begin to support Apple Pay at its locations, explaining that \\"today's consumers have many different ways to spend their money and we want to give our customers as many options as possible in how they pay for goods and services at Best Buy.\\" On August 11, 2015, Rite Aid followed suit by announcing that contactless readers would return to all of its 4,600 U.S. stores, giving Apple Pay and Google Wallet users the ability to use those services as a method of payment once again. = Deactivation = In May 2016, MCX announced that they were postponing a nationwide rollout of the CurrentC application.

He is a member of Syria's Catholic minority and is fluent in English and French. Makdissi graduated from Al-Nour high school in Damascus and studied in Paris at the ENA. He received his master's degree in Diplomacy and International Relations in 2009 from the University of Westminster and his doctorate from the unaccredited American University of London in Media Studies in 2011. Prior to becoming official spokesman, he had worked for five years in Syria's London embassy. On 2 December 2012 it was rumoured that he had been sacked from his position and left for the United Kingdom. Subsequently, additional rumours circulated stating that Makdissi had not been sacked but had instead defected. Al Arabiya News reported that a Syrian government spokesman had stated that he was on three months agreed leave while Hezbollah stated that he had been dismissed for \\"improvising statements\\" and Al-Manar TV reported that he was fired for straying from the official positions of the Syrian Government. In late December 2012, it was reported that Makdissi had fled to the United States. On 30 January 2013, it was reported on Asharq Al- Awsat that he had not defected to the United States or Britain, as had previously been reported, but rather travelled to visit his family in Lebanon and from there defected to one of the Gulf states (Abu Dhabi in the UAE), where he had arranged for residency for himself, his wife and his children. He was also reported to have launched his own private consultancy firm there. Makdissi issued a press release mid-February 2013 in which he stated that he had resigned because of Syria's \\"violence and polarization that left no place for moderation and diplomacy\\" and apologized to Syrian families if they had thought that he had not understood their suffering while in his diplomatic position. Makdissi gave a lengthy interview to The New York Times in January 2014 in which he talked about his political position as a Syrian Christian and independent politician. He said that a diplomat should serve his country and is not a lawyer who can accept any case, so when things headed towards an armed conflict with no more room for politics, he refused to be an advocate for one side and the diplomat inside of him won over. He also made it clear that he is an independent politician who believes in and works for a peaceful political solution in Syria and that he is a strong supporter of the Geneva platform and process. Makdissi gave another lengthy interview on 9 February 2016 for a Syrian opposition news site (The New Syrian) where he spoke for the very first time about his resignation and his political affiliation as independent member of the Cairo Conference for the Syrian Opposition and how he has been working for political transition in Syria based on the Geneva Process, Vienna Document and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. He said that the Syrian government never considered giving any real political concession to absorb the growing uprising in the street and . He stressed that Syrian Christians are among the founding fathers of Syria and not second-class citizens, and that they would continue to be the glue of the Syrian society; he also believes they can play the role of the bridge among other major sects in Syria. He stressed that there is no military solution in Syria and the only permissible way is a negotiated settlement and that an understanding among international powers, especially Russia and the USA, is a must to achieve such a transition.

Garfield received a bachelor of arts from Williams College in 1893 and a bachelor of science in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three years later. By 1898, Garfield had joined with Frank Meade to form the architectural firm Meade & Garfield in Cleveland, Ohio; the firm was noted for its residential designs. When the partnership ended in 1905, Garfield opened his own firm until 1926 when he along with Rudolph Stanley-Brown, George R. Harris, and Alexander Robinson started an architectural practice. In 1935 it was renamed Garfield, Harris, Robinson and Schafer until Garfield‚Äôs death in 1958. The firm, which still exists, is now known as Westlake, Reed, Leskosky Architects. Garfield specialized in residential architecture, designing large houses in Shaker Heights and other Cleveland suburbs, but his work also included more modest houses for the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority and institutional projects such as schools and a hospital. Garfield served as chairman of the Cleveland Planning Commission from 1930 to 1942 and was a founder and first president of the Cleveland School of Architecture, which became part of Western Reserve University in 1941. He was named a trustee of the university that year and two years later was made an honorary lifetime member of the board; he received an honorary doctorate from Western Reserve University in 1945.

A calibrated bandspread tuning control allows the main tuning to be set to a predefined spot on the control, and the bandspread allows tuning of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main tuning control. One method of adding a bandspread control was to put a relatively small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency.Joseph J. Carr The Technician's Radio Receiver Handbook, Newnes 2000; , page 60 A second method, mechanical bandspread, was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the bandspread dial moved the main dial through a small part of its range, improving the precision of tuning.C-W and A-M Radio Transmitters and Receivers TM 11-665 United States. Dept. of the Army, 1952; page 178 Bandspread controls were found on communications receivers, amateur radio receivers, and some broadcast receivers. With the advent of digital frequency synthesizers that could be set with high resolution by a keypad or incremental tuning knob, the requirement for bandspread control in many applications was eliminated. In the mid 1960s, some British portable radioshttp://www.thevalvepage.com/radios/bush/tr130/tr130.htm had a separate 'Bandspread' waveband covering the highest frequencies of the medium wave (AM) band (typically 1400 - 1600kHz) to simplify tuning of popular commercial stations such as the offshore Radio Caroline and the continental Radio Luxembourg.

The game was released worldwide in September 2013. It is playable in both traditional 2D and in 3D. Gavin Moore says Puppeteer plays better in 3D than other games because the camera does not move and his team used a method of 3D that has not resulted in a reduced framerate. Gameplay Puppeteer is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls the character 'Kutaro': a boy changed into an animated puppet and immediately decapitated. Throughout the game, Kutaro obtains various heads to replace his own, each enabling access to certain animations, and referring to the adjacent scenery. If Kutaro is damaged by an enemy or obstacle, he loses his head. Should the player not retrieve the head within a few seconds, it will disappear. Kutaro can hold three heads at a time, and when they are all lost, he restarts from the last checkpoint. The player can earn an extra life by collecting 100 \\"Moonsparkles\\" in a given section of the game. Throughout most of the story, Kutaro is armed with a pair of magical scissors, known as 'Calibrus', enabling him to cut through some portions of the scenery, and thus to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. He later acquires the abilities of the Four Champions of the Moon: the Knight's shield to defend against damage and reflect attacks, the Ninja's bombs to attack enemies and break obstacles, the Pirate's hook to grapple and pull enemies and change the scenery, and the Wrestler's mask and strength to body slam enemies and pull and push obstacles. His stated object is to acquire the shards of 'Moonstone' from the game's villains (in the process removing their influence from the scenery) and to free the souls of children like himself, from the malevolent figures containing them, all the while saving a Goddess in distress. The game is playable by one or two players. If two are playing, the second player controls Kutaro's companion (initially a ghostly cat named 'Ying-Yang'; later the fairylike 'Pikarina'), who can examine the scenery for foreign objects and find interactables, moonsparkles, and new heads for Kutaro. In single-player mode, the two analog sticks on the joypad each control a character. The game is presented as a puppet show in front of an audience, who can be heard cheering and laughing when impressive actions take place. It is divided into seven \\"acts\\", each of which comprise three \\"curtains\\". Each curtain has a set number of heads to collect, a set number of souls to rescue, and a hidden area to discover. For 100% completion, the player must revisit old curtains with new heads to complete it. Plot The story occurs in a concave world representing Earth's Moon, inhabited by pseudo-folkloric characters: the first half on the dark side of the Moon, and the second half on the Earthward side. Its premise states that the world's ruler, the Moon Goddess, was overthrown by her subordinate, Little Bear, when the latter seized her 'Black Moonstone' and the magic scissor-set 'Calibrus', and declared himself 'Moon Bear King'. Throughout the game, each of his twelve generals (the animals of the Chinese zodiac) has set part of the moon-world in disorder: each holding a portion of the Goddess' 'White Moonstone'. The player-character 'Kutaro' is one of many children whose souls were spirited away from Earth in their sleep and changed into animated wooden puppets to be enslaved in the King's mobile fortress, Castle Grizzlestein. After having his head pulled off and his soul devoured by the Moon Bear King, Kutaro is found in the dungeons by the Goddess's cat, Ying Yang, who leads him to his current mistress, the Moon Witch Ezma Potts. Potts, who is secretly planning overthrow the Moon Bear King herself, orders Kutaro to sneak into the throne room and capture the magic pair of scissors Calibrus. This weapon allows Kutaro to dispell the King's magic and defeat his puppets to release the souls within, allowing them to escape back to Earth. When the Witch demands the scissors, they adhere to Kutaro, and she allows him to use Calibrus to oppose the twelve generals. During the defeat of the first (General Tiger), Kutaro rescues Pikarina, Princess of the Sun, whom the Moon Bear King had captured. Under Potts' guidance, Kutaro and Pikarina venture to the various realms of the moon, to vanquish each general in turn: the Moonwood Forest guarded by Rat and Snake, the Moonshine Sea patrolled by Pig and Sheep, the Wild Wastes trampled by Bull and Horse, Hallowee-Ville controlled by Dog and Monkey, and the Land of Time conquered by Rabbit and Rooster, ultimately facing off against Dragon When the White Moonstone is re-assembled, Potts revealed to be as the Moon Goddess as she transforms back; but is instantly trapped by the Moon Bear King, and must be rescued by Kutaro. Propelled thereto by a cannon, Kutaro and Pikarina disable Castle Grizzlestein and reduce the Moon Bear King to his former shape of Little Bear, who surrenders the Black Moonstone in exchange for Kutaro's friendship, and restores Kutaro's head. All the twelve Generals are resurrected and converted from evil to good; and Kutaro, accompanied by Calibrus and Ying Yang, returns to Earth. Development On July 21, 2010, Sony filed a trademark titled Puppeteer. It has been speculated that it would be a game that would make use of the PlayStation Move technology in order to control the main character. Two years later, the trademark was later revealed to be indeed for a game with its official announcement at Gamescom 2012. In December 2012, Gavin Moore, the director of the video game, posted an entry on the European PlayStation Blog, stating that the video game is \\"Shaping up nicely, playing great and looking awesome. From January we will be polishing, refining and adding extra little details, to make the whole experience something fantastical and wonderful that PlayStation fans deserve. I will be in London for two weeks doing the Voice recordings in January, popping across to Budapest for the music recordings, then back to Japan with all my wonderful assets to shove them lovingly into the game.

It was resettled during the resettlement program of the 1950s and 60s. The community takes its name from a natural protuberance approximately 50 feet in height located (47.633829, -54.062453) on the extreme end of the peninsula surrounding the natural harbour; called the haystack. History Prior to any settlement within Haystack, its close proximity to good fishing grounds it served as a seasonal base for fisherman. As the number of migratory fisherman grew it developed into a more permanent settlement which the first Newfoundland government census of 1836 showed a population along with Paddy Poor's Cove (renamed Spencers Cove) of 33 individuals. In the 1845 census Haystack was no longer combined with Spencers Cove which recorded 11 people from two (2) families. In the 1857 Newfoundland census five (5) families with thirty-seven people in all were recorded. The families were of English origin. Grants were issued as early as 1847 for Robert Coffin, Thomas Rendell and Thomas Bugden. The population had reached forty-nine in 1869 and by that time it had both a Church of England church and school. The population had peaked in 1921 with 148 inhabitants. Lovell's Newfoundland Directory (1871) notes some of the first inhabitants of haystack as Robert Coffin, planter, and James Allen, Thomas Drake, Samuel and Thomas Gilbert, Edward Hanna, John King, Joseph Upshall and Isaac Wakeley as fisherman. The population of Haystack declined in population due to many factors, among which was the isolation and the spread of tuberculosis which took its toll on many of the young of Haystack. By 1945 the population had shrunk to 97 and by 1953 there were just ten (10) families remaining, with 23 children attending school. Resettlement With the population declining and businesses relocating to larger centres on the mainland portion of the Avalon Peninsula, it had hastened the relocation of many of the remaining residents of Haystack. By September 1957 the remaining three (3) families left the once thriving community. While the remaining three (3) families left one resident, Frank Drake remained. After 12 years of being the lone resident of Haystack, in 1969 Frank had left haystack and moved to Arnold's Cove, his house was towed and still remains there. It is now formally called the Drake House and was designated a Registered Heritage Structure on March 27, 2003 by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador. The property was designated as a representative example of those buildings that were floated out across Placentia Bay during the resettlement period. The building is listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.

Biography Gend√ºn Rinchen was born in a small cave by the side of the path to Paro Tagtsang, so as a child he was nicknamed \\"Dragphugpa\\" (Cave Man). At a young age he showed great interest in the Buddhist religion and at seven he received novice ordination at Tashich√∂ Dzong in Thimphu and was given the name Gend√ºn Rinchen. When he was twenty-seven he travelled to Lhodrak Lhalung, center of the tradition of Padma Lingpa in Southern Tibet. There he studied the Thirteen great texts of Mahayana Buddhist Philosophy from Khatok Khen Rinpoche. At the age of twenty-nine he went to Drigung in Central Tibet where he studied classical Tibetan orthography, grammar and poetry; the works of Mipham Rinpoche and Khenpo Shenga and received many tantric teachings including those on the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´nƒÅmasamgƒ´ti. Afterwards he went to Samye Monastery where he received the empowerments and instructions of the Rinchen Terdz√∂; the Nyingthig and Longchenpa's Dz√∂dun from Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje. After returning to Bhutan, he entered a three-year meditation retreat at the Tagsang Palphug hermitage, which was followed by another three year retreat he entered when he was forty at Kungach√∂ling in Paro. From Lopon Sonam Zangpo, a disciple of Drubwang Shakya Shri, he received teachings on the Six Yogas of Naropa, MahƒÅmudrƒÅ, and so on. For ten years he was the abbot of Tango Monastery where he wrote many commentaries on Buddhist philosophy, sutra and tantra. In 1990 he was enthroned as the 69th Je Khenpo of Bhutan and subsequently travelled throughout the country giving religious teachings. At the age of 61 he resigned from the post of Je Khanpo and retired to a life of prayer and meditation at Jangchub Ding in Yangchenphug. In 1997, on the ninth day of the third month according to the Bhutanese calendar, he died sitting in a straight meditation posture. It is reported that his body remained sitting thus for more than a week or eleven days during which time his body remained flexible and showed no signs of decay. His physical remains are now preserved in a gold and silver reliquary stupa in the Shabdrung Chapel of Tashich√∂ Dzong, Thimphu.

Article from Levante-EMV on 18 December 2008 Along their history, they have used repeatedly violence, especially their youth wing. Because of their frequent use of both verbal and physical violence, some reports regard GAV as a far-right terrorist group. Some of their threatening actions against education centers, and individuals, associations and democratic parties have been made with false names, such as Maulets 1707 or Colectiu Vinatea (sic).pg. 151 ‚Äì Vicent Flor's Noves Gl√≤ries a Espanya, Editorial Affairs, 2011  Historical background  The main Valencianism after the Spanish Civil War (the \\"new Valencianism\\", according to Joan Fuster) generally had a progressive ideology. Its main feature was a breaking-off from Francoist ideology and also against the tendencies of traditional Valencianism before the Spanish Civil War. The blaverism was born as a reaction against that. and the GAV was allegedly created in order to unify the regionalist people that defended Spain as their nation. They also tried to embody \\"traditional Valencianism\\". The ideas of new valencianism were considered by the GAV as the \\"essence and symbol of the imperialist pancatalanism that aimed at the annexation of the Kingdom of Valencia into the illegal Catalan Countries\\". With this kind of justification, during the Spanish transition, the GAV tried to create a controversial atmosphere in order to stop the process of the approval of the Valencian Country Statute of Autonomy. According to the critics of blaverism, the GAV had been infiltrated by important men and women from the Francoist right. Some people consider it a terrorist group. In fact, the UCD representative, Emilio Attard, introduced members from the GAV into the ranks of his own party. During the festivities of 9 October (the Valencian regional day) in 1979, a group of people linked to the GAV burned the Flag of the pre-autonomous Council of the Valencian Country, that was waving from the balcony of Valencia City Hall,http://www.antiblavers.org/galeria/displayimage.php?album=7&pos;=102 The crowned strip was the only part of the three official flags that did not burn.

Interview with Rafael Orellano in El Mundo on 9 October 2010 and who had been previously president of GAV. At the same time, some members of the Pre-Autonomous Council of the Valencian Country were assaulted. From then on, the GAV began to play an important role inside blaverism, and it claimed responsibility for violent actions, in order to try to justify their ideals.http://www.valencianisme.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=34&Itemid;=41 History of the Valencian flag with a blue strip where, among other information, the facts of 9 October 1979 are explained in detail.

Two terrorist attacks against Manuel Sanchis i Guarner's and Joan Fuster's lives (in 1979 and 1981 respectively) with extremely powerful explosives were made by people that in some respect were linked with the GAV. Nobody claimed responsibility for these actions. Nobody was prosecuted either. Nonetheless, according to the legal process, they were vandalistic actions. The fact that GAV has never claimed responsibility for these facts, but they have claimed responsibility for one terrorist attack against Sanchis-Guarner in 1978 as a \\"reaction of the Valencian people against the Catalanist aggression\\" and as a \\"not bloody action\\" show the ideological proximity between the aggressors and this organisation.http://webs.racocatala.cat/eltalp/guarner.htm Article from 2002 where the GAV claims responsibility for several violent actions, and one of them is the terrorist attack of 1978 against Manuel Sanchis Guarner. The text was published once the crime was prescribed, and so nobody could be condemned by these facts. Two months after these \\"vandalistic\\" acts, Sanchis-Guarner died of a heart attack. On the other hand, Joan Fuster acknowledged in a TV interview in 1992 that he had decided to abandon active social life because that terrorist attack had caused him to be depressed. Nonetheless, the GAV does not define itself as a fighting or terrorist group. In their magazine, SOM, the GAV justified the terrorist attack against Sanchis-Guarner in October 2002, just after the crime was prescribed, and therefore it was not possible to condemn the guilty ones.http://webs.racocatala.cat/eltalp/guarner.htm Reproduction of the article from 2002.

During this illegal demonstration, the members of this official institution were also attacked. On 1 December 2007, GAV members delivered pamphlets around La Garrigosa high school, in Meliana. These pamphlets contained photos and personal details of some of the teachers of this high school, such as their personal addresses. They were accused of being \\"Catalanists\\". In these pamphlets the neighbours were encouraged to \\"stand up against them\\". These actions are thus similar to making political \\"black lists\\". In January 2008, some GAV members wrote threatening and xenophobic graffiti on the walls of the cultural association Ca Revolta and the Centre Social-Bar Terra.GAV members attack the Social center-bar Terra These places had a strong link with Valencia's progressive and nationalist environment.

The victims had declared that they suspected GAV involvement. Some days before, members of this civic platform received death threats by phone, and the barrack huts that they used in order to store their materials had been attacked while they were making a demonstration against the speculation. Several objects were stolen, and other ones were broken or painted. The authors had signed in the barrack huts with the acronym \\"JJGAV\\".Tension grows in Catarroja In February 2008, the Valencian Nationalist Bloc headquarters were attacked by a group of people who put graffiti on the door and broke the lock. The BLOC linked these people with GAV. In November 2010 GAV sent a letter to UNESCO, in which they opposed castells becoming part of the World Heritage according to their standards. They argued that children that took part in that were in danger. They also had the aim of showing that in Valencia \\"there could be interferences of Catalan culture\\".

So they signed in 1981 the Normes del Puig (which state a different orthography for the Valencian variety of the Catalan language). It is a member and also founder of the Coordinadora d'Entitats Culturals del Regne de Val√®ncia (Coordinator of Cultural Institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia). The GAV has published several books and magazines according to their own orthographical rules. They have published books for children such as \\"Nelo i Carmeta\\", \\"Avant\\", \\"Pobles i gents\\", and also propaganda books such as \\"La Llengua Valenciana en perill\\", \\"Valencians front al catalanisme\\". Moreover, it created el \\"Colectiu de Mestres de la Secci√≥ de Pedagogia\\" (sic) (Group of teachers of the Pedagogy Section), which made dictionaries Valencian-Spanish/Spanish-Valencian according to the normes del Puig. The GAV has also created a prize, called \\"Premi Llealtat\\"(sic) (Loyalty Prize), which they give to the people that have kept their spirit of defense of the Kingdom of Valencia\\". Among the people that have received this prize, there are the following ones: Ricart Garcia Moya, Miguel Ram√≥n Izquierdo, Lleopolt Penyarroja and Josep M¬™ Guinot. Furthermore, they publish a magazine called SOM,http://www.antiblavers.org/galeria/displayimage.php?album=7&pos;=103 Cover of the \\"SOM\\", where we see how the pre-autonomous flag was burned which appears iiregularly. This magazine publishes opinion articles of authors that share the group ideology, they criticize the Valencian government, the corruption of the mass-media and the \\"attacks\\" from Catalanism against the Valencian people. This magazine made apology of the terrorist attack against Sanchis Guarner, acts of street violence or the agressionn of the Valencia mayor P√©rez-Casado on 9 October 1980, among others.  Youths  These days, the GAV looks for new supporters through the JJGAV (Youths of the GAV). This organization is quite often linked with other groups, such as Espa√±a 2000 (extreme right Spanish political party, with its headquarters in Valencia). Some GAV activists are even E2000 activists at the same time. The Youth's program is almost exclusively based on anticatalanist actions, such as the boycotts against Catalan products, demonstrations, protest acts, and so on. The GAV's Youths lawyer is Vicente Boluda Crespo.

The first National Water Policy was adopted in September, 1987. It was reviewed and updated in 2002 and later in 2012. India accounts for 18% of the world population and about 4% of the world‚Äôs water resources. One of the solutions to solve the country‚Äôs water woes is to create Indian Rivers Inter-link.chttp://greencleanguide.com/2013/09/13/national- water-policy/ India has been successful in creating live water storage capacity of about 253 billion cubic meter(BCM) so far. In a first, the ecological needs of river have also been taken into consideration. Salient features The major provisions under the policy are: #Envisages to establish a standardized national information system with a network of data banks and data bases . #Resource planning and recycling for providing maximum availability. #To give importance to the impact of projects on human settlements and environment. #Guidelines for the safety of storage dams and other water-related structures. #Regulate exploitation of groundwater . #Setting water allocation priorities in the following order: Drinking water, Irrigation, Hydropower, Navigation, Industrial and other uses. #The water rates for surface water and ground water should be rationalized with due regard to the interests of small and marginal farmers. The policy also deals with participation of farmers and voluntary agencies, water quality, water zoning, conservation of water, flood and drought management, erosion etc. National Water Policy 2012 The main emphasis of National Water Policy 2012 is to treat water as economic good which the ministry claims to promote its conservation and efficient use. This provision intended for the privatization of water-delivery services is being criticized from various quarters. The policy also does away with the priorities for water allocation mentioned in 1987 and 2002 versions of the policy. The policy was adopted with a disapproval from many states. Critics * Paradigm shift in approach from service provider of water to facilitator of service. * Policy does not deter use among those who can afford to pay for water. * PPP mode may not ensure equity. * Policy does not follow polluter pay principle, rather it gives incentives for effluent treatment. * Policy was criticized for terming Water as an economic good. * In some regions it has not yet become successful . * The policy does not focus on the reduction of water pollution. * The policy doesn't lay out objective for commercial use of water, especially ground water See also *Interstate River Water Disputes Act *Ground water in India *Irrigation in India *Water resources in India *Water scarcity in India *Water supply and sanitation in India *Water pollution in India External links *National Water Policy (Ministry of Water Resources Site) *Prime Minister of India during India Water Week 2012 * Water: Towards a Paradigm Shift in the Twelfth Plan, Planning Commission by Mihir Shah * IWMI Research report nos # 1, 3, 14, 56, 72, 83, 107, 111, 121, 123, 125 etc. * Indian climate change from Harappa period.

Performed together with percussionist and overtone singer Glen Velez, the recording is a journey into a state of meditation on the subject of life and death. The three relatively long pieces tell a story that's in turn relaxing and impetuous, and simultaneously modern and ancient, familiar and exotic sounding. \\"As always, Hellborg amazes with his skill and emotiveness.\\" (Walter Kolosky for Jazz.com) The album was awarded a Swedish Grammy for the best instrumental album of the year 1995. Album theme This music was written in a period when Hellborg was exploring the reality of Death, its symbolic meanings and its significance in human cultures. To evolve, people often have to die under a certain aspect, to put an end to an identity within, in order to continue with a new life chapter. The piece \\"Regicide\\" is inspired by the ritual, common in some ancient cultures, of killing their king at the end of his 7 years rule. This can also be seen as a metaphor for the contemporary public's mindset in making and breaking celebrities - when a star's popularity fades, he's forgotten (symbolically killed) and a new \\"king\\" is appointed. Instruments Jonas Hellborg plays two acoustic bass guitars on this album, an Ovation and The Roman Bass, an instrument custom built for Hellborg by luthier Abraham Wechter, also heard on some of his other albums (Aram of the Two Rivers, Silent Life, Octave of the Holy Innocents). Glen Velez, whose rhythms evoke the Middle East, India and Western Europe, uses as a main instrument is the frame drum, which has a drumhead diameter wider than its depth.

In the south of India, the halls are named mandapas which are often large halls with columns. As garbhagriha, it is most often built on a plan based on structures of squares and circles. However, for the temples of goddesses, the jaga mohan is built on a plan based on structures of rectangles and triangles. Such as for example the plan of the temple of Varahi Deula at Chaurasi near Puri in Orissa. Generally the garbhagriha is a windowless and sparsely lit chamber, intentionally created thus to focus the devotee's mind on the tangible form of the divine within it. On the contrary, the jaga mohan is highly decorated with sculptures of deities, mythologic scenes or ornements. The most famous is the one of the Temple of Surya at Konark. Due to the collapse of the main temple tower (shikhara), the jaga mohan now appears to be the main building of the temple.

She served as the President of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association from 1912 to 1920, and later helped organize the New Jersey League of Women Voters. She went on to serve as the Vice-Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee and unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in 1928.  Personal background  Lillian Ford was born on July 20, 1877, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the daughter of Herbert L. and Emeline Margaretta (n√©e Kirkland) Ford. Her father was a lawyer and her mother was a homemaker. She had three siblings, two brothers and one sister. On December 6, 1902, Ford married Edward Foster Feickert. They had one child, who died in infancy. Following their wedding, they moved to Plainfield, New Jersey, when Edward became an assistant secretary at the Plainfield Trust Company. In 1908, the Feickerts moved North Plainfield Township, near the foothills of Watchung Mountains. Between 1902 and 1910, Edward had served as assistant secretary and treasurer of the Plainfield Trust Company, followed by his taking the reins of the company as the Vice President of the company that would later emerge as the State Trust Company.  Professional background  After arriving in North Plainfield, Feickert began expressing a passion for women's rights, along with an interest in the women's suffrage movement. She also took on a leadership role in her local congregation at Grace Episcopal Church of Plainfield. She taught mission study classes for the Episcopal Church at both the local and state levels. She also became a member of local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association. New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association In 1910, Clara Laddey, President of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association appointed Feickert to serve as the organization's enrollment chairman. She served in this capacity for two years, quadrupling membership with a series of door-to-door campaigns and rallies during this time, and was consequently elected President of the association in 1912. Over the next eight years, she sharpened her political skills, as well as her leadership ability, and increased membership to over 120,000 members. Feickert was chosen as the leader of the New Jersey suffrage movement and represented them in attempts to gain the right to vote. After failing to have a state suffrage amendment approved in 1915, she worked harder than ever before and was selected to lead several organizations in their attempt to have the federal suffrage amendment ratified. The state legislature officially ratified the amendment on February 10, 1920. New Jersey State Republican Party In 1920, the New Jersey State Republican Party recognized Feickert's achievements and named her vice-chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. With this position, Feickert was assigned the job of organizing the Republican women in New Jersey. At the same time, she was also appointed treasurer of the New Jersey League of Women Voters, a position she left approximately a year later due to a difference of opinion regarding the direction the organization was headed. With more time on her hands, Lillian began focusing her attention on the New Jersey Women's Republican Club, of which she was President. Financial backing from the Republican organization allowed membership to reach up to 100,000 members. As a firm supporter of Prohibition and insistent women's rights activist, the Republican party cut off funding to the NJWRC and failed to re-elect Feickert as vice-chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee in 1925. The New Jersey Women's Republican Club slowly began to fall apart and was eventually replaced by the Women's State Republican Club of New Jersey in 1929. Feickert unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1928 as a pro-Prohibition candidate. Upon her failed attempt at Senate and the defeat of Prohibition, she stepped away from politics. Having divorced her husband in 1925, her remaining years were spent working on her home, reading, and traveling. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Saint Vincent's Hospital in New York City on January 21, 1945.

Early life Born in Pittsburgh, one grandfather was an assistant general manager on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, while the other was a trolley car driver. After studying law at La Salle University, Philadelphia, he attended law school at the University of Pittsburgh. Career =Conrail= After training as a lawyer, he joined Conrail in 1987 as a Vice President in the legal department, preferring to spend his working days in the train depot at Stanley Yard in Walbridge, Ohio, the primary classification yard for Toledo. After serving as Senior Vice President of Law and Government Affairs at subsidiary Consolidated Rail Corporation, he served as Group Vice President and General Counsel from May 1989 to April 1994. Moving into finance and accounting, O'Toole served as Senior Vice President from April 1996. From 1997, competitors CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) had been in a takeover battle for Conrail. However, under an agreement with the Surface Transportation Board, Norfolk Southern acquired 58 percent of Conrail's assets, including roughly 6,000 Conrail route miles; and CSX received 42 percent of Conrail's assets, including about 3,600 route miles.answers.com The agreement was put in place on August 22, 1998, under which newly appointed Chief Executive O'Toole transferred the lines to two newly formed limited liability companies, to be subsidiaries of Conrail but leased to CSX and Norfolk Southern, respectively: New York Central Lines (NYC); Pennsylvania Lines (PRR). The NYC and PRR reporting marks, which had passed to Conrail, were also transferred to the new companies, and NS also acquired the CR reporting mark. Operations under CSX and NS began June 1, 1999. In three major metropolitan areas - North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit - Conrail Shared Assets Operations continues to serve as a terminal operating company owned by both CSX and NS. The Conrail Shared Assets Operations arrangement was a concession made to federal regulators who were concerned about the lack of competition in certain rail markets and logistical problems associated with the breaking up the Conrail operations as they existed in densely populated areas with many local customers. The smaller Conrail operation that exists today serves rail freight customers in these markets on behalf of its two owners. A fourth area, the former Monongahela Railway in southwest Pennsylvania, was originally owned jointly by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;), Pennsylvania Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE;). Conrail absorbed the company in 1993, and assigned trackage rights to CSX, the successor to the B&O; and P&LE.; With the Conrail breakup, those lines are owned by NS, but the CSX trackage rights are still in place. O'Toole served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Conrail until 2001, succeed by Gregory R. Weber. Since 2008, he has served as both the President of residual Conrail company CRR Holdings LLC that owns the Conrail Shared Assets Operations, and is an independent director and member of the Audit Committee at CSX Transportation. =London Underground= While looking to retire, he was offered the job as Managing Director of London Underground. Appointed by Mayor of London Ken Livingstone in 2002, during his tenure O'Toole led the response to the 7/7 terrorist attacks: In light of his leadership during the terrorist attack, O'Toole was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2005 New Years Honours List. In February 2009, he resigned for personal reasons from his ¬£450,000 position, citing his requirement to spend more time with his wife who was unwilling to move to London. As one of his last acts, O'Toole secured an additional ¬£2bn of support from the Department for Transport in the wake of the collapse of Metronet. O'Toole commented before his exit, that Londoners should \\"scream bloody murder\\" if the Metronet upgrade of the Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines is delayed or scaled back because of funding problems. =FirstGroup= In May 2009, he was appointed a non-executive on the board of FirstGroup. Appointed Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief Executive in June 2010, in light of the retirement of Sir Moir Lockhead 21 years after founding the group, on 1 November 2010 O'Toole was appointed FirstGroup CEO. On May 31, 2018, O'Toole was asked to step down from his position at FirstGroup due to poor performance. Personal life Married to Patricia, the couple have two adult children, son Charlie and daughter Elizabeth. O'Toole and his wife maintain their main home in Philadelphia, while O'Toole has an apartment in Aberdeen where he spends around 50% of his time. The O'Tooles also maintain a winter home in Bonita Springs, FL. O'Toole plays golf off of a 12 handicap, and enjoys reading and travelling.

It was supposed to include the first supertall skyscraper in the city. The 403 meters high main tower of Okhta Centre is set to be the tallest building in Europe amongst live building proposals. This project, remained unrealised, was supposed to house headquarters of the Gazprom energy company, along with museums, library, sports and leisure facilities, and a concert hall. It was to be built in the mouth of the river Okhta, on the right bank of the river Neva.Ohta Center official web-site Its 403-meter high tower was conceived not only as a dominant, but also as a new symbol of Saint Petersburg. It was to be completed by 2016. However, the project met fierce opposition from citizens, civil groups, and international organizations.\\"Petersburg revolts against Gazprom- planned skyscraper,\\" \\"ITAR-TASS Daily,\\" November 24, 2006 When the project ideas were introduced to international jury, three out of four architects walked off the jury in protest, the competition was also boycotted by the Russian Union of Architects. It was eventually relocated to the new site Lakhta in Saint Petersburg in December 2010. The core design team of the Okhta Centre includes Chief Design Architect Charles Phu, Russian architect Philipp Nikandrov, Roger Whiteman and Tony Kettle. In 2008, Arabtec, the construction company involved in construction of the world‚Äôs tallest building in Dubai, has won a contract to build this 60 billion-ruble ($2.56 billion) complex. Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller claimed that he is \\"positive that St. Petersburg‚Äôs citizens will be proud of these new architectural masterpieces.\\" However, the Director of the Hermitage Museum, Mikhail Piotrovsky, has spoken out against the plan. Russia's culture ministry has also been reported to object to the tower's plan. As the historical centre of Saint Petersburg is a World Heritage Site in 1991; in December 2006 UNESCO World Heritage centre Director Francesco Bandarin reminded Russia about its obligations to preserve it and expressed concern over the project. In 2007, the World Monuments Fund placed the historic skyline of St. Petersburg on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites due to the potential construction of the building, and in 2009 reported that the tower \\"would damage the image of Russia.\\" In 2010 it was reported by Russian and UK press that the project's designer Charles Phu said at a public debate in London that the architect has been getting regular memoranda from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, encouraging them to go ahead with the project of Okhta Centre and promising support from the government. This was proved to be untrue according to Putin, Phu himself and the debate participants. This controversial report, followed by heated public discussions, has resulted in certain impact on the politics in Russia. Lakhta Center, presently under development on a site farther from Saint Petersburg's historic center, is based on the Okhta Center plans including its main tower, but on an even larger scale. __TOC__  Project design  Gazprom City project was first introduced in November 2006.

The decision was announced on December 1, 2006. In addition to the opinion of the jury, Gazprom invited the public to cast their votes on the company's web-site (it was closed after the project was renamed Okhta Center) and through the ballots distributed at the exhibit. Notably, the ballots did not provide a \\"none of the above\\" option, which automatically made all those who had cast their votes into supporters of the construction. Newsportal Vedomosti organized their own survey, asking whether respondents considered it an option to construct a 300-meter skyscraper on the site of the Nyenschantz fortress. Out of 735 respondents only 68 replied affirmatively.90% Against, SPB Vedomosti, Issue 215, November 17 2006 The proposed twisting tower is inspired by a Swedish fortress named Landskrona, occupied the site in the early 14th century, and another fortress Nyenschantz on the site until the 18th century in the form of a five-sided star to maximise views for defensive purposes. The inspiration for the design also comes from energy in water, with the building form deriving its shape from the changing nature of water and ever changing light. It gives a new interpretation to the historical fortresses with modern aesthetics and technology - transparency and democracy, internal and external interactions. It also features a unique environmental strategy, which acts as a low energy double-layered skin of the tower allowing maximum daylight and minimum heat loss in the extreme climate of the city. =Project description= The area of the complex was to be divided according to the following ratio: 35% - public use, 49% - business offices, 16% - offices of Gazprom and its subsidiaries. The complex was to consist of three main zones: Zone 1: Multifunctional high-rise complex. 396 meters high, 67 floors. The complex would have contained office spaces and parking, 67th floor would have been turned into an observation deck. Sport complex and conference hall were to be constructed next to it. Zone 2: Multifunctional cultural center. Museum of modern art, Museum of architecture, and a theater building were to be constructed in this area. Zone 3: Zone for prospective development, most likely to include sports and recreations center containing a swimming pool, skate ring, and fitness and spa centers, apartment hotel, and parking. Architects planned to create green zones and linear parks along the embankment of the river Neva. The 396 meter high-rise was to be pentagon-shaped in its base - a reference to the Landskrona fortification and Nyenschantz fortresses that were located at the same site in the 14th and 17th centuries respectively.Amanda Birch, \\"RMJM's Russian Odyssey,\\" bdonline.co.uk August 8, 2008 Remnants of the fortresses were uncovered during archaeological excavations that begun as a result of the contention around the project\\"Hearing on Okhta Center Pushed Back,\\" The Moscow Times, November 10, 2009, p.7 Financial scheme * 2006 scheme Originally, the 60 billion rubles construction was supposed to be 100% funded from the city budget.

In response, the Obama Campaign compared the organization's efforts to the \\"Swift Boat\\" attacks against Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004. The military portmanteau \\"OPSEC\\" is shorthand for operations security, wherein security measures are taken to prevent friendly operations and intentions from being observed by an adversary's intelligence systems. OPSEC, Inc. states that its members are primarily former U.S. special operations forces and intelligence community personnel. The group has extensive ties to the Republican Party and Tea Party movement, though it describes itself as non-partisan. As a 501(c)(4) organization, the group is not required to disclose its donors and it has declined to do so. Leadership and funding OPSEC's president is Scott Taylor, a former Navy SEAL and former U.S. Congressman from Virginia. Its lead spokesperson and former SEAL, Ben Smith, was also a spokesperson for Tea Party Express. Another spokesperson is Chad Kolton, who worked for the Bush administration as a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, and who was hired to perform media relations for OPSEC in July 2012 through HDMK, a Republican strategic communications firm. Public records filed with authorities indicate the group's treasurer, lawyer and television producers also have affiliations with Republican Party organizations. OPSEC registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization. Unlike 501(c)(3) organizations, 501(c)(4) organizations can participate in partisan politics. The group is not required to disclose its donors and OPSEC has declined to reveal them. In 2012, the group said that it had raised almost $1 million in donations. Dishonorable Disclosures On August 15, 2012, the group launched its criticism campaign of President Obama by promoting a 22-minute documentary style web video hosted on the organization's website and on YouTube entitled \\"Dishonorable Disclosures\\". The group announced they were planning on showing it in a handful of voting swing states, including Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Nevada. According to the New York Times, the video portrayed Obama \\"as a braggart taking credit for the accomplishments of special forces and intelligence operatives\\". (WebCite archive) Using interviews with a handful of former special forces and intelligence personnel, it accused the Obama Administration of leaking information and taking too much credit for killing bin Laden. The interviewees alleged that the administration intentionally leaked details about the raid on bin Laden's compound that would help terrorists identify the Navy SEALs involved. Ben Smith, identified in the video as a former SEAL, is seen saying, \\"Mr. President, you did not kill Osama bin Laden, America did. The work that the American military has done killed Osama bin Laden. You did not.\\" Fred Rustmann, identified in the video as a retired CIA officer, alleged that Hollywood elites were invited to the White House to be briefed on how the raid took place, and that the administration leaked \\"what kind of sources we had, what kind of methods we used, all for the purpose of making a Hollywood movie\\", referring to the film Zero Dark Thirty. Bill Cowan, identified as a retired lieutenant colonel, also alleged that President Obama divulged covert information to Hollywood, saying in the video \\"When we divulge national security information such as the identity of the organization that killed Osama bin Laden, we have now put all of those men, all of their families, everybody around them at some sort of risk.\\" =Reception= Peter Bergen, author of Man Hunt: The Ten Year Search for Bin Laden From 9/11 to Abottabad, wrote a critical analysis Dishonorable Disclosures. Bergen wrote that what precipitated the operation going public was not Obama's announcement of the raid but the crash of the Black Hawk helicopter and the arrival of Pakistani journalists at bin Laden's Abbottabad compound soon afterward. () Bergen added that U.S. Adm. Mike Mullen had advised Obama that Pakistan's top military officer, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, had asked for the U.S. to go public, persuading Obama to announce the raid sooner than was planned although Obama had initially preferred to wait for 100% DNA confirmation of bin Laden's death. Bergen noted that Obama's speech did not divulge the name of SEAL Team Six, instead saying that a \\"small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.\\"Transcript of Barack Obama's speech of May 1, 2011 (WebCite archive of 2011-05-09), Whitehouse.gov. Bergen wrote that as discussed in multiple news stories, SEALs are the principal Special Operations Forces in the Afghanistan/Pakistan theater, and that \\"obviously, a mission to take out bin Laden would not be entrusted to any other than these elite units\\" (referring to SEALs and Delta Force), adding that it remained unclear who first leaked the involvement of SEAL Team Six. Bergen also wrote it was \\"just plain wrong\\" that anyone in the U.S. government leaked the name of Dr Shakil Afridi, writing that this information first surfaced in The Guardian in July 2011 after Afridi was arrested by the Pakistani intelligence service. Bergen also wrote that it was entirely Obama's decision, made against the advice of both the vice president and secretary of defense, to launch the raid based on fragmentary intelligence that bin Laden might be there. Bergen also wrote that the United States' use of drones in Pakistan \\"is one of the world's worst kept secrets,\\" that disclosure of the Stuxnet virus attacks on the Iranian nuclear program had been reported since 2010, and that Iran publicly acknowledged the cyberattack two years earlier. Elizabeth Flock of US News questioned the group's claims to be non-partisan noting that \\"its ranks are filled with Republicans\\" and stating that OPSEC \\"has clearly taken a political side\\". News reports have described the group's ties to the Republican Party, noting that several prominent leaders of the group are Republicans and Tea Partiers and that it shares an office with a Republican consulting firm and a Republican polling firm. While the group described itself as nonpartisan, some of its leaders have been involved in Republican campaigns and Tea Party groups. The film's featured former SEAL members include one whose Facebook page identifies him as a spokesman for the Tea Party Express and several Republican campaigns, and OPSEC's president Scott Taylor ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for Congress in 2010. In a 2012 interview with the New York Times, Taylor acknowledged the Republican ties of some members but said that \\"as many or more (of the film's participants) are apolitical.\\" While the film portrayed President Obama as a \\"braggart taking credit for the accomplishments of special forces and intelligence operatives,\\" during the video clip of Obama announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden, the portion in which Obama credited the \\"tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals\\" was deleted by the filmmakers. In a CNN interview in 2012, Admiral William H. McRaven, a former commander of United States Special Operations Command, said that Obama \\"shouldered the burden\\" for the operation, \\"made the hard decisions,\\" and was \\"instrumental in the planning process.\\" The Obama campaign compared it to the discredited \\"swift boat\\" smear tactics used against presidential nominee John Kerry in 2004. A spokesperson said, \\"No one in this group is in a position to speak with any authority on these issues and on what impact any leaks may have had, and it's clear they've resorted to making things up for purely political reasons.\\" Leaders of OPSEC responded by stating the group is non-partisan and unconnected to any political party or presidential campaign. The military veterans political action committee called VetPAC has said \\"OPSEC is a shadowy Republican front group,\\" and called their video \\"dubious\\" and \\"silly\\". Juliet Lapidos of the New York Times called the OPSEC video \\"a dishonest hatchet job\\" and remarked that while the stars of the video presented themselves as concerned citizens with no partisan motivations, their positions were inconsistent with their decision to appear in the video. Military journalist and former Marine, Geoffrey Ingersoll, reported in Business Insider that the video is a partisan effort instead of an effort to protect US troops, saying, \\"Obama used SEALs to kill bin Laden. Republicans are using them to eliminate Obama.\\" References External links *Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund (website) *Dishonorable Disclosures at the Internet Movie Database *Dishonorable Diclosures on YouTube *Official \\"President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden\\" showing the May 1, 2011 speech by President Obama, posted to YouTube channel \\"whitehouse\\" on May 1, 2011 (WebCite archive). *Whitehouse.gov transcript of Barack Obama's speech of May 1, 2011 (WebCite archive of 2011-05-09) announcing the death of Osama bin Laden.

Heyting (1915-1995) and writer A.Th. Heyting (1879-1949). Source: Hendrik Nijkeuter (2005), De dichter en de wichter: Verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting. Verzorgd en ingeleid door dr. H. Nijkeuter, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek (pp. 18 & 42) was a Dutch poet, playwright, radio personality, children's book writer and painter. Writing in Dr√®ents (except for his Dutch-language children's books and some poems in Dutch), he was one of the earliest Dr√®ents writers to express personal themes and is considered to have been \\"the first true, modern Dr√®ents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways\\".Heufdstuk 13. Taolmuziek veur 't wichie: Hans Heyting, in: Stieneke Boerma and Rouke Broersma (1993), Dr√®entse schrieverij, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek (p. 130) Youth Heyting was born along the Beilervaart, not far from the village of Beilen. He and his three sisters grew up in a poor family of gereformeerd (reformed) creed. His father was a clogmaker and poached on the side to add to the family income; in his spare time he painted and drew. Reflected on his father's artistic activity, Hans noted that he \\"painted small landscapes, very primitively, with brushes made of his own hair. When he'd been to the barber, he took tufts of hair with him. Ja! None of his work was kept.\\"Hendrik Nijkeuter (2005), De dichter en de wichter: Verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting. Verzorgd en ingeleid door dr. H. Nijkeuter, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek (p. 18) When he was about ten, his father died; he and his sister found the body. From this point on, Heyting - who detested the suffocating atmosphere at the reformed school - became alienated from his surroundings. He remarked on his faith that he was taught: \\"I felt God was spying on me all day long. At night I sensed an angel standing by the bed. I was terrified because I could feel the draught of his wings beating.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 18 Around this time he met his later fellow Dr√®ents poet, Roel Reijntjes, who was also from Beilen. Heyting was expelled from vocational school in Hoogeveen for blowing up the bicycle shed with a homemade bomb. Various contacts outside his family caused the rift between him and his background to grow; later he would cut the ties completely. He worked as an electrician's apprentice and a paperboy for some time. Work as a painter Because of a humpback - presumably caused by rickets - Heyting was unable to perform strenuous physical labour. He was trained as a painter at the studio of Louis Kortenhorst in Assen, painting mainly children's portraits. The journalist and religion teacher G.A. de Ridder, whose children he portrayed, introduced him to literature. Heyting's interest in art and literature grew when he met Hendrik Fernhout, an authority on literature who was being cared for at psychiatric institution Beileroord. Fernhout especially familiarized Heyting with the poet Rilke. Heyting's physician Meijering proved another influence on his intellectual development. Heyting made friends, and fell in love, with Ina Konings, a girl who was sixteen years younger and who lived next door to the Heytings. He painted and drew her and gave her a prominent place in his later poems and children's books. It was long thought that she died of tuberculosis at age thirteen and because of this, lived on as Heyting's muse. Heyting stated: \\"She has become my inspiration. She always shows up in my work. (...) Because she died, she stayed alive for me.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30 However, in 2005 Dr√®ents scholar Henk Nijkeuter established that she was still alive and living abroad. Life in Borger In 1944, during World War II, Heyting went in hiding at a general practitioner's in the village of Borger. He later said, \\"At the end of the war, in 1944, I got in trouble with Fritz. I went about freely and that was no longer permitted. I was afraid I'd be arrested.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) pp. 19-20 He briefly returned to Beilen just after the war, but memories of his reformed childhood drove him back to Borger, where he would stay for the rest of his life. He painted in the post-war years, joined the Drents Painters Society and wrote about painting in the periodicals Erica, Drenthe, and Nieuwe Drentsche Volksalmanak. In 1946, Heyting lived for a while with painter Anton Heyboer, whose interest in Drenthe had been fanned by Vincent van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo. In the same year, Heyting joined the painters' association De Drentse Schilders (which existed from 1946 to 1954) and exhibited his work in Assen and Emmen. Following the exhibitions, he got many commissions for portraiture, but he had a growing conviction that he lacked the requisite talent. About this he wrote in a poem, \\"Is it pointless? Something fleeting, this laborious digging down? / Has everything he does not been done better?\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 24 The Drentse Schilders collective disintegrated due to conflicts between members; at one point, Heyting and two of his colleagues had spent the association's funds on booze.Nijkeuter (2005) p. 23 The portraits painted by Heyting are in various private collections. Many of his paintings were destroyed when the museum farm he was living in burnt down in 1967. The few extant still lifes show an affinity with the Magic Realist style. After the fire, Heyting focussed more on writing, and \\"gradually his work took on a literary dimension\\".Boerma and Broersma (1993) pp. 120 & 125 In 1954, Heyting married Wilhelmina Carolina Hilverink ('Wil') from Hengelo. Radio work Heyting became a stage director at the dramatic society of Borger. At private parties after performances, he often recited his work, played the lute and sung his own compositions. In 1950 he was seriously injured when jumping off the stage and was bedridden for almost a year. In 1951, he directed his own play De vr√∂mde v√∂gel (The oddball) about a painter who settles in a Drents village. He became active as a writer and performer at Regionale Omroep Noord, the regional radio station, and got voice training from the station's director. He wrote Dr√®ents texts for singers De Thrianta's and presented a fortnightly programme on art in Drenthe. Heyting performed in his own radio play Schuppen is troef and grew out to a popular radio presence in the province. His radio sketches feature village characters, their merits and especially their shortcomings. The Dr√®ents-language programmes on regional radio strongly helped awaken people's interest in the regional language. At age 62, Heyting quit radio work because it was becoming too much of a physical burden. At the time of his radio work, Heyting was also employed at the library for the blind in Groningen, for which he selected voices to record material. Poetry Heyting published four collections of his own poetry: Tweetalig (Bilingual, 1973, with poems in Dutch by Harm Werners), Spiegelschrift (Mirror writing, 1977), Toegift (Encore, 1983) and Dubbelfocus. Een cyclus gedichten (Bifocal. A poetry cycle, 1986). As to why he had only collected his poetry at a late stage, he declared, \\"You see, I'm not the type to peddle my own work\\".Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32 In the nineteen-fifties, Heyting was a member of the Drentse Schrieverskring, the Dr√®ents writer's circle. His first poems were published by the Dr√®ents-language monthly Oeze Volk which he helped found and of which he was a long-standing editor. In 1966-1967 he was the sole editor for a year, when the editorship was continued by writer Bart Veenstra. From 1980 on, Heyting published in the avant-garde Dr√®ents literary magazine Roet, of which he was also an editor for a number of years. Heyting was initially influenced by traditional Dr√®ents-language poets such as L.A. Roessingh and Jan Naarding, writing anecdotal verse in archaic Dr√®ents. Later, he was one of the first Dr√®ents poets to distance himself from traditionalist poetry. Dr√®ents poet Gerard Nijenhuis a friend of Heyting's, wrote about this change, \\"Concepts are no longer described in detail, but only hinted at. (...) Moreover, the content becomes more 'condensed'.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 30 Marga Kool, a fellow Dr√®ents poet, discerns two main themes in Heyting's poems, \\"the safe home as contrasted with the stupid, frightening outside world\\" and \\"the girl who has passed away\\".Nijkeuter (2001), De \\"pen gewijd aan Drenthe's dierbren grond\\" : literaire bedrijvigheid in de Olde Lantschap, 1816-1956, Groningen: RUG (doctoral thesis, p. 560) The first theme is exemplified in the poem Spiegelschrift (Mirror writing): :We would like to stay :together for a long time to come, :press our threadbare bodies together :firmly yet softly and listen to :the wind and rain singing :and write the following words :on the steamed-up windows: :'two children, orphans, sheltered here' :from outside it's mirror writing :but outsiders needn't read itNijkeuter (2005) p. 48 The other key theme, the deceased girl, is reminiscent of the poetry of Gerrit Achterberg, which is informed by a similar theme.Nijkeuter (2005) p. 31 Heyting also shares Achterberg's penchant for choosing technical words as titles for poems (Optiek, Dubbelfocus, Concaaf). Heyting's poems often express highly personal sentiments, which was rare in Dr√®ents poetry before the nineteen-eighties.Nijkeuter (2001) p. 560 Roel Reijntjes saw as Heyting's central theme the pain of being a loner, an outsider, different from others, including physically; socializing with many yet feeling lonely.Nijkeuter (2005) p. 32 Using the pseudonym Hans Heideknupper, Heyting wrote nonsense verse which was published in several publications; he prepared a collection of comic poems, Het malle vel (The silly skin), which was never published. Further writing Most of Heyting's books appeared in the seventies and eighties: poetry volumes, translations and nine children's books. Heyting began to write children's books at the suggestion of writers Gerard Nijenhuis and Anne de Vries. He wrote them in Dutch (there was no extant market for children's books in Dr√®ents). He felt a strong affinity for children, something about which his friend G. de Jonge declared, \\"Hans loved children and this shows clearly in his poetry and writing. Children also loved him. This was obvious when on Saturdays our grandchildren and their parents went to visit the Heytings. (...) Not a word was spoken, gestures and looks of understanding were enough. Hans started to read to the children and their thumbs went into their mouths.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 34 Heyting's novel Om je dood te schamen (Shame!) was voted best children's book of the year by a children's jury in 1979; a year later his novel Eva en Bert alleen (Eva and Bert alone) was awarded the same distinction. Heyting later distanced himself from his early children's books, saying that the publishers had restricted him too much. The stories had to be sweeter than he had intended to write them, and he was asked to scrap passages in Dr√®ents.Nijkeuter (2005) p. 35 Heyting received a lot of fan mail, mainly from girls aged 12 to 15 who wore glasses just like the stories' protagonists. Many of his fans also visited him. In 1974, Heyting was awarded the Cultural Prize of Drenthe; in 1979 he received the golden medal of honour in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Heyting retreated from public life in his final years. He deteriorated physically, suffered pains and had a cancer operated on. When he could no longer cycle, he made his way through the village on an electric motorcycle. He declared to Gerard Nijenhuis, \\"I wouldn't like to die, I love life dearly. I think I will reconcile myself with the prospect of death fast. It's just, I would just like to spend some more time with my wife.\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 38 Hans Heyting died in 1992 in the Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen. After his death A few months after his death, Roet magazine dedicated an issue to Heyting. A bust of Heyting by Bert Kiewiet was placed in the centre of Borger. The plaque reads, \\"Writer, poet, recorder of the Dr√®ents language. Co-founder of Dr√®ents monthly OEZE VOLK. The Oeze Volk Foundation has placed this commemorative bust on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. To honour Hans for his services rendered to Drenthe and its language.\\" In 2004, the Dr√®ents language institute Drentse Taol (now Huus van de Taol) released a video portrait of Heyting entitled Een kapotte bril (Broken glasses) on DVD. In 2005, publisher Het Drentse Boek released Heyting's collected poems, De dichter en de wichter: verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting. Edited by Henk Nijkeuter, the collection includes a short biography and a bibliography. The publisher released a CD in 2006, Drentse dichters lezen: Hans Heyting, on which Dr√®ents writers read poems by Heyting. Critical assessment Heyting's early dramatic work was received positively: the monthly Drenthe wrote that his play De vr√∂mde v√∂gel \\"is vastly better than what has appeared so far in this field\\"Nijkeuter (2005) p. 27 His children's books were characterized by the Lectuur-repertorium as \\"easy-to- read, unpretentious popular stories for young people\\"Nijkeuter (2001) p. 564 Dr√®entse schrieverij, a history of Dr√®ents literature, judges Heyting's book Esther en het geheim van opa (Esther and grandpa's secret, 1983) to attain the level of well-known children's book author Guus Kuijer.Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 121 With regard to Heyting's painting, Drentse Taol refers to his artistic shortcomings, in contrast to the verdict on his poetry, \\"His poems in Dr√®ents are among the best work written in Dr√®ents.\\"Drentse Taol, Hans Heijting (1918-1992). Schriever van de maond oktober 2005 Dr√®entse schrieverij concurs, \\"Hans Heyting's work, especially his poetry, has great authority. Coming from the restricted tradition of dialect writing, he innovated it, moving from general themes such as descriptions of nature and village life to writing about issues as personal as grief about a deceased child, longing for a lost love, trying vainly to conquer death. [...] Heyting can be seen as the first true, modern Dr√®ents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways.\\"Boerma and Broersma (1993) p. 51 Selected works * De kat in 't gaoren.

Coincident with the advent of early personal computer platforms such as Vector Graphic and Northstar, which utilized the CP/M operating system, Roizen was able to develop his \\"Table Maker\\" software for individual use on personal computers. Not only was his software one of the earliest spreadsheet programs, it can also claim title to the earliest ‚Äòintegrated application‚Äô as the program was also a capable word processor and early database system. Roizen renamed it T/Maker and sold the first version through software distributor Lifeboat Associates of New York. In 1983 he co-founded T/Maker Company (with his sister Heidi Roizen) to take over sales and distribution of T/Maker and other software products. Roizen went on to develop other software products, including T/Master and \\"I Hate Algebra\\" as well as the early internet communications product Touchpoint. In 2005, he created WildWords, a board-based word game. He has been included in Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions..., History of the Personal Computer, Wicked Problems, Righteous Solutions: A Catalogue Of Modern Software Engineering Paradigms, and multiple issues of InfoWorld in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000.

The material includes previously unavailable oral histories conducted in 1977 with major participants including David Beck, late President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. It also includes an excerpt from a biographical film of Anna Louise Strong, a key strike leader and journalist who became a key figure in the American Left through the 1960s, which shows the only known footage of the strike.

From that position it developed an important change in the Spanish publishing sector by intensifying the sales of encyclopedias through fascicles. The Salvat Group associated with the Boroli family, owner of De Agostini,La Editorial Salvat , en la Enciclopedia Catalana (in Catalan). which had initiated the sale through fascicles in Italy. For that purpose, they created a new distribution company, Marco Ib√©rica S.A.

His brother-in-law and major shareholder (Juan Vil√° Reyes) was condemned of swindling as he benefited from loans and export tax exemptions by falsifying sales contracts. The conviction was upheld by the Spanish Supreme Court in 1976.Ratificaci√≥n Sentencia Matesa, (in Spanish). Manuel Salvat had secured these credits without having knowledge of doing so because his brother-in-law had signed them, using his name fraudulently.

Patterson scored a century on his first-class cricket debut for New South Wales in November 2011, becoming the youngest batsman to score a century in Sheffield Shield cricket. In January 2019, he made his Test debut for Australia against Sri Lanka, becoming the 457th person to play test cricket for Australia. He made a century in just his second test match in Canberra, also against Sri Lanka. He was not selected for the 2019 Ashes series and returned to play domestically in the 2019/2020 season.  Early life  Hurstville Oval. Home ground of Patterson's club, St George Kurtis Patterson was born in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville and grew up in Roselands and then Lugarno. He was born into a family with a strong sporting pedigree. His mum Dana played volleyball for Australia and his father Brad played cricket for Northern Districts in Sydney‚Äôs first grade competition. Patterson went to high school at Christian Brothers in Lewisham. He played much of his junior cricket with St George Cricket Club. Aged 13, he played for St George in the AW Green Shield, which is Sydney‚Äôs premier cricket competition for under 16‚Äôs. Playing Green Shield again the following year, he scored a total of 442 runs at an average of 88.40. By the time he was 17, Patterson was playing first grade for St George. At the start of the 2011/2012 season, he scored two centuries in the first 4 rounds, which saw him be selected to make his debut for New South Wales. Domestic career Patterson made his Sheffield Shield debut for New South Wales against Western Australia in November 2011. He made an immediate statement by scoring 157 in the first innings and remaining 6 not out in the second innings as New South Wales won the match by 6 wickets. This performance earned him the player of the match honours. His century in the first innings saw him become the youngest player to score a century in the Sheffield Shield. At the age of 18 years and 206 days he broke the record that was previously held by Barry Shepherd, who scored a century aged 18 years and 241 days in 1955. Despite this initial success, he was not selected to play for New South Wales for the rest of the season. Patterson returned to the New South Wales side during the 2013/2014 season, playing 7 out of 11 games. Throughout the season he scored a total of 403 runs at an average of 31.00. He scored 4 half- centuries during the season, including 52 in the final against Western Australia, which was won by New South Wales. Patterson produced similar statistics during the 2014/2015 season, scoring 372 runs at an average of 28.61. Patterson‚Äôs break out year came during the 2015/2016 season. Play all but one game, he scored a total of 737 runs at an average of 52.64, which included two centuries and four half-centuries. This made him the highest run- scorer for New South Wales that season and the 6th highest run-scorer in the whole competition. He was then selected for Australia A to play in a 2016 winter series against South Africa A and India A. In two unofficial test matches against South Africa A, Patterson made scores of 74, 6, 92, and 50 not out. This made him the highest scorer in the series among both sides. During this offseason, he also played 6 one day matches for Australia A in a quadrangular series against India A, South Africa A, and Australia‚Äôs National Performance Squad. His stand-out performance in the series was a score of 115 against India A in a match that Australia A won by 1 run. Still aged just 23 and with a first-class batting average of 42.91, Patterson was now in contention for national selection. Before the start of the 2016/2017 season, former New South Wales and Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin said that Patterson could be in contention to play for Australia that summer. He furthered his case by scoring a century against Queensland in the first round of the 2016/2017 Sheffield Shield season. After this innings, New South Wales coach Trent Johnston said he believed Patterson was ready for test cricket and deserved a chance at international level. However, Patterson was not selected for Australia and played out the rest of the season in the Sheffield Shield. Although he did not score a century for the rest of the season, he still finished the season with 668 runs at an average of 44.53. This was followed by another strong domestic season in 2017/2018 where he scored 672 runs. This marked the second time in three years that Patterson was the highest run- scorer for New South Wales. Despite his consistent run scoring ability, questions began to be asked in the media about his ability to convert his half-centuries into bigger scores. However, in round 5 of the 2018/2019, he made a score of 107 not out against Western Australia, his first Sheffield Shield century since 2016. Between that time, he had scored a total of 14 half-centuries without scoring a century. = Domestic One-Day Career = Since 2013, Patterson has played for New South Wales in Australia‚Äôs domestic one-day competition. In his first year playing in the competition, he played 7 out of 8 matches and made 152 runs at an average of 25.33 as New South Wales finished runners up in the competition. He following year he had a slightly improved season, scoring 230 runs at an average of 32.85. He had his most successful season in the 2016 competition when he averaged 49.40. In the final, Patterson scored 77 not out as New South Wales won the title. Just before the start of the 2018 competition, New South Wales captain Peter Nevill broke his thumb, and Patterson was named as the new captain. He had a difficult start as captain as New South Wales lost the first 3 games of the season. He also struggled individually, averaging 23.80 for the season. After being in contention for a Test call-up in the 2017‚Äì18 Ashes series, Patterson played every match for New South Wales in the 2017‚Äì18 JLT One-Day Cup, scoring two fifties and averaging 41.33 runs per innings to be one of the team's top run-scorers for the tournament. During the 2019 season, Patterson was hampered by a quad injury, playing only two matches in the competition. = Big Bash Career = For the inaugural season of the Big Bash League, Australia‚Äôs franchise Twenty20 competition, Patterson was offered a roster spot by the Sydney Thunder. However, he turned it down to focus on making the New South Wales Sheffield Shield side. In the second season of the Big Bash, Patterson was signed by the Sydney Sixers franchise for the 2012/2013 season. In his first season, he only played one game for the Sixers. The following season, he was signed by cross-town rivals the Sydney Thunder. Patterson was not regularly selected for the Thunder, playing only 9 games in each of the next three seasons. In later seasons of the Big Bash he began to play for games for the Thunder but failed to make a significant impact. In his time at the Thunder, he played a total of 25 matches in 8 seasons with a total of 438 runs and a high score of 48. Just before the start of the 2019/2020 Big Bash season, Patterson signed a 3-year deal with the Perth Scorchers. He missed the opening rounds of the season due to a hamstring injury. He finally made his debut for the Scorchers in January 2020, however, after scoring 38 runs in 3 matches, he was dropped for the remainder of the season due to lack of runs. International career During the 2018/2019 season, Patterson was selected to play for a Cricket Australia XI side against the touring Sri Lankans as a warm-up for the test series. Patterson scored unbeaten centuries in both innings, with 157 not out in the first innings and 102 not out in the second innings. He was named the player of the match. Despite this performance against the Sri Lankans, the Australian squad for the test series had already been named the previous week and Patterson had not been included. However the selectors backtracked and he was added to Australia's Test squad for the series against Sri Lanka. He made his Test debut for Australia against Sri Lanka on 24 January 2019. He had his baggy green cap presented to him by Michael Hussey. Batting at number 6, he made 30 off 82 balls in his first test innings before being dismissed LBW. He was not required to bat in the second innings as Australia won by an innings and 40 runs. He also took three catches in the match, including a diving, one-handed catch in the gully to dismiss Dilruwan Perera. He was retained in the side for the second match in Canberra. In this test he scored a century, the first of his Test career as Australia romped to a huge total, with Joe Burns and Travis Head also scoring centuries. Patterson finished with a score of 114 not out. With Travis Head also scoring his first test century in the same innings, it was the first time since 1989 that two Australian batsmen had made their first test centuries in the same innings. Both his parents and many of his friends were in the crowd when he reached his century. He did not bat in the second innings as Australia beat Sri Lanka by 366 runs, winning the series 2-0.  2019 Australia A tour of England  Following the conclusion of the test series, Patterson returned to play for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield. He finished the competition with a total of 724 runs, making him the 5th highest run-scorer for the season. This meant that Patterson was suddenly in contention for selection in the Australian side due to tour England for the 2019 Ashes series. Patterson was selected for the Australia A team that toured England in the lead up to the Ashes. These matches were considered to be crucial in deciding who would be selected for the Ashes. Before this tour, Patterson had only played 8 weeks of club cricket in England and he struggled to make runs. He scored 4, 32, and 28 for Australia A before scoring 2 and 0 in an intra-squad trial match. Ultimately, Patterson was not selected for the series, with Chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns saying Patterson was desperately unlucky to not be selected. Hohns also said the return of Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft from their ball-tampering suspensions pushed players like Patterson out of the side.  Injury and 2020 season  At the start of the 2019/2020 season, Patterson suffered a quadriceps injury playing grade cricket for St George. While he started the Sheffield Shield season for New South Wales, he reinjured his leg while fielding against Tasmania and missed several months of cricket. Several studies have shown that with the introduction of Twenty20 cricket, players are more likely to get injured., which could prove problematic for modern cricketers like Patterson. This injury also meant that Patterson did not have a chance to impress national selectors before the Australia test squad for the summer was named. On his return from injury, Patterson only played 3 matches for New South Wales before the Covid-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the last round of the season. Patterson stated towards the end of the season that he did not think the injury was affecting his batting. He was also selected for Australia A against England Lions in February 2020. He top-scored with 94 not out in the second innings of the match.  Patterson against the Pink Ball  Since the introduction of day-night first-class cricket in 2013, one particular strength of Patterson has been his batting performances against the pink ball, which is used for these day-night games. Before being selected for Australia in 2019, Patterson had an average of 57.31 against the pink ball. This was compared to his usual batting average of 40.93. This was speculated to be a reason why he included in the side for his debut match against Sri Lanka, a day-night game in Brisbane. These statistics are more significant as batsmen have generally struggled against the pink ball in comparison to the red ball. Evidence has shown that the pink ball is more difficult for batsmen to see during twilight. It has also been suggested that a batsman‚Äôs timing could be negatively affected when playing against a pink ball at night. On facing the pink ball, Patterson said that while facing the pink ball is very different at night, he believes he has played enough cricket with a pink ball that he can adjust.

History The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company was founded in 1968 by Jeraldyne Blunden as a performance outlet for students at Jeraldyne's School of Dance. Blunden picked students from her school for the dance company, acquiring twelve female dancers by 1972. One of these original dancers was Blunden's daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs, who would later become artistic director of the company. In 1973, the company performed Blunden's ballet, Flite, earning the honor of being the first African-American group to gain membership to the Northeast Regional Ballet Association Festival. The company soon produced its first large scale performance in 1976, also marking the first time the dancers were paid for a performance. They performed Black Snow, a collaboration with acclaimed composer Roy Meriwether at Dayton's Memorial Hall in front of a sold-out audience. Blunden shaped the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company as a repertory company through her continuous invitations for renowned guest artists to create pieces for her dancers. Young, budding choreographers, including Ulysses Dove, contributed to the growing company's repertory. DCDC's outstanding repertoire includes works by world class master choreographers such as Eleo Pomare, Alvin Ailey, Ulysses Dove, Merce Cunningham, Donald McKayle, Rennie Harris, and Talley Beatty. Today, DCDC continues to acquire new works by contemporary choreographers including Bebe Miller, Warren Spears, Dianne McIntyre, Shapiro and Smith, and Ronald K. Brown. To further expand its repertoire, DCDC commissioned works inviting Bill T. Jones, Garth Fagan, Dwight Rhoden and Doug Varone to participate in DCDC's What Dreams We have and How They Fly. This four-piece program premiered in 2003 to celebrate Dayton's native sons, the Wright Brothers‚Äô first flight 100 years ago and will artistically explore what the invention of flight means to our contemporary world. 2013-14, as part of DCDC's 45th Anniversary, 10 new works were commissioned for DCDC by choreographers' Kiesha Lalama, Ronen Koresh, Ray Mercer, Donald Byrd, Alvin Rangel, Rodney A. Brown and more. The company's apprenticeship dance corps, DCDC2, was established as the pre- professional wing of the rising touring company under the leadership of Kevin Ward. In 1990, Blunden fell ill and Kevin Ward became the new artistic director of the company. Blunden's daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs, became the new director of DCDC2. Since, former DCDC dancer Shonna Hickman-Matlock has become director of DCDC2. Kevin Ward retired on July 1, 2007, and Debbie Blunden-Diggs became the company's new artistic director.

In a racing career which lasted from June 2006 to October 2007 the filly ran nine times and won four races. After winning once as a two-year-old, Light Shift won the Cheshire Oaks on her second appearance as a three-year-old. She then won the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom, beating the Irish filly Peeping Fawn. Light Shift never won another race, being beaten by Peeping Fawn in the Irish Oaks and the Nassau Stakes and finishing unplaced in the Prix de l'Op√©ra. Background Light Shift was a bay mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings a breeding company run by the Niarchos family. Light Shift's sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Her dam, Lingerie, failed to win a race but was a daughter of Northern Trick, a mare who won the Prix Vermeille and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Before Light Shift, Lingerie had produced the Prix Jean de Chaudenay winner Limnos and Shiva, a mare who won four races including the Group One Tattersalls Gold Cup. The filly was trained throughout her career by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Ted Durcan. Racing career =2006: two-year-old season= Light Shift began her career in a six furlong maiden race at Newmarket in June in which she finished second, half a length behind the winner Wid. She then finished third to Princess Taise in a seven furlong maiden at the same course a month later. In September she was moved up in distance to one mile and recorded her first win in yet another Newmarket maiden. Starting the 15/8 favourite, she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Sunlight. She ended the season being rated 83 by the Racing Post, suggesting that she was at least thirty pounds below top class. =2007: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Light Shift ran in a ten furlong race for colts and fillies at Newbury. She produced a strong run in the straight and took the lead in the final furlong before winning by one and a quarter lengths from Kid Mambo. She was then moved up in class and distance for the Listed over eleven furlongs at Chester. Starting the 11/8 favourite, she accelerated to lead in the closing stages and won comfortably by three-quarters of a length from the Aidan O'Brien-trained All My Loving. In the Oaks at Epsom on 1 June, Light Shift started at odds of 13/2 in a field of fourteen fillies, making her the fourth choice in the betting behind her stable companion Passage of Time and the Irish runners All My Loving and Four Sins. Durcan restrained the filly in the early stages before moving up to challenge to leaders in the straight. Light Shift took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and opened up a clear lead before holding off the strong late challenge of the Aidan O'Brien-trained outsider Peeping Fawn to win by half a length. All My Loving was four lengths further back in third. The win gave Henry Cecil his eighth win in the race and his first Classic success for seven years. In the Irish Oaks on 15 July, Light Shift was again matched against Peeping Fawn, who had won the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes in the interim. Light Shift, the 9/4 favourite despite her trainers concerns about the soft ground, raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight, but was soon overtaken by Peeping Fawn and finished second, beaten three and a half lengths. Three weeks later, Light Shift and Peeping Fawn met for a third time in the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood. On this occasion, Light Shift made some progress in the straight, but could never reach the lead and finished third, five lengths behind the Irish filly and three and a half lengths behind the runner-up Mandesha. Following the race, Cecil suggested that the filly would be aimed at the Breeders' Cup. After a break of two months, Light Shift reappeared in the Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp. She started the 11/4 favourite but finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Satwa Queen. Cecil said that the filly's \\"flat\\" performance may have been the result of a long and demanding season. Assessment and honours In the 2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Light Shift was given a rating of 117, making her the equal seventh best three-year-old filly in the world six pounds below Rags to Riches. Stud record Light Shift was retired to become a broodmare for the Niarchos family. Her first foal, a colt sired by Dansili, was born on 4 February 2009. She was subsequently covered by Galileo. 2009 DR YES (FR) : Bay colt, foaled 4 February, by Dansili (GB) ‚Äì won two races and placed twice from 6 starts in England 2012 2012 Mosuo Bay filly, foaled 12 March, by Oasis Dream (GB) 2013 Ulysses (IRE) : Chesnut colt, foaled 20 March, by Galileo (IRE) ‚Äì won five races including G1 Eclipse Stakes at Sandown; G1 International Stakes at York; G3 Gordon Stakes at Goodwood; G3 Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown and placed three times, including 2nd G3 Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor; 4th US-G1 Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita from 11 starts to date (8/24/17).

Rought-Rought was a left-handed batsman. He was born at Brandon, Suffolk. Rought-Rought made his debut for Norfolk against Hertfordshire in the 1926 Minor Counties Championship. He made 123 appearances in the Minor Counties Championship for Cheshire before World War II. He made his debut in first-class cricket in 1933 for HDG Leveson Gower's XI against Oxford University at The Saffrons, Eastbourne, with him making a further first-class appearance in that season for the team at the same venue against Cambridge University. He scored 129 runs in his two matches, which a high score of 61 against Cambridge University. Playing minor counties cricket for Norfolk allowed Rought-Rought to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, with him making his debut for the team in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders in 1937 at the Rose Brothers Ground, Gainsborough. He made a further first-class appearance for the team in 1938 against Oxford University at the University Parks. In his two first-class matches for the team, he scored 100 runs, with a high score of 50 against the New Zealanders. He served during World War II in the Royal Norfolk Regiment, holding the rank of Lieutenant in 1940. He was captured in France in 1940, spending most the war as a Prisoner of War. He attempted to escape captivity, but was unsuccessful on his first attempt. In 1945, he made a second attempt at escaping captivity, this time succeeding in his escape and returning to England. Following World War II, Rought-Rought returned to playing minor counties cricket for Norfolk, making sixteen further appearances, the last of which came against Buckinghamshire in 1948. His brothers, Rodney and Desmond, both played first-class cricket. The three brothers all had long careers for Norfolk, where they encouraged the young Bill Edrich. He later wrote, \\"many a time they gave me a quiet hint or bit of advice that was invaluable, and which occurred to me many a time afterwards, in the strenuous, hard grind of a Test match\\".Bill Edrich, Cricket Heritage, Stanley Paul, London, 1948, p. 210. The brothers' unusual surname originated with their father, who was born Albert William Rought Whitta. His maternal grandfather William Rought left him the family hatters and furriers business in Brandon on the condition that he adopted the surname Rought. He became Albert William Rought-Rought.

Trkulja is one of the first artists who composed, performed, and popularized Balkan Traditional Music with a modern approach in arrangements. He is the founder of the Modern Balkan Tradition music genre, although he is most famous for his collaboration with Metropole Orchestra from Netherlands in 2008. Aside from playing 13 instruments,Slobodan's Interview for Creative Art Magazine, April 2011 Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad called him \\"one of the most beautiful male voices of the Balkan.\\" NRC article on Slobodan's voice, Jan 1, 2002 He had no formal music training until 1997, but attended a public high school in Sremski Karlovci. Slobodan moved to Netherlands in 1997, and returned to Serbia in 2008, where he has been since. Biography =Early life= Trkulja was born in Od≈æaci on May 29, 1977. At the age of 10 he taught himself to play the clarinet. After clarinet, Slobodan learned to play dozen more instruments in the next eight years. At the age of 14, he started playing in the professional folk ensemble Kolo in Belgrade. In less than a year he was announced the best instrumentalist at the \\"Festival of Music Societies of Vojvodina\\".http://www.kultura- vojvodina.org.rs/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=88&Itemid;=105 He spent the next four years focusing on his high school education and performing with Kolo. In 1998 Slobodan went to Amsterdam, where he studied at Conservatorium van Amsterdam, Saxophone Department, an instrument which he had played less than a year and a half at that point. In 1999, right before the NATO bombing of Serbia, he returned to his homeland and postponed his education until the end of the war. Trkulja continued with his studies in February 2000. In 2004 he graduated, and three years later he received his Master‚Äôs Degree of Arts with honors and an award for his MA concert. =Religious influences= Slobodan claims to have recognized the true gist of music upon entering his religion, when suddenly he experienced a revelation of different and unknown musical views and fields. The feedback that he got from religion was reciprocal, because he entered faith through music. ‚ÄúOne day, I went to the Kovilj Monastery and experienced a great temblor inside my soul the moment I heard monks chanting. For me it was an out-of-body experience, an un-earthy feeling‚Ä¶ something that shook me to that extent that I felt physical changes inside.\\" Slobodan was threading deeper into the faith and realized that in great part Serbian traditional singing and traditional songs were immensely based on Byzantine chants. ‚ÄúMany melodies in old Serbian songs are almost exactly the same as Orthodox Christian music‚Äù, says Trkulja. \\"The predominant emotion in our tradition is an emotion weaved with spirituality, because our people couldn‚Äôt make music that was not close to their souls. What I personally as a musician like the most about these melodies is that they are infinite. They start and keep on going, they are endless as a prayer. At one moment it overwhelms you and you forget about yourself, about your ego, about your problems, about all the things that make you feel bad. It‚Äôs like you're bathing your soul in a pure, beautiful energy that nurtures you from inside.\\"TV Interview with Slobodan on TV Slobomir, Nov 25 2011 Music career =Balkanopolis= In 1997, in the clubs of Novi Sad, Trkulja started playing music that was inspired by Serbian music and Balkan tradition, but had strong modern influences from the west. Pursuing his dream further, he founded the group Balkanopolis, with whom he held many concerts and published an independent album titled Let Iznad Balkana (One Flew Over the Balkans). Western musicologists consider his sound a new genre that they call ‚ÄúModern Balkan Tradition.‚Äù Ever since, under the Balkanopolis influence, many musical groups ensued and continued to weave the Modern Tradition into the Serbian music scene. This exposure brought him a lecturing invitation for the \\"International Ethno Camp\\" in Sweden. Slobodan was featured as an artistic leader, representing the Balkan countries in the \\"mix of world music\\" in Stockholm. Today Trkulja plays 13 instruments in total. Clarinet since he was 10; bagpipes, diple, double, kaval, flute, acoustic guitar since he was 15; flute since age of 18 and tenor saxophone since 19. Today, besides all of these, he plays the drums, Armenian duduk, ocarina, alto and soprano saxophone. In addition to his talent for playing, Slobodan Trkulja also has impressive singing abilities, which he developed by listening to traditional Serbian throat-singers. The most respected Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad called him \\"one of the most beautiful male voices of the Balkan.\\" In 2005 he played at the neo-Balkan music concert ‚ÄúVeƒçiti most‚Äù (\\"Eternal Bridge\\") at the exhibition Expo in Japan.Official website of the Japanese festival Expo in 2005 He performed at Exit 2006th, completely alone on stage, in front of three thousand people.

At the benefit concert ‚ÄúDar za Hilandar‚Äù (\\"A gift for Hilandar\\"), April 13, 2004 in the Sava Center, Trkulja performed his song Lepe moje crne oƒçi (Beautiful black eyes of mine). In December, same year ‚Äì same place, with Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra and ‚ÄúBalkanopolis‚Äù, Trkulja held a groundbreaking concert, conducted by Arjan Tien, called Prizivanje ki≈°e (Invocation of rain) where he singlehandedly introduced Serbian traditional instruments to contemporary music. This concert was held on the occasion of the completion of the Dutch presidency of the European Union organized by the Netherlands Embassy in Belgrade.

At the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, in a traditional New Year‚Äôs concert, January 2002, he performed his Pythagora Oro, together with Dutch Brass Ensemble. The performance at this concert (which was directly transmitted by the Dutch television) was the high point of Trkulja‚Äôs career, which gained him admiring reviews and earned him recognition in the Netherlands. On February 6, 2005 he won the Dutch Erasmus Prize for performing jazz saxophone and clarinet pieces for 45 minutes with drummer Arie Den Boer as his only accompaniment. Other than a sum of money from Rotterdam Conservatory,Official news-press of the Rotterdam Conservatory - Codarts Magazine , Nov 2007 the prize included a number of concerts at the renowned jazz clubs in the Netherlands. = Concert for Babies= In 2011 Slobodan performed a concert he specially designed for babies and children. This concert was followed by a workshop in which the audience could musically interact and play the instruments with Slobodan.Article about the Concert for Babies on B92.net, Oct 25, 2011 This concert took place in SKC Novi Beograd, Belgrade and, as part of the Pokreni Se (Move) project, it was done in collaboration with the students of the Belgrade Academy of Music and Center for Culture and Information Kissaro. This was one of 33 projects that were supported by Center for the Promotion of Science of Serbia. ARENA CONCERT Slobodan Trkulja organised a humanitarian concert \\"Balkanopolis & friends\\" in Belgrade Arena on 15 May 2015. Special guests were fado diva Mariza, soul singer/composer Oleta Adams, Lebanese young star Mayssa Karaa and renown singer from Senegal Baaba Maal. In front of the 10.000 people in the audience, Balkanopolis was the first neo-traditional group to perform their own concert in a venue of that scale, marking their 18th birthday. Summary Trkulja‚Äôs music is described as contemporary art and intelligent synthesis of traditional Serbian music and modern jazz and fusion, asymmetric bars of Balkan rhythms and grooving beats of modern funk, which entail unprecedented examples of rhythmic fireworks. He does not hesitate to use exotic, almost delirious time signatures like 25/8. He employs vocal counterpoint parts in which he plays with different textures, which produce a powerful effect in his melancholic ballads. He claims that he is not narrowed by genre. Trkulja once said that for him music making is not subject to any kind of classification. On Beovizija 2007 Slobodan Trkulja and ‚ÄúBalkanopolis‚Äù competed with his composition ‚ÄùNebo‚Äù (‚ÄúSky‚Äù), which combines traditional and Byzantine ecclesiastical chant. They won second place with 10/12 points of TV audience votes and 7/12 points of votes of the jury as well as the prize for best interpretation assigned by the Eurovision Fan Club Article about the OGAE Serbia award on evropesma.org, Mar 11, 2007(OGAE Serbia). The song ‚ÄúNebo‚Äù also was a representative at the annual OGAE Serbia OGAE ‚ÄúSecond chance‚Äù contest 2007 in Slovenia. Slobodan Trkulja and Balkanopolis took 14th place at the Eurovision Contest 2007.

History The club was founded as a worker's sports club on 2 September 1903. In 1913, the club was declared a leftist political organization by the authorities of the German Empire and dissolved. A new club, Neue Freie Turnerschaft Braunschweig, was formed shortly after. The Neue Freie Turnerschaft had to disband again in 1933 because of financial problems, caused by the construction of a new stadium for the club. Its successor Freier Sportverein Braunschweig was formed in January 1933, but shortly after, in March 1933, banned as a socialist club by the new Nazi government. The club was refounded after World War II under its original name. In 1952 the club was promoted into the second tier Amateuroberliga Niedersachsen-Ost. The stint proved short and FTB were relegated again after two seasons in 1954, spending the next 20 years at the 3rd or 4th level of German football, before slipping down as far as the 7th division during the 1980s and 90s. The club finally returned to the Niedersachsenliga in 2000, now the 5th tier. Here the club usually finished in the upper half of the table, but narrowly missed the qualification for the new single-division Niedersachsenliga in 2010. After three seasons in the 6th tier Landesliga Braunschweig, the club returned to the Oberliga in 2013. On 21 April 2014 the Turner reached the final of the Lower Saxony Cup, which also secured FT Braunschweig's qualification for the 2014‚Äì15 DFB-Pokal ‚Äì the club's first ever participation in the main rounds of Germany's national cup competition. The semi-final, played in front of 6,350 spectators at Eintracht Braunschweig's Eintracht-Stadion, was won 1‚Äì0 against VfB Oldenburg. The final, which had no bearing on DFB-Pokal qualification, was lost 1‚Äì2 against BSV Schwarz-Wei√ü Rehden. In the first round of the 2014‚Äì15 DFB-Pokal, FT Braunschweig then lost 0‚Äì4 against Bundesliga side 1. FC K√∂ln. In the 2013‚Äì14 Oberliga season, the newly promoted side finished second, qualifying for the promotion play-offs into the Regionalliga Nord. In the play-off round, FT Braunschweig finished second behind VfB L√ºbeck, thus gaining their first promotion into the Regionalliga. It finished last in the league in 2014‚Äì15 and was relegated again.

He worked for various political campaigns and in the office of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, eventually becoming an organizer for M.I.C.A.H., a Milwaukee- based interfaith coalition that advocates social justice.

Barnes's campaign made major issues of Fields's support for the school voucher program and opposition to limiting interest rates charged by payday loan companies, whose charges can exceed a 500% annual percentage rate. Barnes defeated Fields in the August 2012 primary with 2,596 votes to Fields's 1,206.

Some political observers, such as professor and former State Senator Mordecai Lee, expressed surprise, noting both the rarity of Democratic Senate primaries and the 90% reelection rate for incumbents in Wisconsin. Some also framed the race as reflective of the broader struggle in the Democratic Party, pitting a young progressive challenger against an older, more centrist incumbent.

The sport itself is not played, but rather, aspects of the business side of the sport are decided upon.

An age requirement of 16 to 25 was set and an athletic background was also sought. 4,800 applications were received for the scheme, 3,854 of which met the eligibility criteria. 2012 Summer Olympics Ten participants in the scheme were members of Team GB at the 2012 Summer Olympics and one of them was a medal winner: Helen Glover won gold in the women's coxless pairs rowing. She was a cross country runner, swimmer, hockey and tennis player but had no rowing experience prior joining the scheme in 2008. At 178 cm tall Glover did not meet the minimum height standard specified for the scheme but she stood on tiptoes when she was being measured at the selection event. Victoria Thornley finished fifth as a member of the women's eight rowing crew.

History The group was founded in April, 1992 by actors Anna Papadakos, Carlo Alacchi, filmmaker Pascal Maeder and soundman Dave Ballard for the production of the original play Dummies in the Window. The production took place in the vacant store below Papadakos and Maeder‚Äôs apartment on Montreal's Boulevard Saint- Laurent.Voir Review (in French), April 19, 2000Park Canada description of Boulevard Saint-Laurent's cultural history, April 15, 2009 The actors commissioned installation artist Pierre Allard to create a storefront display. While the artist was setting up, a falling dummy shattered the glass window and crashed on the sidewalk, missing Montreal Gazette's reporter Albert Nerenberg by only a few feet. Nerenberg wrote an article titled \\"Crashing Dummies\\" about the incident that prompted the group to use the term Dummies for their play title and theatre name. With no money to promote the show and a strong creative intention to build a \\"street theatre environment\\" by behaving like \\"barkers\\", the actors stood in front of the venue before the performances to lure passersby. The popularity and success of the initial two-week run allowed for an extension of two weeks. Papadakos, who took on the role of Artistic Director in addition to writing and directing the shows, was motivated by the show's success and a desire to create a \\"conscious\\" theatre. She launched a financing drive and caught the attention of Canadian philanthropist, Phyllis Lambert, who saw it as a way to rejuvenate neighborhoods through art. With the assistance of The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation and various other sources, the newly formed theatre company raised enough funds to produce a second play, Return of the Dummies, the following year in a bigger vacant store a few doors up the street. In the fall of 1995, the group completed its trilogy on immigrants with Dummies 95 in yet another empty store on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent. Opening of the play Go Weast in Montreal, Dummies Theatre, 1996 In 1996, the group created Go Weast, the first of three pieces on alienation. As the early 1990s recession was ending in Montreal, empty stores filled with new businesses and the group rented the second floor of a newly moved grocery store (Segal's), which later became the home of Mainline Theatre. Go Weast's success and subject matter along with its stunning dream-like 16mm original footage of visuals of Canada and Canadians attracted the attention of Marie-Helen Falcon of Festival de Th√©√¢tre des Am√©riques making Dummies Theatre the first English Theatre company from Qu√©bec to be invited to partake in the international event.FTA Real life lies elsewhere for the writers/actors/film-makers of the Montreal company Dummies The play Medea in the Media followed in 1998 and was performed in the same space, which had become the company's permanent home. In 2000, the group produced its last creation before disbanding, Dummies in the Mirror. This was an introspective piece that used the lighting technician as a third actor with a wired console providing the only illumination. Content, experimentation and form Immigrant identity, culture shock and tensions, relationships with the self and the other, alienation and identity in general were the main themes of the Dummies. The sets, designed by Maeder, were primarily minimalist using surveillance cameras, video and original 16mm black-and-white footage projected through windows or reflected through mirrors, props and found objects.

The first committee of the Manly Art Gallery was appointed in 1924 and included Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo, Percy Nolan, Charles Bryant, Herbert Marriner, Hermon Slade, Henry Forsyth and Percy Gledhill and the collection was initially housed in the Town Hall. The present building was formerly an outdoor concert pavilion opened in 1922 and its adaptive re-use was made possible with the closure of the proscenium arch. The Newly adapted building was opened by the Chief Justice of New South Wales Sir Phillip Street. At the time of the building opening the collection already housed 200 exhibits including 79 paintings and 62 historical photographs. In March 1939, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo presented 100 works to the young gallery including his own paintings, works on paper, watercolours and etchings. This donation included works by W. Lister Lister, Harold Septimus Power, John Seymour Lucas and Grace Cossington Smith. An annex to house this collection was opened in 1940, and is known as the Dattilo-Rubbo Room, and on his death he bequeathed more of his paintings and ¬£500 to the gallery. P S Garling donated 55 paintings in 1947, including works by George Washington Lambert and William Piguenit. In 1966, during the chairmanship of Keith Jones, the gallery was extended with an additional gallery, a storeroom, a new ceiling, a new entrance through the Rubbo annexe and improved lighting. Many works were acquired for the gallery through the Manly Art Prize (1962‚Äì1984). In 1968 Clarice Thomas held the first ceramic exhibition and a major bequest by Lady Askin in 1984 has made the ongoing display of these works possible. In 1981, Clarice Thomas was appointed full-time Director of the gallery after acting as Honorary Director for some fourteen years and a grant was received from the NSW Ministry for the Arts contributing towards the cost of building a museum to adjoin the gallery.

The Memorandum was jointly written by Ismail Kemal bey Vlora and Luigj Gurakuqi. Copy of the Gre√ß√´ Memorandum (1911) Memorial plaque of 2011 in Ahu i Gre√ß√´s (Beech of Gre√ßa) near Selca Requests The leaders of the Albanian Revolt of 1911 organized a meeting at the location of Gre√ß√´ near Selc√´ village in Kelmend. Today, this location is a natural and cultural monument of Shkod√´r County listed as \\"Ahu i Ger√ß√´s\\". Ismail Qemali joined them and together they draw up the memorandum, sometimes referred to as the \\"Red Book\\" because of the color of its covers, which addressed their requests both to Ottoman Empire and Europe (in particular to the Great Britain). This memorandum was signed by 22 Albanian chieftains, four from each tribe of Hoti, Gruda and Shkreli, five from Kastrati, three from Kelmend and two from Shal√´. Requests in the memorandum included: * General amnesty for all participants in the revolt * Demand for recognition of the Albanian ethnicity * Election of the deputies of Albanian ethnicity for the Ottoman Parliament according to the proportional system * Albanian language in schools * Governor and other appointed high officials have to know Albanian language and all other positions in the administration have to be reserved only for people of Albanian ethnicity * Men who are ethnic Albanians to serve army only in Albania during peacetime * Confiscated arms to be returned * All Albanian property damaged by Ottoman troops to be compensated The Memorandum was submitted to the representatives of Great Powers in Cetinje, Montenegro. It was drafted by Qemali as a reply to amnesty offered by Ottoman military commander Shefqet Turgut Pasha on 18 June. Afterwards Although the Sublime Porte tried to minimize the effects of the Memorandum by treating it as a local initiative of the Mal√´sia region, it gave the Albanian struggle for independence a strong boost. Leaders such as Namik Delvina, Muharrem Rushiti, Musa Demi, Spiro Bellkameni and Qamil Panariti and their chetas strengthened the pressure on the Ottoman authorities to accept requests of the Memorandum. In a July 17 meeting held in a monastery in Cepo, delegates from all kazas of Janina Vilayet declared that they will fully support the Gre√ß√´ Memorandum. They sent a letter to the Sultan, there they appealed for the implementation of the Memorandum and the treatment of the Albanian people as a whole. This countered with the aim of the Sublime Porte to treat the Memorandum as a local issue of Mal√´sia. After the letter was sent, the secret committee of Janina organized a number of new armed acts. They planned a culminating action on July 23, in the anniversary of the Young Turk Revolution but failed. Later, some other efforts failed, and the Memorandum of Gre√ß√´ gradually lost its importance. The coming events and situation in 1912 enabled Albanians to better organize their efforts, and consequently to successfully declare the independence of Albania from the Ottoman Empire.

Albert F. Canwell as he appeared at the 1948 Canwell Committee hearings. The Interim Committee on Un-American Activities or Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities, most commonly known as the Canwell Committee, (1947-1949) was a special investigative committee of the Washington State Legislature which in 1948 investigated the influence of the Communist Party USA in Washington state. Named after its chairman, Albert F. Canwell, the committee concentrated upon communist influence in the Washington Commonwealth Federation and its relationship to the Democratic Party in Washington, as well alleged Communist Party membership of certain faculty members at the University of Washington in Seattle. The Canwell Committee is remembered as one of a number of state-level investigative committees patterned after the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) of the United States Congress. The committee ultimately published two printed volumes collecting the testimony of witnesses before it. The committee was terminated by the Washington legislature in 1949, following the electoral defeat of its chairman and several of its members in the elections of 1948. Background The Seattle General Strike of 1919 shook up the rather progressive Seattle area (here, cover of the Union Record for Monday, February 3, 1919) Becoming a state only in November 1889, Washington was a relative latecomer into the United States of America. As was the case in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Dakota Territory, an indigenous frontier radicalism was prevalent in the state, making the Socialist Party of Washington one of the largest state affiliates of the Socialist Party of America on a per capita basis of the pre- World War I progressive era. Seattle had been the site of a General Strike in February 1919 which had captivated the attention of the nation. Although the Socialist Party of Washington was shattered organizationally by the Socialist- Communist split of 1919, strong radical sentiment remained among many in the state. Washington had proven hospitable to the Farmer-Labor Party in the election of 1920 and to the independent campaign of Robert M. La Follette in 1924 and this tendency only deepened with the onset of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The state's continued left-of-center political climate provided fodder for Postmaster General James Farley to jest about the USA consisting of \\"forty-seven states and the Soviet of Washington.\\"Jane Sanders, Cold War on Campus: Academic Freedom at the University of Washington, 1946-64. Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 1979; pg. 17. In 1935 there emerged an organization of liberals and social democratic supporters of the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the Commonwealth Builders. Launched by up-and-coming radio political commentator Howard Costigan the group was expanded at a 1936 convention to form the Washington Commonwealth Federation (WCF), attempting to replicate the growing success of the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation of Canada. Although initially opposed by the Communist Party USA, with the emergence of the Comintern's tactic of the Popular Front ‚Äî mandating efforts by communists around the world to engage in common efforts with liberals and social democrats against the growing global menace of fascism ‚Äî the WCF came to be seen as an ideal target for communist participation and control. Executive Secretary Costigan was won over as a secret member of the Communist Party late in 1936 and communists began dedicated activity in the organization. In 1946, Albert F. Canwell, Republican from Spokane's Fifth District was elected to the Washington House of Representatives. Canwell had personally been concerned with the matter of communism in Washington since a prominent 1934 waterfront strike and he dove into his job with prosecutorial zeal, first obtaining files of people and groups of interest in the state from friendly members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in Washington, DC. His campaign promised to stop tax increases and to fight Communism. He drafted a concurrent resolution to establish a Washington State \\"Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities,\\" modeled on the federal House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and a similar California State committee. The committee would comprise three House members and three Senate members plus Canwell as chairman. Sanders, Cold War on Campus, pg. 21. Members Washington House Speaker Herbert M. Hamblen (1947) appointed Canwell as committee chair The Interim Committee on Un-American Activities of the Washington State Legislature was established on the last day of the 1947 legislative session. On March 8, 1947, Washington State's House Concurrent Resolution No. 10 established the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. House Speaker Herbert M. Hamblen appointed Canwell as chairman. The committee becomes known as the \\"Canwell Committee.\\" The resolution directed the committee to \\"investigate the activities of groups and organizations whose membership includes persons who are Communists, or any other organization known or suspected to be dominated or controlled by a foreign power.\\" Members came from: * Washington State House of Representatives:  Albert F. Canwell (chairman)  Sydney A. Stevens  Grant C. Stisson  George F. Yantis * Washington State Senate:  R.L. Rutter Jr.  Thomas H. Bienz  Harold G. Kimball In practice, five of the committee's seven members were Republicans and only two Democrats. One was a member of the conservative American Legion.Sanders, Cold War on Campus, pp. 21-22. The one liberal Democrat, Representative George F. Yantis, was appointed by House Speaker Hamblen to counterbalance the Republicans, but Yantis died in December 1947 before the committee began to conduct its public hearings. Hearings Howard Rushmore (here, in 1957) named Alger Hiss as a Soviet mole in mid-July 1948, less than three before Whittaker Chambers would testify before HUAC on 3 August 1948 The Canwell Committee held its hearings at the Seattle Armory. On January 27, 1948, the Canwell Committee convenes its first hearing. The subject was subversion within the Washington Pension Union. On July 19, 1948, the Canwell Committee held its second hearings. The subject was subversion within the University of Washington. Witnesses included George Hewitt, who claimed he had taught University of Washington professor Melvin Rader at a \\"highly secret Communist school at Briehl's Farm, near Kingston, New York, for a period of about six weeks in the Summer of 1938 or 1939.\\" Rader later pursued Hewitt for perjury. Canwell also invited anti-communists Howard Rushmore and J. B. Matthews to testify before the committee in Alger Hiss. \\"At this time, no one knew that Alger Hiss would later be accused of being paid by the Soviet government and tried as a traitor.\\" Canwell had come to knew of the September 1939 notes made by Undersecretary of State Adolf Berle during a secretive meeting with Whittaker Chambers shortly after the Hitler-Stalin Pact became public. Rushmore testified for three days through to July 21, during which he noted the arrest of a dozen top Communist Party leaders across the country (leading to the 1949 Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders). Rushmore also claimed that \\"moles\\" existed in the federal government. He named Harold Ware, Lee Pressman, Donald Hiss, John Abt, Charles Kramer, Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, and Joseph P. Lash. Fred Neindorff of the Seattle Post Intelligencer and Ashley Holden of the Spokesman-Review both covered the story; U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall personally called both newspapers to quash the story. During taping for an oral history in 1997, Canwell said, \\"We wished to put the Hiss case in the record, and there‚Äôs testimony by them about atomic scientists and others who were questionable characters.\\" The only scientist whose name Canwell could remember was J. Robert Oppenheimer of the Manhattan Project. \\"There were numerous others,\\" Canwell said, but he would have to go back and read the record to call \\"all their names\\" accurately. Asked to \\"characterize\\" Oppenheimer, Canwell said he agreed with conservative journalist Westbrook Pegler: he paid dues in the Communist Party, he was married to a Communist, and sleeping with at least one other one. Of the two, Rushmore and Matthews, Canwell explained, \\"Rushmore was principally brought out to testify on Hiss and the atomic scientists,\\" while Matthews helped on the subject of universities. Dissolution In November 1948, Canwell lost his re-election; the committee issued its final report in January 1949. In 1997, during oral history interviews, Canwell explained: > One of the reasons that I tried over and over to be elected to Congress was > that I needed the power base to do what I knew needed doing‚Äìwhat I wanted to > do... Nobody paid my way, and that was what I was always confronted with. > That‚Äôs more or less the total Canwell operation‚Äìit‚Äôs a one-man FBI with no > funds. References Further reading * Albert F.

Web. 16 Aug. 2012. . Proposal management software is becoming increasingly popular in companies that manage frequent and extensive proposal writing projects. Such software allows businesses to automate the more routine tasks while easily tracking multiple versions. Proposal software allows users to create and manage all important sales and marketing documentation such as business proposals, welcome letters, contracts, quotes, and marketing collateral. Often available as a web-based cloud service, proposal software helps sales, marketing, and legal teams both administer the proposal creation process and communicate their needs through a digital document. Many software applications integrate with CRM software, content management solutions, accounting platforms, and electronic signature providers. Some integrate with Microsoft Office. Proposal management software is considered to be a sales efficiency tool as it helps cross-selling and upselling by spending less time on creating and managing sales documents and delivering timely and relevant information. In some cases, it‚Äôs argued that this software solution bleeds into an up-and- coming ‚Äúsales enablement‚Äù software genre. However, proposal management software addresses inefficiencies and lack of visibility in the sales cycle, rather than ‚Äúsales enablement‚Äù efforts defined as sales coaching and guiding the sale. Andersen, Kurt. \\"Why Sales Enablement Matters - CRM Magazine.\\" CRM Magazine. N.p., 30 Apr. 2012. Web. 04 Mar. 2013. Forrester Research, a business technology analyst firm, views sales enablement and efficiency tools, such as proposal management software, as the key linchpin required to help a B2B company bridge the gap between their business strategies and how they execute in the field. Santucci, Scott. ‚ÄúWhat Is \\"Sales Enablement\\" And How Did Forrester Go About Defining It?\\" Forrester.com, 14 Aug. 2010. Web. 01 Mar. 2013. Main features The core features of proposal management software vary widely between systems. Many simpler programs have only basic features, while others, especially enterprise systems, are more complex and powerful. Proposal management software is a set of automated processes that may support the following features. * Allow for a large number of people to share and contribute to both stored proposal templates and data; * Control access to proposals based on defined user roles (i.e., define information that users or user groups can view, edit, publish, etc.); * Provides multi-tier approval; * Facilitates storage and retrieval of proposals; * Control over data validity; * Simplify proposal writing; * Improve communication and collaboration among users; * Management of specific sections of a document; * Increased content and brand compliance; * Decrease in time to final assembly; * Track the time spent by various contributors, enabling management to calculate ROI of each document. Data types and usage Proposal software is frequently used for storing, controlling, revising, semantically enriching, and publishing documentation. Serving as a central repository, the proposal software increases the version level of new updates to an already existing file. A standard requirement for salespeople is to have a standard proposal that you can modify to meet the specific requirements of your customer or prospect. Simple cutting and pasting of boilerplate materials can make it easy to create good proposals. The software enables users to assemble individual components into a document structure. Some solutions offer uses a 'shopping cart' experience, where salespeople are able to select which content components to include in the final document. These components are then reused (rather than copied and pasted) within a document or across multiple documents. Data tags and smart content sections allow for automatic tailoring by client name, region or product selection. This ensures that content is consistent across the entire document set. Web-based Software as a service (SaaS) or web- based proposal management software require content to be imported into the system. However, once content is imported, the software acts like a search engine so users can find what they are looking for faster. The HTML format allows for better application of search capabilities such as full-text searching and stemming. =Enterprise system= Enterprise software tend to offer more customized solutions intended to improve the enterprise‚Äôs productivity and sales efficiency by providing advanced functionality, robust business logic, and support functionality.

The wife of Yang Ye and the mother of their 7 sons, she is a prominent figure in the stories on Generals of the Yang Family. The elderly and widowed She Saihua is also commonly known as She Taijun (‰ΩòÂ§™Âêõ; \\"Dowager She\\") and is usually depicted with a dragon-head cane (ÈæçÈ†≠ÊãêÊùñ). She allegedly lived past the age of 100. Legends =Marriage to Yang Ye= She Saihua's father She Hong (‰ΩòÊ¥™) had already arranged for his daughter to marry Yang Ye, but changed his mind and betrothed her to Cui Long (Â¥îÈæç) from the more powerful Cui family instead. When the Yang family requested marriage, She Hong sent for Cui Long to come quickly to marry his daughter. She Saihua did not like the ugly and untalented Cui Long and sent a messenger for Yang Ye. After Yang Ye's arrival and at the request of She Saihua, She Hong had no choice but to declare that the winner of the duel between the suitors would marry his daughter. Yang Ye killed Cui Long in the battle but accidentally injured She Hong who tried to help Cui Long. Angry, She Saihua fought Yang Ye who retreated to the Seven-Star Temple. Inside the temple, Yang Ye clarified the misunderstanding and they married. ‰∫¨ÂâßÂâßÁõÆËÄÉÁï•Ôºö„ÄäÁ¥´ÈáëÂ∏¶„Äã The Seven-Star Temple where they allegedly married is located in today's Fugu County, Shaanxi province. Â∫úÂ∑ûÂüé =Taking command of the army= She Saihua had 7 sons and 2 daughters with Yang Ye, the Song commander-in-chief. With Pan Mei refusing to send aid, Yang Ye and several sons died during the battles of Golden Beach and Mount Twin Wolves. Lady She made sure Pan Mei's crimes did not go unnoticed and successfully prosecuted him in the imperial court. Trusting her loyalty and judgment, Emperor Taizong made her the commander-in-chief and awarded her a Dragon Head Cane, a symbol of the emperor, for absolute control of the male- dominated army. Historical claim While Yang Ye is a real historical character, no historical records mentioned his wife until the Qing Dynasty, which mentioned Yang Ye marrying a Lady She (ÊäòÊ∞è), the daughter of a Later Zhou-turned Song general She Deyi (ÊäòÂæ∑ÊâÜ). While this seems possible considering She Deyi and Yang Ye's age and geography, not all historians are convinced of the claim, especially since the fictitious character with the homonym surname She (‰Ωò) had already appeared back in the Yuan Dynasty and was widely known by Qing Dynasty. http://litera.ccu.edu.tw/journal/article/16_07.pdf „Äå‰ΩòÂ§™Âêõ„ÄçËàá„ÄåÊäòÂ§™Âêõ„ÄçËÄÉ Worship \\"She Taijun Temple\\" (‰ΩòÂ§™ÂêõÂªü) is located in Baiwangshan Forest Park in Haidian District, Beijing, China.

It is commonly regarded as her magnum opus. The novel won the Literaturpreis der Stadt Bremen in 1996. The prologue and epilogue were translated into English by Louise E. Stoehr in 1998,Documentation of translations of Elfriede Jelinek's texts by the Elfriede Jelinek-Research-Center, Vienna: PDF while a full English translation by Gitta Honegger is forthcoming in 2021. Next to Jelinek's novel Neid, The Children of the Dead is her longest work. Although it can be classified as a postmodern horror novel, Jelinek herself calls it a \\"ghost story written in the tradition of the Gothic novel.\\"\\"Gespensterroman in der Tradition der gothic novel\\": Grohotolsky, Ernst (ed.). Provinz sozusagen. Graz: Droschl, 1995, p. 63. The novel constitutes an intensive examination of the memory and suppression of the Holocaust. Along with this goes an associative mode of writing which incorporates plays on words and constantly disrupts linear narration through looping and repeated narrative strands. Plot The novel is unusual amongst literary works in German in that all the characters are undead in the process of decomposition and are presented as mute zombies in the manner of splatter films. Of these undead protagonists, the three primary are Gudrun Bichler, Edgar Gstranz and Karin Frenzel; they are incapable of speech, obsessed with sex, and brutal. They are confronted with the mass of Holocaust victims, who wish to achieve new life by means of the couple, Gudrun and Edgar; however their plan fails since Gudrun and Edgar are likewise undead. The setting dissolves into a sea of mud. Adaptations In 2019, directors Kelly Copper and Pavol Liska collaborated on a feature film adaptation, Die Kinder der Toten, in a comedy horror style.

This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the E-cadherin complex and mediates its ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation in the lysosomes. The encoded protein contains a RING-finger domain and is also thought to have a role in control of cell proliferation.  Function  Hakai functions as a RING finger domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase for E-cadherin. Hakai mediates E-cadherin ubiquitination and its degradation by proteasomes. \\"Hakai\\" means \\"destruction\\" in Japanese. Proteosomal degradation of E-cadherin can be regulated by phosphorylation. The Hakai binding site is a part of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain that contains several tyrosines. Tyrosine kinases such as Src and Met can phosphorylate E-cadherin and enhance Hakai binding to E-cadherin. Two lysines of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain have been shown to be sites for ubiquitination. Hakai also interacts with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor.

Life Originally from Djillakh (Dieghem, in the Sine), he was given the niece of Maysa Wali in marriage after demonstrating his prowess in the wrestling arena. According to oral tradition Maysa Wali, later a Maad a Sinig (king of Sine), was the first member of the Guelowar Dynasty to rule in Sine after his family's defeat by the √ëaancos at the so-called Battle of Troubang in 1335.

His marriage to Lingeer Tening JomVariations : Tening Diom (Following the French spelling of the Serer surname Jom in Senegal) also T√©ning Diome (see : Buschinger, p 60) provided many heirs to the throne of Sine, including his sons Tasse Faye and Waagaan Tening Jom Faye who all succeeded to the throne of Sine as Maad a Sinigs and established the Faye Dynasty in Sine. Other sources suggests that, he was married to Lingeer Siin o Mew Manneh (sister of Maysa Wali, whom the Kingdom of Sine was named after following its renaming in the 14th century), not Tening Jom, and it is from that marriage the Faye Dynasty of Sine derived from.

As one of the Senegambian royal families, many of his descendants went on to shape Senegambian history during these periods.

Although Gil was exiled to Europe by the summer of 1969, the song became a major hit in Brazil, with an extended stay at the top of the charts, and in August 1970 it was awarded the Golden Dolphin (Golphino d'Ouro) prize from the Sound and Image Museum (Museu da Imagem e do Som) in Rio.

In an interview in O Pasquim shortly after his exile, he explained that the song was his way of capturing the joy and happiness he had seen on the streets, which he had not felt for some time--\\"my intention was really, very simply, to give an embrace to the people of Rio...It was a song of encountering, not leaving.\\" In that same interview, Gil also addressed the controversy of whether he had taken the title phrase \\"Aquele Abra√ßo\\" from the popular Rio television personality Lilico.

Adopted from Mara Leveritt's 2002 book of the same name, the film is about the true story of three murdered children, and the three teenagers known as the West Memphis Three who were convicted of killing them, during the Satanic ritual abuse panic. The teenagers were subsequently sentenced to death (Echols) and life imprisonment (Baldwin and Misskelley), before all were released after eighteen years. Produced by Elizabeth Fowler, Richard Saperstein, Clark Peterson, Christopher Woodrow, and Paul Harris Boardman, the film stars Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon, Mireille Enos, Dane DeHaan, Kevin Durand, Bruce Greenwood, Stephen Moyer, Elias Koteas, Amy Ryan, and Alessandro Nivola. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8. It had a limited release in Canadian theaters on January 24, 2014, and was released in U.S. theaters and video on demand services on May 9, 2014. Plot In 1993, in the working class, deeply religious community of West Memphis, Arkansas, three eight-year-old boys ‚Äì Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore ‚Äì go missing from their neighborhood. After an extensive search, their bound and beaten bodies are found the next day. The community and the police department are convinced that the murders are the work of a satanic cult, due to the violent and sexual natures of the crime. A month later, three teenagers ‚Äì Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. ‚Äì are arrested after Misskelley confesses to the murders following 12 hours of interrogation. They are taken to trial, where Baldwin and Misskelley are sentenced to life in prison, and Echols to death, all the while proclaiming their innocence. During the trial, the defense team's investigator, Ron Lax, uncovers evidence suggesting that the police mishandled and suppressed evidence in the case. This evidence includes blood evidence that was lost, a sighting of a never-identified man covered in blood and mud entering a restaurant near the site of the murders on the night the boys were killed, as well as a confession to the murders by a man named Chris Morgan, which may or may not have been coerced. The prosecution's two chief witnesses - a boy who claims in fantastic detail to have seen the murders and been forced to drink the victims' blood, and his mother, who claims to have heard Echolls confess - are found to be compromised. Meanwhile, Pam Hobbs, Stevie's mother, begins to suspect that her husband (and Stevie's stepfather) Terry killed the boy, especially after finding Stevie's prized Swiss Army knife in Terry's toolkit. Lax visits Pam, who expresses doubt about the verdict; Lax replies that, while he does not know who committed the murders, he knows in his heart that his clients are innocent. Soon afterward, Pam leaves her husband. A series of title cards describe the aftermath of the trial: In August 2011, after nearly 20 years in prison, Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley were given a new trial and released after entering an Alford plea, under which they remain convicted felons; the boy and his mother, who testified against the defendants recanted; Lax discovered a hair sample from the crime scene that resembled Terry Hobbs' DNA; the wife of John Mark Byers, the father of one of the victims, was found dead under \\"unsolved\\" circumstances; and Pam Hobbs continued to look for the truth about her son's murder.

It was released on July 10 2012 by Ipecac Recordings, and debuted at number 23 on the American Billboard Classic Albums chart. It received mixed reviews from critics. The album is a recording of the 1965 work of the same name by Italian composer Luciano Berio, and contains lyrics from Edoardo Sanguineti's 1956 poem Laborintus. Berio's composition employs elements of jazz and electronic music. Sanguineti's libretto borrows ideas from the works of Dante Alighieri, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and uses his own original work. Berio named \\"memory, death and usury\\" the work's main concerns, believing these themes to be present in Dante's work. Production Laborintus II is a recording of a 1965 composition by Luciano Berio, written to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Dante Alighieri's birth. The libretto was provided by Edoardo Sanguineti, who included elements of his 1956 poem Laborintus in it. AllMusic's Thom Jurek described the original poem as speaking of \\"the timelessness of love and mourning, while acting as a critique of the commoditization of all things\\". In addition to Sanguineti's own poetry‚Äîitself based on themes found in Dante's Divina Commedia, Convivio and La Vita Nuova‚Äîthe work uses excerpts from the Bible and the writings of poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Musically, Laborintus II incorporates elements of jazz and electronic music while sometimes evoking the style of Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi. Berio described the main structure as a \\"catalogue, in its medieval meaning\\" (exemplified by Isidore of Seville's seventh century encyclopaedia Etymologiae), using Dante's themes of \\"memory, death and usury\\". Members of the Dutch choir Nederlands Kamerkoor, who performed on the recording, have also cited usury as a key theme in the work, describing the composition as \\"an indictment against the practice\\". Of the form, Berio wrote: \\"Individual words and sentences are sometimes to be regarded as autonomous entities, and sometimes to be perceived as part of the sound structure as a whole.\\" The instrumentation for Laborintus II was written as an \\"extension\\" of the vocal material; its electronic section is likewise an extension of the instrumental music. Berio used car tyres and a blow-up doll on stage in a performance of the work at the Holland Festival in 1973. The album was recorded live at the Holland Festival on June 18, 2010, in the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ. The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Lo√Øc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player G√©ry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise. Patton has said of the work, \\"I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized ... Maybe because of the language barrier, maybe because it‚Äôs not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when he wrote this piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice\\". Composition Laborintus II combines orchestral, choral and spoken elements throughout its three parts. Patton's narration is spoken in Italian, although taped samples feature Sanguineti speaking in English. Patton uses a range of vocal techniques‚Äîincluding whispering, singing and shouting‚Äîas the work progresses. The choral parts respond to the narration both with unified chanting and with disjointed arguing; the overall effect is one of \\"dramatic tension\\". They are accompanied by three female vocalists whose voices range from soprano singing to \\"cooing\\" and \\"howling\\". The music incorporates elements of jazz and 20th-century avant-garde. The orchestra's instruments frequently interrupt both each other and the female voices; some sections of the composition seem as though they are improvised. Laborintus II makes use of both traditional percussion instruments and electronic sounds, and their interplay serves to \\"erect musical and textural architectures, then disassemble them quickly\\". Critic Max Feldman has compared the style to that of Raymond Scott. The first part of the composition features the three female voices creating a \\"mournful\\" tone while the orchestra plays recurring musical passages. The second part is a discordant crescendo, as Patton's narration becomes increasingly shouted and the orchestral accompaniment more \\"hyperactive\\". The third and final part returns to a calmer tone, focusing on drums and jazz woodwind instruments. Release and reception Laborintus II was released on July 10, 2012, through Patton's record label Ipecac Recordings. In the United States, the album debuted and spent one week on the Billboard Classic Albums chart at number 23. The album was not well received by critics. Review aggregation website Metacritic awarded it an average score of 58 out of 100, based on eight reviews; this indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\" by their metric. For the most part, reviewers have considered the album to be challenging and difficult, with some believing it to be an acquired taste after repeated listens and others deeming it impenetrable. The A.V. Club considered the recording to be \\"challenging, uncompromising, and bordering on inaccessible\\", but credited it with \\"hidden payoffs\\" to reward repeated hearings, including \\"haunting\\" and \\"wraithlike\\" arrangements. Sputnik Music echoed this view but described the album as \\"fascinating if not unwieldy\\", and the composition itself as \\"somber, beautiful, and ominous, but always affecting\\"; they felt that Laborintus II was perhaps Patton's most ambitious album to date, but noted that the musician has previously produced similarly avant-garde records in the past. AllMusic‚Äîwhile highlighting that Laborintus II was difficult to grasp at first, by virtue of being a recording of theatrical music‚Äîdescribed the recording as \\"a very nearly dazzling endeavor that rewards patience mightily\\". Consequence of Sounds called it \\"unlike anything else you‚Äôve ever heard\\", noting the music might need more than one hearing to appreciate it, and that it \\"runs the gauntlet from quiet, jazzy atmospherics to brazen, unsettling primal noise\\". A review for PopMatters stressed the \\"challenging\\" and \\"exhausting\\" nature of Berio's composition, adding that the music \\"constantly emphasises its own unpredictability\\". It compared the album to the 1970 Miles Davis free jazz album Bitches Brew. Spin magazine's review described it as being \\"narrated by a rock star prone to screaming\\", while a reviewer for Q magazine called it \\"both disorienting and immensely tedious\\". The complex nature of the piece was summed up by Magnet magazine, whose reviewer felt that it was \\"hard not to respect Patton's creative adventurousness, but sweet Jesus, the gulf between admiration and enjoyment of one of his projects has never been so wide\\". Ictus Ensemble's performance was singled out for praise by AllMusic, writing of their \\"bracing freshness and mischievous glee\\". Likewise Patton's voice frequently attracted comments by critics who variously described it as \\"grim, medieval, almost priestly\\", \\"alternately authoritative and declarative, reflective, romantic, priestly, and nearly apocalyptic\\", and \\"a unique tool that he can shape into whatever he needs it to be\\".

History The company was established by J√∂rgen Philip- S√∂rensen, as a division of Securitas AB in 1968. The name derives from the fact that it brought together four different British security businesses into a single entity which became known as Group 4 Total Security and which was demerged from Securitas AB in 1981. Following the decision by the British Government in 1993 to enter into a contract with Group 4 to provide security for prisons, the company was embarrassed after a series of security blunders, including escaped prisoners. It merged with Falck, a Danish security business, in June 2000 to form Group 4 Falck. Controversies =1993 prisoner escapes in the United Kingdom= In April 1993, Group 4 held what was described by the Independent as a \\"carefully stage-managed press conference\\" to resolve public relations problems after four prisoners were lost in the first seven days of their contract to transport prisoners. Shortly after the press conference it was revealed a further two had been lost. The Campsfield House detention facility, which was near Oxford, had seen hunger strikes and rioting that resulted in a mass escape over the perimeter fence shortly after it opened in 1993. Just one year after then-Labour home affairs spokesperson Tony Blair declared that a \\"comedy of errors\\" was occurring within Group 4, a hunger striker who had been admitted to hospital from the Campsfield House detention centre managed to escape while being transported by Group 4 security officers. The centre suffered further controversy in 1998, when prisoner John Quahquah and eight others were acquitted of charges of rioting and disorder after it was proved that evidence provided by staff was false and unreliable; the centre was shut by David Blunkett in 2002. In March 2000, six Romanian immigrants absconded from Oakington Immigration Reception Centre, then run by Group 4. Twelve asylum seekers absconded from the same centre in 2003 by scaling the perimeter fence and vanishing into the night. Three prisoners also escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 after attacking Group 4 security officers and locking them in a cell and later on that year a vehicle transferring prisoners from Cambridge to Bedford prison crashed, resulting in the escape of 20-year-old Rodney Buckley.

Gilding, a former executive director of Greenpeace International, and a Fellow at University of Cambridge's Institute for Sustainability Leadership,Fellows of the University of Cambridge‚Äôs Institute for Sustainability Leadership is the author of The Great Disruption: Why the Climate Crisis Will Bring On the End of Shopping and the Birth of a New World (2011). In 2012, Gilding delivered a presentation on the thesis of his book at the 2012 TED conference titled The Earth is Full, which earned him press attention. He lives in southern Tasmania with his wife and children. Career Gilding started his career as an activist in his early teens, focusing on South African apartheid and Aboriginal land rights. While serving in the Australian Air Force, he also became involved in the nuclear disarmament movement. According to an interview on AlterNet, Gilding's experience in anti-nuclear politics led to a greater awareness of environmental issues and led him to join Greenpeace in the 1980s, becoming involved in direct actions against corporate polluters.System Failure: We Are Approaching the End of Society As We Know It -- And That May Be a Good Thing, AlterNet, 21 June 2012. Between 1989 and 1994, Gilding served as the executive director of Greenpeace Australia and, later, Greenpeace International. Gilding serves on the advisory board of The Climate Mobilization, a grassroots advocacy group calling for a global economic mobilization against climate change on the scale of the American home front during World War II, with the goal of 100% clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The Great Disruption In The Great Disruption, Gilding posits that the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 is a symptom of human civilization growing beyond Earth's ability to support it, and is tied to the threat posed by climate change and other forms of environmental degradation. Because of this, Gilding calls for an end to the whole concept of exponential economic growth, which he blames for the consumption and waste that has led to both the economic and ecological crises facing mankind and modern civilization. Furthermore, in a departure from many environmental writers ‚Äî such as James Lovelock, Clive Hamilton, Richard Heinberg and James Howard Kunstler ‚Äî Gilding argues that people will work together through the climate crisis and that humanity as a whole will eventually act in time to save civilization, albeit too late to prevent catastrophic consequences; Gilding bases this argument on the ingenuity of past generations in the midst of crisis, particularly World War II. Gilding also believes that the global economy will fully embrace sustainable energy when societies fully accept the reality of climate change and abandon fossil fuel resources.

The act was a result of a government review of the law related to the inviolability of diplomatic premises following the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege. The law has only been used once, for the Cambodian embassy in London, which had been occupied by squatters. The embassy had been used by the Government of Cambodia before it was overthrown by Pol Pot in 1975. Whilst that government was recognised by Britain, no diplomatic mission was established before Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam in 1978, and the building came into the care of the British Foreign Office. The squatters moved in whilst the embassy was vacant in 1976, and in 1988 they would have gained title to the building following twelve years of continuous occupation. Hence an order was made, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises (Cambodia) Order 1988, to de-recognise the diplomatic premises so that legal action could be taken to remove the squatters.R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Samuel.

It is headed by the ambassador of Ecuador to the United Kingdom. It is located in the Knightsbridge area of London, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It is in an apartment building which also houses the Embassy of Colombia as well as a number of residential apartments, near Harrods, Hyde Park, and Hans Place, at 3 Hans Crescent at the intersection with Basil Street, and it is close to Knightsbridge Underground station. For almost seven years the embassy was famously home to the Australian activist and journalist Julian Assange, who initially entered on 19 June 2012 claiming diplomatic asylum, which was granted by the Ecuadorian government on 16 August 2012. He had absconded in breach of bail after dismissal of his appeal by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.Declaraci√≥n del Gobierno de la Rep√∫blica del Ecuador sobre la solicitud de asilo de Julian Assange  Functions The embassy is charged with representing the interests of the president and government of Ecuador, improving diplomatic relations between Ecuador and the accredited countries, promoting and improving the image and standing of Ecuador in the accredited nations, promoting the culture of Ecuador, encouraging and facilitating tourism to and from Ecuador, and ensuring the safety of Ecuadorians abroad. The structure that houses the embassy is a white stucco-fronted red-brick building on Hans Crescent in the Knightsbridge area of London. The embassy is a suite of rooms occupying part of the ground floor of the building, which is an apartment block. Ecuador also maintains a consulate at 144-146 Kings Cross Road, London WC1X 9DU and an Office of the Naval Assistant and Permanent Representative to the International Maritime Organization at 61 Wimbledon Hill Road, Wimbledon, London.  Julian Assange's refuge  Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in August 2012 The co-founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was a resident of the embassy for seven years after entering it on 19 June 2012 to claim diplomatic asylum after being wanted by Swedish authorities for questioning over four alleged sexual offences. Assange's asylum request was eventually granted by the Ecuadorian government in August 2012. The Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in May 2017, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. The British government had suggested it could use its discretionary powers under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to enter the embassy and arrest Assange after giving the embassy due notice. However, it later retracted the suggestion, following condemnation from Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati√±o and President Rafael Correa. Pati√±o described the British government's statement as \\"a clear breach of international law and the protocols set out in the Vienna Convention.\\" Press outside the embassy in August 2012 On 16 August 2012, police and protesters gathered outside the embassy, with reports of minor scuffles between the two groups and arrests of some of the protesters. On 19 August 2012, Assange made a speech from a low balcony of the embassy. Assange's remarks were prefaced by a statement from Baltasar Garz√≥n, who is heading his legal team. This was followed by protests in Ecuador outside the British embassy in Quito, as well as support for Correa's approval of the asylum request. On 22 August 2012, the Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa stated that Assange would be allowed to stay in the embassy indefinitely, but that Ecuador would be open to negotiations with the British government if it withdrew its threats to storm the embassy. In August 2014, Assange called a press conference and announced he would be leaving the embassy \\"soon\\". Press photographs taken outside the embassy were reported to have shown police notes stating that Assange was to be arrested \\"under all circumstances\\". The policing of the embassy during the first two years of Assange's stay reportedly cost ¬£6.5 million. Before the police guard was lifted in February 2015, costs of policing Assange had reached ¬£10 million. The Guardian revealed in May 2018 that Ecuador had employed an international security company for more than five years to monitor Assange's visitors. On 3 April 2019, WikiLeaks claimed that the Ecuadorian embassy would expel Assange within a few hours or days but Jose Valencia, Foreign Minister of Ecuador called it a rumour. Two days later the statements of Assange's departure came after the Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno accused Assange of repeatedly violating the terms of asylum. On 11 April 2019, Assange was arrested by British authorities who were invited into the embassy by the Ecuadorian government.

The game was released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and DOS systems. The game was also released in Japan on the Saturn. The game's cover features former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino. Gameplay NFL Quarterback Club 97 optimizes the use of the kicking meter, as well as overhead camera angles, which are customizable. The game also has Custom Simulation modes, which save up to five game situations for players that cannot finish a game in time. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre designed various plays that are available in the game. There are five possible game modes (Preseason, Regular Season, Pro Bowl, Playoff, and Super Bowl). Players can also recreate historic game situations. There is no announcer on the PlayStation version. Reception The game received mixed to negative reviews. Reviewing the PlayStation version, the two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly both regarded it as a disappointment, though for different reasons: Dindo Perez said the graphics are substandard, while Todd Mowatt said the graphics are vastly improved from the previous Quarterback Club but the AI is too easy to beat by a wide margin. IGN simply commented that the game is slow and the graphics are weak, it is not better than competitor Madden NFL 97, and players should wait for NFL Quarterback Club '98. GamePros Johnny Ballgame also compared it unfavorably to Madden NFL 97. He said that while it is solid in terms of gameplay and features, the graphics, though better on the PlayStation than on any other version, suffer from choppy scrolling and animation which make it difficult to follow the ball carrier. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot said that the players are slow, the weather options are poor, and penalties are unrealistic. CNET criticized the poor sound, graphics, lack of transactions (except for trades), and stated that every team has the same playbook. CNET also stated that game scores can peak into the 100s, and that players cannot get tired nor injured. Reviews for the Saturn version were similar. Dr. Zombie wrote in GamePro that \\"NFL Quarterback Club '97 reports to camp with notable graphical and gameplay improvements over its rookie outing.\\" However, similarly to IGN he found the game was outdone by the Saturn version of Madden NFL '97, which was being released at the same time and featured smoother graphics and responsive commentary. A reviewer for Next Generation likewise said the game is a huge improvement over the previous installment but still clearly inferior to Madden NFL '97, and additionally criticized that the Saturn version's colors are less bright than the PlayStation version's. However, he did say that the tackling mechanics are remarkably innovative and expressed hope that they would be imitated by other football games. Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine said the game is well-done in some respects, particularly the selection of plays and the ability to replay or create new situations, but \\"is out-gunned, out-quaffed and basically out-done in every way by EA's Madden '97\\" due to the below-average sprite scaling and animation, lack of PAL optimization, and unintuitive controls.

It was launched with 2 Gonets-M civilian communication satellites and a research satellite called Yubileiny-2, also known as MiR. Launch Kosmos 2481 was launched from Site 133/3 at Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. It was launched by a Rockot carrier rocket with a Briz-KM upper stage at 01:35 UTC on 28 July 2012. The launch successfully placed the satellite into low earth orbit. It subsequently received its Kosmos designation, and the international designator 2012-041A. The United States Space Command assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 38733. The Russian military announced that the rocket was under control of the Titov Main Test and Space Systems Control Centre at 01:38 UTC and the satellites were released from the rocket at 03:19 UTC. It was the first launch of a Rockot since February 2011 when a satellite was placed in the wrong orbit due to a problem with the upper stage. Ground track of Kosmos 2481 Strela-3 Kosmos 2481 is a Strela-3 satellite. They are described as store-dump communications satellites which receive information from the ground when they pass overhead, and store that information until they pass over the ground station they deliver the information to. The satellites are in low earth orbit going round the earth every 116 minutes. A full deployment of Strela-3 craft should consist of twelve satellites. The satellite has the GRAU index 17F13, showing it is a Strela-3, not a Strela-3M (also called Rodnik) as they have a GRAU index of 17F132. Strela-3 has a civilian variant called Gonets which is used by the Russian government for communication in remote areas. It can take between two minutes and six hours to deliver messages. The previous satellites of this class, Kosmos 2467 and Kosmos 2468, were launched together on 8 September 2010.

Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs and map. William Wilson donated along Deer Creek for the town. The Indian mill sites located along the Creek made this a valuable site. Samuel Milroy lead the effort to make Delphi the county seat in May 1828. The nearby swamps meant that malaria, as endemic and the town grew slowly.Carroll County, Interim Report,; Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory; Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana The first permanent settler on record was Henry Robinson. With help from his family, the first log cabin was erected January 8, 1825, just south of Deer Creek on what is now known as \\"the hill\\" (later referred to as Robinson's hill). Daniel Baum and family also established their cabin on \\"Robinson's hill\\" where they started the first tavern \\"inn\\" that was frequented by settlers that passed through via the Indiana trail, which crossed Deer Creek just below their cabin. The Wabash River, located north and west of Delphi, provided an excellent travel route for early settlers. Thus Delphi received its initial thrust under leadership when French Canadian traders from the north and settlers from Ohio and Kentucky came to this area to obtain possession of land and trade on the Wabash River. Ephraim Chamberlain purchased the first land in this township on February 17, 1824. In 1826, Wabash and Erie Canal opened trade to the east and southwest. The town experienced new growth. With the advent of rail transportation, the canal was put out of business with the boat in 1850, lost when the aqueduct over Deer Creek collapsed. The railroad arrived in Delphi in 1856. The railroad systems, which passed through Delphi, were the Norfolk and Western, Monon, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The Fort Wayne- Wabash traction interurban line passed through Delphi in 1904. The interurban end when the motorbus was introduced. Significant buildings All structures are historically contributing towards the Historic District Status, unless otherwise noted. An ‚ÄòO‚Äô rating signifies that the structure had enough historic or architectural significance to be considered for individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The ‚ÄòN‚Äô rating signifies that the structure is above average and may, with further investigation be eligible for an individual listing. The ‚ÄòR‚Äô or contributing rating signifies that the structure meet the basic inventory qualifications, but fails to meet individual merit, but in combination with other closely placed similar structures warrants inclusion in an historic district.

Ross, I. M. and Fahroo, F., ‚ÄúA Unified Framework for Real-Time Optimal Control,‚Äù Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Maui, HI, December, 2003. The method combines the concept of differential flatness with pseudospectral optimal control to generate outputs in the so-called flat space.

Concept Because the differentiation matrix, D , in a pseudospectral method is square, higher-order derivatives of any polynomial, y , can be obtained by powers of D , : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot y &= D Y  \\\\ddot y & = D^2 Y  &{} \\\\ \\\\vdots  y^{(\\\\beta)} &= D^\\\\beta Y \\\\end{align} where Y is the pseudospectral variable and \\\\beta is a finite positive integer. By differential flatness, there exists functions a and b such that the state and control variables can be written as, : \\\\begin{align} x & = a(y, \\\\dot y, \\\\ldots, y^{(\\\\beta)})  u & = b(y, \\\\dot y, \\\\ldots, y^{(\\\\beta + 1)}) \\\\end{align} The combination of these concepts generates the flat pseudospectral method; that is, x and u are written as, : x = a(Y, D Y, \\\\ldots, D^\\\\beta Y) : u = b(Y, D Y, \\\\ldots, D^{\\\\beta + 1}Y) Thus, an optimal control problem can be quickly and easily transformed to a problem with just the Y pseudospectral variable.

It was initially detected in 2010 using the Sunyaev‚ÄìZel'dovich effect by the South Pole Telescope collaboration. It is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known, with the mass on the order of 2 . Most of the mass of the Phoenix Cluster is in the form of dark matter and its intracluster medium. The vast stellar halo of the Phoenix Cluster central galaxy extends to over 1.1 million light years from the center, making it one of the largest galaxies known. It is 22 times the diameter of our galaxy, and its starburst activity suggests that the galaxy is still growing larger. The Phoenix Cluster is also producing more X-rays than any other known massive cluster. Central galaxy The central elliptical cD galaxy of this cluster hosts an active galactic nucleus, which is powered by a central supermassive black hole. The central black hole has an estimated mass on the order of 20 billion . This makes it one of the most massive black holes known in the universe, 5,000 times the mass of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. The diameter of the black hole's immense event horizon is on the order of 118 billion kilometers, 19 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto, and has the mass equivalent to that of two dwarf galaxies. The central black hole is devouring matter and growing at a rate of 60 every year. The galaxy contains vast amounts of hot gas. More normal matter is present there than the total of all the other galaxies in the cluster. Data from observations indicate that hot gas is cooling in the central regions at a rate of 3,820 solar masses per year, the highest ever recorded. It is also undergoing a massive starburst, the highest recorded in the middle of a galaxy cluster, although other galaxies at higher redshifts have a higher starburst rate.

It was serialized in Feel Young magazine from 1995 to 1996 and collected into a single tank≈çbon volume by Shodensha on April 8, 2003. The story was adapted into a 2012 live-action film directed by Mika Ninagawa and starring Erika Sawajiri. The manga was released in English by Vertical in 2013. Plot Supermodel has undergone full body plastic surgery to attain the perfect body and face in order to stay on top of the modeling world. However, her body begins to break down as an effect of the treatments and she grows desperate and unhinged, lashing out at first to her manager, Hiroko Tada (alias Mom) and agency and later to the public as she realizes that her current lifestyle cannot last long. The matter is made worse when Tada introduces Liliko to Kozue Yoshikawa whose natural beauty and friendly demeanor makes her a popular fashion icon to women all around. The process of her popularity makes Liliko more unhinged and fearful that she will fade to obscurity. In an attempt to stay ahead, Liliko forces her overly stressed out assistant, Michiko Hada, and her boyfriend to sabotage Kozue. Meanwhile, an inspector investigating a series of mysterious suicides and organ theft believes that Liliko and her unnatural beauty may be the key to unearthing an underground industry of unsafe medical practice and save lives. Spending time with her less attractive younger sister, Chiharu, the inspector is given a photo of what she used to look like. He is able to meet with Liliko with a warning that she may not be able to keep hiding behind her unnatural beauty forever. Eventually Liliko meets with Chiharu discussing her problems at school. Liliko selfishly suggests that her sister lose weight by getting a full body makeover with plastic surgery done to her. This makes Chiharu uncomfortable about it and makes her realize that the Liliko she once remembered is gone. She meets with the inspector again who sympathetically suggests she goes for a more natural approach by exercising and eating healthier. Tada talks to Kozue in what she wants to do five years and if she plans to keep modeling. To her surprise, Kozue admits that she actually looks forward to having a normal, obscure life and doesn't really care if anyone remembers her or not. Later on, Tada has a talk with the makeup artist who had long worked for her agency and Kozue learns Liliko's dark secret in having plastic surgery. Although she doesn't say anything about it, trouble is on the horizon. After losing her job and her boyfriend ending their relationship, Hada had enough of Liliko's manipulation and cruelty towards her. Out of spite and revenge, she sends every information of Liliko's dirty secrets to tabloid magazines everywhere. Hada's exposure brings trouble to Liliko, Tada's modeling agency, and the hospital. Soon everyone starts spurning Liliko by deriding her as a fake for her actions against her assistant, sabotage against Kozue and hiding what she used to look like underneath her fake body. Despite Tada's best efforts, upon realizing how much no one loves her, Liliko decides to destroy herself during a press conference. She seemingly disappears from the spotlight after that. Five years later, Kozue is now the top supermodel and the hospital has been further investigated. Tada's agency has shut down as the result of losing her models to the controversy surrounding her involvement with the hospital. The investigator has been transferred to another department where he encounters Chiharu who is more attractive as the result of both losing weight and corrective surgery. While partying with her makeup artist and friends after a photo shoot in Mexico, Kozue spies Tada for a moment before disappearing. Later, she celebrates the end of the shoot by going to a club notable for its \\"strange shows\\" and sees Liliko about to perform, wearing an eyepatch over her left eye.

Reviewing Helter Skelter, Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the manga an overall A‚àí grade. She believes Okazaki implies that the readers are \\"implicit in the creation of Lilikos with our craving for unattainable beauty in the media.\\" She noted that some people will find the story difficult to stomach and the artwork \\"harsh,\\" although the latter helps the story.

Established in 1857, it is a contributing property of the Saint James District, which is primarily in the vicinity of New York State Route 25A in St. James, although the store is located northwest of Route 25A. History In the early-1840s Ebenezer Smith, a descendant of Town of Smithtown founder Richard \\"Bull\\" Smith sought adventure on a trading expedition west of the Mississippi River Valley with both white settlers and Native Americans. Upon hearing about the California Gold Rush, Smith headed further west in an attempt to expand his fortune. Returning to Long Island with some level of success, Smith built the General Store in 1857. Much of the community was centered around the vicinity of the store at the time. The majority of customers consisted of local farmers and sailors who depended on the general store for their goods and services. The store also served as the local post office, and in the late-19th Century was the home of the hamlet's first telephone. When the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad, an LIRR subsidiary built Saint James Railroad Station further south, there was some concern it would lead to land speculators and rampant suburban sprawl. This never took place, and instead attracted various celebrities to the community, as well as to the store. The old store ledgers have been said to contain such names as silent film actor and playwright Willie Collier, former New York City Mayor William Jay Gaynor, architect Stanford White, Frank McNish, Lionel Barrymore, Virginia Lee and Joe Flynn. Later these early stars and personalities were followed by others such as Ethel and John Barrymore, Lillian Russell, Maud Adams, Buster Keaton, Myrna Loy, Ruth Roman, Irving Berlin and Heavyweight Champion James J. Corbett. At the turn of the century, the store was inherited by Ebenezer's son Everett. Everett Smith died in 1940, and the store was taken over by his father-in-law Karl Ericson, who continued to operate it until he was 90 years old. Preservation efforts Despite the suburbanization of much of Long Island, the store has remained functional. In 1959, Louise and Andrew Havrisko kept it open and prevented it from becoming a local residence, determined to maintain the historical nature of the store. Structurally unchanged since 1894, it was arranged to represent the period between 1880 and 1910, and that atmosphere has generally remained intact since. In 1973, it became one of a number of contributing properties to the Saint James Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1980 it was bought by another couple named John and Eleanor Oakley, and by 1990 it was purchased by the Suffolk County Department of Parks, and dedicated to the Suffolk County Historical Trust. Today, as it has done during the second half of the 20th century, the store has sold various late-Victorian-era artifacts. The second floor contains old books and children's toys related to Long Island history.

His work can be found in the collections of the Mexican Engraving and Print Museum in Bulgaria, the Alfredo Guati Rojo National Watercolor Museum, the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo in Morelia and the Museo Amecatlel in Mexico City. He has also exhibited at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, of which he is a member. His work is a combination of free forms with elements which are done realistically in detail. His idea is to deepen the psyche of man, depicting both the negative and positive aspects of humanity in his art. His work often employed rough textured materials with dark, rich colors to indicate negativity and light, shiny colors on smooth surfaces to indicate the positive aspects of humanity. The main figures of his work are generally realistic with detail, especially his depictions of the female body which represent creation. However, there are elements of Expressionism in his work. Backgrounds are generally chaotic with abstractions, with shadows and light and broken faces, which the painter has called ‚Äúpsiquismo‚Äù (lit. psychism). Notable examples of this include El se√±or de las flores, Enigma, Lo que es arriba, a veces, no es abajo, La psiquis 28, Luces y sombras, Rostro de los 3 reinos No. 1 and Hombre apocal√≠ptico de tierra, vegetal, animal de sentimientos y muerte.

He was also awarded an honorary doctorate (D.Litt) from the Karnataka State Open University. Teltumbde was an executive at Bharat Petroleum and managing director of Petronet India Limited before becoming an academic. He was a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur and later became a senior professor at the Goa Institute of Management. He contributes a column titled \\"Margin Speak\\" to Economic and Political Weekly, and has also contributed to Outlook, Tehelka, and Seminar. Litigation On 29 August 2018, the police raided Teltumbde's home, accusing him of having a connection to the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence and an alleged Maoist plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Teltumbde denied the allegations but his petition was denied by the Bombay High Court. He was granted interim protection from arrest by the High Court, but he was arrested by the Pune police on 3 February 2019 and released later that day. After his release, Teltumbde accused the government of harassment and of attempting to criminalize dissent. In the course of the investigation, various others have been critical of the handling of the case; Supreme Court Justice D Y Chandrachud in September 2018, questioned the biased nature of the investigation by the Maharashtra Police. Others such as counter- terrorism expert and Executive Director of the Institute for Conflict Management, Ajai Sahni suggested the evidence used against Teltumbde seemed fabricated. Teltumbde's mobile phone was hacked by Israeli spyware Pegasus through WhatsApp along with over a dozen other activists, lawyers, and journalists in India. Teltumbe had noticed his phone had been \\"acting up\\" and was later contacted by Citizen Lab in October 2019. In February 2019, The Washington Post reported that Teltumbe was arrested as part of \\"a government crackdown on lawyers and activists\\" who are critics of Modi. More than 600 scholars and academics issued a joint statement in support of Teltumbde, condemning the government's actions as a \\"witch-hunt\\" and demanding an immediate halt to the actions against Teltumbde. In addition, over 150 organizations and intellectuals‚Äîincluding Noam Chomsky and Cornel West‚Äîsigned a letter to United Nations secretary general Ant√≥nio Guterres, describing the charges as \\"fabricated\\" and calling for the UN to intervene. On 16 March 2020, the Supreme Court dismissed Teltumbde's plea for anticipatory bail under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Court gave Teltumbde and Navlakha three weeks to surrender. On 8 April, a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra ordered Teltumbde to surrender to the National Investigation Agency on 14 April. Historians like Romila Thapar condemned the arrest while Amnesty International India expressed its disappointment in light of the UNHCHR guidelines to release all political prisoners due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

Brown (sometimes credited as Oliver Brown) is an American percussionist. Brown was one of the original members of KC & The Sunshine Band. For over 4 decades, Brown has played with well-known performers from Natalie Cole to Jermaine Jackson.  Early years and KC & The Sunshine Band  Brown‚Äôs first big break came in Florida with TK Records as their in house percussionist. He recorded and/or toured with most of their artists, including Benny Latimore, Little Beaver, Clarence Reid, Betty Wright, Gwen McCrae, and George McCrae. Following this, he became one of the original members of KC and The Sunshine Band as they recorded their 1974 debut album Do It Good, followed by the album KC and the Sunshine Band which featured \\"Get Down Tonight\\" and \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\", their first number one hits on the Billboard charts.  Late 1970s & early 1980s  After moving to Los Angeles, California, Brown expanded his musical horizons with the aid of his brother, Eddie Brown of the famed folk duet of the sixties, Joe and Eddie. Eddie Brown arranged his first recording session in L.A. with Gene McDaniels who recorded the 1960s hit, \\"A Hundred Pounds of Clay\\". Gene was producing Nancy Wilson at the time, so Eddie told Gene of Oliver Brown‚Äôs credits with KC and The Sunshine Band, who were then featured on the cover of Cashbox magazine. Gene then invited Brown to the studio to meet him where to his surprise in the studio were sitting: George Duke on keyboards, Ron Carter on Bass, and Steve Gadd on drums. His knees began to knock, at the prospect of being thrown cold into a session with some of the world‚Äôs finest musicians. But, to his relief, Gene had planned to have him do an overdub the next day. He successfully completed the recording session and earned his credits on Nancy Wilson‚Äôs album, This Mother‚Äôs Daughter. This opened the door for more recording and touring with such artists as Jermaine Jackson, The Whispers, Larry Vann, Billy Preston, Leo Sayer, Al Jarreau, Natalie Cole, Thelma Houston, saxophonist Cal Bennett, John Stewart, Doug Mcleod, The Beach Boys, Ron Thompson, Chris Bennett, Nils, Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood‚Äôs Blue Whale Blues Band and many other Warner Brothers, Capitol Records and Motown Recording artists.  Gravity 180  Eventually, Brown became the third member of the trio, Gravity 180, which he considers to be his greatest artistic achievement to date. The other members of the trio are: Clydene Jackson on keyboards with phenomenal vocals, and Harold Payne on acoustic guitar with superb vocals. Payne and Jackson are the main songwriters for the group. Brown has stated that the group has given him the opportunity to express percussion in a way that could be said to be a percussionist‚Äôs dream. Gravity 180 was conceived without the aid of trap drums or a bass player; Jackson plays left hand keyboard bass. This gave Brown the opportunity to cover all the territory of trap drums and percussion in the arrangements of their music (driven by percussion).  Nils  Nils is a Billboard #1 Smooth Jazz artist. Brown performed on all of Nils' albums from his hit \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" to his current album titled, \\"City Groove\\". Brown continues to perform with Nils and Gravity 180 as well as with other prominent artists around the globe.  Film  Brown was featured in Gravity 180, the 2012 documentary film about the group, written, directed, co-produced and edited by two-time award-winning filmmaker Len Rosen. The film was a featured documentary at the Monaco Film Festival in May 2012, and was granted an Honorary award.

She made her appearance as Avery on July 27, 2011, as a high-class attorney. Avery first came to Genoa City after being hired by Victor Newman to be Sharon Newman's lawyer during the character's murder case. She was later revealed to be the estranged sister of Phyllis Summers. Her storylines have predominantly included her legal work, feuding with Phyllis, a romance with Phyllis' ex- husband Nicholas Newman and a history with Dylan McAvoy. Collins left the series on July 21, 2015.  Casting  In June 2011, it was announced that former Loving actress Jessica Collins had been cast in the role of Avery. Collins was previously also known for her roles in television shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210 and American Dreams and guest appearances on Two and a Half Men, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Nip/Tuck. Speaking of her casting, Collins said that \\"I always open to returning to daytime\\" but it \\"had to be for the right role\\". She explained: \\"This one happened really quickly. Y&R; called me and I read the part and I was interested in the character immediately. The timing was right. I felt this was a good fit for me.\\" There were circulating rumors that Collins' character could be related to a previous character, Matt Clark, who had been portrayed by actors Eddie Cibrian and Rick Hearst. Speaking of the rumor, Collins stated: \\"That‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard of that. I don‚Äôt know much Eddie and I look alike but that‚Äôs never stopped anything in daytime\\". In May 2015, Soap Opera Digest reported that Collins was leaving the show, with Avery's last appearance on July 21, 2015.  Development  = Characterization = Prior to her debut on the series, it was revealed by soap journalist Michael Fairman that she was a \\"high-powered attorney who will represent the accused murderess Sharon Newman. Who hires Avery? The Mustache! (And we know how much he likes hot blondes!)\\". The character is a famous attorney; known for defending the wrongly accused. On whether Avery could get Sharon's (Sharon Case) guilty verdict reversed, Collins said that these types of cases are what \\"Avery lives for\\". Collins said \\"She's dedicated her life to righting the wrongs of the system. She's started up an Innocence Project. She's not in it for the money.\\" Describing the character, she said that she isn't a \\"glamorous lawyer\\", but more on the \\"clunky side\\". Additionally, the actress describes her \\"more as a 'broad' than a lady.\\" In October 2012, after over a year on the series, Avery's residence was shown. The apartment designed by the show's production designer Bill Hultstrom was an \\"eclectic\\" home which was made to reflect Collin's real-life background as a professional gourmet chef. In the apartment, Collins stated that Avery mostly \\"cooks and fantasizes\\". Avery in her apartment unveiled a different side to the character; Collins said she enjoyed playing the \\"awkward, goofy, fun side\\" of Avery who is usually so \\"serious in her business life\\". Luke Kerr of Zap2It described Avery as a \\"cupcake-baking, legal eagle\\". Michael Logan of TV Guide called her a \\"Julia Child wannabe\\". = Family and relationships = Upon her debut, CBS Soaps In Depth stated that \\"Any familial dynamics Avery may ‚Äì or may not ‚Äì have will unfold over time.\\" In a twist, it was revealed that she was the younger sister of Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford). They have a bitter relationship towards one another because of Phyllis leaving her as a child. A few months into Avery's reunion with Phyllis, their dying father George Summers (Ken Howard) is introduced to the series. While interviewing Stafford, soap opera journalist Michael Fairman noted: \\"All of a sudden members of Phyllis‚Äôs family are sprouting up. First up was her sister Avery. And now with this recent storyline, Y&R; is bringing back up the sins of the father, with Phyllis and Avery‚Äôs dad George, in the picture for just a brief time.\\" Of Phyllis and Avery's relationship, Stafford said that Collins and herself are still \\"working it out\\", calling it an \\"interesting\\" relationship. She said \\"we wanted to make it a very complex and odd relationship, and even the scenes where we are at the facility with the dad at the end of the story arc are really interesting. What I like about those scenes, and how they play out, is that nothing has been resolved.\\" Stafford said she enjoyed working with Collins, \\"Jessica is amazing. She is so professional and so great. She is so willing to work scenes out.\\" Additionally, Stafford said that Phyllis is jealous of Avery being a successful attorney while she had \\"bounced around\\" to find a career for herself. Avery fell in love with Phyllis' ex-husband, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), their relationship was very complicated due to the fact that he was Phyllis' ex. They overcame all of their problems. Nick then began wondering about her past relationships. She told him that the man she loved, Dylan, died during the war in Afghanistan. However, it was revealed by executive producer Jill Farren Phelps that Dylan \\"is a war veteran who was greatly traumatized by what happened to him in Afghanistan. He was severely injured and was rescued by a family who helped him recuperate. He's not been heard from for a couple of years, which is why people think he's dead\\". In January 2013, soap opera veteran actor Steve Burton joined the show's cast as Dylan McAvoy. TVLine noted that his \\"resurrection\\" \\"surely would derail\\" Avery's new life with Nick. Jillian Bowe of Zap2it described Dylan as the \\"mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up\\". Additionally, Phelps noted Avery to be \\"the great love of\\" Dylan's life, although she wasn't sure if Avery \\"had the same feelings for him\\". Flashbacks \\"to bring the audience into the history of the Dylan-Avery relationship\\" aired. Dylan came to town, initially posing under the name Mac. He got a job at Nick's nightclub, The Underground, and hoped to see Avery from afar. They eventually came face to face, shocking Avery. She was puzzled, but ultimately chose to remain with Nick instead of reuniting with Dylan. Nick and Avery soon became engaged which upset Phyllis.  Storylines  Avery is the younger sister of Phyllis. She was born in Darien, Connecticut. Growing up, the sisters were close. However their father George was bilking people out of their life savings. Phyllis turned him in and fled the family, leaving Avery behind and \\"triggering years of estrangement.\\" Avery first appeared in Genoa City in 2011 after being hired by Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) to help Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), who was wrongfully convicted of murdering Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone). Avery even pretended to flirt with Sharon's ex, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) to get to the truth to find evidence. Avery was able to create a trial for Sharon, which could be her door to freedom. Her arrival in Genoa City also seemed to disturb Phyllis, as she recognized Avery when she researched her on the internet. They ran into each other, and it was discovered that she was Phyllis's younger sister. Sharon was initially going to plead guilty when offered only 18 months (and then freedom) if she did so, however Avery made sure her children were in the court room, so she wouldn't lie and say she committed murder when she hadn't; and it worked. Months later Sharon was freed. Avery formed a friendship with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), who was not only Sharon's ex-husband of eleven years, but involved with Phyllis at the time. Once Nick left Phyllis, he and Avery became involved. To get under Phyllis' skin, Avery agreed to become Daisy Carter (a psychotic person who had given birth to Phyllis' granddaughter, to whom Phyllis managed to get full custody of) lawyer and it also allowed Daisy to spend time with her daughter, Lucy Abbott Summers. Despite this, Avery's reasoning was more personal, as she didn't have full knowledge of Daisy's potential. Sharon was later set free to go and be with her family. Avery and Nick continued to see each other, but she left him knowing he only loved Phyllis and Sharon. He left her for Phyllis. Avery represented Nick when he was against Sharon's plea to the courts to gain joint custody of their daughter, Faith; but Sharon regained joint custody. It was revealed that their father George was dying. Avery visited him on his dying bed and mended things with him, however, Phyllis didn't. Out of pure spite, Avery helped reduce Daisy's prison sentence and vowed to get her custody of Lucy. Eventually, Phyllis and Avery's rivalry calmed down and they have been cordial to each other. Avery became Victor Newman's personal lawyer, handling business at Newman Enterprises, after Michael Baldwin was sworn in as District Attorney. After Victor went missing following his marriage to Sharon, Sharon burned the prenuptial agreement which Avery had drawn up, and then took over Newman Enterprises. Nick and his sister Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle) initially want Avery's help, however, as Victor's lawyer she was obliged by law to help out Sharon, much to her dismay. Nonetheless, she helped Nick prove Sharon was an unfit leader for the company behind the scenes. Although the judge ruled that Sharon was fit to be CEO of Newman, Victor eventually returned, ending her reign of destruction. Recently following the breakdown of Nick and Phyllis' second marriage, she re-connects with Nick and they start flirting. Despite not wanting to be with him because of her sister, she continues to daydream about them being together. Avery also began connecting with her niece, Summer Newman (Hunter King).  Reception  In 2013 and 2016, Collins received Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Avery, winning in 2016.

The NhRP works largely through state- by-state litigation in what it determines to be the most appropriate common law jurisdictions and bases its arguments on existing scientific evidence concerning self-awareness and autonomy in nonhuman animals. Its sustained strategic litigation campaign has been developed primarily by a team of attorneys, legal experts, and volunteer law students who have conducted extensive research into relevant legal precedents. The NhRP filed its first lawsuits in December 2013 on behalf of four chimpanzees held in captivity in New York State. In late 2014, NhRP President Steven Wise and Executive Director Natalie Prosin announced in the Global Journal of Animal Law that the Nonhuman Rights Project was expanding its work into other countries, beginning in Switzerland, Argentina, England, Spain, Portugal, and Australia. The Nonhuman Rights Project was one of Animal Charity Evaluators' Standout Charities. History Founded by attorney Steven M. Wise, the Nonhuman Rights Project began in 2007 as a project of the Center for the Expansion of Fundamental Rights. In 2012, the Center for the Expansion of Fundamental Rights officially changed its name to the Nonhuman Rights Project. Mission and goals According to the NhRP's website, the mission of the Nonhuman Rights Project is, through education and litigation, to change the common law status of at least some nonhuman animals from mere \\"things,\\" which lack the capacity to possess any legal right, to \\"persons,\\" who possess such fundamental rights as bodily integrity and bodily liberty and those other legal rights to which evolving standards of morality, scientific discovery, and human experience entitle them. To advance this mission, the NhRP's specific goals are: 1\\\\. To persuade a United States state high court to declare that a specific nonhuman animal is a legal person who possesses the capacity for a specific legal right. 2\\\\. To persuade US state high courts to increase the number of legal rights of any nonhuman animal who is declared to be a legal person to the degree to which it should be entitled. 3\\\\. To persuade US state high courts to declare that appropriate nonhuman animals possess the capacities for legal rights and to extend legal rights to them accordingly. 4\\\\. To educate the legal profession and judiciary about the legal, social, historical and political justice of the Nonhuman Rights Project's arguments. 5\\\\. To communicate to the public and media the NhRP's mission and the justice of recognizing specific nonhuman animals as legal persons. 6\\\\. To educate the courts, the legal profession, the media, and the public about the state of current knowledge about the cognition of those nonhuman animals who are, or who might be, plaintiffs in the Nonhuman Rights Project's lawsuits. Legal claims The NhRP argues that nonhuman animals who are scientifically proven to be self-aware, autonomous beings, such as great apes, elephants, dolphins, and whales, should be recognized as legal persons under U.S. common law, with the fundamental right to bodily liberty. According to the NhRP, there is nothing in the common law that suggests that legal personhood is limited only to human beings, and certain species fit the profile that courts have used in the past to recognize legal personhood. The NhRP emphasizes the fact that currently all nonhuman animals are considered merely property, or legal \\"things,\\" without the capacity for rights. In an article published five months before the NhRP first filed suit, Chris Berdick of Boston Globe explains the organization's claims and strategy as follows: =Somerset v. Stewart= The NhRP's legal claims on behalf of captive nonhuman animals are based in part on the case of Somerset v Stewart. In that 1772 case, William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, the chief justice of the English Court of King's Bench, issued a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a slave named James Somerset; Somerset was subsequently freed. NhRP argues that it was the first time a human slave was considered to be a person and who was allowed to petition for and be granted the writ for habeas corpus. The decision was made even though there was no precedent that it relied on. The NhRP views the writ of habeas corpus as a powerful form of redress for the denial of their plaintiffs' right to bodily liberty. Commenting on the importance of the Somerset case to the NhRP in a 2014 article by Charles Siebert in The New York Times Magazine, Wise said: =Opposition and counterarguments= Some legal scholars have publicly opposed the NhRP's mission and goals. Federal appeals judge Richard Posner, for example, is opposed to legal personhood for nonhuman animals on the basis that the law grants humans special status not because of their intelligence but out of \\"a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it.\\" Attorney and Pepperdine Professor of Law Richard Cupp has argued that animal welfare laws should be sufficient for ensuring the well-being of captive nonhuman animals and that the NhRP's strategy is unnecessarily extreme. In an interview with James Gorman of The New York Times following the organization's first lawsuits, Cupp said, \\"The courts would have to dramatically expand existing common law for the cases to succeed.\\" In response, the NhRP argues that an animal welfare approach is insufficient and ineffective in terms of ending the practice of keeping chimpanzees and other cognitively complex nonhuman animals in captivity and also does nothing to address the larger issue of their status as legal property. Court cases = Tommy, Kiko, and Hercules and Leo = The NhRP filed its first lawsuits on December 2, 2013, in New York State on behalf of four captive chimpanzees, demanding that the courts grant them the right to bodily liberty via the writ of habeas corpus and to immediately send them to a sanctuary affiliated with the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance. The NhRP's New York plaintiffs were Tommy, a privately owned chimpanzee living in a cage in a shed on a used trailer lot in Gloversville, NY; Kiko, a privately owned chimpanzee living on private property in Niagara Falls, NY; and Hercules and Leo, two chimpanzees owned by New Iberia Research Center and loaned to the Anatomy Department at Stony Brook University for use in locomotion research. In response to the lawsuit, Tommy's owner, Patrick Lavery, defended the chimpanzee's living conditions: \\"He's really got it good. He's got a lot of enrichment. He's got color TV, cable and a stereo.\\" All of the petitions were rejected. On March 19, 2015 case of Hercules and Leo was refiled. And on April 20, 2015, Justice Barbara Jaffe issued an Order to Show Cause and Writ of Habeas Corpus. A hearing was scheduled at which the State University of New York at Stoney Brook was ordered to show why Hercules and Leo should be not be released and transferred to the Save the Chimps sanctuary. Because the order's title included the phrase \\"WRIT TO HABEAS CORPUS\\" it made headlines around the world and was misinterpreted as granting the right to liberty to a chimpanzee. Justice Jaffe's order was amended and refiled with the phrase WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS manually crossed out. A hearing was held on May 27 and on July 29, 2015, Justice Jaffe issued an order denying Hercules and Leo's petition. Because the petition was reviewed as well as the reasoning in the decision, NhRP considered it to be a \\"one giant leap for the Nonhuman Rights Project in its fight for the fundamental rights of nonhuman animals.\\" Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus In filing the petitions NhRP's intent was: 1\\\\. To have the chimpanzees recognized as human-like beings with a common law right to liberty, specifically, to be recognized as autonomous and self-determining beings that cannot be legally considered as property. and 2\\\\. To have the chimpanzees released and transferred to a North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance (NAPSA) sanctuary. A writ of habeas corpus allows an individual to assert one's right to liberty and demand for release from unlawful imprisonment. The right to file the writ is protected in the US Constitution under Article 1, Section 9, and in New York State it is to be filed under article 70 which states that \\"a person illegally imprisoned or otherwise restrained with his liberty within the state ... may petition without notice for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of such detention and for deliverance.\\" In order for their petitions to be considered, NhRP had to first show that the chimpanzees are persons who could file them. NhRP's arguments were partially based on precedent, a legal term that encompasses all previous legal decisions and reasoning also known as common law. These cases can be considered to be relevant and sometimes decisive to the current facts and circumstances at hand. As its first step, NhRP argued that the legal term person is not a synonym for a human being, but instead refers to an entity with a capacity to possess legal rights. It emphasized that there are no necessary conditions for determining that an entity is a legal person, and that going back to the 18th century there have been cases granting legal rights to non human entities such as corporations. NhRP argued that the fact that a chimpanzee is not a human being should not prevent the argument that it is a legal person with a habeas corpus right to liberty. It then made its central point, that based on previous common law decisions such as Somerset v Stewart, autonomy and self-determination are the human qualities that are intended to be protected by the writ of habeas corpus. And because chimpanzees are now known to possesses the same qualities, the habeas corpus right to liberty should be expanded to the chimpanzee species. More than thirty pages of the petition were devoted to going over chimpanzee evolutionary development, neurology, social practices and complex cognition. NhRP argued that a chimpanzee possesses qualities such as: NhRP emphasized that it was not seeking a granting of human rights for its plaintiffs but only a narrow expansion of the right to bodily liberty protected by the writ of habeas corpus. Initial holdings All three petitions where denied on the grounds that the chimpanzees were not persons and thus the issues in the petitions would not be considered. In an hour long hearing regarding Tommy's Third District case, the Hon. Joseph Sise stated that: The judge in Kiko's Fourth district case, the Hon. Ralph A. Boniello III, also held a hearing, denying the NhRP's petition on the grounds that Kiko is not a person for purposes of habeas corpus and stating that he did not want to be the first \\"to make that leap of faith.\\" The judge in Hercules' and Leo's Second District case, the Hon. W. Gerard Asher, did not hold a hearing, writing in a decision that he was denying the petition for habeas corpus on the basis that chimpanzees are not considered legal persons. Appeals =Tommy's case= The NhRP appealed the lower court's decision in Tommy's case. The appeal was granted and oral argument took place on October 8, 2014 before the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department in Albany, NY. The hearing received significant media attention. On December 5, 2014, the appellate court issued its ruling. In its decision the court confirmed the earlier ruling that there is no precedent for finding that an animal could be thought of as a person. It further reasoned that in accordance with the social contract one's rights cannot come without obligations: On December 18, 2014, the NhRP announced that it had filed a motion for permission to appeal to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. =Kiko's case= The NhRP also appealed the lower court's decision in Kiko's case. Like Tommy's, Kiko's appeal was also granted and oral argument took place on December 2, 2014 before the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, Fourth Department in Rochester, NY. At Kiko's hearing the two main issues were: how could it be determined that a chimpanzee actually wanted to be released, and could a transfer to another location be considered as a release from confinement, the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus. NhRP argued that the issue of whether or not Kiko actually desired to be released was regularly resolved in cases dealing with autonomous and self-determining human beings who at that time are incompetent or are too young to make those decisions. When asked which one of those grounds is most similar to the circumstances of this petition, NhRP replied that a chimpanzee is more akin to a child near the age of five rather than a mentally disabled adult. On January 2, 2015, the appellate court issued its decision, denying the petition on the grounds that \\"habeas corpus does not lie where a petitioner seeks only to change the conditions of confinement rather than the confinement itself. We therefore conclude that habeas corpus does not lie herein.\\" Commenting on the Court's decision in a blog post on the NhRP's website, Wise wrote: On April 20, 2015, the NhRP filed a motion for permission to appeal in New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals.  Hercules and Leo Reconsidered  ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE & WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS NhRP also filed an appeal to Hercules and Leo's lower court decision. On April 3, 2014 the appeal was denied by the Second Appellate Department in Brooklyn, this dismissal was based on a technicality and NhRP's briefs were not considered. On March 19, 2015, NhRP was allowed to refile the petition at the county court in Manhattan which is under the First Appellate Department. Justice Barbara Jaffe was assigned to the case. On April 20, 2015, Justice Barbara Jaffe issued an Order To Show Cause & Writ of Habeas Corpus. A hearing was scheduled at which the State University of New York at Stoney Brook was ordered to show why Hercules and Leo should be not be released and transferred to the Save the Chimps sanctuary. Because this order was titled as ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE & WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS it immediately made the headlines around the world as granting the right to liberty to the chimpanzees. \\"Justice Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus\\" was the headline of NhRP's breaking news post on its website. Because of the global headlines, Justice Jaffe's order was amended and refiled with the phrase WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS manually crossed out. It is likely that this was done to make it clear that the order was granted only to allow a hearing for an evaluation of arguments made in NhRP's petition. The next day NhRP updated its posting stating that \\"the Order does not necessarily mean that the Court has declared that the two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, are legal persons for the purpose of an Article 70 common law writ of habeas corpus proceeding.\\" On May 27, a hearing was held for the purposes of the initial evaluation of Hercules and Leo's Petitions. Justice Jaffe's ruling was entered on July 29, 2015. In her ruling Justice Jaffe stated that in making her decision she was obliged to follow the ruling of a higher court. Because of a conflict in relevant decisions of between the First Department and the Fourth Department where Tommy's case was decided, Justice Jaffe relied on the Third District's Tommy decision. That appellate court ruled that a chimpanzee could not be considered a person with the right to liberty because there is no precedent for such a decision, and that rights cannot be granted without social responsibilities. She further stated that even if she was not bound by the Third Department decision in Tommy it should be up to the legislature or higher courts given their role in setting government policy. Even though the petition was denied, NhRP interpreted Justice Jaffe's decision as a victory. In his posting titled \\"That's One Small Step for a Judge, One Giant Leap for the Nonhuman Rights Project\\", Mr. Wise emphasized the fact that Justice Jaffe agreed with NhRP when finding that \\"'persons' are not restricted to human beings, and that who is a 'person' is not a question of biology, but of public policy and principle.\\" He finished by quoting the last paragraph of Justice Jaffe's decision: Despite the ruling in its favor, the university released an official statement that it would no longer conduct scientific studies on Hercules and Leo. An appeal was filed in August 2015, however that December Stony Brook transferred the chimpanzees back the New Iberia Research Center, ending the case, since the New York State Court no longer had jurisdiction over them. On September 1, 2015, NhRP's requests to file appeals to the highest court in Tommy's and Kiko's cases were denied. On December 2, 2015 NhRP refiled Tommy's petition in the First Department in Manhattan, New York City, this is the same district as the one where Justice Jaffe issued her ruling. The NhRP and PETA's slavery lawsuit In October 2011, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a complaint in a California federal district court alleging that SeaWorld was enslaving its captive orcas in violation of the orcas' rights under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The NhRP, while acknowledging that the orcas might be considered slaves according to common usage of the term, vehemently opposed the lawsuit on the grounds that it was strategically misguided and counter- productive; the NhRP's critique highlighted the existence of differing strategies for achieving rights and protections for nonhuman animals. \\"The claim that an orca is enslaved within the meaning of the Thirteenth Amendment is unlikely even to receive a single vote from a federal appellate court in 2011,\\" Wise wrote on the NhRP's website. \\"It is unthinkable that the present United States Supreme Court would agree.\\" In January 2012, the presiding judge, the Hon. Richard Miller, granted permission to the NhRP to appear in the case as an amicus curiae (or Friend of the Court) to, as Wise said, \\"ensure that the orcas' best interests are being properly represented, that their legal status is advanced, and that an unfavorable ruling inflicts the least possible harm on the development of an animal rights jurisprudence.\\" In February 2012, the case was dismissed. The judge wrote in his ruling that \\"the only reasonable interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment's plain language is that it applies to persons, and not to non-persons such as orcas.\\" In an interview with the blog Earth in Transition, Wise said of the ruling Documentary Documentary filmmakers D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus announced in July 2012 that their next project, Unlocking the Cage, would follow the NhRP's efforts to achieve legal rights for nonhuman animals. In April 2014, Pennebaker-Hegedus Films released a preview of the as-yet- unfinished documentary in the form of a New York Times Op-Doc called Animals Are Persons Too. Unlocking the Cage was released in 2016.  Animal Charity Evaluators review  Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) named NhRP one of its Standout Charities in its 2015 and 2016 annual charity recommendations. ACE designates as Standout Charities those organizations which they do not feel are as strong as their Top Charities, but which excel in at least one way and are exceptionally strong compared to animal charities in general. Among the NhRP's strengths, according to ACE, is the fact that it is the only organization they know of directly working towards legal personhood for animals, which \\"could be the most promising avenue for the proper consideration of nonhuman animals in our society.\\" The NhRP has also garnered public attention with their cases, which has plausibly helped the animal advocacy cause. ACE states as a weakness NhRP's focus on certain cognitively complex animals, and uncertainty about whether the NhRP's activities will eventually expand to larger groups of animals.

Plot summary Odd Thomas and his traveling companion Annamaria have been invited by a reclusive billionaire to be his guests at his sprawling, pristine estate, Roseland. However, something is deeply wrong within the walls of the sprawling property. The few staff there harbor malice to anyone from the outside world, and as Odd explores the estate, the land and buildings seem to flip between static beauty and a hell on earth... which he finds is influenced by machinery designed by a genius from the past. Odd can't just gather his friend, their dogs (one alive, one a ghost) and escape. Despite the warnings, Annamaria, who has mysteries of her own, has hinted to Odd that Roseland has secrets far more sinister than just an unusual state of preservation.

He meets the spirit of a woman riding a horse in a long white dress stained red from wounds that she received at her death. As he tries to understand her needs and help her, the sky behind her turns an unnatural color, becomes stained with the dark jet-streams of the debris of war, and he sees impossible, physical monsters wheeling to attack him.

The name of the family is derived from one or more members known as Sacchetto. According to Ugolino di Vieri (1438‚Äì1516),\\"nobile Sacchetti genus est, moenia primus romanus sangius\\". In the 19th century, the Sacchetti inherited the title of Prince of Palestrina and permission to use the Barberini name. History Genealogy of the Sacchetti family 10th-17th centuries. Right Roman Branch: Marquises of Castel Romano and origins of the Colonna-Barberini-Sacchetti, Princes of Palestrina. LEFT: The Neapolitan Branch: In service to the Norman and Angevin Kings of Naples in Puglia, Calabria and Abruzzo The 17th century author, Eugenio Gamurrini in his Istoria genealogica delle famiglie nobili toscane et umbre (1668‚Äì1685) claimed with little evidence that this family, like many others in Florence, had roots in prominent Roman families. He claimed the family derived from the \\"gens Cornelia\\", one of the most distinguished families of the Roman Republic, from who arose in 485 BC the consul Servius Cornelius Cossus Maluginensis. According to Gamurrini the Sacchetti descend from the Cornelii Merulae branch. The family was certainly well established in Florence during the 12th century. Dante Alighieri mentions the family in The Divine Comedy, Paradise Canto XVI in which Dante's Great- grandfather, Cacciaguida degli Elisei (c.1098 ‚Äì c. 1148), lists the ancient families of Florence > \\"Grand'era gia\` la colonna del Vaio (Pigli), Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti e > Barucci e Galli e quei ch'arrossan per lo staio\\" (a reference to the Tosinghi family that were a branch of the Visdomini) (Great was already the column of minever, Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti, and Barucci and Galli, and they who blush for the bushel.) In The Inferno, Canto XXIX:1-36, Dante recounted meeting his father's first cousin, Geri del Bello. He had been condemned to the ninth chasm for his disputes with the Sacchetti, most likely Brodaio Sacchetti, consul in 1203. At the time of Dante's vision the feud had not been settled. The families were finally reconciled in 1342. Tomb of Tommaso di Tommaso Sacchetti in transept of Santa Croce, Florence. Tomasso was married to Tancia, daughter of Palla Strozzi who was exiled by the Medici. Tomasso appears to have been the only son-in-law of Palla Strozzi not to have suffered under the Medici. However, his son Jacopo married Niccolosa di Giannozo di Giovanni Strozzi, whose name was removed from the borse of the Tre Maggiori in June 1455 as dangerous to the regime.A Florentine family in crisis: the Strozzi in the fifteenth century.

The villa had its contemporary critics; Bernini likened the structure to a \\"Christmas crib\\" (Presepio). = Florentine Branch = According to Ugolino di Vieri the Sacchetti were among the families forced to relocate from Fiesole to Florence after the former was conquered in 1125. In 1137, the earliest document asserts Sacchetto and his brother Bernardino di Bonizo di Merlo contract a tower association with the Uberti family.(Strozziane Uguccioni, August 11, 1137). It was the descendants of Sacchetto that would eventually use this as a patronymic and become known as the Sacchetti.

The Sienese defeated the Florentines and the Sacchetti were exiled but later returned with the eventual defeat of the Sienese and the final expulsion of the Florentine Ghibellines. Despite the family's support for Guelf party, the Sacchetti were barred from public office in the Ordinances of Justice in 1293 and 1295. The ordinances were intended to exclude Ghibelline sympathizers and nobles with a reputation for their bellicose nature and a predilection for violence to impose their will. Eventually the family returned to the council and the highest offices of the Republic. Antonio di Forese Sacchetti was appointed by the Signoria on July 7, 1375 as one of the eight members of a committee, that became known as the \\"Otto dei Preti\\" (Eight Priests), to carry out the taxation of the clergy in Florence and Fiesole. The tax was a forced loan to pay for the nonaggression pact with the mercenary Sir John Hawkwood at a cost of 130,000 florins. Antonio with the other members were excommunicated by Pope Gregory XI. Gregory XI excommunicated Antonio di Forese Sacchetti and the other the members of the committee of The Eight Priests on the March 31, 1376 . The family has two main branches, one that remained in Florence up to the time of the hegemony of the Medici and relocated to Rome in the sixteenth century and the Neapolitan branch that went into the service of the Normans in southern Italy shortly after their forced transfer from Fiesole.

He was a trading partner of the Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII and married Francesca Altoviti, the daughter of Alessandro Altoviti. The marriage had the effect of transferring to the Sacchetti financial resources, property, profitable links with the curia and client relations already established by the Altoviti.

Summary of the PƒÅ·∏∑i version The KƒÅyagatƒÅsati sutta stresses the need for constant awareness of the body's position, \\"When walking, the monk discerns, 'I am walking.' When standing, he discerns, 'I am standing.' When sitting, he discerns, 'I am sitting.' When lying down, he discerns, 'I am lying down.'\\" Kayagata-sati Sutta. The sutta also outlines the practice of \\"reflections on repulsiveness of the body\\" (pa·π≠ikk≈´lamanasikƒÅra). In this practice, a meditator reflects on various parts of the body (nails, hair, bodily organs, fluids), noting their impurity. The Sutta also recommends meditation on the impermanence of the body and death by contemplating human corpses in various states of decomposition. \\"Furthermore, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground‚Äîone day, two days, three days dead‚Äîbloated, livid, & festering, he applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.'\\"Kayagata-sati Sutta. The sutta then explains the attainment of the four r≈´pa jhƒÅnas, states of calm concentration reached through meditation. Finally, the sutta outlines the ten benefits of these practices, which are as follows: ::# Conquering displeasure & delight ::# Conquering fear & dread ::# Resistance to temperature, pain and the elements. ::# Attainment of the four jhƒÅnas ::# \\"Manifold supranormal powers\\" (e.g., walking on water, walking through walls) ::# Supernatural hearing ::# Psychic powers‚Äîknowing the \\"awareness of other beings\\" ::# Recollection of past lives ::# Seeing \\"by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human\\" ::# \\"Through the ending of the mental effluents, he remains in the effluent-free awareness-release & discernment-release, having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here & now.\\"Kayagata-sati Sutta.

Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system. At standstill, or while on standby, pump and driver bearings are preserved by the surrounding oil mist, which exists in the bearing housing space at a pressure just barely higher than ambient. These pump and driver bearings are lubricated from the time when atomized oil globules join (or wet out) to become larger oil droplets. This joining-into- large-droplets starts whenever the equipment shafts rotate, which is when small globules come into contact with each other and start coating the bearing elements. As of April 2019, over 160,000 process centrifugal pumps are operating with oil mist as the sole bearing lubricant. The estimated number of electric motors on pure oil mist exceeds 50,000; several of these at a Texas Gulf Coast petrochemical facility have been in flawless service since 1978. Oil mist technology is mature and has been in highly successful plant-wide use since the early 1960s. There are also plant-wide oil distribution systems whereby liquid oil (not an oil/air mixture) is pressurized and injected, through spray nozzles, into the pump bearings. These oil spray systems are not to be confused with the more economical oil mist systems. However, both oil mist and oil spray applications can take credit for lower frictional losses and both should be taken into account while performing cost justification analyses.

Having begun filmmaking at an early age, Hoolboom released his first major work, a \\"film that's not quite a film\\" entitled White Museum, in 1986. Although he continued to produce films, his rate of production improved drastically after he was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 or 1989; this gave a \\"new urgency\\" to his works. Since then he has made dozens of films, two of which have won Best Short Film at the Toronto International Film Festival. His films have also featured in more than 200 film festivals worldwide. Early life and career Hoolboom was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a Dutch father and Dutch-Indonesian mother on 1 January 1959. He took up filmmaking at an early age, using the family's Super 8 camera, and did his high school education in Burlington, Ontario. In 1980 Hoolboom enrolled at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario. During his three years there he became known for his works which, according to Canadian film critic Geoff Pevere, \\"demonstrated a consuming interest in navigating the outer limits of perception, of language, of self, of mechanical reproduction, of bodily sensation and experience\\". He found wide accolade in 1986 with the release of a \\"film that's not quite a film\\", White Museum, a 32-minute work which spliced audio clips of pop culture media and commentary on the state of film over a clear leader. Many of his films during the late 1980s, such as From Home (1988) and Eat (1989), dealt with various aspects of the body. Hoolboom, while serving a two-year stint at the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre, was diagnosed with HIV in 1989, after going to donate blood. In the six years following his diagnosis he made a further 27 films, with his focus changing to the impermanence of existence, sexuality, and HIV/AIDS. This period has been noted as having a \\"new urgency\\". He also ran a magazine on fringe films, The Independent Eye. In the mid-1990s Hoolboom won Best Canadian Short Film at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) twice, first with 1993's Frank's Cock. The eight-minute film dealt with an unnamed man, portrayed by Callum Keith Rennie, who considered himself the \\"Michael Jordan of sex\\", losing his lover Frank to AIDS. The story was conveyed with a monologue occupying a quadrant of a four-part split-screen, with other quadrants including popular art, gay pornography, and representations of human creation. When accepting the award at TIFF, Hoolboom quipped \\"Frank's Cock has never seemed so large\\". That year also saw the creation of two further works: Valentine's Day, which followed a man who splurged on making a film after being diagnosed with AIDS; and Kanada, in which Wayne Gretzky serves as prime minister and uses broadcast rights for a civil war to pay off the Canada's debt. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail wrote that Valentine's Day was reminiscent of the works of Marquis de Sade and the 1973 French/Italian film La Grande Bouffe. Three years later, in 1996, Hoolboom released Letters From Home, based in part on a speech by LGBT rights activist Vito Russo. The 15-minute film features commentary on popular misconceptions of AIDS and ways that the general public deal with AIDS patients before ending on an optimistic note, expressing hope that the AIDS crisis would one day be over. In 1998 he released the feature-length film Panic Bodies, a six-part work dealing with aspects of the body which, according to Hoolboom, is fragmented like AIDS fragments the body. That year he also released Plague Years: A Life in Underground Movies, a book which blends aspects of film scripts and autobiographical writing. A four-minute film tribute to Hoolboom by Wrik Mead, entitled Hoolboom, was sponsored by Arts Toronto and debuted in 1999. The following year Hoolboom released Inside the Pleasure Dome: Fringe Film in Canada, a series of 23 interviews with Canadian fringe filmmakers regarding the industry, with a foreword by Atom Egoyan. Later film work Hoolboom made Tom, a biopic of the New York-based avant-garde filmmaker Tom Chomont, in 2002, using layering to explore themes common in Chomont's work while exploring the latter's sometimes-incestuous relationship with his brother. This was followed by Imitations of Life, a ten- segmented film which, through the reuse of film clips from mainstream media, deals with how film and popular culture can affect one's memory. He helped establish Fringe Online, which presents fringe works by Canadian directors, in 2004. Hoolboom released his debut novel, The Steve Machine, in 2008; he had previously published several non-fiction works. In 2009 Hoolboom received the Bell Award in Video Art, presented by the Canada Council for the Arts for \\"exceptional contribution to the advancement of video art and practices in Canada\\". That year he released the book Practical Dreamers: Conversations with Movie Artists, which profiled 27 Canadian independent film artists, and made Mark, a look into the life of his friend, political activist and filmmaker Mark Karbusicky, which combined the found footage and biography genres. In 2014 an International Jury composed by Eva Truffaut, Benjamin Cantu, ricci/forte, Manuele Fior and Mathilde Bayle awarded his Buffalo Death Mask as best short film in the International Competition Queer Short of Sicilia Queer filmfest. In 2016 Hoolboom and Chase Joynt coauthored the non-fiction book You Only Live Twice: Sex, Death and Transition.Jade Colbert, \\"Review: New books from Eleanor Wachtel, Chase Joynt and Mike Hoolboom\\". The Globe and Mail, May 12, 2016. The book received a Lambda Literary Award nomination for Transgender Non-Fiction at the 29th Lambda Literary Awards in 2017.\\"M.E. Girard, Vivek Shraya among 13 Canadians nominated for 2017 Lambda Literary Awards\\". Quill & Quire, March 14, 2017. Reception Cameron Bailey, writing in the Canadian fashion magazine Flare, described Hoolboom as \\"Canada's most important avant- garde filmmaker since Michael Snow\\"; Liam Lacey, writing for The Globe and Mail, echoes the description, adding that Hoolboom is also \\"one of the best chroniclers of other fringe filmmakers\\". His works had been shown at over 200 film festivals by 1998. Awards Hoolboom was awarded a Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2017. Filmography Hoolboom has released more than fifty films in the course of his career.

Plot  In the middle of the night, Harold Dingle, the owner of a website dedicated to slasher films who has been hired on to Perimount Production's upcoming remake of the cult classic Slaughter Camp 13, has his throat slit by a hooded assailant. The next day, the crew of the Slaughter Camp 13 remake head out to the shooting location early, as a part of a bonding exercise. The group are followed by Harold's killer, who had murdered and carjacked the clerk of a store the crew stopped at. After the group reach their destination and set up, the killer spies on them, garrots Kevin with a cable when he goes off for some solitude, and impales Ron with a pipe while he is using the outhouse. By nightfall, the other crew members become worried about Kevin and Ron, so they pair off and go in search of them. After becoming separated from his search buddy Tom, Ari is hacked in the face with a machete by the killer. The next to die is Amy, who is forced to ingest cleaning chemicals when she wanders off alone to snort cocaine. Back at the campsite, Marco and Sally Anne (who had stayed behind in case Kevin or Ron came back) are stabbed to death with a pole while having sex in their tent. Their bodies are found Seanna, Adrienne, and Peter, who cannot get any cell phone reception, or drive away because all the vehicles have been sabotaged. The trio decide to go to the camp tool shed to see if it has anything that can fix the cars, and are beaten there by Tom, who is beheaded with a shovel by the killer. Moments later, the remaining crew members arrive, with Peter gathering up supplies and heading back to the cars alone, instructing Adrienne and Seanna to stay behind and barricade themselves in the shed. When Peter returns to the vehicles and tries one after tinkering with it, he is knocked out by the killer, who was hiding in the backseat. Seanna becomes hysterical and runs back to the campsite, where the killer ambushes her, burns her face on the gas grill, and jams kebab sticks down her throat. Adrienne goes after Seanna, and sees what looks the killer seated on a log at the campsite. She attacks the figure with an axe, only to discover that it was a bound and gagged Peter. The blood splattered killer then appears and beheads Adrienne. Afterward, he turns to a hidden camera and proclaims, \\"No more fucking remakes!\\" The killer sends the tape to Steve Lehman, a Perimount Pictures executive, who calls the studio and orders that production of Slaughter Camp 13 be halted. Twenty-eight days later, the killer reads an announcement on the internet that another classic slasher, The Babysitter Murders, is being remade. Enraged, the killer opens a trunk full of horror film memorabilia, grabs replicas of Michael Myers's mask and knife, and heads out.

A score of three stars out of five was awarded by Slasherpool, which stated The Remake is \\"a relatively well-crafted slasher flick\\" that despite its basic premise was worth a watch because \\"it takes a stand against horror remakes and I am very appreciative that someone took the time to make a movie like this\\". Wildside Cinema found The Remake mildly entertaining, even if it did \\"serve up a few tired clich√©s as well as giving in to some of the very stereotypes this film was attempting to dispel (i.e. horror is all about T&A;)\\".

He entered private practice in Portland, Oregon. He served as commissary for the Grande Ronde Indian Reservation in Oregon from 1864 to 1869.

He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 18, 1890, and received his commission on July 22, 1890. His service terminated on May 12, 1899, due to his removal from office by President William McKinley. He was succeeded on the board by Israel F. Fischer. =Circumstances of his removal from office= In early 1899, Shurtleff received a request from the Treasury Department to resign from the Board, but declined to do so. It is believed partisan political pressure was behind the request. On May 3, 1899, President McKinley wrote Shurtleff, informing him that he was being removed from office, effective upon the appointment and qualification of his successor, which occurred on May 12, 1899. McKinley gave no cause for Shurtleff's removal and Shurtleff was not given the opportunity to defend himself before a commission.

In the case Shurtleff vs. United States the Supreme Court ruled that barring a specific prohibition in the statute creating an office, the President of the United States may remove any officer without cause, thus denying Shurtleff's petition.

Seon-woo inadvertently become a primary suspect and struggles to prove his innocence. Plot For the past two years, while on suspension for adultery with a police chief's wife, detective Kang Seon-woo (Park Hee-soon), has been running a private-eye agency specializing in adultery cases. He's also being sued for divorce by his wife, Hye-young (Cha Soo-yeon). A couple of days before resuming his old job, Seon-u accepts a case from a woman, Kim Soo-jin (Yoon Jae), who wears a particularly alluring perfume. She says her husband, casino billionaire Nam Yeong-gil (Jo Won-hee), is conducting an affair with another woman at a love hotel in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province, outside Seoul. Seon-woo checks into an adjoining room in the unmanned hotel and is met there by Soo-jin. Instead of immediately surprising the lovers, Soo-jin invites Seon-woo to a drink and seduces him. Seon-woo wakes up next to her dead body, and in the next room finds the husband also dead. The woman there says her name is also Kim Soo-jin (Park Si- yeon) and the dead man is her husband. Along with his idiot assistant, ex-con Gi-poong (Lee Kwang-soo), Seon-woo cleans the crime scenes and buries the bodies, realizing he's been framed for the double murder. Resuming his job at Jonggu Police Station, Seon-woo investigates the case along with two colleagues: the stubbornly procedural Seo (Kim Jung-tae), who dislikes him, and the easy-going Han Gil-ro (Joo Sang-wook), who admires him. Seon-woo has noticed that Soo-jin wears the same perfume as her dead namesake, and she admits she wanted a divorce from her husband, who used to beat her.

A member of the Senate, he was appointed consul suffectus sometime prior to AD 183, most probably during the last years of the reign of Marcus Aurelius. From 183 to 185, he was the Proconsular imperial legate (governor) of Syria Palaestina.

In gratitude for his support, Severus appointed Domitius Dexter as Praefectus urbi of Rome in June 193.

Apau Data) is a remote Kenyah Badeng village settlement in the hilly interior of the Ulu Kakus Tatau division of Sarawak, Malaysia elevates to 650 metres, not far from Tubau and Belaga district. To be exact, Data Kakus is located at the upstream of Sungai Burok and Sungai Nyabet. The highest peak in Ulu Kakus is called Gunung Lumut about 828m located on the peak of Lumut Range not too far from Sungai Bekuyat and Sungai Kakus. Travel to Data Kakus involves a five hours 4WD drive from Bintulu or Belaga, to get to Data Kakus one has to take the Bintulu-Bakun road and look for the junction to KTS camp from KTS camp to Simpang Jonat. It takes about 60 km using the logging road and from simpang Jonat it takes another 18 km to reach Data Kakus. It is also possible to trek Data Kakus from Belaga and it takes five to seven hours trekking from Long Sungai Pelaran (Sg. Sanan baan Kenyah), Sungai Ngajah from Rajang river then conquer Gunung Ngajah about 444m. The Kakus River or Batang Tatau begins as a stream near Data Kakus called Alo Nyabet or e-iut Nyabet or Sungai Burok, and it flows through Data Kakus, the end point where small boats such as 'moto setinding' can navigate. It is also possible to travel downriver from Data Kakus by longboat to Tatau town, it takes almost a day to get to Tatau town by boat as the river is too shallow, winding and small. Neighbouring settlements include: *Rumah Ado northwest *Sungai Tinggili northwest *Long Beyak southwest *Sungai Kalavang southwest *Long Basurou northwest *Sungai Kakus northwest *Nyulau north *Kampung Kenyah Badeng Senep north Rice production Data Kakus paddy hill rice field - October 2004 This is the main activity for most of the Kenyah people in Data Kakus, where most of the communities grow the paddy hill at a few fertile land such as Sungai Padai, Lalut Deram, Ulu Sungai Burok, Long Ledong, Long Basuruo, Usun Uma', Iut Nyabet, Sungai Kakus, Abak Uma', Diam Songan and Nyulau. The traditional paddy planting is started in early August and a few months before that we are clearing the land by burning the whole paddy field area. Planting paddy hill takes place each year in August and September (nugan), and harvesting starts in February the following year. Infrastructure The only road connecting Data Kakus to Bintulu is a rugged logging road by using a four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicle. The journey from Bintulu to Data Kakus will be tougher if the road becomes slippery, muddy or flooded during the rainy season. The lack of proper access roads has caused a high living cost in Data Kakus because goods have to be transported from nearby towns by land. Power generation in Data Kakus is provided by Solar Panels and diesel generators. Data Kakus solar project was completed by Sarawak Energy in 2017 which led to a more reliable electricity supply. The telephone reception and Internet connection are not available in Data Kakus we hope that the government can provide a telecommunication tower and a solar-powered Very-Small-Aperture Terminal (VSAT) in Data Kakus to make this is possible in the future. Villagers need to travel about an hour to get to an area that is called Apau Saga to be able to receive the telecommunication signal and make or receive the telephone calls. There is only one primary school in the Data Kakus that is SK Ulu Kakus primary school. Therefore, students must pursue their secondary education either in Belaga or Bintulu.

History =Beginnings: the Arnault family= In 1971, Bernard Arnault started to work in his family business, the industrial and public works construction company Ferret-Savinel, owned by his father, Jean L√©on Arnault. There he began to develop real estate activities. In 1974, he convinced his father, then CEO, to change the focus of the company, sell the division of industrial construction to Quillery and use the money to enter fully into the business of real estate. Following that sale, Ferret-Savinel changed its name, becoming Ferinel, and, focused on the real estate market, began increasing its portfolio. In the 1980s, the company continued to grow, being one of the largest companies in the Paris property sector and serving as a springboard for Arnault's future endeavors, particularly with its acquisition of the textile company Groupe Boussac in 1984. In 1988, following this success, the headquarters were transferred from Roubaix to Paris and the real estate branch was renamed George V Group. =CGE steps up= The Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux (CGE) was established in the mid-19th century in order to provide water supply services to France's industrial cities. For the early 20th century, CGE was already one of France's largest private companies. Through the first half of the century, CGE remained focused on its core water utilities operations. In the 1960s, however, CGE launched a new diversification strategy that led it into a variety of new markets over the next two decades, including the construction and real estate sales and development sectors. In 1979, the company increased this activity with the acquisition of Maison Phenix, a leading real state company. In 1988, CGE made another important purchase, obtaining the construction company Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale d'Entreprise (the future Vinci). In the 90s, during the French real estate crisis, CGE gathered all its residential real estate and development activities in a new subsidiary, called MI SA, which soon begun to be the leader of the French housing market. In 1995, CGE bought the George V real estate division from Groupe Arnault. =CGE restructure: CGIS era= CGE became a giant company, with a wide range of activities (construction, telecommunications, pay television, facilities management, the operation of amusement parks, and others), but the incompatibity between its real estate and construction components led it into a crisis in the mid-1990s. CGE was restructured and the construction sector was formed into a separate company, Vinci. In 1996, the real estate branch was also reorganised into a sole subsidiary, Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Immobilier et de Services (CGIS). The lack of coordination between different areas, however, continued. CGIS had to sell many assets to stay afloat and CGE finally decided to separate from the real estate area, adopt the name Vivendi, and refocus itself as a media and communications firm. CGIS and MI were apart soon after. =European expansion and refocus: Nexity era= As a new independent company, CGIS difficulties continued. It sold its hotels to Accor and Pierre & Vacances and a number of its La D√©fense buildings to Unibail. In 2000 CGIS was sold in a management buyout backed by CDC Ixis Capital, LBO France, and Lehman Brothers, changing its name to Nexity. In 2001, was created the Spanish subsidiary (even though operations there were made with French property since the 1990s), as well as the Portuguese. In 2002, was established Nexity Belgium. In 2003, Nexity separate itself from its engineering services branch, Cotebo, in order to focus on property services and development. In January 2004, it strengthened its relatively weak real estate services sector with the purchase of Saggel. In July 2007, the Nexity shareholders approved the issuance of 19997501 shares, representing a 38.2 percent stake, for the Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne et de Pr√©voyance (CNCE), through the Groupe Caisse d'Epargne (GCE), in exchange of a 25 percent of Cr√©dit Foncier de France, 31.9 percent of Eurosic and 100 percent of CGE Immobilier services division, including Lamy. Later, CNCE (currently Groupe BPCE) expanded its stake to 41.4 percent. In January 2009, Nexity sold its stake in Cr√©dit Foncier to CNCE by 540 million euros. Activity Nexity operates as a real estate development company in Europe. Its working areas include residential properties, office buildings, offices, business parks, warehouses, distribution centers, office facilities, and hotels. The company also provides residential and commercial real estate, asset management, and property investment services. This is carried out through several divisions. =Divisions= Nexity Enterprises This division specialises in the development and renovation of skyscrapers and similar structures.

Its textual history began with a (4th century BCE) text/compendium known as the Zhou Shu (\\"Book of Zhou\\"), which was possibly not differentiated from the corpus of the same name in the extant Book of Documents. Western Han dynasty (206-9 BCE) editors listed 70 chapters of YZS, of which 59 are extant as texts, and the rest only as chapter titles. Such condition is described for the first time by Wang Shihan ÁéãÂ£´Êº¢ in 1669.Zhou Yuxiu, 61. Circulation ways of the individual chapters before that point (merging of different texts or single text's editions, substitution, addition, conflation with commentaries etc.) are subject to scholarly debates (see below). Traditional Chinese historiography classified the Yi Zhou Shu as a zashi ÈõúÂè≤ \\"unofficial history\\" and excluded it from the canonical dynastic Twenty-Four Histories. Titles This early Chinese historical text has four titles: Zhou zhi, Zhou shu \\"Documents/Book of Zhou\\", Yi Zhoushu \\"Lost/Leftover Documents/Book of Zhou\\", and Jizhong Zhou shu \\"Ji Tomb Documents/Book of Zhou\\". Zhou zhi Âë®Âøó appears once throughout the transmitted texts: in the Zuo zhuan (Duke Wen, 2 - 625 BCE), along the quote presently found in YZS. The reference is valuable since it differentiates YZS from the corpus of other documents shu and possibly refers to its educational function.Luo Jiaxiang 2006:60-61. Zhoushu (or Zhou shu) ‚Äì combining Zhou Âë® \\"Zhou dynasty\\" and shu Êõ∏ \\"writing; document; book; letter\\" ‚Äì is the earliest record of the present title. Depending upon the semantic interpretation of shu, Zhoushu can be translated \\"Book(s) of Zhou\\" (cf. Hanshu Êº¢Êõ∏ Book of Han) or \\"Documents of Zhou\\" (cf. Shujing Êõ∏Á∂ì Book of Documents). In Modern Standard Chinese usage, Zhoushu is the title of the Book of Zhou history about the later Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581). Yizhoushu (or Yi Zhou shu) adds yi ÈÄ∏ \\"escape; flee; neglect; missing; lost; remain\\" to the title, which scholars interpret in two ways. Either \\"Lost Book(s) of Zhou\\", with a literal translation of yi as \\"lost\\" (cf. yishu ÈÄ∏Êõ∏ \\"lost books; ancient works no longer in existence\\"). Or \\"Remaining Book(s) of Zhou\\", with a reading of yi as \\"remnant; leftover\\" (cf. yijing ÈÄ∏Á∂ì \\"classical texts not included in the orthodox classics\\"). This dubious tradition began with Liu Xiang (79-8 BCE) describing the text as (tr. Shaughnessy 1993:230): \\"The solemn statements and orders of the Zhou period; they are in fact the residue of the hundred pian [chapters] discussed by Confucius.\\" McNeal (2002:59) translates differently, \\"[The Yi Zhou shu] may well be what remained after Confucius edited the hundred chapters [of the Shang shu]\\". Since the canonical Shang shu in circulation had 29 chapters, McNeal proposes, > Perhaps sometime during the early Western Han the transmitted version of the > Zhou shu was expanded so as to produce a text of exactly seventy-one > chapters, so that, added to the twenty-nine chapters of the Shang shu, the > so-called \\"hundred chapters of the shu\\" could be given a literal meaning. > This would account for those chapters of the Yi Zhou shu that seem entirely > unrelated or only tentatively related to the main themes of the work. > (2002:59) Jizhong Zhoushu (or Jizhong Zhou shu) derives from a second tradition that the text was found among the manuscripts on bamboo slips unearthed in the (c. 279 CE) Jizhong discovery of the tomb of King Xiang Ë•ÑÁéã of Wei (r. 311‚Äì296 BCE). Shaughnessy (1993:229) concludes that since \\"both of these traditions can be shown to be without foundation\\", and since all the earliest textual citations refer to it as Zhoushu, there is now a \\"general scholarly consensus\\" that the title should in fact read simply as Zhou shu. However, since Zhou shu also figures as the section of the Book of Documents, the name \\"Yizhoushu\\" has obtained broad currency as safely marking the differentiation. English translations of the Yi Zhou shu title include: *\\"Leftover Zhou Writings\\" (von Falkenhausen 1996:8) *\\"Remainder of Zhou documents\\" (Shaughnessy 1999:294) *\\"[Remaining] Zhou documents\\" (Wilkinson 2000:465) *\\"Chou Documents Apocrpha\\" (Lee 2000:477) *\\"Remainder of the Zhou Documents\\" (McNeal 2002:46) *\\"Remnants of Zhou Documents\\" (Shaughnessy 2006:58) *\\"The Superfluous [Chapters of the] Book of Zhou\\" (Theobald 2010) Content In the 1st-century BCE, the Zhoushu or Yizhoushu text consisted of 10 fascicles (juan Â∑ª \\"scroll; volume; book; fascicle\\") with 70 chapters (pian ÁØá \\"article; section; chapter\\") and a preface. Eleven chapters were lost around the 12th-century CE, and only the titles survive. The extant text has 59 chapters and a preface, with a commentary for 42 chapters attributed to the Jin dynasty scholar Kong Zhao Â≠îÊôÅ (fl. 256-266). Based upon linguistic and thematic consistencies, modern scholarship reveals that 32 chapters constitute a textual \\"core\\" treating governmental and military topics (Shaughnessy 1993:229-230). The remaining 27 Yizhoushu chapters are heterogeneous. Some describe historical events ranging from King Wen of Zhou (r. 1099-1050 BCE) down to King Jing of Zhou (Gui) (r. 544-520 BCE); supplementary chapters record topics such as astronomy (52 Shixun ÊôÇË®ì) and posthumous names (54 Shifa Ë¨öÊ≥ï). McNeal (2002:50) disagrees with Shaughnessy's claim that \\"there is no discernible organization of the text,\\" and contends, \\"there is in fact a chronological presentation of material throughout the progression of most of the chapters.\\" For instance, 18 chapter titles use one of the paired words wen Êñá \\"civil; literary\\" and wu Ê≠¶ \\"military; martial\\" (see von Falkenhausen 1996) ‚Äì a literary reference to the Zhou founders King Wen and King Wu. At least 28 of the 59 extant chapters \\"are unambiguously set in the pre-dynastic reigns of Kings Wen and Wu or during the immediate time of the conquest of Shang.\\" Date and place of composition According to Shaughnessy (1993:230), the Yizhoushu underwent two textual redactions. First, sometime in the late 4th- or early 3rd-century BCE, an anonymous editor compiled the 32 \\"core\\" chapters. These have linguistic and intellectual features characteristic of Warring States writings, and were quoted in classics such as the Zuozhuan, Hanfeizi, and Zhanguoce. Second, no later than the early 1st-century BCE, another editor, possibly the preface's author, composed a redaction with 70 chapters and a preface (modeled upon the Old Texts preface to the Shangshu). Some secondary chapters are earlier than the core and others are later. For instance, Chapter 32 Wushun Ê≠¶È†Ü uses the term di Â∏ù \\"emperor\\"; McNeal (2002:56) interprets it as \\"a late third-century BC date\\", when di came to mean \\"Emperor of China\\". Zhu Youceng (19th century :zh:Êú±Âè≥Êõæ) claimed that, though possibly not produced in the early Zhou, YZS had no features of the Warring States or Qin-Han forgery. The philosophical lineage of the Yizhoushu within the Hundred Schools of Thought remains uncertain. According to McNeal (2002:60), several schools (including one branch of Confucianism) emphasized the concept of wen and wu as \\"the civil and martial spheres of government as comprising a comprehensive totality.\\" In particular, the concept was highlighted by the famous ancient military strategist Jiang Ziya or Tai Gong Â§™ÂÖ¨, who is known through the writings of Su Qin (380-284 BCE) from the School of Diplomacy or \\"School of Vertical and Horizontal [Alliances]\\". According to Chinese scholars, possible transmission line of the earliest YZS chapters went through the state of Jin and its subsequently divided territories. It is attested by the preserved textual quotes, most of which are ascribed to Jin personae. A number of thematic parallels are found between YZS and the Wenzi, which is reported to be also produced in Jin.Zhu Youceng :zh:Êú±Âè≥Êõæ, quoted by Meng Wentong :zh:ËíôÊñáÈÄö: analysis available in Luo Jiaxiang 2006Ôºö62-66. Textual history The bibliography sections (yiwenzhi ËóùÊñáÂøó) of the Twenty-four Histories provide valuable diachronic data. The (111 CE) Book of Han imperial Bibliography (Yiwenzhi) records the Zhoushu, or Zhoushiji Âë®Âè≤Ë®ò, in 71 chapters. The (636) Book of Sui lists a Zhoushu in 10 fascicles (juan), and notes it derived from the Jizhong discovery. Yan Shigu (581‚Äì645), annotating Yiwenzhi, states that of the 71 YZS chapters only 45 are extant, however, Liu Zhiji (661-721) claims that all 71 original chapters were extant. The Old Book of Tang (945) bibliography lists an 8-fascicle Zhoushu with annotations by Kong Chao Â≠îÊôÅ (mid-3rd century). The New Book of Tang (1060) lists both a Jizhong Zhoushu in 10 fascicles and Kong Chao's annotated Zhoushu in 8. The (1345) History of Song and subsequent dynastic histories only list the Jizhong Zhoushu in 10 fascicles. Shaughnessy (1993:231) concludes that two separate versions existed up until the Tang period, the 8-fascicle Kong Chaozhu Zhoushu Â≠îÊôÅÊ≥®Âë®Êõ∏ and the 10-fascicle Jizhong Zhoushu Ê±≤ÂÜ¢Âë®Êõ∏. These two textual versions were assimilated during the Northern Song period (960-1279), and the loss of 11 chapters occurred before the middle Southern Song (1127-1279). Both these traditions, associating the extant Yizhoushu to Jizhong texts or Kong's edition, have dubious historicity. First, contemporary research on the Yizhoushu has conclusively demonstrated that the received text could not have been recovered from Xiang's tomb along with the Bamboo Annals. Shaughnessy (1986:160) explains that \\"the Yi Zhou shu was extant as an integral text, known as the Zhou shu Âë®Êõ∏, throughout the nearly six centuries from King Xiang's burial in 296 B.C. through the opening of the tomb in 280 A.D.\\" Some chapters (e.g., 62 Shifang ËÅ∑Êñπ) have internal evidence of being written after the 221 BCE Qin dynasty unification (Shaughnessy 1993:232). Second, it is unlikely that Kong Chao, author of the earliest commentary, consulted the Jizhong documents. The dates of Kong's life are uncertain, but he was a close contemporary of Wang Su (195-256), and the last historical reference to him was in an imperial invitation of 266. Shaughnessy (1986:160) says Kong's commentary was added to the text \\"sometime in the middle of the third century A.D., but certainly before the 280 opening of King Xiang's tomb.\\" Histories listed many scholars ‚Äì but not Kong Chao ‚Äì who worked on deciphering the bamboo strips. Yizhoushu commentaries began with Kong Chao in the 3rd century and continue in the present day. Kong's commentary is extant for 42 of the 59 chapters, and has been included in most editions. Qing dynasty (1644-1912) scholarship produced valuable Yizhoushu commentaries and editions. The text-critical edition of Lu Wenchao ÁõßÊñáÂº® (1717-1796) was based on eight Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty versions, and includes twelve earlier Qing commentaries. The (1936) Sibu beiyao ÂõõÈÉ®ÂÇôË¶Å series reprinted Lu's edition, which is called the Êä±Á∂ìÂ†ÇÊú¨ \\"Baojing Study version\\". The (1919) Sibu congkan ÂõõÈÉ®Âè¢Âàä collection reproduced the earliest edition, a (1543) version by Zhang Bo Á´†Ê™ó printed at the Jiaxing provincial academy. Compared with most other Chinese classics, the Yizhoushu has been neglected by scholars, both Chinese and Western. McNeal (2002:46) suggests, \\"A bias against the work, perhaps originating in part from the misconception that it comprised those Zhou documents that Confucius deemed unfit for inclusion in his canonical edition of the Shang shu Â∞öÊõ∏, or Venerated Documents (which includes a section called \\"Zhou Documents\\" itself), has contributed to the relative neglect of this text.\\" Parallel texts and epigraphics The text close to the known version of YZS was known to Sima Qian: numerous parallels are found in the Shi ji account on Zhou history, and the YZS \\"Ke Yin\\" (#36) and \\"Duoyi\\" (#44) chapters are basically incorporated into the Shi ji in their full form.McNeal 2012:193-4 n. 15. The observation was made by Ding Fu :zh:‰∏ÅÈªº.McNeal 2012:92-93. Among the excavated sources on YZS: * Bamboo cash of Cili County, Zhangjiajie, Hunan (excavated in 1987) contains fairly complete text of YZS #8 \\"Da Wu\\" Â§ßÊ≠¶.McNeal 2012:82. * Fragments of Yi Zhou Shu were identified in the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips (2008). Traditional scholarly attitudes The \\"Shi fu\\" document was condemned by Mencius and ignored by Sima Qian, which is probably part of the reason it is found in the Yizhoushu today instead of the Book of Documents. Shaughnessy, \\"New\\" Evidence After its compilation, the Yizhoushu was condemned as inadequate representation of history by the traditional Confucian scholars of the late imperial period, beginning from the Song dynasty (Ding Fu, Hong Mai). Their standpoints were characterized by merging of moralistic judgement into textual criticism. Most pronounced condemnation came from Fang Xiaoru (1357-1402). Fang claimed that YZS contained \\"exaggerations\\" and \\"immoral\\" notions ascribed to the past sages (bringing \\"Shi fu\\" chapter as an example for the first, and \\"Guan ren\\", \\"Da wu\\", \\"Da ming\\" for the second). He concluded on those grounds that they could not have been authentic Zhou documents, and thus Liu Xiang's claim that they had been left over by Confucius was necessarily false.McNeal 2012:92-96. Yegor Grebnev has recently shown that the \\"Shi fu\\" chapter is a compilation of a number of pre-existing inscriptions. The organization of the chapter, the totals of captives and animals, etc., are best understood in this light, and as demonstrating an ideal of kingship far removed from the pacifist \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" ideological construction of the Zhou conquest: hence Mencius's rejection of what is probably a more authentic account.

Career In December 2005, Gould sold his first business to Bolt Media for an undisclosed amount and joined Bolt as its President. At the time of the sale, Gould's websites had 3.3 million U.S. unique visitors, according to comScore Media Metrics. While under Gould's management, Bolt's revenue grew to $7 million annually, 5.3 million U.S. visitors to their website monthly, culminating in signing a definitive agreement to sell the company for up to $30 million. Just prior to signing the $30 million definitive agreement, Universal Music Group filed a lawsuit against Bolt, MySpace and others for alleged copyright infringement. Bolt was ultimately unable to reach a settlement with Universal Music, which resulted in the termination of Bolt's $30 million acquisition, eventually leading Bolt to file an assignment for the benefit of creditors. During Gould's tenure at Bolt, he co-founded WikiYou, which raised $500,000 from investors, including Mayfield Fund, First Round Capital, and Reid Hoffman. Gould later founded GamersMedia, the first vertical-advertising network to bring brand advertisers to casual-gaming websites, which at its launch had over 20 million unique visitors across 40 sites.

As a holometabolic insect, its life cycle includes four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. All life stages are associated with the fruiting bodies of a wood-decaying shelf fungus, commonly Ganoderma applanatum, Ganoderma tsugae, and Ganoderma lucidum. Description Adults are brown, armored beetles, long. They are sexually dimorphic; males have two sets of horns and females lack horns. Males use their horns, clypeal and thoracic, to compete for mates. Unlike many species of scarab beetles that exhibit male dimorphism for horns with major and minor morphs,Emlen DJ (1996) Artificial selection on horn length body size allometry in the horned beetle Onthophagus acuminatus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).

Evolution 42: 736‚Äì749. doi:10.2307/2408865. Adult horned fungus beetles are active at night, but may be found during the day on the undersides of their host fungi. Reproductive behavior Bolitotherus cornutus adults perform reproductive behaviors on the surfaces of fruiting bodies of their host fungus. Mating pairs engage in a courtship ritual in which the male grips the female's elytra, with his thorax over the end of her abdomen. Courtship often lasts several hours, and is a necessary precursor to copulation. During a copulation attempt, the male reverses position on top of the female so that both individuals point the same direction and their abdomens are aligned. If the courtship is successful, the female opens her anal sternite and copulation takes place. Following copulation, the male remains on top, facing the same direction as the female, and mate-guards her. The male remains in this position for several hours, preventing other males from courting the female. Later, the female will deposit single eggs on the upper surface of a host fungus, then cover each egg with a distinctive dark brown oval of frass. When the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into and consume the fungus, in which they later pupate before emerging as adults. Parasites Some larvae die after attack by an uncharacterized parasitic fungus, or when parasitized by a braconid wasp, Eubadizon orchesiae, that makes a light yellow silken cocoon in the body of the larva.

Legislative history and purpose 18 U.S.C ¬ß 666 was enacted in 1984.Act of Oct. 12, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, tit. II, ¬ß 1104(a), 98 Stat. 2143 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 666). The legislative history of the statute indicates that Congress intended to eliminate a gap in the criminal statutes which made it more difficult to prosecute theft from federally funded programs: > In many cases, such [Sec. 641] prosecution is impossible because title has > passed to the recipient before the property is stolen, or the funds are so > commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot be shown. This > situation gives rise to a serious gap in the law, since even though title to > the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong > interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds. Indeed, a > recurring problem in this area (as well as in the related area of bribery of > the administrators of such funds) has been that state and local prosecutors > are often unwilling to commit their limited resources to pursue such thefts, > deeming the United States the principal party aggrieved.S. Rep. No. 225, > 98th Cong. 1st Sess. 369, reprinted in 1984 USCCAN 369. Under prior law, with few exceptions, thefts from such governments or organizations could be prosecuted only under the general theft statute, (which covers theft of U.S. government property), or the statute prohibiting theft of funds under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), . Use of the general theft statute was often precluded because either the title to the property stolen had passed from the federal government before it was stolen or the funds were so commingled that their federal character could not be shown. Consequently, Congress created a separate offense under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 666 to ensure the integrity of federal program funds administered through private organizations and state, local, or Indian tribal government agencies and to fill an apparent gap in the law that neither 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 641 nor ¬ß 665 could reach.

Early life and career Sayf ad-Din Inal was born in Cairo in 1381 to a Circassian merchant father.Van Donzel, 1994, p. 170 He was originally bought by trader Ala' ad-Din, who gave him the nisbah \\"al-Ala'i.\\" Ala' ad-Din sold Inal to Sultan az-Zahir Barquq, founder of the Burji dynasty, in 1397, hence his second nisbah \\"az-Zahiri.\\" Inal undertook military training during his service with Barquq. Following Barquq's death, Sultan an-Nasir Faraj emancipated Inal and enlisted him in his khassakiyah (\\"personal retinue\\"). Inal thereby acquired the additional nisbah \\"an-Nasiri.\\" He gained the nickname \\"al-Arjud\\" because of the scantiness of his beard. In 1421 al- Faraj assigned him the rank of jamdar (\\"master of the robes.\\") Under the short-lived sultanate of Ahmad ibn Shaykh in 1421 he was made \\"emir of ten [mamluks].\\" He was later promoted to the rank of \\"emir of drums\\" by Sultan Barsbay in 1422.Natho, 2010, p. 214 Inal continued to rise through the military's ranks, distinguishing himself as a commander, according to historian Moshe Sharon. In 1427 Barsbay promoted Inal to \\"emir of forty.\\" In 1428 he was appointed na'ib (\\"governor\\" or \\"viceroy\\") of Gaza. During his term as na'ib, Inal was praised for the \\"justice\\" of his rule by Bertrandon de la Brocqui√®re who visited the city in 1432.Sharon, 2009, p. 24 Inal had the minaret of the Kateb al-Welaya Mosque restored on 30 July 1432.Sharon, 2009, p. 162 Later in 1432, he took part in the Mamluk campaign against the Aq Qoyunlu confederation of Amid (Diyarbakir) alongside Sultan Barsbay. As a reward for his efforts in the Amid campaign, in 1433, Barsbay promoted Inal to \\"emir of one hundred, commander of one thousand\\" in Cairo. He was also reassigned as na'ib of Ruha (Edessa), a post which he reluctantly accepted, literally refusing the new assignment in the morning then relenting before the end of the day. Towards the end of Barsbay's rule, in 1437, Inal was appointed na'ib of Safad. During the sultanate of Jaqmaq, in 1442,Raymond, 2000, p. 114 Inal was appointed to the high-ranking post of dawadar kabir (\\"grand executive secretary\\") and became a member of the ruling council. In 1445 Sultan Jaqmaq made him atabik al-asakir (\\"commander-in-chief of the armies.\\") On 2 July 1450 Inal, Jaqmaq and Tamam min Abd al-Raziq, the emir al-majlis (\\"Commander of the Council\\"), were encircled by the julban on their way to the citadel. The julban demanded the release of ten mamluks recently dismissed upon Tanam's orders. Inal managed to appease them, promising the release of the mamluk prisoners. Before reaching the citadel they came across Zayn ad-Din Yahya, the ustadar (\\"major-domo\\") and a leading figure of the julban, and beat him with their cudgels forcing him to flee. The detained mamluks were freed the following day. Reign =Ascension to the sultanate= Jaqmaq abdicated the sultanate in 1453 in favor of his 18-year-old son, al-Mansur Uthman, and died later that year. Under pressure from powerful mamluks who refused to recognize Uthman's authority, Inal agreed to lead a revolt against the new sultan. On 12 March his forces besieged the Cairo Citadel, arrested all of the royal emirs and officially renounced their loyalty to Uthman, demanding the installation of Inal as sultan. The 15th-century Egyptian historian Ibn Taghribirdi noted that most of the city's residents conducted their business as usual, while some went to Rumayla Square to \\"enjoy the sight of battle.\\"Raymond, 2000, p. 169 Despite having a much larger force, most of Uthman's Zahiri mamluks abandoned their support for him by 16 March when the Caliph al-Qa'im and the top qadis (\\"judges\\") passed a resolution stripping Uthman of his executive authority.Levanoni, 1995, p. 101 Inal, at age 73, was thereby proclaimed sultan and entered the citadel later that week, capturing Uthman.Muir, 1896, p. 156 On 9 April Inal had Uthman imprisoned in Alexandria. =Internal unrest= Sultan Inal complex Inal's reign was particularly noted by historians for the severe absence of restraint among the roughly 1,000 mamluks under his direct authority,Hawting, 2005, p. 66. known as the julban or ajlab. The julban were responsible for mass disturbances throughout the sultanate.Hawting, 2005, p. 50. While Inal and his close circle of officials were notably less tyrannical and brutal than their predecessors, the transgressions of the julban created an environment of fear and insecurity. According to historian Sir William Muir, \\"for the first time both the rich and the poor had to protect their properties by trench and wall.\\" Because of the frequent raids of markets and shops, many store owners closed their businesses to protect and protest the actions of the mamluks. On 15 June 1455 Inal faced a mutiny by roughly 500 of his Circassian mamluks after assembling them to launch an expedition against Bedouin tribesmen invading al-Buhayra Province (the Delta region.)Levanoni, 1995, p. 128Muir, 1896, p. 157 Inal had rejected their requests for customary camels as a result of the poor economic conditions of the sultanate. Consequently, the mamluks rallied in Cairo's horse market, refusing to participate in the expedition. Being leaderless, the mutineers were organized and directed by the higher ranking mamluks. They attempted to assassinate Yunus al-Aqba'i, Inal's executive secretary, as he departed from the Cairo Citadel, but his bodyguards warded off the attackers, wounding a few of them. The mutineers were then joined by the recently dismissed Zahiris (the faction which Inal originally hailed from) and subsequently besieged the citadel, demanding higher salaries and the handing over of Yunus.Natho, 2010, p. 216 Afterward, Inal sent disciplinary officers to assuage the mamluks' concerns, but to no avail. The mamluks proceeded to raid Yunus's house, but were unsuccessful and returned to the horse market. There, Inal sent a herald to offer the mamluks amnesty and their wounded compensation, but they refused and severely beat the herald. After the mamluks blocked the street to the citadel preventing the royal emirs from leaving. Inal dispatched four emirs to negotiate with the mamluks, but they were taken hostage until their demands were met.Levanoni, 1995, p. 129 The mutiny convinced Caliph al-Qa'im to abandon his support for Inal and join the uprising. With the caliph providing symbolic legitimacy to the mamluks, they took up arms and assaulted the citadel. Finding himself faced with no alternatives, Inal launched an offensive against the mutineers. The Royal Mamluk Guard of the citadel resisted the rebels and eventually dispersed the Zahiris. Inal had al-Qa'im arrested and imprisoned in Alexandria. He was replaced by al-Mustanjid. All mamluks with the exception of the royal guard were removed from their positions in citadel and some of the mutineers were either imprisoned or exiled. Despite the insurrection, Inal supplied the mamluks with the camels they sought and the expedition to al-Buhayra was carried out. The young mamluk soldiers mutinied again in December 1456 demanding increased pay to which Inal bowed without resistance or punishment. Inal was generally unable to quell the countrywide unrest carried out by the mamluks. Several of the sultan's emirs were assaulted and cities and towns were raided.Muir, 1896, p. 158 Worshipers, including women, were harassed at the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As.Muir, 1896, p. 159 In one incident the sultan himself was chased and attacked with stones, forcing him to briefly flee into the citadel's harem. =Foreign policy= Friendly relations between Burji Egypt and the expanding Ottoman Empire were fostered during Inal's reign. The Ottomans' capture of Constantinople and later conquests of Serbia were well received in Cairo which hosted several festivities celebrating the Byzantine capital's fall to fellow Muslims. In addition to several visits between the gift-carrying ambassadors of the two sultanates, Inal sent his personal congratulations to Mehmet II in a poem and versified dispatch.Muir, 1896, p. 161 In June 1457 Inal sent an expeditionary force to retake Tarsus and Adana from the Karamanids of central Anatolia.Muir, 1896, p. 160 After the destructive sieges against the Karamanid cities of Caesarea and Konya, the Karamanids surrendered and dispatched an ambassador to Cairo sign a peace treaty with the sultan in April 1458. Friendly ties between Egypt and the various states of Asia Minor and the border areas of Armenia. Also in 1458, Inal received James II in the royal palace of Cairo. James was the illegitimate son of King John II and following the latter's death, attempted to wrest his father's throne from his half-sister Charlotte. Inal decorated him with a \\"robe of honor\\" and promised to install him as King of Cyprus. However, after Queen Charlotte offered a larger annual tribute to Cairo, Inal relented and issued a firman recognizing the queen's authority over Cyprus. Consequently, the mamluk guards protested and attacked the Cypriot embassy in Cairo in protest against Inal's decree. As slave-soldiers they found sympathy with James' cause, not considering him an \\"illegitimate\\" heir to his father's throne. As the uprising grew, Inal bowed to mamluk pressure and ordered the preparation of a large naval fleet to place James as King of Cyprus.Muir, 1896, pp. 159‚Äì160. The naval fleet, which carried 650 mamluks from the Royal Guard, was launched on 5 August 1460. The campaign failed to install James as king after Queen Charlotte received military assistance from Pope Paul II and the County of Savoy. Nonetheless, James managed to capture parts of the island kingdom with the mamluk force. =Public works= Sultan Inal was particularly known to be concerned with urban planning in Cairo. In 1457 Inal commissioned the construction of two hamaams (\\"public bathes\\") and a large rab (\\"communal residence\\") in the Bayn al-Qasrayn District. While these projects were underway, he decided to widen the Qasaba which had served as Cairo's main thoroughfare. In order to recede the road, he ordered the demolition of several older structures that constricted the flow of traffic. Ibn Taghribirdi commended the project, writing that it greatly benefited the general public.Raymond, 2000, p. 172 On a visit to the important Bulaq port along the banks of the Nile River on 28 March 1458, Inal was repulsed at the scene of its crowded and dilapidated buildings and structures.Raymond, 2000, p. 161 The next day he issued a decree banning construction in Bulaq and the adjacent Arwa Island, due to the narrowness of the roads there. While the royal council voiced opposition to Inal's moves, Ibn Taghribirdi, who asserted that it would ease the public's access to the port and that the rights of some individuals should not infringe on the rights of others. =Succession and death= A plague spread to Cairo in 1460, killing thousands of its inhabitants, including roughly 1,400 of the royal mamluks. Inal and his ajlab council decided to allocate the fiefs of the landowners who perished to themselves. The ajlab amassed huge quantities of fiefs, and largely held on to them until the rise of Sultan Khuskhadam in mid-1461.Hawting, 2007, p. 128. Inal was reported to be ill on 3 February 1461. Afterward he summoned Caliph al- Mustanjid and his legal scholars and conveyed to them his will that Ahmad, his eldest son and emir al-hajj (\\"commander of the pilgrimage [to Mecca]\\"),Raymond, 2000, p. 166 should succeed him. As a result. Inal abdicated the sultanate, and on 25 February Ahmad was proclaimed sultan, receiving homage in the royal Hall of Audience.Muir, 1896, pp. 161‚Äì162. On 26 February Inal died at the age of 80 after a reign of seven years and eleven months. Ahmad ruled for four months before peacefully abdicating on 28 June as a result of pressure from an alliance of powerful mamluk factions opposed to his leadership, including the Zahiris, Ashrafis, Nasiris and his own Mu'ayyadis. They were led by the Turkish Khushkadam who became sultan in Ahmad's stead.Natho, 2010, p. 217 References Bibliography   * Category:1381 births Category:1461 deaths Category:Burji sultans Category:Circassians Category:Egyptian nobility Category:Medieval Palestine Category:History of Safed Category:People from Cairo Category:15th-century Mamluk sultans ","title":"Sayf ad-Din Inal"},{"id":"36734475","text":"The Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon took place after Israel invaded Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War and subsequently retained its forces to support the Christian South Lebanon Army in Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and allied Free Lebanon Army Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon, including the capital of Beirut, amid the hostilities of the wider Lebanese Civil War. Later, Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between 1983 and 1985, but remained in partial control of the border region known as the South Lebanon Security Belt, initially in coordination with the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State, which executed a limited authority over portions of southern Lebanon until 1984, and later with the South Lebanon Army (transformed from Free Lebanon Army), until the year 2000. Israel's stated purpose for the Security Belt was to create a space separating its northern border towns from terrorists residing in Lebanon. During the stay in the security belt, the IDF held many positions and supported the SLA. The SLA took over daily life in the security zone, initially as the official force of the Free Lebanon State and later as an allied militia. Notably, the South Lebanon Army controlled the prison in Khiam. In addition, United Nations (UN) forces and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were deployed to the security belt (from the end of Operation Litani in 1978). The strip was a few kilometres wide, and consisted of about 10% of the total territory of Lebanon, which housed about 150,000 people who lived in 67 villages and towns made up of Shiites, Maronites and Druze (most of whom lived in the town of Hasbaya). In the central zone of the Strip was the Maronite town Marjayoun, which was the capital of the security belt. Residents remaining in the security zone had many contacts with Israel, many of whom have worked there and received various services from Israel. Background Blue Line, UNIFIL zone, and Litani River (2006) Although the strip was officially formed in 1985, following degradation of the Free Lebanon State and the IDF withdrawal from most of South Lebanon, it has its roots in the early Lebanese civil war. From 1968, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) controlled southern Lebanon. In 1975, the PLO's control became a severe nuisance to Christians and local residents. The Christians asked Israel for its assistance. From mid-1976, Israel began to assist the Christian residents across the border by opening the border, or Good Fence, in Metola, and through military cooperation with the Christian militia, the Free Lebanon Army and later Free Lebanon State, which was established under the Christian officer Major Saad Haddad. History =1985‚Äì2000= During the evacuation in the first Lebanon war, the command of the SLA was delivered into the hands of Antoine Lahad, who demanded and received Israeli permission to hold the Jezzine zone north of the strip. In the first years after the IDF withdrawal from the north part of Lebanon, the strip was relatively quiet. Over the years, the Lebanese militant groups, led by Sh'ite Hezbollah, increased on the Israeli side in the security belt. Driving on the roads became dangerous, and IDF forces stayed more in the military camps than on the roads. Hezbollah made many efforts to attack the IDF's military camps. On 16 February 1992, the then-leader of Hezbollah, Abbas Musawi, was assassinated by IDF's helicopter missiles. The IDF assumed that the Hezbollah leadership would curb their activities for fear of their lives and the lives of their families. Hezbollah was headed by Sheikh Nasrallah. Israeli soldiers serving in Southern Lebanon received no ribbon for wartime military service, because Israel considered the maintaining of the security belt as a low-intensity conflict rather than a war.Israeli military decorations by campaign In early 2000, Chief-of-Staff Shaul Mofaz said that 1999 was \\"the IDF's most successful year in Lebanon\\" with 11 soldiers killed by hostiles in Southern Lebanon, the lowest casualty rate during the entire conflict. A total number of 256 Israeli soldiers died in combat in South Lebanon from 1985 to 2000.Israel's Security Zone in Lebanon - A Tragedy? by Gal Luft, Middle East Quarterly September 2000, pp. 13-20 =Withdrawal from the security belt (1999‚Äì2000)= Before the Israeli election in May 1999 the prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, promised that within a year all Israeli forces would withdraw from Southern Lebanon, effectively dropping the support for the South Lebanon Army. When negotiation efforts between Israel and Syria, the goal of which was to bring a peace agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well, failed due to Syrian control of Lebanon (until 2005), Barak led to the decision of withdrawal of the IDF to the Israeli border. With the amounting pressure on South Lebanon Army and the South Lebanon security belt administration, the system began to fall apart, with many members of the army and administration requesting political asylum in Israel and other countries. With mounting attacks of Hezbollah, the ranks of the South Lebanese Army deteriorated, with reduced conscription and high rates of desertion at lower ranks. In April 2000, when it was clear the Israeli withdrawal was about to happen within weeks or months, some SLA officials began moving their families to northern Israel. The Israeli complete withdrawal took place on 24 May 2000. No Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded during the redeployment to the internationally recognized border. The South Lebanon Army however shortly collapsed, with most officers and administration officials fleeing to Israel with their families, as Hezbollah amounted pressure on the remaining units. When Israel allowed the pouring refugees in, some 7,000 refugees, including South Lebanon Army soldiers, Security Zone officials and their families arrived in Galilee. Provisional Administration The South Lebanon security belt administration was a local provisional governance body in South Lebanon, in the South Lebanon security belt areas. It replaced the Free Lebanon State institutions and operated from 1985 until 2000 with full Israeli logistic and military support. It controlled 850 square kilometres (328 sq mi) of territory in southern Lebanon. During its functioning years, the administration was headed by Antoine Lahad, a Maronite Christian claiming the rank of general. Military forces The South Lebanon Army or South Lebanese Army (SLA) was a Lebanese Christian militia during the Lebanese Civil War and its aftermath, until disbanded in the year 2000. It was originally named the Free Lebanon Army, which split from the Army of Free Lebanon. After 1979, the militia operated in southern Lebanon under the authority of Saad Haddad's Government of Free Lebanon. It was supported by Israel, and became its primary ally in Lebanon during the South Lebanon conflict (1985‚Äì2000) to fight against Hezbollah. Demographics The strip was a few kilometres wide, and consisted of about 10% of the total territory of Lebanon, which housed about 150,000 people who lived in 67 villages and towns made up of Shiites, Maronites and Druze (most of whom lived in the town of Hasbaya). In the central zone of the Strip was the Maronite town Marjayoun, which was the capital of the security belt. Residents remaining in the security zone had many contacts with Israel, many of whom have worked there and received various services from Israel. Economy The beginning of the Good Fence coincides with the beginning of the civil war in Lebanon in 1976 and Israel◊ü support of the predominantly-Maronite militias in southern Lebanon in their battle with the PLO. From 1977, Israel allowed the Maronites and their allies to find employment in Israel and provided assistance in exporting goods through the Israeli port city of Haifa. The main border crossing through which goods and workers crossed was the Fatima Gate crossing near Metula. This provided essential economic stability to the administration of Free Lebanon State and the South Lebanon security belt administration. Israel states that, before 2000, approximately one-third of the patients in the ophthalmology department of the Western Galilee Hospital were Lebanese citizens who crossed the border through the Good Fence and received treatment free of charge. The Good Fence ceased to exist with Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 and disintegration of the South Lebanon security belt administration.

In 1553, Cosimo de' Medici, Duke of Florence, fearing that the fighting in Tuscany might expand into a larger war between the Empire (Charles V) and France (Henri II), which would be severely damaging to his territories, urgently requested the Pope to send negotiators to work out an understanding.

On August 2, the French, who had invaded Tuscany under Marshal Blaise de Montluc, were defeated at the Battle of Marciano, and forced to retreat into Siena, where they fomented a coup-d-√©tat in their own interests. But the fact that Vercelli had recently fallen to Marshal de Brissac and the Duke of Savoy had been killed (August 16) gave the French, enjoying one success after another, the courage to decline to settle. The Tuscan War was just beginning.Jacques-Auguste de Thou Histoire universelle, Tome second (London 1734), Book XII pp. 366-374. Duke Cosimo of Florence requested that Cardinal della Corgna be named administrator of Spoleto to quell disturbances that had broken out there; on March 22, 1553, therefore, the Cardinal resigned the government of Perugia to become Administrator of Spoleto, on the appointment of Pope Julius III.Gulik and Eubel, Hierarchia catholica III (Monasterii 1923), p. 303. His seat in Perugia was taken by his nephew, Ippolito della Corgna. =Conclave of 1555= He was a participant in both the papal conclave of April 1555 that elected Pope Marcellus II (Marcello Cervini), and the papal conclave of May 1555 that elected Pope Paul IV (Gian Pietro Carafa).Sede Vacante and Conclave of 23 March--9 April 1555 (J. P. Adams) Pope Paul IV deprived him of the administration of Spoleto in 1555, in favor of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, one of Carafa's friends, who had administered the diocese of Spoleto under his uncle Paul III in the 1540s.Ferdinando Ughelli, Italia Sacra (editio secunda, curavit Nicolas Colet) I (Venice 1717), p. 1269. When the pope learned that Cardinal della Corgna had warned his brother Ascanio della Corgna of the pope's orders to arrest him for illicitly entering into communications with Philip II of Spain, the pope had the cardinal arrested on his way to the consistory of July 27, 1556. He was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. Following Spanish victories, the pope was forced to moderate his position and ordered the cardinal released and restored to his cardinalate duties, though the cardinal was still fined 60,000 scudi. On September 20, 1557, he opted for the titular church of Santo Stefano Rotondo. He participated in the papal conclave of 1559 that elected Pope Pius IV. In 1560, the new pope made him governor of Citt√† della Pieve.Antonio Baglioni, Citta della Pieve illustrata: Lettere storiche (Montefiascone 1845), p. 257. He served as the Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from January 15, 1561 until January 9, 1562. On May 18, 1562, he opted for the titular church of Sant'Agata dei Goti, a deaconry raised temporarily to the status of titulus. He was assigned to the Diocese of Perugia for a second time on September 6, 1564. His Vicar-General was Donato Torri.Olga Marinelli, La compagnia di San Tomasso d'Aquino di Perugia , p. 112 and n. 195. It was at this time that he founded the seminary in Perugia.G. B. Rossi Scotti, Guida di Perugia seconda edizione (Perugia 1867)., p. 22. On February 7, 1565, he opted for Sant'Angelo in Pescheria, another deaconry assigned as titulus, on February 7, 1565. =Conclaves of 1565-1566 and 1572= He participated in the papal conclave of 1565-66 that elected Pope Pius IV.Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1-14 May, 1572 (J.P. Adams) On January 30, 1566, he opted for the titular church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, and then, on March 3, 1567, for Sant'Adriano al Foro, another deaconry assigned as titulus. He participated in the papal conclave of 1572 that elected Pope Gregory XIII. As the most senior cardinal-priest residing in the Roman Curia, he opted for the order of cardinal bishops on May 5, 1574, taking the suburbicarian Diocese of Albano. Because of the new decrees of the Council of Trent forbidding pluralism, he resigned the government of Perugia at this time. Nonetheless he generously provisioned the many pilgrims who were coming from Perugia to participate in the Jubilee of 1575.Christopher F. Black, Italian Confraternities in the Sixteenth Century (Cambridge 1989), pp. 118-119. On December 5, 1580, Cardinal della Corgna opted for the suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina. During this period, he was Sub- Dean of the College of Cardinals. =Death= Cardinal Fulvio della Corgna died in Rome on March 2, 1583, at the age of 65. He was buried in the Del Monte Chapel in the Church of San Pietro in Montorio.Vincenzo Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chiese di Roma V (Roma 1873), p. 260 no. 725.

The actual form varies depending on the region, the actual mining function, and whether it is used for work or for ceremonial occasions.  Elements  At work, the miner of the Middle Ages in Europe wore the normal costume for his local region ‚Äì pit trousers (Grubenhose), shoes and miner's jacket (Bergkittel). Only gradually was the typical miner's uniform created by the addition of unmistakable elements of miner's apparel such as the miner's apron (Arschleder), knee pads (Knieb√ºgel), miner's cap (Fahrhaube or Fahrkappe, later pit hat (Schachthut), the mining tools needed for work in the pit, such as hammers (F√§ustel), chisels (Eisen), wedges, picks (Keilhauen), hoes (Kratze), shovels, crowbars, pikes (Brechstangen) or miner's chisels (Bergeisen), mallets (Schl√§gel) or carpenter's hatchets, the miners' safety lamps (often a Froschlampe), and the Tzscherper bag (for the miner's knife (Tzscherpermesser) and lamp accessories like rape oil, flint and tinder).Lexikoneintrag bei zeno.org There were specific accoutrements for the individual trade groups. The mining foreman or Steiger, for example, carried the Steigerh√§ckel, a simple hewer (H√§uer) bore a miner's hatchet (Grubenbeil). Able miners (Doppelh√§uer) carried a miner's axe (Bergbarte or Bergparte), which was simultaneously a tool and a weapon. The smelters (H√ºttenleute) wore the leather apron as a pinafore (Sch√ºrze) in front of them (i.e. \\"back to front\\") and carried various implements: the Firke or Furkel, the rake (Rechen) and the tapping bar (Stecheisen or Abstichlanze). In 1769 in Saxony, the Marienberg Bergmeister, von Trebra, introduced the wearing of the black mining habit.* p. 117 The variety of mining habits may still be seen in the mining processions typical of the old mining regions even today.

He was provost of the collegiate chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and vice-chancellor between 1251 and 1252, and bishop of P√©cs from 1252 until his death in 1280 or 1281. He was involved in lasting conflict with the canons of his see, with the archbishops of Esztergom and with other prelates. Bishop Job was a partisan of the \\"junior king\\" Stephen V in the latter's conflict with the \\"senior king\\" B√©la IV. Accordingly, Job reached the zenith of his influence in the period starting with the death of B√©la IV, when he also held temporal offices in addition to his bishopric. Life =Early life= Job was born in a distinguished family whose estates were located in the counties N√≥gr√°d and G√∂m√∂r. His parents are unknown, but royal charters refer to his two brothers named Z√°h and Ladislaus. His nephew was the infamous assassin Felician Z√°h. Job was a popular name in the 13th-century Hungary, thus his early career cannot be reconstructed. When the first certain reference was made to him in 1247, he was already provost of the cathedral chapter in Baƒç, canon at the cathedral chapter of Zagreb and the head of the royal chapel. Job was styled \\"magister\\" which suggests that he had studied in an institution of higher education. Prebendary to three ecclesiastical posts, quite unusual at that time, Job must have enjoyed a favored position in the royal court. King B√©la IV of Hungary promoted Job to the provostship of the royal Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Chapter when the incumbent, Achilles from the kindred Hont-P√°zm√°ny was appointed bishop of P√©cs in 1251. Vice-chancellorship was linked to his new position, thus Job became the head of the royal administration in the Kingdom of Hungary at the same time. =First years in the bishopric= When Bishop Achilles died in the first months of 1252, the canons of the cathedral chapter of P√©cs elected Job their bishop upon King B√©la IV's recommendation. Job soon denied the payment of the allowance of 200 marks of silver which was due to Bartholomew le Gros, a former bishop of P√©cs who in his turn submitted an official complaint against Job at the Holy See. Now Job sent two canons of his cathedral to Pope Innocent IV. He applied to the pope for the permission to get a mortgage, referring to the difficult financial position of his diocese. Although the pope permitted a mortgage of 15 Venetian marks of gold, Bishop Job sent back his canons to achieve an increase. Finally he was authorized to get a mortgage of 19 marks of gold in 1253, and at the same time the allowance payable to his predecessor was decreased to 100 marks of silver. Bishop Job needed the significant amount of money for the building of a fortress in P√©cs, which began around 1255. =Years of conflicts= Some members of his cathedral chapter criticized him for mortgaging the properties of the bishopric and turned first to the archbishop of Esztergom, next to the Holy See in 1259. However, Job deprived his opponents from their prebends in the cathedral chapter. According to a royal charter of 1331, Job was also involved into a conflict with the collegiate chapter of Po≈æega where he attempted to fill the vacancies in order to strengthen his influence over the influential ecclesiastic institution of his diocese. Job maintained a close relationship with Cardinal Stephen B√°ncsa whose relatives and followers one after another received prebends in the chapters of the diocese of P√©cs. His envoys at the council of 1263 of the clerics of the ecclesiastical province of Esztergom declared that the bishops of P√©cs were not only entitled to wear the archbispocal vestment of pallium, but were also independent of the see of Esztergom. Thereafter, the archbishops of Esztergom regarded him as being excommunicated for ignoring their authority. Bishop Job was soon involved in a conflict with the Benedictine Somogyv√°r Abbey as well. Upon his order, the abbot of Somogyv√°r was arrested and imprisoned. Bishop Job joined the party of the \\"junior king\\" Stephen V against his father, B√©la IV when a civil war broke out in the 1260s. The \\"junior king\\" entrusted the defense of the fortress of √Ågasv√°r in N√≥gr√°d County to Bishop Job, but he could not keep the fort which fell to the partisans of the \\"senior king\\" in 1264. A charter of 1346 reveals that the castle of P√©cs was also occupied under Bishop Job, probably by followers of B√©la IV. =Last years= Under Kings Stephen V and Ladislaus IV Bishop Job \\"became one of the most influential prelates in the realm\\" (L√°szl√≥ Koszta). He was appointed isp√°n of Moson County in 1272. Therefore he was responsible for the defense of a section of the western borders against the Austrians. When Austrian troops invaded Hungary in the next year, he expelled his fellow bishop Denis from the castle of Gy≈ër and made himself the captain of the fortress. The Austrians, however, besieged and took the fortress. Bishop Job tried to offer resistance in a tower but his enemies set fire on it, thus he was obliged to surrender. Bishop Job was taken in chains into Austria. The date of Job's release is unknown, but he was appointed chancellor of the realm in 1277, and isp√°n of Baranya County in 1278. The monarch also awarded Job with significant land grants, thus he became the owner of the villages Perl√°sz, Rozsozsna, Somk√∫t (in modern Pels≈ëc), S√ºv√©te and the nearby Liponok by the end of his life. The last record of him is from the summer of 1280, and a charter of 1282 refers to his former death. His death gave rise to a 13-year-long sede vacante in the diocese of P√©cs.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 15, 2012. The episode was written by Eric Horsted and directed by Lance Kramer. Plot Fry is disappointed when Professor Farnsworth misses a ceremony at which he receives a prestigious Delivery Boy of the Year award, and wishes he had other relatives he could bond with. The Planet Express crew discovers that Farnsworth's parents have moved to the Near-Death Star, an artificial satellite whose elderly inhabitants are connected to power-generating pods similar to those in The Matrix. The pods keep the inhabitants' minds entertained in a virtual reality simulation. Fry, Leela, and Bender find Farnsworth's parents, Ned and Velma (whom Fry nicknames \\"Shabadoo\\" and \\"Gram- Gram,\\" respectively), and Bender wires them into the simulation, which for them resembles a run-down nursing home. Fry enjoys meeting and bonding with the couple, but when the time comes to return to Earth, he disrupts the equipment and sets off the security alarms. Leela connects Ned and Velma directly to the group's hovercart in order to power it and escape the pursuing robot guards, and the group returns to Earth. Farnsworth's surprise at seeing his parents quickly turns into bitterness over a poor childhood, and he wants nothing to do with them. However, he spies on them as they enjoy several activities with Fry. When Leela and Amy confront Farnsworth, he tells them that when he was growing up, his parents never played with him or paid attention to his scientific discoveries (one of which involved transplanting a mouse's head onto a frog's body). The family eventually moved to a farm in the countryside, further limiting Farnsworth's ability to study, and he has never forgiven them for it. Distraught, he flees into the countryside and takes shelter at the now-rundown farm. Once the rest of the group catches up to him, Ned and Velma explain that they moved in order to protect Farnsworth from meeting the same end as their first son. That son's scientific curiosity got him into trouble on several occasions. For his sake, they first moved to the farm; he would suffer night terrors and would only be calmed when his parents read to him from science books. Later, they had to commit him to a mental institution and never saw him again. Ned and Velma claim that they did not want their second child, Floyd, to suffer this fate as well - whereupon Farnsworth realizes that they believe him to be Floyd. Hubert J. Farnsworth, the first son, was in fact committed but later released from the institution. Bender tells the group about the earlier arrival of a man named Floyd who claimed to be related to Farnsworth, but Fry tells Bender not to take the attention from Farnsworth. Farnsworth realizes that his parents never paid any attention to him because they were exhausted from dealing with his night terrors. Understanding at last that his parents have always loved him, he reconciles with them. Ned and Velma ask to be taken back to the Near-Death Star to escape the pain of their physical bodies, and Fry promises to visit. Once they are connected into their pods, Farnsworth re-programs their simulation to present the country farm in its prime and revert them to a younger age. Plugging himself in, he creates an image of himself as a child so he can play with them. The trio enjoy a game of chase as Farnsworth's mouse- headed frog hops by. Reception Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A. The episode had 1.179 million viewers and a 0.6 rating in the (18-49) demo. This tied The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in the 18-49 demo as the highest rated Comedy Central show for the night.

The building was transformed into a blockhouse when the War began and the threats of attacks by Confederate guerrillas grew. The entire block on which the fort stood was fortified. A trench lined with an earthen embankment was constructed on the perimeter of the block. The fort served as a recruiting station and the Army kept troops in Iola through most of the Civil War. These troops used the blockhouse for their barracks. At times up to 400 men were stationed in Iola.

The siege had many consequences to the political, military and social environment in the contemporary Viceroyalty of New Spain which was ruled since 1810 by Francisco Xavier Venegas. Calleja was turned from military commander of all central Mexico to the military commander of Mexico City after fears began of an insurgent attack on the capital. Morelos would continue gaining strength, reinforcing his army and taking new cities throughout the south of the country such as Oaxaca and C√≥rdoba. A further consequence came with the rise to the throne of Ferdinand VII of Spain, when Venegas was relieved of his command as viceroy in February 1813.  Context  On 16 September 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rose in rebellion, rallying the town of Dolores to fight for independence from the Spanish crown. This series of events triggered the Mexican War of Independence and various cities began to fall to the rebel cause. On 28 September of the same year, the rebel forces took over Guanajuato, on 17 October and 25 respectively, the rebels captured Valladolid and Toluca. On 30 October, they routed a loyalist army at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces, and two days later they were at the gates of Mexico City where they were eventually pushed back to the area around Baj√≠o. Loyalist soldiers under the command of F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja defeated Hidalgo's army for the first time at the Battle of Aculco, splitting the insurgents into different groups. Hidalgo's army marched towards Valladolid where various atrocities were committed against the local Spanish population. On 19 November, Hidalgo arrived at Guadalajara, which had been re-taken the same day as the Battle of Aculco by Spanish forces under Jos√© Antonio Torres, where he again took control of the city and massacred the Spanish inhabitants. On 26 November, Calleja took Guanajuato back from the rebels, forcing the rebel forces under Ignacio Jos√© de Allende y Unzaga and Juan Aldama to retire to Guadalajuara where they again conducted purges of the Spanish population. By 17 January 1811, Calleja had once again defeated rebel forces at the Battle of the Puente de Calder√≥n, after which rebel forces fled to Coahuila. On 21 March, Ignacio Elizondo, captured many of these fleeing rebels at Las Norias de Acatita de Baj√°n. After being tried, Allende, Aldama and Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez, alongside other noteworthy rebel leaders were executed on 26 June at Chihuahua. For his part, Hidalgo himself was caught and executed on 30 July. Prior to his capture and subsequent execution, Hidalgo had confirmed Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos as the commander of all rebel forces in the south of Mexico. By November 1810, Morelos had conquered most of the territory of the Guerrero. It was there that his issued the Bando del Aguacatillo, the first edict in the history of Mexico dictating individual rights. In February 1811, Morelos failed to take the city of Acapulco. He then began a campaign throughout the center of the country, taking Iz√∫car in December whilst Hermenegildo Galeana took Taxco. Marching through the mountains surrounding Puebla, Morelos reached Cuautla In January 1812.  Maneuvers  Map of Morelos' overall campaign. The viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Xavier Venegas, in an effort to avert an assault on Mexico City, sent Calleja at the head of 5,000 soldiers to hold Morelos and his forces in the area around Cuautla. Calleja fortified the area around Pasulco as he scrutinized the area around Cuautla for potential avenues of attack. Morelos, Galeana, Nicol√°s Bravo, and the larger insurgent army arrived to garrison the city on 31 January 1812. One Spanish farmer named Mateo Musitu attempted to attack the rebels with a cannon named el Matamorelos (the Morelos killer), but he was defeated by Galeana. After entering the city, Morelos promptly executed 50 royalist soldiers and gave a speech that sought to gain sympathy amongst the people with the goal of gaining supporters in his efforts to achieve a breakthrough to the capital of the viceroyalty. Leonardo Bravo began an extensive trench fortification network around Cuautla and ordered that loopholes be made in the convent and many of the principal buildings. Whilst Bravo was fortifying the town, Morelos went about procuring food and equipment for his troops. At this time, the rebel forces numbered around 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry who were commanded directly by Francisco Ayala and Colonel Cano respectively. The rebels had 16 pieces of artillery, amongst them was el Ni√±o which was property of the Galeana brothers and was used in some of the festivals thrown at Cuautla. On the morning of 10 February, the rebels learned of Calleja's arrival to Cuautla, causing Galeana to leave the fort and to fortify the town and the Convent of San Diego. Leonardo Bravo commanded the forces from Santo Domingo and Mariano Matamoros together with Victor Bravo took command over the trenches south of the town. Morelos dedicated himself to the inspection of his troops, the transportation of provisions and the watch over the northern part of the city. On 18 February, Calleja began his first attack on Cuautla with around 5,000 troops. A few days later, 7,000 reinforcement loyalists troops arrived under the command of Ciriaco del Llano and Jos√© Gabriel de Armijo from Asturias, Guanajuato, Lovera, San Luis Potos√≠, Zamora and Tulancingo. Calleja attacked the Loma de San Diego with about 500 soldiers with the goal of creating an observation post overlooking the city. Morelos observed this from the loma of Cuautlixco, half a league away from Cuautla and made an attempt to stop the Spanish attack. Matamoros and Bravo tried to dissuade Morelos, but the general won the argument by stating that his purpose was to merely test the enemy. Calleja observed the insurgent movements and prepared two cannons to repel their attack. These cannons were destroyed by the forces of Morelos, but Calleja's observation force was able to completely rout Morelos' force who retreated to Cuautla, a great many of the rebels being taken prisoner or killed. Upon hearing this news, Galeana, together with 50 insurgent soldiers launched his own battle to rescue Morelos' beleaguered soldiers. Morelos himself was almost taken prisoner, but one of Galeana's soldiers saved him and brought him back to Cuautla. At around 7:00 am on 19 February, four columns of royalist soldiers left the camp of Calvario marching in the direction of the Convent of San Diego. Two of the columns dispersed, one to the left and the other to the right to form a pincer attack on the rebel position with the other two columns attacking from the front. Each column marched with one artillery piece. The columns marched with the regiments placed on the flanks and in the center, Calleja rode to battle leading his troops from a chariot. Morelos, realizing that an attack was imminent, gave the order that the rebels were not to fire upon the Spanish troops until they had reached the outskirts of the city. He placed Galeana at the vanguard of his defensive forces.  The battle  When the realist army advanced to a position north of Calle Real, almost reaching the Plaza of San Diego, the rebels opened fire and the battle began. Hermenegildo Galeana launched his forces at the royalist attackers. A Spanish Colonel named Sagarra, upon seeing Galeana and recognizing him as one of the rebel leaders, offered single combat. Sagarra fired his pistol at Galeana, missing his target. Galeana returned fire and killed Sagarra in one shot. Galeana ordered his nephew Pablo Galeana to continue to hold the royalist forces. After some time, the insurgent position was gradually weakened and the following cry was heard: todo se ha perdido, han derrotado al general Galeana (English: all is lost, they have routed General Galeana). The rebel soldiers under the command of Captain Larios, fled to the city plaza. A troop of royalist dragoons were at one point in a position to take the city center when a 12‚Äëyear-old boy named Narciso Mendoza fired a cannon into them, dispersing them. After this period of fighting, Morelos visited each individual house that had been attacked giving money and supplies to the affected parties. It was here that Morelos realized that if he was able to decisively win this battle, it would mean that he would be free to march on Mexico City. After the failed initial attack on Cuautla, Calleja wrote to Viceroy Venegas confirming that Cuautla was defended by around 12,000 insurgents and that it was impossible to take the city with his current force and would instead opt to besiege the city. That night, he gathered a war council to discuss their options. The next day, Calleja contacted the Ministry of War with their decision, they would impose a siege on the city for a period of six to eight days. They further solicited reinforcements be sent so that they could effectively seal the city off (a distance of about a league).Parte de Calleja, (Colecci√≥n de documentos hist√≥ricos de J.E. Hern√°ndez D√°valos, tomo IV, page 35) On 22 February, a message was intercepted by the rebels which detailed the size of Calleja's force and the plans to besiege the city. After seeing this letter, Morelos decided to break out of the city but was held up by Galeana who suspected that the letter was a trick laid out by Calleja. After a meeting of the rebel leaders, they decided to remain in the city. Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, leader of the rebel forces at the Siege of Cuautla. On 23 February, Ciriaco del Llano entered Iz√∫car and managed to advance all the way to the Cerro del Calvario. From here, he mounted a series of cannon bombardments for a period of two hours directed at Cuautla. After this he sent two columns of cavalry under the command of Colonel Jos√© Antonio Andrade. The attack was repulsed by a priest, Father S√°nchez and by Vicente Guerrero. The following day, the royalists attempted a new attack that was likewise repulsed. After this attack, the royalists retreated to Iz√∫car where they pillaged and burned the neighborhoods of Santiago and El Calvario. Thereafter they commenced a new bombardment of the city center. The same day, Llano received an order from Venegas telling him to join forces with Callega at the royalist camp outside of Cuautla. After leaving behind a sizable portion of his munitions and taking a path around the Popocat√©petl Volcano, Llano entered the Tierra Caliente on 28 February. Morelos decided to delay the arrival of these reinforcements and sent a sizable force under Jos√© Antonio Galeana to occupy the Barranca de Tlayacac with orders to ambush Llano's army. These orders were changed at the last minute and the surprise force was placed under the command of Manuel de Ordiera.\\"Morelos dio la comisi√≥n que pretend√≠a Galeana a D.

Bustamante was able to surprise the rebel ambush force and routed them, allowing for Llano's forces (2,000 soldiers) to pass unscathed to Calleja's camp on the morning of 1 March.Sobre el episodio de la Barranca de Tlayacac: Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, \\"Hombres Ilustres Mejicanos\\" p√°g. 65, Editora Nacional, 1958.

Once Calleja's forces were gathered, he began his encirclement of Cuautla. The headquarters for the siege was located at the Buenavista Hacienda. The battalions from Asturias and Lovera guarded the city from the barranco de \\"Agua Hedionda\\", named as such due to its abundance of sulfuric waters. The Spanish built a bridge that stretched two leagues through this area to head off any line of escape from the city. Morelos fortified the hacienda Buenavista and the area known as \\"El Platanar\\", which was surrounded by Llano's forces. Between 1 March and 9 March, Galeana was tasked with the defense of this area. On 10 March, he was finally able to scupper the royalist forces at Zacatepec. That same day, a new bombardment of the city began and Llano was in a position to enter the city. Nicol√°s Bravo however was able to detain his forces and Matamoros made his escape from the city. On 13 March, Calleja wrote the following letter to the viceroy: ::Cuento hoy, 13 de marzo a las seis de la ma√±ana, cuatro d√≠as que sufre el enemigo como pudiera una guarnici√≥n de las tropas m√°s bizarras sin dar ning√∫n indicio de abandonar la defensa. Todos los d√≠as amanecen reparadas las peque√±as brechas que es capaz de abrir mi artiller√≠a de batalla: la escasez de agua la ha suplido con pozos, la de v√≠veres con ma√≠z que tiene en abundancia. After many months of resistance, Matamoros was able to escape from Cuautla towards Toluca where L√≥pez Ray√≥n was waiting with a variety of supplies needed to sustain the rebel defense. The rebel force was ambushed by Spanish forces and although Matamoros escaped without capture, they were unable to obtain any of the supplies for their beleaguered comrades. Spanish General F√©lix Mar√≠a Calleja del Rey, the royalist commander during the actions at Cuautla. In 1813, he would be made the Viceroy of New Spain. Calleja attempted various other assaults on the fortified city but was altogether unsuccessful. At the end of April, the situation became unsustainable and the royalist leadership asked Calleja not try to assault Cuautla again. At midday on 2 May, Calleja wrote the viceroy with his intentions to abandon the siege. That night, the insurgents decided to abandon the city. Being as the rebels were affected with a high level of disease (over half), Morelos and Galeana sent an emissary to the Spanish camp who returned with news that many of the Spaniards were sleeping and others were busy guarding the supplies. They decided to abandon the city and in less than four hours, the entire rebel army had left. Both sides inevitably claimed victory in this battle although shortly after their abandonment of the city, Morelos' army was completely routed and broken as a fighting force by the Spanish.Albi 1992.  Consequences  The insurgents abandoned the city and on the morning of 2 May, Calleja gathered his forces and occupied the city. Calleja was recalled to the capital for an interview with Venegas who offered him a temporary return to Spain to fight in the Peninsula War. Calleja refused the offer and instead decided to return to Cuernavaca which he left in December of the same year to take command of Spanish forces in Mexico City. In March 1813, Venegas was retired as Viceroy of New Spain by members of the provisional council of government in Seville. In his place, Calleja was named as the new Viceroy. From this post, Calleja directed the forces to defeat Morelos and was relieved by Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1816. Morelos and his fellow leaders were hunted down by the royalists. The rebel movement was forced to flee to the south of the country where they attempted to take the city of Acapulco de Ju√°rez, the main port connecting New Spain to the Philippines and other Spanish possessions in Asia. Leonardo Bravo was captured at the hacienda of the Terrateniente, Gabriel de Yermo and was presented to Calleja who authorised his transfer to Mexico City for trial and execution. Morelos, in an attempt to free his fellow rebel, offered a deal that would liberate all Spanish prisoners from the Siege of Cuautla (more than 200) in exchange for Bravo. Bravo was executed on 13 September at the Paseo de Bucareli with a garrote and Morelos ordered the execution all 200 Spanish prisoners from Cuautla by Leonardo's son, Nicol√°s Bravo. The younger Bravo decided instead to liberate the prisoners, giving rise to his nickname, the \\"Caudillo Magn√°nimo\\". Valerio Trujano was around this time besieged by royalist forces at Huajuapan. When Morelos was informed of this development, he marched all the way to Oaxaca to relieve Trujano. When he arrived on 25 October, Trujano had already resisted for over 100 days. with Morales' help, the rebels were able to rout the royalist forces. On 27 October, the rebels gave chase to the retreating royalist forces. Trujano was killed in this series of conflicts as the royalists were relieved by a secondary force of Spanish soldiers. Morelos gathered Trujano's forces and marched on Antequera de Oaxaca. On 25 November, he was able to occupy the city, finalizing the campaign of 1812.

It was announced at Gamescom on 15 August 2012 and released on 20 November 2013 in Australia, on 22 November in Europe, North America and India, and 5 December 2013 in Japan. The game is inspired by papercraft and Rex Crowle's drawings and doodles left around Media Molecule's office. An expanded remake of the game, titled Tearaway Unfolded, was released for the PlayStation 4 on 8 September 2015. Gameplay Players use the rear touch panel to give the effect of pushing their fingers through the game world. Tearaway is a third-person platform game which utilises almost all of the PlayStation Vita's features in some way. In one example demonstrated in the game's announce trailer, the player encounters an elk who needs a new skin. The player is able to take a picture using the PS Vita's camera and have it applied to the papercraft animal. In a gameplay demo at Gamescom, Media Molecule demonstrated how the player is also able to use the PS Vita's rear touch panel to effectively push their fingers up through the ground to interact with enemies and the environment. The player is also capable of customizing Iota or Atoi by drawing designs on virtual paper, cutting them out, and applying them to their character. In another part of the demo, the player draws on the touchscreen with their finger to cut-out a paper crown for a character in the game. The player can use an in-game camera to collect various papercraft designs, and can assist non-player characters in exchange for confetti, the game's currency. Plot The game opens with two characters (the \\"Green Man\\" and an unnamed Fortune Teller) introducing themselves to the player (referred to as the \\"You\\"). They inform the You that the world they occupy is a papercraft world called \\"ValleyFold,\\" full of \\"stories\\" that they have grown tired of hearing over and over again. They enlist the You to help them create a new story. The Green Man and the Fortune Teller connect their world with the You's, which involves blowing a hole in ValleyFold's sun to send an envelope through as an \\"invitation\\". The envelope then falls through the hole in the sun, landing in a field in ValleyFold. The envelope then becomes a bipedal papercraft humanoid (Iota or Atoi, depending on the You's choice) with the envelope as their head, referred to as the \\"Messenger.\\" After introducing the Messenger and the You to each other, the Green Man spontaneously creates the \\"Scraps\\", intended to be the enemy of the story who apparently come from the You's world through the hole in the sun, and send some after the Messenger, forcing the You to save them. After doing so, the Green Man informs the Messenger to head for the sun and deliver a message to the You. The You helps the Messenger navigate through a now Scrap-infested ValleyFold, and assist the people living there via helping them complete a ceremony involving apple-picking in an Orchard by defeating the nearby Scraps. The people then tell the Messenger to go to Gibbet Hill, a mountain that has a gigantic catapult which can help them reach the sun. After enlisting a Scarecrow pumpkin head for help, the Messenger makes their way up Gibbet Hill, the You assisting them all the while. After reaching the top, however, the Messenger finds that the sun is facing the opposite direction of the catapult, forcing the You to turn the mountain so that it faces the sun, much to the Messenger's marvel. The Messenger is then launched towards the sun on the Catapult. However, just as the Messenger reaches the sun, the Fortune Teller, having \\"heard [that story] before,\\" causes a Scrap to jump at the Messenger, forcing them to crash land on SogPort, an island that was once a part of ValleyFold that suffers from constant earthquakes. After crashing into the forest of SogPort, the Messenger encounters a baby Wendigo, a species of apex predator in SogPort, being chased by a group of Scraps. After defeating them, the baby Wendigo joins them. However, much to the Messenger's horror, the baby Wendigo is kidnapped by the Scraps just before they enter SogPort's main town. The Messenger finds the Fortune Teller in a tavern, who tells him to head to the opposite side of the island, apparently being the location of the source of the earthquakes, promising to put the messenger back on their course to the sun if they do. After navigating through a valley of Wendigos, the messenger discovers a scientific facility, which is quickly overrun by Scraps. The messenger makes their way to the head scientist's office, where she starts to inform the Messenger about the source of the earthquakes. However, just as she is about to explain, the Scraps cause a cave-in on the floor of the office, and the messenger falls into a series of caverns. There, the Messenger finds the Scraps' apparent headquarters. After rescuing the baby Wendigo from a nearby cage, the Messenger reunites the baby with its mother, who then leaves with the baby, much to the Fortune Teller's delight. After finding out that the Scraps' drilling operations are causing the earthquakes, the Messenger then heads to the lair's center, where they find a massive drill and captured scientists. The scientists inform the Messenger that they can use the drill to escape the lair, and that they need help getting to it. After some assistance from the You, the scientists and the Messenger are brought near the drill. However, the Scraps then try to attack the drill, forcing the Messenger and the You to fight them off. They are nearly overwhelmed until the mother Wendigo steps in and helps fight them back. They ultimately succeed, liberating the entire papercraft world from the Scraps, having defeated every last one. After celebrating with the scientists, the Messenger takes the drill and rides to the surface, not before being warned that the drill is powerful enough to take them \\"outside the known universe\\". The drill then takes them to \\"Between the Pages\\", a manifestation of the Green Man and the Fortune Teller's collective ideas on where to take the story next. After some thinking, the Green Man and the Fortune Teller decide to \\"Wing It,\\" and put the Messenger and the You in a desert. After some traveling, the Messenger finds a gigantic caravan. Before entering it, however, the Messenger is informed by the Green Man that it will be \\"weird\\" in the caravan, but tells them to proceed regardless. After proceeding through the caravan, they find an abandoned Messenger, their You having abandoned them. They then free the abandoned Messenger, destroying the caravan in the process. After being encouraged to by the Green Man, the messenger jumps off of a cliff and lands in the Grand Tear, a mountainous landscape with psychedelic imagery and faceless characters. After entering a portal, the Messenger arrives at \\"The You,\\" a landscape that displays the Messenger's achievements throughout their journey. The Messenger then enters another portal, taking them to the You's world, and the sun. While initially happy to see the You, the Messenger sadly and silently realizes that the sun will stay open forever, leaving ValleyFold susceptible to more potential Scrap attacks if he remains with the You. The Messenger sacrifices themself to seal the hole in the sun, leaving behind the contents of their envelope head, the message that was supposed to be delivered to the You. The game ends with the You reading the message that was delivered, revealing it to be a retelling of the game through the Messenger's perspective. Development During the early stages of development, Tearaway was called Sandpit and was open world. As such, most of the game's code still refers to itself as Sandpit. Additionally, the male protagonist Iota was originally named Oola and looked different to the female protagonist Atoi.Lawrence, Jenny (6 October 2015). \\"17 Weird Things You Didn't Know about Tearaway\\" . PlayStation.Blog. Retrieved 19 December 2015. Reception Tearaway was well received by critics, who praised its art style, creativity and inventive use of the PlayStation Vita's numerous inputs and sensors.
