It is a colorless solid that can be extracted from plant sources. Quinic acid is implicated in the perceived acidity of coffee. Occurrence and preparation The compound is obtained from cinchona bark, coffee beans, the bark of Eucalyptus globulus. It is a constituent of the tara tannins. Urtica dioica is another common source. It is made synthetically by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid. Quinic acid is also implicated in the perceived acidity of coffee.  History and biosynthesis Shikimic acid, biosynthetic precursor to aromatic amino acids, is a close relative of quinic acid.This substance was isolated for the first time in 1806 by French pharmacist Nicolas VauquelinL. N. Vauquelin (1806) \\"Exp√©riences sur les diverses esp√®ces de Quinquina\\" (Experiments on various species of Quinquina), Annales de Chimie, 59 : 113-169. Quinic acid is named on p. 167. From p. 167: \\"Concluons donc que cet acide est v√©ritablement diff√©rent de tous ceux qui sont connus maintenant, et donnons-lui le nom d'acide kinique du mot quinquina, ‚Ä¶ \\" (Let us thus conclude that this acid is truly different from all those that are now known, and let us give it the name of quinic acid from the word quinquina, ‚Ä¶ ) and its transformation into hippuric acid by animal metabolism was studied by German chemist Eduard Lautemann in 1863.Lautemann, E. (1863) \\"Ueber die Reduction der Chinas√§ure zu Benzo√´s√§ure und die Verwandlung derselben in Hippurs√§ure im thierischen Organismus\\" (On the reduction of quinic acid to benzoic acid and its transformation into hippuric acid in the animal organism), Annalen der Chemie, 125 : 9‚Äì13. Its biosynthesis begins with the transformation of glucose into erythrose 4-phosphate. This four-carbon substrate is condensed with phosphoenol pyruvate to give the seven-carbon 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) by the action of a synthase. Two subsequent steps involving dehydroquinic acid synthase and a dehydrogenase afford the compound. Derived bicyclic lactones are called quinides. One example is 4-caffeoyl-1,5-quinide. Dehydrogenation and oxidation of quinic acid affords gallic acid. Applications and medicinal activity Quinic acid is used as an astringent. This acid is a versatile chiral starting material for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. It is a building block in the preparation of the treatment of influenza A and B strains called Tamiflu. Quinic acid is also thought to displace binding of the Œº-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone.

Today, military chocolate is issued to troops as part of basic field rations and sundry packs. Chocolate rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high- energy, pocket-sized emergency ration. Military chocolate rations are often made in special lots to military specifications for weight, size, and endurance. The majority of chocolate issued to military personnel is produced by the Hershey Company. When provided as a morale boost or care package, military chocolate is often no different from normal store-bought bars in taste and composition. However, they are frequently packaged or molded differently. The World War II K ration issued in temperate climates sometimes included a bar of Hershey's commercial-formula sweet chocolate. But instead of being the typical flat thin bar, the K ration chocolate was a thick rectangular bar that was square at each end. (In tropical regions, the K ration used Hershey's Tropical Bar formula.) When provided as an emergency field ration, military chocolate was very different from normal bars. Since its intended use was as an emergency food source, it was formulated so that it would not be a tempting treat that troops might consume before they needed it. Even as attempts to improve the flavor were made, the heat-resistant chocolate bars never received enthusiastic reviews. Emergency ration chocolate bars were made to be high in energy value, easy to carry, and able to withstand high temperatures. Withstanding high temperatures was critical since infantrymen would often be outdoors, sometimes in tropical or desert conditions, with the bars located close to their bodies. These conditions would cause typical chocolate bars to melt within minutes. Logan Bar or D ration The first chocolate ration bar commissioned by the United States Army was the Field Ration D or Ration, Type D, commonly known as the \\"D ration.\\" Army Quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan approached Hershey's Chocolate in April 1937, and met with William Murrie, the company president, and Sam Hinkle, the chief chemist. Milton Hershey was interested in the project when he was informed of the proposal, and the meeting began the first experimental production of the D ration bar. Colonel Logan had four requirements for the D ration Bar. The bar must: # Weigh 4 ounces (113.4 g) # Be high in food energy value # Be able to withstand high temperatures # Taste \\"a little better than a boiled potato\\" (to keep soldiers from eating their emergency rations in non-emergency situations) Its ingredients were chocolate, sugar, oat flour, cacao fat, skim milk powder, and artificial flavoring, fortified with vitamin B1 to prevent beriberi. Chocolate-manufacturing equipment was built to move the flowing mixture of liquid chocolate and oat flour into preset molds. However, it was found that the temperature-resistant formula became a gooey paste that would not flow at any temperature. Hinkle was forced to develop entirely new production methods to produce the bars. Each four-ounce portion had to be kneaded, weighed, and pressed into a mold by hand. The end result was an extremely hard block of dark brown chocolate that would crumble with some effort and was heat- resistant to . The resultant bar was wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in a cardboard carton. Three bars made up a daily ration and was intended to furnish the individual combat soldier with the minimum sustenance recommended each day. Logan was pleased with the first small batch of samples. In June 1937, the United States Army ordered 90,000 \\"Logan Bars\\" and field tested them at bases in the Philippines, Panama, on the Texas border, and at other bases throughout the United States. Some of the bars even found their way into the supplies for Admiral Byrd's third Antarctic expedition. These field tests were successful, and the Army began making irregular orders for the bars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the bars were ordered to be packaged to make them poison gas-proof. The bars' boxes were covered with an anti-gas coating and were packed 12 to a cardboard carton, which was also coated. These cartons were packed 12 to a wooden crate, for a total of 144 bars to a crate. After U.S. entry into the Second World War, Congress planned to shut down the candy industry for the duration of the conflict, deeming it non-essential. Milton Hershey, fighting off attempts to ration sugar, corn syrup, and cocoa, let Congress know that chocolate was a vital source of nutrition for the nation‚Äôs troops. During the war years, the bulk of the Hershey Food Corporation's chocolate production was for the military. Between 1940 and 1945, an estimated three billion units of the specially formulated candy bars were distributed to soldiers around the world.\\" The D ration was almost universally detested for its bitter taste by U.S. troops, and was often discarded instead of consumed when issued.Henry, Mark R. and Chappell, Mike, The US Army in World War II (1): The Pacific, Osprey Publishing (2000), , pp. 20‚Äì21 Troops called the D ration \\"Hitler's Secret Weapon\\" for its effect on soldiers' intestinal tracts. It could not be eaten at all by soldiers with poor dentition, and even those with good teeth often found it necessary to first shave slices off the bar with a knife before consuming. Tropical Bar Hershey's Tropical bar from World War 2. In 1943, the Procurement Division of the Army approached Hershey about producing a confectionery-style chocolate bar with improved flavor that would still withstand extreme heat\\"hold its shape after one hour in 120 degrees Fahrenheit\\" for issue in the Pacific Theater. After a short period of experimentation, the Hershey company began producing Hershey's Tropical Bar. The bar was designed for issue with field and specialty rations, such as the K ration, and originally came in 1-ounce (28 g) and 2-ounce (56 g) sizes. After 1945, it came in 4-ounce (112 g) D ration sizes as well. The Tropical Bar (it was called the D ration throughout the war, despite its new appellation) had more of a resemblance to normal chocolate bars in its shape and flavor than the original D ration, which it gradually replaced by 1945. While attempts to sweeten its flavor were somewhat successful, nearly all U.S. soldiers found the Tropical Bar tough to chew and unappetizing; reports from countless memoirs and field reports are almost uniformly negative. Instead, the bar was either discarded or traded to unsuspecting Allied troops or civilians for more appetizing foods or goods. Resistance to accepting the ration soon appeared among the latter groups after the first few trades. In the Burma theater of war (CBI), the D ration or Tropical Bar did make one group of converts: it was known as the \\"dysentery ration\\", since the bar was the only ration those ill with dysentery could tolerate.Webster, Donovan, The Burma Road: The Epic Story of the China-Burma-India Theater in World War II, Harper-Collins (2004), , p. 181 In 1957, the bar's formula was changed to make it more appetizing. The unpopular oat flour was removed, non-fat milk solids replaced skim milk powder, cocoa powder replaced cacao fat, and artificial vanilla flavoring was added. It was added with the help of sugar. It greatly improved the flavor of the bar, but it was still difficult to chew. Hershey production It is estimated that between 1940 and 1945, over 3 billion of the D ration and Tropical Bars were produced and distributed to soldiers throughout the world. In 1939, the Hershey plant was capable of producing 100,000 ration bars a day. By the end of World War II, the entire Hershey plant was producing ration bars at a rate of 24 million a week. For their service throughout World War II, the Hershey Chocolate Company was issued the Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award for Excellence for exceeding expectations for quality and quantity in the production of the D ration and the Tropical Bar. Their continued efforts resulted in four stars being added to their pennant signifying the five times they received this distinction. U.S. propaganda used this product distinction during the war as a message \\"that Allied nations would win the war because of their democratic institutions, but also because of the productivity of the U.S. economy and, especially, its agriculture.\\" In tandem with this state-sponsored rhetoric, radio advertisements for foodstuffs and other consumer goods employed wartime slogans to reinforce military campaigns against Germany and Japan. Postwar to modern day The rhetoric of \\"war rations aligned food consumption with the war in Europe and Asia but also with the vitality of U.S. agriculture and consumerism. While these campaigns aimed to conserve U.S. food surpluses for the purpose of providing food aid to overseas militaries and civilian populations, they also functioned to jettison certain foodstuffs.\\" Production of the D ration bar was discontinued at the end of World War II. However, Hershey's Tropical Bar remained a standard ration for the United States Armed Forces. The Tropical Bar saw action in Korea and Vietnam as an element of the \\"Sundries\\" kit (which also contained toiletries), before being declared obsolete. It briefly returned to use when it was included on board Apollo 15 in July 1971. \\"Desert Bar\\" (Congo Bar)  In the late 1980s, the US Army's Natick Labs created a new high-temperature chocolate (dubbed the \\"Congo Bar\\" by researchers) that could withstand heat in excess of , using egg whites, giving it a fudge-like texture. During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, Hershey's Chocolate was the major manufacturer, shipping 144,000 bars to American troops in the southwest Asia theater. While Army spokesmen said the bar's taste was good, troop reactions were mixed and the bar was not put into full production. Since the war ended before Hershey's supplies of the experimental bar were shipped, the remainder of the production run was packaged in a \\"desert camo\\" wrapper and was dubbed the Desert Bar. It proved a brief novelty but Hershey declined to make more after supplies ran out.

It is served by Sydney Trains T4 Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line services and NSW TrainLink South Coast Line services. History Whilst the Eastern Suburbs Railway was not originally intended to travel via Edgecliff, the first proposal for an Edgecliff station was in 1947. In 1963 it was suggested that Edgecliff be the terminus of the first stage of the railway, but by 1967 it was decided Bondi Junction was a better terminus location. Edgecliff station opened on 23 June 1979 when the Eastern Suburbs line opened from Central to Bondi Junction.Edgecliff Station NSWrail.netEdgecliff Railway Station NSW Environment & Heritage Although not directly mentioned in projects associated with the Rail Clearways Program, work was taken out at Edgecliff as a part of the Bondi Junction Turnback project. This involved the motorisation and signalling of an emergency crossover located at the western end of the station. Previously it had not been possible to ordinarily terminate trains at Edgecliff. When completed in September 2004 it permitted trains to terminate at Edgecliff and return towards the city. This was necessary to allow the closing of Bondi Junction station while major work was carried out there but allowing the line to otherwise remain open. On 15 January 2014, a Tangara derailed just past Edgecliff. It was found that an incorrect repair had been done to one of the axles of the train in 1998/9, leading to the axle eventually breaking. During the derailment, a piece of metal, used for the edge of a concrete slab on the track, was lifted and pierced into the passenger cabin, almost injuring several passengers. An accessibility upgrade for the station was announced in September 2015. In June 2019, the new access ramp on New McLean Street was opened and the bus canopy extension completed.Edgecliff Station Upgrade NSW Government July 2019 The upgrade is now complete.Edgecliff Station Upgrade Transport for NSW 17 July 2019 Platforms & services Bus Interchange Entrance on New South Head Road in August 2007 Bus Interchange in December 2011 Upon opening most bus services travelling past the station towards the city were curtailed to terminate at the station. Despite the 1976 review that caused the design of the bus interchanges at Edgecliff and Bondi Junction to be scaled back, significant work was completed at Edgecliff to better facilitate these bus route changes: a tunnel had been dug under Ocean Street and Edgecliff Road, around the Edgecliff Post Office to New South Head Road. However, because the time savings of the train over the bus from Edgecliff were minimal and integrated ticketing was not available, fewer passengers than anticipated opted to change modes at the interchange. As initially configured, the western most platform was reserved for arrivals, with 11 stands spread across four platforms for departures with a stabling facility at the eastern end. In June 2002, the status of the interchange declined with a number of the routes that terminated at Edgecliff either cancelled or extended through to the city, operating directly via New South Head Road. It is now used only by services to the city from Bondi Junction (and vice versa) plus those from the city to the Eastern Suburbs continuing east along New South Head Road.

He was the son of Godfrey Goodman (senior) and Jane Croxton, landed gentry living in Wales. His contemporaries describe him as being a hospitable, quiet man, and lavish in his charity to the poor. Education and career Goodman was born in Ruthin, Denbighshire. From 1593, Goodman was originally educated at Ruthin School but was later sent to Westminster School, where he remained seven years under the protection of his uncle, Gabriel Goodman, Dean of Westminster. He was an earnest student and when only seventeen won a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated there in 1604 and shortly after was ordained at Bangor, Wales. Goodman's first appointment was to the rectory of Stapleford Abbotts, Essex, in 1606. He made rapid progress in the Church, and was made successively prebend of Westminster in 1607; Rector of West Isley, Berkshire, in 1616; Rector of Kinnerton, Gloucester; Canon of Windsor and prebendary of Hatherton, Staffordshire in St Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton in 1617; Dean of Rochester in 1621; and finally Bishop of Gloucester, 1624-1655. In addition, he held two livings in Wales, at Llandyssil and Llanarmon. Even as a bishop, he was allowed to retain most of these appointments. Involvement with Catholicism Goodman became one of the Court preachers and was chaplain to Queen Anne, wife of James I. His leaning towards Roman Catholicism made enemies for him at Windsor, and he was reprimanded by the King over Court sermons. A few years later, he was severely reprimanded for having erected a crucifix at Windsor and using altar- cloths with a cross design in his own cathedral at Gloucester, and further for having suspended a minister who insisted on preaching \\"that all who die papists go inevitably to hell\\". It is likely that doubts were arising in his mind about the legitimacy of the Church's separation from Rome, and he sought the society of Catholic priests who were in hiding throughout the country. He was frequently at variance with Archbishop Laud, and in 1640 refused on conscientious grounds to sign the seventeen Articles drawn up by the Archbishop. He was thereupon arrested, but after five weeks in prison he overcame his scruples and signed the Articles. This, however, availed him little, as he was soon impeached by Parliament along with Laud and the ten other signatories of the Articles and was sent to prison for treason in the Tower of London for four months. In 1643, Goodman's episcopal palace was pillaged by parliamentarian soldiers and over the course of a couple of years he was stripped of all his emoluments. He withdrew from public life to his small Welsh estate in Carnarvon, and it is likely that he converted to Catholicism at this time. In about 1650, he came to London, and gave himself up to study and research; he was befriended by some Catholic royalists and lived in close connection with them until his death in 1656. Father Davenport, O.S.F., former chaplain to Queen Henrietta, was his confessor and attended him in his last illness. He died, aged 62 or 63, at Westminster. By his will, in which he made a profession of his Catholic faith, he left most of his property to Ruthin, his native town; his manuscripts and books, however, were given to Trinity College, Cambridge.

As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at Harvard Law School, PON includes faculty, students, and staff from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University, and Brandeis University. The Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly Negotiation Journal and the monthly Negotiation Briefings newsletter, and distributes the annual Harvard Negotiation Law Review. Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.  History  In 1979, co-authors of the bestseller Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In, Roger Fisher and William Ury, along with Bruce Patton founded the Harvard Negotiation Project (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, Lawrence Susskind, Frank Sander, and Howard Raiffa, who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation. The Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution. As an umbrella organization with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations. Chair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes, and Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight.  Publications  The Program on Negotiation is responsible for multiple publications, including books, special reports, the Negotiation Briefings newsletter and the quarterly Negotiation Journal, a multidisciplinary international journal published by Wiley-Blackwell detailing the latest advances in the field. PON also regularly produces free reports that are available through their website, such as: \\"Teaching Negotiation: Understanding The Impact Of Role-Play Simulations\\", \\"Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals\\", \\"Negotiation Skills: Negotiation Strategies and Negotiation Techniques to Help You Become a Better Negotiator\\", \\"Dealmaking: Secrets of Successful Dealmaking in Business Negotiations\\", \\"Negotiation Strategies for Women: Secrets to Success\\", \\"Dealing with Difficult People\\", \\"BATNA Basics: Boost Your Power at the Bargaining Table\\", \\"Sally Soprano: Role-Play Simulation\\", \\"Harborco: Role-Play Simulation\\", and \\"Win-Win or Hardball: Learn Top Strategies from Sports Contract Negotiations\\". All of PONs publications including books, case studies, and DVDs can be obtained through the PON Clearinghouse.  Training  PON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public. = Author Sessions = The Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals. = Executive Education = Executive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table. = Harvard Negotiation Institute = Harvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations. = PON Seminars = Open to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON Seminars provide negotiation and mediation courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts. Two courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution. The Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on- site training. The Program on Negotiation also hosts a film series, and has a Graduate Research Fellowship.  Great Negotiator Award  The Program on Negotiation established the Great Negotiator Award in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors‚Äìpublic and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: Tommy Koh Thong Bee, Singaporean diplomat and Singapore Ambassador-at-large; Juan Manuel Santos, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and President of Colombia (2017); Martti Ahtisaari, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and former President of Finland (2010); Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the artists who created The Gates in Central Park (2008); Bruce Wasserstein, Chairman and CEO of Lazard, an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); Sadako Ogata, former United Nations high commissioner for refugees (2005); Richard Holbrooke, former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); Stuart Eizenstat, former U.S. ambassador to the European Union (2003); Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations‚Äô special envoy for Afghanistan (2002); Charlene Barshefsky, U.S. trade representative in the second Clinton administration (2001); and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell for his work in Northern Ireland (2000).

He was also a television producer.Obituary, The Times, London, 15 February 2010.Obituary, The Independent, London, 3 April 2010. Early life McCallum's father, John Neil McCallum Sr., was a theatre owner and entrepreneur, who built and for many years ran the 2,000 seat Cremorne Theatre on the banks of the Brisbane River. After emigrating from Scotland, McCallum Snr. became an accomplished musician, and was soon heavily involved in Brisbane's entertainment scene. His mother was an accomplished amateur actress who was born in England. In 1918, McCallum Jr. was born in Brisbane during the opening night of a comedy performance. After his birth, a family friend sent his father a wire: 'Congratulations on two howling successes'. McCallum was exposed to acting at a young age: his early childhood was full of backstage encounters at the Cremorne with the wide variety of performers who frequented his father's theatre. Although McCallum and his two younger brothers received their primary school education in the UK, the family returned to Australia once the Great Depression started. His secondary education was at the Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane. His early theatrical training was with Barbara Sisely at the Brisbane Repertory Company. Britain He later did two years at RADA in London under Kenneth Barnes and his sisters Violet and Irene Vanburgh. From there he went into repertory at Tonbridge and Northampton. In 1939 he did a season at Stratford-upon-Avon playing small roles and understudying. From there he moved to similar roles at the Old Vic under Harley Granville-Barker in which he appeared in the historic 1939 production of King Lear which featured Jack Hawkins with Peggy Ashcroft, Fay Compton and Cathleen Nesbitt. Second World War ‚Äì Australia McCallum returned to Australia shortly afterwards to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for the duration of World War II, in which he served in New Guinea. After the war he joined the J. C. Williamson company for a while, working with Gladys Moncrieff in The Maid of the Mountains. He appeared in the Australian film A Son Is Born (1946) which also starred Muriel Steinbeck and Ron Randell. Return to Britain Because there were limited theatrical choices in Australia, McCallum returned to Britain. He tested for a small part in The Root of All Evil (1947) and was given the second male lead. He was also in The Loves of Joanna Godden (1947) and It Always Rains on Sunday (1947). Both starred Googie Withers, whom McCallum married in 1948. McCallum then made The Calendar (1948); Miranda (1948), a popular comedy with Glynis Johns and Withers; A Boy, a Girl and a Bike (1948), directed by fellow Australian Ralph Smart; The Woman in Question (1950) with Jean Kent and Dirk Bogarde; Valley of Eagles (1951); Lady Godiva Rides Again (1951) from director Frank Launder; The Magic Box (1951), one of many cameos; The Long Memory (1952) with John Mills. He did two for Herbert Wilcox, Trent's Last Case (1952) with Margaret Lockwood and Derby Day (1952) with Anna Neagle and Withers. McCallum was in the biopic Melba (1953), then made Trouble in the Glen (1954) for Wilcox. He and Withers teamed for Devil on Horseback (1954) and Port of Escape (1956). He returned to Australia to play a role in Smiley (1956). He appeared with Withers on the West End stage in the play Waiting for Gillian by Ronald Millar. J.C. Williamson McCallum and hs wife Googie Withers made their home in Australia from 1958 when McCallum became joint managing director of J.C. Williamson's alongside Sir Frank Tait. McCallum was keen to encourage the casting of talented Australians in leading roles and was instrumental in beginning the starring careers of Kevin Colson, Jill Perryman, Nancye Hayes, Barbara Angell and others. Producer McCallum went into producing in association with Lee Robinson. They made Skippy the Bush Kangaroo (1966‚Äì70) which was a huge success, although a feature film based on it, The Intruders (1969) was not. McCallum and Robinson went on to produce the series Barrier Reef (1971‚Äì72), Boney (1972‚Äì73), Shannon's Mob (1976), and Bailey's Bird. McCallum also wrote, directed and produced the film Nickel Queen (1971) which starred Withers. He and Robinson went into film production with Attack Force Z (1981) and The Highest Honour (1983). McCallum continued to act during his career as a producer, on his own shows and for others. He frequently appeared on stage. A particular favourite role was in The Circle by W. Somerset Maugham. In this production he acted alongside Googie Withers in the U.K. as well as in Australia. Honours His contribution to the Australian performing arts was considerable and, in 1971, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO). Both honours were made for services to drama and theatre. McCallum was a JC Williamson Award recipient for lifetime achievement in 1999. In 1992 Googie Withers and John McCallum were founding patrons and active supporters of the Tait Memorial Trust in London. A Charity established by Isla Baring, the daughter of Sir Frank Tait of J.C.

Jarzombek has guested with a number of artists ranging from fellow guitarists Marty Friedman and Jeff Loomis to death metal outfits Obscura and Odious Mortem as well as Protest The Hero. He has also collaborated with Cynic offshoot Gordian Knot and Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler. He teaches guitar in San Antonio, TX and is a member of local Rush tribute band Exit Stage Left. Influence Ron has been hailed as one of the most influential progressive metal guitarists and has been called \\"the Godfather of Technical Metal.\\" He has been cited as an influence by numerous players, particularly from the burgeoning technical death metal scene, most prominently Muhammed Sui√ßmez of Necrophagist. Ron is also featured in the 2009 book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists by British author Joel McIver who calls Jarzombek \\"the most underrated axemonger ever‚Äù.

It was published by Crowell in 1980 and it won the annual Newbery Medal the following year. The title refers to the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Esau in the Jewish and Christian Bible, and comes directly from : \\"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.\\" The novel follows the story of the Bradshaws, a family who depends on the father, Truitt Bradshaw, and his crabbing/fishing business on his boat, the Portia Sue. Truitt's two daughters, Sara Louise and Caroline, are twins, and Caroline has always been the favorite. She is prettier and more talented, and receives more attention not only from their parents but also from others in the community. The book traces Louise's attempts to free herself from Caroline's shadow, even as she grows into adulthood. Setting This story takes place during the early 1940s on the small, fictional island of Rass in the Chesapeake Bay. Plot summary Imaginative, emotionally sensitive, and hard working, Sara Louise Bradshaw, a young girl growing up on an isolated fishing island off the coast of Maryland during WWII, is made to feel second-best from the moment of her birth. Her impoverished family consists of her rough but gentle father, always absent due to his working-class job on his oyster boat; her ladylike and intelligent mother, who had arrived on the island as a school teacher and stayed after falling in love; her grandmother, a bitter and nasty woman with a religious bent; and Caroline, Sara Louise's younger twin sister who is the main impediment of Sara Louise's struggle to distinguish herself and obtain the affection she craves. Caroline is fragile, beautiful, and admired‚Äîeverything Sara Louise is not. Caroline is offered a scholarship to a mainland school for voice lessons, due to her rare singing skills, and the rest of the family, mainly Sara Louise, must sacrifice to make this happen. To raise money, Sara Louise catches crabs with her only friend, McCall \\"Call\\" Purnell, a dumpy, short-sighted boy. One day, Hiram Wallace, the only islander to leave to go to college in fifty years, returns to the island. Hiram, whom they call \\"the Captain\\", bonds with Call over their shared sense of humor, becoming a father figure. After Sara Louise finds a local spinster from Hiram's generation (Trudy) suffering from a stroke that necessitates sending her to the inland hospital, Call, Sara Louise, and Hiram work to clear Trudy's house for her return. Hiram tells the children how Trudy may have a fortune hidden in the building, which is filthy and overrun by a starving feral cat colony. Unable to keep the cats, Hiram determines the most humane thing would be to drown them. This horrifies Sara Louise, who protests vigorously, but her friends overrule her. Unable to go through with it, Sara Louise jumps from the rowboat on the way to perform the deed and swims to shore. Call and Hiram reveal they could not bring themselves to kill the cats after Sara Louise's display, and Caroline steps in to introduce herself. Going door to door and charming the locals into taking in the mangy cats, Caroline is lauded by Call and Hiram as the cats' savior, forgetting Sara Louise's role. The island is struck by a ravaging hurricane. Sara Louise's father sends her into the storm to fetch the Captain and bring him to their home. This act saves Hiram's life; his entire home is demolished. Meanwhile, Caroline is allowed to sleep through the storm. Hiram, now homeless, moves into Sara Louise's home. A 14-year-old Sara Louise realizes she is in love with Hiram, despite his being older than her grandmother and oblivious to her feelings. Caroline mocks Sara Louise for her crush, and her grandmother begins accusing her of being a harlot and quoting scriptures at her. Caroline suggests the homeless Hiram enter into a marriage of convenience with Trudy, exchanging a place to live with living assistance, and Hiram lauds Caroline for saving the day. Eventually, the economic hardships after the hurricane result in Caroline being pulled from her voice lessons inland. As a thank you for the pleasure Trudy received from Caroline's singing, Hiram offers to pay for Caroline to attend a prestigious boarding school in Baltimore and have a private voice tutor. Sara Louise has always wanted to attend a better school, but Hiram does not offer, and there is no money to send her anywhere equivalent. She struggles with feeling of resentment and jealousy. Call enlists in the navy and leaves to join the war. Sara Louise drops out of school and takes over Call's duties, finally allowed on her father's oyster boat. Sara Louise is largely content. The hard work leaves no time for thought and, absent Caroline's shadow, Sara Louise enjoys the attention she finally receives from her family, earning her high school diploma with her mother's help. Released from needing to provide for Caroline ever again after Caroline graduates and is awarded a full-ride scholarship to Juilliard, Sara Louise awaits the return of Call to take her place on her father's boat and finally free her from her obligations to her family. Call's return at the end of the war is not what Sara Louise was expecting. Much- changed, Call announces he is not returning permanently but will attend university and marry Caroline. Staying behind to watch her grandmother while her parents travel to Caroline and Call's wedding, Sara Louise gets a wake up call from the Captain when he is the first person to ask her what she'd like to do with her life. Sara Louise confesses she would like to see the mountains and become a doctor but can't leave her family. Sara Louise eventually explodes and demands to be let go, finally expressing some of her resentment at Caroline's privilege. Her mother replies that Sara Louise was always free to go but never said she wanted to. Receiving assurance that she will be missed, Sara Louise applies to college as a pre-med student and leaves the island. She is also made to realize that her parents have always paid more attention to Caroline in part because they believed Caroline to be the weaker, not the better, of the two girls. Denied entry to medical school due to her gender and the influx of GI Bill students, Sara Louise graduates as a nurse. She then goes to work in a small Appalachian Mountains town as a nurse and midwife. She thrives and marries a widowed father. Sara Louise has a baby boy, Caroline is debuting as an opera singer in New Haven, their father and grandmother die, and their mother leaves the island permanently. On a snowy winter night, Sara Louise assists in delivering twins. The mother has the first one, a boy, safely. When the second one comes out, it is a small and cold girl. Since she doesn't have an incubator, Sara Louise rushes the baby to the fireside and much effort is made to revive her. She then realizes the boy has been forgotten and tells the mother to breastfeed him. Lactating from her own child, Sara Louise breastfeeds the younger twin. Characters *Sara Louise Bradshaw Sara Louise helps her father through the crabbing season. She is a few minutes older than her twin sister, Caroline. As she grows older, she becomes frustrated with the unceasing attention Caroline receives and attempts to become more feminine ‚Äî to no avail. After growing up in the oppressive situation of playing second-fiddle to Caroline, she eventually leaves the island to move to a small town in the mountains that she has always wanted to see. *Caroline Bradshaw Caroline is perfect. While she and Sara Louise are twins, she is considered the \\"miracle child\\" because she was near death during birth. She is an amazing singer and pianist, and she is considered more intelligent and feminine than Sara Louise. Caroline tends to tease her sister, making up the nickname \\"Wheeze\\", which Sara Louise despises. She went to a music school after she graduated from high school on her home island, then goes to Juilliard in New York. She marries McCall Purnell, Sara Louise's longtime friend. *McCall Purnell McCall, also known as Call, is a boy who works on the waters with Sara Louise because his father died. He works with the Captain after he arrives. He ends up going to war, and when he comes back to Rass, he marries Caroline. *Hiram Wallace Also known as \\"The Captain\\", Hiram is an old man that used to live on the island as a boy but moved away. He comes back and befriends Call and Sara Louise. She falls in love with him. *Susan Bradshaw Susan is Sara Louise and Caroline's mother and Truitt's wife. She is an educated woman who used to be a teacher. *Grandma Bradshaw A very religious woman, Grandma can be strict and hard to get along with. She loves the Lord, but hates the water. She believes the Captain is a heathen. *Truitt Bradshaw Truitt is Sara Louise and Caroline's father and Susan's husband. He is a waterman and war veteran. *Auntie (Trudy) Braxton Auntie is an elderly, eccentric neighbor of the Bradshaws. She lives with a feral cat colony. After she suffers a stroke, The Captain moves in with her, and eventually marries her. Reception Jacob Have I Loved received favorable reviews. Booklist called it \\"an intense, moving portrayal\\" and Carol Katz concluded for School Library Journal (copyright 2010), \\"All libraries will benefit from owning this outstanding telling of a remarkable tale.\\"Summary Reviews. Patricia Liddie wrote for The ALAN Review, \\"This novel is indeed a classic, and the beauty of it is that it's so readable for and appropriate to the older junior-high student.\\" According to Kirkus Reviews, \\"Paterson has to get into [Louise's] later years to make the point, and to avoid the instant realizations that substitute in too many juvenile novels. However, this tends to flatten the tone and blur the shape of the novel. Louise's earlier, intense feelings evoke recognition and sympathy, but this hasn't the resonant clarity of Bridge to Terabithia or The Great Gilly Hopkins.\\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote, \\"The story has a logical, but rather speeded, happy ending, but this minor flaw does not keep Jacob Have I Loved from being an unforgettable book.\\" In 2012 Jacob Have I Loved was ranked number 43 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal ‚Äì the second of three Paterson novels in the top 100. Adaptation The novel was adapted into a 1989 television film starring Bridget Fonda, Jenny Robertson, and John Kellog broadcast as an episode of the anthology series WonderWorks.

The reagent is incubated with the sample and absorbance of the product form after a series of oxidation reactions is then measured at a wavelength of 560 nm. The reagent itself is an aqueous solution of ferrous ammonium sulfate, sorbitol, sulfuric acid and xylenol orange.  Use as an assay  As an example for one of its uses, the FOX reagent can be an effective assay for the detections of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) in plant tissues from different fruits and vegetables. The FOX assay relies on the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in acidic conditions. After this initial oxidation, the xylenol orange within the assay is also oxidized to produce the product that has the 560 nm absorbance via colorimetric determination. The method itself is practical because of its relative cheapness and because the FOX reagent is not influenced by environmental factors, such as oxygen or light levels. The assay would also allow for the immediate detection of any amount of LOOHs. With the sensing of LOOHs, the FOX reagent only senses the first products of fatty acid oxidation, and is quiet useful prior to the processing of fruits and vegetables. This sensitiveness of the reagent couples well with the rapid detection of the assay. This is advantageous over other assays in which more advanced oxidation would need to proceed in order to be detected by the reagents used for the chosen assay. Recent uses of the assay involve modifications in which the assay can be used to detect the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which can be found in insect and human cells. Modifying the assay can also aid in the detection of protein, as well as lipid, hydroperoxide in human cells. Aside from its use in vegetation, the FOX assay has also been used to detect the LOOHs present within animal tissue. Specifically, it can be used in order to detect fatty acid oxidation in poultry, such as cooked and uncooked chicken. Since lipid oxidation in chicken tissue may result in the build up of toxins and the loss of flavor, early detection via the FOX assay would allow proper evaluation of the quality of meat produced.

The system currently consists of seven routes and is funded by local businesses. It was created when Wilsonville petitioned to withdraw from the TriMet service district in the late 1980s. Offices of the agency are in the former city hall off Wilsonville Road.Kulla, Josh. Out with the old, in with the new. Wilsonville Spokesman, December 12, 2007. History After complaints from local business owners who felt they were having to pay too much in payroll tax to support the regional transit agency, TriMet, with little or no bus service being provided in exchange, the city decided to file a formal petition to withdraw from the TriMet district.Federman, Stan (December 1, 1988). \\"Tri-Met approves withdrawal of three communities\\". The Oregonian. Such withdrawals were allowed, if the municipality met certain conditions, under a law enacted by the Oregon Legislature in 1987. Wilsonville's petition to withdraw from the TriMet district was approved by the transit agency's board on November 30, 1988, and the withdrawal took effect on January 1, 1989. A condition of the TriMet ordinance permitting the withdrawal was that Wilsonville had to provide replacement transit service for at least one year. The change enabled the city to reduce the rate of the payroll tax levied on area businesses for transit from 0.6 percent to 0.3 percent. Initially, the city provided the required replacement service by contracting with TriMet, which in turn contracted with Buck Ambulance to give service with vans.Brinkley, Pam (January 15, 1990). \\"Bus system may grow into WART\\". The Oregonian. p. B2. However, Wilsonville later prepared to begin managing the service directly and to increase marketing of it, in hopes of improving ridership. Minibus on route 2X-Barbur In 1990, the city council approved naming the Wilsonville bus system WART, for Wilsonville Area Rapid Transit.Brinkley, Pam (January 19, 1990). \\"Wilsonville names bus line WART\\". The Oregonian. Aware that the name was likely to inspire a few jokes, city officials proposed using a leaping frog in a new logo to be created, in order to show they had a sense of humor. The service was free at all times. In 1993, following a city-sponsored contest to rename the transit system, the city council approved changing WART to SMART, or South Metro Area Rapid Transit. The first full-size buses were put into service later the same year.\\"Wilsonville looks Smart, gives new name to transit system\\" (June 24, 1993). The Oregonian. Most service until then was dial-a-ride, door-to-door service. Following the acquisition of five used full-size buses, SMART introduced a new fixed route, 201, connecting Wilsonville with TriMet service at the regional agency's Tualatin Park-and-Ride lot and its Barbur Boulevard Transit Center, on November 1, 1993, and this was followed by the launching of a route to Oregon City (route 202), connecting with other TriMet routes there.Grund, John M.

On August 5, 2013, SMART began operating route 8X, an express route connecting the Wilsonville Transit Center with TriMet's Beaverton Transit Center via Interstate 5 and Highway 217. Because the WES commuter rail service connects the same two points, route 8X only had one trip per day in each direction (from Wilsonville at 5:20 a.m. and from Beaverton at 10:05 p.m.), and was intended to provide service at times when WES did not operate.

However, it is noteworthy that three other express routes (delineated with the suffix 'X') go well beyond the city limits (and the entities who pay for the service). Route 1X goes south on I-5 all the way to Salem, where riders can transfer to Salem-Keizer Transit (Cherriots) and operations are shared with Cherriots; the 2X heads North to Tualatin where riders can connect to TriMet; and Route 3X goes southeast to the city of Canby, connecting with Canby Area Transit. Routes 4, 5, 6, and 7 only serve Wilsonville, but Route 5 connects with TriMet Route 96 at Commerce Circle, at the northern end of the city. As of June 21, 2018, a Shopper Shuttle was placed to help seniors & people with disabilities go shopping from Charbonneau and Villebois. All of SMART's routes serve the transit center SMART Central, with timed connections between routes. The system has a total of 28 vehicles in its fleet as of February 2017, including buses, vans, and a trolley-replica bus. With transfers, it is possible to use public transit to travel between Portland and Salem. Using SMART is cheaper than taking direct (and faster) Greyhound or Amtrak service. On September 23, 2019, as part of other service improvements, the 2X route, which previously ran all the way North on I-5 to the Barbur Transit Center in Portland, was cut back to only go as far as the Tualatin Park & Ride. However, the line was also made free. The current fixed- route lines: *Route 1X Salem *Route 2X Tualatin Park & Ride *Route 3X Canby *Route 4 Wilsonville Rd *Route 5 95th Ave *Route 6 Canyon Creek *Route 7 Villebois *Route C Charbonneau Shopper *Route V Villebois Shopper References External links Category:Bus transportation in Oregon Category:Transportation in Wilsonville, Oregon Category:Transportation in Washington County, Oregon Category:1989 establishments in Oregon ","title":"South Metro Area Regional Transit"},{"id":"2621789","text":"The American Red Ball Halibrand-Ford from the 1964 Indianapolis 500 American Red Ball is a moving company operating worldwide.

He is also a former professional baseball catcher and pitching coach. He began his MLB playing career in 1964 and played again consecutively from 1967 to 1976 for the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Baltimore Orioles. After retiring as a player, Duncan served as the pitching coach for the Indians, Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. Four pitchers he coached won the Cy Young Award in 1983, 1990, 1992, and 2005. He was also a member of four World Series champion teams in 1972, 1989, 2006, and 2011. Each year from 1983 to 2011, Duncan worked with former manager Tony La Russa on the White Sox, Athletics, and Cardinals. Following the 2013 season, he became a pitching consultant for the Diamondbacks. Playing career =Minor leagues (1963‚Äì66)= Duncan was signed as an amateur free agent by the Kansas City Athletics in 1963, as a 17-year-old out of Crawford High School in San Diego. In his first at-bat as a professional baseball player, he hit a home run for the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League. Duncan made his major league debut on May 6, 1964 at the age of 18, becoming the youngest player in the American League at the time. He was kept in the majors to protect him from being drafted by another team under baseball rules. Duncan returned to the minor leagues for the next two seasons, first with the Lewiston Broncs in the Single-A Northwest League in Lewiston, Idaho. Midway through the 1965 season, Rick Monday joined the team. A 19-year-old sophomore center fielder with Arizona State, Monday had led the Sun Devils to the 1965 College World Series title on June 12 and was the first pick in the first major league draft four days earlier. After the season, Duncan and Monday entered boot camp with the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego in September. The following year in 1966, Duncan led the California League with 46 home runs in 121 games for the Modesto Reds, the A's affiliate. The second pick in the 1966 MLB draft was another Arizona State center fielder, 20-year-old Reggie Jackson. He played two weeks in Lewiston then joined Duncan in Modesto in early July, and kept pace with 21 homers in 56 games. =Kansas City/Oakland Athletics (1967‚Äì72)= Duncan began the 1967 season with the Birmingham A's but, was brought back up to the major leagues in early June. When his batting average dropped to a .194 in early July, he was returned to Birmingham to work on his hitting. When his hitting showed signs of improvement, Duncan returned to the major leagues in September, along with Jackson and Joe Rudi. Athletics' team owner Charlie Finley moved the franchise west to Oakland for the 1968 season, but Duncan started the season with the Vancouver Mounties of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He was called up to the majors in June when catcher Jim Pagliaroni suffered a broken arm and went on the disabled list. Duncan went on to catch the majority of the team's games in 1968. While he possessed good defensive skills, he only managed to hit for a .191 batting average. His batting average fell further to .126 in 1969 and Phil Roof took over as the Athletic's main catcher. Duncan's hitting improved in 1970 to a career-high .259 batting average along with 10 home runs and 29 runs batted in as, he shared catching duties with Frank Fern√°ndez and Gene Tenace, who was called up to the major leagues late in the season. He also missed time due to his commitment to the military reserves. When Duncan made adverse comments about Finley during the season, the owner fired Athletics manager John McNamara in October for failing to control his players, despite the team's second-place finish in the American League Western Division. The 1971 season saw Duncan become the Athletics main catcher, as he guided their pitching staff to finish second in the league in earned run average as well as in strikeouts. Duncan was the catcher for two twenty-game winners in 1971, as Vida Blue won 24 games and Catfish Hunter won 21 games. His offense continued to improve, hitting 10 home runs by mid-season and, was selected as a reserve on the 1971 American League All-Star team, replacing Ray Fosse who missed the game due to an injury. Duncan finished the season with a .253 average with 15 home runs, 40 runs batted in while leading American League catchers in range factor. The Athletics would win the American League Western Division but, were defeated by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 American League Championship Series. 1972 would be Duncan's best season offensively as he hit 19 home runs with 59 runs batted in, although his batting average slipped to .218. He committed only 5 errors in 113 games played for a career-high .993 fielding percentage, second only to Johnny Oates among American League catchers. With Duncan calling the pitches, the Athletics' pitching staff led the league in winning percentage and in shutouts and, once again finished second in earned run average as, the team captured their second consecutive Western Division title. Despite Duncan's production, Athletics manager Dick Williams, a proponent of the platoon system, began using Gene Tenace as the starting catcher during the last month of the season. The Athletics defeated the Detroit Tigers in the 1972 American League Championship Series and then the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. =Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles (1973‚Äì76)= Although Duncan joined the Athletics in spring training, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with Finley and, in March 1973 he was traded along with George Hendrick to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Fosse and Jack Heidemann. Duncan became the Indians' starting catcher in 1973 however, he broke his wrist on June 28 and missed two months of the season. He finished the season hitting for a .233 average with 17 home runs and 43 runs batted in while leading American League catchers in range factor. He played in a career-high 136 games in the 1974 season but, the heavy workload caused his batting average to fall to .200. Duncan was traded with minor league outfielder Alvin McGrew to the Baltimore Orioles for Boog Powell and Don Hood on February 25 1975.\\"Indians Obtain Powell,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Tuesday, Feb. 25, 1975. Retrieved October 12, 2019 With the Orioles, Duncan shared catching duties with Elrod Hendricks during the 1975 season before Rick Dempsey took over as the Orioles starting catcher in 1976. Duncan was traded to the Chicago White Sox for Pat Kelly on November 18, 1976.Patterson, Ted. Day by Day in Orioles History. Champaign, IL: Sports Publishing inc., 1999. Retrieved October 12, 2019 When the White Sox released him in March 1977, he retired as a player at the age of 32. =Career statistics= In an eleven-year major league career, Duncan played in 929 games, accumulating 617 hits in 2,885 at bats for a .214 career batting average along with 109 home runs, 341 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .279. While he was a light-hitting player, he excelled as a defensive catcher, ending his career with a .984 fielding percentage. He was respected during his playing career for his defensive skills and for his knowledge of the game of baseball. In spite of his low average he hit 109 home runs, one for every 26.5 at bats. During his time with the Athletics, he first met future manager Tony La Russa, then a utility infielder with the club. Highlights *Six two-home run games, his team winning all six. *One five-hit game, including four singles and a home run against the Boston Red Sox (July 12, 1972). *A pair of four-hit games, including two doubles and two singles against the New York Yankees (May 5, 1970) and a record-tying four consecutive doubles off of Luis Tiant of the Boston Red Sox (June 30, 1975).

Coaching career  Duncan began his coaching career in 1978 with the Cleveland Indians. After a stint as a pitching coach for the Seattle Mariners in 1982, he joined former teammate La Russa, then the manager of the Chicago White Sox. From that time they worked in tandem as manager and pitching coach, joining Oakland in 1986 and then the Cardinals in 1996. Beginning in 1986, first base coach Dave McKay also began a long tenure of working with Duncan and La Russa. The three men continued to work together until the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series. La Russa retired immediately after that World Series and Duncan retired from coaching less than three months later. McKay also moved on, accepting the first base coaching role with the Chicago Cubs. Pitchers on Duncan's staffs won four Cy Young Awards: LaMarr Hoyt in 1983; Bob Welch in 1990; Dennis Eckersley in 1992; and Chris Carpenter in 2005. Dave Stewart, who had not found consistent success before signing with Oakland as a free agent in 1986, won 20 or more games and pitched 250 or more innings four straight seasons from 1987 to 1990. From 1988 through 1990, Oakland pitchers had the lowest earned run average (ERA) in the American League, and the 2005 St. Louis staff had the lowest ERA in the majors. La Russa regularly credits Duncan as being a key factor in the success of the teams he managed for over 25 years. In October 2010, Duncan signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him with the Cardinals through 2012 with an option for 2013. He took an indeterminate leave of absence from the Cardinals on January 5, 2012, to spend time with his wife, Jeanine, who was dealing with cancer. Duncan's semi-retirement effectively ended his tenure with the Cardinals. During his sixteen seasons as the Cardinals' pitching coach, the pitching staff had the third-lowest overall ERA in MLB as well as the third-lowest starters' ERA. Pitching consultant career On November 13, 2013, the Arizona Diamondbacks announced they had hired Duncan to be a special assistant to general manager Kevin Towers as a pitching consultant. \\"With Dave, he's going to set his own schedule and it will depend on what he wants to do and what he's capable of doing\\", Towers commented of his role. \\"During spring training, be available to work with pitchers, catchers and pitching coaches as they're preparing for a game. Breaking down video of pitchers we might be considering for the draft. Plus, targeting guys in our system and getting his input ‚Äì who he likes, who is close.\\" Personal life Duncan lives in Kimberling City, Missouri. He resided with his wife, Jeanine, until her death on June 6, 2013, after a battle against glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. His younger son, Chris, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and made his major league debut in 2005. Chris passed away on September 6, 2019, from glioblastoma. His older son, Shelley, was selected in the second round of the 2001 draft by the New York Yankees and debuted in the Major Leagues on July 20, 2007. Duncan has two daughters from his first marriage, Tiffany Duncan and Devannie Duncan, who both reside in Orange County, California.

As a Delegate he was a leader in the effort to gain statehood for Arizona. His non- voting status, however, minimized his influence with only 35 of the 277 bills he introduced into the House of Representatives being signed into law. Lack of a voice in the United States Senate further weakened his efforts as he managed to get Arizona statehood bills passed by the House only to see the legislation blocked in the Senate. Beyond his efforts for statehood, Smith worked to have government buildings constructed and to provide relief to his constituents affected by either man-made or natural misfortunes. His efforts to provide relief to the citizens of Arizona did not however extend to the indigenous population for whom Smith expressed great animosity. Smith was a dedicated conservative for most of his political career. This changed following his electoral defeat in 1908. As Smith campaigned to become one of Arizona's first two Senators he became a progressive. In this new role he was a firm supporter of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom initiatives. Background Smith was born on January 24, 1851 near Cynthiana, Kentucky as the youngest of seven sons to Frederick Chinn and Agnes Ball (Chinn) Smith. His family were successful farmers who also raised livestock. He and his brothers were educated at a combination of public and private schools. In 1868 Smith enrolled at Kentucky University (now Transylvania University) where he initially studied classics. After his graduation in 1872 he enrolled in the university's law school. Smith graduated from law school at the top of his class in 1876. Following his graduation, Smith worked for the Lexington legal firm of Houston & Mulligan. In 1877 he was admitted to the Kentucky bar. The same year saw him elected to a two-year term as prosecuting attorney for Lexington. After completing his term of office, Smith moved to San Francisco, California where with the assistance of his cousin, newspaperman William T. Coleman, he established a legal practice. While in California he met and married Elizabeth Rathbone. The marriage produced no children. Tombstone From California, Smith moved to the boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory. There he became one of the first attorneys in Cochise County when Judge William Henry Stilwell admitted him to the territorial bar on May 9, 1881. He established a law practice with Ben Goodrich and quickly gained a reputation with his lively courtroom style. An example of this came when a donkey located outside a courtroom window began braying while opposing counsel was making a long speech. Smith used the resulting laughter as reason to object to \\"two attorneys arguing a case in the court simultaneously.\\" In addition to his legal practice, Smith acquired an interest in a local mining operation during December 1881. To this initial stake he added three other mines during the next two years and gained a reputation as an up-and-coming mine owner. During his leisure time, Smith enjoyed fishing the San Pedro River, hunting, or spending time at the local saloons. Smith became active in Democratic Party politics during Cochise County's \\"cowboy\\" troubles. When the U.S. Federal Government threatened to impose martial law, Smith became a leader of the plan's opposition. Believing that public safety was as established in the county as in other parts of the United States, he became a candidate for district attorney in September 1882. He won his race and served a single term beginning in 1883. While he was in office he was noted for the fairness and efficiency he displayed in his duties, always presenting well prepared and researched cases. After leaving office in 1885 he returned to his private legal practice. Territorial Delegate The 1886 Democratic territorial convention nominated Smith for the office of Territorial Delegate over longer serving possibilities such as Peter R. Brady and Albert C. Baker. The same convention created a party platform calling for free silver, territorial home rule, opposition to Chinese immigration, granting territorial delegates the right to vote, and support of the Cleveland administration. Smith's opponent was the incumbent, Curtis C. Bean. During the campaign, Smith and his supporters focused on two issues. In the 1884 campaign, Bean promised to resign if a Democratic president was elected that year. He failed to keep the promise after Grover Cleveland was elected President. Second, when the Tres Alamos land claim in Cochise County was presented to the U.S. Congress for final confirmation, Bean had taken no action even though ratification of the claim had resulted in 300 settlers being displaced. Smith in turn had no political record to defend and won the November 2, 1886 election. With the first session of the 50th United States Congress not beginning till December 1887, Smith remained in Arizona practicing law until August 1887. This time period also saw him become a director of Tombstone's Grand Central Mining Company. When Congress finally convened, Smith was assigned to the Committees on Mines and Mining and Private Land Claims. He additionally served as a member of the Special Committee on the Centennial Celebration of the Inauguration of the First President. During his first term, Smith introduced 41 bills. The subjects of these bills included a request to grant Arizona Territory another justice for the Territorial Supreme Court, authorization for Maricopa county to issue bonds, twenty bills providing financial reimbursement for losses suffered due to Civil War actions and Indian depredations, and six bills that would grant right of way to railroads and water companies to cross Indian reservations. Smith's first speech from the House floor came on March 31, 1888 when he spoke against creation of a Court of Private Land Claims. The court was intended to streamline the process by which Spanish and Mexican land grants were recognized by the United States government. In the wake of the troubles caused by James Addison Reavis and his Peralta land grant fraud, Smith argued that such a court would advantage large land claimants over smaller holders. Instead of creating a special court, Smith suggested that existing local courts could instead determine the validity of land claims. When it became apparent that the Court of Private Land Claims was to be created, Smith attempted to have Arizona excluded from the court's jurisdiction by arguing the territory had less than a dozen land claims, only two of which had any validity. During course of his career, Smith regularly spoke in favor of developing water resources in the West. His first term saw the introduction of a bill to survey Arizona to identify suitable sites for storage dams and reservoirs and to reserve the land at any located sites. Another topic on which he routinely expressed his opinion was dealing with the territory's indigenous population. His views on the subject are shown in a speech he gave on February 18, 1890 when Smith said, \\"We of the West are not brutal or even unjust to the Indian, but we sympathize more with civilization than with savagery. We much desire to see the Indian improved and the white man protected. We wish to see a human being made out of the Apache Indian.\\" Toward this end, Smith advocated in his first term against increasing the size of Indian reservations, claiming much of Arizona's best real estate had already been given to \\"a lot of idle, vagabond, murderous Indians\\". As his first term neared an end, Smith received his party's nomination for a second term in September 1888. His Republican challenger was Thomas F. Wilson who argued Benjamin Harrison would win the Presidential election of 1888 and Arizona would do better with a territorial delegate of the same party as the incoming President. After reading the speeches Smith had given while in the House most Arizona settlers felt the first term delegate had done a good job representing their interests, allowing him to win an easy electoral victory. Much of the margin of victory coming from voters in the Gila River valley who agreed with Smith's opposition to the Court of Private Land Claims. In 1889, Smith began developing political connections in Maricopa County. With the rapid growth of Phoenix increasing the political influence of county, Smith purchased an ownership interest in the Arizona Gazette to ensure a friendly newspaper in the area. Professionally, Smith joined with Ben Goodrich and Webster Street to found the legal firm of Goodrich, Street & Smith. Despite the firm's office being located in Phoenix, the partners traveled the territory and practiced where there was need for their services. Finally, with Governor C. Meyer Zulick falling out of political favor, Smith took steps to distance himself. Wham robbery trial While waiting to return for the next session of Congress, Smith's new legal firm became defense counsel for the Wham Paymaster Robbery trial. The case involved the May 1889 ambush of a U.S. Army detachment transporting roughly US$26,000 in gold coins between Fort Grant and Fort Thomas. Based largely upon reports the black soldiers assigned as guards for the payroll that the robbers had fled toward the Mormon town of Solomonville, eight men had been arrested for the crime. After taking the case, Smith and his partner, Ben Goodrich, performed extensive prep work. Defendants and defense counsel for the Wham Paymaster Robbery trial The trial began in November 1889 with Judge Richard E. Sloan running a strict courtroom. Smith used his preparatory work to attack the prosecution's case. During his testimony, Major Joseph Washington Wham, who had been in command of the payroll detachment, identified newly minted coins in the safe deposit box of one of the defendants as coming from the coins stolen during the robbery. During cross examination, Smith asked Wham to separate the identified coins from similar ones borrowed from a local bank. Wham was unable to do so. Smith followed this by pointing out that U.S. Marshall William K. Meade had not gone to the site of the attack to check a claim that following the robbery the robbers had fled directly to Mexico. During closing arguments, Smith played upon the biases of the jurors and criticized the court. When Judge Sloan rebuked Smith over the criticisms, Smith feigned ignorance about the judge's concerns. It was not until Smith was threatened with a US$500 fine that the defense council backed down. At the end of the trial the defense won an acquittal. The effect of the trial to Smith's reputation lasted for years. Even though none of the defendants were Mormon, attitude of the day blamed Mormons for the robbery. Smith refused to play upon this attitude by suggesting Mormon involvement as part of his defense. As a result, the Territorial Delegate was able to count on a large portion of the \\"Mormon vote\\" for the remainder of his political career. At the same time, Smith was accused of receiving some of the stolen gold as part of his legal fees. An example of this is a Tucson Citizen cartoon depicting the defendants and defense attorneys with the caption \\"The Wham Robbers -- Which is Mark Smith?\\" Due to time demands of the Wham case, Smith arrived in Washington after the start of the 51st United States Congress. His second term saw the Territorial Delegate introduce 46 bills, two of which were enacted into law. Smith introduced bills to reduce the size of the White Mountain Indian Reservation, allowing stray cattle which crossed into Mexico to be returned without payment of a tariff, allowing foreign ownership of mining operations, and dealing with squatters on railroad land. Among the relief bills he introduced was a request to reimburse Solomon Warner US$2227.50 for hardware and gunpowder that had been taken from him during the American Civil War. On January 6, 1890, Smith introduced his first Arizona statehood bill. While it had no realistic hope for passage at that time, the introduction was timed to occur during a flurry of activity that saw six new states admitted to the Union between November 2, 1889 and July 10, 1890. By the end of his second term, only 4 of the 87 resolutions and bills Smith had introduced in Congress had been passed. Despite the lack of measurable results the Territorial Delegate had been building a reserve of congressional goodwill, particularly among Democratic members of the House. As Congress was preparing to adjourn before the elections of 1890, Smith contracted malaria and his return to Arizona was delayed till mid-October. As a result, the campaign was already in progress upon his return to Arizona. The Democratic territorial platform was similar to previous years but called for statehood, abolishing certain territorial offices, and opposition to creating of a special court dealing with land claims. The Republicans in turn had been forced to settle on George W. Cheyney, Superintendent of Public Instruction and mine owner from Tombstone, for their nominee when Nathan O. Murphy and several other potential candidates declined the nomination. These circumstances allowed Smith to win a third term but with a small margin of victory. During the second session of the 51st United States Congress, Smith attacked the growing Indian rights movement. He called the movement \\"sickening in the sight of dead friends in Arizona\\". The Arizona Delegate then used the actions of the Apache Kid to label all Apache Scouts as untrustworthy and worthless. To this Smith called for removal of the Papago people. Furthermore, he opposed providing funds for Indian schools. When it was proposed slaughterhouses be built, Smith called for clarification on whether they were for \\"the slaughter of beeves, the slaughter of Indians, or the slaughter of white people.\\" He then requested the funding bill explicitly exclude \\"beeves and white people.\\" Constitutional convention By early 1891 there was a strong statehood movement in Arizona Territory. When the U.S. Congress declined to authorize a constitutional convention for the territory, the 16th Arizona Territorial Legislature decided to correct the oversight. The hope being that if the territory had a state constitution written it would aid in the effort to win statehood for the territory. Based upon the legislature's actions, Governor John N. Irwin issued a proclamation calling for the election of 22 delegates to a constitutional convention. Smith was one of three delegates chosen to represent Cochise County, with the convention meeting from September 7 till October 3, 1891. The convention used the committee system, with Smith serving on seven of the twelve committees. He was appointed to committees on Preamble, Bill of Rights, Ways and Means, Water, Irrigation, and Reservoirs, and Rules and Permanent Organization. He became chairman for committees on Mileage and the Legislative Department. Smith opposed disenfranchisement of the territory's Mormon population by inclusion of the \\"Idaho test oath\\" which would have required all voters to swear they did not belong to any sect or group that \\"taught, practiced, or encouraged polygamy or bigamy.\\" On the issue of women's suffrage, he took no position. The proposed constitution included support for bimetallism and advocated for irrigation of public land and construction of railroads. State legislators were required to announce any personal interests they might have in an issue before the legislature and then to not vote on the matter. Women's' suffrage was limited to school elections while the document condemned polygamy. Arizona voters approved the proposed document during a December 1891 special election. Upon returning to Washington, Smith introduced a statehood bill based upon the new constitution on January 15, 1892. The bill quickly died in committee. In early February 1892, Smith was transferred from Committee on Land Claims to Committee on Territories. On March 14, 1892, Smith introduced another bill to grant statehood to Arizona. This bill passed House by a vote of 173 to 13 but died in the Senate Committee on Territories. The Republican-controlled Senate at the time not wishing to grant statehood to the predominantly Democratic Arizona Territory In between his lobbying efforts in support of the statehood bill, Smith spoke out against educational aid for Indians. He felt Indians should only be trained to be farmers and reservations should be reduced in size to open additional areas for prospecting. During the election of 1892, the Republicans selected Flagstaff attorney William G. \\"Mikey\\" Stewart to run against Smith. The campaign consisted primarily of mudslinging, with Smith's opposition claiming he drank excessively. Newspapers supporting Smith responded by focusing not upon Stewart but upon the drinking habits of Stewart's legal partner, Edward M. Doe. As Smith's drinking habits were better known than those of his opponent, he tended to catch the worst of the mudslinging. Despite this, Smith won by a larger margin of victory than his during his previous run. In addition to the election, 1892 saw the start of dissension within the Arizona Democratic Party. While L. C. Hughes had been an early supporter of Smith, Hughes desire to be appointed governor caused tensions. During the 1892 Democratic National Convention, the territorial delegation had been instructed to support David B. Hill. Hughes changed the support to Grover Cleveland. Smith responded by providing Cleveland copies of articles critical to Cleveland that Hughes had printed. Hughes was able to shift blame after a friend of his in Minneapolis, R. A. Carple, claimed to be the author of the articles. With issue apparently settled, Hughes was appointed Governor of Arizona Territory in April 1893. By October 1893, Governor Hughes had created a division in the territorial Democratic party. While Smith made no public attacks on Governor Hughes, the governor believed that Smith was working with C. Meyer Zulick to secure his removal almost as soon as his appointment was made. Once the 53rd United States Congress convened, Smith's time was consumed by lobbying for statehood and performance of routine efforts. As the session began his committee assignments were changed to Indian Affairs, Public Lands, and Territories. Smith quickly submitted an updated statehood bill that again won House approval before becoming bogged down in the Senate. With Democrats having won control of both Congressional houses during the 1892 elections, fears of Arizona sending Democrats to the Senate no longer prevailed. Instead opposition to Arizona statehood shifted to section 16 of the 1891 constitution which mandated support of bimetallism. With Arizona calling for bimetallism and the Cleveland administration dominated by supporters of the gold standard, opposition to Arizona statehood proved too great to overcome. On January 19, 1895, Smith called for a reduction of maintenance funding to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. During the final session of the 53 Congress, Smith only introduced a single bill dealing with a railroad right-of-way. Over the course of his fourth term, four of the thirty bills Smith submitted were enacted into law. Breaks in service With the Arizona Democratic party in relative disarray and fighting to prevent a split, Smith decided not to run for reelection in 1894. Smith's wife began suffering from severe health problems in 1893 and the official reason for not running was concerns for her well- being. Critics countered by claiming he was afraid of losing if he stood for reelection. Smith's inability to gain statehood for Arizona or to block creation of the Court of Private Land Claims both diminishing the Territorial Delegate's popularity. Arizona Territorial Delegate to Congress Mark Smith (c. 1899) After his term expired, Smith returned to Tombstone and resumed in private legal practice. In July 1895, Smith paid a visit to Governor Hughes in Phoenix. The visit had the effect of easing tensions and restoring unity within the Arizona Democratic party. The easing proved to be short lived and soon after the Arizona Daily Star, which was published by Governor Hughes, was accused of insufficient support of the Democratic nominee for Territorial Delegate during the 1894 election and being overly sympathetic to Republican Oakes Murphy. Smith was appointed Assistant United States Attorney in October 1895. Consequentially, he moved to Tucson in early 1896. At the beginning of 1896, efforts to replace Governor Hughes had intensified with Territorial Secretary Charles M. Bruce, Territorial Attorney General Francis J. Heney, and U.S. Marshal William K. Meade working for the governor's removal. Smith supported the new effort and while in Washington D.C. on official business during March 1896 visited the White House. When the governor was removed at the end of March 1896, Smith was credited as being a key part of the removal effort. Shortly thereafter Hughes' newspapers began an attack on Smith, accusing him of having improperly backing Republican rancher Colin Cameron for a seat on the Arizona Cattle Sanitary Commission and of having agreed to support the Gold standard in exchange for the governor's removal. Smith announced his candidacy for Territorial delegate on August 29, 1896. After Governor Franklin declined to run for the office the other candidate for the Democratic nomination was Winthorp A. Rowe, the President of the 1891 constitutional convention. Smith won the nomination on the first round by a vote of 65‚Äì30. With the nomination secured, Smith resigned as Assistant United States Attorney so he could run for office. During the general election the Republicans suffered divisions over currency issues when their party platform supported the Gold Standard. At the same time, newspapers controlled by Hughes began running stories attacking Smith. The attacks backfired and many voters still unhappy with the former governor decided to support the Democratic nominee. When election day arrived, Smith won a plurality over Republican Andrew J. Doran and Populist Buckey O'Neill. When the 55th United States Congress convened, Smith was returned to the Committees for Indian Affairs, Public Lands, and Territories. To this was added an assignment on the Military Affairs panel. This unusually favorable set of assignments was due to the friendships Smith had made during his previous terms in Congress. As a Democrat, Smith had minimal impact in the Republican-controlled Congress. His attempt to introduce legislation supportive of bimetallism was blocked and he argued unsuccessfully against the Dingley Tariff. Smith repeatedly spoke out against the Annexation of Hawaii but supported President McKinley in the buildup to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the course of his fifth term Smith introduced 22 bills. While his usual statehood bill failed to be passed, Smith was successful in gaining authorization to build a permanent capital building in Phoenix and in gaining a railroad right-of-way to the south rim of the Grand Canyon. Smith had been planning to seek reelection during most of 1898. This changed days before the September nominating convention when Smith received word that his wife had become severely ill while in Los Angeles. He immediately took a train to be with her and was accompanied by his primary challenger for the nomination, John F. Wilson, who did not wish to \\"appear as though he were taking advantage of Mark.\\" When the convention began, Smith returned and withdrew his name from consideration. After Wilson was selected as the Democratic nominee, Smith stumped for him throughout Southern Arizona. When his term ended, Smith returned to private legal practice in Tucson. He arranged for a minimal work load and spent most of his time tending to his wife. Elizabeth Smith's health continued to decline and she died on October 16, 1899. She was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. By the end of 1899, Smith began showing interest in returning to Washington D.C. as Arizona's Territorial Delegate. Wilson was proving to be a popular delegate and calls were made for Smith not to run. Nevertheless, in early 1900 Smith announced his intention to challenge for his old position. As each candidate tried to obtain delegates for the territorial convention, Maricopa county became the key battleground. The county held an election to select delegates to the territorial convention on September 1 with a county level convention held four days later. The results of the election were quickly contested, with one newspaper hostile to Smith claiming the number of votes in Phoenix's 4th wards exceeded the total number of voters in the ward. A ruling by Albert C. Baker allowed delegates from the contested precincts to be included in the election results, giving Smith effective control of the territorial convention. Wilson supporters, unhappy with the election results, selected their own set of delegates to send to the convention. The September 12 convention began with two individuals, one a Smith supporter and the other a Wilson supporter, claiming the role of temporary chairman. When the convention secretary refused to allow the Maricopa county Wilson supporters to be recognized by the convention, a fight broke out and police were called in to break up the resulting riot. Negotiations between the two camps failed to find a resolution and on the second day of the convention the two groups split with Smith supporters congregating on the east side of the convention hall and Wilson supporters on the west. At one point, Wilson decided to withdraw from the race at the convention but the candidate was convinced not to do so by his wife. By the end of the convention, each group had selected their own set of convention officers and nominees. As the campaign began, several proposals were made to correct the split by Wilson but were rejected by Smith as either unworkable or unfairly favoring the Wilson campaign. It was not until Wilson withdrew from the race on October 12 that the split in the Democratic party ended. Despite the unusual campaign, Smith still won his sixth term as Territorial Delegate. Joint statehood battle Smith was assigned to the committees on Indian Affairs, Mines and Mining, and Territories when the 57th United States Congress convened in December 1901, . Early in the first session he called for a storage dam to be built with federal funds along the Gila River arguing \\"This is an appropriation for the purpose of providing a large number of peaceful Indians along the Gila River, in Arizona, with a means of earning a living.\\" While the request came true several months later with passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act, it did not mark a change in Smith's attitude towards Arizona's indigenous population as later the same day he stated \\"the best Apache I ever saw was the one who had spent four years in the penitentiary.\\" Smith also requested additional mineral exploration be allowed on Indian lands. Most of Smith's efforts during the term went towards Arizona's campaign for statehood. He joined with New Mexico Territorial Delegate Bernard Shandon Rodey and Oklahoma Territory Delegate Dennis Thomas Flynn to introduce an Omnibus statehood bill intended to grant statehood to the three territories. Governors Oakes Murphy of Arizona and Miguel Otero of New Mexico even went to Washington to give a joint appearance in support of the Omnibus bill. After receiving a favorable committee report the bill advanced to the full House in May 1902. On May 9, Representative Jesse Overstreet of Indiana introduced an amendment to the Omnibus bill that Arizona and New Mexico territories be combined and admitted as a single state named Montezuma. Smith quickly attacked the proposed amendment on the floor of the House, arguing that Arizona and New Mexico had separate histories, financial situations, capitol buildings, and legal systems and that the two territory's habitable regions were separated by physical barriers. He concluded by claiming the purpose of the amendment was to ensure defeat of the Omnibus bill. Smith's speech was sufficiently rousing that the Congressional Report shows it received \\"long continued applause.\\" The effort Smith put into the speech then resulted in his collapse upon the House floor. After Smith was taken away, the amendment was rejected and the Omnibus bill approved by voice vote. Physicians were initially concerned Smith had suffered a stroke but were able to determine this had not happened. The collapse instead appeared to have been caused by a lack of sleep the night before, caused by Smith's last minute lobbying efforts, and the exertion of his speech. After two weeks he was well enough to travel to Kentucky to continue his recuperation. Remembering the 1900 election, Smith's associates called upon him to make an early decision on whether he would run in 1902. Smith announced he would not run for reelection on May 29, 1902. During the election he campaigned for the Democratic nominee, John F. Wilson, but did so, as noted by the territorial press, with the \\"heartiness and alacrity with which the school boy rushes to take castor oil.\\" Marcus A. Smith By the time Smith returned to work, the Omnibus bill had moved to the Senate and Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana was leading the joint statehood efforts. In June 1902 Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania had organized a coalition of Senate Democrats and a dozen Republicans large enough to ensure passage of the Omnibus bill. Beveridge instead prevented the bill from receiving a vote in the full Senate by a 6‚Äì4 party line vote in the United States Senate Committee on Territories. After Congress adjourned on July 1, 1902, Smith visited Carlsbad, Bohemia for several weeks of rest and recovery. Soon after his return to the United States, Beveridge organized a congressional fact finding trip to Arizona searching for signs the territory was not ready for statehood. Accompanying Beveridge on the three-day visit were Senators Henry E. Burnham of New Hampshire, William P. Dillingham of Vermont, and Henry Heitfeld of Idaho. The group was joined by Senator Thomas R. Bard of California during their stop in Prescott. During the lame duck session in early 1903, Smith commented upon the trip, saying \\"I met the committee -- I never could have overtaken it -- at Phoenix and it remained one day ... and 'investigated' a police judge and some census enumerators, and had an interpreter with them scouting the town to see whether some Mexicans could be found who could not speak English and prove valuable witnesses for the purpose of the investigation.\\" Hopes for passage of the Omnibus bill died as Senator Beveridge used parliamentary techniques to prevent the Omnibus bill receiving a Senate vote before the 57th Congress adjourned. When his term ended, Smith returned to private legal practice in Tucson. In February 1904, Smith went to Mexico City to defend his ownership interest of some mines in Sonora before the Supreme Court of Mexico As the election of 1904 approached, Wilson announced he would step down as Territorial Delegate. Smith accepted the Democratic nomination unopposed. During the campaign, Democratic newspapers that had once been solid Smith supporters gave him only tepid support. Republican newspapers, in turn, attacked Smith's past failures to secure statehood for the territory. The Republicans also attempted to label Smith as a supporter of the joint statehood movement. Voters did not agree with these claims and Smith won by the narrowest margin of his career. In October 1905, Smith led a congressional delegation on a tour of the territory. The tour was hosted by a variety of railroad and mining interests within the territory and ended with a visit to the Grand Canyon. Following the trip, the majority of the visiting delegates joined the opposition to the joint statehood effort. As the first session of the 59th United States Congress convened, Smith was assigned to Committees on Post Office and Post Roads, Public Lands, and Territories. Smith dealt primarily with statehood issues during the session but managed to obtain funding to build courthouses in Apache, Gila, Mohave, and Yuma counties. Upon his return to Congress, Smith found the joint statehood battle largely as he had left it. Senator Bevridge was still working to create what he called \\"Arizona the Great\\". Meanwhile, Senator Joseph B. Foraker of Ohio had replaced Senator Quay as the champion for an independent Arizona. On December 11, 1905, Foraker sponsored an amendment to a Senate statehood bill calling for Arizona and New Mexico to hold a referendum on the joint statehood proposal. The \\"Foraker amendment\\" was initially written by Smith and called for voters to answer the question \\"Shall Arizona and New Mexico be united to form one State?\\" The amendment furthermore required both territories to approve joint statehood or else the merger would be blocked. The amendment was passed into law on March 9, 1906. In August 1906, Smith attended a joint meeting of the Democratic and Republican territorial committees where the two groups decided to work together to defeat the joint statehood proposal during the referendum. The next month Smith accepted his party's nomination for an eighth term in Congress. In the race for Territorial Delegate, both Smith and his Republican challenger strongly opposed joint statehood but Smith received the majority of the credit for leading the fight for an independent Arizona. As a result, he won reelection. The joint statehood referendum in turn was defeated by the Arizona voters 16,265 to 3,141 while New Mexico voters cast 26,195 for and 14,735 against. During the 60th United States Congress, Smith introduced bills to limit the amount of federal land set aside for military use, national forests, and Indian reservations. While the Progressive Era was well under way, Smith avoided taking a position on national level issues of the day. He instead continued the battle for Arizona statehood, introducing another statehood bill in January 1908. When Smith returned from Washington D.C. in May 1908, the lack of the usual reception crowd indicated a decline in the Delegate's popularity. He however decided to still run for another term in office. Smith won his party's nomination but a challenge by Eugene Brady O'Neill resulted in a Democratic platform more reflective of the party's \\"Progressive\\" wing than Smith's \\"Old Guard\\" views. During his campaign, Smith emphasized his contributions to defeating the joint statehood proposal, aid he had provided settlers in resolving land claims and his support of reclamation projects while denying he was controlled by corporate interests. Newspapers meanwhile criticized his nomination by claiming it had been made by \\"the machine\\" and not by the majority of party supporters. On October 10, 1908, Smith announced he had received a letter from William Jennings Bryan requesting he aid the Presidential nominee during a five-state speaking tour. As a result of the request, Smith was absent from the territory during most of the campaign. It was not until October 30 that Smith returned to Arizona, by which time speculation was flying that he had foreseen his coming defeat and had manufactured the letter as an excuse. With the hope that a Republican representative could gain statehood for Arizona after Smith's years of failure, many Democrats contributed to Smiths defeat by voting for Ralph Cameron. Smith introduced his final statehood bill when the 60th United States Congress reconvened in December 1908. It failed as all its predecessors had. In February 1909, Representative Augustus O. Stanley of Kentucky gave a farewell speech for Smith that marked the territorial delegate's last day as a sitting member of the House of Representatives. New political image Shortly after his inauguration in 1909, President William Taft began work to fulfill the plank in his party's platform to grant Arizona statehood. An Arizona statehood bill introduced on January 20, 1910, was passed by both houses of Congress, and signed into law in June 1910. Smith was critical of the bill as it required both Congressional and Presidential approval of the new state's constitution. Following the October 1910 constitutional convention, Smith was initially unhappy with the resulting document. This changed at the start of 1911 and Smith became a supporter of the proposed constitution. Following voter approval of the new constitution in February 1911, Congress passed a resolution to admit Arizona as a state. President Taft refused to sign the resolution because of the constitution's provision allowing for recall of judges. A second congressional resolution allowing for statehood if the recall provision was removed was passed and signed by the President on August 21, 1911. Smith announced his candidacy for one of Arizona's two senate seats on September 24, 1911 As the campaign began, Smith abandoned his long-standing conservative stand and declared himself a \\"Progressive\\". During the primaries, questions arose about whether Smith had been in the employ of the Southern Pacific Railroad or any other corporate interests during his years as a Territorial Delegate. Smith responded on the day before the primary election with a long statement denying any such corporate involvement had ever existed. When results were counted, Smith finished first in the six-way Democratic primary with Henry F. Ashurst securing the party's second nomination. During the general election Smith called for the voters to support \\"known progressives on the Democratic ticket\\" while The Arizona Republican noted the former conservative had become a \\"radical of the most pronounced type.\\" Following the general election on December 12, 1911, Smith was annoyed that he had placed second behind Ashurst. U.S. Senate The Arizona State Legislature confirmed the selection of Smith and Ashurst as the state's first U.S. Senators on March 26, 1912. (The 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, allowing for direct election of U.S. Senators, had not yet been adopted.) The two men were sworn in on April 2, 1912. During the casting of lots to determine his Senate class, Smith was assigned to Class 3 with an initial term ending in March 1915. Following the ceremony, he expressed regret that he had drawn a shorter initial term than Ashurst. Upon his entry into the Senate, Smith was assigned to the committees on the District of Columbia, Geological Survey, Public Land, Irrigation and Reclamation, Railroads The 62nd United States Congress was in its second session at the time of his entry and, with the 1912 U.S. Presidential election approaching, the new Senator found the Republican majority split between Roosevelt and Taft supporters. As a Democrat, Smith avoided the rivalry and allowed the two sides to damage each other. He instead worked for various appropriations for Arizona projects and to have Fort Grant, Arizona converted from a military base into a state operated reform school. On national issues he voted to raise the age for U.S. Navy retirement from 62 to 70, opposed requiring a literacy test for immigration to the United States, and voted to abolish the United States Commerce Court. After President Taft nominated Richard E. Sloan as the first judge on the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Smith worked to block the confirmation. Smith's reasons for opposing the judge are unknown but may have been as much personal as they were political. During the lame duck session in early 1913, Smith sought relief funds for farmers in the Colorado River valley affected by the floods that created the Salton Sea and for displaced Americans, many of whom were Mormon, that were forced to flee from the Mexican Revolution. Smith (l) with U.S. Senators Albert B. Fall (c) and Frank B. Brandegee (r) The 63rd United States Congress brought a Democratic majority to the Senate. Smith also received a new set of committee assignments. He became Chairman of the Panel on Irrigation and Reclamation while accepting positions on the committees for Conservation of National Resources, the District of Columbia, Foreign Relations, Geological Survey, Printing, Public Lands, and Railroads. Smith recommended the United States take a stand on the Mexican Revolution before European powers invaded the country. He also suggested the United States seize Baja California to gain full control of the Colorado River. In issues directly affecting Arizona, he opposed financial support for water wells for Indians living off the reservation but joined with Carl Hayden in supporting irrigation projects within reservation boundaries. With the new Congress, Smith became a supporter of Woodrow Wilson's \\"New Freedom\\" initiatives. Smith initially called for a high tariff on wool to aid sheep ranchers in his state. He abandoned this position in July 1913 to support the Underwood Act. Later that year he supported passage of the Federal Reserve Act while 1914 saw him vote for the Federal Trade Commission Act and Clayton Antitrust Act. Patronage requests were a point of concern for Smith and his handling of them angered potential supporters. When Governor Hunt announced he had no intentions of running for Smith's senate seat observers noted that many of Smith's appointments had gone to Hunt supporters. Following Hunt's announcement, the Governor threw his network of support behind Smith. As the 1914 elections approached, Smith's well-known drinking habit cost him votes from supporters of prohibition. This was balanced on September 5, 1914 when President Wilson sent a telegram stating it would be a \\"serious loss to the public\\" if Smith was not reelected for another term in the U.S. Senate. Smith's support proved sufficient and he won a majority of the votes in a five-way general election. =Second term= As the 64th United States Congress began, Smith continued with his normal efforts to obtain funding for bridges, irrigation systems, public buildings, and pensions. With the increasing importance of the automobile, he added \\"good roads\\" to his list of interests. The Arizona Senator advocated control of National Forests be transferred to the states. While in January 1916, he spoke against making the Philippines a colony of the United States Throughout the Congress, Smith voted with his party. Towards this end he continued to support New Freedom legislation such as the Adamson Act, Federal Farm Loan Act, Warehouse Act of 1916 With the outbreak of World War I, Smith supported Wilson's neutrality position but did vote in support of military preparedness legislation. On September 8, 1916, Smith voted to confirm Louis Brandeis as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. By the start of the 65th United States Congress, Smith's advancing age was forcing him to take a less active role in day-to-day politics. He also gained a seat on the Appropriations committee. His committee chairmanship was changed from the Irrigation and Reclamation panel to the Committee on Printing. Smith was absent from the Senate when vote for the United States to enter World War I occurred. He was, however, a supporter of the war effort. Towards this end he voted for the Espionage Act of 1917, Selective Service Act of 1917, and to create Liberty Bonds. His support for wartime legislation was not absolute as Smith objected to sections of the Sedition Act of 1918 which required proof of intent during the commission of sedition. In addition to war-related activities, Smith served as a floor leader for ratification of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. During the third session of the 65th Congress, Smith joined with Senator Ashurst in a call for the United States to purchase Baja California from Mexico. The 1918 Senate elections returned control of the Senate to the Republicans. Smith voted for the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting Women's suffrage but was absent from much of the 66th United States Congress' first session. He was instead occupied in Kentucky visiting sick relatives. When President Woodrow Wilson proposed creating the League of Nations, Smith became an avid supporter of the plan. Despite his advancing age, Smith was determined to win another term in the election of 1920. The senator's support for the League of Nations became a campaign issue. Meanwhile, labor unions were upset with the senator over his voting record on labor issues. He overcame these issues to win the Democratic primary. During the general election, Ralph Cameron attacked Smith on these two issues and added that while Smith had found time to visit Kentucky he had rarely returned to Arizona during the previous six years. Smith countered by pointing out that there had been no Senate recess long enough to allow for a trip from Washington D.C. to Arizona. Smith could not overcome these issues and lost in the general election. Later life Smith in his later years The loss of his reelection bid left Smith embittered. Additionally, his remaining financial resources were limited and Smith found himself in need of a job. To address these concerns Smith's friend, Epes Randolph, told him \\"Mark, you should go back to Washington and say to President Wilson, 'Mr. President, I've made a damn fool of myself over you a good many times‚Äînow you make a damn fool of yourself over me just once‚Äîgive me some kind of a job'\\" Smith followed this advice and was appointed to the International Joint Commission on March 3, 1921, the last full day in office for both the Senator and President. During his final years, Smith lived in Washington's Occidental Hotel, taking occasional trips to Kentucky to visit his remaining family. In Washington, he received only occasional visits from a niece living in Kentucky. The solitude bothered him as shown in a January 1924 note where he wrote: \\"was surenuff lonesome and hungry to hear something of old friends.\\" His health also began to decline as he developed arthritis in his left hip. Smith's outlook of this development was shown by his statement, \\"I can't walk a step without the crutches, and even that aid can't prevent suffering. The doctors call it arthritis‚ÄîI call it hell, for that is what it really amounts to.\\" With less than a dozen friends from his early days in Arizona, Smith longed to be with \\"my dogs and gun, my friends, my fishing rod, the trees and flowers and songs of birds and babbling brooks. Losing these paints the receding landscape in dull drab leaden colors in taking away the great attractions of life before demanding its surrender.\\" Smith died on April 7, 1924 of heart disease. His death was announced to the United States Senate by Henry F. Ashurst. Smith was buried in Cynthiana, Kentucky at the Battle Grove Cemetery. His tombstone epitaph, written by Smith himself, reads \\"Here lies a good man -- a lover of fast horses, pretty women and good whiskey\\".

It was developed by the Irish logician Carew Meredith in the 1950s and inspired by the work of ≈Åukasiewicz. Informal description A rule of detachment (often referred to as modus ponens) says: \\"Given that p implies q, and given p, infer q.\\" The condensed detachment goes a step further and says: \\"Given that p implies q, and given an r, use a unifier of p and r to make p and r the same, then use a standard rule of detachment.\\" A substitution A that when applied to p produces t, and substitution B that when applied to r produces t, are called unifiers of p and r. Various unifiers may produce expressions with varying numbers of free variables. Some possible unifying expressions are substitution instances of others. If one expression is a substitution instance of another (and not just a variable renaming), then that other is called \\"more general\\". If the most general unifier is used in condensed detachment, then the logical result is the most general conclusion that can be made in the given inference with the given second expression. Since any weaker inference you can get is a substitution instance of the most general one, nothing less than the most general unifier is ever used in practice. Some logics, such as classical propositional calculus, have a set of defining axioms with the \\"D-completeness\\" property. If a set of axioms is D-Complete, then any valid theorem of the system, including all of its substitution instances (up to variable renaming), can be generated by condensed detachment alone. For example, if p \\\\rightarrow p is a theorem of a D-complete system, condensed detachment can prove not only that theorem but also its substitution instance ( p \\\\rightarrow p ) \\\\rightarrow ( p \\\\rightarrow p ) by using a longer proof. Note that \\"D-completeness\\" is a property of an axiomatic basis for a system, not an intrinsic property of a logic system itself. J. A. Kalman proved that any conclusion that can be generated by a sequence of uniform substitution (all instances of a variable are replaced with the same content) and modus ponens steps can either be generated by condensed detachment alone, or is a substitution instance of something that can be generated by condensed detachment alone. This makes condensed detachment useful for any logic system that has modus ponens and substitution, regardless of whether or not it is D-complete. D-notation Since a given major premise and a given minor premise uniquely determine the conclusion (up to variable renaming), Meredith observed that it was only necessary to note which two statements were involved and that the condensed detachment can be used without any other notation required. This led to the \\"D-notation\\" for proofs. This notation uses the \\"D\\" operator to mean condensed detachment, and takes 2 arguments, in a standard prefix notation string. For example, if you have four axioms a typical proof in D-notation might look like: DD12D34 which shows a condensed detachment step using the result of two prior condensed detachment steps, the first of which used axioms 1 and 2, and the second of which used axioms 3 and 4. This notation, besides being used in some automated theorem provers, sometimes appears in catalogs of proofs. Condensed detachment's use of unification predates the resolution techniques of automated theorem proving. Advantages For automated theorem proving condensed detachment has a number of advantages over raw modus ponens and uniform substitution. At a Modus Ponens and substitution proof you have an infinite number of choices for what you can substitute for variables. This means that you have an infinite number of possible next steps. With condensed detachment there are only a finite number of possible next steps in a proof. The D-notation for complete condensed detachment proofs allows easy description of proofs for cataloging and search. A typical complete 30 step proof is less than 60 characters long in D-notation (excluding the statement of the axioms.)

History  Father Louis-Pierre Thury sought to gather the Mi'kmaq of Peninsular Nova Scotia into a single settlement around Shubenacadie as early as 1699. Not until the Dummer's War between the New France-aligned Wabanaki Confederacy and English New England from 1722‚Äì1725, however, did Antoine Gaulin,Dictionary of Canadian Biography a Quebec-born missionary, erect a permanent mission at Shubenacadie (adjacent to Snides Lake and close to the former Residential school). He also made seasonal trips to Cape Sable, LaHave, and Mirlegueche.Northeast Archaeological Research Plaque at Father Le Loutre's Mission, Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia The Shubenacadie mission's dedication to Saint Anne speaks to a spirit of accommodation on the part of both the French and the Mi'kmaq. Anne, traditionally identified as the mother of Mary, was the grandmother of Jesus himself. The esteemed position of grandmothers in Mi'kmaw society was a point of agreement between Roman Catholicism and the Mi'kmaw worldview, and highlights the complexity and contingency of the 'conversion' process. In 1738, Abb√© Jean-Louis Le Loutre arrived in October of that year at Mission Sainte-Anne, having spent the previous winter in Cape Breton learning the Mi'kmaw language with Abb√© Pierre Maillard. During Dummer's War and King George's War, Mission Sainte-Anne was a sort of military base along with being a place of worship. Louis Coulon de Villiers' hardy troop passed this way on their brutal mid-winter march toward the Battle of Grand Pr√© in 1747, and Mi'kmaw warriors used the site as a staging point for their attacks on Halifax and Dartmouth during Father Le Loutre's War. During Father Le Loutre's War, Captain Matthew Floyer arrived at the Mission on August 18, 1754 and recorded: Floyer's map, which accompanied his written report, suggests the presence of three structures at the mission site. Twelve months later, the Expulsion of the Acadians began during the French and Indian War and by October 1755, Mission Sainte-Anne appears to have been destroyed. Oral tradition says the Mi'kmaq destroyed the mission to prevent it from falling into the New Englanders possession and dumped it into Snides Lake, which was adjacent to the mission Historically-minded individuals like Henry Youle Hind and Elizabeth Frame in the late 19th century, and Douglas Ormond, F. H. Patterson, and others in the early 20th, rendered enough of this folklore into ink to save it from oblivion.

The provincial Department of Natural Resources operates a helibase and forest fire fighting equipment depot in nearby Shubenacadie East. DNR also operates the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park at this property. Ducks Unlimited and DNR also operate the Greenwing Legacy Interpretive Centre on the property.Shubenacadie Wildlife Park The wildlife park houses animals native to Nova Scotia, including black bears and moose, as well as several non-native species, including deer, and cougar. There are also several Sable Island Ponies. School programs are offered throughout the year, and interpretive programs are ongoing throughout the summer months. Shubenacadie Sam is a popular attraction around Groundhog Day when the rodent provides \\"projections\\" for the arrival of spring. Shubenacadie Tin Shop Museum The community of Shubenacadie has a small museum called the Tinsmith Museum and Craft Shop.Tinsmith museum website Dating to the early 1890s, the building was used continuously as a milk can fabrication facility and hardware store until 2000. Its late owner Harry Smith left the property to the community. It converted the building to a museum. The museum features: * A hardware store - with goods and supplies from the 1920s. * Tinsmith shop - with all the original equipment intact from the 1890s. * Craft shop and gift store, staffed and stocked by local Nova Scotian artists. * Additional exhibits - veterans memorial, clothing, household goods, farm tools. The Atlantic Motorsport Park is located in North Salem, approximately 11 kilometres northwest of Shubenacadie.Atlantic Motorsport Park It is one of North America's only full-time road racing tracks that is owned and operated completely by volunteers. Shubenacadie Residential School Shubenacadie was the location of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, a Canadian residential school, that was operated from 1923 to 1967 by two Roman Catholic orders, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. This was the only Indian residential school in Atlantic Canada. The school building was destroyed in a fire in 1986 and today the property has been adapted for the Scotia Plastics factory. Nora Bernard, a Mi'kmaw activist, attended the school for five years. Later in life, she was directly responsible for what became the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history, compensation for an estimated 79,000 former students of the Canadian Indian residential school system.Halifax Daily News article on Bernard in 2006 Archived at Arnold Pizzo McKiggan Notable residents * Native American activist Anna Mae Aquash was born in nearby Indian Brook. * Daniel N.

None of them have been seen since. The missing individuals are Ahmad Motevaselian, military attach√© for Iran's embassy in Beirut; Seyed Mohsen Mousavi, charg√© d'affaires at the embassy; Taghi Rastegar Moghadam, an embassy employee; and Kazem Akhavan, IRNA photojournalist. Motevaselian was also an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) member in command of an Iranian expeditionary force in Lebanon.  Early life  They were stopped at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon by Lebanese Phalange forces commanded by Samir Geagea. Speculation about their fate has circulated since their abduction. Iranian officials believe that they were handed over to Israel after they were kidnapped and are still alive and being held in Israeli territory. Israel said that the diplomats were captured by militia under Elie Hobeika. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that the diplomats were believed to be executed by Phalange shortly after their abduction. Geagea as well as Hobeika's bodyguard Robert Hatem also said that they were executed while under the Phalange's custody. The diplomats' disappearance is regularly commemorated in Iran. Both the Iranian and Lebanese governments have tried to gain information about their whereabouts. According to Nazih Mansour, former member of the Lebanese parliament, the case has turned into a political issue, rather than a judicial one since some of the involved people such as Samir Geagea have become political figures. Background During the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Ahmad Motevaselian, a military attach√© for Iran's embassy in Beirut; Seyed Mohsen Mousavi, charg√© d'affaires at the embassy; and Taghi Rastegar Moghadam, an embassy employee, were sent on diplomatic mission to Lebanon along with Kazem Akhavan, an IRNA photojournalist covering the events in Lebanon. Ahmad Motevaselian was the most well-known of the abductees because of his service in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The 27th Mohammad Rasoul-Allah Brigade, under his command, played an important role in Liberation of Khorramshahr, a \\"turning point\\" in the war. According to the US State Department and Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Motevaselian was in command of the IRGC expeditionary force supporting Shia militias like Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley to fight against the Israeli invasion. According to Mohsen Rezai, currently secretary of the Expediency Council, he had been chosen to lead the Iranian expeditionary force in Lebanon because of his success in crushing the 1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran. Lebanese Phalanges Party was a Christian militia operating in Lebanon at the time, allied to Israel. Israeli‚ÄìPhalange relations began 1948 and reached its climax in mid-1970s. At the time of the kidnapping, Israel was besieging west of Beirut. Kidnapping Amid the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the four Iranian diplomats were traveling from Iran's embassy in Damascus to Beirut. On the highway between Jounieh and Beirut, after reaching the al-Barbareh checkpoint in northern Lebanon, Lebanese Phalange forces headed by Samir Geagea stopped and detained the diplomats. According to the Rai al-Youm on-line newspaper, Biar Rizq, known as 'Akram', and Abdeh Raji, known as 'Captain', were involved in the abduction, with the latter commanding the checkpoint. According to Lebanese judiciary sources, the abducted individuals were imprisoned under the supervision of Elie Hobeika, then a Phalangist, in Karantina, Beirut for 20 days and were moved to the Adonis prison in Beirut. Fate of abducted diplomats =Israeli detention speculation= In the aftermath of the incident, Iran accused Israel of kidnapping and holding the diplomats in their jails, and called on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to clarify their whereabouts. In November 1994, Iranian ambassador in Lebanon, Homayoun Alizadeh, said that the four abductees were held alive in Israeli prisons. Similarly, Ghazanfar Roknabadi, former Iranian ambassador in Lebanon, said that there were \\"concrete evidences\\" proving that they were alive, held in Israel. The assertion was repeated years later by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah resistance movement, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's ex-president, and Iran's Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan. The Iranian Parliament speaker's senior advisor in July 2017 argued that the kidnapped Iranan diplomats are in Tel Aviv's prison and have not been killed, according to the Tehran Times. In 1997 the Prisoners' Friends Association, an Israel-based prisoners' aid organization, said that a released prisoner had seen the four disappeared Iranians in Atlit Prison in Israel two years previously, which was denied by a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister. Israel has said it does not know what happened to the diplomats and that it believes that they were kidnapped by a Lebanese militant group and executed shortly after their abduction. According to the Iranian Fars News Agency, Israel has made contradictory comments on the issue by rejecting the allegation of diplomats being surrendered to it, and saying that they are already dead. Elie Hobeika had an interview with the London-based Al-Wasat magazine which was published on 31 August 1997. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) said that the interview substantiated the abduction of the diplomats and their handing over to Israel by Geagea's group. The group was known for its close ties with Israel and for handing over many Lebanese and foreigners to Israel during its invasion of Lebanon. Later in 2016, according to a report by the London-based pan-Arab daily Rai al-Youm, translated to English by Fars News Agency, a recently released Greek prisoner from Israeli jails informed the Iranian embassy in Athens that he had seen the four abducted individuals alive in Israeli jails. The report also said that Ahmad Habibollah Abu Hesham, known as a \\"spiritual father\\" of prisoners of Israeli jails, had made a similar comment that Motavesellian and the others were alive in Atlit detainee camp after visiting and inspecting prisoners in Israeli jails. Abu Hesham died in what Rai al-Youm said was a \\"made up accident by Israel.\\" However, Israel has rejected the allegation of detaining the Iranian diplomats and journalist who were abducted in Lebanon, according to Reuters report. =Death speculation= According to Geagea, the Iranians died some time after their capture. Robert Hatem, code-named \\"Cobra\\", Hobeika's security chief in the early 1980s, said that Hobeika was responsible for the diplomats' \\"kidnapping and murder\\". According to Ronen Bergman in his book The Secret War with Iran, Hatem told Israeli agents in 1993 and 2000 that he himself had probably killed at least one of the Iranians, Ahmad Motevasselian, and that he could clearly remember the Iranians' execution. Hatem is described as sketching the electrical torture tool for the Iranians. \\"Right at the beginning, we found that one of them spoke Arabic. I don't know why but they killed him right away,\\" said Hatem according to Bergman. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that it was believed that they were then buried at a site where construction later obliterated their graves. Ali Qusair, a journalist from the Iranian-based Press TV and Sayyed Raed Mousavi, son of the kidnapped Sayyed Mohsen Mousavi, discussed the diplomats' fate in an interview with Karim Pakradouni, former head of Phalangists. Referring to his conversation with Assaad Chaftari, a senior intelligence official of Lebanese Forces, Pakradouni believed that the abducted diplomats could have been killed before reaching Karantina. Political response In 2016, Adnan Mansour, the Lebanese ex- minister of foreign affairs and emigrants and ex-ambassador to Iran, stated that Iran and Lebanon had not stopped investigating the fate of the diplomats. He stated that the first responsibility lies with the Lebanese side, because the abduction had occurred in Lebanese territory. Nazih Mansour, former member of the Lebanese parliament, had been the official lawyer of one of the families. Speaking to IRNA, he said that the progress of the case in Lebanese courts was very slow. Mansour also said that after so many years, the case had turned into a political issue rather than a judicial one. In 2014 Mohammad Fathali, Iranian Ambassador to Beirut, said that Iran has seen no serious action by the international community and human rights bodies regarding abduction of the Iranian diplomats in Lebanon and their fate. In a statement issued in 2015, Iran expressed appreciation for efforts by the Lebanese government and international figures, including a 2008 letter from Lebanon to UN confirming the abduction, to bring international attention to this case. In July 2018 at the 36th anniversary of the kidnapping incidence, Iran's Foreign Ministry pointed out that there is sufficient proof that the kidnapped Iranian diplomats were moved to Israel according to Mehr News. Hezbollah had included the fate of the diplomats in indirect negotiations for a prisoner exchange with the Israelis after the 2006 war and in the 2008 Israel‚ÄìHezbollah prisoner exchange agreement, Israel agreed to give a report on the fate of the four Iranians. The report stated that the four was captured by a group of Christian militia led by Elie Hobeika, who was later murdered in 2002. According to Press TV, Iran's Foreign Ministry has affronted human rights advocates and the International community for being unable to apply extreme actions against the incidence all these years. According to Fars News, during the 37th Anniversary ceremony held in Lebanon to commemorate the kidnapped Iranian diplomats, senior advisor to the Iran Parliament Speaker divulged that Iran and Lebanon will prolong association in order to solve the case of the abducted Iranian diplomats. According to the Middle East Monitor, the Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan urged Israel answerable for the security and safety of the four abducted Iranian diplomats.

Melody and lyrics The song references the French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, who designed the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty; Francis thought it was a \\"fascinating subject\\" to compose a song about. Francis also mentioned another meaning of the song: \\"Because of Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, but also because it's funny: in Australia, you often say 'It's a smart Alec' for a guy who's nice but not very bright.\\", although in reality, Australians generally use the word to describe someone who is speaking out of turn; often in a way that makes them appear more intelligent than the person or group they are addressing.

The method used is differential reinforcement of successive approximations. It was introduced by B. F. SkinnerPeterson, G.B. (2004) A day of great illumination: B.F. Skinner's discovery of shaping. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 82: 317‚Äì28 with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, humans and other species. In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired target behavior by reinforcing exact segments of behavior. Skinner's explanation of shaping was this: Successive approximations The successive approximations reinforced are increasingly accurate approximations of a response desired by a trainer, the \\"target\\" response. As training progresses the trainer stops reinforcing the less accurate approximations. For example, in training a rat to press a lever, the following successive approximations might be reinforced: # simply turning toward the lever will be reinforced # only moving toward the lever will be reinforced # only moving to within a specified distance from the lever will be reinforced # only touching the lever with any part of the body, such as the nose, will be reinforced # only touching the lever with a specified paw will be reinforced # only depressing the lever partially with the specified paw will be reinforced # only depressing the lever completely with the specified paw will be reinforced The trainer starts by reinforcing all behaviors in the first category, here turning toward the lever. When the animal regularly performs that response (turning), the trainer restricts reinforcement to responses in the second category (moving toward), then the third, and so on, progressing to each more accurate approximation as the animal learns the one currently reinforced. Thus, the response gradually approximates the desired behavior until finally the target response (lever pressing) is established. At first the rat is not likely to press the lever; in the end it presses rapidly. Shaping sometimes fails. An oft-cited example is an attempt by Marian and Keller Breland (students of B.F. Skinner) to shape a pig and a raccoon to deposit a coin in a piggy bank, using food as the reinforcer. Instead of learning to deposit the coin, the pig began to root it into the ground, and the raccoon \\"washed\\" and rubbed the coins together. That is, the animals treated the coin the same way that they treated food items that they were preparing to eat, referred to as ‚Äúfood-getting‚Äù behaviors. In the case of the raccoon, it was able to learn to deposit one coin into the box to gain a food reward, but when the contingencies were changed such that two coins were required to gain the reward, the raccoon could not learn the new, more complex rule. After what could be characterized as expressions of frustration, the raccoon resorts to basic ‚Äúfood-getting‚Äù behaviors common to its species. These results show a limitation in the raccoon‚Äôs cognitive capacity to even conceive of the possibility that two coins could be exchanged for food, irrespective of existing auto-shaping contingencies. Since the Breland's observations were reported many other examples of untrained responses to natural stimuli have been reported; in many contexts, the stimuli are called \\"sign stimuli\\", and the related behaviors are called \\"sign tracking\\". Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010) \\"Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior\\" (2nd Ed) Oxford: New York Practical applications Shaping is used in training operant responses in lab animals, and in applied behavior analysis to change human or animal behaviors considered to be maladaptive or dysfunctional. It also plays an important role in commercial animal training. Shaping assists in \\"discrimination\\", which is the ability to tell the difference between stimuli that are and are not reinforced, and in \\"generalization\\", which is the application of a response learned in one situation to a different but similar situation.Barbara Engler: Personality Theories Shaping can also be used in a rehabilitation center. For example, training on parallel bars can approximate walking with a walker.Miltenberger, R. (2012). Behavior modification, principles and procedures. (5th ed.). Wadsworth Publishing Company. Or shaping can teach patients how to increase the time between bathroom visits. Autoshaping Autoshaping (sometimes called sign tracking) is any of a variety of experimental procedures used to study classical conditioning. In autoshaping, in contrast to shaping, the reward comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. In its simplest form, autoshaping is very similar to Pavlov's salivary conditioning procedure using dogs. In Pavlov's best-known procedure, a short audible tone reliably preceded the presentation of food to dogs. The dogs naturally, unconditionally, salivated (unconditioned response) to the food (unconditioned stimulus) given to them, but through learning, conditionally, came to salivate (conditioned response) to the tone (conditioned stimulus) that predicted food. In auto-shaping, a light is reliably turned on shortly before animals are given food. The animals naturally, unconditionally, display consummatory reactions to the food given them, but through learning, conditionally, came to perform those same consummatory actions directed at the conditioned stimulus that predicts food. Autoshaping provides an interesting conundrum for B.F. Skinner's assertion that one must employ shaping as a method for teaching a pigeon to peck a key. After all, if an animal can shape itself, why use the laborious process of shaping? Autoshaping also contradicts Skinner's principle of reinforcement. During autoshaping, food comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. If reinforcement were occurring, random behaviors should increase in frequency because they should have been rewarded by random food. Nonetheless, key-pecking reliably develops in pigeons,Brown, P. & Jenkins, H.M. (1968). Auto-shaping of the pigeon's key peck. J. Exper. Analys. Behav. 11: 1‚Äì8. even if this behavior had never been rewarded. But, the clearest evidence that auto-shaping is under Pavlovian and not Skinnerian control was found using the omission procedure. In that procedure,see Sheffield, 1965; Williams & Williams, 1969 food is normally scheduled for delivery following each presentation of a stimulus (often a flash of light), except in cases in which the animal actually performs a consummatory response to the stimulus, in which case food is withheld. Here, if the behavior were under instrumental control, the animal would stop attempting to consume the stimulus, as that behaviour is followed by the withholding of food. But, animals persist in attempting to consume the conditioned stimulus for thousands of trialsKilleen, Peter R. (2003). Complex dynamic processes in sign tracking with an omission contingency (negative automaintenance). Journal of Experimental Psychology. 29(1): 49-61 (a phenomenon known as negative automaintenance), unable to cease their behavioural response to the conditioned stimulus even when it prevents them from obtaining a reward.

However, his biggest influences were the 18th-century poet Robert Fergusson and the Italian dialect sonneteer Giuseppe Gioachino Belli.  Life  Garioch was born in Edinburgh, the son of a decorator and a music teacher, and attended the Royal High School before going to the University of Edinburgh. He was conscripted into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1941, and married early the following year. However, whilst serving in Operation Torch in North Africa, Garioch was captured by German troops in November 1942 and spent the following three years as a Prisoner of War. After Garioch returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 he became a teacher, a job he held until taking early retirement in 1964. Following his retirement he worked on a number of Scottish literary magazines, most notably Scottish International. He also spent a number of years in the 1970s as writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh. Works Experience as a POW had a significant impact on Garioch's career, and he provides a vivid account of those years in his autobiographical Two Men and a Blanket (1975). While interned in Italy, he learnt the language sufficiently well to read also authors who wrote in a variety of native dialects. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Garioch wrote very little poetry concerning his war experiences. Instead he focussed primarily on social causes and the plight of the 'wee man', a fact that may account for his enduring popularity (particularly on the readings circuit). These facts, however, have distracted many critics from his extraordinary technical skill and the responsible scholarship of his handling of the Scots language, in which he surpasses all his contemporaries and even his great predecessor Hugh MacDiarmid (of whom he became critical). And there are weightier poems, such as 'The Wire', 'The Muir' or 'The Big Music', which entirely contradict the cosy persona which he sometimes adopted, and which is more often projected onto him. Aside from his original compositions, Garioch also translated a number of works by other poets into Scots. He translated a large number of poems from Roman dialect by Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, who was a massive influence on his own poetry, as well as two plays by George Buchanan (which were originally written in Latin). He also rendered Pindar and Hesiod into Scots. Robert Garioch is commemorated in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars' Court are made by The Writers' Museum; The Saltire Society; The Scottish Poetry Library.

He was a member of the North Carolina state senate in 1779. Early life It is widely believed that John was born in Prince William County, Virginia. By 1770, he had married Mary Lloyd, daughter of Col. Maj. Thomas Lloyd III (b. abt 1710, d. 1792) who had come to Orange Co, North Carolina in 1753 from Prince George County, Virginia. The couple settled in Orange County, North Carolina by 1772, and bought a farm near Chapel Hills, which is still owned by some members of the Hogan family. Career On September 9, 1775, he was commissioned as colonel and commander of the Orange County Regiment, North Carolina militia. He served as chairman of the Orange County Committee of Safety in 1776. He was also Justice of the Peace in 1777, county trusty in 1778, and Senator in the North Carolina General Assembly from Orange County in 1779. In 1792, he was one of several donors of 200 acres of land to insure siting of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1793, he contracted to make the bricks to build what is now called 'Old East,' the oldest state university building in the nation. His name is among those of the land donors on a large marble tablet prominently displayed in Memorial Hall at the University. Move west and death In the fall of 1795, Col. Hogan moved west with his two married sons, Thomas and John, and his only known daughter, Margaret Lloyd (Hogan) Kimble, to Brush Creek, territory south of the Ohio River in Montgomery County, Tennessee. By 1798 he had purchased 1047 acres of land on Brush Creek and the Cumberland River. He is reported to have died in Montgomery County in April 1810. There is a memorial with his name on it at the New Hope Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.Hogan Genealogy: The Descendants of Colonel John Hogan and Mary Lloyd Hogan of Orange County, NC and Montgomery County, Tennessee References Category:1740 births Category:1810 deaths Category:American planters Category:North Carolina militiamen in the American Revolution Category:North Carolina state senators ","title":"John Hogan (North Carolina)"},{"id":"2621916","text":"Edward Hudspith Elliott (19 April 1851, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear ‚Äì 19 March 1885 at Carlton North, Victoria) was a Victorian first-class cricketer and Test match umpire.

The building houses the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). It is one of the tallest buildings in Cambridge. The Green Building was designed by I. M. Pei, who received a bachelor's degree in architecture from MIT in 1940, and Araldo Cossutta. Principal donor Cecil Howard Green received a bachelor's degree and master's degree from MIT and was a co-founder of Texas Instruments. Architecture The Green Building was constructed during 1962‚Äì1964 using reinforced concrete. It has 18 floors, equivalent to 21 stories or tall, with a concrete facade that resembles the limestone and concrete of the older MIT buildings near it. The basement of the building is below sea level and connects to the MIT tunnel system. Three elevators operate in the Green Building. There are staircases at both the east and west sides, whose exterior facades present a vast windowless expanse relieved only by one-story-tall concrete recessed panels. The first occupied space above the ground level entrance is the \\"LL\\" level, consisting of the large Room 54-100 lecture hall. The second floor formerly housed the Lindgren Library, part of MIT's library system, but this separate facility was consolidated into another library in 2009. From its completion in 1964, the Green Building was the tallest building in Cambridge, until it was surpassed in 2019 by Site 4 in nearby Kendall Square. When it was built, Cambridge law limited the number of floors for high-rise buildings. Thus, the Green Building was designed to be on stilts, with the first occupied floor approximately above ground level, in order to \\"circumvent\\" this law and maximize the building's height. The footprint of every floor measures only , which research groups quickly outgrew, forcing some of them to disperse elsewhere on campus. The building's height has some functional purpose. Its roof supports meteorological instruments and radio communications equipment, plus a white spherical radome enclosing long- distance weather radar apparatus. This technical equipment all requires a line-of-sight vantage point for optimum range and accuracy; without the Green Building, it would have required construction of some kind of tower to function. To minimize interference with radio signals, other buildings on MIT's central campus are less than half the height of the Green Building, and the dormitory towers of Eastgate, Westgate, and MacGregor House are at least away. In 2019, MIT began a $60 million plan to renovate the Green Building. The renovation introduces an additional of space for environmental science research, including a LEED-certified addition to the building. Part of the funding for the renovation consisted of a $3 million donation from oil and gas company Shell, which led to criticism from several groups within MIT. Students and staff pointed out the company's involvement with climate change denial and questioned the ethics of accepting Shell's donation, labeling the use of fossil fuel money to fund environmental research as \\"greenwashing\\". Occupancy The Green Building is the main facility of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science (EAPS), also known as Course 12. The departmental headquarters is on the 9th floor of the building. The lower floors of the building contain the Planetary Science section. The middle floors have the Earth Science section (Geology, Geophysics, and Geochemistry). The upper floors house the Atmospheric Science section (which also includes Oceanography and Climatology). Problems The open breezeway channels high winds in stormy weather. When the Green Building was first opened, the isolated prominence of the building and its relative proximity to the Charles River basin led to high wind speeds in the archway at its base. Strong winds sometimes prevented people from entering or leaving the building through the hinged main doors, forcing occupants to use a basement tunnel connecting to other buildings. Large wood panels were temporarily erected in the open concourse to block the wind, and revolving doors were later installed at the ground floor entries to somewhat ameliorate the problem. Several windows cracked and at least one large windowpane popped out on an upper floor, in part due to the effects of wind, eventually requiring all the windows to be replaced. A few years later, similar problems occurred in Boston's John Hancock Tower, a 60-story skyscraper designed by the same architectural firm. After the wind problems became obvious, aerodynamic model tests were conducted in MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel. In 2013, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study re-examined the complex airflow around and through the building. The studies confirmed the anecdotal stories of unusually strong winds at the base of the building, explaining the phenomenon as the result of a large stagnation pressure perturbation at the southern face of the building. A popular but incorrect myth states that Alexander Calder's sculpture La Grande Voile (The Big Sail) was installed in front of the building to deflect the strong winds. The 2013 CFD study demonstrated that the sculpture is located too far away to significantly alter wind flow at the base of the building. Interview with curators Bill Arning and Patricia Fuller. Hacks Because of its height and visibility from the Boston Back Bay neighborhood across the Charles River Basin, plus its rectangular grid of large upright rectangular single-pane windows forming a crude 9 √ó 18 dot-matrix display, the Green Building has been the site of many hacks or pranks. In 1993, one widely viewed hack repurposed the nine top-floor windows as an enormous digital VU meter for the traditional Fourth of July concert of the Boston Pops orchestra. Several other simpler hacks have used the entire window array for stationary displays; this practice is sufficiently commonplace to have acquired the term greenspeak (which should not be confused with the famously obscure pronouncements of former Federal Reserve Bank chairman Alan Greenspan). In September 2011, hackers installed 153 (= 9 √ó 17) custom-made wirelessly controlled color- changing high-power LED lights into every window above the first floor. They displayed a waving American flag throughout the evening of September 11, 2011 in remembrance of the September 11 attacks of 2001. For a short time in the early morning of September 12, the lights displayed a Tetris game, thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal, the \\"Holy Grail\\" of hacks. The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability. On April 20, 2012, MIT hackers successfully turned the Green Building into a huge, playable Tetris game, operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building. Visitors to Campus Preview Weekend (a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students) were invited to play the game on the colossal display grid, which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the US. Instead of a one-shot temporary installation, the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window. To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to \\"opt out\\", each light display is equipped with a manual override button, which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released open-source software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers. On the night after the Boston Marathon bombing, the Green Building lighting displayed an American flag pattern. After the shooting death of MIT Campus Patrolman Sean Collier by the alleged bombers a few days later, a black ribbon pattern was displayed in his memory. As a prototype feasibility demonstration, the Tech Model Railroad Club (located in Building N52) had years earlier added a scale model of the Green Building to its HO scale model railroad layout. Passersby inside Building N52 can view the model building and railway layout through a large window and play a monochromatic version of Tetris via remote control, accompanied by authentic-sounding music, even when the facility is closed. Other hacks utilize the height of the building, such as a 1974 failed attempt to operate a giant yoyo from the roof of the tower. Launching of projectiles from the roof is strongly discouraged, risking deflection by the unpredictable high wind gusts and posing a serious danger to passersby and to residents of nearby East Campus dormitory. Events =Pumpkin Drop= At midnight on the last Saturday of October, First West (the smallest hall in the East Campus dorm) drops a large number of pumpkins (up to the low hundreds) off the roof of the Green Building. The event frequently attracts a large audience, and the area around the base of the building is quarantined off to prevent accidental injury. =Green Building Challenge= A traditional event in MIT's annual Bad Ideas weekend is the Green Building Challenge, a competition in which teams of students attempt to climb up the stairs of the Green Building as many times as possible in an evening. Winning teams tend to complete around 300 cumulative ascents of the 18-story building. Art La Grande Voile (The Big Sail) in front of the Green Building The Green Building faces McDermott Court (also known as The Dot). This grassy area is flanked by the 33-ton metal sculpture La Grande Voile (The Big Sail), one of Alexander Calder's \\"stabile\\" artworks. In May 2011, a temporary artwork was installed in the arched \\"breezeway\\" at the base of the Green Building, to take advantage of its legendary wind gusts. Designed by Meejin Yoon, an Associate Professor of Architecture, Wind Screen was an array of wind-driven micro-turbine generators that would light up whenever there was enough air movement. This installation was featured in the FAST (Festival of Art, Science, and Technology) celebration, part of the MIT 150 commemoration of MIT's 150th anniversary. On May 18, 2013, a night-time projection on the radome on the rooftop of the Green Building by artist David Yann Robert beamed the image of Bengali polymath and biophysicist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose during a lecture- performance on plant signaling and behavior.

Ecologists opposed it because the bridge would destroy a wetland where rare species live. All opposition is now moot because the bridge was under construction as of early 2008 and was finished mid-2011. Demographics In 2001, the population of St-Fran√ßois is estimated at 16,225, an almost stationary level compared to 1996. The population of St-Fran√ßois remains relatively young; 9.4% are seniors and the average age is 35.9 years old. St-Fran√ßois is one of the most homogeneous districts on the linguistic level; whereas 88.5% of the population have French as mother tongue and more than 90% of them use that language at home. 90.5% are Catholic Christian. Cultural diversity of the borough appears by a strong presence of visible minorities which 13,0% of the population represent, just a little less than Chomedey. 86.3% of the households are owners (of a bungalow in 92,9% of the cases) and nearly 40% of the houses were built since 1981. The household size is one of the biggest in Laval with an average of three people. However, the number of single-parent families strongly increased since 1996 to reach 15,9% of total families. St-Fran√ßois is, after Laval-West, the district that are less educated in Laval. Only 12.6% of 20-year-old population and over reached the university and 69.1% have their high school diploma. The ratio of female population strongly increased by 56.2 to 62.1% in St Fran√ßois and the unemployment rate moved back from 9% to 7%, a level higher than the average. The working population concentrates especially in services sectors (76.5%) and the most important professional category is retail sales and the services (24.6%). The labour of St-Fran√ßois is among those that count fewer managers (6.8%). It is also noted that only 33.5% of workers are employment on the territory of Laval. The average income of families in St-Fran√ßois is estimated at $59.139/year, approximately $6.000 lower than the municipal average. On the other hand, with 14.1% people living under the low-income threshold, a significant fall compared to 1996, the borough is somewhat under the average. Source: :PDF document of 2001 census.

As a player, he was a defender from 1985 to 2006, notably in the Premier League for Manchester City and in the Football League for Middlesbrough, Charlton Athletic, Bolton Wanderers and Bradford City. He played the final nine years of his career playing in Scotland with St Johnstone, Brechin City, Clyde, Livingston, Falkirk and Dundee. He was capped 26 times by Republic of Ireland, scoring one goal. During his coaching career, Kernaghan has managed Scottish clubs Clyde and Dundee, and Glentoran in the Northern Irish league, which he resigned from after an embarrassing 3‚Äì2 defeat to struggling Championship side Annagh United. He has also worked for other clubs in a variety of coaching roles. Club career Born in Otley, West Yorkshire, England, he moved with his family to Bangor, County Down at the age of four. Kernaghan represented Northern Ireland at schoolboy level and the Republic of Ireland at senior level. Kernaghan began his playing career as an apprentice at Middlesbrough, and went on to make 212 appearances during an eight-year period, scoring 16 goals. In September 1993, Kernaghan was signed for Manchester City by then-boss Brian Horton. He went on loan to various clubs--Bolton Wanderers in 1994, Bradford City in 1996, and then to St Johnstone in 1997. The Saints signed him on a permanent deal just before the end of the year, after he was given a free transfer from Manchester City. He enjoyed four years at McDiarmid Park, making 60 league appearances and scoring five goals. Kernaghan then joined Brechin City, but he made only three competitive appearances for the club. He then moved to Clyde, where he started as a player but was promoted to a player/manager role in the 2003‚Äì04 season. He guided Clyde to a second-placed finish in the First Division, behind Inverness Caley Thistle, a division which they led for the majority of the season. Kernaghan made 63 appearances for Clyde as a player, scoring three goals. His next move was to Livingston as assistant manager to Allan Preston. Kernaghan was on a player/assistant manager role at the club, making four first team appearances for Livingston, but he was sacked along with Preston after a poor run of results. Kernaghan next moved to Falkirk, where he took up a player/coach role. He made nine appearances for the Bairns but left the club on 2 September 2005. International career Brought up in Bangor, Northern Ireland, he played for Northern Ireland Schoolboys six times. However, as the Irish Football Association policy at the time did not select players who were not or whose parents were not born in Northern Ireland, he wasn't selected for the senior team.Kernaghan youth role breaks Rangers taboo by Paul Rowan, The Sunday Times, 31 December 2006I longed to play for Northern Ireland, says former Republic star Kernaghan Belfast Telegraph, Wednesday, 18 November 2009. Due to his grandmother being an Irish citizen he was entitled to Irish citizenship, and he was selected by Jack Charlton to play for the Republic of Ireland. Kernaghan earned 22 caps, scored one goal and was selected for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Managerial and coaching career He left Falkirk to take up the role as manager of Dundee. He was removed from the position, after an unsuccessful spell, in April 2006. Kernaghan became the first former Republic of Ireland player to hold a coaching role at Rangers. He left this position in February 2012 to join Brentford. Kernaghan made an appearance as a player during a 2013/14 pre-season friendly versus FC Einheit Rudolstadt, replacing Aaron Pierre after 65 minutes. He left Brentford in December 2013, after new manager Mark Warburton decided to make changes to the club's coaching staff. Kernaghan was appointed manager of Glentoran in November 2015.http://www.glentoran.com/news/alan-kernaghan-appointed-new-manager Losing to Annagh United in the League Cup on 30 August 2016 was the final game in charge for Kernaghan, he then tendered his resignation after the game.

N. Cole, was an umpire who officiated in one Test match in Australia in 1884. Cole was born in Australia. He was a left-arm round-arm bowler who was the first exponent of round-arm bowling in Adelaide. He was the first bowler in Adelaide cricket to take ten wickets in an innings. He played senior club cricket in Adelaide and represented South Australia in several matches in the 1870s. He took nine wickets in the match against W. G. Grace's English team in 1873-74. The opening round of matches in the Adelaide competition in the 1881-82 season was held in his benefit. His sole Test match as umpire was the First Ashes Test played between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval in December 1884, when the Australian captain Billy Murdoch refused to accept the experienced English player and administrator James Lillywhite as umpire. This was also the only Test match umpired by fellow Australian umpire Isaac Fisher. A timeless Test, the match lasted four days, starting on 12 December and ending on 16 December, with 14 December as a rest day. Despite the batting prowess of Australia's Percy McDonnell (124 and 83 out of Australia's totals of 243 and 191), England won by 8 wickets, with Bobby Peel taking 8 wickets in the match (3/68 and 5/51) and Billy Bates 5/51 in Australia's first innings. The Australian side had been weakened by the absence of Fred Spofforth and Billy Midwinter; George Giffen played despite suffering from rheumatism, and Alec Bannerman damaged his finger attempting to stop a ball in the field and was absent hurt in the Australian second innings. Cole was still umpiring in Adelaide senior cricket in the 1890s. He worked as a bootmaker in Adelaide. He died at his home in Adelaide aged 79.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry won re-election to a third term over Republican Bill Weld, the Governor of Massachusetts. Major candidates =Democratic= * John Kerry, incumbent U.S. Senator =Republican= * Bill Weld, incumbent Governor of Massachusetts Campaign On November 29, 1995, incumbent Governor Bill Weld announced his candidacy for the Senate seat occupied by U.S. Senator John Kerry with a formal announcement on March 27, 1996. Kerry's previous two general election opponents in 1984 and 1990 had no prior experience in elected office. At the federal level, Democrats controlled both of the state's U.S. Senate seats and eight of its ten U.S. House seats. No Republican had won a Senate election since Ed Brooke in 1972. In 1994, incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election against businessman Mitt Romney with 58% of the vote‚Äîa comfortable margin, but his lowest percentage of the vote since his first Senate election campaign in 1962. However, Weld, a fiscal conservative and social liberal, was a very popular governor; he had won reelection in 1994 with over 70% of the vote in spite of the state's Democratic lean. Therefore, the general election was expected to be highly competitive. This was one of many competitive U.S. Senate elections in 1996. The first debate between Weld and Kerry was held in Faneuil Hall on April 8, with a second debate held on June 3. A third debate was held at the Emerson Majestic Theater on July 2. The Weld and Kerry campaigns agreed to eight debates and a spending cap of $6.9 million negotiated at Senator Kerry's Beacon Hill home on August 7; Senator Kerry later mortgaged his house to raise funds in October. On the same day the spending cap was agreed upon, Governor Weld jumped into the Charles River. He later spoke at the 1996 Republican National Convention on August 14 before debating Senator Kerry again on August 19. Senator Kerry spoke at the 1996 Democratic National Convention and debated Governor Weld again on September 16.

This song was one of several to be considered for the band's \\"best of\\" album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. Musical components The music was written in 1974 by David Gilmour and Roger Waters, with lyrics by Waters, and originally titled \\"You've Got to Be Crazy\\". Waters modified the lyrics in some parts, transposed the key to suit both Gilmour's and his vocals, and re-titled it \\"Dogs\\". The version on Animals is 17 minutes long. The main theme features what were, for Pink Floyd, rather unusual chords. In the final version's key of D minor, the chords are D minor ninth, E‚ô≠maj7sus2/B‚ô≠, Asus2sus4, and A‚ô≠sus2(‚ôØ11). All these chords contain the tonic of the song, D‚Äîeven as a tritone, as is the case in the fourth chord.Pink Floyd: Animals (1977 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Guitar World magazine, Volume 22, Number 11, November 2002.Phil Rose: Which One's Pink? An Analysis of the Concept Albums of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd. Collector's Guide Publishing Inc. [US ] The song fades in with an acoustic guitar in D tuning strumming the chords with a lively, syncopated rhythm, with a droning Farfisa organ playing chord tones (A, B‚ô≠, A, and A‚ô≠, respectively). After the first sixteen-bar progression, Gilmour begins the vocal. For the third repetition, bass guitar, Hammond organ, drums and lead guitar (playing a subtle drone of D) enter. After this repetition comes the first of several guitar solos, played by Gilmour on a Fender Telecaster rather than his usual Fender Stratocaster. Next is another verse of lyrics, followed by a keyboard solo. Finally, after six repetitions of the main theme, the tempo is cut in half, dramatically slower, a new chord progression is introduced, resolving gradually to the relative major, F major, with two lead guitars loudly playing a slow harmonized melody, and a quieter third guitar adding decorative string bends, with heavy use of reverb and echo. The song is then stripped back down to acoustic guitar, droning on the Dm9 chord, with the bass softly striking E, the ninth of the chord, in the same range as the guitar's lowest note, D. Another slash chord movement follows, B‚ô≠ to C/B‚ô≠, followed by the key's dominant, A major, with the minor sixth heard first at the top of the chord, in an A(add‚ô≠6), and later, as its bass note (in a progression of A, A/F, A/E, to D minor). After another guitar solo over the new progression, Gilmour sings a melismatic vocal with overdubbed harmonies from Richard Wright, ending with the lyric \\"So have a good drown/As you go down all alone/Dragged down by the stone\\", as the dissonant A/F leads back to Dm9. The middle section, in a slow, metronomic 6/4 time, is built upon several layers of synthesizers, sustaining the four chords of the main theme, with the sound of dogs barking processed through a vocoder and played as an instrument. (One dog moan is excerpted from the group's earlier recording \\"Seamus\\".) Gilmour's last word, \\"stone\\", echoes slowly for many measures, gradually becoming distorted and losing its human character, before fading out (It reappears later in the instrumental section of \\"Sheep\\"). There are no guitars in this section. Gradually, a synthesizer solo emerges, and as it reaches its climax, the acoustic guitar returns, at the original tempo, once again lively and syncopated. The formula of the first section is followed, but this time with Waters singing the lead. A third guitar solo ends in three-part harmony, playing descending augmented triads, leading to Gilmour's slow, harmonized guitar melody in F major, in a section of music indistinguishable from its first appearance in the song. This leads to the final verse, with Waters singing a new, repeating melody for the sixteen lines beginning \\"Who was...\\". Originally sung over the tonic only, in the final recording the multiple harmonized guitars alternate between D minor and C major, while the bass further extends the harmony with a descending F, E, D, and C, creating the sense of an F sixth chord followed by C/E. Originally, Waters' lyrics (\\"Who was born in a house full of pain\\", etc.) were echoed by Gilmour and Richard Wright in a round style, but in the final recording only the last few are repeated, and done so by Waters himself, using tape delay. This section resolves first to B‚ô≠, then to A, before concluding with the A, F, E bass movement to a sustained Dm9, as the lyrics again end with \\"dragged down by the stone\\". \\"Dogs\\" is the only song on Animals in which Gilmour sings a lead part or receives a co-writing credit. It was also Wright's last vocal contribution before leaving the band in 1979. Concept Fitting into the album's Orwellian concept of comparing human behavior to various animals, \\"Dogs\\" concentrates on the aggressive, ruthlessly competitive world of business, describing a high-powered businessman. The first two verses detail his predatory nature ‚Äî outwardly charming and respectable with his \\"club tie and a firm handshake, a certain look in the eye and an easy smile\\", while behind this facade he lies waiting \\"to pick out the easy meat...to strike when the moment is right\\", and to stab those who trust him in the back. Subsequent verses portray the emptiness of his existence catching up to him as he grows older, retiring to the south rich but unloved: \\"just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer\\", and drowning under the weight of a metaphorical stone. The final verse explores a number of aspects of business life and how it compares to dogs, for example taking chances and being \\"trained not to spit in the fan\\", losing their individuality (\\"broken by trained personnel\\"), obeying their superiors (\\"fitted with collar and chain\\"), being rewarded for good behaviour (\\"given a pat on the back\\"), working harder than the other workers (\\"breaking away from the pack\\") and getting to know everyone but spending less time with family (\\"only a stranger at home\\"). Recommended by a friend of Roger Waters named Joel Eaves, this line was personal to him as he was split from his family at infancy, being \\"broken away\\", as he put it. He later joined the Air Force squadron known as \\"Wolfpack\\", which directly inspired the implementation of this line. Every line of this verse begins with the words \\"Who was\\", which prompted comparison to Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Howl\\".[ Review of the song \\"Dogs\\"], AllMusic However, Waters has denied the Ginsberg poem was any influence on his lyrics. Instead, these lines can be seen as subordinate clauses to the lyric line that precedes them (\\"And you believe at heart everyone's a killer/Who was born in a house full of pain/Who was [etc.]\\").Interview with Roger Waters in Which One's Pink? An Analysis of the Concept Albums of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd by Phil Rose. Collector's Guide Publishing Inc. [US ]Recordings There is an obvious link to the band's 1971 song on Meddle, Seamus, which was an early use of a doghowling by Pink Floyd. Early versions During 1974 performances of \\"You've Got to Be Crazy\\", which can be heard on the Immersion Box Set and the Experience version of Wish You Were Here, the band performed the song faster than it would eventually become, and in its original key of E minor, before they started using D tuning on their guitars, for a concert pitch of D minor. The lyrics, though different, were thematically similar to the final version of \\"Dogs\\". The lyrics were modified by the time the song was played live in 1975, and then the lyrics changed again when recording Animals. Equally impossible was for Gilmour or Waters to sing the song's highest part, \\"dragged down by the stone\\", in the original key, which would begin on the first B above middle C. As any recording of the early performances will attest, neither singer could quite reach and sustain it, even when attempting it together. The line appears twice, as the climax to each singer's performance. It was likely for the sake of achieving high-quality lead vocals, specifically on this line, that they lowered the key before committing the song to record (Waters, however, would go on to reach even higher notes on songs like \\"Hey You\\", \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" and \\"One of My Turns\\").Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Roger Waters: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984 Chappell Music Ltd., London, England, ) The bootleg release From Abbey Road to Britannia Row: The Extraction Tapes (2014) includes a work-in-progress studio version of \\"Dogs.\\" This version is closer musically to the official album version than the earlier \\"You've Got to Be Crazy\\" live versions, but it has distinct differences. Unlike the album version, it is sung almost entirely by Waters; Gilmour sings only the middle section (\\"And when you lose control...\\"). The synthesizer solo (with barking dog effects) is missing (accounting for the track's duration of just under 14 minutes, as opposed to the 17-minute version on Animals), and some of the lyrics are different, most notably in the closing \\"Who was...\\" verse. Live versions The song was performed nightly during the 1977 tour. When played on the 1977 tour, David Gilmour would sing all but the last section and played his acoustic parts on electric guitar making it easy to switch between lead and rhythm with his Telecaster played in D standard tuning. The song had some different solos performed live to its studio counterpart. Also, before the final guitar solo, David would perform an extra solo. Roger would sing the \\"who was born in a house full of pain\\" section. Then for the last part, Waters would sing \\"breaking away from the pack\\" with Gilmour and Wright singing a round (similarly to performances on the 1974/75 Gotta Be Crazy tour) and both Gilmour and Waters singing the final \\"who was dragged down by the stone\\". Roger Waters regularly performed this song on his In the Flesh Tour with Jon Carin and Doyle Bramhall II replacing Gilmour on vocals and guitars, respectively. Waters also performed the song to open the second set of his Us + Them Tour shows, with Dave Kilminster and Jonathan Wilson on guitars, and the latter on vocals. However, despite Wilson replacing Gilmour's role on vocals during this tour, the sample of Gilmour's voice echoing the word \\"stone\\" from the original studio recording was utilized on a backing track during the middle section. Cover versions Les Claypool's Frog Brigade performed and released a live version of \\"Dogs\\" on the album Live Frogs Set 2 (2001). The entire album is a complete performance of Pink Floyd's Animals album, recorded in October 2000.

Unlike Friedrich Schmiedl, whom the Austrian Authorities banned from further experimenting, Smith was encouraged in his experiments by Indian Officials. In the ten-year span of his experiments (1934-1944), Smith made some 270 launches, including at least 80 rocket mail flights. Early life He was born on 14 February at Strawberry Hill, in Shillong, Assam. As a boy, along with other schoolmates Smith attempted to transport live garden lizards in rockets over the swimming pool of St. Patrick's School, Asansol. He attended St. Patrick's from 1903 to 1911. Smith was the first rocket experimenter to successfully transport foodstuff, medicine and livestock via rockets. Smith worked as a customs official, a policeman and a dentist. He became the Secretary of the Indian Airmail Society, and combined his work with his interest in rocketry. His first launch was on 30 September 1934, experimenting with 270 more by 4 December 1944. 80 of these contained mail, and his achievements include the first successful rocket mail sent over a river and the first rocket to carry a parcel. Mail rockets On 30 September 1934, he launched his first mail rocket, using a rocket made locally by the Orient Firework Company of Calcutta. The flight was a ship-to-shore launch, The rocket carrying 143 covers, left the D.V. Pansy and exploded mid-air scattering the mail over the sea. 140 covers were recovered and taken to the Sagar Lighthouse, where the keeper postmarked the mail. This was followed by: shore-to-ship, night, and miniature newspaper flights. Smith's flights in Sikkim, a British Protectorate in the eastern Himalayas, received official sanction from ruler of Sikkim, Tashi Namgyal. Here he carried out 20 successful rocket experiments and achieved the first rocket parcel mail. The Oriental Fireworks Company supplied Smith with 16 rockets between 23 March 1935 and 29 June 1935. Between them, these \\"Silver Jubilee\\" flights carried over a thousand covers. 261x261px Smith made history once again, when he used his rockets to carry a food package across a river to the Quetta region, which had suffered an earthquake. The package contained: rice, grain, spices, biris (Indian cigarettes) and 150 rocketgrams. Achievements Stephen Smith also effected the world's first livestock transport when on 29 June 1935, a rocket carried a cock and hen together with 189 rocketgrams across the river Damodar. Both animals survived the flight and were donated to a private zoo in Calcutta. A later effort, successfully carried; a snake (Miss Creepy), an apple and 106 covers. Smith demonstrated his experiments during the war years, few items of mail were carried on these flights, The last series of rockets were gas propelled and the last flight took place on 4 December 1944. Smith died on 15 February 1951. He is known as the \\"Father of Aerophilately\\" in India. The Department of Posts in India issued a commemorative stamp on 19 December 1992 honouring this Anglo-Indian pioneer of airborne mail.

PPA, High Performance Polyamide) is a subset of thermoplastic synthetic resins in the polyamide (nylon) family defined as when 55% or more moles of the carboxylic acid portion of the repeating unit in the polymer chain is composed of a combination of terephthalic (TPA) and isophthalic (IPA) acids.ASTM standard D 5336 -15a The substitution of aliphatic diacids by aromatic diacids in the polymer backbone increases the melting point, glass transition temperature, chemical resistance and stiffness.Cousin, Thibault, Jocelyne Galy, and Jerome Dupuy. \\"Molecular Modelling of Polyphthalamides Thermal Properties: Comparison between Modelling and Experimental Results.\\" Elsevier 53.15 (2012): 3203-210. Web. 26 Nov. 2013.Harper, Charles A (2002-06-10). Handbook of plastics, elastomers, and composites. pp. 51‚Äì52. . PPA based resins are molded into parts to replace metals in applications requiring high temperature resistance such as automotive powertrain components, the housing for high temperature electrical connectors and many other uses. Formulated PPA granules ready for molding Structure The diamines in PPAs are aliphatic. PA6T homopolymer melts at 371 ¬∞C, which renders it intractable. To make usable polymers, it is necessary to lower the melting point, which can be achieved practically using either a longer diamine (with 9-12 carbon atoms) or by copolymerizing 6I. Three copolymers have found commercial success: PA 6T/66, PA 6T/\\"DT\\" and PA6T/6I (with Isophthalic acid). Polyphthalamide with 6T-Segment Polyphthalamide TPA/hexamethylenediamine (6T) repeat unit Polyphthalamide with DT-Segment Polyphthalamide TPA/methylpentanediamine (DT) repeat unit If more than 55% of the acid part of a PPA is made out of IPA, then the copolymer is amorphous.Cousin, Thibault, Jocelyne Galy, and Jerome Dupuy. \\"Molecular Modelling of Polyphthalamides Thermal Properties: Comparison between Modelling and Experimental Results.\\" Elsevier 53.15 (2012): 3203-210. Web. 26 Nov. 2013. Molar masses for PPAs made with direct polycondensation techniques range between 12,000 and 16,000 g/mol. Properties Compared to aliphatic polyamides, PPAs offer improved * chemical resistance * higher strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures * creep and fatigue resistance * warpage * dimensional stability * sensitivity to moisture absorption The glass transition temperature of PPA increases as the amount of TPA increases. If more than 55% of the acid part of a PPA is made out of IPA, then the copolymer is amorphous. The properties of semicrystalline polymers v amorphous polymers are described elsewhere in detail. Briefly, crystallinity helps with chemical resistance and mechanical properties above the glass transition temperature (but below the melting point). Amorphous polymers are good in warpage and transparency. Like aliphatic nylons, PPAs can be (in fact are almost invariably) modified with reinforcing agents such as glass fibers, tougheners and/or stabilizers. Formulations with specific properties have been developed. For example, resins with ability to bond directly to elastomers to give plastic-rubber composites, and with approval for direct contact with drinking water and food.Evonik Industries, http://www.vestamid.com/product/vestamid/en/products- services/pages/default.aspx =Polyphthalamide Blends= The addition of aliphatic polyamides to PPAs (PPA/PA blend) lowers the melting point and glass transition temperature, which potentially makes these polyphthalamide blends easier to process when compared to higher melting/softening PPAs. While there have been large investigations into PA/polyolefin blends, little has been published about the properties of PPA/ polyolefin blends. This may be due to the relatively high processing temperatures needed for PPA based resins compared to the temperature stability of polyolefins. PPA/PA/polyolefin blends exhibit a good balance of ductility, strength, stiffness, impact, and thermal performance, indicating that these types of materials should have commercial utility.Desio, G. P. (1996), Characterization and properties of polyphthalamide/polyamide blends and polyphthalamide/polyamide/polyolefin blends. J Vinyl Addit Technol, 2: 229‚Äì234. doi: 10.1002/vnl.10131 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/vnl.10131/pdf Applications Polyphthalamide based resins are injection moulded into parts that are used in a wide variety of applications. Automotive uses include fuel and coolant lines, pump wear rings, motor bobbin parts, fuel line connectors, water heater manifolds fuel modules, fuel cut-off valves, thermostat housing, air coolers, coolant pumps, and LED headlights. In electronics, the high melting point of PPA allows SMD parts molded from PPA to be assembled using a lead-free soldering process. PPAs are also used for USB-C connectors, LED mounts and cable/wire protection. Other applications for PPA based resins include gas pipes and supply lines for the oil industry (due to their ability to withstand high pressures), Medical applications such as tubing for catheters, in personal care, for toothbrush bristles as well as hairbrushes. PPAs are also used in sports equipment, valve bodies for showers, bushings and bearing pads in aircraft engines Lifecycle impact PPAs, as any thermoplastic, are theoretically fully recyclable by remelting, and as a condensation polymer by depolymerization. Commercial recycling requires the cost of logistics and cleaning and processing to be lower than the cost of virgin polymer, which is not always the case. The PPA waste that produces energy can be recovered at incineration plants. The best recovery options depend on many conditions such as local legislation, plastic part design, access to sorting facilities, and recycling costs.

The station is owned by Red Peach LLC. It used to air a Gospel music format but as of November 7, 2007 the station is listed as \\"licensed and silent\\" in the FCC database. The station was assigned the WUBR call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on March 21, 2006. History 910 AM was originally WLCS, a very successful Top 40 outlet and affiliate with ABC Radio. WLCS signed on November 1, 1946, taking the ABC affiliation from WJBO and was owned by AirWaves Inc. Originally broadcasting on a frequency of 1400 kHz, the station moved to 910 kHz in 1951. It remained an ABC radio affiliate until 1956. By the early 1970s, the station became a Top 40 outlet, and in 1978, affiliated with UPI Radio. In 1984 it changed owners, going from Airwaves, Inc. (along with sister stations WQXY-FM in Baton Rouge and KQXY-FM in Beaumont, Texas) to Oppenheimer Broadcast Group of Austin, Texas. On September 1, 1984, WLCS changed its calls to WXAM and changed its traditional Contemporary Hit Radio format to satellite-delivered big band and oldies. It changed hands again in 1988 to Vetter Communications, which owned local NBC TV affiliate WVLA-TV) with call letters WTGE. In 1989 the station changed hands again to Church Point Ministries, call letters to WNDC, and flipped to gospel, but financial problems have resulted in taking the station off the air in 2004. The station first went silent on October 22, 2004 then resumed broadcasting in October 2005 for a period ending November 16, 2005. The station stayed silent until broadcast operations again resumed on November 12, 2006 then ended again 3 days later. WUBR was again silent until November 6, 2007 but again went silent a day later. FCC rules may force forfeiture of a commercial broadcast license if a station is silent for one full year and these silent periods are just under that limit. In August 2012 Pelican Broadcasting began management of the station. Local sports programs by Jordy Hultberg, Buddy Songy and Tommy Krysan are in the weekday line up. Fox Sports Radio was the national affiliate at first, then in May 2014, it became affiliated with CBS Sports Radio.

Fisher was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the youngest son of Thomas Fisher. Before taking up umpiring he played for Hindmarsh (later renamed West Torrens), his fellow players including Affie Jarvis and Frank King. Fisher began umpiring for the South Australian Cricket Association in 1879. He made his debut as a first-class umpire in a match between South Australia and Victoria at Adelaide in February 1884. His second first-class match as umpire was also the only Test match in which he officiated, the Ashes Test played between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval in December 1884, when the Australian captain Billy Murdoch refused to accept the experienced English player and administrator James Lillywhite as umpire. This was also the only Test match umpired by fellow Australian umpire T. N. Cole. A timeless Test, the match lasted four days, starting on 12 December and ending on 16 December, with 14 December as a rest day. Despite the batting prowess of Australia's Percy McDonnell (124 and 83 out of Australia's totals of 243 and 191), England won by 8 wickets, with Bobby Peel taking 8 wickets in the match (3/68 and 5/51) and Billy Bates 5/51 in Australia's first innings. The Australian side had been weakened by the absence of Fred Spofforth and Billy Midwinter; George Giffen played despite suffering from rheumatism, and Alec Bannerman damaged his finger attempting to stop a ball in the field and was absent hurt in the Australian second innings. Fisher continued to umpire first-class matches occasionally in the 1880s and 1890s ‚Äì all but three in Adelaide ‚Äì including Sheffield Shield matches in 1894/95, 1895/96 and 1896/97. Fisher married Elizabeth Jane Whaite (1855 or 1856 ‚Äì 12 April 1949) of Alberton on 31 January 1877. They both died at their home, 40 Tait Terrace, Croydon, South Australia.

The process of creating such a state out of smaller states is called unification. Unification of states that used to be together and are reuniting is referred to as reunification. Unlike a personal union or real union, the individual states share a central government and the union is recognized internationally as a single political entity. A political union may also be called a legislative union or state union. A union may be effected in many forms, broadly categorized as, * Incorporating union * Incorporating annexation * Federal (or confederal) union * Federative annexation * Mixed unions. Incorporating union In an incorporating union a new state is created, the former states being entirely dissolved into the new state (albeit that some aspects may be preserved; see below \\"Preservation of interests\\"). Incorporating unions have been present throughout much of history, such as the Acts of Union, 1707 between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England creating the Kingdom of Great Britain, in 1910 the colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Orange River Colony, and Transvaal were incorporated into the Union of South Africa, between the years of 1037 to 1479 Spain was in the process of Incorporating the Crown of Castile, Aragon, and Navarre into the Kingdom of Spain, though the process wasn't completed until 1716 (Aragon) and 1833 (Navarre), the Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain into the United Kingdom, in 1990 the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen united with Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) to form the Republic of Yemen, and in 1783 the Articles of Confederation were signed by each of the Thirteen Colonies, uniting them into the United States of America. =Preservation of interests= Nevertheless, a full incorporating union may preserve the laws and institutions of the former states, as happened in the creating of the United Kingdom. This may be simply a matter of practice or to comply with a guarantee given in the terms of the union. These guarantees may be to ensure the success of a proposed union, or in the least to prevent continuing resistance, as occurred in the union of Brittany and France in 1532 (Union of Brittany and France), a guarantee was given as to the continuance of laws and of the Estates of Brittany (a guarantee revoked in 1789 at the French Revolution). The assurance that institutions are preserved in a union of states can also occur as states realise that whilst a power imbalance exists (such as between the economic conditions of Scotland and England prior to the Acts of Union 1707), it is not so great that it precludes the ability of concessions to be made. The Treaty of Union for creating the unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 contained a guarantee of the continuance of the civil laws and the existing courts in Scotland\\". . . that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Right, except for evident Utility of the Subjects within Scotland\\" ‚Äî Article XVIII of the Treaty of Union (a continuing guarantee), which was significant for both parties. The Scottish, despite economic troubles during the Seven ill years preceding the union, still had remaining negotiating power. This marks a delineation of states that are able to ensure a preservation of interests, there has to be some mutually beneficial reasoning behind the formal or informal preservation of interests. In the Union creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, no such guarantee was given for the laws and courts of the Kingdom of Ireland, though they were continued as a matter of practice. The informal recognition of such interests represents the different circumstances of the two Unions, the small base of institutional power in Ireland at the time (those who were the beneficiaries of the Protestant Ascendancy) had faced revolution in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and as a result there was an institutional drive toward unification, limiting the Irish negotiating power. However, informal guarantees were given to preclude the possibility of further Irish unrest in the period following the French Revolution of 1789 and the 1798 rebellion. These types of informal arrangements are more susceptible to changes, for example Tyrol was guaranteed that its Freisch√ºtz companies would not be posted to fight outside Tyrol without their consent, a guarantee later revoked by the Austrian republic. This can be juxtaposed with the continued existence of the Scottish Parliament and a separate body of Scottish Law distinct from English Law. Incorporating annexation In an incorporating annexation a state or states is united to and dissolved in an existing state, whose legal existence continues. Annexation may be voluntary or, more frequently, by conquest. Incorporating annexations have occurred at various points in history such as in 1535 and 1542 under the two Laws in Wales Acts in which the Kingdom of England formally annexed the Principality of Wales, in 1822 the Republic of Spanish Haiti was annexed by the Republic of Haiti, Prussia/Germany used incorporating annexation to unite many of the German Princes during the Second Schleswig War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War, Sardinia annexed many of the Duchies and City-states in Italy during the period of Italian unification, in 1918 during the Podgorica Assembly the Kingdom of Serbia annexed the Kingdom of Montenegro, and in 1949 and 1951 the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet (1950) and East Turkestan (Xinjiang) (1949). Federal or confederal union In a federal or confederal union the states continue in existence but place themselves under a new federal authority. The federal state alone will be the state in international law though the federated states retain an existence in domestic law. =Examples of federal or confederal union= Confederal unions also have a known history such as Australia (1901), Bosnia and Herzegovina (federal union from 1995), Cameroon (1961‚Äì1970), Canada (1867), Federal Republic of Central America (1823‚Äìcirca 1838), German Empire (1871‚Äì1919), India (1950), Malaysia (1963), West Pakistan and East Pakistan (1947-1971). Furthermore, there are some more historic confederal union formations like, Peru‚ÄìBolivian Confederation (1836‚Äì1839), Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union (1569‚Äì1791), Serbia and Montenegro (2003‚Äì2006), Switzerland (confederation from 1291, later evolving into federation), Tanzania (1964), the United Arab Emirates (1971), the United Arab Republic (1958-1971), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922-1991), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801) and the United States of America (in confederal union under the Articles of Confederation from 1781, later becoming a federal union under the United States Constitution in 1788). Federal annexation If a unitary state becomes a federated unit of another existing state, the former continuing its legal existence, then that is a federal annexation. The new federated state thus ceases to be a state in international law but retains its legal existence in domestic law, subsidiary to the federal authority. Federal annexations have occurred in many places, such as British Columbia in 1871, Prince Edward Island in 1873, and Newfoundland in 1949 which were all annexed into Canada, Eritrea was annexed into Ethiopia from 1951 to 1962, Switzerland federally annexed Geneva in 1815, Saarland was federally annexed by West Germany in 1957, Vermont (1791), Texas (1846), and California (1848) all were annexed by the United States of America, and Crimea and the city of Sevastopol was (but recognized by the international community as illegally) annexed into the Russian Federation in 2014. Mixed unions The unification of Italy involved a mixture of unions. The kingdom consolidated around the Kingdom of Sardinia, with which several states voluntarily united to form the Kingdom of Italy. Others polities, such as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Papal States, were conquered and annexed. Formally, the union in each territory was sanctioned by a popular referendum where people were formally asked if they agreed to have as their new ruler Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia and his legitimate heirs. The unification of Germany was ultimately a confederal union, but it began in earnest when the Kingdom of Prussia annexed numerous petty states in 1866. Historical unions * Bulgarian unification in 1885, after the 1396 Ottoman conquest. * Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918 * Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918 * Creation of Yugoslavia (1918) * Ukrainian unification in 1919 * Chinese reunification (1928) or \\"Northeast Flag Replacement\\" proclaimed victory of the Guangzhou/Nanjing government over the Beiyang government after the 1912 division. * German reunification in 1990, divided since the 1949 division decided at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945.  German unification in 1866‚Äì71; what became Germany was heavily fragmented by feudalism and partible inheritance (Salic patrimony) during the Middle Ages but remained united under the overlordship of East Francia/the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. However, the states grew steadily more de facto independent through the early modern era as imperial power waned. Finally, the Empire was dissolved in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, and the German states became fully sovereign, and were only united (between 1815 and 1866) by the non-sovereign German Confederation.  Anschluss (1938 Nazi reunification of \\"Lesser Germany\\" and Austria into \\"Greater Germany\\") * Italian unification 1815‚Äì71, divided since its partition into the Lombard Kingdom (itself divided between Langobardia Major and Langobardia Minor) and the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna in 568, Italy was further divided since Charlemagne's conquest of Langobardia Major and Spoleto in 774 and the subsequent fragmentation due to feudalism. * Polish reunification in 1918‚Äì22, divided since 24 October 1795 save for a brief revival as the Duchy of Warsaw (1807‚Äì15) during the Napoleonic wars. * Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War in 1976, divided since 1954. * Yemenite reunification in 1990, divided since the acquisition of South Yemen by Britain by 1867 and the secession of Lahj in 1728. * Denmark and the northern part of Southern Jutland in 1920. See Schleswig Plebiscites. Supranational and continental unions In addition to regional movements, supranational organizations that promote progressive integration between its members started appearing in the second half of the 20th century. Some of these organization were inspired, to some extent by the European Union for example Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and the Pacific Union. Member states are often reluctant to form more centralized unions, the concept of unionism is often present in public debate. Academic analysis The political position of the United Kingdom is often discussed;A Disunited Kingdom? - England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, 1800-1949, Christine Kinealy, University of Central Lancashire, Cambridge University Press, 1999, : \\"... explaining how the United Kingdom has evolved, the author explores a number of key themes including: the steps to political union, ...\\" and former states like Serbia and Montenegro (2003‚Äì2006), the Soviet Union (1922‚Äì1991) and the United Arab Republic (1958‚Äì1961). Lord Durham was widely regarded as one of the most important thinkers in the history of the British Empire's constitutional evolution. He articulated clearly the difference between a full legislative union and a federation. In his 1839 Report, in discussing the proposed union of Upper and Lower Canada, he says: > Two kinds of union have been proposed ‚Äì federal and legislative. By the > first, the separate legislature of each province would be preserved in its > present form and retain almost all its present attributes of internal > legislation, the federal legislature exercising no power save in those > matters which may have been expressly ceded to it by the constituent > provinces. A legislative union would imply a complete incorporation of the > provinces included in it under one legislature, exercising universal and > sole legislative authority over all of them in exactly the same manner as > the Parliament legislates alone for the whole of the British > Isles.Marianopolis College: However, unification is not merely voluntary. To meet this requirement, we need to have a balance of power between the two or more states, which can create an equal monetary, economic, social and cultural environment. We need also to take in account that those states eligible to unify must agree to a transition from anarchy, where there is no sovereignty above the state level, to hierarchy. States can decide to enter a voluntary union as a solution for existing problems and to face possible threats, such as environmental threats for instance. The task of triggering a political crisis and to get the attention of the citizens toward the unification's necessity is in the hands of the elites. Despite it being quite rare, in some cases it works (see Switzerland and the United States unification), while in most of the cases it turns to be a failure or leads to a forced unification (Italy, URSS) where the unified states are deeply unequal. In a realist perspective, small states can unify in order to face strong states or to conquer weak ones. One of the reasons to seek unification to a stronger state besides a common threat, can be a situation of negligence or ignorance on behalf of the weak state which is, to simplify it, desperate and almost derelict. According to a 1975 study by University of Rochester political scientist William Riker, unions were motivated by security threats.Riker, William H. 1975. \\"Federalism.\\" in Fred I. Greenstein and Nelson W. Polsby (eds.), Handbook of Political Science. Addison-Wesley. According to Ryan Griffiths, all instances of mutually willful unification from 1816 onwards were between states that spoke the same languages.

He was the nephew of the former Diwan of Travancore T. Venkata Rao and the son of another Ranga Rao. Madhava Rao was born in a prominent Deshastha Brahmin family of Kumbakonam in 1828 and had his education in Madras. After serving for two years in the Madras civil service, Madhava Rao was appointed tutor to the princes of Travancore. Impressed with his performance, Madhava Rao was transferred to the Revenue Department in which he rose step by step to become Diwan in 1857. Madhava Rao served as Diwan of Travancore from 1857 to 1872 bringing about developments in education, legislation, public works, medicine, vaccination and public health and agriculture. He was also responsible for clearing Travancore's public debts. Madhava Rao quit as Diwan of Travancore and returned to Madras in 1872. He served as Diwan of Indore from 1873 to 1875 and as Diwan of Baroda from 1875 to 1882. In his later life, Madhava Rao actively participated in politics and was one of the early pioneers of the Indian National Congress. Madhava Rao died in 1891 in Mylapore, Madras at the age of 63. Madhava Rao was respected and regarded for his administrative abilities. British Liberal statesman Henry Fawcett called him \\"the Turgot of India\\". In 1866, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India. Early life and career Madhava Rao was born on 20 November 1828 in a prominent Thanjavur Marathi Deshastha Brahmin family. A National Biography for India, Volume 1 By Jyotis Chandra Das Gupta , Page 64 His great-grandfather Gopal Pant and his grandfather, Gundo Pant, held offices of trust and power under the British as also various Indian princes. His paternal uncle Rai Raya Rai Venkatta Rao was a former Dewan of Travancore and later even his father Ranga Rao became the Premier of Travancore, although only for a short while. Madhava Rao had two older brothers. Madhava Rao spent his early life in Madras city where he studied at the Government High School (later Presidency College, Madras). As a student, Madhava Rao was a diligent and careful and strong in mathematics and science. In 1846, he received his Proficient's Degree with high honours. Soon afterwards, Powell appointed him tutor of Mathematics and Physics at the High School. However, Madhava Rao quit in a short while to take up a job in the office of the Accountant General. In 1848, he was appointed tutor to the princes of Travancore at the recommendation of the English Resident which he accepted. Madhava worked for four years as tutor to the Travancore princes. Impressed with his performance, he was offered a position in the Revenue Department of Travancore. In a short time, Madhava Rao rose to be Diwan Peishkar of the Southern division. During this time, Travancore was facing a severe financial crisis and the treasury was empty. A large amount of subsidy due to the Madras government remained unpaid. Not long after promulgating his infamous Doctrine of Lapse, Lord Dalhousie was looking forward to annexe Travancore too under this pretext. At this juncture, the Raja of Travancore Uthram Thirunal chose Madhava Rao to negotiate a deal with the British government which he did successfully. As a result, Madhava Rao was appointed next Diwan of Travancore in 1857. Dewan of Travancore Madhava Rao with (from left) the heir-apparent Visakham Thirunal and the Maharaja of Travancore, Ayilyam Thirunal At that time the entire administration of the state was in a disorganised state, public treasuries were empty and large arrears of payments in way of salaries and otherwise were pending. The Maharajah had already taken a loan from the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple of Trivandrum and adding the subsidy to be paid to the British Government, the state of affairs was bad enough to deter anyone from taking up the post of Dewan. Soon after Madhava Rao's appointment the Shanar agitations took place in Travancore which added to the problems of the state. In 1860 however, the orthodox Maharajah died and Madhava Rao's own pupil, the late Maharajah's nephew, Ayilyam Thirunal succeeded. Under the new and relatively less orthodox Maharajah, Madhava Rao's administration started its progress. Monopolies, numerous petty taxes and cessations were abolished and land tax was reduced. By 1863 the debts of the Travancore Government were cleared and the Dewan proudly declared that \\"Travancore has no public debt now\\". Salaries of public servants were raised by more than 50 percent and its morale and efficiency was improved. Madhava Rao's progressive financial measures were testified by the fact that when he assumed the office of Dewan he had an indebted and empty treasury whereas when he left the state in 1872 the state had a reserve fund of forty lakhs of rupees, a great amount in those days. Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310 While Madhava Rao is described essentially as a financier, he also brought a great deal of development in education, legislation, public works, medicine, vaccination and public health, agriculture etc. In education, he added a study of philosophy and international law, and showed a taste for art and pictures. Despite his devotion to his own traditions, he advocated female education and social reform. Year after year his work was commended by the Madras Government. He also drew up State papers on special subjects such as Boundary disputes, trade reports and so on and started maintaining records of every department. In recognition of his services, by public subscription, a bronze statue of Madhava Rao was erected in Travancore. Educational Development in South India By K. G. Vijayalekshmy,Mittal Publications, 1993,Page-6 However, due to misunderstandings which arose between the Dewan and the Maharajah, Madhava Rao retired in February 1872. Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310 The Maharajah, however, respected his work and granted him a pension of Rs. 1000, a princely amount in those days. His initial plan was to retire to Madras but instead there was great demand for his services among the Princes of India, because of his having secured for Travancore the appellation of \\"Model State of India\\" by the British Government. Henry Fawcett described, on hearing of his retirement in 1872, Madhava Rao as: Madhava Rao was instrumental in recognising and employing Chattampi Swamikal at the Trivandrum secretariat.Raman Nair, R and Sulochana Devi, L (2010). Chattampi Swami: An Intellectual Biography. Trivandrum,. Chattampi Swami Archive, Centre for South Indian Studies, Trivandrum Indore and Baroda Group portrait of Madhava Rao and ministers of Baroda (circa 1880) Tanjore Madhava Rao (C.1880) In 1872, at the request of Tukojirao Holkar II of Indore, the Government of India persuaded Madhava Rao out of his retirement to take charge as the Diwan of Indore. Madhava Rao served as Diwan from 1873 to 1875, during which he commenced the drafting of the Indian Penal Code and wrote minutes on the opium question and the extension of railways in Indore. Shortly afterwards, the Government of India requested Madhava Rao to take over as Diwan-Regent of Baroda whose ruler Malhar Rao Gaekwad had been deposed for mal-administration. Madhava Rao reformed the revenue administration of Baroda and curbed the power of revenue officials called Sirdars. The land rights of the Sirdars were cancelled and their lands were annexed by the state. During his tenure as Diwan-Regent, Madhava Rao also effectively re-organized the army, schools, courts of law and libraries. He also introduced a lot of town-planning measures. Madhava Rao resigned in September 1882 due to disagreements with the new Maharaja Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. He retired to his home in Mylapore on pension.Nationalism and Social Reform in [sic] Colonial Situation By Aravind Ganachari, pages 163-170Princely India and the British: Political Development and the Operation of Empire By Caroline Keen, page 242The Indian Princes and their States By Barbara N.Ramusack, Cambridge University Press page 185 Indian National Congress Madhava Rao involved himself in politics in the later years of his life. He joined the Indian National Congress in 1887, two years after its formation. He served as the President of the Reception Committee during the 1887 Madras session. In 1888, he was offered a seat in the Imperial Legislative Council by the then Viceroy of India Lord Dufferin but Madhava Rao declined the offer on ground of health. While delivering the inaugural address during the 1887 session, Madhava Rao described the Indian National Congress as However, at the same time, he warned that Madhava Rao resigned from the Standing Committee in 1889 due to differences with other members over the resolution passed on reformed legislative councils. The Indian Nation Builders, Volume 2 By Mittal Publications,Pages 347-352 Later life In his later years, Madhava Rao strove to reform the educational system. Even while serving as Diwan of Baroda, Rao was made a fellow of the Madras University. He campaigned in support of women's education and attacked child marriage. He also criticised the literal interpretation of Hindu shastras. However, Madhava Rao was, till the end, a pacifist and was moderate and unreactionary in his views on social reforms.

In 1887, he presided over the convocation of the Madras University. In December 1887, Madhava Rao presided over the inaugural session of Indian National Social Conference. The growth of public opinion in the Madras Presidency, 1858-1909 By D. Sadasivan,University of Madras, page 37 Madhava Rao took a liking for British sociologist and political theorist Herbert Spencer and spent the last days of his life studying his works. He contributed articles to newspapers on a variety of topics ranging from politics and religion to astronomy. Under the pseudonyms \\"Native Thinker\\" and \\"Native Observer\\", Madhava Rao wrote opinion pieces on the German occupation of Africa and on the dress code to adopted by Hindu women in public. He forwarded his article on the German occupation of Africa to the German chancellor Bismarck who replied with a letter of acknowledgement and appreciation. In 1889, he published a pamphlet titled \\"Hints on the training of native children by a native Thinker\\" which was translated into various Indian languages as Gujarati, Marathi and Malayalam. He also composed a few small poems in Tamil. A history of Indian English literature By M. K. Naik , Sahitya Akademi,1982, page 90 Towards the end of his life, Madhava Rao was affected by health problems. On 22 December 1890, he suffered a stroke at his Mylapore home. Madhava Rao died three months later, on 4 April 1891 at the age of sixty-three. Family T. Madhava Rao married Yamuna Bai. The couple had five children, three son's, T.

The main street is Insadong-gil, which is connected to a multitude of alleys that lead deeper into the district,David Armstrong (June 3, 2007), SEOUL lives life on the edge SFGate with modern galleries and tea shops. At one time, it was the largest market for antiques and artworks in Korea.

History  Insadong originally comprised two towns whose names ended in the syllables \\"In\\" and \\"Sa\\". They were divided by a stream which ran along Insadong's current main street. Insadong began 500 years ago as an area of residence for government officials. During the early period of the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1897), the place belonged to Gwanin-bang and Gyeonpyeong-bang - bang was the name of an administrative unit during the time \\\\- of Hanseong (old name for the capital, Seoul). During the Japanese occupation, wealthy Korean residents were forced to move and sell their belongings, at which point the site became an area of antique trading. After the end of the Korean War, the area became a center of South Korea's artistic life and cafe culture. It was a popular destination among foreign visitors to South Korea during the 1960s, who called the area \\"Mary's Alley\\". It gained in popularity among international tourists during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In 2000 the area was renovated, and, after protest, the rapid modernization of the area was halted for two years beginning that year. In recent years the backstreets of Insadong have continued to be gentrified with cafes, garden restaurants, and traditional pension-style accommodations.

Among the historically significant buildings located in the area are Unhyeongung mansion, Jogyesa, one of the most significant Korean Buddhist temples, and Seungdong Presbyterian Church, one of Korea's oldest Presbyterian churches. The central temple of Cheondoism can also be found in the vicinity, which was completed in 1921. The area is well known for sightseeing, with approximately 100,000 visitors on Sundays reported in 2000. Insadong is also a visiting spot for foreign dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth II and the princess of Spain and the Netherlands.Ch'oe (2005:154-155) It contains 40 percent of the nation's antique shops and art galleries as well as 90 percent of the traditional stationery shops.Ch'oe (2005:127) Particularly noteworthy is Tongmungwan,Ch'oe (2005:126) the oldest bookstore in Seoul, and Kyung-in Art Gallery,Ch'oe (2005:131) the oldest tea house.

Following a few days of test transmissions, the station made its formal debut as \\"the first commercially operated radio station in the South\\" on February 28, 1926.\\"Newest Station Goes on Ether\\", New Orleans Times-Picayune, February 28, 1926, Section 4, Page 5. From 1931‚Äì1976 the WAAB call letters were used by a Boston station, now WVEI in Worcester. WJBO was one of the first stations to regularly broadcast news, working in tandem with The Times-Picayune.\\"Oldest Local Broadcast Station Celebrates Birthday\\", New Orleans Times-Picayune, June 4, 1926, page 14. Jensen broadcast from the Roosevelt Hotel and Orpheum Theater. In 1932, he sold WJBO to the Manship family, who relaunched the station in December 1934 in Baton Rouge at 1420 kilocycles, powered at 100 watts, as a daytimer, required to sign off at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 32 By the early 1940s, the station's frequency had moved to 1150 kHz and its power increased to 500 watts. In 1941, WJBO's power got a big boost to 5,000 watts. Originally, the station broadcast from Highland Road in South Baton Rouge, but in 1941, a new studio was built on Florida Street to accommodate the growing station. WJBO was Baton Rouge's first commercial radio station and was affiliated with the NBC Blue Network from 1937 until 1948.\\"Local radio era ending with WJBO move\\" by George Morris, Baton Rouge Advocate, February 27, 1993, page 1-B. (NBC Blue later became ABC.) In 1948, with the launch of radio station WLCS (precursor to now defunct station WUBR), WJBO affiliated itself with the NBC Red Network. It stayed an NBC affiliate until 1979. From 1976 until it folded, WJBO was also affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS), and in the late 1970s, was also affiliated with APR. In 1941, WJBO signed on an FM counterpart on 44.5 megacycles, originally as W45BR. In 1959, the call letters changed to WJBO-FM. WJBO-FM later moved to 102.5 MHz, and its call letters changed to WFMF in 1974. (The original 98.1 frequency is now occupied by WDGL.) As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WJBO switched to a full service middle of the road music format, including news, sports and talk. In the 1970s and ‚Äò80s, as listeners tuned increasingly to FM for music, WJBO added more talk programming. In the 1980s, music programming was eliminated and WJBO became a full time talk station. In 1989, the Manship family sold WJBO and WFMF to station manager George Jenne.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1990 page B-134 Following the sale, WJBO affiliated itself with an array of talk radio and news networks including: ABC Talkradio, CBS Radio News, NBC Radio News, Associated Press Radio, NBC Talknet, Transtar, United Stations Radio Network, and Westwood One. Under the ownership of Jenne, the WJBO and WFMF studios moved from their location on Florida Street in downtown Baton Rouge (where they broadcast since 1941) to new studios in Mid-City. In 1995, Jenne sold the stations to Gulfstar Communications.\\"Texas firm to buy BR radio stations\\" by Chilombo Mwondela, Baton Rouge Advocate, May 11, 1995, page 1-F. The station came under ownership of Clear Channel Communications when Gulfstar folded. The station was an affiliate of the New Orleans Saints radio network until the 2009 season. For decades, it also served as the flagship station for the LSU Tigers college football and basketball games.

Reaches are often named by those using the river, and a reach may be named for landmarks, natural features, and historical reasons (see, for instance, Gallions' Reach, named after the family that once owned its banks). A reach may be an expanse, or widening, of a stream or river channel. This commonly occurs after the river or stream is dammed. A reach is similar to an arm, though an arm may bend and thus have multiple reaches. The term \\"reach\\" can also refer to a level stretch, as between river rapids or locks in a canal. The word may also be used more generally to refer to any extended portion or stretch of land or water, or even metaphorically. In fluvial hydrology, a reach is a convenient subdivision of study; it may be any length of river of fairly uniform characteristics, or the length between gauging stations, or simply the length of a watercourse between any two defined points.Hydrologic Definitions, Science in Your Watershed, USGS These may be measured in terms of river miles.

In September 2005, he was appointed the Commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. The newspaper Kommersant speculated that Admiral Masorin was a temporary appointment until the new Chief of the Main Naval Staff, appointed at the same time, took command of the Navy. Masorin completed the P.S. Nakhimov Black Sea Higher Naval School in 1970. He served as principal warfare officer on the Kashin class destroyer Smyshleny of the Northern Fleet. In 1977 he completed additional officer training and became executive officer of the Kashin class destroyer Ognevoy. In 1980 he became commanding officer of the Sovremennyy class destroyer Otchayannyy and in 1983 Masorin became chief of staff of the Northern Fleet's destroyer squadron. After completing the N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy Masorin was promoted to commander of the Northern Fleet's destroyer squadron. Following completion of the General Staff Academy, Masorin was promoted to commander of the Caspian Flotilla in 1996 and the Black Sea Fleet in 2002. Masorin was promoted to commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy and to the rank of fleet admiral in 2005. On August 24, 2007, Masorin became the first Russian recipient of the Legion of Merit (Commander) from the United States. His award was conferred by U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Michael Mullen, for meritorious conduct to increase cooperation and interoperability with the U.S. Navy and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from September 2005 to August 2007. Under his leadership the Russian Federation's navy participated in Active Endeavor, a NATO maritime counter-terrorism operation in the Mediterranean Sea. He consistently advocated continued Russian participation in the joint and combined military exercises including BALTOPS, Northern Eagle FRUKUS and Pacific Eagle. One July 10, 2006 Masorin was onboard a Russian Navy operated Tupolev Tu134 which crashed on takeoff from Gvardeyskoye AFB, Simferapol. He, along with the 27 other occupants survived the crash and subsequent fire. His visit to Washington, D.C. during which he received the Legion of Merit was first official visit of a Russian Federation Navy Commander-in-Chief in eleven years. His predecessors as Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief previously making official visits to Washington were Fleet Admirals Vladimir Chernavin and Felix Gromov. Fleet Admiral Masorin retired in late 2007 after reaching his 60th birthday. Masorin remains as advisor on the staff of the Russian Minister of Defense. He is married with two sons.

History With its original fleet of 10 cars, the company lived up to the 'Budget' name by undercutting the daily and per mile rental rates of the established airport based car rental companies. Mirkin was joined in 1959 by Julius Lederer and together, they built the company internationally. In 1960, the headquarters moved to Chicago, Illinois and the rental fleet expanded with franchised and wholly owned rental outlets. The company was eventually acquired by Transamerica Corporation, and then sold in 1986 in a leveraged buyout by Gibbons, Green and van Amerongen Ltd., along with management (led by CEO Clifton E. Haley) and selected investors. The company made its first public stock offering in 1987. Team Rental Group purchased the public company in 1997 and took the name Budget Group. In 2002, it sold the company's assets to Cendant Corporation, which also owned Avis. In September 2006, Cendant Corporation separated into four independent companies. The real estate division became Realogy, Inc., its hospitality services division became Wyndham Worldwide, and the travel distribution services division became Travelport, Inc., an affiliate of The Blackstone Group.

Its two main purposes were to handle liaison with foreign intelligence agencies and to gather information about communists and other individuals who were perceived to be a threat to the nation. The exposure of the IB operations came to be known as the IB affair (IB-aff√§ren). Birger Elm√©r, director for IB 1965‚Äì1975 The meaning of the name IB is not known with certainty. It is often said to be an abbreviation of either Informationsbyr√•n (The Information Office, Information Bureau) or Insamling Birger ([Information-]Gathering Birger, after its director Birger Elm√©r). This is, however, speculation, and neither name was in general use within the organization. The key persons leading to the exposure of the IB were journalists Jan Guillou and Peter Bratt and their original main source H√•kan Isacson. The two reporters revealed their findings in the leftist magazine Folket i Bild/Kulturfront on 3 May 1973. The story was immediately picked up by many leading Swedish dailies. Their revelations were that: *There was a secret intelligence agency in Sweden called IB, without official status. Its director Birger Elm√©r was reporting directly to select key persons at cabinet level, most likely defence minister Sven Andersson and Prime Minister Olof Palme. *The Riksdag was unaware of its activities. *People with far-left views had been monitored and registered. *IB agents had infiltrated Swedish left-wing organisations and sometimes tried to induce them into criminal acts. *There were Swedish spies operating abroad. *IB spies had broken into the Egyptian and Algerian embassies in Stockholm. *The IB co-operated extensively with the Central Intelligence Agency and Shin Bet, in contrast to the official Swedish foreign policy of neutrality. In the following issues of Folket i Bild/Kulturfront the two uncovered further activities of IB and interviewed a man who had infiltrated the Swedish movement supporting the FNL, Vietnamese National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam - at this time the FNL support network was a backbone of the radical opinion - and among other things, visited Palestinian guerilla camps in Jordan. The man worked for IB and had composed reports that, it was surmised, IB later passed on to the Israeli security services which resulted in the camps being bombed. The man, Gunnar Ekberg, claimed in his interview to have broken with IB, but in fact was still working for the organization. This was exposed in the following editions of FiB/Kulturfront, but by that time, Ekberg had gone underground. Swedish authorities claimed they were unable to locate him to stand trial. In 2009, he released an autobiography of his years in IB, attacking Guillou in particular for having misrepresented facts, been involved with Palestinian militant groups (particularly the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine), and worked for the KGB; and alleging widespread terrorist ties to the groups and persons monitored by IB. He also confirmed that he had been transferred from IB to the Mossad, an Israeli intelligence agency, immediately prior to his exposure. Guillou had opened the first article by accusing the director of IB of murder on these grounds. The same issue exposed a Swedish naval captain who had passed reports about the harbor security of Alexandria (implying, again, that IB were exchanging information with the Israelis); also the story of a woman who had, on the orders of IB, spied out potential bombing targets in Egypt. The magazine had information from a previous employee of IB, H√•kan Isacsson, who claimed that IB had broken into the offices of two political organizations: the FNL Groups, a pro-North Vietnamese organization, and the Communist Party of Sweden, a Maoist political party. This concerned a Jordanian citizen and a stateless citizen. A wiretap was installed in the latter case. After this uncovering, the defense minister did admit that IB engaged in espionage outside of Sweden and infiltrated organizations within Sweden, including wiretaps. Evidence was put forth in 1974 that IB had built up a large network of agents in Finland, which included the Finnish foreign minister V√§in√∂ Leskinen. This network's main mission was to gather information regarding the Soviet Union. IB had no contacts with the Finnish Security Intelligence Service, since it was believed to have been infiltrated by Soviet agents.  Government response  In November 1973, Prime Minister Olof Palme denied any link between IB and the Social Democrats. However, according to the memoir of ex-security service chief P.G. Vinge, Birger Elm√©r had regular contact with Palme and made his reports regularly to the Social Democratic Party secretary, Sven Andersson. Defence minister Sven Andersson denied that Sweden had spies abroad. He also denied that IB was involved in burglaries and documenting citizens' political opinions.  Legal consequences and investigations  Jan Guillou, Peter Bratt, H√•kan Isacson and the photographer Ove Holmqvist were arrested 22 October 1973 by the Swedish Security Service on suspicion of espionage. On 4 January 1974 each was sentenced to 1 year in prison. Bratt and Guillou were both convicted of espionage; Isacson was convicted of espionage and accessory to espionage. After an appeal, Guillou's sentence was commuted to 10 months. The Swedish Supreme Court would not consider the case. The Parliamentary Ombudsman investigated the IB organisation but came to the conclusion that they had not broken any laws. Concerning the break-ins to the leftists' organization, the Ombudsman stated that since the personnel of IB had entered the premises using a key or a lock- pick and had not stolen anything it could not be considered a crime. In 2002 an extensive public report, named Rikets s√§kerhet och den personliga integriteten (Security of the Realm and personal integrity), was published on the operations of IB. This report clarified the details of the case, but it did not have any legal impact. To date, no member of IB has ever been indicted, nor has any politician or government official, despite the revelation of widespread extra-constitutional and criminal activity.

WPXD-TV, virtual channel 31 (UHF digital channel 24), is an Ion Television owned-and-operated station serving Detroit, Michigan, United States that is licensed to Ann Arbor. The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WPXD-TV's studios and transmitter are located on West 11 Mile Road in Southfield. On cable, the station is available in standard definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 16 in the city of Detroit, channel 11 in western Wayne County, Ann Arbor, Southfield, Birmingham and Roseville, channel 12 in south Oakland County, channel 18 in north Oakland County, south Macomb County and the Grosse Pointe area, channel 9 in the Downriver area, channel 13 on Charter Spectrum, and channel 19 in outlying areas, and in high definition on Xfinity channel 237. AT&T; U-verse carries WPXD on channel 31 in SD and channel 1031 in HD. History In 1973, Ann Arbor resident Gershom Morningstar acquired a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate a local station on UHF channel 31, but lack of funds meant that Morningstar was unable to construct the station. In January 1980, Morningstar sold the license to Satellite Syndicated Systems (SSS) of Oklahoma. SSS gave the station the call letters WRHT, with studios in Chelsea, Michigan. WRHT signed on the air on January 13, 1981, originally operating as an independent station. The first program broadcast on the station was a college basketball game between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Baylor Bears from the TVS Television Network, a nationally syndicated sports network. This was done largely to test the satellite equipment, which would be utilized further after the switch to In- Home Theater (see below). Most of channel 31's early programming, was either locally produced or outsourced by other production companies; it also carried business news programming from the Financial News Network (which later merged with CNBC in 1989), as well as some programs from the Satellite Program Network. The station's original transmitter facilities were located on Highway M-52 in Lyndon Township, north of Chelsea and from downtown Detroit. The transmitter, which was tall, was located on the Washtenaw‚ÄìIngham county line, and was actually closer to Lansing and Jackson than it was to Detroit. It was located further west than the other Detroit stations in order to remain within of its city of license, Ann Arbor (as required by FCC rules). The channel 31 analog signal could be received as far away as St. Johns, Flint, and Owosso, with its fringe range reaching close to Battle Creek, Coldwater and Toledo. The station's call letters were changed to WIHT on February 1, 1981, in reference to its affiliation with the over-the-air subscription television service _I_ n- _H_ ome _T_ heater (also known as \\"IT\\"). WXON (channel 20, now WMYD) offered a similar service, ONTV, at that time ‚Äì but unlike that service, which was generally broadcast during the evening hours on channel 20, WIHT ran In-Home Theater programming at least 14 hours a day, and had a wider selection of movies. However, while IT was available in Lansing, Jackson and Flint, it was not available in the eastern Detroit suburbs or Windsor, Ontario, due to the transmitter's location and signal power. Non-subscribers that tuned into WIHT during In-Home Theater's airtime instead heard an audio feed of Onondaga- based NOAA Weather Radio station WXK 81. IT and ON-TV both faded away in 1983 as cable television became more prevalent in the Detroit area (allowing access to premium channels such as HBO and Showtime). In 1989, the station was purchased by Blackstar Television; it then changed its call letters to WBSX on July 14 of that year. Locally produced and syndicated programming was phased out in favor of programming from the Home Shopping Network. On February 4, 1998, Paxson Communications (the forerunner of Ion Media, whose founder Lowell \\"Bud\\" Paxson founded the Home Shopping Network) purchased WBSX. Paxson already owned WJUE (channel 43) in Battle Creek. However, WJUE's transmitter was located in western Eaton County, within the Lansing/Jackson market. The FCC told Paxson that it could not keep both WBSX and WJUE, as both stations provided city-grade coverage of Lansing and Jackson. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider granting a waiver for a city-grade overlap. Paxson opted to keep WBSX and sell WJUE to sister company DP Media, who changed the calls to WILV. However, Paxson continued to operate channel 43 under a local marketing agreement, effectively making it a sister station to WBSX. Channel 31 subsequently changed its call letters to the current WPXD-TV, after Paxson changed the callsigns of most of its stations to include \\"PX\\" in them. WILV also changed its calls at this time, to WZPX-TV. Both stations joined Paxson's new family-oriented broadcast network Pax TV (renamed i: Independent Television on July 1, 2005 and to the current Ion Television on January 29, 2007) when it launched on August 31, 1998. The station moved its offices from its original facility in Ann Arbor, to a building in downtown Detroit, before later moving back to Ann Arbor. Despite the analog signal reaching close to those two cities, Comcast systems in Lansing and Jackson received Pax/i/Ion programming from WZPX, which Paxson bought outright in 2000. =Sale to Scripps and possible resale= On September 24, 2020, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company (owner of WXYZ-TV and WMYD) announced that it would purchase Ion Media for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. With this purchase, Scripps will divest 23 Ion-owned stations, but no announcement has been made as to which stations that Scripps will divest as part of the move (WPXD-TV is likely to be one of the divested outlets since Scripps already owns two stations in the Detroit market). The proposed divestitures will allow the merged company to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations. Scripps has agreed to a transaction with an unnamed buyer, who has agreed to maintain Ion affiliations for the stations.E.W. Scripps scales up with $2.65 billion Berkshire-backed deal for ION Media Digital television WPXD-TV also has plans for a Mobile DTV feed of subchannel 31.1. =Analog-to-digital conversion= During October 2008, the Federal Communications Commission accepted WPXD-TV's petition to move its digital signal to channel 19 on February 17, 2009, broadcasting at 1,000 kW from the Southfield transmitter tower used by WKBD-TV (channel 50), vastly increasing its signal coverage in Metro Detroit and Windsor. However, on March 20, 2009, the FCC and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied the application to move the channel 19 allocation from Ann Arbor to Detroit and to move its transmitter to Southfield, in order to protect CKXT-DT-2 in London, Ontario, which also broadcast on channel 19 (the potential co-channel interference issued would later be rendered moot as CKXT permanently shut down on November 1, 2011). Due to the Canadian government rejecting the channel relocation, WPXD remained on UHF channel 31. WPXD-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 31, on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal moved from its pre-transition UHF channel 33 to UHF channel 50 (which was previously occupied by the analog signal of WKBD-TV) for post-transition operations on July 24, 2012. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 31. As a result, WPXD and WMYD were the only commercial television stations in the Detroit market to terminate their analog signals before June 12, the date which Congress chose to reschedule the completion of the digital transition. The original channel 33 digital transmitter operated at a relatively low wattage (110 kW), and originated from the same tower as WPXD's analog signal in Lyndon Township; this resulted in interference with low-power Class A station W33BY, which also broadcast on UHF channel 33. On or about May 11, 2009, a new application to modify a digital allotment was filed by the FCC, to allow WPXD to broadcast its digital signal on channel 50 from the Southfield tower at a radiated power of 345 kW, which was approved by the FCC and the CRTC. On October 21, 2009, the FCC granted a construction permit for WPXD's new digital facilities in Southfield; the station estimated that the stronger signal would reach an additional 1.8 million viewers. On January 31, 2012, the station began testing its new transmitter in Southfield, keeping its UHF 31 transmitter in Chelsea operational as a temporary fill-in transmitter. The channel 50 transmitter abruptly ended transmissions less than two days later, leaving only its channel 31 digital signal and its analog translator W48AV. On May 23, 2012, the station again turned on its transmitter on UHF channel 50, but ceased transmission the following day. On July 24, 2012, WPXD began permanent digital transmitter operations in Southfield, broadcasting on UHF channel 50. The transmitter in Chelsea remained active until noon on August 20, 2012,http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-09-1510A1.pdf though starting on the morning of August 6, 2012, the Chelsea transmitter replaced normal programming with SMPTE color bars and a scrolling message regarding this \\"technical change\\", noting for viewers to re-scan their converter boxes and sets and aim their antennas towards Southfield. The former Lyndon Township site was later repurposed as a transmitter site for former MyNetworkTV affiliate WHTV in Lansing, which ceased operations on August 31, 2017. Former translator WPXD's programming was previously repeated on low-power translator station W48AV (channel 48) in St. Clair Shores. The translator was originally designed to bring channel 31's programming to the immediate Detroit area, in areas where the main channel 31 signal had poor, or even no, reception. However, W48AV would experience some co-channel interference from WMNT-CA in Toledo, Ohio, which also broadcasts on UHF channel 48. On December 29, 2008, Paxson Communications/Ion Media had requested their construction permit to flash-cut to digital on UHF 48 be cancelled (and was approved as submitted) by the FCC. This would later be replaced with an application for displacement to UHF 25 (and to convert to digital operations there). This application was granted on July 11, 2012. On December 15, 2014, Ion reached a deal to donate W48AV to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar network. W48AV currently has an application to flash-cut to digital. Ion chose to part with W48AV, as it was made redundant following the relocation of WPXD's transmitter from Lyndon Township to Southfield. As part of the transaction, Daystar requested a special temporary authority for it to relocate to UHF 23 (the channel of its currently-operating station, WUDT-LD) to operate W48AV-D as a Daystar station; this was granted. W48AV was the last remaining American television station in the greater Detroit area to convert to digital. On November 18, 2015, W48AV's license was cancelled with the station being merged back into WUDT-LD, with only the PSIP of \\"W48AV 48.1\\" remaining as any trace of the station's existence for a brief period, before it reverted to using WUDT-LD's call-letters and PSIP (WUDT 23.1).

The official tag line for oneSIS is that it is a thin, role-based Single Image System for scalable cluster management. oneSIS is a simple and highly extensible method for deploying and managing one or more root images of supported Linux distributions into a master image used as the root of diskless nodes. A single image can serve thousands of nodes.  Using oneSIS  oneSIS requires functional infrastructure, such as DHCP, PXE, and NFSroot; see HOWTO. Sysadmin has to determine which machine will serve as the source for the image that will eventually be deployed to the remaining machines in the cluster. One of the easy-to-use conventions of oneSIS is that all configuration settings for all nodes within a cluster are controlled by a single file on the master node, /etc/sysimage. This file is used to list the machines in the cluster, define which machines belong to what class, and explains which classes boot which images from the NFSroot server and how their configuration settings differ. Changes applied to the master images appear instantly to the nodes using said images. Changing a node to boot into a different image only requires a quick modification to and a reboot of the target client. Since oneSIS was designed with the Linux-systems administrator in mind, users will not find proprietary-GUI frontends here; all the tools to image a box, copying root-images, converting diskless machines diskfull, etc. are accessible exclusively through the command line interface (CLI). The goal is to let Linux systems administrators feel at home with the typical CLI tools they're already used to. OneSIS benefits include: *Overall system complexity and administration overhead is reduced. *Potentially more stable and secure environment because sysadmins concentrate on hardening single images. *Images can be deployed in diskless and diskfull environments. *Uses standard tools and settings found in any Linux distribution and the open Linux kernel source. *Scalability. *Possibilities for load balancing and failover support.

This storm was a classic example of a nor'easter, but the storm would not have been as historically significant without the presence of the arctic high pressure system located to the north of New York. It was followed by another storm, an Alberta Clipper, on January 12, then unusually warm weather and torrential rain which caused rapid melting and river flooding. Along with the March Superstorm of 1993 and Winter Storm Jonas, it is one of only three snowstorms to receive the top rating of 5, or \\"Extreme\\", on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS). Impact =Virginia= A NOAA snowfall map depicting accumulation in Virginia, after the North American blizzard of 1996. Most of the Shenandoah Valley received of snow. Most of Virginia was impacted with the more central and western parts receiving of snow. Roanoke got a record-breaking . The heaviest snow fell in Page County, with around . Snowfall reached in the Shenandoah Valley and exceeded in much of the Virginia mountain and Piedmont areas. Gov. George Allen declared a state of emergency as power lines went down, people were trapped in their houses, and at least eight weather-related deaths occurred. High winds that accompanied the blizzard caused white out conditions and drifts of up to in Patrick County. =Washington, D.C. and Baltimore= Picture taken of the aftermath of a Washington Metro accident at Shady Grove station during the blizzard, which resulted in the death of a Metro operator. Snow began falling on Washington, D.C. and Baltimore during the early afternoon of January 6, and continued at a consistent rate until mid-afternoon the next day. At that time, the metro area received , and after a few hours of sleet and then a complete stop for several hours, it seemed the worst was over. But overnight, as the storm slowly crawled northward, extremely heavy bands of snow came in from the east. These bands created whiteout conditions as winds gusted past , along with thunder and lightning. By the morning of January 8, the bands tapered off, and the metro area was left with a blanket of of snow. Baltimore received and Washington Dulles International Airport received . Many areas north and west in Maryland and West Virginia received well over with a few locations in the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia receiving up to . In DC, it was known as the \\"Blizzard of '96\\" or the \\"Great Furlough Storm,\\" because it occurred just after the 1996 federal government shutdown and since the Federal government was closed due to the storm, lengthened the time federal employees were away from their jobs in the DC area. Because of unseasonably warm weather in mid-January and a warm rain exceeding on Monday, January 15, the snow melted quickly and caused the worst winter flooding in decades for river and stream valleys from Southwest Virginia to New York.Montgomery, David, \\"Flood Waters Leave Widespread Ruin in Their Wake; Mid-Atlantic Region Awash in Mud, Ice,\\" The Washington Post, January 23, 1996. =Philadelphia and Pennsylvania= of snow fell in Philadelphia (as measured at the official city observation location, Philadelphia International Airport), the most of any major city in the storm's path. It remains the city's all-time greatest snowstorm, compared to its previous greatest snowstorm which was a \\"mere\\" . Most of those , , fell in just 24 hours, a new record for the city for the most snow in 24 hours. The mayor declared a state of emergency, and only police and other emergency workers were permitted to drive on city streets leaving the city to pedestrians. For three days, city trucks loaded with plowed snow dumped their contents into the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers eventually causing major problems with the natural flow of the rivers. It is a rare occurrence for trucks to \\"dispose of snow\\" in the Philadelphia area, since the snowfall amounts typically do not warrant it. However the snow was so extensive, that plowing would cause massive snow piles. City officials had no choice but to resort to hauling the snow to nearby rivers. Disposal of snow became a major issue but temperatures quickly returned to normal and began to quickly clear the snow. This resulted in flooding, when on January 19, a jet stream disturbance from the Gulf of Mexico caused a rapid melt, followed by thunderstorms, which both brought of rain, and caused the snow to melt in one day; or equivalent to of rain. Philadelphia saw its worst flooding in twenty years. Damages were estimated to reach US$1 billion. Blizzard of 1996, Temple, Pennsylvania. Snowfall accumulations averaged in Monroe, Carbon and eastern Schuylkill Counties, around in Lehigh and Northampton Counties, in Berks County, in Chester and Delaware Counties, in Montgomery and Bucks Counties. Other individual accumulations included in Ontelaunee Township (Berks), in Reading (Berks) and Palm and Souderton (Montgomery), in Perkasie (Bucks), and in Glenmoore (Chester). =New Jersey= Snow began falling during the predawn hours of the 7th and became heavy at times during the morning. Blizzard conditions developed during the afternoon and evening as strong northeast winds developed around the intensifying low pressure. During the afternoon hours, precipitation in far southern New Jersey changed to sleet and freezing rain as the low brought in warm air at mid-levels, but remained all snow across the rest of the state. During the evening and overnight hours the snow mixed with sleet as far north as central sections of the state as the low center approached the state from the south. A lull developed in the precipitation in the pre-dawn hours of the 8th as the low center was just off the New Jersey coast, but wraparound moisture brought another period of snow to the state as the low pulled away during the later morning and early afternoon hours of the 8th. Accumulations averaged in Sussex County, in Warren County, in Morris County, generally in Bergen, Passaic, Union, Hudson, Essex, Hunterdon, Somerset, Mercer, and Monmouth counties, in Middlesex County, in Burlington County, in Salem, Gloucester, and Camden counties, inland and at the coast in Ocean County, and in Cumberland, Atlantic, and Cape May counties. In addition to the heavy snow, wind gusts reached hurricane force along the coast during the evening of the 7th, with an gust recorded in Ocean Grove. While accumulations were lighter along the shore, the strong northeasterly flow produced moderate coastal flooding at the time of high tide on the evening of the 7th, with tides above normal. The tide reached above mean low water in Atlantic County and above mean low water in Cape May County. Fortunately, winds switched to the northwest before worse flooding could occur at high tide on the morning of the 8th. The state of New Jersey recorded its second-largest snowstorm at Edison, where fell (the greatest single storm record being at Cape May in the Great Blizzard of 1899). Elizabeth, New Jersey also reported of snow. Newark, the state's largest city, received a record- setting , while Trenton, the capital, received . All roads in the state were closed, including the entire length of the New Jersey Turnpike for the first time in that road's history. Over two-thirds of the state was buried under of snow, making this storm the state's most paralyzing snowstorm of the 20th century. Places such as Roselle and Linden received around . New Jersey was, along with other states, put into a state of emergency. \\"Two feet of snow was blasted into Greater Trenton by 50 mph winds that created giant drifts, paralyzing the region and the rest of the Northeast for a week, One writer called it the most ‚Äúsadistic‚Äù storm of our century. The Blizzard of '96 stranded hundreds of people at Trenton's train station; left thousands without electricity and heat for days; closed most schools and government offices for a week; cut off an estimated US$1 billion in Jersey commerce; forced the National Guard into service rescuing state troopers from snowbound police cruisers; and created strife between officials and residents demanding the plowing of their little streets. In the second week of January 1996, it can be said, many locales across the region looked like they did in the old pictures taken of them during the infamous Blizzard of '88: Houses drifted under; snowed-in main streets that looked like ghost towns; no cars or people on the streets.\\" http://www.capitalcentury.com/1996.html =New York City= Yonkers, New York. New York City's Central Park officially recorded for its fourth- largest single snowfall (records going back to 1869), but many locations in the other boroughs and suburbs recorded over of snow. Schools in New York City's boroughs closed because of snow for the first time since the Blizzard of 1978, 18 years earlier. While most suburban districts in the area close for snow several times each winter, in the city itself they rarely do because of relatively easy access to underground subways whose ability to run is not appreciably affected by snowstorms of moderate to large accumulation; however, in this snowstorm, the transit network was significantly disrupted. Buses were unable to run, and subway service was limited. Lines that ran in open cut and surface routes were shut down for two days. =New England= Providence, Rhode Island received of snow, while Boston and Hartford, Connecticut both received . Up to of snow fell in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts and the northern hills of Connecticut. While this was a major snow event for southern New England, the Blizzard of 1996 was not as intense as other recent events, notably the Blizzard of 1978 and the March 1993 Superstorm. Snowfall amounts decreased sharply as one moved further north, with northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine receiving little more than snow flurries from this event. Blizzard status Despite the storm's common name as the \\"Blizzard of 1996\\", some of the few observing sites to record true blizzard conditions were Trenton-Mercer Airport near Trenton, New Jersey and Morristown Municipal Airport located east of Morristown, New Jersey, with Morristown recording wind gusts in excess of . During the afternoon of January 7, the airports recorded the necessary three consecutive hours of frequent wind gusts of at least combined with a prevailing visibility consistently below along with falling and blowing snow, meeting the official NWS standard of a blizzard. This indicates that the sites experienced some of the worst conditions on the entire East Coast. All other New Jersey observing sites, as well as most sites in neighboring states, failed to observe true blizzard conditions, though many stations did observe blizzard conditions for less than the necessary three consecutive hours.

This plane was used by Former East German Air Force and retired after German unification. Wing fences, also known as boundary layer fences and potential fences are fixed aerodynamic devices attached to aircraft wings. Often seen on swept-wing aircraft, wing fences are flat plates fixed to the upper surfaces parallel to the wing chord and in line with the free stream airflow, typically wrapping around the leading edge. By obstructing span-wise airflow along the wing, they prevent the entire wing from stalling at once, as opposed to wingtip devices, which increase aerodynamic efficiency by seeking to recover wing vortex energy. As a swept-wing aircraft slows toward the stall speed of the wing, the angle of the leading edge forces some of the airflow sidewise, toward the wing tip. This process is progressive: airflow near the middle of the wing is affected not only by the leading edge angle, but also the spanwise airflow from the wing root. At the wing tip the airflow can end up being almost all spanwise, as opposed to front-to-back over the wing, meaning that the effective airspeed drops well below the stall. Because the geometry of swept wings typically places the wingtips of an aircraft aft of its center of gravity, lift generated at the wingtips tends to create a nose-down pitching moment. When the wingtips stall, both the lift and the associated nose-down pitching moment rapidly diminish. The loss of the nose-down pitching moment leaves the previously balanced aircraft with a net nose-up pitching moment. This forces the nose of the aircraft up, increasing the angle of attack and leading to stall over a greater portion of the wing. The result is a rapid and powerful pitch-up followed by a complete stall, a difficult situation for a pilot to recover from.Hurt, H. H. Jr., \\"NAVAIR 00-80T-80, Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators\\". Naval Air Systems Command, 1965, p. 86. at faa.gov The \\"Sabre dance\\" (which caused many F-100 Super Sabres to crash) is a notable example of this behavior. Wing fences delay, or eliminate, these effects by preventing the spanwise flow from moving too far along the wing and gaining speed. When meeting the fence, the air is directed back over the wing surface. Similar solutions included a notch in the leading edge, as seen on the Avro Arrow, or the use of slats, as on the earlier versions of the F-86. Slats can act as fences directly, in the form of their actuators, but also reduce the problem by improving the angle of attack response of the wing and moving the stall point to a lower speed. Wolfgang Liebe, who is generally credited with inventing wing fences, filed a patent for it in 1938 while working on the Messerschmitt Bf 109B. After World War II, Soviet military aircraft designers became known for their habit of using wing fences, using them on aircraft as varied as Mikoyan MiG-15, Mikoyan MiG-17, Mikoyan MiG-19, Mikoyan MiG-21, Mikoyan MiG-25, Mikoyan MiG-31, Tupolev Tu-128, Tupolev Tu-95, Tupolev Tu-160 in swept-wing mode, and Tupolev Tu-22Ms. See also * Vortilon, a similar device mounted on the underside of the wing * Boeing 727 * Sud Aviation Caravelle * De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter * BAE Systems Hawk * Baade 152 References External links * at B2streamlines.com * Wing Vortex Devices at aerospaceweb.org Category:Aircraft wing components ","title":"Wing fence"},{"id":"2622244","text":"AIMS or Aims may refer to:  Education  * Acharya Institute of Management and Sciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, India * Adventist International Mission School, Muak Lek, Thailand * African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa * Aims Community College, Colorado United States * American Indian Model Schools, a charter school system based in Oakland, California * Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi, Kerala, India * Arabic Immersion Magnet School, Houston, Texas, United States * Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards, a standardized test administered by the state of Arizona, United States * Asian Institute of Maritime Studies, a campus in Pasay City, Philippines * Australian Institute of Marine Science, a tropical marine research centre located primarily at Cape Ferguson, Queensland * American Institute of Musical Studies, a summer music program in Graz, Austria  Business & NGO  * Afghanistan Information Management Services, an Afghan NGO providing services to the Afghan government and to the development community * Association of International Marathons and Distance Races * Association of Internes and Medical Students * Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, a Canadian conservative think tank and public policy forum  Other uses  * Aims (album), by Vienna Teng * Agricultural Information Management Standards, a web portal managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations * Airplane Information Management System, the \\"brains\\" of Boeing 777 aircraft * Anesthesia Information Management System, an information technology system that is used as an electronic anesthesia record and allows the collection and analysis of anesthesia-related data * Associated Iron Moulders of Scotland, a former trade union * Australian International Motor Show  See also  * AIIMS * AIM (disambiguation) ","title":"AIMS"},{"id":"2622248","text":"Waveform and spectrogram for the Czech expression.

It is located on the northeastern shore of St. Joseph Island in the North Channel of Lake Huron, approximately 60 kilometres from Sault Ste. Marie. The village had a population of 175 (up from 145 in 2011) and a land area of 2.62 km¬≤ per the Canada 2016 Census.  History  The area which is now known as Hilton Beach had its origins in the 1850s when a wharf was first built. By the 1860s, fourteen families had settled in the area, including the Trainors, Rousseaus, Gordons, Bishops and Desjardins. John Marks came to St. Joseph Island in the 1860s to settle at Sailors Encampment. He moved to the area that would become Hilton Beach in 1872. Marks first opened a store and a wood dock followed by a post office six years later under the name of Marksville. A school was established in 1877, and in 1881 St. John's Anglican Church was erected. J. Archibald built a hotel in 1879, originally called The Ottawa House. It was moved to its current site in 1890. Other businesses included Bowker's General Store, Duncan's General Store, R. Chester's shoemaker shop, and the sawmill operated by Dean and Davis. J.C. Cooper was a wagon maker, and T. Steinburg was the blacksmith, who operated out of the white concrete building still standing today on Hilton Road. General store A.G. Duncan, D. McPhail and John Marks were justices. The village was called Marksville until June 1, 1921, when it was changed to Hilton Beach. Two years later the village separated from Hilton Township and became St. Joseph Island's first village. Many of the historical buildings in Hilton Beach are still being used today. The community hall, renovated in 1989, was originally built in 1896 and used as a schoolhouse until the 1960s. The old town hall, built in 1916, was used as a violin workshop for several years and is now for sale. The Hilton Beach General Store is over 100 years old and is still open for business. The Hilton Beach jail is unusual in that it never actually housed an inmate. The small building, barely measuring 20' by 20', in fact housed the Hilton Beach Library for several years in the 1920s. The library is now housed in another historical building on Marks Street. Demographics  Tourism  Hilton Beach has been a popular tourist destination since the early 1900s. Several families from Michigan, Ohio, California, Ontario, Washington, Massachusetts and Florida have been spending their summers in and around Hilton Beach since the 1910s. The MS Norgoma, a package freighter and passenger ferry, called on Hilton Beach on Wednesdays until 1963. Hilton Beach Marina Today, the village attracts visitors primarily from Sault Ste. Marie and southern Ontario, as well as Michigan. The village's location on Lake Huron makes it a very popular boating destination. The Hilton Beach Marina has over 180 slips (approximately one for every resident in the town) and is very popular in the summer. The excellent sailing in the St. Joseph Channel is the main attraction for many seasonal residents and tourists. The marina operates from May through to October. The Hilton Beach Tourist Park, a tent and trailer park, was built in the 1950s. The Park welcomes back dozens of seasonal residents every summer and is a community unto itself during peak season.  Events  Arts at the Dock is one of the largest and longest-running multimedia art shows in the district, which began in 1986. It is held annually on the third Sunday of July. The Hilton Beach Summer Festival is a classic car show with about 50 cars, plus arts and crafts vendors and the Coureurs de Bois encampment held annually on the fourth Saturday of July. Hilton Beach Community Night is an annual event that has been held for over 100 years in various forms. For the past few decades, it has included a cold plate supper, followed by a parade down Hilton Road and Marks Street. After the parade, a crowd numbering in the high hundreds plays various games of chance and enjoys barbecued food along Marks Street until dark. During community night a new hot dog stand was set up that is very popular. Old Town Hall Concerts is a series of three concerts that began in 1995. This series is well known for bringing in some of Canada's best musical talent. Usually held on the first three Wednesdays of August.  Government  The mayor of the village is Robert Hope, and its councillors are John Wells, Julie C. Moore, John Davison and Shirley Bailey Meeks. The village clerk is Peggy Cramp.

Background Robyn Byrd in the film Debbie Does Dallas. Robin Byrd was born and raised in New York City, New York. A child of adoption, she has never been able to identify her birth parents, due to the unwillingness of her adoptive mother to reveal that information and sealed birth and adoption records under New York state law. At the time of filming the porn film Debbie Does Dallas, Byrd was living in New York City and was still known as Robin Cohen. After taking college classes in marketing and advertising at Baruch College and dropping out as a senior, she attended the School of Visual Arts and worked as a nude model for art classes.Morris, Bob. \\"Cable's First Lady Of Explicit\\" , The New York Times, June 23, 1996. Accessed December 3, 2007. \\"At 17, Ms. Byrd got her graduate equivalency diploma and then pursued advertising design at Baruch College but dropped out in her senior year. By then it was the early 1970's and she was modeling at the School of Visual Arts, where she had been taking life-drawing classes.\\" She subsequently starred in porn films during the late 1970s, including a role in the previously mentioned Debbie Does Dallas. = Public access = After guest-hosting on a leased access show called Hot Legs, Byrd changed the name to The Robin Byrd Show in 1977. The show has aired continuously since then, though it now shows reruns rather than live episodes. Each episode features Byrd in her trademark black crochet bikini and white fingernail polish, on an all-red set with a large, heart-shaped neon sign that bears the name of her show. Male and female porn stars and strippers appear as guests and perform fully nude stripteases, sometimes also taking calls from viewers. Byrd and her guests also frequently engage in onscreen sexplay by the end of the episode. Each show customarily ends with all the guests dancing to Robin's recording of a bawdy novelty tune, \\"Baby, Let Me Bang Your Box\\".  Time Warner legal issues  Byrd and Al Goldstein were in a long-standing legal battle with Time Warner Cable (and its predecessor, Manhattan Cable), which wanted to scramble all adult-oriented content so that subscribers had to send in written requests to view it. In 1978, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals struck as unconstitutional the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandatory access regulations under which Byrd and Goldstein had challenged the cable provider's actions, but the U.S. Supreme Court disposed of the case on other grounds. In 1995, the issue was again before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which upheld the regulations and ruled that Time Warner's requirement for written requests was a violation. , The Robin Byrd Show continues to be aired unscrambled and uncut although with disclaimers that the content is not for children to watch. = In popular culture = Byrd on Fire Island with Brian Doherty of the AICPByrd's show and filmography have made her a local celebrity and to some extent, a national one. She is a frequent presenter at New York City adult entertainment, gay pride, and AIDS awareness events. The Robin Byrd Show was parodied on Saturday Night Live in a series of skits airing in 1997 and 1998; Byrd was played by Cheri Oteri. In 1999, Richard Avedon photographed Byrd for a feature in The New Yorker on famous and influential New Yorkers. Byrd has also branched out into other adult-oriented businesses, including phone sex lines and ringtones. In 2015, Robin released \\"Touch Me\\", a dance single with recording artist Lovari.

The Corps is composed of Army officers who are also lawyers and who provide legal services to the Army at all levels of command, and also includes legal administrator warrant officers, paralegal noncommissioned officers and junior enlisted personnel, and civilian employees. The Judge Advocate General of the United States Army (TJAG)‚Äîthe commanding general of the Army JAG Corps‚Äîis a lieutenant general. All military officers are appointed by the U.S. president subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, but the Judge Advocate General is one of the few positions in the Army explicitly provided for by law in Title 10 of the United States Code, and which requires a distinct appointment. Officers who have already been appointed to another branch of the Army are administratively dismissed and simultaneously recommissioned anew as judge advocates, rather than merely transferring branches. The Judge Advocate General General George Washington founded the U.S. Army JAG Corps on 29 July 1775, with the appointment of William Tudor as the Judge Advocate General. The Army Judge Advocate General's Corps is the oldest of the judge advocate communities in the U.S. armed forces ‚Äì as well as the oldest law firm in the United States. The Judge Advocate General, who is referred to as TJAG (pronounced \\"tea-jag\\"), serves a term of four years. Lieutenant General Charles Pede, appointed 26 July 2017, is the fortieth Judge Advocate General. The appointment of then-Major General Scott C. Black, to the grade of lieutenant general on 11 December 2008 brought the billet into parity with the Army's Surgeon General and Chief of Engineers. Mission Judge advocates occupying the position of staff judge advocate (SJA) serve on the special and personal staff of general officers in command and who are general court- martial convening authorities (in other words, who have the authority to convene a general court-martial). Staff judge advocates advise commanders on the full range of legal matters encountered in government legal practice and provide advice on courts-martial as required by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Subordinate judge advocates prosecute courts-martial, and others, assigned to the independent United States Army Trial Defense Service and United States Army Trial Judiciary, serve as defense counsel and judges. The almost 2,000 full-time judge advocates and civilian attorneys who serve The Judge Advocate General's Corps comprise the largest group of attorneys who serve the U.S. Army. Several hundred other attorneys practice under the Chief Counsel of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Command Counsel of the United States Army Materiel Command. Judge advocates, legal administrators and military paralegals are deployed throughout the United States and around the world, including Japan, South Korea, Germany, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Qatar. They provide legal assistance to soldiers, adjudicate claims against the Army, advise commands on targeting decisions and other aspects of operational law, and assist the command in administering military justice by preparing non-judicial punishment actions, administrative separation actions, and trying criminal cases at court-martial. In addition to the active component judge advocates, there are approximately 5,000 attorneys who serve in the US Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. Several hundred Reserve and National Guard attorneys were called to active duty to serve in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Legal Center and School The Judge Advocate General's School began in World War II at the University of Michigan to train new judge advocates as the Judge Advocate General's Department rapidly expanded. It was disestablished for a time after the war but, after a short stay at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, was reestablished at the University of Virginia in 1951. The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS) is located on the North Grounds at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, adjoining, but distinct from, the University of Virginia School of Law. The Commandant of the Judge Advocate General's School is authorized by Congress to award a Master of Laws degree. The school is the only federal institution to have American Bar Association accreditation as one of America's law schools. Judge advocates from all five armed forces of the United States and international students attend the annual Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course in which the master's degree is awarded. The Legal Center and School also trains the Army's new judge advocates, provides continuing legal education for judge advocates and lawyers from throughout the United States government. In addition to lawyers, TJAGLCS also trains newly selected legal administrator warrant officers, paralegal noncommissioned officers and court reporters (new judge advocate enlisted soldiers attend AIT at Fort Lee, Virginia). The school also trains those officers appointed as military judges, irrespective of service. TJAGLCS is not a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), but has paid a fee to receive AALS services. In many military branches, there is a program that will send officers to law school to eventually serve as Judge Advocates upon completion of the program and law school. In the United States Army, the program is called the Funded Legal Education Program. The Army Regulation that explains the program in all its terms is AR 27-1 Chapter 14. Every year, the United States Army will send a combination of up to 25 commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers to law school and will pay all tuition costs along with paying the Soldier their usual pay entitlements throughout the duration of law school to include base pay, special pay, Basic Allowance for Housing, and Overseas Cost of Living Allowances (if applicable). In return, the service member is required to serve as a Judge Advocate General officer for the United States Army for six years. While the Army does not release official figures, the general agreed upon numbers on various discussion boards and forums is that around 80-90 people apply each year and 20-25 are selected. The package to apply to the program includes: a memorandum that explains why you are interested in the program, college transcripts, list of law schools, LSAT score, statement of years of service, statement of secret security clearance, interview with a Senior Judge Advocate, Personnel Records Brief and evaluation Reports, and optional Letters of Recommendation. Army judge advocate, legal administrator and paralegal qualifications Prior to entry into the JAG Corps, all Army judge advocates must have graduated from an ABA-accredited law school and be admitted to practice law by the highest court of a state or federal district. While some judge advocates have prior enlisted or commissioned experience, most are direct commissioned and have no prior military training or experience. Acceptance into the Army JAG Corps is highly selective with an acceptance rate between 4-7%. In 2017, the Army JAG Corps accepted 200 out of 4,000 applicants. Initial entry training into the JAG Corps is composed of two phases: * 6-week Direct Commission Course (DCC) at Fort Benning, Georgia * 11-week Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course (JAOBC) at The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School (TJAGLCS) As of the summer of 2013, JAOBC Phase I, formerly conducted at Fort Lee, Virginia is no longer a requirement for JAOBC students. Students now report directly to DCC in Fort Benning, and upon completion of DCC travel to Charlottesville for JAOBC. From 2006 until the end of 2009, students attended the JAOBC Phase I at Fort Lee, Virginia, followed by the JAOBC in Charlottesville. Students then attended a 4-week DCC at Fort Benning, Georgia or Fort Sill, Oklahoma, followed immediately by the 6 1/2-week Basic Officer Leaders Course, or BOLC II. BOLC II was discontinued at the end of 2009. JAG Corps warrant officer legal administrators are accessed from the enlisted population through a competitive accession board of officers. That board of officers make a recommendation to The Judge Advocate General using an order of merit list of recommended selections, The Judge Advocate General has final authority on the process. To be considered by the board, they must have at least an associate degree; five years experience as a paralegal (MOS 27D); recommendations from their staff judge advocate, legal administrator and their senior/chief paralegal; and completion of several correspondence courses. Once accessed, the warrant officer candidate will complete 4‚Äì6 weeks of warrant officer candidate school at the Warrant Officer Career College located at Fort Rucker, Alabama. Their follow-on schooling will be at The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, Charlottesville, VA for 6 weeks. JAG Corps enlisted paralegals must earn qualifying scores on the ASVAB, and be able to maintain a SECRET security clearance. Insignia The branch insignia consists of a gold quill crossed above a gold sword, superimposed over a laurel wreath. The pen signifies the recording of testimony, the sword represents the military character of the JAG Corps, and the wreath indicates honor. The insignia was created in May 1890 in silver and changed to gold in 1899. The regimental distinctive insignia (commonly but erroneously referred to as a \\"crest\\") contains the branch insignia on a shield of azure (dark blue), bordered argent (silver), the regimental colors. The \\"1775\\" on the ribbon below the shields refers to the year of the Corps' establishment.

The number needed to harm (NNH) is an epidemiological measure that indicates how many persons on average need to be exposed to a risk factor over a specific period to cause harm in an average of one person who would not otherwise have been harmed. It is defined as the inverse of the absolute risk increase, and computed as 1/(I_e - I_u), where I_e is the incidence in the treated (exposed) group, and I_u is the incidence in the control (unexposed) group. Intuitively, the lower the number needed to harm, the worse the risk factor, with 1 meaning that every exposed person is harmed. NNH is similar to number needed to treat (NNT), where NNT usually refers to a therapeutic intervention and NNH to a detrimental effect or a risk factor.  Relevance  The NNH is an important measure in evidence- based medicine and helps physicians decide whether it is prudent to proceed with a particular treatment which may expose the patient to harms while providing therapeutic benefits. If a clinical endpoint is devastating enough without the drug (e.g. death, heart attack), drugs with a low NNH may still be indicated in particular situations if the NNT is smaller than the NNH. However, there are several important problems with the NNH, involving bias and lack of reliable confidence intervals, as well as difficulties in excluding the possibility of no difference between two treatments or groups.

The mission of UMST is to serve the educational needs of Sudanese, African and Arab students. It is located in the Riyad district of Khartoum. It first opened its doors in 1995 with a student body of only forty students and two faculties. In 2017 it had become home to 5,000-6,000 students and costs US$15,000 for the school of medicine in 2018. The university has 14 faculties. In 2014 the University stated that 60% of its students were foreign.  History  The UMST began as a private, non-profit making educational Academy, in Khartoum, Sudan in 1996. UMST was established by Professor Mamoun Homeida former vice-chancellor at the University of Khartoum (and later Minister of Health for Khartoum State). Homeida also recruited several faculty members from the University of Khartoum. Since then, the Academy expanded to 14 undergraduate faculties, namely, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory Sciences, Radiological Sciences, Anaesthesia, Nursing Technology, Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology, Business Administration, Economics Social and Environmental Studies, Mass Communication, and Law. It also has a School of Nursing Technology and offers 14 Masters degree programs, four PhD programs and four postgraduate diplomas. It became a full university in 2007. Annual student undergraduate fees for the year 2016-2017 ranged from US$1,500 (Nursing Diploma) to US$15,000 (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery). Local Sudanese and international students pay the same fees. From 2014-2017 there were reports that about 20 students at UMST had been recruited by an organisation called the Islamic Cultural Organisation (ICO) to join ISIS. ICO was banned by Mamoun Homeida and UMST was not regarded by the British Medical Journal as a university particularly exposed to radical Islamic influences.  Faculty of Medicine  In Sudan, endemic diseases, mainly of tropical nature, constitute a significant cause of diseases and lay an extra burden on medical students learning. With these challenges in mind, the Faculty of Medicine was established in 1996. The Faculty of Medicine is equipped with lecture theatres and laboratories (Biochemistry, Physiology, Physics, Dissection room, Biology/Molecular biology and Skills laboratory). The Teaching Hospital and a number of health centers were established to receive the students. Two specialized high-tech diagnostic/treatment clinics were opened to receive the students for training: Yastabshiroon Centre where imaging techniques are housed, e.g., MRI, Spiral CT, ultrasound and echo scan, EEG, EMG, endoscopy with laparoscopic surgery, laser treatment facilities. UMST offers BM and BS undergraduate degrees in medicine, several MSc degrees (including Public and Tropical Health) and postgraduate diplomas in HIV/AIDS, Epidemiology And Biostatistics and Research Methodology and Biostatistics.  Faculty of Dentistry  The school of Dentistry was established in 1997 as part of Faculty of Medicine but was renamed Faculty of Dentistry in 1998 after expansion of buildings and departments. The Faculty of Dentistry conducts a course of studies leading the degree of Bachelor of Dental Surgery (B.D.S.) to students who satisfy the regulations and successfully pass the examinations undertaken during five academic years. The Faculty of Dentistry is located at the Academy Charity Teaching Hospital (ACTH), in Elimtidad, Khartoum, and among a heavily populated residential area which guarantees an excellent catchments of patients for training of students and within reach of transport facilities from the centre of Khartoum. The dental clinic equipped with dental units (one unit per student) is within the main outpatient department of ACTH .

In 2010, Doherty won the Republican nomination for Illinois State Senate District 10 to replace retiring Senator James DeLeo (D-Chicago), but he lost the general election to John Mulroe. Doherty did not seek re-election after his defeat in the Senate contest and left office in 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/us/13cncpulse.html Political career While on the City Council, Doherty had a record of opposing property tax increases. Political columnist Russ Stewart wrote, \\"Doherty has opposed the Daley Administration on every tax hike ordinance.\\" He voted for a sunshine ordinance that aimed to make it easier to determine how taxpayer dollars are spent on Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts. He also established a Zoning Advisory Board to give residents a voice in local zoning issues. Doherty was notable as the only member of the Republican Party in the Chicago City Council, but supported some of the policies of Chicago's Democratic Mayor Richard M. Daley. Doherty voted in favor of the mayor's parking meter plan that leases out the revenue rights to a private firm. According to the Chicago Tribune, the plan would increase the hourly meter rate at some Chicago parking meters to $6.50 in 2013.http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/12/aldermen-deba-1.html In 1986, Doherty ran in the at-large election to be a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners from the city of Chicago, succeeding in the primary to be one of ten Republican nominees, but losing the general election.

He was given the title of Lord of Tyre in 1291, shortly before the city of Tyre fell to the Mamluks of Egypt. He is often but incorrectly called the Prince of Tyre. In April 1306, with the support of the barons, Amalric forced his brother Henry II to ceded authority to him. He thereafter governed Cyprus as \\"rector, governor and administrator\\", effectively regent, until his assassination. Life Amalric was at the Fall of Tripoli in 1289, in which he led a company of knights and four galleys from Cyprus.Runciman, p.406 He escaped the siege of Tripoli together with Lucia of Tripoli, and was made Constable of Jerusalem in April 1289. In 1290, he became Lord of Tyre. He was the officer in command of the Accursed Tower at the siege of Acre in 1291, and escaped the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem with his brother, King Henry II.

When his brother Henry became unpopular in Cyprus, Amalric overthrew him with the aid of the Knights Templar and some of the barons, assuming the titles of \\"Governor and Rector\\" on April 26, 1306. The overthrow was not violent; Henry had few supporters, and was simply taken away and confined at Strovolos. Amalric's rule was initially popular, and he repaired relations with Venice, Genoa, and the Hospitallers. However, when the Order of the Knights Templar was being suppressed in 1307, he was compelled to obey the Papal directive to arrest local Templars, which resulted in a small uprising in favor of Henry in January 1308. It quickly collapsed, but Amalric was forced to arrest a number of nobles, including Rupen of Montfort, John of Dampierre, and various members of the Ibelin family. In April, two of the Ibelins were exiled to Armenia, and John of Dampierre was mortally wounded by a mob after attempting to communicate with King Henry. In February 1310, Amalric sent Henry into exile in Armenia. Amalric was murdered by Simon of Montolif at Nicosia on June 5, 1310, and buried at Santa Sophia, at Nicosia. On his death, his brother Aimery was proclaimed Governor of Nicosia, but was soon defeated and imprisoned, and Henry restored to his throne. Family In 1292/1293 Amalric married Cilician Armenian princess Isabella in the city of Nicosia. They had five sons and one daughter: * Hugh (died between 1318 & April 9, 1323, Cilicia), Lord of Crusoche, married to Eschiva of Ibelin (died after March 1324). * Henry (murdered before April 9, 1323, Cilicia), unmarried * Guy (d. April 17, 1344, Armenia), King of Armenia as Constantine II. He married firstly to a woman from Kantakouzenos family; secondly to Theodora Syrgiannaina. From his second marriage he had  Isabelle/Zampea of Poitiers- Lusignan, who married Manuel Kantakouzenos despot of Morea. * John (murdered August 7, 1343, Cilicia), sometime Constable and Regent of Cilicia, died 1346, children:  Bohemond (died Venice, 1364)  Leon V of Armenia, probably an extramarital child, whose mother Soldane was claimed by the chronicler Jean Dardel to have been John's wife and a daughter of a Georgian king. * Boh√©mond (murdered April 17, 1344, Cilicia), Count of Corcyus, Lord of Korikos (1336), married in 1340 Euphemia of Neghir (1325 - aft. 1381, Jerusalem), daughter of Baldwin of Neghir, Marshal of Armenia, and had a bastard son:  Barthelemy, Co-Regent of Armenia (died after 1373), unmarried and without issue * Agnes (Mary) (d. aft. 1309), married c. 1305 or 1305/1306 Leo III of Armenia (1297 - murdered 1307), without children After Amalric's death, his widow and children remained in Armenia; only his daughter would die a natural death, his widow and sons all being murdered at various times.

The tampering involved using a call center to jam the phone lines of a get out the vote (GOTV) operation. In the end, 900 calls were made for 45 minutes of disruption to the Democratic-leaning call centers. During that state's 2002 election for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Republican Bob Smith, the NHGOP hired GOP Marketplace, based in northern Virginia, to jam another phone bank being used by the state Democratic Party and the firefighters' union for efforts to turn out voters on behalf of then-Governor of New Hampshire Jeanne Shaheen on Election Day. John E. Sununu, the Republican nominee, won a narrow victory. In addition to criminal prosecutions, disclosures in the case have come from a civil suit filed by the state's Democratic Party against the state's Republican Party (now settled). Four men were convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, federal crimes and sentenced to prison for their involvement. One conviction was reversed by an appeals court, a decision prosecutors are appealing. James Tobin, freed on appeal, was later indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during the original investigation. History =The scandal breaks= Police in Concord, the state capital, were notified by Democratic workers on the day of the election that they were receiving repeated telephone calls, terminating after five seconds, which were interfering with their efforts to reach voters and offer rides to the polls. For at least an hour and a half at midday they were unable to make any outgoing calls. Verizon was later able to stop most of these calls, but whoever had made them had violated state laws against telephone harassment. State authorities found the calls came from out of state, and so brought in their federal counterparts. They were eventually traced to Mylo Enterprises, a Pocatello, Idaho-based company that ran phone banks. The New Hampshire Union Leader reported on it February 7, 2003. The story forced the resignation of state GOP executive director Charles McGee shortly afterward, when he admitted lying to the paper. Later, prosecutors said that he had come up with the idea of disrupting Democratic communications after seeing a flyer put out by the Shaheen campaign with the numbers. Drawing on his military background, he decided to disrupt \\"enemy communications\\" and called several telemarketing firms he knew to have Republican sympathies. However, James Tobin, then Northeast field director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), put McGee in touch with GOP Marketplace, a northern Virginia firm run by Allen Raymond, which had been hired by the New Hampshire party for similar voter-turnout efforts. McGee had lied in claiming to be unaware of this. Steve Kornacki of politicsnj.com discovered that Raymond, a New Jersey native, had worked for James Treffinger, a former gubernatorial candidate then under indictment for a phone scandal during that state's 2001 Republican primary for the senatorial nomination, in which calls were made smearing two of his opponents. A prominent figure in that indictment, possibly a co-conspirator, was an unnamed Republican consultant believed to be Raymond (during the later trial of James Tobin, the prosecution said that GOP Marketplace had worked for a Senate campaign in New Jersey and that that work had led to a criminal indictment). During Super Bowl XXXVI on February 3, 2002, Raymond's firm had placed calls to prospective voters that not only attacked one of Treffinger's rivals but purported to be from another. =Guilty pleas= Little was heard about the case until June 30, 2004, when Allen Raymond pleaded guilty to several felony charges in federal court in Concord. McGee followed suit the next month. Josh Marshall's blog noted that Todd Hinnen, the prosecutor in Raymond's case, indicated to the court that Raymond had been contacted about the phone jamming idea by \\"a former colleague who was then an official in a national political organization.\\" Hinnen later indicated that McGee discussed the phone-jamming plan with two other top Republican officials. In an op-ed for the Concord Monitor, Smith called the phone jamming \\"an outrage\\" and deplored the lack of Republican anger over \\"this despicable action by pathetic political hacks.\\" He also implied that the phone jamming may have denied Shaheen victory. =The third man= In October, an affidavit filed by the New Hampshire Democratic Party and released to the media contained information that made it possible to identify the third man as Tobin, then serving as the New England regional director for the Bush campaign. He resigned October 15 and was indicted December 1, then arraigned December 13 on two criminal counts each of conspiring to make harassing telephone calls and aiding and abetting telephone harassment. =Sentences= Allen Raymond was sentenced to five months in federal prison on February 8, 2005, for his role. A month later, Charles McGee received seven months. =James Tobin trial and financing= James Tobin refused to cooperate with investigators as his trial approached. During Tobin's trial, questions arose about the source of the money involved in funding the phone jamming and his defense. In July, the Union Leader reported that one of Tobin's attorneys told the court he was representing the defendant in his capacity as an employee of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Since the RNC had stated that Tobin was acting on his own in a rogue operation, it was asked why they would be paying for his defense. In August, the RNC finally confirmed that it had spent more than $722,000 for Tobin's defense by the Washington firm of Williams & Connolly. \\"This support is based on his assurance and our belief that Jim has not engaged in any wrongdoing,\\" a spokesperson told the Associated Press. The Union Leader reported in February 2006 that the RNC had paid $1.7 million to Williams on the day Tobin was sentenced, for a total of $2.5 million, and would neither confirm nor deny that it was still paying his legal expenses. The RNC's first financial report of 2006 indicated that it by then had spent another $330,000. Later that year, Tobin's wife was hired by the NRSC as a consultant on the unsuccessful re- election campaign of Rhode Island senator Lincoln Chafee, as Northeast Strategies, a company that listed the Tobins' home as its main address. Despite her lack of any previous experience, she was paid at $300,000. On August 28, Marshall reported that two Indian tribes, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and the Mississippi Choctaw, known clients of influential lobbyist Jack Abramoff, himself at the center of a widening scandal, had made $5,000 contributions (the legal maximum) to the NHGOP the week of the election in 2002. Neither was known to have any interest in New Hampshire. Later, staffers for Judd Gregg, New Hampshire's senior senator and also a Republican, explained that they had passed along the checks without his knowledge. Also unusual was over $600,000 contributed to the Sununu campaign over the final week by the National Republican Congressional Committee, which normally focuses on races in the House and had not shown much interest in previous campaigns by Sununu. Texas congressman and former House majority leader Tom DeLay's Americans for a Republican Majority political action committee (ARMPAC) also contributed $5,000. On November 10, Judge Steven McAuliffe denied Also published by The Boston Globe as \\"Tobin asks court to dismiss phone jamming charges\\". Tobin's last motion to dismiss the conspiracy charges against him, although he said he would consider another motion to dismiss charges that Tobin denied others their right to vote. Shortly before the trial started, Marshall reportedTalking Points Memo  that the state's witness list included Terry Nelson, former political director for the Bush campaign. Nelson had been linked to the scandal involving DeLay's illegal fundraising in Texas. James Tobin =Background= James Tobin was President George W. Bush's New England campaign chairman. He was convicted on December 15, 2005, of telephone harassment \\"for his part in a plot to jam the Democratic Party's phones on Election Day 2002\\". However, this conviction was later overturned by a federal appeals court and Tobin was acquitted on all charges. As New England campaign chairman for Bush-Cheney '04 Inc., Tobin stepped down two weeks before the election when state Democrats accused him of involvement in a phone-jamming scheme on Election Day 2002. Tobin was later indicted for conspiracy. Tobin served as national political director for publisher Steve Forbes' Presidential campaign. He is an employee of the Washington, D.C.-based DCI Group and also has his own consulting firm, Tobin & Co., based in Bangor, Maine. During the 2004 election cycle he was a Bush Ranger, raising at least $200,000 for the Bush 2004 reelection effort. =Tobin's alleged involvement in election phone jamming= In November 2002, Tobin was regional director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. On election day, computerized hang-up calls jammed phone lines set up by the New Hampshire Democratic Party and the Manchester firefighters' union. Over 800 phone calls were made to a get-out-the-vote phone bank over the course of two hours. The United States Senate contest in New Hampshire was between Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Rep. John E. Sununu. Sununu won by about 20,000 votes. Tobin and NSRCC political director Chris LaCivita had worked together at DCI Group, a Washington GOP lobbying and public relations firm, along with Brian McCabe, a GOP activist who formerly worked in several roles in New Hampshire, including as a campaign manager for former U.S. Rep. Bill Zeliff. At the time, the NSRCC was chaired by then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. Phone records show Tobin made two dozen calls to the White House Office of Political Affairs within a three-day period around Election Day 2002. A number of observers have noted that contact between the White House Office of Political Affairs and presidential campaign staff is historically commonplace for Democratic and Republican administrations. =Trial= During the summer of 2004, Charles McGee, former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and admitted paying $15,600 to an Alexandria, Virginia telemarketing company, GOP Marketplace, that hired another business to make the calls. A co-owner of that firm at the time, Shaun Hansen, was indicted in March. Republican consultant Allen Raymond, GOP Marketplace's former president, also pleaded guilty in the summer to a conspiracy charge in federal court. Tobin's trial began on December 6, 2005. The first day apparently went well for the defense, when key prosecution witness Chuck McGee seemed to back away from testimony he had agreed to make in exchange for plea bargains. McGee's testimony suggested that the DCI Group, a powerful public relations firm which publishes the Tech Central Station website and is closely connected to the Republican party, was involved through lawyer and New Hampshire native Brian McCabe. He also said he had talked to Darrell Henry of the American Gas Association, who said that he would keep the phone jamming going after it was officially called off. Henry, McGee said, had offered to keep the operation going with some volunteers from \\"the chamber\\". Since Tobin's superior at the NRSC, Chris LaCivita, worked at the time for the United States Chamber of Commerce, it is possible that he, too, had foreknowledge of the plan. He currently works for Terry Nelson's consulting firm, Crosslink Strategy Group. Raymond said he'd also run the idea past Kenneth Gross, a former associate general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, currently a partner in the powerful firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. On December 8, Tobin's defense presented two witnesses and rested. They persuaded McAuliffe to drop one charge and narrow the scope of another. A week later, the jury convicted him of two counts related to telephone harassment, while acquitting him of the more serious charge of conspiracy to violate voters' rights. In May 2006, prosecutors asked for a two-year prison sentence. They cited three factors: Tobin's abuse of a public and private trust, the making of multiple calls to multiple victims over a prolonged period of time, and the ultimate purpose of interfering with an election. The first two are specifically addressed by the telephone-harassment statute; the latter is not but, the prosecutors said, so egregious an end that it warranted more severe punishment. Tobin was sentenced on May 17, 2006, to 10 months in prison, two years probation, and $10,000 in fines. The trial left the New Hampshire Republican Party nearly bankrupt, with only $733.60 in its bank account. Later that year, Democratic candidates upset both of the state's incumbent Republican congressmen. =RNC defense= In August, the RNC confirmed that it had spent more than $722,000 for Tobin's defense by the Washington, D.C. firm of Williams & Connolly. \\"This support is based on his assurance and our belief that Jim has not engaged in any wrongdoing\\", a spokesperson told the Associated Press. The Union Leader reported in February 2006 that the RNC had paid $1.7 million to Williams on the day Tobin was sentenced, for a total of $2.5 million, and would neither confirm nor deny that it was still paying his legal expenses. The RNC's first financial report of 2006 indicated that it by then spent another $330,000. Later that year, Tobin's wife and her partner, a long time New England political operative, were hired by the Lincoln Chafee campaign as consultants on the unsuccessful re-election campaign of Rhode Island senator Lincoln Chafee, as Northeast Strategies, a company that listed the Tobins' home as its main address. Tobin, who had worked on two previous high-profile campaigns in Maine, and her partner who had managed six previous campaigns were paid $300,000 to consult on the campaign. Of that, $260,000 went to paying for the mail for the Chafee campaign. =Conviction reversed on appeal= On December 21, Tobin's lawyers filed documents in U.S. District Court in Concord, New Hampshire, seeking to vacate the jury's verdict and demanding a new trial for Tobin. A month later, a more detailed filing laid out three possible errors: * McGee and Raymond went ahead with the plan after talking with Tobin, not before, suggesting it was their decision alone. * Tobin could not be shown to have assented to the element of the plan that called for repeated hangup calls. * There was no evidence of an agreement to proceed before McGee consulted the NHGOP chair and Raymond sought an attorney's advice. * All the trial evidence showed was that Tobin referred McGee to Raymond. On March 20, 2007, Chief Judge Michael Boudin of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that the statute under which Tobin was convicted \\"is not a close fit\\" for what Tobin did, and questioned whether the government showed that Tobin intended to harass. However, it did not void the conviction entirely as Tobin's lawyers sought, saying that conspiracy jurisprudence did not require the level of proof Tobin claimed it did. It remanded it to district court for retrial, believing that a properly instructed jury could possibly return a conviction on the basis of his actions alone.http://betsydevine.com/blog/wp- content/uploads/2007/03/20070321opinion.rtf Federal prosecutors said they were reviewing the decision to consider whether to appeal it in turn, or retry. The court of appeals later affirmed the dismissal of the charges, notwithstanding Tobin's ‚Äúthoroughly bad‚Äù conduct. United States v. Tobin, 552 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2009). =2008 Tobin indictment= After over a year of no further legal or investigative developments, on October 9, 2008, a federal grand jury in Maine indicted Tobin anew on two counts of making false statements to FBI agents. At that time Shaheen and Sununu were reprising their 2002 race, which Shaheen won. Also published by the Bangor Daily News as \\"Tobin faces new charges\\". These subsequent charges were summarily dismissed in 2009 after the federal judge in Maine's District Court found them motivated by \\"vindictive prosecution\\". The judge held that the government could not overcome the legal presumption that the post-appeal charges arising from the same conduct were \\"vindictive\\" under United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 372 (1982) and Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 (1978). That is because the new indictment was returned only after the government lost its appeal in United States v. Tobin, 480 F.3d 53, 54-55 (1st Cir.2007), raising a presumption that new prosecution was a response to Tobin's successful exercise of his appellate rights. See United States v. Tobin, 598 F.Supp.2d 125 (D.Me. 2009). The district court found this to be a due process violation. Id. at 129-132. The Appeals Court later dismissed the prosecution's appeal on the government's own motion. Other developments Noel Hillman, who was credited with moving the case to trial as head of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, was nominated for a federal judgeship by President Bush in January 2006. Also that month, the NHGOP filed a countersuit against the state's Democratic Party, alleging that the Democratic lawsuit against them was merely part of a national effort to advance the party's interests in an election year and that the Democrats were abusing the court process to hinder NHGOP's efforts to engage in constitutionally protected political activities. On December 1, the two parties settled for a total of $125,000, payable by the Republicans to the Democrats, in $25,000 annual installments over the next five years. The RNC and NRSC will also each make two $5,000 contributions to charities associated with the Manchester fire and police departments. Charles McGee served seven months in prison, and now works at campaign school for GOP candidates, run by a Republican political marketing firm. =White House connections= A Democratic analysis of phone records introduced at Tobin's criminal trial show he made 115 outgoing calls to the White House between September 17 and November 22, 2002.http://www.senatemajority.com/files/EXHIBITA.pdf Two dozen of the calls were made from 9:28 a.m. the day before the election through 2:17 a.m. the night after the voting, a three-day period during which the phone jamming operation was finalized, carried out, and then abruptly shut down. Virtually all the calls to the White House went to the same number, which currently rings inside the political affairs office. In 2002, that office was headed by Ken Mehlman, who later became the chair of the Republican National Committee. The White House declined to say which staffer was assigned that phone number. The national Republican Party, which has continued to pay millions in legal bills to defend Tobin, says the phone calls involved routine election business and that it was \\"preposterous\\" to suggest the calls involved phone jamming. Also published by ABC News as \\"Phone-Jamming Records Point to White House\\". Mehlman said that the calls were simply part of the many he and his assistant made to field operatives in competitive races all over the country during that time period. Later in April, the state Democratic Party asked Phillip Mangones, the judge presiding over its lawsuit against NHGOP, to allow them to question Mehlman. An activist said Mehlman's explanation that it was routine election-day campaign business is hard to reconcile with records showing Tobin continued to call Mehlman's office long after the election was decided in Sununu's favor. Republican consultant Joe Gaylord accused the Democrats of \\"trying to stir up crap.\\" =Haley Barbour connection= On April 28, 2006, the Associated Press reported that Haley Barbour, the former RNC chair now serving as governor of Mississippi, had provided a $250,000 startup loan to GOP Marketplace through his investment company, HELM Partners, in 2000. While he claimed that his involvement ended there and that he had no idea at the time that the company would ever engage in criminal activity, its operating agreementhttp://www.senatemajority.com/files/GOPMKTPLACEOPERATINGAGREEMENTFULL.pdf shows that HELM retained a great deal of control over the company through a different class of stock and that Barbour's partner Ed Rogers had, as a result, equal control of the company with Raymond. Further investigations showed that HELM had only been incorporated shortly before GOP Marketplace was started and that the partnership never invested in any other company. Raymond also owned two-thirds of the company despite his initial investment of only $11,700. Shaun Hansen On March 27, 2006, Shaun Hansen, the former owner of Mylo, traveled from Idaho to New Hampshire to face one count each of conspiracy to commit telephone harassment and aiding and abetting telephone harassment. Prosecutors allege that he agreed to use his firm to jam six phone numbers with hangup calls on the day of the election for $2,500. Unlike Tobin, Hansen's defense has not been paid for by any entities associated with the Republican Party. Instead, he was represented by the federal public defender's office. The listing of possible defenses he might employ, as listed in his first filing, suggests he may have been led to believe, by Tobin and others, that the jamming was perfectly legal.http://www.senatemajority.com/node/425 He pleaded guilty and was due to be sentenced in February 2007.

The fort was established in 1824, soon after Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain. It was an important post during the Seminole Wars and of lesser importance during the United States Civil War. It was decommissioned in 1883, and the land was eventually sold to private interests. Fort Brooke was located on what is now the southern end of downtown Tampa along the Garrison Channel. It stretched approximately from the current location of the Tampa Bay History Center on the east to the Tampa Convention Center on the west, and Amalie Arena, Cotanchobee/Fort Brooke Park, two large hotels, and other structures have been built in its footprint. Unmapped army and Seminole cemeteries along with many artifacts were discovered during various construction projects. The soldiers' remains were re-interred at the Florida National Cemetery in Bushnell, the native remains were transferred to the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the artifacts were given to the Tampa Bay History Center and other institutions for research and preservation. Fort Brooke as a military outpost In 1823, Colonels George Mercer Brooke and James Gadsden of the United States Army were ordered to establish a military presence on Tampa Bay in the newly acquired Florida Territory to contain the Seminole Indians according to the Treaty of Moultrie Creek and to curtail illegal activities along the Gulf coast. On 10 January 1824, Brooke and four full companies of the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment from Pensacola established \\"Cantonment Brooke\\" at the mouth of the Hillsborough River, just about where today's Tampa Convention Center sits in downtown Tampa. The site was marked by a huge hickory tree atop an ancient Indian mound, most likely built by the Tocobaga culture centuries before. Brooke directed his troops to clear the area for the construction of a wooden log fort and support buildings, but he ordered that several ancient live oak trees inside the encampment be spared to provide shade and cheer. In 1824, the post was officially rechristened Fort Brooke. Fort Brooke would serve as a major outpost on Florida's west coast during all three Seminole Indian Wars and the Civil War. The fort also played a part in the development of the village of Tampa. In October 1863, the small Civil War Battle of Fort Brooke was fought nearby. On May 6, 1864, both Fort Brooke and Tampa were captured by Union forces. As Tampa languished during the 1870s and early 1880s, so did Fort Brooke. The last roll call of soldiers occurred in 1882 and the post was decommissioned by the U.S. Army in 1883. Closure and as incorporated town After the fort's closure, most of the land was open to homesteaders, and some garrison buildings remained on site.Rajtar, p. 17. Shortly after the post was decommissioned, Fort Brooke became an independent incorporated town in 1885. Fort Brooke was annexed by Tampa in 1907.Rajtar, p. 17.

It is the most abundant seabird in North America, and one of the most abundant in the world, with a population of around nine million birds. They breed on the islands of Alaska and Siberia, and spend the winter close to the edge of the ice sheet. Their largest colonies are on the Aleutian Islands, St. Lawrence Island and Little Diomede Island. Diet and feeding Least auklets feed predominantly on calanoid copepods, particularly those of the genus Neocalanus. They also eat euphausiids, pteropods and other zooplankton species. They hunt for these in stratified waters caused where upwelling and thermoclines cause these prey items to be tightly clumped together. Like all auks they are pursuit divers, using their wings to provide thrust and \\"fly\\" under the water. They are voracious predators, consuming 86% of their body weight each day. Breeding Least auklets are highly colonial, nesting in rocky crevices in colonies of up to a million birds. These colonies are often mixed, with other species of auklet nesting with, and competing with the least auklets. While this coexistence with other species may bring the benefits of protection from predators, least auklets are vulnerable to being displaced from their nesting sites by the larger crested auklets. A single egg is laid in the crevice and incubated for a month, after which a semi-precocial black downy chick is hatched. Both parents share incubation duties, as well as brooding and feeding duties. Unlike many auks, which are fed fish carried crosswise in the bill, chicks of the least auklet are fed copepods and other zooplankton from a sublingual pouch, as are other small auklets. The chicks receive no further parental care after they fledge, and can dive to hunt as soon as they leave the nest. Status and conservation Staffer from the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge holding a least auklet Least auklets are vulnerable to oil spills and introduced species. The introduction of Arctic foxes to many of the Aleutian Islands caused the species to be wiped out on many of those islands, and rats are also a problem on many islands. However, at present they are still a very common species, and are not considered threatened by the IUCN. References * * Jones, I. L. 1993. Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla).

Originating in Samoa (English missionaries introduced their game of cricket in the early 19th century), it spread throughout Polynesia and can now be found around the world in areas with strong Polynesian populations. The game is the national sport of Samoa, and is played in many other Pacific countries, including amongst the Pacific Islander diaspora in New Zealand. Form of the game =Equipment= The ball is made of a very hard rubber wrapped in pandanus. Players are not protected by any padding or masks, and will often wear only a lava-lava. The sennit-wrapped wooden bat is modeled on the three-sided Samoan war club called the \\"lapalapa,\\" which are based on the stalk of coconut fronds. Bats are shaped to individual players' likings and can be over a meter long; because the striking surface of the bat is angled (just as the \\"lapalapa\\" club and the coconut frond stalk), the path of a hit ball is extremely hard to predict. =Rules= The rules of kilikiti are flexible. Indeed, the majority of reports written on the game simply say that the rules can only be known by those playing. When played in provincial New Zealand ‚Äúdoing a Ramesh‚Äù is when the batsmen forgets to take strike and is bowled without playing a shot. All the fielders complete the obligatory dance move, historically associated with Morcambe & Wise, ‚ÄúBring me Sunshine‚Äù Similarities to cricket There is a batting team, a fielding team, and a pitch (sometimes of concrete). The bowl alternates between two bowlers, one at each end of the pitch; accordingly, there are two wicket keepers (this as opposed to the single wicket keeper in cricket). Major points on which kilikiti differs from cricket There is no limit to team size, and teams are made up of whoever turns up regardless of gender or age. Tourist accounts mention that strangers are often welcomed. Players are typically all-rounders. A kilikiti game is a multi-day community event full of singing, dancing, and feasting. Entire villages will compete and everyone will be involved, whether as player, cook, or spectator. (According to one source, the only universal rule is that the host team forfeits if it cannot provide enough food.) Standardization The New Zealand Kilikiti Association (NZKA) is working to standardize the rules of kilikiti. In 1999 the NZKA started a national tournament, called the Supercific Kilikiti Tournament, and in 2001 it introduced the international World Cup Kilikiti Tournament. Games have been cut to a television-friendly 70 minutes (2 innings, the first being 30 minutes long and the second bowling the same number of balls as the first). The NZKA has also added the scoring of 4s and 6s.

It is accessed from Princes Street, on its north side, and flanked by North Bridge and Waverley Steps. The latter gives pedestrian access to Waverley Station to the south, to which in was formerly linked. The former railway hotel from across Waverly Station  History  North elevation, seen across Princes Street past the Iron Duke of Wellington in bronze by alt= Resulting from a competition in 1895,Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Colin McWilliam the hotel originally opened as the North British Station Hotel on 15 October 1902. The building's architecture is Victorian, influenced by the traditional Scottish baronial style. It was designed by architect William Hamilton Beattie and for most of the twentieth century was known as the North British Hotel or simply the N.B., a traditional railway hotel built for the North British Railway Company adjacent to their newly rebuilt Waverley station. While under railway ownership, the hotel had porters in red jackets who would take passengers and their luggage directly into the hotel via a lift. Ownership passed into the hands of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the hotel became part of British Transport Hotels until it was privatised and purchased by The Gleneagles Hotel Company in 1983.https://www.roccofortehotels.com/media-centre/press-releases/the- balmoral/edinburghs-iconic-landmark-hotel-celebrates-110-years-at-the- capitals-most-prestigous-address/ In 1988, the hotel closed for a major refurbishment and the building was purchased in 1990 by Balmoral International Hotels. On 12 June 1991, Edinburgh-born actor Sean Connery officially re- opened the hotel as The Balmoral, Gaelic for 'majestic dwelling', following a ¬£23,000,000 refurbishment. A plaque to commemorate the occasion appears in the hotel lobby beside the lifts. The hotel then became part of the Forte Group forming part of their \\"Forte Grand\\" collection of international high-end hotels. Following a hostile takeover of Forte Group in 1996 by Granada plc, The Balmoral was put up for sale by its new owners and in a twist of irony, became the first hotel purchased by the newly formed Rocco Forte Hotels created by Sir Rocco Forte in 1997, following the takeover of their former business by Granada plc, effectively repurchasing one of Forte Group's hotels. Its traditional rival has always been The Caledonian Hotel at the west end of Princes Street; this was once the station hotel for the now-demolished Princes Street station of the Caledonian Railway, which was North British Railway's principal rival railway company.  The Balmoral Clock  Since 1902, the hotel's clock has been set three minutes fast to ensure that the people of Edinburgh wouldn't miss their trains. This is still the case today. The only day that the clock runs on time is on 31 December (Hogmanay) for the city's New Year celebrations.Scotland's clock that's (almost) never on time, Mike MacEacheran, BBC 14 September 2018 The clock tower, at high, forms a prominent landmark in Edinburgh's city centre.

The room has since been renamed the \\"J.K. Rowling Suite,\\" and the marble bust has been placed in a glass display case to protect it. The suite, priced at nearly ¬£1,000 per night, is a pilgrimage site for Harry Potter fans. Oprah (2010) Balmoral Clock Tower In October 2010, Oprah Winfrey filmed a one-hour episode of Oprah at The Balmoral. She interviewed J. K. Rowling from room 230, the Scone & Crombie Royal Suite. Oprah asked Rowling: \\"Is there anything particularly here at this hotel where we are, that you thought would be particularly stimulating to your creative process?\\", to which Rowling replied: > It turned out to be stimulating.

This measure is often monitored and used by government or other organisations as a benchmark for the wage level of individual workers in an industry, area or country. The usefulness of this measure in assessing wage levels is debatable, particularly in an economy where low pay is prevalent, due to the tendency for the wages of a minority of high earners to 'skew' the average upwards. It has been argued that the median (midpoint) worker's wage is a better indicator in these circumstances; this measure is used in the UK by both the Office for National Statistics and the Scottish Low Pay Unit in examining wage levels. Certain UK organisations, usually socialist or left-of-centre political groups, have traditionally had a policy that members should never accept wages higher than the wage of the average working class person whilst being employed by that organisation or in a representative capacity. Deputies and officials paid an average worker's wage are also a feature of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat described in Marx's account of the Paris Commune, The Civil War in France, as well as in Lenin's The State and Revolution commentary on Marx's pamphlet, although not all people who draw an average workers wage subscribe to Marxist principles. This idea is based on the idea that politicians (or trade union officials) are there to serve the people of the country rather than earn themselves a fortune and/or raise their status (also known as careerism). Proponents claim that high wages for politicians are a waste of taxpayers' money and distance the politician from the concerns of the working class. Examples of people taking only an average worker's wage are Socialist Party politician Joe Higgins, former MP Dave Nellist in the UK, John Marek, Forward Wales' Welsh Assembly member for Wrexham, and Sinn F√©in politicians in Ireland. In The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, Robert Tressell notes that the Labour Representation Committee MPs of the day took only an average workers' wage.

In 1929, the institution formally established the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra as its resident orchestra, with Albert Stoessel as its first music director of the orchestra, from 1929 through his death in 1943. Simultaneously, Stossel directed opera activities and the school of music at Chautauqua. Successors to Stossel included Franco Autori (1943-1953) and Walter Hendl (1953-1972), the latter the longest-serving music director of the ensemble. Since July 2015, the current music director is Rossen Milanov, whom the Chautauqua Institution appointed to the post in October 2014. In September 2015, the Chautauqua Institution announced the extension of Milanov's contract through 2019.

Early life and family Scarborough was born in England. His father, Capt. Edmund Scarborough (1584-1635), was a barrister and graduate of Caius College, and an army captain, who emigrated to Virginia about 1621. He settled on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with his family around 1628, and represented the Accomac Shire in the Virginia General Assembly in the 1630s.Kukla, pp. 40-41 A brother, Sir Charles Scarborough, remained in England, became a noted mathematician, studied medicine, and was a founding member of the Royal Society. A Royalist, he served as physician to Kings Charles II and James II after the Restoration. It is said that Scarborough's eldest son would drown as an adult in the York River on September 21, 1739, though these dates do not line up and there is no name attached to this legend. Career Scarborough was one of the most prominent of the early English settlers of the Accomac Shire of the Virginia Colony, now the Eastern Shore of Virginia.Wise, pp. 85-86 On April 28, 1651, Scarborough led a raid of some fifty men, on the nearby Pocomoke Indian village along the northern boundary of Accomac Shire, after convincing the settlers that the Indians planned to attack. At least one historian doubts the veracity of his story and suggested that he may have invented the story in order to raise enough men for the attack on the village. After the settlers captured some of the villagers and bound two of them in chains, the Indians massed along the border, and it was believed they were about to attack the English. In May all the men involved in the action were called to appear in court, including Ambrose Dixon, to account for their actions. Scarborough was exonerated, however, when the court found that his raid had been justified by the circumstances.Wise, pp. 117-19 Scarborough at various times served as Speaker of the House of Burgesses,Kukla, pp.40-43 on the Governor's Council, county sheriff, lawyer, planter, surveyor, firearms dealer, cattle rancher, merchant, ship owner, Accomack Justice, and militia colonel. He employed Indians to herd his livestock while at the same time selling guns to them and condemning them in the General Assembly for obtaining firearms. In the 1650s when England was at war with the Dutch, one of Scarborough's ships was seized en route to other colonies for trade. He retaliated by seizing a Prussian ship of similar size, no matter that it was not of Dutch ownership. In 1652, Scarborough sold his seven ships (Deliverance, Mayflower, King David, Sea Horse, Holly Horse, Ann Clear, and Artillery) to William Burton of Boston. He also incited a scandal among a local parson to deflect criticism about his own lack of morals. Near the end of his career, Scarborough helped survey the border between the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the Calvert- Scarborough Line, moving it substantially northwards to keep his own holdings within the colony of Virginia. In 1657, Anthony Johnson‚Äôs white neighbor, Edmund Scarborough, forged a letter in which Johnson acknowledged a debt. Johnson did not contest the case. Johnson was illiterate and could not have written the letter; nevertheless, the court awarded Scarborough 100 acres (40 ha) of Johnson‚Äôs land to pay off his alleged \\"debt\\".Rodriguez, Junius. Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 2. Pg 353: ABC-CLIO. . A familiar tradition on the Eastern Shore holds that he once called local Indians to a great feast where he reported the Great Spirit would speak to them. The Indians dared not disobey, and when they assembled Scarborough fired on them from an artillery piece hidden nearby.Wise p. 87 This most likely took place in Northampton County in 1671. This was Scarborough's way of eliminating enemies and dispersing the local tribes, as well as consolidating his power in the two counties of Accomack and Northampton (which at various times were combined to form one county). By 1663 Col. Scarborough had become an enemy of the Quakers located in Accomack County, Virginia (including Ambrose Dixon). After the group of Quakers moved to Maryland where they were offered more religious freedom, Col. Scarborough used his positions as commander of His Majesty's Forces on Virginia's Eastern Shore and Surveyor-General of the Virginia Colony to lead a force of men into Maryland and claim the area for Virginia. Scarborough's main adversary, Colonel Obedience Robbins (from Northamptonshire, England), served as a foil to \\"King\\" Scarborough during the forty years that he was in power on the Eastern Shore. It is said that the two counties were finally created by the two arch rivals because they did not wish to live in the same municipality; hence, Northampton and Accomack Counties. Robbins also served as a burgess with Scarborough and sought to nullify any attempts by his crafty nemesis to cause trouble on the Eastern Shore, whether it be with local Indians or with local government. Scarborough also took a mistress named Ann Toft (1643‚Äì1687). Ann lived in Accomack from at least 1660 as a femme sole and was probably the wealthiest woman in Accomack due to her association with Scarborough. Ann bore three daughters during the 1660s who were probably fathered by Scarborough. Scarborough set Toft up in business at a plantation known as Gargaphia on present day Gargathy Neck in northern Accomack County (seaside). This of land was transferred from Scarborough to her in Feb. 1664 when Ann was 21. Gargaphia, as it was known, shows up on many maritime maps of the time and would have been a convenient stopping point for sailors and a good embarkation point for Scarborough's many products and crops. Ann married Daniel Jenifer soon after Scarborough's death from smallpox in 1671. Scarborough's main residence was a property in Accomack County on Occahannock Creek known as Hedra Cottage. Although the original house is gone, a later one stands in its place. When Scarborough died after 1671 he was buried there but it is thought that his gravestone was removed by friends to keep his enemies from desecrating his remains. A modern marker has been placed on the grounds.

Life Marion Post was born in New Jersey on June 7, 1910. Her parents split up and she was sent to boarding school, spending time at home with her mother in Greenwich Village when not at school. Here she met many artists and musicians and became interested in dance. She studied at The New School. Post trained as a teacher, and went to work in a small town in Massachusetts. Here she saw the reality of the Depression and the problems of the poor. When the school closed she went to Europe to study with her sister Helen. Helen was studying with Trude Fleischmann, a Viennese photographer. Marion Post showed Fleischmann some of her photographs and was told to stick to photography. Marion Post (Wolcott), Kentucky, February 1940. Marion Post Wolcott with Rolleiflex and Speed Graphic in hand in Montgomery County, Maryland While in Vienna she saw some of the Nazi attacks on the Jewish population and was horrified. Soon she and her sister had to return to America for safety. She went back to teaching but also continued her photography and became involved in the anti-fascist movement. At the New York Photo League she met Ralph Steiner and Paul Strand who encouraged her. When she found that the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin kept sending her to do \\"ladies' stories\\", Ralph Steiner took her portfolio to show Roy Stryker, head of the Farm Security Administration, and Paul Strand wrote a letter of recommendation. Stryker was impressed by her work and hired her immediately. Post's photographs for the FSA often explore the political aspects of poverty and deprivation. They also often find humour in the situations she encountered. In 1941 she met Leon Oliver Wolcott, deputy director of war relations for the U. S. Department of Agriculture under Franklin Roosevelt. They married, and Marion Post Wolcott continued her assignments for the FSA, but resigned shortly thereafter in February 1942. Wolcott found it difficult to fit in her photography around raising a family and a great deal of traveling and living overseas.Deborah L.

In 1978, Wolcott mounted her first solo exhibition in California, and by the 1980s the Smithsonian and the Metropolitan Museum of Art began to collect her photographs. The first monograph on Marion Post Wolcott's work was published in 1983. Wolcott was an advocate for women's rights; in 1986, Wolcott said: \\"Women have come a long way, but not far enough. . . .

He was a Marxist rebel in his youth and later became the Editor of the controversial Sinhalese newspaper Ravaya. He served as the Editor of the Ravaya for 25 years consecutively since its inception. Victor is an investigative journalist, political critic, a theorist, social activist and also an author of several books. He was the 7th accused of the main court case on the Youth Insurrection 1971. The panel of judges described him as the most colourful character of all suspects respondents. Judgment of the Criminal Justice Commission. Inquiry No, 1 ‚Äì Government Printer- page 255. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment at the end of the inquiry. During his imprisonment he abandoned the doctrine of the JVP as well as that of Marxism. While rejecting the doctrine of violence he became an ardent follower of Mahatma Gandhi adopting the philosophy of non- violence expounded by him. Early life Born on 26 June 1949, Ivan was educated at St. Anthony's College, Kandy.Victor Ivan Majuwana Kankanamge v. Sri Lanka, Communication No. 909/2000, Insurrection He was a leader of the 1971 insurrection of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and used the nomme- de-guerre Podi Athula (as opposed to \\"Loku Athula\\" the former minister Athula Nimalasiri Jayasinghe). He was unable to take part in the insurrection has he was badly wounded months before while making bombs for it and had undergo surgery at a private hospital in Colombo. The leaders prosecuting the 1971 April insurrection trail began on 12 June 1972, at the Queen's Club, located at the Baudddhaloka Mawatha, before the Criminal Justice Commission composed of Chief Justice H N G Fernando (Chairman) Justice A C A Alles, Justice V T Thamotheram, Justice H Dheragoda and Justice T W Rajaratnam. Those pleading not guilty were brought in batches before the Commission. The main case consisted of 41 suspects which included Mr Ivan. They were considered to be the main architects of the uprising and the youth rebellion. Ivan and several other rebellions were found guilty and were punished with imprisonments.Alles AC Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna 1969‚Äì1989 In 1977 he was released with others on an un-conditional pardon given by Jayawardena Government. Later he joined LSSP and unsuccessfully contested the Galle by-election.Banduthillka Malalgoda Sri Lankawe Methiwarana Ithihasaya He now recalls that the insurrection was a \\"foolish dream\\" When in prison, Victor Ivan wrote two books. One: on the feudal character of taxation on nde system cultivation in Sri Lanka and its adverse impact on Productivity. The other was on the History of JVP and 1971 Insurrection. In that he claims that the prevailing discriminatory caste system in the Sri Lankan society had been an important contributory factor in the 1971 insurrection. Later, he wrote another book titled \\"Social background of Youth Rebels of Sri Lanka\\" in which he argues that the caste system, apart from being a major factor in the youth insurrections in the Sinhala South, has equally become a crucial factor in the youth insurrections triggered by the Tamil youths in the North as well. This is a new dimension that Victor Ivan has added to the intellectual stock of reflective analyses of the social issues of Sri Lanka. Until then the society in general, and even the social scientists, considered caste a taboo and an issue not to be discussed openly. The insights that he made persistently on this subject has eventually resulted in the social scientists in Sri Lanka too, sharing his view and admitting that the caste constitutes an important factor affecting the social crisis the country is faced today. The report submitted by the Presidential Commission appointed in 1990, pursuant to the suppression of the second JVP insurrection in 1989, to investigate into the factors that had caused the youth insurrections admitted that the caste system had played a crucial role in the Sinhala and Tamil youth uprisings. Ivan in his book \\"Pansale Viplawaya\\" published in Sinhala in 2009, which has been translated into English titled \\"Revolt in the Temple-The Buddhist Revival up to Gangodawila Some Thera ‚Äì\\" has made an in-depth analysis of this proposition explaining the impact of caste discrimination on Buddhist political trends that emerge intermittently in Sri Lanka. In another book written by him on \\"Caste, Family & Politics\\" Ivan makes a deep analysis on how the caste system has impacted on politics of Sri Lanka since of independence to date. Journalism Victor Ivan entered the field of journalism in 1986, at a time when the country was in turmoil with the outbreak of violent youth insurrections triggered by the Sinhalese in the South and the Tamils in the North. \\"The Ravaya\\", the monthly magazine that he launched soon became popular among the readers and turned out to be the magazine of highest demand at that time. Revelation of the presence of radio- active substances in the products of \\"Nestle\\" company in the aftermath of the Chernobille Disaster was one of the most remarkable article published by Ravaya magazine. The Ravaya magazine maintained a critical and analytically approach. It had an average monthly sale of 40,000 copies. With the surge of JVP insurrection, almost all media organisations cautiously refrained from reporting things which were not in favour of the JVP as well as the security forces that were fighting against the JVP. Thus, when all other media agencies remained silent, the Ravaya adopted a bold policy of expressing its views openly. It followed a policy of criticising the excesses committed by both parties ‚Äì the JVP and the security forces. During this period, a large number of media people were assassinated by the JVP and the security forces alike on account of their taking sides of either of the two parties. Those who were sympathetic to the JVP came under severe wrath of the security forces and vice versa. The rebels proscribed the 1988 presidential election declaring it is illegal and demanding the voters to boycott it. The JVP adopted a policy of assassinating those who defied their orders. Victor Ivan, through the Ravaya magazine appealed to the people to ignore the orders of the rebels and exercise their right to vote. The strategy of the JVP was to prevent the unlikely change of the government and create a favourable atmosphere for the candidate of the governing party to win the election and obtain the support of the defeated opposition parties in their pursuit of propelling the youth uprising into a successful end. But Victor Ivan openly declared that if the JVP prevents the government change by force, it will undoubtedly result in the wholesale extermination of the rebels themselves by the government. It so happened that the ruling party won the election and eventually the JVP was crushed. Magazine converted to a newspaper After the defeat of the JVP by the security forces, Victor Ivan upgraded the Ravaya magazine into a tabloid size weekly newspaper. Since then its scope was widened. The Ravaya no longer remained a publication confined to the critics only. It expanded its perspective becoming a newspaper committed to exposing the corruptions and wrongdoings taking place in the country. The average sale of the Ravaya newspaper increased to the level of 80,000 copies per week .It became a visionary guide and the force that inspired the opposition political parties and political movements which had become frail and weak at that time. The Ravaya led the political campaign that brought Chandrika Kumaratunga back to the political scene and ultimately raised her in to power. But Victor Ivan declined to accept any position offered to him by Chandrika after she was elected the President of the country. Later, he became a vehement critic of the rule of Chandrika. The disputes that arose consequent thereof, created an atmosphere where Victor Ivan had to come under death threats from the rule of Chandrika. Upon her retirement, President Chandrika Kumaranatunga, got the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to vest a valuable piece of state owned land in her name. Victor Ivan filed a case against her on this corrupt transaction (C.A. (Writ) No. 2074/2005). The court ruled out that the land in dispute be revested in the state. Victor Ivan wrote a book titled \\"Chaurya Rajina\\" in sinhala about Chandrika Kumaranatunga and the period of her rule. The English translation of it was published under the title \\"The Queen of Deceit\\". The book created an enviable sales record in Sri Lanka. More than 50,000 copies of it were sold in a very short time.

This initiative created the appropriate background for abolishing of both these laws. He challenged the legality of the Parliamentary Privileges Act in regard to a case filed against him under the provisions of the said act. There were three other similar cases filed against him under the same Act at that time. He boldly challenged the legitimacy of the law itself and argued successfully that though, the parliament is entitled to safeguard its privileges, the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry has no right to sit on judgment against people and punish them without having a proper trial procedure approved by law which is an essential prerequisite for instituting legal action and imposing punishments. In view of the wide publicity given for this fundamental objection that he raised against the law itself and the pressure exerted by the opposition parties and the international organisations, the parliament was compelled to abolish the parliamentary privileges law and stop the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry sitting on cases against media people and imposing punishments on them. His next legal battle was against the Criminal Defamation Law which was in operation against the media people. There were 11 cases filed against him under this law. Perhaps, he may be the only journalist in the world against whom such a large number of cases had been filed under the Criminal Defamation Law. According to his interpretation the use of the Criminal Defamation Law against the media people is suggestive of the Attorney General exercising his discretion against people on political grounds which is contrary to the rule of law. In the circumstance, Victor Ivan filed a fundamental rights case against the Attorney General challenging the validity of the practice adopted by him in filing court cases against him (victor) under the Criminal Defamation Law. He made the Attorney General a respondent both on official as well as on personal level. Ivan lost the case and he made an appeal to the committee for Human Rights in Geneva under U.N. Convenat on Civil and Political Rights against the verdict of the Supreme Court. The Human Rights Committee in Geneva conducted an inquiry on his appeal (by that time the government had already abolished the Law of Criminal Defamation and had been informed to the Human Rights Committee) and reached the verdict the fundamental rights of Victor Ivan had been violated and ordered to pay compensation for the damage caused to him. (CCRP/C/81/D/909/2000 August 2004) In the name of the Independence of the judiciary Of all the struggles made by Victor Ivan, the one he launched against Sarathnanda Silva, the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka (1999‚Äì 2009) which he aimed at safeguarding the independence of the judiciary is reckoned to be the most outstanding and daring struggle. The Ravaya once exposed a Magistrate who had been accused of raping a female respondent of a court case heard by him. Sarathnanda Silva, the Attorney General, adamantly maintained a rigid stand of safeguarding the accused when the Criminal Investigations Department had confirmed after investigations that the accused magistrate had actually committed the offence. Under the circumstance, Victor Ivan, began to delve into the character of the Attorney General himself on the presumption that he too, might be a corrupt person as much as the accused he was safeguarding. He was able to discover a good incident that revealed the corrupt nature of his character. When Sarath Nanda Silva was the head of the Court of Appeal, which was prior to his being appointed to the post of Attorney General, his legal wife had left him but not legally separated from him. During this time Sarath Nanda Silva lived with a mistress in his own house who happened to be the wife of a close friend of him. The husband of his mistress, a chemical engineer filed a case against his wife and Sarath Nanda Silva making both of them respondents seeking court approval to dissolve his marriage on account of the immoral behaviour of his wife with Sarath Nanda Silva . It came to light that the District Judge who heard this case had acted in favour of the Attorney General and in a manner which is oppressive to the chemical engineer and was contrary to the rule of law. The case record and the verdict of the judge amply manifested that the District Judge had been biased and acted as a puppet of the Attorney General. Ivan exposed the true facts of this case accusing the magistrate and the Attorney General. At the same time he continued to voice against this rapist magistrate, the district Judge who chaired the case against Sarath Nanda Silva and Attorney general which ultimately resulted in the Chief Justice being compelled to appoint 2 tri partite committees to investigate into the allegations made against the magistrate and the district judge. The 2 committees found both of them guilty of the charges levelled against them by Victor Ivan. Apart from this, he filed a case in the Supreme Court against the Attorney General seeking his expulsion from the legal profession on the grounds of his corrupt behaviour. On the basis of his complaint, the Supreme Court initiated an investigation against the Attorney General. While the investigation was in progress, the incumbent Chief Justice went on retirement. Surprisingly, the President appointed Sarath Nanda Silva who had faced corruption charges as the New Chief justice. DatoParam Kumaraswamy of the UNO openly condemned this appointment.https://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/corruption/judicial_group/Third_Judicial_Group_report.pdf Sarath Nanda Silva was a close confidant of the President. The independent stand of the judiciary was not to her liking. She wanted to save her friend from the unfortunate mess he had fallen into and also to find a person like Sarath Nanda Silva whom she could manipulate in wielding her power over the judiciary. Ivan making a vehement protest against this inapt appointment published the Ravaya newspaper as a Black Issue with a picture depicting the new Chief Justice taking the oath before the President overturned in black background. Thereafter, he submitted a fundamental rights petition challenging the appointment of the new Chief Justice. The International Bar association and the Law Commission of India making a joint representation sent V.S. Malimath, a retired Chief justice from Kerala to Sri Lanka to observe the proceedings of this historic trial‚Äô. The International Bar Association, in a report published in November 2001 on caption 'Sri Lanka: Failing to Protect the Rule of Law and the Independence of the Judiciary‚Äô has given a comprehensive account of the illegal manner and ludicrous nature in which this inquiry was held. Victor Ivan, throughout the tenure of the new chief justice vehemently and persistently criticised all illegal actions and injustices that he committed in the arena of judiciary. Based on a comprehensive study of the telephone correspondences over a period of three months he was able to prove that the chief justice has had connections with the underworld. Based on the resultant crisis situation in the judiciary following the appointment of Sarath Nanda Silva as the chief justice, Victor Ivan published a book titled ‚ÄòUnfinished Struggle-For the Independence of the Judiciary‚Äô while Sarath Nanda Silva was holding the post of Chief justice . Addressing the Second Global Conference of the Investigative Journalists held in Copenhagen from 2‚Äì4 May 2003, which he attended on invitation, Victor Ivan shared his experience of investigative journalism that he practised in regard to the judiciary of Sri Lanka and the legal battle he had to pursue in the process. Perception on media He has an acidic criticism about the media culture in Sri Lanka and some acknowledged theoretical aspects of media as well. His experience and views on the subject are amply expressed in the book titled ‚ÄòInnocence of the Pen Questioned' that he published in 2009. He criticised others and similarly let others criticise him. Perhaps, the Ravaya may be the only newspaper which has allowed others to criticise the editor of it in the same newspaper. This can be reckoned to be a new tradition added to the media culture. Philosophy Ivan admires Bertrand Russell, so his son is named Athula Russell. Russell was a six-time Sri Lanka chess champion from 2003 to 2010.

Biography  The son of Sam Pollard, Ernest C. Pollard lived until age 10 in China, moving to the United Kingdom when his father died. He studied physics at Cambridge University. He did his PhD work under James Chadwick at Cavendish Laboratory, which was led by Ernest Rutherford, receiving his degree in 1932. In 1933, he joined the physics department of Yale University, where he designed the university's first cyclotron in 1939. He co-wrote the first \\"textbook\\" in the subject: Applied Nuclear Physics with William L. Davidson, Jr. then Research Physicist of the B.F. Goodrich Company, published in 1942. From 1941 to 1945 he was a member of the MIT Radiation Laboratory, working on such projects as Li'l Abner (for which he was granted a patent), MEW, the moving target indicator, and the height finder; and serving as associate head, co-head, and head of Division 10. For his work on radar development, he received the President's Certificate of Merit from President of the United States Harry S. Truman. In 1948 he led the formation of a group of biophysicists at Yale. A department of biophysics was formally organized there in 1954, with funding from the John A. Hartford Foundation, where he became a professor, serving as the departmental chairman until 1961. During this time, Pollard supervised numerous doctoral students including the future Crafoord Prize winner Carl Woese. (The department of biophysics subsequently merged with the department of biochemistry, in 1969, becoming the department of molecular biophysics and biochemistry.) As part of the centennial celebration at Vassar College, he spoke on The Advance of Physical Science into the Biological and Social Sciences at a conference on the natural and social sciences on 1960-11-04. He was also a member of the national Democratic advisory committee on science and technology during John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign. During the 1950s, he was head of the Committee on Loyalty and Security, an arm of the Federation of American Scientists, a group that actively defended scientists that were attacked during the McCarthy hearings. Pollard founded the Biophysical Society in 1957, serving as a member of its executive board in that year and also as its president later from 1959‚Äì1960. From 1961 until his retirement in 1971 Pollard taught at Pennsylvania State University, founding the Department of Biophysics there. The Ernest C. Pollard Lectures, given at the university as part of a programme of lectures by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, are named after him, as is the Ernest C. Pollard Professorship in Biotechnology. At the same time he served on the NASA Advisory Committee on Space Biology alongside Carl Sagan. After retirement, he continued as a research scholar, initially at Pennsylvania State University until 1977 and thereafter at the University of Florida and Duke University, as well as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina.

It was founded in 1966 and granted royal patronage in 2002. History Alan Beddoe, founding president of the society The society was established in October 1966, as the Heraldry Society of Canada, by a group of heraldic enthusiasts from Ottawa under the leadership of Alan Beddoe. The organizing meeting occurred at Ottawa's Beacon Arms Hotel. In 2002, royal patronage was extended to the society, and its name changed to the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada. The designation was officially proclaimed at the society's annual meeting in Victoria, British Columbia on October 22 of that year by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, Iona Campagnolo. The arms of the society were accordingly augmented in December 2002 with the addition of the Royal Crown to the supporters. The society is notable for being one of the few organizations in Canada to make use of a ceremonial mace. The society's mace is fashioned from pewter and wood, and inscribed with heraldic symbols. Activities The society has six regional branches, which sponsor periodic talks and lectures on the topic of heraldry: British Columbia / Yukon, Laurentian (Montreal), Ottawa Valley, Prairie, Toronto, and Vancouver. It publishes a biannual journal, Heraldry in Canada, a quarterly newsletter, Gonfanon, and has published the reference books Canadian Heraldry (1981) and A Canadian Heraldic Primer (2001). The society has underwritten the cost of displaying the arms of the Governors General of Canada at Ottawa's Church of St. Bartholomew, sponsored the diamond jubilee display of the Queen's Beasts at the Canadian Museum of History, financed the design and acquisition of the tabard of the Chief Herald of Canada, assisted in the restoration of the heraldic installations at Hart House at the University of Toronto, and actively liaisons with provincial and municipal governments for \\"the protection and proper use of heraldry\\". =Distinctions= The society grants three distinctions, each carrying post- nominal letters: Fellow of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada (FRHSC), Honorary Fellow of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada (FRHSC, Hon.), and Licentiate of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada (LRHSC). Notable persons having been granted society distinctions include Bruce W. Beatty, Graham Anderson, D'Arcy Boulton, Bruce Patterson, Conrad Swan, Robert Watt, Auguste Vachon, Christopher McCreery, John Matheson, Darrel Kennedy, Claire Boudreau, and Cathy Bursey-Sabourin.

This high-precision instrument is subject to harsh winter conditions from the snowbelt downwind of Lake Erie. It is generally considered to be an outdoor symphonic organ. The instrument was installed in 1907 and given to the Chautauqua Institution by Eliza A. Massey in memory of her husband, Hart Massey. During the Chautauqua summer season, which runs from late June to late August, there were recitals on the Massey Organ most Wednesdays by organist Jared Jacobsen, until his death in August 2019, just after the season ended. There are also tours of the organ and \\"Children's Encounter\\" programs on alternating Sunday evenings. In 1914, 1928 and 1972, the Massey Organ received tonal changes and replacement or reconfiguring of some of the pipes. In 1992‚Äì1993, a complete reconstruction was completed by the Fischer Pipe Organ Company of Erie, Pennsylvania. All the existing pipes were restored to their original stop designations, some were replaced and new windchests added. As of 2016, the instrument has 5,640 pipes. A video documentary showing the instrument's 1992‚Äì1993 reconstruction was made by Rochester Institute of Technology student Frederick Rueckert. This DVD is currently available for purchase at the Chautauqua Institution bookstore, under the title \\"Between the Motion and the Music, the Massey Organ Reconstruction\\". In 2003, a 32' Bombarde stop was added to the instrument by Fischer Pipe Organ Company. This unique stop, built by AR Shopp and Company, was donated by Rueckert in memory of his grandparents and his college documentary project. In September 2016, the Chautauqua Amphitheater, which was listed on the national register of historic places, and housed the instrument was demolished to make way for a new and updated building. The new Amphitheater has integrated the existing Massey Memorial Organ and its brick organ vault, leaving the organ fa√ßade exposed as before and the vault now encased within the new Amphitheater back of house structure. During the winter months giant garage doors cover the instruments fa√ßade (front) pipes, protecting the instrument from the elements. This instrument is considered an outdoor instrument, where the air temperature of the outside is the same as inside the organ, this a challenge to keep the instrument in tune. With Jacobsen's death in a car accident on August 27, 2019, the organ has been taken out of use until a replacement organist has been hired.

She was named after Mount Shasta, a volcano in the Cascade Range in northern California. Shastas mission was to support forward deployed aircraft carrier battle groups, which she accomplished through underway replenishment (known as \\"unrep\\") and vertical replenishment (known as \\"vertrep\\"). Over three decades, Shasta and her crew took part in the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm, and numerous other actions. To accomplish her underway replenishment mission, Shasta utilized seven underway replenishment stations utilizing the Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM), and utilized four cargo booms to load and unload cargo. To accomplish her vertical replenishment mission, Shasta embarked two CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters together with their air and maintenance crews; Shastas ship's company ran the flight deck and tower. Shastas Deck Department was among the best in the United States Pacific Fleet.  Construction and commissioning  Shastas keel was laid down 10 November 1969 at the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, sponsored by Mrs. Ralph W. Cousins, wife of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. She was launched on 3 April 1971. Upon completion, the builder took her to Charleston, South Carolina and delivered her to the Navy. Shasta was commissioned in Charleston on 4 February 1972, with Captain Warren C. Graham, Jr., in command. Shasta was a combat logistics ship whose primary missions were underway replenishment (\\"UNREP\\"), where it passed cargo and supplies to other warships steaming alongside close aboard, and vertical replenishment (\\"VERTREP\\"), where helicopters would transfer cargo to nearby ships. The main supplies transferred by Shasta was ammunition (bombs, missiles, etc.), but she also transferred significant quantities of fuel oil (Diesel Fuel Marine, or DFM, also known as NATO F76), spare parts, food, dry goods and personnel. Shastas initial armament included four twin 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounts and multiple .50 caliber machine gun positions. One of Shastas innovations was a covered main deck, which allowed for protected cargo handling operations, and fork truck use from the flight deck to the forward cargo holds and unrep stations. For a ship of its large size, Shasta had an interesting engineering design. It had three 600 psi steam boilers and only one propeller, and a prominent bulbous bow.  1970s ‚Äì entering service and Vietnam  After fitting out, the newly commissioned Shasta departed Charleston on 22 May 1972 for her shakedown cruise and training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After completing shakedown and training on 10 June, she headed for the Pacific, where her new homeport was to be the Naval Weapons Station in Concord, California. Along the way, she made port visits to Kingston, Jamaica; Cartagena, Colombia; Panama City, Canal Zone; and Acapulco, Mexico. She passed through the Panama Canal and finally arrived in Concord on 3 July. After arrival in Concord, she underwent ship's qualification trials and final contract trials. Upon completion of trials and preparations for deployment, Shasta departed Concord to join the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific (WestPac in US Navy terminology) on 3 January 1973 in support of operations off Vietnam during the Vietnam War, returning to Concord in July 1973. Shasta made additional WestPac deployments: * July‚ÄìDecember 1974 * April‚ÄìNovember 1977 * September 1978 ‚Äì April 1979 * September 1979 ‚Äì June 1980, with HC-11 Detachment 7 embarked with two CH-46 helicopters During the 1979‚Äì1980 deployment, Shasta deployed as part of a task force in the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea off the coast of Iran during the Iranian hostage crisis, for which it received the Navy Expeditionary Medal.  1980s ‚Äì Western Pacific and the Middle East  = Armament = Shastas armament was upgraded during the Cold War to include chaff and two Vulcan Phalanx CIWS 20MM Gatling gun close- in weapon systems for missile defense and AN/SLQ-25 Nixie for anti-torpedo defense. During the 1980s Shasta conducted many Cold War operations, and many operations related to United States interests in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. = Deployments during the early 1980s = Shasta made the following deployments during the early 1980s: * September 1981 ‚Äì April 1982: Western Pacific & Indian Ocean/North Arabian Sea with HC-11 Detachment 7 embarked with two CH-46D helicopters. During this deployment, Shasta rescued 298 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees in the South China Sea, for which Shasta's crew received the Humanitarian Service Medal. * September 1982 ‚Äì April 1983: Western Pacific & Indian Ocean/North Arabian Sea. Port Calls included: Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong, Korea and Thailand. Also, extended operations in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf.

Kaye to support United States interests in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Shasta deployed as part of the battle group. Shasta supported the Ranger battle group in the North Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman off the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz. The ship and her crew made port calls at Mombasa, Kenya, Subic Bay Naval Base, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and conducted airhead operations at al-Masirah, Oman. The crew earned the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon for its service on the deployment. = Carl Vinson download = In February 1986, Shasta conducted download operations with the battle group in the Gulf of Alaska. Shasta conducted these operations during a major winter storm in the Gulf of Alaska. = 1987 deployment to Western Pacific and Middle East = Shasta deployed to the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans in 1987, including three months in the North Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in support of Operation Earnest Will, with Battle Group Echo, formed around the , and the surface action group under the command of Joint Task Force Middle East (now United States Naval Forces Central Command).For further reading on Operation Earnest Will, see: This included three months on station off the coast of Iran and the Hormuz Strait with the Task Force in Gonzo Station. Other ships in this combined task force included , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Shasta with Battle Group Echo off the coast of Iran, October 1987 During the deployment Shasta conducted many airhead operations at al-Masirah, Oman. During its time on station, Shasta sortied to rearm destroyers in support of Operation Nimble Archer. Also during this deployment, Shasta made port visits at Lualualei in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Subic Bay, Luzon, Philippines (two); Singapore; Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territories; Pattaya, Thailand; and Hong Kong. Shasta was also involved in Cold War operations during the deployment, and had frequent contact with Soviet vessels and aircraft. Shasta transited the Northern, Eastern and Western Pacific Ocean the San Bernardino Strait; the South China Sea; the Straits of Malacca; the Bay of Bengal; the Singapore Strait; the northern and southern Indian Ocean; the Gulf of Thailand; the Philippine Sea; the North Arabian Sea; the Gulf of Oman; and into the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz. Shastas crew was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon for their service on this deployment. During the deployment, en route from Thailand to Hong Kong, Shasta sailed through a super typhoon in the South China Sea, sustaining damage, but never reducing her operational capacity. During this deployment, Shasta steamed 44,633 nautical miles, and at one point spent 79 consecutive days at sea on station off the coast of Iran, most at condition III (wartime steaming). Shasta crossed the Equator in the Indian Ocean en route to Diego Garcia and held a line-crossing ceremony and initiated the shellbacks into the solemn mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep. Prior to transit east through the Straits of Malacca and back into the Pacific Ocean, Shasta turned over her duties in the Middle East to her sister ship, the . = Drug interdiction operations = In 1988, Shasta supported drug smuggling interdiction operations off Baja California, and conducted a \\"show the flag\\" port visit in Mazatl√°n, Mexico. = 1989 deployment to Bering Sea and Western Pacific = Shasta's flight deck crew attaching a cargo pendant to the bottom of an CH-46 during vertrep operations on deployment. In 1989, under the command of Commander Daniel A. Gabe, Shasta deployed independently to the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and Bering Sea during PACEX 89 as a show of force against the Soviet Union. While operating independently during PACEX, Shasta conducted operations in conjunction with several aircraft carrier and battleship task forces, including operations with the . Thereafter, Shasta deployed independently to the Western Pacific, South China Sea, East China Sea and Philippine Sea for logistics operations in Eastern Asia, all for Cold War operations. During this deployment, Shasta conducted airhead operations at Cold Bay, Alaska and King Cove, Alaska (both on the Alaskan Peninsula), and Amchitka, Alaska (in the Rat Islands of the Aleutian Chain). Shasta transited the San Bernardino Strait, Amchitka Pass, Unimak Pass, and the Andreanof Islands. Shasta made port calls at Guam; Subic Bay, Luzon, Philippines; Hong Kong; Okinawa; Sasebo, Japan; Yokosuka, Japan; and Pearl Harbor. When Shasta arrived in Hong Kong, the crew learned that the Berlin Wall had fallen, one of the final episodes of the Cold War. Shasta maneuvered through a major winter storm during its transit of the Bering Sea, and engaged in typhoon evasion in the Philippine Sea, San Bernardino Strait and South China Sea; Luzon sustained significant damage from the typhoon. Shastas crew received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon for their service on this deployment. While Shasta was deployed, its home port, the San Francisco Bay Area was hit by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which affected the families of many crew members. The face of the city to which the crew returned had changed considerably. The deployment was notable for many reasons, but most prominently, Shasta embarked three remarkable female officers as part of ship's company: Ops Boss (Operations Officer and Operations Department Head) Lieutenant Pam Markiewicz, who later commanded and ; Supply Department Head (SUPPO or Supply Officer) Lieutenant Marion Eggenberger, who rose to the rank of Captain in the Navy Supply Corps; and A Gang Division Officer Kristi Sidebottom. They were prominent reasons for the success of Shastas deployment. = Shipyards = Shasta underwent major overhauls on the San Francisco waterfront in 1986 and 1988, including several months in dry dock in 1988. = Homeport = Shastas home port was Concord Naval Weapons Station, on the Suisun Bay in the Sacramento River. However, Shasta spent much of its inport time at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on the Napa River in Vallejo, California; Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California on the South San Francisco Bay; and Naval Supply Center, Oakland and Oakland Army Base, both in Oakland, California also on the South San Francisco Bay. Shasta also spent several months every two years at various shipyards on the south San Francisco waterfront. This situation of going to sea from one port and returning to another led to many logistical difficulties for the ship's crew. = Blessing of the Fleet and community involvement = Shasta had a special relationship with the Benicia Yacht Club, in Benicia, California, and participated in many of its Blessing of the Fleet ceremonies in the Carquinez Strait of the Sacramento River, leading to many memorable festivities. Shasta also participated in Fleet Week in San Francisco Bay. Shasta's crew participated in community events in Shasta, California, her namesake city and near her namesake Mount Shasta, and extinct volcano in Northern California, including Shasta's honor guard marching in holiday parades. Shasta trained midshipmen from NROTC and the United States Naval Academy. Shasta also hosted \\"tiger cruises\\" for family members and Navy veterans through the Navy League.  1990s ‚Äì Desert Storm and transfer to MSC  = Shipyards = In early 1990, Shasta underwent a major shipyard overhaul on the San Francisco waterfront, and conducted sea trials in May 1990.

Aziz (April 15, 1923 ‚Äì September 13, 2009) was a Canadian artist. He lived in London, Ontario, and was of Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christian descent. He was recognized for his work in the technique of egg tempera-en-gesso panel, a method popular during the Renaissance. Early years Aziz was born in St. Thomas, Ontario, before moving to London, Ontario, at an early age. He grew up in old South London and attended H.B. Beal Secondary School, enrolling in its arts program. Aziz graduated from Yale University with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1949. He next travelled the world, living alternately in New York City and London, Ontario, where he resided in his now heritage-designated home, also the site of his studio and art gallery. From 1947 to 1949 Aziz was an art instructor at Yale University and a lecturer at various colleges and museums throughout Canada and the United States. From 1950 to 1955, Aziz lectured at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), teaching art and art history as well as helping to expand the collection at UWO's McIntosh Gallery. He was UWO's first official artist in residence in 1953. In 1972 and 1976, Aziz was the artist in residence and lecturer at the Aspen Institute Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Aspen, Colorado. Aziz painted commissioned portraits of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Premier the Honorable John Robarts, Governor-General Georges Vanier and Mrs. Vanier, noted Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh, and mezzo- soprano opera star Rise Stevens. In the late 1950s Aziz was commissioned by John Christopher Cody, London's seventh Catholic bishop, to transform the former Sacred Heart Chapel in London's St. Peter's Cathedral Basilica, London‚Äôs. Peter's Basilica into Christ the King Chapel and design the interior of the Lady Chapel. Later years In the early 1970s Aziz successfully fought for the retention and refurbishment of the historic old Court House and Gaol at the Forks of the Thames River in London, Ontario, and developed a plan for the redevelopment of the river forks, which attracted support and attention from Premier John Robarts, the then London South MP John White, author Pierre Berton, and TV and radio station owner, and newspaper publisher Walter J. Blackburn. Aziz's redevelopment plan lost by one vote at London City Council, but many of his ideas were implemented in 2005‚Äì2006, with the completion of the multi-staged, multimillion-dollar 'Forks-of-the-Thames Project'. Aziz established the Philip Aziz Foundation of Art, a non-profit charity in London, to expand his gallery, built in 1967 as his Canadian Centennial project. =2000s= On June 2, 2006, at Museum London, Aziz unveiled his egg tempera-en-gesso painting Follow Me, a tribute to the late Pope John Paul II. The unveiling occurred during an Alumni Western event, a gala attended by several hundred University of Western Ontario alumni, and members of the local media. On September 11, 2006, in council chambers at city hall and on behalf of the City of London, Aziz presented Academy Award-winning screenwriter and filmmaker Paul Haggis with his painting Celestial City, completed in 1974. The day had been named Paul Haggis Day, and the city announced that a future park in southwest London would be named in Haggis's honour. On October 21, 2006, during the Islamic Centre of Southwestern Ontario's annual feast following the holy month of Ramadan, Aziz unveiled his egg tempera-on-gesso-panel and 24-carat gold leaf work titled the Tree of Lebanon, completed as a humanitarian fundraiser for relief efforts in Lebanon. The painting is mounted on a five by three foot panel of Lebanese cedar. Five hundred full-size colour prints signed by Aziz were sold for $1,000 each. The painting was to be displayed at the UN headquarters in New York City, after which it was to hang in the presidential palace in Lebanon. On November 29, 2006, London International Airport unveiled Aziz's twelve by seven foot egg tempera painting Epilogue, completed in 1976. Aziz had agreed to loan the painting to the airport for three years. Death Philip Aziz died on September 13, 2009, after a 10-year battle with cancer.Kathy Rumelski, Artist lauded for scope of work The London Free Press. Retrieved on September 16, 2009. Awards and honours In 1968 Aziz was invited to the Republican and Democratic national conventions. He took a side trip to Texas, where then- Governor John Smith made him an honorary admiral in the Texas Navy.

The M3 holds a maximum of seven rounds and uses the proprietary Benelli semi-automatic system first showcased in the M1. The M3 is notable for allowing the user the choice of semi-automatic or pump-action operation. It is reliable and versatile, and popular with military and police forces as well as civilians. Background Pump-action operation is employed when shooting less powerful shells, such as rubber bullets, that do not generate enough recoil to operate the semi-automatic mechanism. Conversely, the semi-automatic mode can be employed with more powerful shells, absorbing some of the recoil. Switching between the two modes is done by manipulating the ring located at the front of the forend grip. The Benelli M3 also features a removable stock allowing the user to choose one of two styles, the traditional shotgun stock or a stock with a pistol grip. The Benelli M3 is an updated version of the Benelli M1 shotgun. The M3 uses the same inertia recoil semi-automatic system as the earlier Benelli M1, but adds another Benelli-patented feature, which allows the shooter to lock the semi-automatic action and switch to the manually operated pump-action mode and back in the matter of seconds. The action type switch is located at the forward end of the forearm, and is formed as an annular knurled ring. Rotation of this ring either engages the action rods of the pump system and locks the semi-automatic recoil system, or disengages the action bars, locks the forearm and allows the inertia recoil system to operate the action automatically. This greatly improves the versatility of the shotgun, allowing it to fire low-powered ammunition (mostly of special purpose, such as less-lethal rubber or tear-gas projectiles) in the manually operated pump action mode, and to fire full power combat loads with slugs or buckshot in rapid semi-automatic mode. An underbarrel tubular magazine usually holds 8 rounds for police or military versions, or less in some civilian models. The M3 Super 90 is available with various barrel lengths and stock options, with fixed butt and semi-pistol or pistol grips, or with top-folding butts and pistol grips. Sight options include shotgun-type open sights, rifle type open sights, ghost ring (diopter) sights and various mounts for reflex or low magnification telescope sights and tactical flashlights and laser pointers. Variants The Benelli M3 comes in several variations, most notably the M3 Super 90, which features a smaller body. There is also a shorter version, which is easier to transport, used by law enforcement officers. While other Benelli self-loading shotguns have the recoil spring inside a tube in butt-stock, in the M3 the recoil spring is placed around the magazine tube. This is an interesting feature for weapon modification, since other shotguns (such as M1, M2 and M4) attach the butt-stock to the recoil spring tube. The M3 has a dummy tube just for stock attachment. Benelli's M3T is an OEM variant, where the butt-stock and dummy tube have been replaced with a pistol grip and up-folding skeleton butt-stock. Benelli's SuperNova pump- shotgun and MR1 self-loading rifle have similar butt-stock attachment to the M3, so this adds two new butt-stock options to M3. The M3 butt-stock and dummy rod can be replaced with a \\"Benelli SuperNova Tactical Collapsible Stock\\". The collapsible stock allows 5-position draw length adjustment, so a shooter can compensate the effects of thick winter clothes or body armor by adjusting the stock length. The required spare parts are: Adjustment rod, pistol grip and collapsible butt-stock. A rare modification is to replace the M3 butt-stock and dummy rod with a \\"Benelli SuperNova Handle Grip\\". The \\"handle grip\\" is just the pistol grip attached to the receiver with a screw.

Founded in 1987 in Oregon by former employees of Intel, the company went public in 1995. The company's products are used in mobile network applications such as small cell radio access networks, wireless core network elements, deep packet inspection and policy management equipment; conferencing, and media services including voice, video and data. In 2015, Radisys first-quarter revenues totaled $48.7 million, and employed 700 people. Arun Bhikshesvaran is the company's chief executive officer. On 30 June 2018, Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries acquired Radisys for $74 million. History Radisys was founded in 1987 as Radix Microsystems in Beaverton, Oregon, by former Intel engineers Dave Budde and Glen Myers. The first investors were employees who put up $50,000 each, with Tektronix later investing additional funds into the company. Originally located in space leased from Sequent Computer Systems, by 1994 the company had grown to annual sales of $20 million. The company's products were computers used in end products such as automated teller machines to paint mixers. On October 20, 1995, the company became a publicly traded company when it held an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO raised $19.6 million for Radisys after selling 2.7 million shares at $12 per share. In 1996, the company moved its headquarters to a new campus in Hillsboro, and at that time sales reached $80 million and the company had a profit of $9.6 million that year with 175 employees. Company co-founder Dave Budde left the company in 1997, with company revenues at $81 million annually at that time. The company grew in part by acquisitions such as Sonitech International in 1997, part of IBM's Open Computing Platform unit and Texas Micro in 1999, all of S-Link in 2001, and Microware also in 2001. Radisys also moved some production to China in order to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs. In 2002, the company had grown to annual revenues of $200 million, and posted a profit in the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters. That year Scott Grout was named as chief executive officer of the company and C. Scott Gibson became the chairman of the board, both replacing Glen Myers who co-founded the company. The company sold off its signaling gateway line in 2003. They raised $97 million through selling convertible senior notes in November 2003. In 2004, the company stopped granting stock options to employees and transitioned to giving restricted shares for some compensation. Radisys grew to annual revenues of $320 million by 2005. The company continued to grow through acquisitions such as a $105 million deal that added Convedia Corp. in 2006. Radisys continued buying assets when it purchased part of Intel's communications business for about $30 million in 2007. After five-straight quarterly losses, the company posted a profit of $481,000 in their 2009 fourth quarter. In May 2011, the company announced they were buying Continuous Computing for $105 million in stock and cash. Once the transaction was completed in July 2011, Continuous' CEO Mike Dagenais became the CEO of RadiSys. Dagenais left the company in October 2012 with former CFO Brian Bronson taking over as CEO. In 2018, Reliance Industries acquired Radisys. Arun Bhikshesvaran took over as CEO in July 2019. Operations Company headquarters The company's headquarters are located in the Dawson Creek Industrial Park adjacent to the headquarters of FEI Company in Hillsboro, Oregon, within the Portland metropolitan area. Radisys in 2015 had approximately 700 employees located in offices in the United States (Oregon), India (Bangalore), China (Shenzhen), and Canada (Burnaby, BC).[1] Overall, the company only builds about 15 percent of their products, with the remainder outsourced to other companies.[1] Products Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to as original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1] The company has engineering groups, working on open telecom architectures, computer architecture and systems integration. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1] See also * RMX (operating system) * Silicon Forest * TenAsys * List of companies based in Oregon References External links * Category:Computer companies of the United States Category:Embedded systems Category:Companies based in Hillsboro, Oregon Category:Manufacturing companies based in Oregon Category:Computer companies established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Oregon Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Reliance Industries subsidiaries Category:1995 initial public offerings Category:2018 mergers and acquisitions Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies ","title":"Radisys"},{"id":"2622544","text":"WPYR (1380 AM) is an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

On March 7, 2003 Norfolk Southern sold the line between Hilton and Dothan to the Chattahoochee and Gulf railroad, a Gulf & Ohio subsidiary. The railroad connected to another G&O; subsidiary, the H and S Railroad, at Dothan. Another railroad group, Genesee and Wyoming Inc., expanded into the region in 2003 and 2005 with acquisition of the Chattahoochee Industrial Railroad and Bay Line Railroad, respectively. As the Chattahoochee & Gulf connected with both subsidiaries, G&W; sought to fill the gap and purchased the C&G; as well as the H&S; in 2006. Both railroads were then merged into a single operation, named the Chattahoochee Bay Railroad. This gave Genesee & Wyoming a contiguous route from the paper mill at Cedar Springs, Georgia to the port of Panama City, Florida, allowing for more efficient operation under the unified carrier. The Chattahoochee Bay railroad totals and interchanges with CSX Transportation and the Bay Line Railroad at Dothan, as well as Norfolk Southern and the Chattahoochee Industrial Railroad at Hilton.

Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to LeHand's biographer, Kathryn Smith, in \\"The Gatekeeper,\\" she eventually functioned as White House chief of staff, the only woman in American history to do so. Born into a blue collar Irish-American family in upstate New York, LeHand studied secretarial science in high school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Franklin Roosevelt vice presidential campaign in New York. Following the Democrats' defeat, FDR's wife Eleanor invited her to join the family at their home in Hyde Park, New York to clean up the campaign correspondence. FDR subsequently hired LeHand to work for him on Wall Street, where he was the partner in a law firm and also worked for a bonding company. After FDR was partially paralyzed in August 1921, LeHand became his daily companion and one of the main people to encourage him to return to politics, along with Eleanor and his political strategist, Louis McHenry Howe. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts and died after another stroke in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was romantically involved with William C. Bullitt Jr., U.S. ambassador to Russia and later France, from 1933 to 1940, but apparently never contemplated marriage to him. Her devotion to the Roosevelt family and dedication to her career were the most likely impediments to marriage, though she once asked a friend, \\"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\\"  Early life  LeHand was born in Potsdam, New York, to Daniel J. and Mary J. (n√©e Graffin) LeHand, who were the children of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, when they were in their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial fibrillation and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left her delicate and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House. After holding a variety of clerical positions in the Boston area and passing the Civil Service exam, she moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917 to briefly serve as a clerk at the Department of the Navy during the First World War. FDR was serving as assistant secretary of the Navy then, but the two did not meet. At the recommendation of Charles McCarthy, Roosevelt's assistant at the Navy Department, she became a secretary with FDR's vice presidential campaign three years later when he ran on a ticket with James M. Cox against Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, LeHand's work on the campaign and her clear personal devotion to FDR caught the eye of the Roosevelts.Roosevelt, Eleanor, The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt, pp. 111‚Äì12, Da Capo Press, 1992 )Roosevelt, Elliott, An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, p. 129, Putnam Sons, 1973 ASIN: B001IOWZ4Q In early 1921, FDR hired her as his personal secretary and she moved to New York, sleeping on the sofa of a cousin's home in the Bronx. Roosevelt biographer Jean Edward Smith described the young LeHand as \\"five feet, seven inches tall ... warm and attractive, with ink-blue eyes, black hair already turning gray, and an engaging throaty voice. She was also modest, well mannered, exceptionally capable, and thoroughly organized.\\" She once described her early work with FDR thus: > The first thing for a private secretary to do is to study her employer. > After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the > letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which > ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. > Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. > When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his > shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he > could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.  Partner in illness, politics and the presidency  LeHand quickly became a key part of Roosevelt's staff, managing his correspondence and appointment calendar. She was nicknamed \\"Missy\\" by Roosevelt's younger children, who had a hard time negotiating \\"Miss LeHand\\" and soon became popularly known by this name. In turn, she nicknamed her boss \\"F.D.\\", a name only she used. In the summer of 1921, Roosevelt was struck by a disabling paralytic illness (diagnosed at the time as polio), leaving him paralyzed below the waist; LeHand soon became his inseparable companion. Each winter in the mid-1920s, FDR would spend four months on his houseboat, Larooco, off the Florida coast. LeHand lived with him and acted as his hostess. She also accompanied him to the spa town of Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1924 overseeing and encouraging his physical therapy. Together, they worked to establish the first polio rehabilitation facility in the country, which was incorporated as a nonprofit organization, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, in 1927. That spring, LeHand suffered what she described as a \\"heart attack\\" while swimming in the pool at Warm Springs. She was treated for resulting atrial fibrilation with digitalis, which provoked a toxic reaction and mental confusion. (Some of her contemporaries later told historians that she had suffered a mental breakdown, which contributed to a perception of emotional instability.) LeHand opposed FDR's plan to run for Governor of New York in 1928, telling him, \\"Don't you dare\\". She feared he would lose his chance to walk again if he interrupted his therapy. When he ultimately decided to run, she suffered another illness that was also often described as a nervous breakdown. By the time he was elected and assumed office, however, she was well enough to resume work and moved into the second floor of the Governor's Mansion in Albany, continuing on as his secretary. With Eleanor often away working in New York City during this time (she was part owner of an elite girls' school), LeHand was not only FDR's day- to-day companion but also the back-up hostess at the Governor's Mansion. During her long tenure as FDR's secretary, LeHand came to share many of his likes and dislikes. She enthusiastically learned to play poker, and would spend hours working with him on his stamp collection. She even adopted his figures of speech and favorite drinks. Eleanor Roosevelt disapproved of alcohol, and Missy served as hostess at FDR's daily cocktail time, which he later dubbed \\"the Children's Hour.\\" After a second term as governor, Roosevelt was elected President of the United States in November 1932, assuming the office in March 1933. LeHand accompanied the Roosevelts to the White House, where she became the first woman to serve as a presidential secretary and the only female member of the four-person \\"secretariat\\" that managed the West Wing. (The other three were Louis McHenry Howe, Steve Early and Marvin H. McIntyre. Missy earned half the salary of the men.) As her obituary in the New York Times said, \\"when her employer was elected to the Presidency, it had become an established fact that neither other offers of employment or proposals of marriage could entice the prematurely gray and handsome young woman from the career she had chosen.\\" During Roosevelt's tenure as president, LeHand became a federal employee. Until the 1941 stroke that incapacitated her, she lived on the third floor of the White House and continued to manage Roosevelt's daily business, also presiding as the White House hostess during Eleanor's absences. In August 1933, Newsweek ran a profile of her describing her as FDR's \\"Super-Secretary\\", making her nationally famous. She also appeared on the cover of Time magazine in December 1934, one of just three women to grace a Time cover that year. In 1937 she was listed as one of the best-dressed women in Washington. LeHand's importance as an adviser and gatekeeper to FDR grew during the second term. Following Howe's death in 1936, she became the de facto White House chief of staff, and was seen as one of the most powerful people in the administration. She met with the other members of the secretariat around FDR's bedside every morning, vetted his mail, provided a \\"back door\\" entrance to the Oval Office‚Äîwhich adjoined hers alone‚Äîand spent many evenings with the president in his upstairs study, as well as accompanying him on weekend cruises on the presidential yachts, the Sequoia and its successor, the Potomac. Because FDR could not be awakened after he went to bed at night without LeHand's permission, she was the first person to learn by telephone that Hitler had invaded Poland in September 1939, setting off World War II. Samuel I. Rosenman, a close FDR adviser and speechwriter, called her \\"one of the most important people of the Roosevelt era.\\"  Relationship with Roosevelt  Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 The question of whether LeHand and Roosevelt's relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries and continues to be debated by historians. Hazel Rowley argues that \\"there is no doubt that Franklin's relationship with Missy was romantic\\", but notes the possibility that the relationship could not have been consummated due to FDR's disability. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin states that \\"beneath the complexity, it is absolutely clear that Franklin was the love of Missy's life, and that he adored her and depended on her for affection and support as well as work\\". Doug Wead wrote in his work on the parents of presidents, The Raising of a President, \\"Some Roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated. Eleanor and the children accepted the relationship, which speaks for its innocence. Sara [Roosevelt] spoke favorably of Missy's family and upbringing. Years later, only Elliott, of all the children, would declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe.\\"Wead, Doug, The Raising of a President: The Mothers and Fathers of Our Nation's Leaders, p. 180, Simon and Schuster, 2005 In 1973, FDR's son Elliott published An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, in which he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she \\"shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father\\". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too difficult for him to have a physical affair. \\"I suppose you could say they came to love one another\\", he wrote, \\"but it was not a physical love.\\" Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, \\"As far as evidence goes, there is not a single written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms‚Äîwhich he used as an auxiliary office‚Äîduring their twenty-one years together.\\" She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, \\"We have no reason to believe they did [have a sexual relationship], but we don't know.\\" Despite LeHand's close relationship with Franklin, she and his wife Eleanor (pictured) remained on good terms. Eleanor and LeHand remained on good terms. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook describes the First Lady as treating LeHand warmly, \\"as an elder daughter or, in the manner of Asian matriarchs, as the junior wife\\". The two women went shopping together, and Eleanor took a solicitous interest in LeHand's smoking and general health. Eleanor also accompanied LeHand to her mother's funeral in Potsdam during the first presidential campaign in 1932, helping the family make arrangements. Elliott later stated that he believed \\"Missy alleviated Mother's guilt\\", allowing her to travel without worrying that Franklin would lack for companionship. In one of her later books, Eleanor wrote that she occasionally failed to \\"meet the need of someone whom I dearly love\\", stating, \\"You must learn to allow someone else to meet the need, without bitterness or envy, and accept it.\\" Cook reads these passages as veiled references to LeHand's role in Franklin's life, and Eleanor's acceptance of that role. = Other relationships = LeHand had a brief romance with Eleanor's bodyguard (and rumored love) Earl Miller in 1931. Miller later told biographer Joseph Lash that he had begun the affair out of respect for Eleanor, feeling that she was hurt by LeHand's relationship with Franklin. In 1933, LeHand began to date the diplomat William Christian Bullitt, Jr., who became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union late that year. FDR's son James later described this as \\"the one real romance\\" of her life. While some historians have stated that LeHand broke off the engagement after discovering Bullitt was having an affair with a Bolshoi Ballet dancer or that he \\"dumped\\" her, correspondence between the two makes it clear LeHand broke off the relationship in September 1940, after Bullitt returned to the United States from Nazi-occupied France and began demanding more of her time. The length and depth of LeHand's relationship with William C. Bullitt raises questions about FDR being the true love of her life. FDR aide and confidant Harry Hopkins, a widower, was close friends with Missy, especially after he moved into the White House himself in 1940. Goodwin states while the pair were close enough to spark Washington gossip, nothing appears to have come of it: \\"Missy had probably cut it short, as she had cut short every other relationship in her life that might subordinate her great love for FDR.\\" Smith does not cite Hopkins as a serious contender for LeHand's affections.  Illness, death, and memorials  In June 1941, LeHand collapsed at a White House dinner party and two weeks later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that may have led to her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess M√§rtha of Sweden, a Washington- area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying the seat next to him that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. She had also become critical of FDR's leadership for the first time that spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that the principal would be divided equally among his children while half the income of his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) would go to Eleanor and half to \\"my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime.\\" (As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.) He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire‚Äîprobably while smoking‚Äîit was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942. An assistant of LeHand's, Grace Tully, took over as Roosevelt's secretary, but was never a companion for Roosevelt in the same way as LeHand had been. After Missy departed the White House, she never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, phone calls and by sending gifts. When LeHand died on July 31, 1944, the president issued a statement: > Memories of more than a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense > of personal loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and > painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, > she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet > efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory > will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by > all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties > brought them into contact with her. Eleanor Roosevelt attended LeHand's funeral in Cambridge, Massachusetts, over which Bishop (later Cardinal) Richard Cushing presided. Other mourners included Associate Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and former ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy. The president's words \\"She was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty\\" appear on LeHand's marker at Mount Auburn Cemetery. In her will, LeHand left the furniture in her White House apartment to Grace Tully and the First Couple. According to LeHand's great-niece Jane Scarbrough, to this day, the Roosevelt family pays for the upkeep of the LeHand family plot. = SS Marguerite LeHand = In March 1945, the United States Maritime Commission christened an 18,000 ton C3 cargo vessel, the SS Marguerite LeHand, in Pascagoula, Mississippi. During her maiden voyage, she struck the U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse tender amidships, sinking it and killing one Coast Guardsman. To commemorate the 80th anniversary of LeHand's birth in 1976, the Somerville Public Library named its children's department after her. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Rep. Thomas P. \\"Tip\\" O'Neill, who had been invited by LeHand as a college student to meet the president in the White House. = Representations in television and film = LeHand was a character in the 1958 Broadway play Sunrise at Campobello and its 1960 film adaptation, in which she was played by Jean Hagen. The productions portray FDR's initial struggles with his paralytic illness, and his decision to continue his political career. Priscilla Pointer played the role of LeHand in the 1977 ABC television production Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years. She had a brief appearance in the 2005 HBO movie Warm Springs, which is about the creation of the polio rehabilitation center there and FDR's return to politics. She was played by Marianne Fraulo. In the 2012 movie Hyde Park on Hudson, which portrays the visit of British monarchs George VI and Queen Consort Elizabeth to FDR's estate at Hyde Park, LeHand is played by Elizabeth Marvel. LeHand's work and friendship with Franklin Roosevelt is chronicled in the 2014 documentary film The Roosevelts, directed by Ken Burns. References  Bibliography   Smith, Kathryn (2016).

The population was 579 at the 2010 census, which lists the community as a census-designated place (CDP). It is located 33 miles (53 kilometers) south of downtown Rochester, New York.Google driving direction from Downtown Rochester, NY to Honeoye Central School The community is at the north end of Honeoye Lake, one of the minor Finger Lakes. It is primarily situated along U.S. Route 20A (New York) between Ontario County Roads 33 and 37. The center of the hamlet can roughly be placed at the intersection of Route 20A and Ontario County Road 36 (West Lake Road). Due to its location at the northern tip of Honeoye Lake and seasonal recreational population, the hamlet contains several businesses, including gas stations and grocery, drug, liquor, hardware, auto-parts, and convenience stores. It also contains several restaurants, a doctor's office, dentist's office, and Honeoye Central School, which is K-12. There are also multiple churches, a fire station,Richmond Fire Department library, beach, park, state boat launch, and hiking trail. History The name Honeoye comes from the Seneca word ha-ne-a- yah, which means lying finger, or where the finger lies. The name comes from the local story of a Native American whose finger was bitten by a rattlesnake and who therefore cut off his finger with a tomahawk. The area that is now the hamlet of Honeoye is thought to have first been inhabited by the Point Peninsula Indians more than 10,000 years ago. Following them came the Seneca, who settled their village at the northeast part of Honeoye Lake, just north of the present-day community of Honeoye Lake Park. During the American Revolution, this Seneca village was destroyed by General John Sullivan in September 1779 as part of his campaign to eliminate the threat from the Iroquois, most of whose nations were allied with the British. At the site of the Indian village, Sullivan's troops built a small garrison known as Fort Cummings, named for the commanding officer left in charge. Here they left their \\"sick, lame and lazy\\" as well as a large portion of their supplies, so they could quickly enter the Genesee country to the west and drive the Seneca from the frontier. After the War, some of these soldiers chose to return and resettle in western New York because of its fertile soil. Some land was paid as bounty to war veterans. Captain Peter Pitts was the first European-American to settle the area of present-day Honeoye, where he established Pittstown (now Richmond) in 1789. In the mid-19th century, this area had numerous abolitionists, feminists, and other progressive activists. Stations of the Underground Railroad were founded in western New York to help convey escaped slaves to freedom in Canada. The Seneca Falls Convention for women's rights took place in the nearby town. Honeoye remained a largely agricultural community until the early part of the 20th century, when many wealthy people from Rochester, New York took interest in Honeoye Lake as a resort area. Its relatively shallow depth gave it warmer temperatures than the Great Lakes. In the 1920s the City of Rochester took interest in the lake as a source of municipal water and created some plans to flood Honeoye Valley behind a dam, but since the city already was getting water from Canadice and Hemlock lakes, this never took place. Since then, the area has remained popular for vacationers. Geography The Hamlet of Honeoye lies just north of Honeoye Lake on Honeoye Creek and lies at the bottom of Honeoye Valley. The climate of Honeoye is typical of the northeastern United States with four distinct seasons including warm, humid summers and cold snowy winters. Honeoye is located at (42.7900646, -77.5169374) and its elevation is . According to the 2010 United States Census, the CDP has a total area of , all of which is land. Demographics As a hamlet with no legally defined boundaries, there are no US Census Bureau demographic data specific to Honeoye. Generally, residents of the encompassing town of Richmond identify themselves with Honeoye, and so one could refer to the demographic data for the Town of Richmond. Richmond, NY Demographic Data Economy The hamlet of Honeoye is home to several dozen small businesses that provide services to many surrounding towns and communities, including all or parts of Canadice, Bristol, South Bristol, and Livonia. Many of the businesses are members of the Honeoye Chamber of Commerce. Most of the businesses see their best business in the summer months, when population is increased by seasonal residents. Winter visitors also come to the area, for the exceptional ice fishing on Honeoye Lake and skiing and related activities at two local ski resorts: Bristol Mountain and Hunt Hollow. Cross-country skiers often visit Harriet Hollister-Spencer State Park in the southern part of Canadice and Ontario County Park in South Bristol. While once thriving in such a small community, manufacturing in Honeoye downsized from five companies to two over the last 20 years or more, mainly due to the lack of rail access or a major highway. In March 2012, Stone Construction Equipment closed their doors leaving only CY Plastics & Roome Technologies as the only manufacturers. The local economy is almost limited to agriculture provided by farms in the area and seasonal tourism generated by Honeoye Lake. Education =Public school= Honeoye and the surrounding area are included in the Honeoye Central School District. The district is served by one building providing schooling for all of the district's K-12 students. Enrollment at Honeoye Central is about 600 students. The school mascot is the bulldog and the colors are Royal blue and white, with red as an occasional accent color. The French department maintains connections with Lyc√©e Br√©quigny in Rennes, France, which serves as a kind of sister school. The English Department in the French high school and the French department in Honeoye provide opportunities for students to travel and live in the opposite country, to experience the culture with a student and his or her family. Local sports Honeoye Central School competes within the NYSPHAA Section V. Currently sports are classified in the D to CC range, depending on the sport. The school also competes in the Finger Lakes West League with strong traditional rivalries with neighboring schools Bloomfield and Naples. In recent years Honeoye Sports have achieved success in girls volleyball with Section V championships in 2004, 2012, 2015 and 2016 and several Sectional final appearances, girls Soccer with a Section V championship in 2005 and several Sectional final appearances, boys Soccer with ten consecutive sectional appearances, recent league titles in 2004, 2008, 2009, a #1 Class C State-Ranking in 2009, and a Section V Class CC championship in 2008, 2015 and 2016. cross country with several runners competing in sectional and state competitions, and six consecutive Wayne Finger Lakes West League Titles, Golf, with several golfers competing in league and sectional competitions, and a streak of 56 straight team wins was snapped in early 2006, girls basketball with a section V championship in 2006, a NYSPHAA West Regional Championship in 2006 and a New York State Final Four appearance in 2006, indoor track with several athletes competing in sectional and state competitions, boys baseball with three consecutive sectional final appearances, 2008 Section V class CCC Championship, 2008 NYSPHAA West Regional Championship, and a New York State Final 4 appearance and girls softball with several sectional final appearances. Honeoye athletes have also been recognized by league, region and state committees as all-stars, players of the year and most valuable players. The district has won back-to-back sectional titles in both Volleyball and Cross Country (2015/2016) Culture and recreation Honeoye and the surrounding community are recognized mainly for the lake and its recreational value including water sports, fishing, and ice fishing. The steep valleys of the area also provide excellent snow skiing in the winter at two primary resorts: Bristol Mountain and Hunt Hollow. Honeoye is also located near the Finger Lakes wine viticultural area. Several parks also surround the area including: Sandy Bottom Beach and Nature Trail, Harriet Hollister-Spencer State Recreation Area, and Ontario County Park. Honeoye was previously famous for its annual winter carnival beginning in 1961, but the carnival was discontinued after 1971 because the small community could not support the large number of patrons. In 2005, Honeoye brought back an annual event dubbed The Captain Red Beard's Feast in early September (usually Labor Day weekend.)Annual pirate festival lands in Honeoye In the wintertime, the area is also a popular snowmobiling area, with over 100 miles of marked and partially groomed NYS Corridor snowmobile trails, connecting to the neighboring communities of Bloomfield, Hemlock, Naples, and Wayland. Honeoye is often viewed as more of a community rather than just a hamlet. Many residents of the area often identify themselves with Honeoye before identifying with their own town. Media Honeoye is served by Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo television and radio stations. It is also included in the coverage area of the Canandaigua Daily Messenger, Rochester's Democrat & Chronicle. Honeoye has also been served by a weekly newspaper, The Honeoye Herald/The Naples Record, though publication has since ceased.http://www.mpnnow.com/x1551267071/Wanted-Buyer-for-The-Naples-Record Notable residents * Helen Pitts Douglass - abolitionist, feminist, and second wife of Frederick Douglass * Jeannette Klute - Kodak research photographer who demonstrated color photography as an art form * Brian Kolb (R) - representative to the New York State Assembly, 129th District See also * Finger Lakes AVA References External links * Town of Richmond * Honeoye Valley Association * Honeoye Bulldogs Boys Soccer * Hill and Valley Riders *Honeoye Lake Webcam Category:Hamlets in New York (state) Category:Census-designated places in New York (state) Category:Census-designated places in Ontario County, New York Category:New York (state) wine Category:Hamlets in Ontario County, New York ","title":"Honeoye, New York"},{"id":"2622578","text":"An aspergillum (sprinkler) and silver ewer of holy water on the altar, prepared for asperges (Cathedral Church of Saint Matthew, Dallas, Texas).

This Renewal of Baptismal Vows, along with Asperges, is common among Lutherans and Anglicans as well. During the Funeral Mass, the casket is blessed with holy water and incense. The priest blesses the water with one of the three prayers proposed (one of which is reserved for Eastertide). He may also bless salt and put it in the water, if local conditions or custom of the people favours doing so. Then he takes a sprinkler (called in Latin and sometimes in English an \\"aspersorium\\", and in English referred to also as an aspergil), and sprinkles the clergy and people, preferably walking through the church to do so. While the sprinkling is being done, an antiphon or a hymn is sung. The Roman Missal proposes several, based on the following verses of Scripture: *Outside of Eastertide    * During Eastertide  and  and   But other suitable hymns are permitted. Often, the antiphon Asperges Me is sung, except during the Easter season and on Palm Sunday, when it is replaced by the more lengthy and florid antiphon, Vidi aquam. Earlier form Incipit of the standard Gregorian chant setting of the Asperges, from the Liber Usualis. Where the 1962 Latin Missal is used, the Asperges is done before the principal Mass on Sunday, except on Palm Sunday, when it is replaced with the blessing of palms followed by a procession.The Asperges rite was suppressed on Palm Sunday with the 1955 Holy Week reforms of Pope Pius XII; prior to the 1956 implementation of these reforms, the Asperges was, in fact, conducted even on Palm Sunday. The Asperges is so called from the words intoned at the beginning of the ceremony, taken from Psalm 50:3, throughout the year except at Eastertide, when Vidi aquam (based on Ezechiel 47), with Psalm 116:1, is intoned. It precedes every other ceremony that may take place before the Mass, such as the blessing of palms or of candles. It is performed by the celebrant priest wearing a cope of the liturgical color of the day; the chasuble is never worn for the Asperges, or any other ceremony not strictly part of the Mass, in the traditional rite. It is omitted when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, though many rubricists think that the sprinkling of the altar only, not of the congregation, should then be omitted. After intoning the antiphon the priest recites the psalm Miserere or Confitemini, according to the season, sprinkling first the front and platform of the altar, then himself, next the ministers and choir, and lastly the congregation, usually walking through the main part of the church, though he need not go beyond the gate of the sanctuary or choir. The ceremony has been in use at least from the tenth century, growing out of the custom of early antiquity of blessing water for the faithful on Sundays. Its object is to prepare the congregation for the celebration of the Mass by moving them to sentiments of penance and reverence suggested by the words of the 50th psalm, or by impressing on them that they are about to assist at the sacrifice of our redemption as suggested in the psalm used at Easter time. Both the Asperges and the Vidi aquam are structured like the Introit of the Tridentine Mass: 1st verse (which includes Alleluias in Eastertide), 2nd verse (always from the Psalms), Gloria Patri (omitted in Passiontide), and then the 1st verse again.

From left to right: A priest's kamilavka and epitrachelion (stole), Euchologion, bowl of water, blessing cross, candle, aspergillum made of basil branches, incense (Muzeul Na≈£ional de ArtƒÉ, Bucharest). In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the sprinkling of holy water takes place on numerous occasions. The most important is on the Great Feast of Theophany (Epiphany) following the Great Blessing of Waters at the end of the Divine Liturgy. The Great Blessing takes place twice: once on the Eve of the feast, and once on the day of the feast. At both blessings, the priest sprinkles the entire temple (church building) and the faithful. He then begins the process of going to each family's home to sprinkle it with the blessed \\"Theophany water\\". Some monasteries and churches have the tradition of blessing holy water and sprinkling on the first day of each month. There are also several feast days during the year when sprinkling with holy water is prescribed, such as Bright Friday (Friday in Easter Week), the Feast of the Procession of the Cross on the first day of the Dormition Fast, and the Feast of Mid-Pentecost (25 days after Easter), when the fields are blessed with holy water. Certain ceremonies will also call for the blessing of holy water, such as the consecration of a church. The form of aspergillum (holy water sprinkler) may differ from place to place. The Greek Orthodox will use a randistirion which is a standing vessel with a tapered lid. The tip of the lid is pierced with small holes, from which the holy water is sprinkled. The Russian Orthodox will use a whisk made of cotton, straw or hair from which the holy water is flung. The blessing takes place at a holy water font or baptismal font which has been placed in the center of the temple. There are two types of blessings: the Great Blessing of Waters (used on Theophany) and the Lesser Blessing of Waters (used at other times). After blessing the holy water, the priest will bless himself and drink some of the holy water. He then stands next to the holy water font holding a blessing cross in his left hand and the aspergillum in his right. Each of the clergy and faithful come forward, drink a little of the newly blessed holy water and then kiss the cross in the priest's hand as he sprinkles them on the head with holy water. During this process, the choir will chant hymns, which differ depending upon the type of blessing being celebrated. He will also sprinkle the sanctuary and the entire church.

Extremities of the cross are amplified, and its ends are concaved. The double cross is a symbol of its Christian faith and the hills represent three symbolic mountain ranges: Tatra, Fatra (made up of the Veƒæk√° Fatra and Mal√° Fatra ranges), and Matra (in northern Hungary). Modern design history The Byzantine double cross on great Moravian rings In 1990, the Slovak Interior Ministry tasked Ladislav ƒåis√°rik (a painter and heraldic artist) and Ladislav Vrtel (an expert in heraldry) with creating a new coat of arms and national flag in the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution. ƒåis√°rik and Vrtel based their designs for a modern coat of arms and flag on an existing 14th Century coat of arms. However, ƒåis√°rik and Vrtel chose to enlarge the double cross three times to emphasize it as a national symbol. In addition to the national coat of arms and the national flag, the duo also designed a new presidential standard, which incorporates the double cross as well.  Double cross  One of the modern interpretations of the double cross is that it represents Slovakia as an heir and guardian of Christian tradition, brought to the region by St. Cyril and St. Methodius, two missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. The two- barred cross in the Slovak coat of arms originated in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire in the 9th century. Unlike the Christian cross, the symbolism and meaning of the double cross is not well understood. One interpretation is that the first horizontal line symbolized the secular power and the other horizontal line the ecclesiastic power of Byzantine emperors. Another that the first cross represents the death and the second cross the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the Byzantine Empire of the 9th century, the double cross was a political symbol used by Byzantine clerks and missionaries. Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary (1000‚Äì1038) The double cross arrived in the territory of current-day Slovakia probably no later than during the 9th century mission of Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. Though used frequently in Great Moravia, it was not a state symbol at that time, because there were no state symbols in the modern sense in Europe at that time yet. By means of Zwentibold (the ruler of Lorraine, son of the German emperor Arnulf of Carinthia and godchild of the Great Moravian king Svatopluk I), this symbol got to Lorraine and is called the cross of Lorraine there. The double cross symbol appeared again in rudimentary features on the first coins that Stephen I, the first king of the Kingdom of Hungary (part of which now forms the territory of present-day Slovakia), had minted at an unknown place. Before he became king in 1000, he was the Grand Prince of the Principality of Hungary and was living there with his Bavarian wife Gisella. The frequent opinion that the double cross was a cross that the Pope granted to Stephen I. around 1000 is still disputed. The opinion arose only in the 15th century based on a legend from the 12th century, which in addition only says that Stephen received an apostolic cross (i.e. a normal, not a double cross). The direct predecessor of the current coat of arms of Slovakia can be found in the coat of arms used by B√©la, the prince of the Hungarian Duchy (1046‚Äì1060) and later King of Hungary. B√©la was a member of the house of √Årp√°ds and was named after the Prague bishop Adalbert, who had baptized King Stephen, the cousin of B√©la's father, some decades ago. B√©la conducted his own internal and international policy in his Nitrian frontier principality. The Byzantine emperor, involved in a quarrel with the Hungarian king, even sent B√©la a prince's crown to Nitra. Furthermore, B√©la had own coins minted in 1050 in Nitra, the capital of his principality ‚Äì coins which deliberately differed from those of the Hungarian king and which bore the double cross symbol. The appearance of the double cross in coins before B√©la III is highly disputed. According to recent view It is a simple misinterpretation of two normal crosses.Koln√≠k: Byzantsk√© korene ikonografie a symboliky ≈°t√°tneho znaku Slovenskej republiky Historick√Ω Zborn√≠k, 1999. 9. 13‚Äì32. p. It was only 100 years later, around 1189, that the double cross is known to have been used again ‚Äì it was used during a crusade of the Hungarian king B√©la III as his royal symbol. The three hills seen in the modern Slovak and Hungarian coats of arms were still not present in the standard. This time, the symbol was already used as a coat of arms, because coats of arms became fashionable in Europe at that time. He chose the symbol, because it was a Christian symbol and because it was the oldest symbol used in his kingdom. B√©la's successors Emeric and Andrew II, however, did not use anymore the double cross, which was associated with the Nitrian frontier principality situated in the northern part of the kingdom and dissolved in 1107, as their symbol, but they used a red-and-white- stripes symbol associated with the House of √Årp√°ds (see the coat of arms of Hungary for a picture). King B√©la IV used the patriarchal cross again ‚Äì the reasons for this decision are unknown. Some historians suggest that he simply copied B√©la III, his ideal, though this is only an assumption. At the time of his rule, the patriarchal cross also became the symbol of the Pozsony (Pre≈°porok, Bratislava or Pressburg) county, although in a slightly modified form. The last √Årp√°d king, Andrew III (1290‚Äì1301), used only the patriarchal cross. During the throne struggles after 1301, Ladislaus used the double cross as his symbol (see chapter \\"Three hills\\" for details), while Charles Robert of Anjou (1307‚Äì1342) used a bipartite coat of arms consisting of the Angevin symbol and the above-mentioned stripes symbol of King Stephen V, whose daughter Maria Charles Robert had married. After the Mongol invasion in 1241‚Äì1242 many of the newly founded towns in the Kingdom of Hungary received the right to use the royal double cross as their coat of arms. The first, biggest and most towns of the kingdom arose in present-day Slovakia - the part of the kingdom that was characterized by German settlers, extensive mining activities and thus the most advanced economy at that time. It was probably partly due to this use in municipal coats of arm that the double cross became a clear symbol of the northern part of the kingdom again from the 15th century onwards and Upper Hungary from the 18th century. From the late 14th century onwards (according to other sources from the 13th century), the double cross symbol was used both as a symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (\\"partes Danubii septentrionales, partes regni superiores\\", i.e. approximately the territory of present-day Slovakia and northeastern Hungary) and as a symbol of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. For example, the state symbol of Louis the Great (1342‚Äì1382) was a quartered coat of arms containing among other symbols the symbol of Charles Robert of Anjou (containing in turn the stripes symbol) as the symbol for the southern parts of the kingdom (\\"partes regni inferiores\\") and the symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (the double cross symbol). A good example of the double meaning of the double cross symbol is the great seal of King Sigismund of Luxembourg (1387‚Äì1437): This seal contains the double cross symbol in the middle, surrounded by a circle of smaller coats of arms of territories under his rule. These smaller coats of arms include the double cross symbol (for a second time!) as the symbol of what is today Slovakia and the stripes symbol as the symbol for Pannonia. Since 1526, when the Habsburgs became kings of the Kingdom of Hungary, the current \\"combined\\" coat of arms of Hungary including the double cross symbol and the stripes symbol was used as the symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary (except that the small crown below the double cross was added only in the 17th century).  Three hills  The triple peak represents the three mountain ranges Tatra, Matra and Fatra which symbolized the northern mountainous part of the Kingdom of Hungary. (The Tatra and the Fatra ranges are in present day Slovakia.) This interpretation is probably the oldest and most frequent one ‚Äì it can be traced back to the 16th century, but stems probably from the 15th century. According to Istv√°n Werb≈ëczy's \\"Tripartitum\\" from 16th century, the heaps represent the mountains in this order. The three mountains below the double cross were used by King Ladislaus (1301‚Äì1305), who was crowned king of Hungary, but was a Czech from the house of the P≈ôemyslids. Symbol of the Slovaks =Origins and colors= Slovak Uprising of 1848 was one of the first depictions of Slovak coat of arms with three hills in blue colour. On this flag, whole Hungarian coat of arms was adopted, along with √Årp√°d stripes Coat of arms of Slovak Soviet Republic (16 June 1919 ‚Äì 7 July 1919) Coat of Arms of Czechoslovak Legion, which was used before creation of official Czechoslovak symbols. Occasionally it was depicted with green hills Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia (1920‚Äì1960), until federalization of Czechoslovakia Coat of arms of First Slovak Republic (1939‚Äì1945) Symbol of the Slovak Socialist Republic within Czechoslovakia (1960‚Äì1990) Not later than in the 16th century, the Slovaks regarded the double cross also as a symbol of their nation. This fact manifested itself during the Revolution of 1848/1849, Slovaks were fighting along with the Austrians against the Hungarians (though many Slovaks chose to defend the Hungarian case). A \\"Slovak National Council\\" was established for this purpose in August 1848 in Vienna. The present-day coat of arms was used on the seal of this Slovak National Council for the first time officially as the national symbol of the Slovaks (instead of being the official symbol of Upper Hungary only). From that time onwards, the symbol has been used very frequently. As for the colors, the colors are supposed to be the three \\"Slavic\\" colors red-white-blue (Slavic tricolor). Since the Upper Hungary coat of arms was already part of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Hungary at that time, only the color of the three mountains had to be changed (it happened on the Slovak flag for the first time) from green to \\"blue\\" to receive the red-white-blue combination. As for the origin of the red color (in the Slovak and in the Hungarian coat of arms), the coat of arms has often had the red color as an almost inseparable attendant of the double cross in the coats of many Hungarian and Slovak towns since the Middle Ages. Also, the coat of arms of B√©la III. is thought to have had red background. In general, red background color was used frequently for coats of arms in the late 12th and early 13th century in central Europe. One of the modern interpretations of the color is that it represents the bloody lining and symbolizes the Slovak 'martyrdom' during the time of Magyarisation (19th century). The color of the three mountains was originally green but in 1848 the Slovak National Council used it as blue in accordance with the Slavic tricolor. =20th century= In 1918, Czechoslovak troops began occupying northern Hungary in accordance with the territorial promises that the Triple Entente made to Czechoslovak politicians during World War I. However, Slovakia (Upper Hungary) was occupied by Hungarian troops from the Hungarian Soviet Republic, who set up the Slovak Soviet Republic as a puppet regime. Its emblem was the red star, a symbol of communism. Following a brief war between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania, Slovakia was incorporated into Czechoslovakia. In 1920 the Slovak coat of arms became part of the state coat of arms of Czechoslovakia. Between 1939 and 1945, it was the state symbol of the First Slovak Republic. In 1945, it became part of Czechoslovakia's coat of arms again. From 1960 to 1990 the symbol was officially forbidden, because it was interpreted by the Communists as the symbol of the fascist Slovak State. The old coat of arms was replaced in the Czechoslovak coat of arms by an artificial symbol consisting of Mt. Kriv√°≈à and three flames. The three flames were supposed to symbolize the Slovak National Uprising of 1944. On 1 March 1990, after the Velvet Revolution, the old coat of arms became the official symbol of the \\"Slovak Republic\\", which was still part of Czechoslovakia. Based on the Constitution of the Slovak Republic of September 3, 1992, the same coat of arms became the symbol of independent Slovakia, which arose on January 1, 1993. A law of February 18, 1993, precised the details of the coat of arms: for example, though not explicitly defined in the coat's blazon in the past, during the World War II era the cross mostly used to be depicted with convex endings of the stake and the bars; therefore the new description clearly reads to depict them as concave. The coat of arms is used by the Slovak Air Force as its roundel. Since 1992 the coat of arms is also placed on the Slovak flag. = Part of other symbols= Flag of the President of Slovakia In the 13th century King B√©la III declared the double cross (ex post) a symbol of Saint Ladislaus (King Ladislaus I of Hungary). In 1386, it became part of the coat of arms of the house of Jagiello, because Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila took over the alleged coat of arms of Saint Ladislaus when being baptized as Ladislaus (Wladyslaw). By means of the Jagiellons, the symbol also got into the coat of arms of Lithuania. The President of Slovakia uses a banner of these arms. Slovak graphic designer Branislav Novotka designed a greater coat of arms of Slovakia and registered it at the Slovak Chamber of Genealogy and Heraldry. However, this coat of arms is no official symbol of Slovakia.

The Chautauqua Opera is the resident summer opera company of the Chautauqua Institution. It is one of the oldest continuously active summer opera companies in the U.S, having been founded in 1929 as the Chautauqua Opera Association, and it has produced several operas during the Institution's nine-week summer season every year since. Generally opera productions are performed in English in Norton Memorial Hall, usually on specific Monday and Friday evenings throughout the season. Recently, however, Chautauqua opera has increasingly been performed in concert productions at the Chautauqua Amphitheater. The first production director of the company was Alfredo Valenti, who began Chautauqua's rich opera tradition with Flotow's \\"Martha\\" on July 19, 1929. Henry Ford and Mrs. Thomas A. Edison were in the audience. Valenti, who served as director for twenty-eight years, championed young American singers such as Rose Bampton, who performed that season and in 1930 and who, like many other stars at Norton Hall (such as Charles Kullman and Helen Jepson) went on to fame at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere. Currently, the Chautauqua Opera is under the general direction of Jay Lesenger. The 2014 season included performances of Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe. The former was performed at the Amphitheater, along with two \\"pops\\" concerts; \\"The Ballad of Baby Doe\\" was performed at Norton Hall. This indicates a significant contraction of opera productions, which require substantial resources to rehearse and put on, and also suggests that Norton Hall is becoming less of the home for opera at Chautauqua; this pattern was repeated in 2015, with Verdi's Macbeth performed at the Amphitheater, and Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin performed at Norton Hall. In contrast, there were six separate productions at Norton Hall during the 1967 season. In addition, the Chautauqua Opera runs the Young Artists Program, training highly talented young singers who plan to pursue careers in operatic music. Members of the Young Artists program present recitals on Thursday afternoons at the Institution's Hall of Christ, as well as two concerts with the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra, and two revue performances during the summer season.

Parts of the former lake are now Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Nipissing. The lake varied in size, but it was at its biggest during the post- glacial period and gradually shrunk to the current Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. About 7,000 years ago, the lake was replaced by Lake Chippewa and Lake Stanley as the glaciers retreated and 3,000 years later by the current Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior. Physiography Summary of prehistoric beaches from the six glacial lakes that preceded the modern Lake Erie.About 11,000 years before present, the Laurentian Glacier has retreated northward, forming a boundary across the northern edges of Lake Superior and Lake Huron. The water level was at above sea level, creating a single body of water in the three basins of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Superior.Bulletin 4, The Glacial Lakes around Michigan; William R.

It received tributary drainage from smaller lakes in the south part of the Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe basins. Its existence is based on evidence of the establishment and erosion of its outlet through the distributaries of the St. Clair River at St. Clair, and on characters of the Niagara River and gorge. The steps of transition following this are simply physical and logical necessities, made so by the conditions of development from the first stage to the later fully developed Lake Algonquin, which included all three of the upper Great Lake basins. * Early Lake Algonquin 12,000 YBP formed in Lake Huron Basin. Drained through Port Huron and ancestral St. Clair River to Early Lake Erie. The Tolleston beach or Calumet beach of Lake Chicago drained across the Two Creeks waterway in central Michigan, into the early Lake Algonquin.Geological History of Glacial Lake Algonquin and the Upper Great Lakes; Curtis E.

Water levels continued to fluctuate. Four water tables existed long enough to form identifiable beaches. They include the Main Algonquin, Lower Algonquin, Battlefield and the Fort Brady beach levels. By 10,500 YBP the lake gained a lower outlet across the front of the glacier, creating the North Bay Outlet. Running in reverse to the modern French River, and across the divide into the ancestral Ottawa River. With water levels dropping, the two basins of Michigan and Huron, separated into individual lakes, entering the Lake Chippewa low phase in the Michigan Basin and the Lake Stanley Low Phase in the Huron Basin. =Early Lake Algonquin = Stages of lake development. The Early Lake Algonquin covered only part of Lake Huron. It included Saginaw Bay, but did not include Georgian Bay or any of the Lake Michigan or Lake Superior basins. Lake Chicago was in the southern portion of Lake Michigan and Lake Duluth was in the western tip of the Lake Superior basin. Lake water drained through the Port Huron outlet and down the St. Clair and Detroit rivers into Early Lake Erie. As the glacial front melted northward, the lake expanded in the Huron basin. When it retreated north of Alpena, Michigan, the waters of Lake Chicago merged with Early Lake Algonquin. The two lakes were nearly the same level and no change of altitude.

The screenplay was written by John Drimmer and Chip Proser, and was directed by Fred Schepisi. The cast included John Lone, Timothy Hutton, Lindsay Crouse, and Danny Glover. It was filmed in color with Dolby sound and ran for 100 minutes. The DVD version was released in 2004. Plot Anthropologist Stanley Shephard is brought to an arctic base when explorers discover the body of a prehistoric man who has been frozen for 40,000 years. After thawing the body to perform an autopsy, scientists first attemptand succeedto resuscitate the \\"iceman\\". The dazed caveman is alarmed by the surgical-masked figures; only Shephard has the presence of mind to remove his mask and reveal his humanity and somewhat familiar (bearded) face, permitting the iceman to settle into a peaceful recuperating sleep. The scientists place the iceman in an artificial, simulated environment for study, though the caveman quickly deduces that he is far from home. Shephard believes that the caveman's culture may provide clues to learning about the human body's adaptability, citing ceremonies such as firewalking. Other scientists see the potential in studying the caveman's DNA and his survival in the ice, for possible \\"freezing\\" of the sick until treatment is possible. Shephard defends the caveman's right to be considered a human being and not a scientific specimen. Despite opposition from the others, Shephard initiates an encounter with the caveman. Shephard names him \\"Charlie\\" after the iceman introduces himself as \\"Char-u\\". Shephard and Charlie bond, but it becomes obvious to the anthropologist that Charlie misses his world. A linguist is brought to the Arctic base, and the scientists make progress communicating with Charlie. Shephard introduces Charlie to colleague Dr. Diane Brady. Assuming that the woman is Shephard's mate, Charlie makes chalk marks which indicate that he likely was a married man with children before he was frozen. Shephard strives to understand what motivates Charlie and why he survived being frozen. At one point, Shephard begins to sing \\"Heart of Gold\\", inspiring Charlie to sing one of his own songs. Charlie's line drawings in the ground resemble a bird, matching body markings on his chest. When the base's helicopter strays over the roof of Charlie's area, he takes on an obsessive zeal as he climbs towards the roof. Shouting the word Beedha, he lifts his arms towards the helicopter in a sign of worship. Even though the helicopter pulls away from the dome, Shephard knows that Charlie can now think of nothing else. Shephard consults local Inuit who recognize the name that Charlie chanted and explain that it is a mythical bird, a messenger for the gods. Shephard understands that Charlie has a spiritual side and that he was on a dreamwalk pilgrimage, a mythical quest for redemption. His people were dying in the sudden ice age; he must have offered himself to the gods in the form of a self-sacrifice or appealing to the gods to redeem his tribe. Charlie escapes after watching Shephard exit the biosphere. In a panic of seeing unfamiliar modern devices, and believing they are his enemies, he spears Maynard, one of the base's technicians, before being recaptured and Shephard's experiment is put to an end. However, Shephard helps Charlie to escape into the wild. Charlie races on ahead of Shephard as they pass by glaciers and ice-shelves, and a crevasse opens up in front of Shephard, cutting him off from Charlie. When the helicopter emerges over an ice-shelf, Shephard looks on helplessly as Charlie grabs hold of one of its landing skis. In an attempt to evade Charlie's grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky. Charlie is ecstatic, believing the \\"messenger\\" is taking him to his god. He releases his grip, seeming to float through the sky while he plunges. Shephard's initial horror turns into joy, as he realizes that Charlie has reached his \\"dreamwalk\\" goal that he began 40,000 years earlier, even though it means his death.

Jewison still produced the film, which was eventually made under Australian director Fred Schepisi. Exteriors were filmed in British Columbia and Manitoba. Schepisi worked with Australian collaborators Ian Baker for cinematography and Bruce Smeaton for music. Reception =Box office= The film was released on April 13, 1984 grossing $1,836,120 (US). By the end of its four-week release, it grossed $7,343,032 (US). =Critical reception= Critic Richard Scheib said, \\"The film was part of a brief revival of the old caveman vs dinosaurs genre, along with Quest for Fire and Clan of the Cave Bear, in which earlier action-fantasy films were redressed with a much stricter regard to anthropological realism. Iceman, using modern science, became one of the more refreshingly intelligent films. The film is knowingly well-informed on anthropology and biochemistry and never resorts to cheap cliche or hackneyed elements.\\" Harlan Ellison called the film \\"magnificent\\", citing excellent acting (particularly on the part of John Lone) and directing that contribute to genuine emotional appeal. According to Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, the film is \\"spellbinding storytelling\\". \\"It begins with such a simple premise and creates such a genuinely intriguing situation that we're not just entertained, we're drawn into the argument [between using Charlie as a scientific specimen or a man]\\".

Origins  Callot Soeurs opened in 1895 at 24, rue Taitbout in Paris, France. It was operated by the four Callot sisters: Marie Callot Gerber, Marthe Callot Bertrand, Regina Callot Tennyson-Chantrell and Jos√©phine Callot Crimont. The eldest sister, Marie, was trained in dressmaking, having earlier worked for Raudnitz and Co., prominent Parisian dressmakers, and they were all taught by their mother, a lacemaker. The sisters began working with antique laces and ribbons to enhance blouses and lingerie. Their success led to an expansion into other clothing. In 1897, Jos√©phine committed suicide.  Growth and peak  In 1900, they were featured at the Paris World's Fair. That year, they had a staff of two hundred and did two million francs in sales. By 1901, they had tripled their workforce and doubled their sales. Callot Soeurs's day dresses were well received at the 1915 Universal Exhibition in San Francisco. In 1916, Henri Bendel was the largest buyer of Callot Soeurs in New York City. That same year, American Vogue dubbed the sisters the Three Fates, and declared them \\"foremost among the powers that rule the destinies of a woman's life and increase the income of France.\\" The sales room of the haute couture house Callot Soeur, c.1910. During World War I, American support was vital to the continued success of Callot Soeurs. While European sales fell, American buyers would order between 300 and 800 pieces every July. In response to the proliferation of knockoffs in the 1910s and 1920s, Callot Soeurs regularly placed advertisements in The New York Times listing the official retailers of their designs. In 1919, Callot Soeurs moved to larger premises at 9-11 Avenue Matignon. In 1920, Marthe Callot Bertrand suddenly died and the widowed Regina Callot Tennyson-Chantrell retired to care for her son. Marie Callot Gerber single-handedly ran the house for the next seven years. In the 1920s, Callot Soeurs established branches in Nice, Biarritz, Buenos Aires, and London. A January 1922 article in Ladies' Home Journal claimed that \\"Callot probably has more rich clients than any other establishment in the world. They come from South America, from South Africa, and as far east as Japan.\\" In 1926, the American designer Elizabeth Hawes, while working in Paris, regularly wore Callot Soeurs. Hawes insisted that people should wear what they personally liked, not what was considered fashionable, and although some American buyers at that time considering Callot Soeurs' dresses out of date and unfashionable, she happily wore their \\"simple clothes with wonderful embroidery\\" that lasted her for several years. Portrait of Rita de Acosta Lydig by Giovanni Boldini, 1911 Callot Soeurs's greatest American supporter was Rita de Acosta Lydig who ordered dozens of dresses at a time. According to her sister Mercedes de Acosta, \\"Rita designed most of her own clothes and they were made for her by Callot Soeurs.\\" Supposedly, Rita was such a fashion plate that when she learned her husband was having an affair with a poorly dressed woman, she sent the mistress to Callot Soeurs for new clothing. Rita wore a silver Callot Soeurs dress when she posed for Giovanni Boldini in 1911.  Later history  Marie Callot Gerber died in 1927. Her obituary in Le Figaro commented: \\"One of the most beautiful figures of the Parisian luxury business has now disappeared.\\" In 1928, Pierre Gerber, Marie Callot Gerber's son, took over the business but could not survive in the highly competitive market and, in 1937, the House of Callot Soeurs closed and was absorbed into the House of Calvet (Marie-Louise Calvet); under the Callot label. However, World War II made matters difficult in France. Similarly to what happened with the House of Vionnet in 1939, Calvet and the Callot label finally closed in 1952.  Influence and legacy  The couturier Madeleine Vionnet was head seamstress at Callot. It was here that she refined her technique in couture. She explained that \\"Without the example of the Callot Soeurs, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls-Royces.\\" Marie-Louise Bruy√®re was another designer who trained with the Callot Soeurs. Callot Soeurs clothing was known for its exotic detail. They were among the first designers to use gold and silver lam√© to make dresses. Twenty-one Callot Soeurs dresses are preserved in the Acton Art Collection at New York University's Villa La Pietra in Florence.

Autogas is the common name for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) when it is used as a fuel in internal combustion engines in vehicles as well as in stationary applications such as generators. It is a mixture of propane and butane. Autogas is widely used as a \\"green\\" fuel, as its use reduces exhaust emissions by around 15% compared to petrol. One litre of petrol produces 2.3 kg of when burnt, whereas the equivalent amount of autogas (1.33-litre due to lower density of autogas) produces only 1.5 * 1.33 = 2 kg of when burnt. CO emissions are 30% lower, compared to petrol and by 50%. It has an octane rating (MON/RON) that is between 90 and 110 and an energy content (higher heating value‚ÄîHHV) that is between 25.5 megajoules per litre (for pure propane) and 28.7 megajoules per litre (for pure butane) depending upon the actual fuel composition. Autogas is the third most popular automotive fuel in the world, with approximately 16 million of 600 million passenger cars powered using the fuel, representing less than 3% of the total market share. Approximately half of all autogas-fueled passenger vehicles are in the five largest markets (in descending order): Turkey, South Korea, Poland, Italy, and Australia. Terminology variations and confusion In countries where petroleum spirits is called petrol rather than gasoline, it is common for autogas to be simply referred to as gas. This can be confusing for people from countries where petrol is called gasoline, as they often use gas as an abbreviation of gasoline. In the United States, autogas is more commonly known under the name of its primary constituent, propane. In 2010 the Propane Education and Research Council adopted \\"Propane Autogas\\" to refer to LPG used in on-road motor vehicles. In the UK LPG and autogas are used interchangeably. In Australia and The Netherlands, the common terms is LPG. In Italy and France, GPL (an acronym for gas di petrolio liquefatto and gaz de p√©trole liqu√©fi√©) is used. In Spain the term GLP (gas licuado del petr√≥leo) is used. In Asian countries, particularly those with historical American influences, such as the Philippines, the term autogas is not commonly recognised as a generic term, and the use of the terms LPG or autoLPG is more widely used by consumers, especially by taxi drivers, many of whom use converted vehicles. The converted vehicles are commonly called LPG vehicles or LPG cars. =Difficulties with LPG as automotive fuel= Despite LPG being widely used as a fuel for cars, motorists in need of autogas can sometimes face difficulties, especially in remote areas and in places where supply and demand are low. Therefore, they may need to plan their journeys around access to stations where LPG can reliably be obtained. Some autogas fuel systems handle this by keeping both the autogas and petrol mechanisms ‚Äì allowing either autogas or petrol to be used at any given time. Vehicle manufacturers Toyota made a number of LPG-only engines in their 1970s M, R, and Y engine families. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) also offer bi-fuel models; however, the vehicles use a different system from that of their donor vehicles from Holden, with HSV using technology from Orbital Autogas Systems, which injects the autogas into the engine as a liquid instead of a gas for increased efficiency. Since 2011, Holden's Commodore range (sedan, wagon and ute) has been offered as a dedicated LPG vehicle, with an aluminium fuel tank in place of the petrol tank. Petrol engined cars, trucks and buses which have not been fitted with LPG/autogas systems by the manufacturers can usually accept third party systems to enable them to use either LPG or petrol. ROUSH CleanTech manufactures designs, engineers, manufactures and installs propane autogas fuel systems for medium-duty Ford commercial vehicles and Type A and Type C Blue Bird school buses. Vialle manufacture OEM LPG powered scooters and LPG powered mopeds that run equally well on LPG. Ford Australia have offered an LPG-only variant of their Falcon model since 2000.

Countries 2008 Global Autogas Consumption graph. Autogas enjoys great popularity in numerous countries and territories, including: Australia, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, the Republic of Macedonia, South Korea, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Turkey. It is also available at larger petrol stations in several countries. In the Republic of Armenia, for example, the transport ministry estimates as many as 20 to 30% of vehicles use autogas, because it offers a very cheap alternative to both diesel and petrol, being less than half the price of petrol and some 40% cheaper than diesel. The recent rises in oil-derived fuel prices has significantly increased the difference. =Algeria= Since the 1980s, the Algerian government has pursued a policy to promote the use of autogas in Algeria. The two main incentives for the government to put this policy into action were to take advantage of the large LPG production and to reduce urban pollution. At the end of 2003, there were approximately 120,000 autogas- powered vehicles on the roads, supported by over 300 refuelling stations, accounting for 14% of the national vehicle fuel network. The Algerian government fixes the prices of all automotive fuels. Autogas is priced in Algeria at 61% of the price of diesel, making it an affordable option. =Australia= LPG was popular in Australia, because it was less than half the price of petrol in urban areas (approx -0.75 per litre, as opposed to -1.35 per litre for unleaded fuel and -1.30 per litre for diesel, as of February 2010), and it is locally produced. The popularity of automotive LPG is declining, as more motorists purchase hybrid-electric cars, local car manufacturing that offered LPG as a factory option ceasing, and a federal government excise on LPG that commenced in 2011 making the fuel more expensive. The two major local manufacturers, (Ford and Holden), when they used to manufacture cars in Australia (they ceased in 2016 and 2017 respectively), used to offer factory fitted autogas in some models of their locally made large cars and commercial vehicles. Mitsubishi Australia formerly manufactured factory-fitted autogas vehicles locally but ceased manufacturing in 2008. All factory autogas vehicles, with the exception of the E-Gas Ford Falcon model, were bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they have the capability to run on either petrol, autogas, or a combination. Holden Special Vehicles offered a different autogas system from its parent, Holden, that injects the autogas into the engine as a liquid, making for efficiency. All Ford LPG vehicles that were locally made used liquid injected LPG and developed 3 kW more than the petrol equivalent. There are approximately 310,000 autogas-powered cars on Australia's roads. The number of LPG/Dual fuel vehicles continues to decrease, falling by 34.2 per cent (161,191) since 2013. Over the same period, the number of registered electric vehicles has increased by 159.2 per cent to 8,334. There is a corresponding reduction of the number of LPG refuelling locations ‚Äì less than 2,900 today, down from 3,500 several years ago. Whilst historically autogas was excise-free, it began being imposed on all vehicle fuels that were not previously subject to excise in 2011 and was added incrementally up to 2015. The excise on autogas started at 2.5 cents per litre in 2011 and reached 12.5 cents per litre in 2015. By comparison, the excise on petrol will remain at its existing 38 cents per litre. The additional excise on autogas is being offset somewhat by a subsidy that was implemented in 2006 for private motorists, paying either to convert their existing vehicle to autogas, or for purchasing a new vehicle that was manufactured to operate on autogas. The subsidy does not apply to business vehicles or vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of over 3500 kilograms. In addition to the subsidy provided by the Australian federal government, the Western Australian government also provides a subsidy under the long-running LPG subsidy scheme. =Belgium= The use of autogas (called LPG in both French and Dutch speaking Belgium) was once very popular in Belgium, thanks to the subsidies given by the government to install conversion kits. Since, 2003, when the subsidies disappeared, the number of cars running on LPG has decreased and the number of cars running on diesel has increased. This was partly due to the tax incentives to purchase diesel cars. In recent years, the use of autogas as a vehicle fuel has accounted for less than 2% of vehicle fuel use in Belgium. At the end of 2003, there was an estimate of 93,000 autogas-powered vehicles on Belgium, supported by 600 refuelling stations. In 2010 there were 33,482 cars equipped with LPG and in 2012 it went down to 22,265. Since 2012 there has been a slight increase in the number of autogas-powered vehicles of around 14%. This increase is mainly due to the phasing-out of the tax incentives to buy diesel cars. The number of refuelling stations equipped with LPG has increased and in 2012 there were 727 stations. In Belgium, autogas is totally free of excises, but not of VAT. , the price of a litre of autogas is around a third of the price of a litre of diesel, making it the cheapest car fuel available in Belgium. This is a strong incentive for cross-border LPG refuelling traffic with neighbouring countries, especially with France, where LPG is much more expensive. To compensate for the loss of tax revenue, Belgian cars equipped with LPG pay a higher road tax than petrol or compressed natural gas (CNG) cars. In a Government's effort to incentivate the use of LPG cars, the registration tax paid by LPG cars is lower than the registration tax of CNG, petrol and diesel cars because. Thus since 2013, brand-new LPG cars (and LPG cars with less than one year of age) benefit from an important reduction in registration duty. Despite the fact that autogas is excise free in Belgium, it is the cheapest car fuel in Belgium and that it enjoys an important reduction in registration duty, autogas has never reached again the levels of use that it once had in the 1990s. Belgium does not provide with subsidies for LPG or CNG car installations. The current subsidies provided to CNG car installations since 2014 are provided by the natural gas private industry. Since 2013, OPEL is the only distributor that still sells brand-new factory-installed LPG cars in Belgium. =Bulgaria= Autogas consumption in Bulgaria accounted for 14% the total fuel consumption in 2003, an amount which has tripled since 1999. By the end of 2003, there were an estimated 195,000 autogas-powered vehicles on the road, with around 1,500 refuelling stations. Autogas is also very popular with commercial users in Bulgaria, as 90% of minibuses and taxicabs were able to run on the fuel. Vehicles originally manufactured to operate on autogas are virtually non-existent in Bulgaria, so the vast majority of the vehicles are third-party conversions. =Canada= Autogas, or auto propane as it is more commonly referred to in Canada, is the most popular alternative fuel in the country. It is primarily used by high consumption public and private fleets (taxis, couriers, school buses and transit vehicles). Canadian auto propane demand began to increase dramatically in the 1980s after the Government of Canada introduced a grant in 1981 for consumers to convert their vehicles to run on propane in response to national energy security concerns. Some provinces also offered various grants and incentives for propane conversions. Vehicle conversions reached approximately 200,000 in the early 1990s, and auto propane was estimated to be available at over 5,000 locations. The Federal Government grant was discontinued in 1985. Auto propane demand began to decline in the early 1990s due to changes in technology and relatively low cost of gasoline and diesel fuel. An increase in demand has occurred since 2010, as a result of lower prices relative to gasoline and diesel fuel and improved technology. In 2014, it is estimated that the number of auto propane vehicles on the road in Canada is between 25,000 ‚Äì 50,000 and the number of fuelling stations is 2,000. In 2014, auto propane amounted to 7% of the total domestic propane consumption in Canada.Canadian Propane Market Review, GPMi, October 2014 Auto propane is desirable for fleets due to the fact that in many cities in Canada it costs about 40% less than gasoline and diesel. Auto propane also enjoys favourable fuel tax status and is exempt from the federal excise tax and is taxed at a lower rate than gasoline and diesel in every province and territory. Average auto propane prices are reported by Natural Resources Canada. The only OEM vehicle available for purchase in Canada is the Blue Bird Corporation Propane-Powered Vision. Others are pending. Aftermarket conversions represent the balance of the market. These conversions are typically performed on gasoline vehicles and may be either mono fuel (propane only) or dual fuel (operate on propane or gasoline). These conversions are performed in accordance to provincial and territorial regulations and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) B149.5 ‚Äì Installation code for propane fuel systems and tanks on highway vehicles. Another propane option gaining some popularity is diesel blend where propane is blended into the diesel fuel as it is injected into the combustion chamber. This reduces diesel consumption and improves emissions. The cost to convert a vehicle to propane in Canada is approximately to for the current vapour or liquid fuel injected technology, and fleet users can expect a payback on the conversion cost within a year. Converting a vehicle to propane is approximately half the cost of converting a vehicle to natural gas in Canada. In just about every case, a propane dispensing facility will cost significantly less money than any other fuel, including gasoline or diesel. Installing a propane fuelling station will typically cost up to 95% less than a natural gas fuelling station. A typical 2,000 USWG dispenser will cost approximately and a larger high volume dispenser with a 5,000 USWG tank will cost to , not including site costs. =China= Autogas consumption in China has grown rapidly since the 1990s, has slowed down in the early 2000s, but has started to grow again in recent years. In 2009, autogas refuelling stations have spread to 25 cities and has become a major alternative fuel in China. Motorcycles account for a large portion of the autogas, with over 260,000 autogas motorcycles in Shanghai alone. In Shenyang, the local government is encouraging public transport to convert to autogas, and as of 2009 over 160,000 taxicabs run on the fuel as well as over 2,500 buses. The city of Guangzhou accounted for 46.56% of national autogas consumption in 2009. Only 24% of China's Liquefied Petroleum Gas is produced domestically. =Croatia= As of 2008, approximately 30,000 Croatians drove using autogas, which at the time was available from 90 stations throughout the nation. In 2009, it was estimated that there were 60,000 autogas-powered cars on Croatia's roads, and in 2010, it is estimated that 150,000 drivers in Croatia were using autogas. This recent increase in popularity has largely been attributed to the lower price of autogas compared to petrol or diesel. In 2009, Croatia exported 51% of domestically produced liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), leaving only 49% for consumption. Out of that 49%, 45% of domestically sold LPG is used as autogas. Damir Stambuk from the Croatian Ministry of Economy, which is also responsible for energy, said that Croatia is not yet ready for a regular autogas market due to a small network of stations, but in the future it will be. =Czech Republic= At the end of 2003, the roads of the Czech Republic had an estimated 145,000 autogas vehicles with 350 refuelling stations. =Denmark= Autogas has become uncommon in Denmark since taxes have risen, making LPG more expensive than unleaded petrol. As a result, there is no customer demand, leaving only around 13 refuelling stations. The stations are run by Shell, YX, OK, Uno-X, Q8 and Statoil. =France= It was estimated that France would have over 62,500 autogas vehicles on the road by the end of 2010. By the end of 2003, there were an estimated 190,000 autogas vehicles in use with almost 1,900 refuelling stations. In 2005, autogas accounted for around 0.4% of the total automotive fuel use. =Germany= Unmanned LPG-only station in Germany, payment per girocard In Germany, the fuel is called Autogas as well (CNG is known as Erdgas). There were 6,700 fuel stations selling autogas in 2014, supplying about 500,000 registered gas-fueled cars (1.1 percent of all cars in Germany). mylpg.eu lists 7.240 stations in 2016. In addition to filling stations, numerous suppliers of industrial gas run dedicated autogas stations on their premises. Most filling pumps use the ACME adapter but DISH can also be found. Special fuel tax rates make autogas rather cheap in Germany (about 0,52 ‚Ç¨ per litre while 95-octane unleaded is 1,40 ‚Ç¨ per litre). =Greece= LPG or autogas, despite having existed for about three decades in Greece (initially used only in taxis, in 1999 it was legalized for all vehicles), has become popular in the last three to five years, mostly due to the increase in petrol prices. The number of refuelling points as well as conversion workshops is rapidly increasing. Currently (2012) there are about 404 filling stations. Some companies (e.g., Fiat, Toyota, Subaru, Opel, Chevrolet) offer some models with bi-fuel capability. The price at the end of 2012 was about 55% of the price of petrol. The most common term used for it is ygraerio, meaning \\"liquid gas\\". =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, all taxicabs rely on autogas. Many public light buses also rely on autogas. =Ireland= Autogas was very popular in Ireland during the early 1980s, and the country had a large and extensive network of refueling points. It proved popular at the time particularly as Ireland was in a deep recession for much of the 1980s. However autogas fell out of favor in the late 1990s and 2000s due to unreliable early autogas systems and as the country experienced massive economic growth and unprecedented wealth demand for conversions and autogas subsequently dwindled. However, as Ireland once again entered economic recession, austerity measures and increased fuel taxation saw the price of traditional Diesel and petrol fuels skyrocket to record highs. This has seen a small revival of autogas in Ireland in 2012 with new conversion outlets and refueling points opening again. It has been re-introduced to Ireland by the new Polish diaspora living in the country drawing upon their knowledge and expertise from Europe's biggest autogas market. There is a much larger market for Autogas in Northern Ireland, due to UK Government supports. There are currently 86 LPG outlets on the island of Ireland with 45 in Northern Ireland and 41 in the Republic of Ireland. =Italy= Autogas is very popular in Italy. With over 1,000,000 autogas vehicles on the road, it is the second largest autogas market in the European Union, after Poland. Italy was one of the first countries in the world to introduce autogas, which happened in the 1950s. In the first half of 2010 alone, more than 170,000 new autogas cars were registered. General Motors has been especially successful in Italy, with two-thirds of the vehicles sold in 2008 being autogas-capable. Self fill is not permitted in Italy. =Japan= An autogas-powered forklift in Japan. As of 2013, Japan has about 280,000 autogas vehicles on the road, which is less than in recent years. However, the number of autogas vehicles on Japan's roads has been very unstable. The first autogas taxicabs were introduced in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. With a sharp decline in the 1990s, the number started to rise again in 2003. Between 2004 and 2010, the number dropped. The vast majority of autogas vehicles on Japanese roads are taxicabs or commercial vehicles. This is why, in 2010, the Japan LP Gas Association started an initiative to encourage corporations and motorists alike to switch to autogas vehicles. The initiative involves 27,000 Japanese retailers to introduce an autogas vehicle into their fleet every three years. Many of these corporations already have autogas vehicles, but Makoto Arahata from the Japanese LP Gas Association says that there is still much room for improvement. =Lithuania= Lithuania is one the countries with the highest rates of autogas use in Europe. Autogas is very popular in Lithuania and it is widely available. The distribution of most car brands are in the hands of the Polish distributors, therefore factory- installed LPG in brand-new cars are as common and widely available as they are in Poland. =Malta= Autogas was introduced to Malta on 22 May 2012 by Liquigas. The first filling station is located at the Malta International Airport. =Netherlands= Dutch bus on LPG. Note the white gas tanks on the roof of the bus. Use of autogas has varied in the Netherlands. It went up in the 1980s and has decreased ever since, except for an increase in 2005. In 2010, there are around 220,000 autogas vehicles on the road (total cars being a little less than 8 million). Autogas is sold at most fuel stations, stations in urban areas may not supply it due to safety regulations with regard to LPG storage tanks. The 'Dutch Bayonet' is the standard filling device used. The road tax on autogas vehicles can be up to 2 times that of petrol powered vehicles. On the modern third generation (G3) autogas systems, the difference on tax is zero for cars up to 850 kg, but increases for heavier cars. The diesel tax is twice the petrol tax. Because the price of autogas is less than half that of petrol, fitting a car with an LPG system is only economically feasible at more than around 10,000 km/year. =New Zealand= LPG has modest popularity in New Zealand among road users, and reached its peak during the period immediately following the oil crises of the 1970s. As part of his Think Big policies to encourage energy self-sufficiency, Rob Muldoon heavily subsidised the construction of LPG infrastructure during the late 1970s and early 1980s. =Pakistan= LPG was allowed to be used as an automotive fuel in 2005 and first Autogas station became operative in 2010 located at Sialkot. Up until 2014 there were only four Autogas stations operating in Pakistan serving around 1000 vehicles. LPG failed to attract attention of the investors and customers due to extremely cheap prices of CNG as Pakistan had huge Natural Gas reserves. Pakistan in a decade became the largest consumer of CNG. This impacted Pakistan's reserves in a negative way and they receded in a quick span. In November 2013 Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority issued about 40 NoC's for setting up LPG Autogas stations mainly to PSO, a State owned Petroleum giant. However, in December 2013 Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) contrary to the rest of the world where LPG is promoted, declared LPG a risk to public safety thus banned LPG to be used in Public transport vehicles, thus closing the era of LPG in Pakistan even before it started. =Poland= Polish road sign indicating an Autogas station. Poland has one of the oldest and most successful autogas markets in Europe. It is the country with the highest rate of LPG use per capita, higher even than Italy. In 2011, there were 6050 autogas refuelling stations and 2,500,000 autogas vehicles on the road. The number of autogas vehicles in Poland increased by 8% in 2011, however autogas sales decreased by 3.7%. This is mostly due to older vehicles being replaced with newer, more fuel efficient ones. Almost half of Poland's LPG comes from Russia. Most of the Polish distributors offer brand-new factory installed LPG cars of mostly all brands. =Russian Federation= LNG-station in Kazan A GAZelle powered by propane. The Russian word \\"–ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–Ω\\" means propane. Autogas is widely used in Russia. In its modern form it has been used since the 1970s. There are two types of autogas equipment and autogas stations as well. These are LPG (propane-butane mix) and compressed natural gas (CNG, methane). Natural gas is stored at a higher pressure than LPG (200 bar vs. 10 bar for LPG). The main consumer of LPG is commercial transport. CNG is losing its position to LPG and is now rarely seen on public transport buses.. There are some community supported sources where people post gas station locations on the map. These sources may be used by some travelers going to Russia by car. First limited series of vehicles driven by multi-fuel including methane has appeared in the middle of the 20th century. , the number of autogas vehicles in Russia is actively growing. Some are built in the factory to use autogas and some are retrofitted existing vehicles. The average cost of a litre of petrol and diesel fuel in Russia is about per litre. The cost of a litre of LPG is from to , while fuel consumption is almost the same. There are a number of incentives also provided for owners to convert their cars to use autogas. There is also a huge disparity in the rate of development of methane and propane gas stations. The owners of gas vehicles themselves are very fond of their cars for the low cost of operation, but often complain about the inconvenience of placing cylinders in the cabin, as well as the fact that if for example the old \\"Volga\\" costs about 30,000 rubles, then its gasification can cost twice as much. But gasification of new cars as already mentioned in the article is possible directly from the factory =Serbia= Serbia has a well-developed autogas market. Many petrol-powered vehicles from the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, both locally made cars such as Yugos and imports from Western Europe, have been converted to LPG. Autogas systems used in Serbia are mostly from Italian companies like Lovato and Tartarini. As of August 2014, LPG is approximately 40% cheaper per litre than petrol. It is available at petrol stations in the cities and along major routes, as well as some dedicated stations. =Spain= Autogas (called GLP in Spain) was restricted by law to taxis and public transport buses for many decades. In recent years the market has been liberalised and autogas has been made available to all kinds of vehicles. The Spanish government subsidises the installations of autogas in cars and the purchase of brand-new factory-installed autogas cars. There are many factory-installed autogas brand-new cars available for purchase. While the number of autogas-powered cars is increasing every year, it is still low. The main barrier for a major expansion of the number of autogas-powered cars is that the number of refuelling stations for autogas is also still low, but it is increasing quickly too. By the end of 2015 there were 342 stations selling autogas in Spain. Spain is currently the only country using the new EU-wide common standard connector for autogas, the Euroconnector or Euronozzle adapter. The Euronozzle adapter was supposed to replace the current three different LPG filling systems (ACME, Bajonet and Dish) in Europe, but that would be expensive, so investments in such a change- over have not started yet. Before Euronozzle, Spain used a form of Bajonet. Spain's neighbouring countries France and Portugal continue to use Dish adapters for filling vehicles up with LPG. =Thailand= Thailand has for over 15 years run LPG taxi cabs in Bangkok, though autos and buses had erroneously labelled NGV stickers when in fact, they were LPG. A low cost local modification industry had sprung up in Thailand, with costs of conversion as low as , as well as strong local knowhow to avoid its major safety issues. By 2008, half of all taxicabs had switched from gasoline to LPG by low cost local modification. Despite a government push, the number of LPG vehicles continues to grow and outpace NGVs. The number of autogas vehicles has continues to see high growth, despite a push for operators to switch to NGV (CNG), there has been considerable resistance due to inherent costs. As of January 2013, Thailand has 1,014,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and consumed 606,000 tonnes in 2012 of LPG, while 483 stations serve some 380,000 CNG vehicles. =Turkey= Turkey has the highest percentage of autogas vehicles in the world. Some 37% of passenger cars run on autogas, and autogas consumption now exceeds petrol consumption. The Turkish government regulated the autogas price to provide consumers with a net economic advantage of 20‚Äì35%. As of the end of 2010, there are 8,500 autogas fueling stations around the country and market growth has been supported by a network of 1,000 licensed conversion shops. According to the Turkish Statistics Institute's report, the nation had over 16,500,000 vehicles in January 2012. 50.3% are passenger vehicles. 16.2% light weight trucks, 15.7% motorcycles, 9.2% tractors, 4.6% heavy weight trucks, 2.5% mini buses for transportation, 1.4% buses and 0.1% special purpose vehicles. Currently, average 50,000 new generation cars are sold per month. LPG is dominantly used in Turkey as an autogas while there are only around 500 CNG fueled cars and there are only two CNG filling stations. In Turkey, Diesel vehicles are usually not converted to LPG because of unsuccessful applications in the past. For that reason, installations are often not made to light and heavy weight trucks, tractors, bus and mini-buses and motorcycles, because the owners of conversion workshops are fearful of the risks. 8.3 million LPG cars are passenger vehicles. 33% of the passenger cars (2,739,000) are diesel powered and 67% are petrol powered (5,561,000). As there is no conversion to diesel cars, among 5,561,000 petrol powered passenger cars, According to the reports of the MMO, (Chamber of Mechanical Engineers, authorized to check emissions and licenses) there were 3.1 million LPG fueled vehicles by the end of the year 2011. This means more than 55% of petrol powered passenger vehicles are already converted to LPG. The converted vehicles were mostly carburated engines. Nearly 90% of the old carburated engines have already been converted and day by day, new generation vehicle owners are also choosing LPG as an alternative fuel. The reason of this high LPG application is because of the Turkish government's application of high taxes upon petrol and diesel prices, and because of these taxes, Turkey finds itself using the second most expensive petrol in the world (after Norway) even though Turkey has borders with OPEC countries exporting crude oil and petroleum to the world and has the lowest transportation costs. Turkish people found the only solution to save money from their road expenses by converting their cars to autogas which gives them an advantage of 35% to 40% savings. This big conversion is the success of Turkish autogas kits and autogas tanks manufacturers starting from 1995, even though autogas use became legal in 2000. At the same time, Italian companies also supplied systems through several companies. =Ukraine= Ukraine has a well-developed autogas market. Many petrol-powered vehicles from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, both locally made cars such as ZAZ and imports from Western Europe, have been converted to LPG. One may also buy a factory-prepared LPG car. As of August 2017, LPG is approximately 2 times cheaper per litre than petrol. It is widely available at petrol stations in the cities and along major routes, as well as some dedicated stations. =United Kingdom= According to the LPG trade association in the UK there are about 1500 refuelling stations that cater for the 160,000 LPG powered vehicles on UK roads. This represents less than 1% of vehicles. The only Government incentive to use LPG is the lower road fuel tax applied to LPG compared to petrol. As of January 2012, the saving of about 60 pence per litre is the highest it has ever been and that combined with conversion prices being an historic low should result in an increase in LPG conversions. Technology has reached the point where almost all conversions are 'Sequential Vapour Injection', and in the UK there is a large number of kits with various price and quality ranges to choose from, resulting in a very competitive market. =United States= Propane-powered Ford van in Wayne, Michigan Autogas is on the rise in the United States. As of February 2012, the United States has more than 147,000 autogas vehicles on the road, accounting for just 2% of the world's total and as of June 2013, the United States has 2,843 autogas fueling stations, making it easier for drivers to refuel across the country. The U.S. Department of Energy has a website that autogas drivers can easily locate autogas fueling stations near them as well as other alternative fuels. The cost of converting a car to use petrol or autogas at a turn of a knob starts from . Autogas use by car drivers can help the United States to reduce dependence on foreign oil as 90% of all U.S. Autogas is produced in the U.S. In 2005, a provision was enacted that placed a 50-cent per gallon tax credit on propane autogas as part of H.R. 4853, making it $1 per gallon cheaper than petrol on average. The alternative fuel credit was extended in 2010 and remained in effect until the end of 2011. Autogas for America claims to be the unified voice of the autogas industry in the United States. Composed of autogas experts, transportation industry specialists and environmental advocates, Autogas for America says it \\"leverages industry cooperation to widen recognition of autogas among the US public, media and government.\\" The Alternative Fuel Association of America based in New York is the largest association of its kind; it give incentives of up to $4,000 to the owners of fleets who retrofit their vehicle to autogas; the Association works closely with CNG and LPG Max of America, one of the pioneer companies in the LPG and CNG conversions in America. Piston-powered small aircraft that use autogas require a Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. System types Vialle LPI liquid injection on a 2003 Lexus IS 300 2JZ-GE. The different autogas systems generally use the same type of filler, tanks, lines and fittings but use different components in the engine bay. Liquid injection systems use special tanks with circulation pumps and return lines similar to petrol fuel injection systems. There are three basic types of autogas system. The oldest of these is the conventional converter-and-mixer system, which has existed since the 1940s and is still widely used today. The other two types are known as injection systems, but there are significant differences between the two. A converter-mixer system uses a converter to change liquid fuel from the tank into vapour, then feeds that vapour to the mixer where it is mixed with the intake air. This is also known as a venturi system or \\"single point\\" system. Vapour phase injection systems also use a converter, but unlike the mixer system, the gas exits the converter at a regulated pressure. The gas is then injected into the air intake manifold via a series of electrically controlled injectors. The injector opening times are controlled by the autogas control unit. This unit works in much the same way as a petrol fuel injection control unit. This allows much more accurate metering of fuel to the engine than is possible with mixers, improving economy and/or power while reducing emissions. Liquid phase injection systems do not use a converter, but instead deliver the liquid fuel into a fuel rail in much the same manner as a petrol injection system. These systems are still very much in their infancy. Because the fuel vaporises in the intake, the air around it is cooled significantly. This increases the density of the intake air and can potentially lead to substantial increases in engine power output, to the extent that such systems are usually de-tuned to avoid damaging other parts of the engine. Liquid phase injection has the potential to achieve much better economy and power plus lower emission levels than are possible using mixers or vapour phase injectors. System components Fuel filler in E-Gas Ford Falcon Filler with mounting and cover removed =Filler= The fuel is transferred into a vehicle tank as liquid by connecting the bowser at the filling station to the filler fitting on the vehicle. The type of filler used varies from country to country, and in some cases different types are used within the same country. The four types are: # ACME thread. This type has a threaded fitting onto which the bowser nozzle is screwed before the trigger is pulled to establish a seal before fuel transfer. This type is used in Australia, US, Germany, Belgium, Republic of Ireland. Some LPG filling stations in the United Kingdom also use ACME. # 'Dutch' bayonet.DriveLPG.co.uk has instruction how to use 2 types of bayonet filler guns for refuelling with LPG (PDF-file) This type establishes a gas-proof seal by a push and twist action. This type is used in the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Switzerland. Some LPG filling stations in Norway also use bayonet. Spain was using a longer version of bayonet when LPG was still for taxis only, but has switched to Euronozzle when LPG sales were made available to the general public. # 'Italian' dish. This type is used in Italy, France, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Sweden. # Euronozzle. This new type of adaptor was developed to minimize or eliminate the small amount of gas that escapes when disconnecting the filler hose from the vehicle. The Euronozzle is (or was) supposed to become a unified new filling system for the entire European continent, but investments in such a change-over have failed to start. As of 2018 Spain remains the only country in Europe that has adopted the Euronozzle adaptor, a decision that was made when Spain had to redevelop a filling station network for LPG from practically zero. Adaptors that allow a vehicle fitted with a particular system to refuel at a station equipped with another system are available. The fill valve contains a check valve so that the liquid in the line between the filler and the tank(s) does not escape when the bowser nozzle is disconnected. In installations where more than one tank is fitted, T-fittings may be used to connect the tanks to one filler so that the tanks are filled simultaneously. In some applications, more than one filler may be fitted, such as on opposite sides of the vehicle. These may be connected to separate tanks, or may be connected to the same tanks using T-fittings in the same manner as for connecting multiple tanks to one filler. Fillers are typically made of brass to avoid the possibility of sparks when attaching or removing the bowser that might occur if steel fittings were used. =Hoses, pipes and fittings= Gas lines and fittings. Containment hose, liquid hose, copper pipe with flared end plus brass elbows and T fitting The hose between the filler and tank(s) is called the fill hose or fill line. The hose or pipe between the tank(s) and the converter is called the service line. These both carry liquid under pressure. The flexible hose between the converter and mixer is called the vapour hose or vapour line. This line carries vapour at low pressure and has a much larger diameter to suit. Where the tank valves are located inside an enclosed space such as the boot of a sedan, a plastic containment hose is used to provide a gas-tight seal between the gas components and the inside of the vehicle. Liquid hoses for LPG are specifically designed and rated for the pressures that exist in LPG systems, and are made from materials designed to be compatible with the fuel. Some hoses are made with crimped fittings, while others are made using re-usable fittings that are pressed or screwed onto the end of the hose. Rigid sections of liquid line are usually made using copper tubing, although in some applications, steel pipes are used instead. The ends of the pipes are always double-flared and fitted with flare nuts to secure them to the fittings. Liquid line fittings are mostly made from brass. The fittings typically adapt from a thread in a component, such as a BSP or NPT threaded hole on a tank, to an SAE flare fitting to suit the ends of pipes or hoses. =Tank= Autogas tank in boot of Volvo sedan Tank valves. From left, relief valve (with red cap), service valve, gauge and fill valve Autogas tank inside spare wheel recess :'''' Vehicles are often fitted with only one tank, but multiple tanks are used in a some applications. In passenger car applications, the tank is typically either a cylindrical tank, made from steel, mounted in the boot of the vehicle or a toroidal tank (also steel) or set of permanently interconnected cylinders placed in the spare wheel well. In commercial vehicle applications, the tanks are generally cylindrical tanks mounted either in the cargo space or on the chassis underneath the body. Increasingly, the tank is an aluminium Conformable Tank, which is lighter, has more capacity and cannot rust. The tanks have fittings for filling, liquid outlet, emergency relief of excess pressure, fuel level gauge and sometimes a vapour outlet. These may be separate valves mounted into a series of 3 to 5 holes in a plate welded into the tank shell, or may be assembled onto a multi-valve unit which is bolted into one large hole on a boss welded, or in the case of an aluminium tank, extruded as part of the tank shell. Fill valve and AFL Modern fill valves are usually fitted with an automatic fill limiter (AFL) to prevent overfilling. The AFL has a float arm which restricts the flow significantly but does not shut it off entirely. This is intended to cause the pressure in the line to rise enough to tell the bowser to stop pumping but not cause dangerously high pressures. Before AFLs were introduced, it was common for the filler (with integral check valve) to be screwed directly into the tank, as the operator had to open an ullage valve at the tank while filling, allowing vapour out of the top of the tank and stopping filling when liquid started coming out of the ullage valve to indicate that the tank was full. Modern tanks are not fitted with ullage valves. The liquid outlet is usually used to supply fuel to the engine, and is usually referred to as the service valve. Modern service valves incorporate an electric shut-off solenoid. In applications using very small engines such as small generators, vapour may be withdrawn from the top of the tank instead of liquid from the bottom of the tank. The emergency pressure relief valve in the tank is called a hydrostatic pressure relief valve. It is designed to open if the pressure in the tank is dangerously high, thus releasing some vapour to the atmosphere to reduce the pressure in the tank. The release of a small quantity of vapour reduces the pressure in the tank, which causes some of the liquid in the tank to vaporise to re-establish equilibrium between liquid and vapour. The latent heat of vaporisation causes the tank to cool, which reduces pressure even further. The gauge sender is usually a magnetically coupled arrangement, with a float arm inside the tank rotating a magnet, which rotates an external gauge. The external gauge is usually readable directly, and most also incorporate an electronic sender to operate a fuel gauge on the dashboard. =Valves= There are a number of types of valve used in autogas systems. The most common ones are shut-off or filter-lock valves, which are used to stop flow in the service line. These may be operated by vacuum or electricity. On bi-fuel systems with a petrol carburettor, a similar shut-off valve is usually fitted in the petrol line between the pump and carburettor. Check valves are fitted in the filler and on the fill input to the fuel tank to prevent fuel flowing back the wrong way. Service valves are fitted to the outlet from the tank to the service line. These have a tap to turn the fuel on and off. The tap is usually only closed when the tank is being worked on. In some countries, an electrical shut-off valve is built into the service valve. Two Sherwood valves. 1995 on left, 1989 on right Where multiple tanks are fitted, a combination of check valves and a hydrostatic relief valve are usually installed to prevent fuel from flowing from one tank to another. In Australia, there is a common assembly designed for this purpose. It is a combined twin check valve and hydrostatic relief valve assembly built in the form of a T-fitting, such that the lines from the tanks come into the sides of the valve and the outlet to the converter comes out the end. Because there is only one common brand of these valves, they are known colloquially as a Sherwood valve. =Converter= The converter (also known as vaporiser or reducer) is a device designed to change the fuel from a pressurised liquid to a vapour at around atmospheric pressure for delivery to the mixer or vapour phase injectors. Because of the refrigerant characteristic of the fuel, heat must be put into the fuel by the converter. This is usually achieved by having engine coolant circulated through a heat exchanger that transfers heat from that coolant to the LPG. There are two distinctly different basic types of converter for use with mixer type systems. The European style of converter is a more complex device that incorporates an idle circuit and is designed to be used with a simple fixed venturi mixer. The American style of converter is a simpler design which is intended to be used with a variable venturi mixer that incorporates an idle circuit. Engines with a low power output such as; scooters, quad bikes and generators can use a simpler type of converter (also known as governor or regulator). These converters are fed with fuel in vapour form. Evaporation takes place in the tank where refrigeration occurs as the liquid fuel boils. The tanks large surface area exposed to the ambient air temperature combined with the low power output (fuel requirement) of the engine make this type of system viable. The refrigeration of the fuel tank is proportional to fuel demand hence this arrangement is only used on smaller engines. This type of converter can either be fed with vapour at tank pressure (called a 2-stage regulator) or be fed via a tank mounted regulator at a fixed reduced pressure (called a single stage regulator). OHG X-450 mixer showing air valve open to full load position =Mixer= The mixer is the device that mixes the fuel into the air flowing to the engine. The mixer incorporates a venturi designed to draw the fuel into the airflow due to the movement of the air. Mixer type systems have existed since the 1940s and some designs have changed little over that time. Mixers are now being increasingly superseded by injectors. =Vapour phase injectors= Most vapour phase injection systems mount the solenoids in a manifold block or injector rail, then run hoses to the nozzles, which are screwed into holes drilled and tapped into the runners of the intake manifold. There is usually one nozzle for each cylinder. Some vapour injection systems resemble petrol injection, having separate injectors that fit into the manifold or head in the same manner as petrol injectors, and are fed fuel through a fuel rail. Vapour phase injectors =Liquid phase injectors= Liquid phase injectors are mounted onto the engine in a manner similar to petrol injectors, being mounted directly at the inlet manifold and fed liquid fuel from a fuel rail. =Electrical and electronic controls= There are four distinct electrical systems that may be used in autogas systems ‚Äì fuel gauge sender, fuel shut-off, closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control. In some installations, the fuel gauge sender fitted to the autogas tank is matched to the original fuel gauge in the vehicle. In others, an additional gauge is added to display the level of fuel in the autogas tank separately from the existing petrol gauge. In most modern installations, an electronic device called a tachometric relay or safety switch is used to operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, there is also a solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay. Closed loop feedback systems use an electronic controller that operates in much the same way as in a petrol fuel injection systems, using an oxygen sensor to effectively measure the air/fuel mixture by measuring the oxygen content of the exhaust and control valve on the converter or in the vapour line to adjust the mixture. Mixer type systems that do not have a closed loop feedback fitted are sometimes referred to as open loop systems. Injection systems use a computerised control system which is very similar to that used in petrol injection systems. In virtually all systems, the injection control system integrates the tachometric relay and closed loop feedback functions. =Optional valve protection= INTEC electronic valve protection system Many LPG equipment installers recommend the installation of so-called valve protection systems. These can consist in the most simple case of a bottle containing valve protection liquid. The liquid is drawn into the air intake system and distributed into the engines' cylinders along with the fuel and air. More sophisticated systems can consist of a piggyback ECU that is synchronised with the LPG injector ECU. This results in a more precise injection of valve protection fluid. Converter-and-mixer system operation The designs of converters and mixers are matched to each other by matching sizes and shapes of components within the two. In most areas of the world the word \\"converter\\" is not commonly used. 'Regulator' or 'reducer' or 'vaporizer' are more popular. Because it has 3 main functions: # Reducer: reduces the high pressure of incoming liquid phase LPG down to atmospheric pressure. # Regulator: regulates the gas flow according to the requirement of the engine. # Vaporizer: vaporizes the liquid form LPG into gas form by using the hot coolant circulation of the engine. In European style systems, the size and shape of the venturi of the carburettor is designed to match the converter. In USA style systems, the air valve and metering pins in the mixer are sized to match the diaphragm size and spring stiffness in the converter. In both cases, the components are matched by the manufacturers and only basic adjustments are needed during installation and tuning. Autogas carburettor consisting of OHG X-450 mixer, adapter and Rochester throttlebody An autogas carburettor may simply consist of a throttlebody and a mixer, sometimes fitted together using an adapter, the venturi is not needed. Cold start enrichment is achieved by the fact that the engine coolant is cold when the engine is cold. This causes denser vapour to be delivered to the mixer. As the engine warms up, the coolant temperature rises until the engine is at operating temperature and the mixture has leaned off to the normal running mixture. Depending on the system, the throttle may need to be held open further when the engine is cold in the same manner as with a petrol carburettor. On others, the normal mixture is intended to be somewhat lean and no cold-start throttle increase is needed. Because of the way enrichment is achieved, no additional choke butterfly is required for cold starting with LPG. Some evaporators have an electric choke valve, energising this valve, before starting the engine, will spray some LPG vapour into the carburetor to help cold start. The temperature of the engine is critical to the tuning of an autogas system. The engine thermostat effectively controls the temperature of the converter, thus directly affecting the mixture. A faulty thermostat, or a thermostat of the wrong temperature range for the design of the system may not operate correctly. The power output capacity of a system is limited by the ability of the converter to deliver a stable flow of vapour. A coolant temperature lower than intended will reduce the maximum power output possible, as will an air bubble trapped in the cooling circuit or complete loss of coolant. All converters have a limit, beyond which mixtures become unstable. Unstable mixtures typically contain tiny droplets of liquid fuel that were not heated enough in the converter and will vaporise in the mixer or intake to form an excessively rich mixture. When this occurs, the mixture will become so rich that the engine will flood and stall. Because the outside of the converter will be at or below 0 ¬∞C when this happens, water vapour from the air will freeze onto the outside of the converter, forming an icy white layer. Some converters are very susceptible to cracking when this happens. LPG injection for diesel vehicles LPG may be used for a supplemental fuel for diesels of all sizes. Diesel contains 128,700 BTU per US gallon, where propane contains 91,690 BTU per US gallon. If LPG is 30‚Äì40% less expensive, there may very well be a saving. Any actual savings are dependent on the relative cost of diesel versus LPG. In Australia, where diesel costs substantially more than LPG, savings of 10 to 20% are claimed. The above systems add small quantities of LPG with the primary aim of improving economy, but much larger quantities of LPG can be injected in order to increase power. Even at full output a diesel engine runs about 50% lean of stoichiometric to avoid black smoke production, so there is a substantial amount of oxygen in the intake charge which is not consumed in the combustion process. This oxygen is therefore available for the combustion of a substantial addition of LPG resulting in a large increase in power output.

Licensed to operate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States, the station is currently owned by pastor Ralph Moore. History James A. Noe obtained the construction permit for 1550, originally WUNE and WYNE, in 1961. In 1963, the station was sold to KCIL, Inc., which built it and gave it the callsign it used when it signed on, WLUX. The station was a 5,000-watt daytimer. In 1971, Capital City Communications, which had bought WLUX in 1967, went bankrupt. The station's license had been filed for renewal in 1970, but the Federal Communications Commission designated it for hearing because of a litany of issues, namely allegations of an unauthorized transfer of control, inaccurate ownership reports and improper operation of the radio station. With the station in receivership, a sale was attempted to United Broadcast Industries, Inc. The FCC denied the renewal of the license and canceled the sale, saying that renewing WLUX's license to operate would allow the owners of Capital City, described as having \\"utter disregard\\" for FCC rules, to benefit. However, WLUX would eventually be spared. Edwin A. LaRose, the receiver, challenged the FCC's denial in appeals court and won, with the appeals court finding that LaRose was acting within his bounds as a receiver and that the FCC committed an \\"abuse of discretion\\" in refusing to consider a license renewal for the station.494 F.2d 1145 161 U.S.App.D.C. 226 LaRose vs. Federal Communications Commission LaRose had found another buyer, a local television preacher named Jimmy Swaggart. The FCC approved the sale of WLUX to Swaggart, and the renewal of the license, on December 18, 1974, noting that Swaggart was not connected in any way with the wrongdoing committed by Capital City that prompted the license revocation. The 1973 license renewal would then be approved in 1977. For the next 18 years, Swaggart owned and operated WLUX. In 1994, Swaggart's ministry built an FM station, WJFM 88.5, and moved his religious programming there. Swaggart then sold the station to Victory & Power Ministries, headed by pastor Ralph Moore. The station primarily broadcasts religious programming from a variety of local Christian ministries.

It was intended to replace the FAI and its field trials were completed in 1935. The BA-20 was then used in the early stages of World War II. Design and production The BA-20 armored car was developed in 1934 for use by HQ staffs, reconnaissance and communications units. It was derived from the civilian GAZ-M1 car using its chassis, which was itself a modified version of a Ford design, produced by the Nizhny Novgorod-based vehicle manufacturer GAZ. Full production of the BA-20 started in 1935. The chassis was built at the Nizhny Novgorod factory; the body was built at the Vyksinskiy plant, where final assembly of the BA-20 occurred as well. Service The principal use of the BA-20 was as a scout vehicle. The BA-20's tires were designed to be resistant to bullets and shrapnel by the simple expedient of filling them with spongey rubber. A variant, the BA-20ZhD, could travel on railway lines by replacing the normal wheels with flanged metal rail-type wheels. The vehicle was exported to the Spanish Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, although the vast majority of BA-20s built served with the Soviet Red Army. They first saw combat in the conflict with Japan in 1939 on the Khalkin Gol river in Mongolia (see Battle of Khalkin Gol). The BA-20 was used by the Red Army in the Soviet invasion of Poland later in 1939 and the Winter War against Finland between 1939‚Äì40 in which Finland captured 18 designating them as PA-6, as well as the early stages of Operation Barbarossa in 1941. Production was ended that same year, with some 4,800 BA-20s having been constructed by that time. Some had flamethrowers instead of the DP-28. Soviet BA-20 armored car in Finnish markings, at the Parola Tank Museum Finland In common with most armored cars derived from cars, the BA-20 was largely roadbound. The lack of all-wheel drive, high ground pressure, and low power prevented it from moving cross- country except on very firm ground. The armor was too thin to stop anything other than fragments or small-arms fire, and the 7.62 mm machinegun was not adequate to penetrate other scout vehicles. The Red Army produced very few wheeled armored fighting vehicles in the war, but replaced the BA-20 with the BA-64B. Mistaken identification The BA-20 is often mistaken for the very similar FAI armoured car. The main recognition feature is the flat roof of the BA-20; the FAI has two dome-shaped covers over the driver's and co-driver's stations. Early BA-20s had the same vertical-sided turret as the FAI. Later models had a conical-shaped turret. Some had flamethrowers instead of the DP-28.

It was released direct-to-video and produced by the independent production company Reeltime Pictures. It is a sequel to the Second Doctor serials The Abominable Snowmen (1967) and The Web of Fear (1968). Downtime stars Nicholas Courtney, Deborah Watling, Jack Watling and Elisabeth Sladen reprising their roles as Brigadier Lethbridge- Stewart, Victoria Waterfield, Professor Edward Travers and Sarah Jane Smith, respectively. It introduces the character of Kate Lethbridge-Stewart. Synopsis Sometime after Victoria had parted company with the Doctor on 20th century Earth (Fury from the Deep), she is lured back to the Detsen Monastery in Tibet (The Abominable Snowmen) by a dream telling her she'll find her late father there. Instead, she finds the Great Intelligence, which still possessed the mind of Professor Travers (The Web of Fear). 15 years later, Victoria is the vice chancellor of New World University. New World is an institution that claims to offer spiritual guidance to distraught youth. In reality, New World is the headquarters for the Intelligence's new plan to conquer the world by infecting all of the computers. Both the administration and students await the coming of a \\"new world\\" that will be heralded by the chancellor, the Intelligence-possessed Travers. Victoria's motives are well- meaning but misguided, having been manipulated with a promised \\"light of truth\\". The students themselves have been brainwashed through their computer courses and are slaves of the Intelligence. Outsiders refer to them as \\"chillys\\". The Intelligence needs a final missing Locus to attain its goal. It believes the Brigadier has it, but the locus (a small wooden carving of a yeti) is actually with his daughter Kate and grandson Gordon on their narrowboat. New World attempts to gather information on the Brigadier by asking Sarah Jane Smith to investigate him. Sarah lies about knowing the Brigadier and later warns both him and UNIT. The Intelligence then arranges a meeting between the Brigadier and a corrupt UNIT captain named Cavendish. Throughout the story the Brigadier is aided by a New World student named Daniel Hinton, a former student of his from the Brendon School. The Intelligence's conditioning failed on Hinton, though at times he is still under its influence and at one point becomes a Yeti. He can communicate with the Brigadier through the bardo or astral plane. Cast * Nicholas Courtney ‚Äì Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The hero of the story, the Brigadier is targeted by the Great Intelligence in revenge for their defeat in the previous story The Web of Fear. Now living by himself, the Brigadier is initially distant from his daughter Kate (and it is implied that he is separated from Doris). At the story's conclusion, Lethbridge-Stewart learns that he is grandfather to Gordon James, his daughter's only child. * Elisabeth Sladen ‚Äì Sarah Jane Smith. A journalist working for Metropolitan Magazine, Sarah-Jane is initially contacted by Victoria Waterfield to provide information on UNIT Personnel, including the Brigadier. Suspicious of their motives, Sarah-Jane attempts to contact the Brigadier and, at the story's conclusion, allies herself with his daughter Kate. * Deborah Watling ‚Äì Victoria Waterfield. A former companion of the Doctor, Victoria feels alone and stranded in the 20th century. Using money that her father has left her, she has built the New World Campus and is, na√Øvely, trying to locate her father using the locus. The Great Intelligence takes advantage of her naivety and her position as Vice- Chancellor but she eventually sees through their deception. At the end of the story, with the Great Intelligence defeated she disappears with no known trace. * Jack Watling ‚Äì Professor Edward Travers. A former adversary of the Great Intelligence who has faced them twice before (in the stories The Abominable Snowmen and The Web of Fear, Travers is now their pawn and seeks freedom through finding the last locus. * Beverley Cressman ‚Äì Kate Lethbridge- Stewart. The only daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, Kate lives with her only son Gordon James ('Gordy') on a houseboat. Unbeknownst to her, she possesses the last remaining locus in a toy chest, which has taken the form of a wooden yeti carving. Kate is initially resentful of her father, blaming his work for the disintegration of their family, although they make their peace at the story's conclusion. * Mark Trotman ‚Äì Daniel Hinton. A former student of the Brigadier's at Brendon School, the rebellious Hinton is initially immune to the influence of the Great Intelligence, although her later comes into contact with one of the yeti control spheres and is transformed into one. A computer hacker, he is friends with the university's DJ Anthony and attempts to warn the Brigadier about the Great Intelligence's plot before he is revealed as the trap designed to capture him. It is implied at the end of the story that Hinton has died and entered the astral plane, through which he communicates with the Brigadier's grandson. * Geoffrey Beevers ‚Äì Harrod Haroldson. A former RAF officer, Flight Sergeant Haroldson is now homeless and has earned the nickname 'Harrod's' because he is fussy about where he sleeps as a vagrant. Harrods is loyal to the Brigadier and attempts to help him mount a defence against the Great Intelligence. * Peter Silverleef ‚Äì Christopher Rice. The marketing manager at New World University, Rice is a pawn of the Great Intelligence and attempts to seize power for himself at the story's conclusion but is destroyed in the crossfire. * John Leeson ‚Äì Anthony. The DJ of New World University, Anthony is antagonistic towards Victoria and Christopher Rice, resentful of having to transmit propaganda; after he attempts to broadcast the truth, he is consumed by the Great Intelligence. * Miles Richardson ‚Äì Captain Douglas Cavendish. A UNIT captain who is, in reality controlled by the Great Intelligence, he attempts to extract information about the final locus from Lethbridge-Stewart. Cavendish survives the conflict and resigns from UNIT, his story is continued in the follow-up drama Daemos Rising. * James Bree ‚Äì Lama. The Lama at the Det-Sen Monastery, he appears at the beginning of the story attempting to warn Victoria away from the Great Intelligence. * Kathy Coutler ‚Äì Receptionist. * Alexander Landen ‚Äì Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart Production notes The initial script read through took place in March 1995, with filming beginning on Friday 24 March in South- West London with the scenes set at the Brigadier's home. The university campus scenes were shot at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. DWB Editor Anthony Brown, who had attended UEA, suggested the location after another had fallen through, as the distinctive Ziggurat-shaped student residences Norfolk and Suffolk Terrace echoed pyramid motifs in the script. UEA students were recruited as 'Chillys' (extras) through the campus newspaper Concrete. Filming at the university was delayed slightly when the fire alarm sounded during the recording of some internal scenes. Production of some external scenes had to be rescheduled thanks to unseasonal spring snow storms ‚Äî ironically, snow was conspicuously absent from the first Yeti story, The Abominable Snowmen. The later Reeltime production D√¶mos Rising followed up on some of the elements of this story, specifically with the characters of Kate Lethbridge-Stewart and Captain Cavendish. Daniel Hinton is named after Craig Hinton, the Doctor Who fan and novelist. Soundtrack release Music from this video composed by Ian Levine, Nigel Stock, and Erwin Keiles was released on CD by Silva Screen Records in December 1995.Downtime ‚Äì Original Soundtrack Recording The 'Monastic chant' heard in the opening and closing themes was the same chant that was used in the Doctor Who story Planet of the Spiders. =Track listing= Novelisation In 1996 a novelisation of Downtime by Marc Platt was published by Virgin Publishing as part of their Missing Adventures line. It expands greatly on the original story and features many differences in plot. It is the only Missing Adventure not to centre on the Doctor, although the Second Doctor makes a cameo at the start of the novel, and the Third Doctor makes a cameo at the end. The novelisation included an 8-page photo insert of behind-the-scenes images taken by photographer Robin Prichard during the film production.  Release  The film was a direct to video VHS release in 1995. Then, in 2015 One Media iP Limited acquired the drama and re-released it as a 2-DVD boxset in November 2015.

The toolkit is created and supported by the Kitware team. VTK supports a various visualization algorithms including: scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as: implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. VTK has an information visualization framework, has a suite of 3D interaction widgets, supports parallel processing, and integrates with various databases and GUI toolkits such as Qt and Tk. VTK is cross-platform and runs on Linux, Windows, Mac and Unix platforms. The core of VTK is implemented as a C++ toolkit, requiring users to build applications by combining various objects into an application. The system also supports automated wrapping of the C++ core into Python, Java and Tcl, so that VTK applications may also be written using these programming languages. History VTK was initially created in 1993 as companion software to the book The Visualization Toolkit: An Object- Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics. The book and software were written by three researchers (Will Schroeder, Ken Martin and Bill Lorensen) on their own time and with permission from General Electric (thus the ownership of the software resided with, and continues to reside with, the authors). After the core of VTK was written, users and developers around the world began to improve and apply the system to real-world problems. With the founding of Kitware, the VTK community grew rapidly, and toolkit usage expanded into academic, research and commercial applications. A number of major companies and organizations, such as Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory funded the development of VTK and even developed a number of VTK modules themselves. VTK forms the core of the 3DSlicer biomedical computing application, and numerous research papers at IEEE Visualization and other conferences based on VTK have appeared. VTK has been used on a large 1024-processor computer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to process nearly a Petabyte of data. Later VTK was expanded to support the ingestion, processing and display of informatics data. This work was supported by Sandia National Laboratories under the 'Titan' project. Criticism In 2013, a survey paper on visualization for radiotherapy noticed that while VTK is a powerful and widely known toolkit, it lacked a number of important features, such as multivolume rendering, had no support of GPGPU libraries such as CUDA, no support of out-of-core rendering of huge datasets and no native support for visualization of time-dependent volumetric data.Miguel Nunes, Matthias Schlachter, Katja Buehler, \\"Visualization Tools for Radiotherapy - a Survey\\", in: Innovative imaging to improve radiotherapy treatments, materials of 2nd summer school by SUMMER Marie Curie Research Training Network, a EU &th; Framework Programme, 2013, Since 2013 there have been improvements such as VTK-m which can speed-up and parallelize certain computationally intensive tasks using accelerators such as GPGPU. VTK is also used in the visualization pipeline of radiological imaging software such as MEDInria or Starviewer which perform multi-volume (also called fusion) and time-dependent (also called phase) visualizations.

She first appears in Doom Patrol Volume 2 #19 (February 1989). According to the afterword in the first trade paperback collection of Morrison's Doom Patrol, she is based on Truddi Chase, whose autobiography, When Rabbit Howls, Morrison was reading while creating the series. Jane makes her first live adaptation and is part of the main cast of the Doom Patrol television series on DC Universe and HBO Max, played by Diane Guerrero. Fictional character biography Jane Morris is the current dominant alternate personality, or \\"host\\", of Kay Challis's \\"system\\" (used to refer to every alter someone has as a collective). Kay Challis, as a result of repeated childhood trauma, developed dissociative identity disorder. Later in life, while being exposed to the alien Dominators' \\"gene bomb\\", each of her alternate personalities, or alters (which, to date, is numbered at 64), has a different super-power. Beginning only at five years old, Kay Challis was continuously abused by her father. The first time this happened, she was putting a jigsaw puzzle together; this would become an important symbol in her future. As the abuse continues, Kay withdraws and goes dormant, retreating to the unconscious brain. Her role as host is then taken over by an alter with the name \\"Miranda\\". One Easter Sunday, while at church, Miranda is raped, which triggers several flashbacks to her former abuse. This causes the dormancy of Miranda and a massive amount of alters being split off. She is committed to a mental institution soon after. During that time, an alien species called Dominators invade Earth and activate a device to which they call their \\"gene bomb\\". When the gene-bomb goes off, Jane and all of her personalities are affected; each personality gains a different power (e.g. Black Annis has retractable claws, Flit can teleport, etc.). The super-hero Cliff Steele, or Robotman, suffered several losses due to this bomb. It killing many of his Doom Patrol team mates, he was struggling emotionally. While he's staying in the same institution as Jane, Dr. Will Magnus, creator of the group \\"Metalmen\\", asks Cliff to look after her, which leads to Jane's becoming a member of Doom Patrol. Near the end of the Grant Morrison run of Doom Patrol, Jane makes a pilgrimage back to her childhood home, facing her own traumas and overcoming them. This brings peace to her inner turmoil, causing her and her alters integrate into one, very complex single personality. Upon returning to Doom Patrol, Jane is attacked by The Candlemaker and thrown into another dimension, which is similar to the real world, where she is diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with shock therapy. Cliff eventually rescues Jane from the other dimension and they relocate on Danny the World, formerly Danny the Street. In Rachel Pollack's run, it is revealed that Jane's alters still exist, which causes many arguments between the two. Cliff decides to leave her with Danny and returns to Earth. Jane makes a cameo appearance in Teen Titans #36, where she is seen on Danny the World through a portal in Dayton Manor in Prague. She returns in Doom Patrol #7, written by Keith Giffen, on Oolong Island, asking for Cliff and carrying with her the remains of Danny the Street. Danny has now been reduced to a single brick, making them Danny the Brick. Jane says \\"If you build it, he will come\\", although she does not explain further.Doom Patrol #8. DC Comics. Jane then travels around the universe along with Danny the Brick. A man named \\"D\\" then uses Danny the Brick to kill a God and causes another alter to split, or \\"break off\\". This alter starts a cult and plans to spread Crazy Jane's alters among the sixty-three cult members and then to kill the cultists. She is stopped by the Doom Patrol, who then return Jane to the front, in order to be the host.Doom Patrol #6. DC Comics. Jane now accepts her mental illness, no longer seeking to cure it, but to cope with it and healthily coexist with her alters. Robotman also helps and accepts her disorder. Alters Crazy Jane's alters are organized in a mental subway grid called \\"the Underground\\". Each alter has their own 'station', which appears to serve as home when they are not in control. In the lower section of the Underground, is a well where the alters can go to destroy themselves. This is where Miranda was \\"killed\\". This well houses Daddy, an alter who resembles their father, in the deepest, most protected part of the Underground. The alters consist of: * Baby Doll: A telekinetic (rarely-seen ability) childlike alter that believes everything is lovely. Is said to be one of the few personalities that trust men. * Baby Harlot: An integration of Baby Doll and Scarlet Harlot. * Bizzie Lizzie Borden: Jane's ninth alter, who may not be real. * Black Annis: An aggressive alter, equipped with sharp claws, red eyes, and blue skin. In the TV series, she stood guard over the station that held Daddy. Also misandrist, one who hates men, so she never lets any men pass her. * Blood of the Lamb: No given information. In this form, their body is covered head to toe in blood coming from unknown (or nonexistent) wounds. * Bubble * Butterfly Baby: Constantly suffers pain on a Hellraiser-like level in the deepest part of the mind. * Crazy Jane: The dominant alter, or \\"host\\".

Arguably as aggressive as Hammerhead, yet also fond of Baby Doll and her antics. * Driver 8: Conductor of the Underground subway, named after the R.E.M. song. The Driver's hat has an infinity symbol (a sideways \\"8\\") on it. * Flaming Katy: One of the \\"protecting\\" personalities, protecting Jane whenever she feels threatened.

The other alters are unsure of how to react to Liza and feel threatened by her. She is named after a song by The Jam, the B-side of their single \\"Start!\\". * Lucy Fugue: She has radioactive bones and see-through skin. She can also generate harmonic vibrations, a power she used to defeat the Antigod. In the live-action series, this personality has electrical powers. In the underground, this personality is portrayed as an Asian woman with electric-blue streaks in her black beehive hairdo. * Mama Pentecost: An expert enigma and cryptogram solver. * Merry Andrew: Dresses as a Harlequin and carries toys. * Miranda: The former host who took over after Kay went dormant; she destroys herself after the church incident. Her \\"station\\" is now occupied by some indescribable horror, visible from a distance only as a weird light, which only Driver 8 can see without being destroyed by the vision (she covers Cliff's eyes as they pass through this area, in Comic Canon). Per the TV show's canon, Miranda's station is populated by noose-hung bodies and tortured souls. Miraculously returned after the Candlemaker killed Katy and Baby Doll in the Underground, and took over as primary to better ensue Kay's needs.

In the nineteenth century, people arrived at Chautauqua via ferryboats and disembarked at Palestine Park so that their first footsteps were on the Holy Land as though they were pilgrims going up to Jerusalem; an actual journey to the Land of Israel was well beyond the financial ability of most Americans in that era.Chautauqua America, Peter Feinman, The American Interest, Vol V, no. 5, May/June 2010, pp. 83-8.

Before a user can access a file on a Unix-like machine, the file system that contains it needs to be mounted with the mount command. Frequently mount is used for SD card, USB storage, DVD and other removable storage devices. The command is also available in the EFI shell. Overview The mount command instructs the operating system that a file system is ready to use, and associates it with a particular point in the overall file system hierarchy (its mount point) and sets options relating to its access. Mounting makes file systems, files, directories, devices and special files available for use and available to the user. Its counterpart umount instructs the operating system that the file system should be disassociated from its mount point, making it no longer accessible and may be removed from the computer. It is important to umount a device before removing it since changes to files may have only partially been written and are completed as part of the umount. The mount and umount commands require root user privilege to effect changes. Alternately, specific privileges to perform the corresponding action may have been previously granted by the root user. A file system can be defined as user mountable in the \`/etc/fstab\` file by the root user. Use Display all mounted partitions: $ mount proc on /proc type proc (rw) sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw) devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620) /dev/sda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw) /tmp on /var/tmp type none (rw,noexec,nosuid,bind) 10.4.0.4:/srv/export/setup_server on /nfs/setup_server type nfs (ro,addr=10.4.0.4) This example will mount the second partition of a HDD (hard disk drive): $ mount /dev/hda2 /media/PHOTOS and will unmount (by referring to the physical disk partition): $ umount /dev/hda2 or (by referring to the mount point) $ umount /media/PHOTOS To remount a partition with specific options: $ mount -o remount,rw /dev/hda2 Derivatives and wrappers \`pmount\` is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. This provides a robust basis for automounting frameworks like GNOME's Utopia project and keeps the usage of root to a minimum. This package also contains a wrapper pmount-hal, which reads information such as device labels and mount options from HAL and passes it to pmount. The \`gnome-mount\` package contains programs for mounting, unmounting and ejecting storage devices. The goal for gnome-mount is for GNOME software such as gnome-volume-manager and GNOME-VFS to use this instead of invoking mount/umount/eject/pmount or direct HAL invoking methods. GNOME previously used pmount. Note, gnome-mount is not intended for direct use by users. All the gnome-mount programs utilize HAL methods and as such run unprivileged. The rationale for gnome-mount is to have a centralized place (in GConf) where settings such as mount options and mount locations are maintained.gnome-mount-0.6 As with all unix-like commands, the options are specific to the version of mount and are precisely detailed in its man page. In addition to the system call mount, the function mount_root() mounts the first, or root filesystem. In this context mount is called by the system call setup.

Biography Born on the \\"Piano Island\\" of Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, Fujian, in the People's Republic of China. Although trained as a classical pianist, he is perhaps best known to the West through the Yellow River Piano Concerto he arranged based on the Yellow River Cantata and performed in many Western theaters since the 1980s. Yin started learning the piano in 1948 when he was seven years old, and gave his first recital at the age of nine. At twelve, he joined the preparatory school of Shanghai Conservatory of Music. In 1959, Yin won an award at the World Youth Peace and Friendship Festival in Vienna, Austria, and in 1960, he was sent to the Leningrad Conservatory to study. In 1962, he and American pianist Susan Starr were the second-prize winners of the International Tchaikovsky Competition (Vladimir Ashkenazy shared the first-prize with British pianist John Odgon). In 1965, Yin joined the Central Symphony Orchestra of China as a soloist. Cultural revolution During the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), Yin's name changed by ‚ÄúÊÆ∑ËØöÂø†‚Äù. When all Western arts and forms were forbidden, Yin passionately and geniously found an application of his talent: he created the piano-accompanied version of The Legend of the Red Lantern, one of the Eight model plays, the only plays, operas and ballets which were permitted during the period. Although, musically speaking, there was not much originality in the work, it was refreshing for genuine music lovers who were longing to have access to Western music. Another creation attributed to Yin is the now well-known Yellow River Piano Concerto. Yin and other members of a special committee arranged this work in 1969 based on the Yellow River Cantata by Xian Xinghai. In the final movement of the concerto, Yin incorporated the melody The East Is Red. The instruments used, the piano and the orchestra, were all Western, but the music was heavily influenced by Chinese folk melodies. United States In 1983, following difficulties with the new post-Mao Chinese Communist Party due to his alleged closeness to the Gang of Four, Yin emigrated to the US, and in the same year, he made his debut in Carnegie Hall in New York City. Yin has since performed under the baton of Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Claudio Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Kirill Kondrashin and the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sir Malcolm Sargent and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Yin has also appeared in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto, and at Lincoln Center. His solo performances were featured on China Central Television and CBS Sunday Morning. Formerly a professor and artist-in- residence at the Cleveland Institute of Music, Mr. Yin now lives in New York City. Yin has released more than 20 albums, including an all-Chopin CD, a recording of Debussy's Preludes, and the Yellow River Concerto.

He was classically trained in Ashtanga Yoga ‚Äì Raja Yoga of Patanjali (the Yoga of Eight Limbs),What is Ashtanga Yoga, The Eight Limbs: Yamas and Niyamas; http://pacificcultural.org/yiteachings.html Pacific Cultural Center, Santa Cruz, CA as well as Kriya Yoga, Ayurveda, Samkhya, Tantra Yoga, Vedanta, and Sanskrit. Born into the 13th generation of a Kumaoni Karnatak Brahmin lineage, in the lunar month of Chaitra, in Shukla Paksha (Rama Navami),http://www.drikpanchang.com/navratri/chaitra-vasant-navratri- dates.html?year=1923 he belonged to a traditional family and was one of several siblings (four brothers and two sisters). He was an author, playwright, martial arts teacher, sculptor and builder of temples. Upon his arrival in the US in the early 1971, he and his teachings inspired the creation of several yoga centers and retreat programs in California and in Canada. His extensive literary output includes scriptural commentaries to Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Samkhya Karika, and Vedanta, collections of wisdom aphorisms about the meaning and purpose of life, essays, plays, short stories, children's stories, kirtan mantras, and in-depth instructional yoga materials that form the basis of a yoga certification- training program. He was an early proponent of Ayurveda in the United States, an ancient Indian system of health and healing. In an annual rendition of Indian classic Ramayana,David C. Fuess; Ramayana ‚Äì Self Service; The Wall Street Journal, October 1983; page iB he taught performing arts, choreography and costume making. With the emphasis on selfless service (karma yoga) that guided his life and action that benefits the world, he devoted himself to helping others and in 1987 he opened Sri Ram Orphanage in Haridwar for homeless children in India. Although he did not speak, he was conversant in several languages in writing. To the local population of Nainital and Almora, Baba Hari Dass was also known as Haridas (lit \\"servant of Lord Hari\\"), as Haridas Baba, as Chota Maharaji (literally \\"little great king\\"), or as Harda Baba. Baba Hari Dass of Almora-Nainital is a different person than Swami Haridas who was a spiritual poet and classical musician of Bhakti movement era. Also, Haridas (1594 - 1691 AD) was a known saint of (Dagar) clan from Delhi whose temple exists in Jharoda Kalan village, in Najafgarh. Early life and spiritual path (1923‚Äì1943) Baba Hari Dass grew up in the lower Himalayan region of Kumaon division, which includes Dunagiri (also called Dronagiri), known as the birthplace of modern-day Kriya Yoga, and the temple of Shakti or Mother Goddess. Rich in ancient lore, already known during times of Mahabharata War, the region is also known as Kurmachalam and encompasses Almora, Nainital, Bageshwar, Champawat, Pithoragarh, and Udham Singh Nagar. Early on in life he listened to stories told by older people about siddha yogis Sombari Baba Maharaj, Gudari Baba, Suri Baba, Khaki Baba, Aughar Baba, and several other saints of that region. His parents were devotees of a legendary saint of Kumaon, Hariakhan Baba Maharaj, who \\"used to come to Almora\\". In 1929, on the way to Haldwani, during the winter time, he received his first darshana with the sage Sombari Baba Maharaj,Be Love Now: The Path of the Heart; by Ram Dass and Rameshwar Das; 2010, Harper Collins Publishers, New York; ; p. 284-290. also known as Paramanandji Maharaj in the village Kakrighat, by the Koshi river, where Sombari Baba Maharaj lived under a huge Banyan tree in a tiny hut built into its roots. Darshana is viewed as experiencing the presence of a highly revered person, which can awaken latent potential for spiritual growth, or intellectual understanding. An American poet, Gary Snyder, who was immersed in the Buddhist Zen tradition, explaining his meaning noted, \\"It's a gift; it's like there's a moment in which the thing is ready to let you see it. In India, this is called darshan. Darshan means getting a view..\\"White, Jonathan, ed. (1994). Talking on the water: conversations about nature and creativity. San Francisco: Sierra Club Books. . = Leaving home at the age of eight = His early childhood years were marked by sadness and the feeling of separation: \\"When I was small, about five-six years old, I began to feel unhappy and sad inside. That sadness would be enhanced at the sunset at the Himalayas...A feeling of separation would come, and I would feel like I was closed inside a box where it is dark. The dome of the sky and the earth at night would make me feel like I was inside the box. 'How can I get out of this box?' was my constant question.\\" His parents were puzzled by his strange behaviour of leaving the house early in the morning and refusing to go into the house. He also didn't like to go to school to learn reading and writing. His father was a tough disciplinarian, a Sanskrit scholar, and a very set in his own ideas. He was forced to learn and memorize Sanskrit grammar and prayers. In 1931-1932 his father died at the age of 56 of a heart attack. That event shook the whole family, but brought also a feeling of relief. The biggest pressure lifted, he was free to do anything he wanted. However, he assumed more responsibilities by helping his mother in farming, taking care of the cows, or thrashing grains. Also, he had to go to school and do homework. He was attracted to freedom that monks had in their lifestyle, free from excess of clothing, unburdened by work, and who didn't have to attend school. \\"Whenever any monk would come to the village temple, I would go to see them, I started living like a monk.\\" His mother, when she came home one day, found him sitting in the room wearing only a loincloth, with wood ash smeared all over his body. She said, \\"Son, there is no happiness in the world, there is no peace in household life. I know you are very attracted to monk life but that is not easy task either.\\" He had several conversations with his mother about God, soul and peace. His view of the surrounding world as being a restraining box made of earth as the bottom and sky as the top induced him to weep. He decided it had to be lifted. He made known that conviction to his mother asking her to release him from the confinement of \\"this box of earth and sky.\\" To that she said, \\"I can't\\", he replied, \\"I'm going.\\" = Brahmacharya school = With his mother's consent, he had left home at the age of eight\\"Baba Hari Dass\\"; Encyclopedia of Hinduism; Constance A. Jones and James D. Ryan; Infobase Publishing, New York; 2007; and joined an ashram for young yoga practitioners in the jungles of Kumaon, where he was initiated into Brahmacharya.Baba Hari Dass, The Yellow Book: The Sayings of Baba Hari Dass, Lama Foundation; 1st ed. 1973; A regimented daily schedule included six hours of sleep, getting up at 4 am, walking in the dark a mile to take bath in a river regardless of the season or weather conditions, a teacher-guided group study of doing school homework and preparing for exams. The underlying premise of that lifestyle, based in \\"We can train our body in any way we want,\\" included daily duties of manual labour, carrying water from a river in a valley, collecting firewood, cooking, cleaning, and gardening. He practiced and became proficient in martial arts, Hatha Yoga, Shatkarma, Mudras and Sanskrit. One day, when their Brahmacharya school teacher left, young coeds decided to continue with their daily regimen and study for school requirements. = Naga Baba, Udasi Baba and Swami Nityananda Maharaj = His interest in monk-lifestyle resurfaced on more than one occasion. He contacted traveling sannyasins in temples or in public engagements in order to learn their wisdom and inquire about yoga techniques. Some of those early encounters fell short of his expectations. Trying to learn about life of Naga Baba (naked sannyasin) became a debacle. Michiefs other boys engaged in, throwing rocks, or disturbing the monk's meditation resulted in cursing, angry outbursts and a chase. Another sannyasin who attracted his attention was Udasi Baba. He was credited by adult followers as possessing super normal powers over ghosts, or curing sickness, and who lived in a cremation ground. One day, when he had nobody to cremate at his site, he joined an encampment of local people and looked like an ordinary man who craved attention. He acknowledged his tells of subduing ghosts were created with the purpose: \\"ghosts are for those who are afraid of ghosts.‚Äù Those encounters, in a young, 12 years old Brahmachari, resulted in diminishing attraction for a monk-like lifestyle. In the winter of 1935, he met Swami Nityananda Maharaj, who stayed and lectured in a big house - gatherings many adults attended. For a boy to mix with adults following monks was not encouraged. It was believed that young lads couldn't understand the spiritual subjects, however, from the Brahmachari perspective \\"Older people simply became a hindrance for youngsters.\\" Since lectures of Swami Nithyanandaji's were in English, he could not understand the content, yet he was keen to observe the ascetic form of the Swami, wearing a tiger skin and using a trident stuff, a follower of the Shiva order, and a pilgrim on his way to the mount Kailash. That experience brought in him questions and confusion about God, he believed God could create and control everything. = First teaching in Hatha Yoga and Swami Satyananda Giri = In 1936, he attended classes of Swami Satyananda Giri of Dashnami Sanyasi Sect (originated by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya), who visited Almora region. Swami Satyananda was well versed in classical yoga tenets and encouraged adults to use practices of Hatha Yoga. He postulated that developing strong body, in which the soul resides, aids in the journey to attain emancipation. Techniques he demonstrated and explained were based in Hatha Yoga seven limbs: Shatkarma, Asana, Mudra, Pratyahara, Pranayama, Dhyana, and Samadhi. He also used Ayurvedic principles of the balanced food of three-doshas, consistent eating habits, and avoided oily and fat rich foods. When young Brahmachari (Baba Hari Dass) was asked to demonstrate what he knew, Swamiji was surprised and pleased to see well developed postures, mudras, etc. Brahmachari explained he practiced those in Brahmachari School by his own doing rather than learning from someone else (asanas, pranayamas, shatkarmas, and mudras). Swamiji asked him to teach others in his class, who were adults. \\"Swamiji saw my sarvang- asana and was very pleased..I showed the series of 12 postures of surya- namaskar (sun salutation). Swamiji liked the way I did the postures and said I should come back every morning and show the people the method of doing asanas.\\" Due to that teaching experience, his feeling of a misfit in the class and shyness went away. He was also well received by adults learners. = Darshana of Ananda Mayi Ma and her samadhi = In 1936, when Anandamayi Ma visited Almora region, he experienced her darshana in a trance state some interpreted as samadhi: \\"..a woman who looked to be 35-40 years old. Her eyes were closed. Her face looked like golden light. Everyone outside bowed to her and people hurriedly took her to Ranikhet to a secluded place to rest.\\" He listened to a lecture by a pundit who invoked the Yoga Sutras to interpret her state of consciousness and how samadhi brings knowledge of God. Intrigued, he discussed his darshana with an older colleague in the Brahmacharya coed, and was dissaudated to view samadhi as an emotionally induced trance that could occur during devotional singing (kirthan) or dancing. In contrast, by formal training, practice of pranayama and meditation (dhyana), samadhi could take deeper roots. In that discussion the issue was raised of renouncing the world. Becoming a sannyasi had the consequences of radical departure from social norms as compared to a householder life (grihastha): ‚ÄûIf everyone renounces the world then one day all the old generation will die out and there will be no new generation.‚Äù He agreed that such statement was quite right, however, since everyone is not meant to be a householder, the natural balance will still be sustained by everyone performing duties for the world. He felt good about that view and didn't lose his attraction for a life of a renounciate. His quest continued when he was about 14 years old: \\"I visited different villages in Himalayan mountains.\\" In that experience he encountered several Westerners who were learning yogic practices and remembered them as \\"true seekers\\". That shaped his attitude towards inclusive way of teaching yoga later on. = Initiation into Sannyasa diksha = He was initiated with Sannyasa diksha at the age of 19 years, in 1942,\\"In 1942 he took initiation as a monk in the Vairagi Tyagi Vaishnavite order\\"; Encyclopedia of Hinduism; Constance A. Jones and James D. Ryan; Baba Hari Dass; Infobase Publishing, New York; 2007; into the Vairagi-Tyagi Vaishnava, order of Ramanandi Sampradaya (followers of Saint Ramananda originated in the 15th century), by his guru, Baba Raghubar Dassji Maharaj, a reclusive sadhu, he met in Ramkot Hanuman Temple (Almora region). A highly regarded renunciate and a Sanskrit Acharya, he was known for minimal verbal communication and did not have a large disciple following. He met with his disciples only once in every two-three years to convey yoga sƒÅdhanƒÅ instructions to his followers.The Babaji Interview; By Devyn (Mount Madonna School); https://archive.today/20140617232846/http://newsasaurus.newscenter.com/articles/09April/09AprilBabaji.html He's quoted as saying: \\"First find unity within, in your thoughts, words and actions and the unity outside will follow you.\\" In 1952‚Äì1953, while living in a burial place called Ghati, Baba Hari Dass described experience of a legendary Kumaon yogi Hariakhan Baba while staying in a cave in cold winter. While sitting by the side of the fire he fainted and his left arm fell into that fire: \\"I saw Hariakhan Maharaj come into the room and bend over me‚Ä¶, I saw him clearly, removing my left arm from the fire pit... By some unknown power I was related to Hariakhan Maharaj.\\"Baba Hari Dass, Hairakhan Baba: Known, Unknown, Sri Rama Foundation, 1975, p. 76-79 =Vow of silence and tapas= Silence is the only Voice of our God - Herman Melville (Pierre: or, The Ambiguities, Bk. XIV, ch. 1, 1852,) In 1952, Baba Hari Dass took a continual vow of silence called mauna (or maunavrata). In a similar tradition of Buddhist meditative method of Vipasana, silence is used \\"as the process of self-purification by introspection.\\" In 1964, Bhagavan Das met Baba Hari Dass near a temple called Hanuman Girdi, in Nainital, and later wrote: \\"The sadhu was a muni, a yogi whose practice of austerity includes complete silence. For the previous twelve years, whenever he wanted to communicate, he would jot his thoughts succinctly on a small chalkboard.\\"Bhagavan Das, It's Here Now (Are You?), Broadway Books, New York, 1997 Similarly, in 1967, Ram Dass: \\"He is a jungle sadhu. He went into the jungle when he was 8 years old. He is silent (mauna). He has been mauna for 15 years. He writes with a chalkboard.\\"http://beherenow.us.to/hisstory01.htm#ASHTANGA YOGA; BE HERE NOW, by Ram Dass, First published in 1971 Even as continued silence would seem a radical but also inconvenient form of communication, several Western authors recognized the social value of silence. Among those were Jacques Derrida and S√∏ren Kierkegaard. In their view, silence would function as a precursor for clearer and substantively deeper understanding. Michael Strawser (Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Central Florida), commenting on Jacques Derrida's view of Soren Kierkegaard's meaning of silence, wrote, \\"What is needed is Kierkegaard's call to silence in order to recognize one's responsibility to the other.\\"Michael Strawser, Gifts of Silence from Kierkegaard and Derrida, Penn State University Press, Vol. 89, No. 1/2, Spring/Summer 2006; Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal; ; https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40052851 Silence is also valued by Perkey Avot, in the Jewish Sages guide for living, and functions as \\"a safety fence for wisdom\\". In yoga, mauna is maintained with the aim of achieving uninterrupted concentration (ekagrata, Sanskrit: ‡§è‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§æ). Side effects of such practice would include constraining outgoing emotions of the mind, such as anger, excessive argumentativeness, etc. In Ashtanga Yoga, mauna would be part of a larger body of practices called tapas (Sanskrit: ‡§§‡§™‡§∏‡•ç). Overall, mauna as practice of tapas would not be viewed as penance but rather \\"as a mental training to develop will power\\".\\"Tapas is not a penance, it's a mental training to develop will power\\" ‚Äì Baba Hari Dass; On Ashtanga Yoga, Silence Speaks, p.153, Sri Rama Foundation Inc, 1977 In the beginning of his practice he encountered obstacles, \\"For twelve years I faced much difficulties...for two or three years you have to fight with anger.\\" Since merely not talking is not considered a yogic silence, keeping a quiet mind is, \\"The mind can't be stopped merely by keeping your mouth shut.\\" Baba Hari Dass - silent yogi writing on a chalkboard, circa 1976, California. In 1983, David C. Fuess (a writer for The Wall Street Journal), observed about Baba Hari Dass: \\"Babaji had not spoken for twenty-nine years and communicates by a means of a small chalk board.\\"David C. Fuess, Ramayana ‚Äì Selfless Service, The Wall Street Journal, October 1983, page iB In 2008, Melissa Weaver, Santa Cruz Sentinel correspondent, wrote: \\"During classes, he sits in a wood-backed chair, his students... sit patiently while he writes his thoughts on a wipe-off board, which are then read aloud by a volunteer.\\"Silent yogi has led Mount Madonna community tucked in the Santa Cruz Mountains for more than 30 years, Melissa Weaver ‚Äì (Santa Cruz) Sentinel correspondent, 14 July 2008; http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9875268 =Karma yogi builder= Early on in his life Haridas Baba was influenced by the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, which consider karma yoga to be a selfless service, and the most straightforward pathway to progress in spiritual life. He learned temple masonry from a local mason and used those skills in building temples, ashrams, statues of deities, and rock walls. In more than one of those projects he had a lead role. In 1950‚Äì1964 with the help of local followers and volunteers, adults and children, he built Hanumangarh and later Kainchi Ashram in Nainital.The Divine Reality, a publication by Sri Kainchi Hanuman Mandir & Ashram, stated: \\"Haridas Baba used to come to Kainchi from Hanumangarh to supervise the construction work of Kainchi Ashram.\\"The Divine Reality of Sri Baba Neeb Karori Ji Maharaj (A Translation of Alokik Yathartha), A Case of Typhoid; 1 January 2005, by Sri Kainchi Hanuman Mandir & Ashram; 2nd ed., In 1962, after Hanumangarh, and Kenchi (Kainchi) Ashram, he started to build an ashram at Kakrighat where Sombari Maharaj lived, which was later completed on a contract basis.Baba Hari Dass, Hariakhan Baba: Known, Unknown, Sri Rama Foundation, 1975, p. 78-79, In the United States and Canada,http://saltspringcentre.com/about/baba-hari-dass/ he continued using his considerable design, planning and construction skills. In Feb 1982, in the aftermath of destructive fire that burnt a recently constructed program building (Mount Madonna Center, Watsonville, CA), he considered that to be a new opportunity to start building a larger structure with more capacity. His example inspired many volunteers to help with those karma yoga efforts. In 1983, Yoga Journal writer, Virginia Lee, said \\"Baba Hari Dass swings his hammer alongside everyone else\\".The Silent Master of Mount Madonna Center; Yoga Journal, May/June 1983; by Virginia Lee; p. 18-20 The same publication added in 2002, in Karma Yoga Awards, Saving Young Lives, that Baba Hari Dass beginning with 1986 started donating proceeds from his books publishing to Sri Ram Foundation that was set up to help destitute children in India. From those funds, and other donations, Shri Ram Ashram was created near Haridwar, in India. = Local teacher-leader = At the end of the 1930s several encounters with Western seekers in India started to shape his attitude towards possible yoga teaching choices in future. He became cognizant of the possibility of a larger learners' influx, which would create the need of preserving genuine yogic tradition that he grew with for deserving students. \\"When I was about 14 years old...I saw number of Westerners. Some had taken sannyasa..it was quite clear that they were true seekers\\" In India, yoga practices were tested for thousands of years and it became known how each method affects the body, mind and consciousness. By adopting a well-known method of Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali, Yamas and Niyamas, as his core practice, he aimed to shorten the time required for mastering essential routines. Otherwise, if new experimentation is needed \\"when those methods are changed, they are again subject to testing.\\" Several of his early students were Europeans and followers of the back-to-basics philosophy who were traveling to India and were followed by beatniks, such as Allen Ginsburg and others. During one of the subsequent waves of interest in Indian spirituality and yoga, in the early 1960s, some newcomers to Nainital district were directed to Haridas Baba to receive instructions in hatha yoga, meditation and yogic life. \\"A young Englishman named Lawrie...was allowed to stay in the ashram, studying with Haridas Baba\\". He had established a local following and was considered an adept teacher, a leader and builder in several building and karma yoga construction projects at Hanuman Garhi and Nainital Ashram temples. Dada Mukerjee (Sri Sudhir Mukerjee), recounting those events wrote: \\"Haridas was also very active in building the Kainchin temples and purchasing materials for them\\", and \\"Haridas...was well-versed in pujas and rituals, as well as in pranayam and meditation, and an experienced practitioner of hatha yoga..., he also looked after the devotees who came there... Ram Dass stayed there in 1967 and Lawrie in 1964, among others.\\"Dada Mukerjee, Umadatta Shukla 1 Chapter, Hanuman Foundation, 1 May 2000; ; http://maharajji.com/Near-and-the- Dear/umadutta-shukla-1-chapter.html Western confluence (1964‚Äì1971) = Bhagavan Das and hospital episode = Bhagavan Das was introduced to Baba Hari Dass in Nainital, Hanuman Garhi (the Fortress of Hanuman, ) Bhagavan Dass described that experience: \\"Hari Das was the real thing, a cave yogi\\", and, \\"I showed Hari Dass Baba how I did these kriyas, and he helped me perfect my technique\\".It‚Äôs Here Now (Are You?): A Spiritual Memoir; Broadway Books, Ney York, 1997, 1st ed; ; Ch 6, p.43-44 In 1968, in meditation, Bhagavan Das, according to his own account, was able to recognize Baba Hari Dass was in danger, who was then under a supervised doctor care in Agra, arranged by Neem Karoli. Bhagavan Das drove from Nainital overnight and removed him from that life-threatening condition. After few days Baba Hari Dass wrote, \\"You saved my life\\". Explaining that episode, Bhagavan Das interpreted the event with considerable hesitation. He reported the incident took place in Lucknow (not in Agra) and interpreted Baba Hari Dass' refusal of further treatments as a dislike of Western medicine: \\"being subjected to Western medical techniques was a death sentence?\\" He didn't offer Baba Hari Dass' view of that medical treatment and left the reason why and by whom it was arranged unanswered. =Ram Dass ‚Äì learning yoga= In 1967 an ex-Harvard professor Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) travelled to India and was taken to Kainchi - Nainital region by Bhagavan Dass. At that time Baba Hari Dass was already an accomplished yoga teacher and had a large following. On his guru's (Neem Karoli Baba) recommendation, Ram Dass received teachings of Ashtanga Yoga: \\"Baba Hari Dass was my teacher. I was taught by this man with a chalkboard in the most terse way possible\\". Baba Hari Dass trained Ram Dass in Raja Yoga (also known as Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali), asana, pranayama, mantras, mudras, ahimsa (non- violence) and focused meditation. \\"Hari Dass Baba, who had been my sadhana tutor while I lived in Kainchi.Ram Dass Biography, \\"...Hari Dass Baba, who taught in silence using only a chalkboard. For a time, Alpert was in correspondence with Meher Baba however he remained focused on the teaching of Hari Dass Baba...\\" Each morning around 11:30 Hari Dass Baba would come from Hanumangarh sixteen kilometers away to give me lessons in yoga.\\" The aim of training and practices of yoga-sadhana was for Ram Dass to become an adept practitioner and teacher of classical Ashtanga Yoga in the US and to increase interest in yoga and spirituality in general. Building a yoga center in India or the US and publishing yoga books authored by Baba Hari Dass were also discussed. That training of several months continued in a series of letters between Baba Hari Dass and Ram Dass in the period of 1967‚Äì1969. \\"He was training me to become an ascetic, although I never really became one.\\" Ashtanga Yoga practices and observances were later included in the 1971 book Be Here Now and became a reference material for beginning yoga learners in the 1970s until Baba Hari Dass authored his comprehensive and detailed Ashtanga Yoga Primer (1977). Some benefits of those learning experiences in India were long-lasting, \\"The aphasia has introduced silence into my conversation...I had training for this kind of thing when I was with Baba Hari Dass in India. I was mauna,\\" or, \\"Silence brought me great energy of clarity. As Hari Dass wrote, 'Nothing is better than something.'\\" = Parting from Neem Karoli = In 1968, Haridas, \\"who was very active in building the Kainichi temples and purchasing materials for them\\" in Nainital, discontinued involvement with Neem Karoli, known also as Neem Karoli Baba, Neeb Karori, or by his householder name as Lakshmi Narayan Sharma. That association lasted since the mid 1950s when \\"Haridas with his band of enthusiastic and active associates, was managing the affairs of the temples and ashram in Hanumangarh\\". Since his childhood Haridas Baba had accepted disciplined life as essential in spiritual progress. He became a monk and adopted silence as a way of seeking inner peace. For health reasons, and to eliminate digestive problems he had with his liver, he chose to drink a glass of milk once or twice a day instead of taking solid food. Since the early days of his association with Neem Karoli he encountered several obstacles in his observance of silence, or eating habits. During one Kumbha Mela, he was obligated by Neem Karoli to break those monastic rules for the reason of following the house rules as having higher but whimsical priority (\\"What is this rule? For what purpose is it made?\\"). When he became a teacher in the 1950s, Baba Hari Dass sought conducive circumstances for his teaching environment to benefit learners; \\"He wanted to build a small community of his own devotees\\". Several disruptions and conflicts that occurred in Kainchi ashram where he was a resident, teacher and supervisor, were not well suited for that end. The Kainchi ashram became a difficult place with charged economic claims between local residents and newcomers who were outsiders and who by displacing local members were not acknowledging their share of efforts in building and maintaining the ashram. Excessive hoarding of goods and secret dealings to cover for Neem Karoli's sudden appearances and disappearances in order to create an impression of yogic powers (siddhis) were also contentious issues. Recognizing that, Neem Karoli's intimate devotee, (Sudhir) Dada Mukerjee wrote, \\"cases have caused much misunderstanding and heart-burning among some, and have remained as enigmas for others.\\" Cases, which point to abuses, Mukerjee interpreted as needed for the grace of his guru to manifest, so that others, including \\"Bhabania and Haridas\\", could benefit from, and that \\"we can understand reasons for the hard treatment.\\" In that context, the author does not explain how contentious circumstances would justify and absolve actions that had abusive intent. Following those events, in 1970, several Westerners already familiar with Baba Hari Dass teaching style, travelled to India, Haridwar, and convinced him to come to the US to continue his way of silent teaching. An inquiry whether Baba Hari Dass was a disciple of Neem Karoli leads to a proposition that there was no long-lasting relationship of guru-disciple in the sense of guru-shishya (or chela), although that relationship extended over several years (1954‚Äì1968) and included selfless service, guru-seva or karma-yoga done by Baba Hari Dass.Mukerjee, 1996 There was no sustained acceptance of the teachings (parampara), continuation of the said association that would last, or establishing a branch of teachings based on Neem Karoli's orientation. The content of what Baba Hari Dass taught in Ashtanga Yoga, Vedanta, Ayurveda or Samkhya classes to his students in India, in the US, or Canada, came from the independent research of his own. Acknowledging that, while in the US, to a question \\"How many teachers did you have\\", Baba Hari Dass replied \\"Myself.\\" = Ma Renu-Horsting = Baba Hari Dass and Ma Renu, watching annual volleyball competition at Mount Madonna Center, July 1998 In 1969‚Äì1970, before the book Be Here Now of Ram Dass was published in the US in Oct 1971, Ruth Johnson-Horsting (Ma Renu) was a professor of Arts at the University of California in Davis. She \\"taught sculpture at Davis from 1959 into the 70s\\" and was contacted in 1970 by her students Bondana and Mahendra Mark Jungerman, who were then searching for an advanced yoga teacher in India and found Baba Hari Dass in Haridwar. Another person who contacted him then was Paul C. Adams (Prem Das). On that occasion the prospect of inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. \\"They stayed with me and asked me to go to the United States. I said I could go anywhere. I was ready to move to the higher mountains\\". In 1970, on the recommendation of her students, Baba Hari Dass was invited to the US, and Ma Renu sponsored his stay for the purpose of teaching yoga. Ma Renu described her first meeting Baba Hari Dass: \\"I felt there was no time to lose. I had already given my permission to sponsor his stay in America, but what had been intended as a short stay, turned into a 29 year darshan and blessing.\\" \\"Ma Renu devoted herself fully to the study of Ashtanga Yoga. She became the editor of several of Babaji‚Äôs books including Silence Speaks, Fire Without Fuel, and The Path to Enlightenment is Not a Highway. She shared her study and understanding of Ashtanga Yoga with students all over the world.\\" That association over the years became a fruitful fulfillment of selfless service ideals when several organizational projects and service missions were formed in the US, Canada and India. In 1976, Baba Hari Dass directed her in forming Sri Rama Foundation to support Sri Ram Ashram for destitute children located in Shyampur, near Haridwar. Ma Renu edited several published writings of Baba Hari Dass. =Anand Dass= Jerry Tabachnick (Anand Dass) became one of the first students who recognized the need to study yoga with a live master. He became a highly regarded disciple and commentator. In 1970, he travelled to India to study with Baba Hari Dass and to gain deeper understanding of yoga. He was also active in organizing the Vancouver Satsang in Canadahttp://saltspringcentre.com/2013/03/our-satsang-community-chandrika- lajeunesse/ and became a Yoga Sutras commentator and teacher and co-authored Dharma Sara publications on yoga and yoga related subjects (1974‚Äì76). =Prenatal Yoga= Baba Hari Dass agreed to mentor his pregnant student Jeannine Parvati through a course of prenatal Yoga. During that time she continued practicing asanas and authored Prenatal Yoga & Natural Childbirth, published in 1974.\\"Practicing Yoga during pregnancy is one way to heal the split between soul and spirit found in our culture\\", p. XII, Jeannine Parvati Baker, North Atlantic Books, , 1986 As the daughter of a First Nation father (Ute tribe) and as a longtime student of Baba Hari Dass, Jeannine Parvati Baker's midwifery philosophy was one of earth-based values and non-harming principles.Prenatal Yoga - Natural Childbirthing, Jeannine Parvati Baker, North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA, 1986, p. 109; After \\"Prenatal Yoga\\" gained in popularity, Baba Hari Dass expounded supporting practices of yoga to include prenatal asana, pranayama, meditation, Ayurveda, and mindfulness techniques for labor that formed the basis of Prenatal Yoga Teacher Training. The emphasis was given on anatomy and physiology of pregnancy, common discomforts in pregnancy, and how to support mothers through every stage of pregnancy and postpartum. =The impact of Be Here Now and Chota Maharaji= How the Swamis Came to the States, written by Richard Leviton, in Yoga Journal, Mar/Apr 1990, proposed a timeline of influential yoga teachers in the US. That overview covered 100 years (1890‚Äì1990) of multicultural developments in yoga influences with a focus in larger audience teaching. Among those, the beginning of yoga teaching of Baba Hari Dass in the US was seen as starting in 1971. Prior to that, \\"Baba Hari Dass's reputation preceded his arrival in America by about two years\\", confirming his teaching engagements going back to at least 1969 as well established in India. Earlier credible accounts also exist (Bhagavan Das and Ram Dass) that confirm in 1963‚Äì64 he was a teacher of already considerable skills engaged in teaching others. In Feb 1971 Baba Hari Dass was teaching in the US when later the same year Be Here Now (1st edition, Oct 1971) by Ram Dass was published by the Lama Foundation, in New Mexico. Be Here Now, a manuscript initially titled From Bindu to Ojas (one thousand copies published in 1970), included information on yoga practices and theory compiled from what Baba Hari Dass had taught about hatha yoga, yogic life and conduct during daily morning sessions in Nainital mentioned by Ram Dass in his later writings, \\"I spent five months under his tutelage\\". That book, viewed as significant contribution to the public knowledge in the United States and Canada about yoga and Baba Hari Dass as a master yogi, was re-edited after \\"eighty thousand copies\\" were already distributed. Richard Leviton uses the first edition of Be Here Now. He notes that Ram Dass called Baba Hari Dass \\"this incredible fellow\\" as one of his teachers. Ram Dass used several affirmative remarks about Baba Hari Dass, also known as Chota Maharaji in his native Nainital-Almora region, that he later removed from the first edition. In Be Love Now, published in 2010, explanation was given for the content removal in a dialogue between Ram Dass and his guru Neem Karoli that took place in 1971. \\"I had mixed up Hari Dass and Maharaji when I heard the story from Hari Dass.\\" \\"The story\\", which is repeated with some changes in another autobiographical book Polishing the Mirror: How to Live from Your Spiritual Heart, was about who left his home at the age of eight. Several sources pointed out that Neem Karoli (Lakshmi Narayan Sharma, married in 1911, he had two sons and one daughter) left his home at the age of 11‚Äì12 years old, \\"After the wedding, the groom left home and wandered the country\\". For Baba Hari Dass, leaving home took place at younger age when he was eight years old.Jones, Constance; Ryan, James D. (2006). \\"Encyclopedia of Hinduism ‚Äì Baba Hari Dass\\". Encyclopedia of Hinduism(Infobase Publishing). Retrieved 23 July. 2014. With a sense of needed spiritual liberation and the discussion he had with his mother, \\"Take me out of this box of earth and sky,\\" Baba Hari Dass left home and was not bound by the customary child marriage in India arrangement prevalent at that time, before it was declared illegal in 1929, or by the family's promise obligations that such marriage would impose. Teaching to learn (1971-2018) Mount Madonna Center, California, Baba Hari Dass, Sep 2013 =Physical foundation and social involvement= In the US, in early 1971, in Sea Ranch in Sonoma County, and in Santa Rosa, California, he started teaching core yoga practices which later became an aerobic hatha yoga regimen of Fitness Asanas aimed to increase physical endurance in support of meditation. Later, kirtan, mudras, fire ceremony (yajna), and satsang were introduced to complement a busy schedule. In 1972, as interest grew, several events were organized that included demonstrations of yoga asanas, shatkarma, and mudras (Lama Foundation in New Mexico, Coconut Grove in Florida, and Santa Cruz in California) . He also traveled to Canada to establish Dharmasara community in Toronto, Salt Spring Centre of yoga, on Salt Spring Island BC, and Dharma Sara Satsang, in Vancouver, BC. In 1974 the Lama Foundation published his first book, The Yellow Book,The Lama Foundation, 1974, San Cristobal, NM a collection of aphorisms that included terse but revealing statements (\\"all babies are yogis\\"), or longer question-answer format on life topics. In 1975 his second book, \\"a compilation of stories about one of the greatest and most mysterious of India's saints\\",Foreword, Hariakhan Baba - Known, Unknown, Sri Rama Foundation, Davis, CA, 1975. Hariakhan Baba - Known, Unknown, was issued by Sri Rama Foundation. In 1977 came out another collection of a well-received question-answer discussions in Silence Speaks, which became a hallmark of his silent style of teaching with few written words in subsequent publications by Sri Rama Publishing. His experiences and skills in designing, building and management of Kainchi and Hanumangarh ashrams in Nainital, India, took a new form when the Hanuman Fellowship was created in 1974The Hanuman Fellowship is a non-profit organization founded by the students of Baba Hari Dass in 1971; http://hanumanfellowship.org/) in Santa Cruz, California. He advised his followers to write letters to friends, associates, etc., to find a large, open space, in out-of-city surroundings. After a long search, in 1976, one response came from Lois Bateson (wife of the late anthropologist Gregory Bateson) who located a ranger who managed a large property in the Santa Cruz Mountains that would be sold on the condition the new buyers would preserve its natural state. That led to the establishment in 1978 of Mount Madonna Center for Creative ArtsA Conference, Retreat and Yoga Center in the Heart of California; http://mountmadonna.org/ in Watsonville. The vast space of the mountainous terrain was well suited for physical work with many volunteers working as karma yogis. On 23 February 1982, the main program building was already finished, when a candle light from a puja-table started a fire that burnt that building down. In the summer of the same year, \\"the response to the disaster was overwhelming\\", and a new plan was implemented to build a larger program building that could host multi-user activities. Baba Hari Dass developed a three-tier yoga teaching schedule for beginners, intermediate and advanced practitioners. Regular classes in Yoga Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, Satsangs events, Ramayana play, martial arts, sport activities with annual Hanuman Olympics and retreats provided rich holistic background in learning. Baba Hari Dass emphasized physical work and volunteer karma yoga services. The aim of such approach was that social contact and interaction while working together would translate into other areas and would support coherent functioning of the multi-purpose facility \\"where a spiritual aspirant could come to learn yoga and find peace.\\" Around those ideas similar projects were created at Salt Spring Centre of yoga (1974) in Canada, in Vancouver, BC, and in Pacific Cultural Center in Santa Cruz, California (1989). \\\\- I teach to learn - =US temples, and religious symbols= Shiva Lingam, Ganesha temple, Sankat Mochan Hanuman temple; Mount Madonna Center, CA; 2014. Emphasis on bhakti yoga derived from the teachings of Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana inspired several of his students to travel to India in 2001 in search of a Hanuman murti. When that statue arrived, Baba Hari Dass wrote \\"It needs a Temple.\\" He walked to the ceremonial site and marked out a location for the Temple with his foot. The Prana pratishta ceremony, \\"establishing the breath\\" within the sacred image, was performed in 2003. Sankat Mochan Hanuman, Ganesh temples,The Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple and Ganesha Temples are located within the grounds of the Mount Madonna Center for the Creative Arts and Sciences, established in 1978 by the students of Baba Hari Dass; Nandi- Shiva lingam water cascade, and several statues of deities were built at the Mount Madonna Center site. Conceived as an alternative bhakti yoga tract, the site serves local residents and can accommodate visitors from the wider community of the San Francisco Bay Area in daily visits. = Human Psychology contribution = In the West Transpersonal psychology became a rich and productive field in psychology, anthropology and psychiatry. Practices and theories of yoga added to that impact while researchers focused on energies of the subtle body that in yoga terms relate to SukShma sharira. Several authors credited Baba Hari Dass for his contributions and adept views. Steven Simon Bentheim PhD commenting on \\"spiritual\\" marriages that were made and fell apart despite the blessings of the guru, wrote: \\"Baba Hari Dass soon realized that the ideal of abstinence as a tool for spiritual development- whether it be dietary or sexual was a problem in the West.\\" Bonnie Greenwell, while working on her PhD in Transpersonal Psychology (Energies Transformation ‚Äì A Guide to the Kundalini Process) was allowed to study \\"the unpublished manuscripts of the Jnana yoga teacher Baba Hari Dass\\" (p. xi). Stuart Sovatsky PhD, commenting on Ken Wilber, Ram Dass and others whose work focused on \\"[solo] spiritual heroes\\" unwittingly garbled into Western lives the specialized family-less \\"the sadhu trip\\", wrote that Baba Hari Dass warned all Western seekers not to mix up Western life style and stringent sadhu requirements. Commenting on that he wrote, \\"For Westerners Brahmacharya is almost impossible because association between sexes is so free. Don't mix the sadhu trip in this thing\\"(Silence Speaks, p. 107). =Ayurveda= Baba Hari Dass was one of the early proponents who helped bring Ayurveda to the US in the early 1970s, an ancient Indian system of health and healing. He taught combined classes in Ashtanga Yoga, Samkhya and Ayurveda as \\"sister sciences\\". As interest grew, the three-dosha theory, pulse detection, and ayurvedic medicum derived from the classic scriptures of the Sushruta Samhita and the Charaka Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, were introduced that led to the establishment of the Mount Madonna Institute, College of Ayurveda,http://www.mountmadonnainstitute.org/ayurveda/ayurveda_world.html Ayurveda World, and Ayurvedic pharmacy. He invited several notable Ayurvedic teachers, Dr. Vasant Lad, Sarita Shrestha, M.D., Professor Ram Harsh Singh, Ph.D, and others. Michael Tierra, Ayurvedic medicine practitioner, wrote: \\"The history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass\\" (The way of Ayurvedic Herbs, Lotus Press, 2008, p. XIV).Karta Purkh Singh Khalsa and Michael Tierra: \\"Independently, we both first learned Ayurvedic medicine from our respective spiritual mentors ‚Äì myself with Baba Hari Dass and K.P., with Yogi Bhajan.\\" (p.X); The way of Ayurvedic Herbs, Lotus Press, 2008, = Yoga Teachers Training = Following the tradition of non-sectarian teachings of Ashtanga Yoga, with the roots in practical Hatha yoga and the metaphysics of Samkhya, Baba Hari Dass inspired and supervised several programs with focus in training future yoga instructors. He first started teaching yoga in India as per existing accounts by Bhagavan DasBhagavan Das, It's Here Now, p. 44 in 1964, and by Ram DassRam Dass, Be Love Now, p.138 in 1965‚Äì66. By some other accounts, his teaching engagements occurred already in 1958 when he trained several former students of the known mystic George Gurdjieff (1866‚Äì1949). In the US and Canada, beginning in the mid 1970s, he created comprehensive teaching programs combining the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali. Those were grounded in the scriptural tradition of Hatha yoga system in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Siva Samhita, and Gherand Samita, Yoga Vashishta. With the emphasis on strength and flexibility he developed Fitness Asanas to increase physical endurance. Pranayama, a stable control and expansion of energy, was given prominence in focused support of meditation. Kirtan, mudras, the theory of gunas of Samkhya and the subtle body, or SukShma sharira of Tantra and Vedantic philosophy were also included. Regular and persistent practice (sadhana and Abhyasa) augmented scriptural references and emphasized experience through regular routine. In addition to core practices of Ashtanga Yoga, several less mainstream teachings are given during the formative stages of Yoga Teacher Training at Mount Madonna Center, Watsonville, CA. For example, Tantric Bhairavƒ´ Chakra Sadhana and The Vairagƒ´ Ritual is a circular yoga sƒÅdhana performed with an equal number of men and women that employs yantras to invoke the various forms of Devi, or Durga as the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition. Practices such as Shut Chakra Bedhana (piercing the chakras) and Yoni Mudra Japa are included. That sadhana used as the VairƒÅgƒ´ Vai·π£·πáavas practice does not have a sexual component. For yoga practitioners and teachers, who are inclined towards advanced practices, a seclusion and silence week-long practice is offered that can focus on deity worship, reading of holy scriptures, pujas and recitation of mantras. Over years, moderation, inclusiveness, and emphasis on regular practice of his yoga teachings led to the creation of a wider scope of yoga programs and retreats that are followed in several centers, in Mount Madonna Center in Watsonville, in Pacific Cultural Center in Santa Cruz; Salt Spring Centre of yoga, on Salt Spring Island BC., and in Dharma Sara Satsang, in Vancouver, BC., Canada. = Sri Ram Ashram = kids getting sweets, Sri Ram Ashram, Shyampur, India Baba Hari Dass in his travels through India encountered many abandoned children who were in need of home and a caring place. As a young boy Baba Hari Dass witnessed the mistreatment of children at an orphanage he visited with his friend. Prompted by that experience and using the proceeds from his yoga books and generous donations, \\"he established a loving home for children in need\\".\\"Jewel in the Jungle\\", DVD edition; Sri Ram Ashram Documentary by Rashmi Cole; Oceanview Bookstore, CA; 2005. One of his students, Ma Renu, inspired by the teachings of selfless service (karma yoga) traveled to India to launch in 1984 Sri Ram Ashram,Sri Ram Orphanage, founded in 1984; located in Uttaranchal, near the town of Haridwar; http://sriramfoundation.org/index.php/sri-ram-ashram a children's home, school, and medical clinic in rural location of the northern state of Uttaranchal. The Ashram, now located near Haridwar (Shyampur village) was established in 1987. From its inception, the focus became to support orphaned and destitute children. Some children find their way to Sri Ram Ashram by being brought and left at the entrance gate, or by being found abandoned in streets of towns, or rural places. After medical evaluation those children are brought into the new surroundings with care and loving attention. In 1987, Sri Ram Vidya Mandir became a nationally accredited school, which educates children, Nursery through 12th grade standard, from both the orphanage and nearby villages. Scriptural focus Baba Hari Dass with kids, Mount Madonna Center, May 2008 =The aim= Attainment of higher states of concentration according to Ashtanga Yoga (classical yoga of Patanjali) is rooted in development of the physical body (Hatha Yoga). \\"The body is a boat which carries the soul in the ocean of the world. If it is not strong, or if has a hole, then it can't cross the ocean. So the first duty is to fix the boat.\\" With the physical body gaining in strength and guided by a disciplined life, an adept can receive more refined instructions and teachings, called sadhana. Regular sadhana, according to Baba Hari Dass, is a key element of practice of yoga, and no matter what method is adopted sadhana becomes an anchor that can always be relied on. Baba Hari Dass, himself a monk all his life, considered people who are married as also capable of leading yogic life. Due to their daily care for children, a regular sadhana would take a form of Grihasta Yoga (householder yoga), \\"It is a union of two people in which they sacrifice their personal desires to become one.\\" =Yoga tradition of Dattatreya and Patanjali= Several authors hold that Dattatreya (\\"Datta son of Atri\\", also known as Datta Guru),http://www.shreeswami.org/dattatreya to whom Advahuta-Gita is ascribed (the fourth century C.E.), was the first who originated tradition of Ashtanga Yoga (astha-anga-yoga), or RƒÅja yoga (eight- fold path of Yoga). Dattatreya is also credited with the authorship of Jivan- Mukti-Gita (\\"Song of Living Liberation\\") that extols the adept who is liberated while still in the body, as well as Tripura-Rahasya (\\"Tripura's Secret Teaching\\").Feuerstein, p.23 Yoga, as a spiritual practice, most likely developed prior to the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in the same ascetic circles as the early sramana movements. Several Upanishads (Ranade, R. D., dating from the 1200 ‚Äì 600 BC), have particular relevance to the teachings of yoga (Katha, Prasna, Mundaka, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka, or Shvetasvtara).Ranade, R. D. (1926), A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Those writings predate Buddhist tradition of more formal yoga-practices described in the Buddhist Nikayas. Some authors, evaluating various opinions about the origin of Yoga, state that \\"It can certainly be argued that the germs of yogic thought can be found in embryonic form in the (middle period) Vedic literatures themselves, the Aranyakas and Brahmana texts\\" (most likely between c. 1500‚Äì1200 BC). Ascertaining various sources, Baba Hari Dass, composed his own in-depth commentary to The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali that elucidates difficult theoretical concepts with many years of experience and knowledge of practices of yoga. Some authors assert that Patajali's Yoga Sutras and Yoga practices in general \\"had been virtually forgotten for the better part of seven hundred years\\" until it was rehabilitated at the end of the nineteenth century by Swami Vivekananda. However, scriptural research may have to be evaluated in addition to localized Yoga traditions that rely on the word of mouth transfer of yogic knowledge and are centuries older in duration than indicated by the theoretical speculation. Building upon Himalayan Kumoan tradition of centuries old yoga development,Baba Hari Dass, 1975, Hariakhan Baba - Known, Unknown. Baba Hari Dass started his weekly Yoga Sutras of Patanjali classes at the University of California, at Santa Cruz, CA in 1975. Several commentaries and yoga classics were referenced, such as: Yoga Vashishta, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Shiva Samhita, Goraksha Samhita,Yoga Bhashya attributed to Veda Vyasa (probably the fifth C.E.); ƒ™≈õvarakrishna's Samkhyakarika (4th or 5th century CE); VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra's Tattvavai≈õƒÅradƒ´ (the ninth century C.E.); Yogavartika of Vijnanabhiksu (the sixteenth century C.E.); Swami Hariharananda Aranya's (1869‚Äì1947) Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali, and Pandit Usharbudh Arya's commentary (1986). In his exposition of the yoga principles, continued until 2012, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Ashtanga Yoga played a fundamental and formative role in educating yoga seekers. According to Baba Hari Dass, \\"Yogah means samadhi, or the state that occurs when mental modifications are controlled by persistent practice and dispassion.\\"Baba Hari Dass, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Vol I, 1999; p. 3 Patanjali's Yoga Sutras define the meaning of yoga as \\"Control of thought waves in the mind\\" (I:2), or as nirodha (mental control), \\"by which union (the goal of yoga) is achieved.\\" Nirodha is the process, while resultant niruddha is the state of perfection. The path that assumes dualistic individuality becomes the nondual state \\"characterized by the absence of individuality.\\" In that sense, the goal of yoga can be described \\"as eternal peace, pure love, Self-realization, or liberation\\", or as \\"a prescription for liberation from the cycle of suffering.\\"Baba Hari Dass, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Vol I, 1999; p. 2 Samadhi Pada (vol I), is an exposition of upaya, the primary means of yoga, together with the more advanced subject of the efficiency of practice abhyasa and dispassion (vairagya). Sadhana Pada (vol II) presents practical methods for the yogis who are aspiring to higher states of concentration and need to remove mental distractions (viksipta). Those practical methods constitute Kriya Yoga and make the mind ready for one- pointed concentration (ekagra-dhyana), which results in the steadiness of concentration, or samahita chitta. In Vibhuti Pada (vol III), pratyahara is further developed into concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and into the state of absorption samadhi. Those states, when mastered in succession are the foundation of samyama; \\"samyama is perfect control of mental concentration\\" (p. 7); and \\"The samyama is not complete unless there is a fusion of these three processes of concentration\\"; it should also be noted that the perfection of samyama constitutes \\"three internal limbs of concentration\\". Furthermore, Baba Hari Dass elucidates different aspects of samadhi and samyama and their resulting achievements in relation to viveka khyati, or discriminating faculty. Vol IV, Kaivalya Pada; the commentary to the last volume of Patanjali's Yoga Sutra was published in 2017. Ramayana theatrical production, costume preparation, 2003 =Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, and other writings= Among several Versions of Ramayana, a colorful musical stage performance by students trained by Baba Hari Dass, is the largest yearly, Western version of the epic being performed on stage. Ramayana in India is a stage performances throughout villages and towns. Young actors and participants assume different roles each year thus being able to play several characters over years. In the United States, Baba Hari Dass trained students of Mount Madonna School in Watsonville, California, to continue that tradition in annual musical in June (first performance in 1974); \\"The play has grown to be the widely anticipated annual school event of the year in which the entire school participates\\". He has taught acting arts, costume design, mask making and choreography to bring alive the characters of Sri Ram, Sita, Hanuman, Lakshmana, Shiva and Parvati, Vibhishan, Jatayu, Sugriva, Surpanakha, Ravana and his rakshasa court, Meghnaad, Kumbhakarna, and the army of monkeys and demons. \\"Although it predated Star Wars by a few thousand years 'Ramayana' invites comparisons to the George Lukas film both in storyline and in underlying theme.\\" Bhagavad Gita ‚Äì a commentary to Chapters 1‚Äì6 (Vol I, pub. 2013); the Bhagavad Gita uses a metaphor of a battle to convey the meaning of the inner struggle to attain knowledge of human condition. The struggle is between positive and negative tendencies. In this volume meaning of the three main types of yoga are articulated: Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga. The emphasis is given to the view that \\"action is superior to inaction\\" (p. 300). \\"Actions that are performed without self-interest and for the good of all are called sacrifice (yajna)\\"(p. 302), and those actions will not cause any bondage. Samkhya Karika and Vedanta: A commentary to Ishvara Krishna‚Äôs (Samkhyakarika) exposition of Samkhya principles of 24 tattva system that culminates in full recognition of the Self, recognition which brings about the separation of Purusha, conscious principle from Prakriti, unconscious material principle. In editing stages: a commentary to Vedantic classic Panchadasi of Swami Vidyaranya, the commentary includes discussion of several Vedantic schools: Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita, and Dvaita. Fifteen chapters deal with the discrimination of Sat, Chit, and Ananda aspects of the Truth.  Later events and Death  Baba Hari Dass, Mount Madonna Center, Watsonville, CA, around 2006 In 16 October 2013, after physical examination, it was announced by his medical team that Baba Hari Dass \\"had a dramatic neurological change that has affected his mobility, stamina, and expression\\", and \\"his physicians have conducted all appropriate tests and have not found any treatable cause.\\" At that time he discontinued his regular activities of teaching classes of Vedanta, Yoga Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, or attending ceremonial events. He did not resume his regular teaching schedule afterwards. He died in peace in hospice care at 10:32 a.m. on 25 September 2018, in Bonny Doon, near Santa Cruz, California. He was known and admired by local community. \\"He took his vow of perpetual silence in 1952, which he kept until his passing... Tuesday morning, a cremation ceremony was organized at Santa Cruz Memorial. It didn‚Äôt take long before hundreds of people began lining up to pay their respects\\" (Register Pajaronian, 27 September 2018). Santa Cruz Sentinel and San Jose Mercury News published front-page article Silent monk Baba Hari Dass, who inspired thousands at the Mount Madonna Center, dies at 95: \\"Baba Hari Dass, the spiritual leader and silent monk who inspired thousands out of the Mount Madonna Center north of Watsonville, died Tuesday morning in his Bonny Doon home. He was 95...he taught yoga and meditation out of the Watsonville retreat center and school after moving to the U.S. from India in 1971. Babaji took a vow of silence in 1952, conversing only through his writings and a small chalkboard from which he would dispense terse-yet- profound utterances to those who sought his advice. Asked once by a Sentinel reporter to describe himself, he wrote simply, 'I am what people see me as.' Asked how should one live a good life, he would reportedly respond, 'Work honestly, meditate every day, meet people without fear, and play.'‚ÄùBaba Hari Dass Shraddha ceremony, 7 Oct 2018 His departure from the physical form (mahƒÅsamadhi) took place during the month of Bhadrapad following Purnima (full Moon), on the first day of Krishna Paksha as per Lunar Indian calendar system. Sraddha ritual was performed lakeside, on the 12th day after his mahƒÅsamadhi, at Mount Madonna Center, Watsonville, California, on Sunday, 7 October. Santa Cruz Sentinel wrote: \\"About 1,500 people gathered Sunday morning at the Mount Madonna Center to commemorate Baba Hari Dass, the silent monk, teacher and guru... There were people of all ages in attendance Sunday, many wearing white, who came from the Santa Cruz area, as well as across the country and Canada to pay their respects to the man known to his students as Babaji. There was a serene, somber and intense atmosphere, with a combination of bells, chants and the sound of the wind filling the air.\\" San Francisco Chronicle noted: \\"In the last five years ...due to a deterioration in his health, ...the community has already become accustomed to his physical absence, but it remains to be seen what the impact of his passing will be.\\" His ashes were immersed in the Ganga at Har Ki Pauri, in Haridwar, one of the holiest sites in India, on 19 November 2018, with special puja and arati, on auspicious day of Ekadashi. \\"Originally we had planned to immerse the ashes at Asthi Pravah Ghat, where it is usually done, but at the last minute, the Har ki Pauri organization and pujari allowed us to perform the puja and immersion at Brahmakund, which is considered the most holy ghat in Haridwar, as it is where the Amrit fell.\\" Commentaries and literary works * The Yellow Book: The Sayings of Baba Hari Dass, 1974, Lama Foundation; First Edition; * Hariakhan Baba: Known, Unknown, 1975, Sri Rama Foundation, () * The Magic Gem ‚Äì A Story Coloring Book; 1976, Sri Rama Foundation; (Library of Congress 76-10032) * Silence Speaks: Aphorisms From the Chalkboard of Baba Hari Dass, Sri Rama Foundation, 1977, () * Ashtanga Yoga Primer, Illustrated Practical Guide, Sri Rama Publishing, 1977, () * A Child's Garden of Yoga, Sri Rama Publishing, 1980, () * Sweeper to Saint: Stories of Holy India, A Collection of short stories; Sri Rama Publishing, July 1980, () * Cat and Sparrow, Sri Rama Foundation, 1982, Santa Cruz, CA; () * Mystic Monkey, Sri Rama Publishing, Sri Rama Publishing,1984, () * Fire Without Fuel: The Aphorisms of Baba Hari Dass, Sri Rama Publishing, 1986, () * Essays on the Search for Peace in Daily Life, 1.

This record was later abridged by Mormon and inscribed onto gold plates from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon after an angel revealed to him the location where the plates were buried on a hill called Cumorah near the town of Palmyra, New York. Palaeographic study of the plates is not possible; according to Joseph Smith the plates were returned to an angel named Moroni, and are no longer in human possession. Origins According to the Book of Mormon prophet Nephi: \\"I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine own life.\\" Nephi's father, Lehi, was also a prophet who, after prophesying of the destruction of Jerusalem, left with members of his extended family around 600 BC and was eventually directed to the New World. Nephi was commanded to make two sets of plates: A small set of plates \\"for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people,\\" and \\"the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people.\\" These plates, as well as other records made and found by Nephi's people were handed down from generation to generation. Small plates After Nephi had begun the large plates, he was instructed by the Lord to make another set of plates to record \\"the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them.\\" These smaller plates were kept by Nephi's descendants until about 150 BC, when the prophet Amaleki delivered the plates to Benjamin, king of Zarahemla, who \\"put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings\\" (). Amaleki's last writing was the statement that the small plates were full () and from this point there were no further additions to the small plates. Mormon did not abridge the small plates of Nephi but he did include them in the records he gave to his son Moroni (). The first six books of the Book of Mormon, from First Nephi to Omni are said to be a translation of the small plates of Nephi. Large plates Full-scale model of the gold plates based on Joseph Smith's description Joseph Smith said the large plates of Nephi were continually maintained until about AD 385, when the prophet Mormon, seeing that the destruction of the Nephite nation was imminent, abridged the large plates of Nephi. This abridgement, with additions by Mormon's son, Moroni, was part of the set of gold plates Moroni delivered to Joseph Smith. The books within the Book of Mormon from The Words of Mormon to Fourth Nephi, are taken from Mormon's abridgment of the large plates. Although the large plates were intended for the more secular history of the Nephites, it is obvious from the version available in the Book of Mormon that there was a good deal of spiritual content as well, including sermons, prophecies and moral lessons. Some periods of time are covered in more detail than others, in particular a series of wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites in the Book of Alma. Whether the uneven coverage is a reflection of the original record or is an artifact of Mormon's abridgement is not clear from the text. =Book of Lehi= While recording his own history, Nephi mentioned \\"the record which has been kept by my father\\" in a few places. Nephi also mentioned that he had made an abridgement of the record of his father at the beginning of his own record. While translating the gold plates, Joseph Smith reluctantly allowed his associate, Martin Harris, to take the entirety of the translation to that point, 116 manuscript pages, to show to Harris's wife and her family, to convince them that his (Harris's) financial support of Smith was worthwhile. Although strictly charged to ensure its safety, Harris lost the manuscript. The lost portion, part of the large plates of Nephi, contained Nephi's record of his father, Lehi's, ministry and was known as The Book of Lehi. Joseph Smith recorded, in the Doctrine and Covenants, sections 3 and 10, that the Lord instructed him not to re-translate the portion of the book that was lost but to continue forward. In place of the lost Book of Lehi, the translation from the small plates of Nephi was used, which covered the same time period. Both Nephi () and Mormon () recorded that the small plates were made for a \\"wise purpose\\" that was known to the Lord. The aforementioned sections of the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C; 3, D&C; 10) state that the loss of the Book of Lehi was foreseen by the Lord and that it was for this purpose that the small plates were provided. Caretakers The angel Moroni delivering the plates of the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith. The Plates of Laban, Sword of Laban, the Plates of Nephi, Liahona, Plates of Ether, other records engraven on metal plates, and at least one record engraven upon stone were passed down from generation to generation. Each generation had one caretaker who was responsible for these items, mostly records; caretaker for more than their own record(s). Here is the list of caretakers, according to the Book of Mormon: *Nephi, son of Lehi -- The first caretaker of: Small and Large Plates of Nephi Plates and Sword of Laban -- Retrieved by Nephi and his brothers in the First Book of Nephi chapters 3 & 4 Record of Lehi *Jacob, son of Lehi -- Nephi's brother *Enos, son of Jacob *Jarom, son of Enos *Omni, son of Jarom *Amaron, son of Omni *Chemish, son of Omni -- brother of Amaron *Abinadom, son of Chemish *Amaleki, son of Abinadom Jaredite Record -- During the time of Mosiah, the Nephites fled to the land of Zarahemla and discovered the Mulekites who had found a stone tablet with writing on it. Mosiah interpreted the writings by the power of God, and it turned out to be a record of the people of Jared, more fully recorded in the Book of Ether. Amaleki was also the last to write on the Small Plates of Nephi. *King Benjamin, son of King Mosiah -- Amaleki wrote, \\"having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him.\\" *King Mosiah, son of King Benjamin -- Besides caretaking of the records, Mosiah added two sets of records returned by Ammon and the people of Zeniff: The Record of Zeniff Plates of Ether that had been recovered by the people of Zeniff. *Alma son of Alma *Helaman, son of Alma *Shiblon, son of Alma *Helaman, son of Helaman -- nephew of Shiblon *Nephi, son of Helaman -- No record of when he became the caretaker. *Nephi, son of Nephi *Amos, son of Nephi *Amos, son of Amos *Ammaron, son of Amos -- brother of Amos, son of Amos. \\"Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred‚Äîyea, even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred.\\" *Mormon, son of Mormon When Mormon was ten years old, Ammaron told him where to find the records that had been hidden. Mormon waited until he was twenty-four years old (as instructed) to retrieve the records.

Mount Taylor is part of the Canberra Nature Park and is surrounded by the suburbs of , , , , , and . There are walking tracks to the peak. While there is no public road access to the peak there is a fire trail up the mountain from the end of Waldock St, Chifley where there is also a car park and picnic tables. The fire trail (also known as the management trail) is normally closed to public vehicular access by locked gates, but the gates contain access points for walkers. The trail is especially popular with families and older walkers as it provides the easiest and most leisurely access to the peak. Originally a dirt road, it was partially sealed in 2009 on the steeper grades to make it safer for walkers and mountain bike riders. Facilities From the Tuggeranong (Kambah) side there is a popular foot trail up the mountain that can be accessed from a car parking area off Sulwood Drive. The carpark has recently been upgraded and was previously potholed and unsafe with numerous car accidents occurring. This foot track up the mountain can also be accessed from Gouger St, Torrens. Unlike the fire trail, this is a properly constructed reinforced footpath, concrete mostly but packed clay and fine, compacted gravel in other places. This track is longer and generally steeper than the fire trail making it especially popular among fitness enthusiasts who incorporate running up and down the track into their training routines. Dog owners also use the track to exercise their pets. Part of the track follows the 750m contour line and there are rest benches along the way. It is very picturesque, passing through a heavily treed area near the summit and there are steps in this vicinity due to the steepness. Near the summit, the foot track from Tuggeranong merges into the sealed fire trail coming from the Woden side. On the north face of the mountain is the zig-zag track to the summit (Mount Taylor Walking Track) which was constructed in 2007. This foot trail has signs containing historic photos and information about wildlife at each change of direction. After the first change of direction the track passes through a grove of Casuarina trees. Three quarters of the way along is a seat made of railway sleepers. Near the summit the track passes over a small rocky outcrop with natural steps made of rocks. This track replaced the almost vertical rough track up the mountain (The Richmond Fellowship Track) which was by far the most difficult route, remnants of which can still be seen from a distance. An attempt was made in the early 1990s to make that track safer as part of a project by long-term unemployed under the guidance of the Richmond Fellowship. Steps consisting of restraining planks of wood were installed and on the top step was a sign saying \\"You made it!\\" Unfortunately the track suffered bad erosion due to wet weather and the steep incline, and the steps became unsafe and a public liability risk with holes appearing. The zig-zag track is reinforced and far safer and, although longer, provides an easier and more leisurely walk to the summit. There is a fourth track to the summit on the eastern face of the mountain. A less formed, rougher track and very steep proceeding almost vertically to the summit from the water supply reservoir on Hawker St, Torrens. Because of its steepness and challenge, many of the walkers who were disenfranchised when the Richmond Fellowship Track was closed in 2007 now use this track. About halfway along it passes near an area known as The Sandpit, an almost circular erosion gully which appeared after heavy rains in 1969. With the passage of time nature has reclaimed part of the area, but it can still be seen from a distance. Near the summit the track passes a power pole which was installed in the mid 1970s to provide electricity to the National Transmission Station on the summit. At the top of Mount Taylor there is a trig point, a National Transmission Station to relay television and FM radio to the Tuggeranong valley and parts of Woden/Weston Creek, and also two bench seats and two panoramic maps, one facing Woden and the other facing Tuggeranong. History Mount Taylor was named after James Taylor, an early squatter in the district prior to 1829. An early map entitled Survey of part of the Morombidgee and Country South of Lake George by Surveyor White shows Taylor's huts close to the site of Yarralumla homestead. Taylor was a son-in-law of Colonel George Johnston who commanded the New South Wales Corps, which deposed Governor William Bligh during the Rum Rebellion of 1808. Mount Taylor was originally named Taylor's Hill but was renamed Mount Taylor during the early years of Canberra. Wildlife The vulnerable Pink-tailed Worm-lizard occurs on Mount Taylor Mount Taylor is listed on the Register of the National Estate as the most prominent landmark in southern Canberra, and together with nearby Oakey Hill, Wanniassa Hills and Isaacs Ridge, is valued as a key part of the landscape of Canberra. It contains one of the most significant populations known of the nationally endangered Pink-tailed Legless Lizard, Aprasia parapulchella and a nationally endangered plant, the Small Purple-pea Swainsona recta. It also provides examples of two nationally endangered communities - Eucalyptus melliodora ‚Äî E blakelyi woodland community, and the lowland temperate grassland community - plus a regionally significant vegetational transitional stage, between dry sclerophyll forest and woodland. A Mount Taylor park care group was established in 1989. It assists in weed removal, monitors the bird population and provides guides to the reserve. Over 85 species of birds have been identified on the hill and nearby. Geology and geography Mount Taylor is elongated in the north-northwest direction. This is parallel with the general direction of the Murumbidgee River. A ridge extends northwards to Oakey Hill. This separates the Woden Valley from Weston Creek. Another ridge extends from the south east and curves around to the east forming Farrer Ridge. Drainage from the east goes into Yarralumla Creek in the Woden Valley. On the west and south side runoff goes into Village Creek in Kambah. The rocks on Mount Taylor are from the Silurian age from 420 million years ago. They are acid volcanic rocks. On the top and western sides is a rock called ignimbrite. This was formed by massive volcanic explosions that ejected hot volcanic particles in the air that then fell to the ground. This collection of rocks is known as the Laidlaw Volcanics. On the northern slopes and lower eastern slopes the rock is rhyodacite. This is from the Deakin Volcanics. There is also a sill of porphyry intruded into the volcanic rocks on the east and south slopes. The rocks dip to the south west at an angle of 20¬∞. This dip is perpendicular to the long extension of the mountain, showing that it is the strata in the rock that has determined the shape of the mountain. Human changes The Tuggeranong Parkway forms a boundary to the nature park in the northwest. Sulwood Drive forms the southwest and southern boundary of the park. In the east, houses have backyards backing onto the park in Torrens, Pearce, and Chifley. Waldock Street provides access to the north end of the mount. High voltage power lines run around the west and south of the hill connecting the Lyons and Wanniassa substations. There is a horse riding trail along the back of Woden Valley, connecting to the horse holding paddock on the southeast ridge of Mount Taylor. There are several water supply reservoirs on the hill behind the suburbs. Following the Australia Day 1971 flood, a floodway was constructed at the base of the mountain above the boundary line to protect properties in Pearce and Torrens from flood waters. During the late 1960s and early 1970s while the original fences remained in place the former land holder in the Woden area prior to development was allowed to graze his sheep on part of the mountain. This practice ended when the mountain reserve became part of Canberra Nature Park.

It offers online news articles in Hebrew, English, and Russian as well as live streaming radio, video and free podcasts. It also publishes a weekly newspaper, B'Sheva, with the third-largest weekend circulation in the country. History In the 1970s an offshore radio station Voice of Peace was launched, broadcasting pacifistic messages. In response, Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed launched radio station Arutz Sheva in 1988, aimed at Israelis opposed to negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Based in Beit El, the station generated its broadcast on the Israeli airwaves from the ship MV Eretz HaTzvi in the Mediterranean Sea. It was one of the first Internet radio stations and was used as a beta tester for RealPlayer. From 1996 to 2002, Arutz Sheva broadcast in Russian. In 2003, Arutz Sheva ceased its radio operations after attempts to legalize it were unsuccessful. In 2020, Reuters reported that Arutz Sheva along with Algemeiner, The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post had published op-eds written by non-existent people. Legal dispute In February 1999, the Knesset passed a law granting a license to Arutz Sheva and absolving it of earlier illegal broadcasting, but this was appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel, which ruled the law null and void in March 2002. In October 2003, ten employees of Arutz Sheva were convicted of operating an illegal radio station during the period 1995‚Äì98, both from inside Israeli territorial waters and from Beit El. The defendants were fined and sentenced to 3‚Äì6 months of community service. The prosecution appealed, attempting to get heavier sentences, but were strongly criticized by the appellate court for their handling of the case, and the prosecution was told to drop the appeal or face an investigation into their conduct during the entire trial. Station director Ya'akov \\"Katzele\\" Katz was also convicted on two counts of perjury for having lied about the location of the broadcasts. In 2006, Katz was pardoned by President Moshe Katsav. Departments =Internet= Arutz Sheva has been running its website since 1995. Editor-in-chief is Uzi Baruch, who succeeded Baruch Gordon and Hillel Fendel. Today, three versions of the site are offered: Hebrew, English and Russian. It includes news articles, news briefs, videos, op-eds, a Judaism section, opinion polls and caricatures. Arutz Sheva offers online streaming videos in Hebrew and English with news anchor and producer Yoni Kempinski, Knesset reporter Hezki Ezra, overseas correspondent Eliran Aharon and others.

The exhausted bee left the mantis on a floating flower but planted a seed in the mantis's body before it died. The seed grew to become the first human. In Egyptian mythology, bees grew from the tears of the sun god Ra when they landed on the desert sand. Maya vessel The Baganda people of Uganda hold the legend of Kintu, the first man on earth. Save for his cow, Kintu lived alone. One day he asked permission from Ggulu, who lived in heaven, to marry his daughter Nambi. Ggulu set Kintu on a trial of five tests to pass before he would agree. For his final test Kintu was told to pick Ggulu's own cow from a stretch of cattle. Nambi aided Kintu in the final test by transforming herself into a bee, whispering into his ear to choose the one whose horn she landed upon. In Greek mythology, Aristaeus was the god of bee- keeping. After inadvertently causing the death of Eurydice, who stepped upon a snake while fleeing him, her nymph sisters punished him by killing every one of his bees. Witnessing the empty hives where his bees had dwelt, Aristaeus wept and consulted Proteus who advised him to give honor in memory of Eurydice by sacrificing four bulls and four cows. Upon doing so, he let them rot and from their corpses rose bees to fill his empty hives. According to Hittite mythology, the god of agriculture, Telipinu, went on a rampage and refused to allow anything to grow and animals would not produce offspring. The gods went in search of Telipinu only to fail. Then the goddess ·∏™anna·∏´anna sent forth a bee to bring him back. The bee finds Telipinu, stings him and smears wax upon him. The god grew even angrier and it wasn't until the goddess Kamrusepa (or a mortal priest according to some references) uses a ritual to send his anger to the Underworld. In Hindu mythology, Parvati was summoned by the Gods to kill the demon Arunasura, who took over the heavens and the three worlds, in the form of Bhramari Devi. To kill Arunasura, she stings him numerous times with the help of innumerable black bees emerging from her body. The Gods were finally able to take control of the heavens and the celestial worlds again. Also, the bowstring on Hindu love god Kamadeva's bow is made of sugarcane, covered in bees. In Mayan mythology, Ah-Muzen-Cab is one of the Maya gods of bees and honey. Notes References * Harrison, Jane Ellen, (1903) 1922.

They are sometimes made for scientific purposes (the collection of glass flowers at Harvard University, for example, illustrates the flora of the United States). Artificial plants vary widely from mass-produced varieties that are distinguishable from real plants by casual observation to highly detailed botanical or artistic specimens. Materials used in their manufacture have included painted linen and shavings of stained horn in ancient Egypt, gold and silver in ancient Rome, rice-paper in China, silkworm cocoons in Italy, colored feathers in South America, and wax and tinted shells. Modern techniques involve carved or formed soap, nylon netting stretched over wire frames, ground clay, and mass-produced injection plastic mouldings. Polyester has been the main material for manufacturing artificial flowers since the 1970s. Most artificial flowers in the market nowadays are made of polyester fabric. Production The industry is now highly specialized with several different manufacturing processes. Hundreds of artificial flower factories in the Pearl River delta area of Guangdong province in China have been built since the early 1980s. Thousands of 40-foot containers of polyester flowers and plants are exported to many countries every year. =Polyester and paper= Paper flowers Five main processes may be distinguished: * The first step consists of putting the polyester fabric in gelatine in order to stiffen it. * The second consists of cutting up the various polyester fabrics and materials employed into shapes suitable for forming the leaves, petals, etc.; this may be done with scissors, but is more often done with stamps that can cut through a dozen or more thicknesses at one blow. * Next, the veins of the leaves are impressed by means of silk screen printing with a dye, and the petals are given their natural rounded forms by goffering irons of various shapes. * The next step is to assemble the petals and other parts of the flower, which is built up from the center outwards.Flower bouquet with prepared rose blossoms and silk flowers * The fifth is to mount the flower on a stalk of brass or iron wire wrapped with suitably colored material, and to add the leaves to complete the spray. While the material most often used to make artificial flowers is polyester fabric, both paper and cloth flowers are also made with origami. =Nylon stocking flowers= The art of nylon flower making is an easy to learn craft which uses simple tools and inexpensive material to achieve stunning results. Nylon flower making enjoyed a brief popularity in the United States in the 1970s and soon became very popular in Japan. In recent years, the craft's popularity has spread Asia, Europe and Australia. With the advent of new colors and materials, the art has expanded to infinite new possibilities of nylon flower making. The basic materials needed to make nylon flowers include: wire, stem wire, nylon stocking, nylon threading, floral tape and stamen. Some flowers require cotton balls or sheets (or batting), white glue, acrylic paint and paint brushes. =Silk flowers= Silk flowers are crafted from a protein fiber spun by the silk worm, producing lifelike flowers. Flowers described as being made of silk with a \\"real touch technique\\" are not made of silk, but rather are made of polyester, polymers and plastics. Moreover, textile items made of polyester but marketed as \\"silk\\" violate the US federal law - specifically the 1959 TEXTILE FIBER PRODUCTS IDENTIFICATION ACT. =Soap= There are two methods: * Carved: A bar with layered colored soap is mounted in a lathe, and circular grooves are chiseled into it. The finished flower is symmetric and regular, but the flowers are not identical and can be called handmade. * Molded: An oil-less soap milled to a powder is mixed with water, and the paste is used as a modelling material. Leaf and petal textures are stamped or rolled onto the soap. This is an expensive, labour-intensive process. =Clay= Clay flowers are made by hand from special air-dry polymer clay or cold porcelain, steel wire, paint, glue, tape and sometimes paper and foam as a filler. With the help of cutters, where each flower has its own cutter set, the parts are cut from the still soft clay and then formed with specially designed tools. After drying, these parts are, when needed, painted with precision and then very precisely assembled into a whole flower. When made by a skillful artisan, clay flowers can be very realistic. From Thailand, where this art is very popular, it has spread to Europe, Russia and the US. =Glass= Glass is melted and blown by hand into flower shapes. Working with glass at high temperatures to form a flower is very difficult, which is why glass flowers are much more expensive than typical artificial flowers. =Plastic= Injection moulding is used for mass manufacture of plastic flowers. Plastic is injected into a preformed metal die. Simulacraceae The journal Ethnobotany Research and Applications published a tongue-in-cheek paper that claims to be the culmination of a six- year project in the exhaustive taxonomy of artificial plants, and lumped the group into a single family called the Simulacraceae (\\"the family of simulated plants\\"). History Floral wreaths made by the ancient Egyptians were formed from thin plates of horn stained in different colors. They also sometimes consisted of leaves of copper, gilt or were silvered over. The ancient Romans excelled in the art of imitating flowers in wax and in this branch of the art attained a degree of perfection which has not been approached in modern times. Crassus, renowned for his wealth, gave to the victors in the games he celebrated at Rome crowns of artificial leaves made of gold and silver. In more recent times, Italians were the first to acquire celebrity for the skill and taste they displayed in this manufacture. Later English, American, and especially French manufactures were celebrated. The Chinese and Japanese show great dexterity in this work. These early artificial flowers were made out of many-colored ribbons which were twisted together and attached to small pieces of wire. But these first attempts were decidedly crude. In the first half of the 19th century, the Swedish artist Emma F√ºrstenhoff became internationally renowned in Europe for her artificial flower arrangements of Wax in a technique regarded as a novelty in contemporary Europe. In the 20th century, Colefax & Fowler, through Constance Spry, developed and promoted an exquisite, though expensive, method of manufacturing wax-coated faux flowers, which was based upon the Victorian invention of paraffin-coated wax flowers. In course of time feathers were substituted for ribbons, a more delicate material, but one to which it was not so easy to give the requisite shades of color. The plumage of the birds of South America was adapted for artificial flowers on account of the brilliancy and permanence of the tints, and the natives of that continent long practised with success the making of feather flowers. The London Zoo contains a collection of artificial flowers made out of the feathers of hummingbirds.

Here started the intra moenia portion of via Labicana. Via Labicana (shown in red) The Via Labicana was an ancient road of Italy, leading east-southeast from Rome. It seems possible that the road at first led to Tusculum, that it was then extended to Labici, and later still became a road for through traffic; it may even have superseded the Via Latina as a route to the southeast, for, while the distance from Rome to their main junction at Ad Bivium (or to another junction at Compitum Anagninum) is practically identical, the summit level of the former is lower than that of the latter, a little to the west of the pass of Mount Algidus. After their junction it is probable that the road bore the name Via Latina rather than Via Labicana.

Arrest Al Naimi has stated that he was abducted by Pashtun tribesmen in Afghanistan in late 2001, and then handed over to the Pakistani authorities in return for a cash reward. After being moved around for a while he eventually arrived at a prison at Kohat. After several more weeks he was transferred to American custody and flown to Guantanamo Bay. Inconsistent identification Abdulla Majid Al Naimi was identified inconsistently on official Department of Defense documents: * He was identified as Abdullah al Noaimi on the official list of captives' names published on May 15, 2006. * He was identified as Abdullah Majed Sayyah Hasan Alnoaimi on the official list of captives whose habeas corpus petitions should be dismissed following their transfer from US custody. Press reports transliterate his name as \\"Abdullah Al Nuaimi\\". =Witness statements= The documents the Department of Defense released include two statements, both dated November 11, 2004. One statement was from Mohammed Salman Al-Khalifa, a cousin of Salman Al Khalifa, a member of the Bahrain royal family. It states since Abdullah Al Noaimi was a childhood friend of Salman Al Khalifa he was asked to travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan to look for him, when he went missing, in August 2001. The other statement is from Mohamad Suleiman Alkaleifa, a childhood friend who testified to his good character, and lack of interest in politics. If his Board considered these witness statements then it was redacted from their recommendations. Abdullah Al Noaimi v. George Walker Bush A writ of habeas corpus was submitted on Abdullah Al Noaimi's behalf. The Department of Defense released a dossier of 24 pages of documents arising from his CSR Tribunal on December 9, 2004. = Administrative Review Board = Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. =Summary of Evidence memo= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Abdullah Al Noaimi's Administrative Review Board, on July 1, 2005. The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. There is no record that Al Noaimi participated in his Board hearing. =Board recommendations= In early September 2007, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to Gordon J. England, the Designated Civilian Official. The Board's recommendation was unanimous. The Board's recommendation was redacted. England authorized his transfer on October 4, 2005. Release Represented by attorney Joshua Colangelo-Bryan, Al-Naimi was one of three Bahraini detainees released and sent back to Bahrain in November 2005. Bahraini Member of Parliament Mohammed Khalid had called for the Bahrain government to provide financial compensation to the released men. Comments on the June 10, 2006 suicides The deaths of three detainees were announced on June 10, 2006. Al Naimi knew the three men, and commented on their deaths on June 25, 2006. Al Naimi said that Mani Al-Utaybi and Ali Abdullah Ahmed were captured while studying in Pakistan. He said that they were interrogated for only a brief time after their arrival in Guantanamo, and their interrogators had told them they were not regarded as a threat, and that they could expect to be released. > The interrogations dealt with them only during the first month of their > detention. For more than a year before I left Guantanamo in November 2005, > they were left alone. But they were still held in bad conditions in the camp > by the guards. Al Naimi also said that the third dead man, Yasser Talal Al Zahrani, was only 16 when he was captured, and should have been treated as a minor. > He was 21 when he died, barely the legal age in most countries, and was > merely 16 when he was picked up four and half years ago.

Saudi arrest Picture of Abdulla Majed Al Noaimi held by a protesting child in 2012. The Gulf Daily News reported that Al Naimi had been arrested in Saudi Arabia in late October 2008. Bahraini Member of Parliament Mohammed Khalid expressed dismay at the arrest of a third Bahraini citizen by Saudi authorities, and said that the Saudis had not offered a formal justification for his arrest. In late November 2008, another Bahraini in extrajudicial detention in Saudi Arabia, Khalil Janahi, was reported to have been repatriated. Mohammed Janahi described Khalid Janahi's repatriation as a hopeful development for Al Naimi, and two other Bahrainis in extrajudicial detention in Saudi Arabia - Abdulraheem Al Murbati, and Hassan Al Yabis. Al Naimi and the other men remained held by Saudi Arabia in April 2009. On August 2, 2010, Newsblaze reported on an incident where Bahraini police had been recorded beating a Saudi citizen. Newsblaze speculated that Saudi officials had not complained about the incident because Saudi Arabia did not want to explain its detention of Naomi, Khalil Janahi, and Abdurrahim Al Murbati. Al Noaimi was eventually released by the Saudis without charge and returned to Bahrain on April 21, 2016. Pentagon claim he had \\"returned to the fight\\" A 2009 article in the New York Times claimed that a Pentagon report \\"confirmed\\" that Al Noaimi had \\"returned to the fight\\" and had engaged in terrorist activity after his release from Guantanamo Bay in 2005.

It is located at Kavalur in the Javadi Hills, near Vaniyambadi in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is 200 km south-west of Chennai and 175 km south-east of Bangalore. History The Vainu Bappu Observatory of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics traces its origin back to 1786 when William Petrie set up his private observatory at his garden house at Egmore, Madras, which eventually came to be known as the Madras Observatory. Later it was moved to Kodaikanal and functioned there as the Kodaikanal Observatory since 1899. However, Kodaikanal had very few nights available for observation and hence astronomers searched for a new site after India's independence. M.K. Vainu Bappu who took over as the director of the Kodaikanal Observatory in 1960, found a sleepy little hamlet called Kavalur in the Javadi Hills as a suitable site for establishing optical telescopes for observing celestial objects. This came to be known as Kavalur Observatory. Observations began in 1968 with a 38 cm telescope made in the backyard of the Kodaikanal Observatory. Location Kavalur observatory is located in Kavalur in the Javadi Hills in Alangayam. The Kavalur Observatory is located in a 100-acre forest land in Tamil Nadu which is strewn with a variety of greenery of tropical region besides a number of medicinal plants with an occasional appearance of some wildlife like deer, snakes and scorpions. Several varieties of birds have also been spotted in the campus. The observatory is at an altitude of 725m above mean sea level (longitude 78¬∞ 49.6' E ; latitude 12¬∞ 34.6' N). Apart from being reasonably away from city lights and industrial areas, the location has been chosen in order to be closer to the earth's equator for covering both northern and southern hemispheres with equal ease. In addition, its longitudinal position is such that it is the only major astronomical facility between Australia and South Africa for observing the southern objects. Initial setup The first telescope was of 38 cm (15-inch) aperture, with which astronomical observations were started in 1968 at Kavalur Observatory. The 75 cm (30-inch) telescope has been completely designed and fabricated at the workshops of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. In 1972 a 1-metre (40-inch) telescope made by Carl Zeiss Jena was installed at Kavalur. 2.3-metre Vainu Bappu Telescope Vainu Bappu started the 2.3-metre (93-inch) aperture telescope, designed and built within the country. Bappu died in 1982 and would not see the completion of the telescope. On 6 January 1986, the observatory was renamed as Vainu Bappu Observatory and the 2.3-metre telescope as Vainu Bappu Telescope. The telescope is so powerful that it can easily resolve a 25 paise coin kept forty kilometres away. Deep sky observations are carried out with this telescope using a variety of focal plane instruments. The equatorially mounted horse-shoe-yoke structure of the telescope is ideally suited for low latitudes and permits easy observation near the north celestial pole. The telescope has a F/3.25 paraboloid primary of 2.3 m diameter with the prime focus image scale of 27 arcsec/mm and a Cassegrain focus image scale of 6.7 arcsec/mm. This telescope has been operated as a national facility and attracts proposals from all over the country and sometimes from outside India. Equipment The observatory is home to the Vainu Bappu Telescope, the largest telescope in Asia until a 3.6-meter telescope was set up at Devasthal, Nainital, by ARIES. It has a diameter of 2.3 meters and was first used in 1986. Along with the Vainu Bappu telescope, the observatory has two other telescopes: A 1-meter Zeiss manufactured and another 75-centimeter Cassegrain reflector currently being refurbished. The observatory also has a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer. * Technical details  Primary mirror diameter: 234 cm  Prime focus: f/3.25 with a scale of 27\\".1/mm  Cassegrain focus: f/13 with a scale of 6\\".8/mm  Guiding: remote, manual guiding * Instruments available  At PRIME focus: * Imaging camera with a 3-element Wynne corrector * High-resolution Echelle spectrograph * Detector  4096√ó4096 pixels TEK CCD, with a pixel size of 12 micrometres  At CASSEGRAIN focus: * Medium-resolution spectroploarimeter * Medium-resolution Optometrics Research spectrograph (OMRS) * Detector  1024√ó1024 pixels TEK CCD, with a pixel size of 24 micrometres Discoveries The 1-metre telescope is associated with two unique discoveries in the solar system. In 1972, atmosphere was detected around Jupiter's satellite Ganymede and in the year 1977, participated in the observations that confirmed rings were discovered around the planet Uranus. In 1984, Kavalur reported the discovery of a thin outer ring around Saturn. On 17 February 1988, a new minor planet was discovered using the 45 cm Schmidt telescope. It has been named 4130 Ramanujan after the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan. This is the first such discovery from India in the 20th century. Scientific activities Front-line research is being carried out with the help of the optical telescopes at Vainu Bappu Observatory using several focal plane instrumentational facilities. The ongoing programmes include observations of stars, star clusters, novae, supernovae, blazars, galaxies, optical imaging of gamma-ray burst fields, stellar populations, solar system objects and many others. The telescopes at the observatory had started with relatively modest focal plane instruments and later on graduated to more sophisticated ones. These include cameras for fast photography, photoelectric photometers, a single-channel photoelectric spectrum scanner, a medium resolution spectrograph, a quartz-prism calibration spectrograph, infrared photometer, image tube spectrograph, a Universal Astronomical Grating Spectrograph (UAGS from Zeiss), high-resolution echelle spectrograph and a polarimeter. Photographic plates were the principal detectors in the early days. Presently the charge-coupled devices (CCD) have replaced the photographic plates. Some micro-processor-controlled photon counting systems were designed and fabricated which have been used in a variety of observational projects. A fibre linked echelle spectrograph is under construction. On campus maintenance facilities like aluminising plants for coating the telescope mirrors, mechanical and electrical workshops, electronics labs, along with a liquid nitrogen plant are at hand for the smooth functioning of the observatory. Highly advanced technical facilities like SUN workstations are available at the telescopes for handling the CCD data, along with specialised data reduction packages such as IRAF, STSDAS and DAOPHOT. Communication facilities, like e-mail via VSAT satellite connection, are available for all users for the telescopes. A programme of ultraflow dispersion spectroscopy was successfully used to survey stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Of the ten supernovae observed so far, SN1987A in LMC was observed in great detail using the 1 m and the 75 cm telescopes despite its low elevation in the southern sky, proving the worth of the geographic location of Kavalur. In fact the observations of the supernova were started within 48 hours of the discovery. Observational studies of evolved stars, in particular studies related to their evolutionary aspects, carried out at this observatory, have received critical acclaim and international recognition. The observational facilities at this Observatory have yielded many PhD theses for the scholars of the Institute as well as of other institutes and universities in the country.

Video. A worker beginning to scabble a concrete foundation prior to installing grout for an equipment skid. Closeup of scabbled concrete during the process of preparing a foundation for grouting under a new equipment skid. Scabbling‚Äîalso called scappling‚Äîis the process of reducing stone or concrete. In masonry, it refers to shaping a stone to a rough square by use of an axe or hammer. In Kent, rag-stone masons call this \\"knobbling\\". It was similarly used to shape grindstones. In modern construction, scabbling is a mechanical process of removing a thin layer of concrete from a structure, typically achieved by compressed air powered machines. A typical scabbling machine uses several heads, each with several carbide or steel tips that peck at the concrete. It operates by pounding a number of tipped rods down onto the concrete surface in rapid succession. It takes several passes with the machine to achieve the desired depth. Scabbling is used to remove road markings, surface contamination (used in the nuclear industry), to add a decorative or textured pattern to concrete, or to prepare a concrete surface prior to the installation of grout.

It lies in the basin of the Paran√° River, covering portions of central Paraguay and northern Argentina, and with a small portion extending into southwestern Brazil. The natural vegetation is a mosaic of grasslands, palm savanna, and forest. Geography The Humid Chaco lies in the lowlands of the Paran√° river and its tributaries, including the Paraguay River. It is bounded on the west by the Dry Chaco, a semi-arid region of dry forests and savannas. The Alto Paran√° Atlantic forests lie to the east, and the Cerrado grasslands to the northeast. It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paran√° flooded savanna along the lower Paran√° and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paran√° and Uruguay rivers. The topography is generally flat or gently rising, and the soils are mostly fine alluvium deposited by the area's rivers. Asuncion, Paraguay's capital, lies in the ecoregion. Climate The climate is tropical, becoming subtropical towards the south. Average annual rainfall generally decreases towards the west, and ranges from 1,300 mm in the wetter eastern portions to 750 mm in the west near the transition to the Dry Chaco. Rainfall is highest in the summer months (January to April) and lowest in the winter months (June to August). Flora The flora is a mosaic of grassland, savanna, forests, and bogs. Grasslands and savannas are generally found on higher ground, and forests along streams and in river floodplains. Bogs form seasonally or year-round over impermeable soil layers. Grasslands are characterized by tall, coarse grass. Palm savannas are common, including the palm Copernicia alba. The most common trees in the forests are quebracho colorado (Schinopsis balansae) and quebracho blanco (Aspidosperma quebracho- blanco), together with guayac√°n (Caesalpinia paraguariensis), espina corona (Gleditsia amorphoides), urunday (Astronium balansae), virar√≥ (Ruprechtia laxiflora), palo piedra (Diplokeleba floribunda), guayaib√≠ (Patagonula americana), zapallo caspini (Pisonia zapallo), lapacho negro (Tabebuia ipe), palo borracho del flor rosada (Chorisia speciosa), and itin (Prosopis kuntzei).

The museum, which opened in 2003, is situated on the banks of the Hudson River in Beacon, New York. Dia Beacon's facility, the Riggio Galleries, is a former Nabisco box-printing facility that was renovated by Dia with artist Robert Irwin and architects Alan Koch, Lyn Rice, Galia Solomonoff, and Linda Taalman, then of OpenOffice. Along with Dia's permanent collection, Dia Beacon also presents temporary exhibitions, as well as public programs designed to complement the collection and exhibitions, including monthly Gallery Talks, Merce Cunningham Dance Company Events, Community Free Days for neighboring counties, and an education program that serves area students at all levels.

Overview Dia pioneered the conversion of industrial buildings for the installation of contemporary art, a practice and aesthetic now widely adopted by museums and galleries internationally. Dia's most recent conversion, its museum in Beacon, is located in a former printing plant built in 1929 by Nabisco (National Biscuit Company). The museum is sited on thirty-one acres near the banks of the Hudson River, and is adjacent to ninety acres of riverfront parkland. It is a five-minute walk from the Metro- North train station in Beacon, 60 miles (80 minutes by train) north of New York City. Dia Beacon's expansive spaces are well suited to the needs of large-scale installations, paintings, and sculptures. In keeping with Dia's history of single-artist, site-related presentations, each gallery was designed specifically for the art it contains. This includes Andy Warhol's 1978‚Äì79 multipart work Shadows, displayed in a single installation measuring approximately 350 linear feet; selections from Dan Flavin's series of fluorescent light Monuments to V. Tatlin (1964‚Äì81); Richard Serra's monumental steel sculptures, Torqued Ellipses; and Michael Heizer's North, East, South, West (1967/2002). The ideal viewing conditions created by reflected north light from more than of skylights are especially evident in the galleries devoted to the paintings of On Kawara, Agnes Martin, Blinky Palermo, and Robert Ryman. Dia collaborated with American artist Robert Irwin and architect OpenOffice to formulate the plan for the museum building and its exterior setting.

While service plans resemble extended warranties, there are several important differences between the two, often cited by retailers that sell them. Differences from warranties A service plan is a separate policy from the manufacturer's warranty. While the typical service plan does require preventative and routine maintenance to be taken in accordance with the manufacturer's warranty, it does not actually require a product to fail or malfunction under the same conditions. Service plans are also active from the date of purchase, unlike extended warranties, which become active when the manufacturer's warranty expires, meaning products can be purchased with service plans that is before or at the same time as the manufacturer's warranty. The key distinction is that a warranty strictly covers defects in workmanship and materials, while service plans cover product failure in general with a list of exclusions. While the exclusion list includes most situations that would disqualify a product from warranty coverage, there are things that fall outside the product's condition that aren't excluded, such as power surges. However, this is offset by the infrequency of covered conditions, and misinterpretation. For example, a lightning strike is considered an environmental cause, and consequently is excluded from most service plans, even if they claim power surge protection. To help differentiate from manufacturer's warranties, service plans occasionally come with additional benefits, such coverage for theft or accidental damage, replacements if a product fails a given number of times (\\"no lemon policy\\"), access to additional services, priority service and technical support. Methods of service Service plans vary in how an item is serviced. Some items may be serviced by the retailer's technicians, some may be sent out for repair, some may ship a replacement to the customer, some may be replaced by the retailer with a new item from the store inventory, or exchanged for store credit. Generally, if an item can be serviced in-store by the retailer, it will be. Some items like home theater equipment are repaired on-site with the retailer covering the cost. If the product can't be serviced by local technicians, then the items are sent to the manufacturer to be serviced. If the item is not serviceable or service is too expensive, the retailer will simply replace the product, or issue store credit for a newer model. Economics Whether an extended service plan is worth the extra cost depends on the item and the perceived value by the consumer. Basic service plans on desktop computers, for example, typically come close to the actual average repair cost of a system, with the retailer using the service plan as a way to keep the customer from going to a competing service center. Support options can be beneficial to consumers who are unfamiliar with the use and maintenance of a computer. Replacement options may present an advantage over an RMA if the customer is disrupted enough by a product's absence (such as computer upgrades), but the low failure rate of the products and the ability to buy temporary substitutes usually offsets the price. Some items such as low-end headphones may consistently fail before the end of the coverage period, which can be advantageous. Presence among retailers Service plans are seen mainly in office stores and electronics retailers, largely because of perceived fragility of electronics hardware and insecurity over the use of refurbished product. Some items such as computers and sale items produce very little profit for retailers, so selling service plans and accessories is essential to profiting from the transaction (see Loss leader). In these cases, service plans are usually bundled with additional high-margin services, such as phone support, at reduced prices to add to the perceived value of purchasing them. Some retailers that offer service plans include Sears (Master/Repair Protection Agreement/Merchandise Replacement Agreement), OfficeMax (MaxAssurance Warranty Plan), Best Buy (Geek Squad Protection), CompUSA (Technology Assurance Program), hhgregg, Office Depot (Performance Protection Plan), Radio Shack(Replacement Plan/ Repair Plan), Staples (Technical Support and Protection Plan/ Product Replacement Plan), Ritz Camera Centers (Extended Service Plan), Target (Extended Service Plan), and Brand Source (Expert Protection).

There are a total of 3,440 electoral divisions in Ireland. They are used to define local electoral areas for elections to county and city councils and to define constituencies in elections to D√°il √âireann. Until 1994, they were known as district electoral divisions (DED) in the county council areas and wards in the five county boroughs which were then in existence. Electoral divisions are local administrative units within the NUTS system of the European Union. Origins District electoral divisions originated as subdivisions of poor law unions, grouping a number of townlands together to elect one or more members to a Poor Law Board of Guardians. The boundaries of district electoral divisions were drawn by a Poor Law Boundary Commission, with the intention of producing areas of roughly equivalent \\"rateable value\\" (the total amount of rates that would be paid by all ratepayers in the DED) as well as population. This meant that while DEDs were almost always contiguous, they might bear little relation to natural community boundaries. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 established a system of county councils and urban and rural district councils and the district electoral divisions were then used to elect members to the district councils, with groups of DEDs combining to elect members to county councils. Map of current Electoral Divisions in the Republic of Ireland The introduction of the single transferable vote at the 1920 local elections meant that district electoral divisions were grouped together to elect a number of members to the relevant councils. Rural district councils were abolished in all but Dublin by the Local Government Act 1925, and were abolished in Dublin by the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930. This meant that district electoral divisions no longer had any electoral purpose in their own right. However, they continued to be used for other administrative purposes such as low-level census divisions, and definitions of local electoral areas and constituencies, although in some cases these will cut across EDs. Outside Dublin, most DED boundaries have remained unchanged since the 1850s. In County Dublin, however, the rapid increase in population of the city's suburbs has meant that district electoral divisions have been periodically redrawn so as to produce smaller divisions of a convenient size. In addition, the expansion of the city boundaries of Cork, Limerick and Waterford and the establishment of Galway as a county borough in 1985, required the redrawing of ward boundaries within the cities, and the consequent adjustment of the DEDs affected by the boundary changes. Because the boundaries of district electoral divisions have largely remained unchanged since the nineteenth century, their populations vary widely, ranging from 32,305 for the electoral division of Blanchardstown‚ÄìBlakestown in Fingal to 16 for the electoral divisions of Arigna in County Leitrim (figures from the 2006 Census of Population). To maintain confidentiality, 32 EDs with low population are amalgamated into neighbouring EDs in the presentation of census data. District electoral division boundaries also tend to bear little relation to the boundaries of natural communities in rural Ireland such as parishes, with the result that most people will have little or no idea which electoral division they live in. Northern Ireland After the partition of Ireland and the establishment of Northern Ireland in 1921, the new Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)‚Äìgovernment redrew district electoral division boundaries in the six counties of the region. The government and its supporters claimed that this redrawing was necessary because population changes had caused discrepancies in the population of DEDs and it was necessary to change the boundaries to equalise electorates. Irish nationalists, on the other hand, claimed that the boundaries were being redrawn to gerrymander local councils, producing unionist-majority councils in areas where the majority of the population was nationalist. Certainly, the effect of the redrawing of boundaries was to dramatically reduce the number of local councils under nationalist control, and examination of the archives of the Northern Ireland Government has shownThe Factory of Grievances: Devolved Government in Northern Ireland, 1921‚Äì1939, Patrick Buckland, 1979, Gill & Macmillan, cited in Whyte, op. cit. that the Ministry of Home Affairs (responsible for the boundary redrawing) worked closely with local Unionist associations to produce favourable results for the UUP. With the reform of local government in Northern Ireland in 1973, both county councils and urban and rural district councils were abolished and replaced by a smaller set of district councils. These councils were divided into wards, each ward containing a number of townlands or parts of townlands. As a result, district electoral divisions no longer exist in Northern Ireland and the groups of wards used for single transferable vote are known as \\"district electoral areas\\".

A Swiss Jew, he arrived in England at the age of 12, becoming involved in the Independent Labour Party as a young man. In 1934‚Äì35, he worked with George Orwell in a Hampstead bookshop, Booklover‚Äôs Corner, and later managed the ILP's bookshop at 35 Bride Street, near Ludgate Circus. As chair of the ILP Guild of Youth, he visited Barcelona in 1937, where he again met Orwell. In the early war years, he contributed articles on military strategy to the Evening Standard and, on the recommendation of Michael Foot, was hired by Aneurin Bevan in 1942 as the de facto editor of the left-wing weekly Tribune. (Bevan was nominally the editor but had neither the time nor the technical expertise to do the job, and Kimche was both an alien and a member of the ILP rather than the Labour Party, which Tribune supported.) He left Tribune to join Reuters in 1945 but returned in 1946, though by now his primary interest was in the Middle East‚Äîspecifically, in the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. He was fired from his Tribune job after disappearing from the office in December 1947 to Istanbul to negotiate safe passage with the Turkish authorities for two ships sailing from Bulgaria with thousands of Jews aboard bound for Palestine. From this point on, Kimche made a name for himself as an analyst of Middle Eastern politics, writing several books and innumerable articles. He was for 15 years editor of the Jewish Observer and Middle East Review and was Middle East correspondent of the Evening Standard until 1973. He was one of the original senior members of the Next Century Foundation. Kimche wrote The Secret Roads: The \\"Illegal\\" Migration of People, 1938-1948 published by Secker and Warburg in 1954. The book details the passages of Jewish refugees throughout Europe en route to Palestine. The Haganah, and in some cases Jewish youth groups, such as the Bricha, accomplished this. Kimche documents this group's activities in arranging for Jewish orphans to arrive from all over Europe to Marseilles in 1947 and board the Exodus, which was bound for Palestine.

Based on the stage play, it is a remake of the 1967 French film of the same name, but the setting has been moved to Depression-era New York City and the plot centers on a mob boss trying to go straight. The film stars Sylvester Stallone, Marisa Tomei, Ornella Muti, Tim Curry and Chazz Palminteri, and was a rare attempt by Stallone at doing a comedy role. Plot In the prologue, gangster Angelo \\"Snaps\\" Provolone promises his dying father that he will give up a life of crime, and instead \\"go straight\\". A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bank‚Äôs board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that he‚Äôs in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \\"Snaps' daughter.\\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa. The only child of Snaps and Sofia, Lisa is a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the world‚Äôs great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents at the suggestion of the maid, Nora and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \\"Snaps's daughter\\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military. Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps's dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature. Meanwhile, local police lieutenant Toomey is keeping an eye on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with Chicago mobsters soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who also believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on Snaps in the early afternoon while Toomey plans a raid at the same time to catch Snaps red-handed. While Anthony seeks out Theresa, Snaps meets his mansion's new maid, Roxie. As it turns out, Roxie is an old flame of Snaps, and the pair talk memories and the life that never was. Theresa comes to the mansion and is revealed to be Roxie's daughter‚Äîwho was actually fathered by Snaps long ago‚Äîmaking Snaps her dad after all. The impromptu celebration of both his daughters' engagements is cut short by the arrival of the bankers. During the meeting, Snaps senses the bankers are giving him a raw deal‚Äîthey don't intend to give him any actual influence in the bank's operations, despite the money he's willing to invest. The meeting is interrupted by police officers and Toomey, who is embarrassed to find no money or gangsters present on site. He leaves the mansion just in time for Vendetti's car full of armed men to crash right outside. Toomey smiles for reporters and arrests the men. With the realization that he'd rather deal with gangsters and gunmen than \\"respectable\\" bankers, Snaps decides to abandon his short-lived honest ways and return to a life of crime (looking skyward and admitting to his father, \\"Sorry, pop... I did the best I could\\"). The final scene of the movie shows a double wedding for both his daughters. Oscar himself finally appears and objects to Lisa's marriage, but he is carried off by Snaps' men and the weddings end happily.

(ASCAP) : Landis' first choice for the lead role was Al Pacino, who was going to be paid $2 million for the role but was then offered $3 million to appear in Dick Tracy. \\"He was very upfront about it, he said he was going to go for the money,\\" said Landis. \\"I think Oscar would‚Äôve been a much better movie with Al, but there you go.\\" Stallone later said he should have played \\"Snaps,\\" his character in the film, \\"incredibly cynical like in the original French version\\". Music The film score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and is based around Gioachino Rossini's Barber of Seville. In the Var√®se Sarabande edition of the film soundtrack, Landis penned liner notes about the development of the score: : The opening track is \\"Largo Al Factotum\\" from The Barber of Seville, performed by Earle Patriarco. The track \\"Cops and Real Crooks\\" includes \\"Finucci Piano Boogie,\\" composed and performed by Ralph Grierson. The soundtrack also contained four pre-existing songs which appeared in the film: \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" (performed by Bing Crosby); \\"Rockin' in Rhythm\\" (performed by Duke Ellington & His Orchestra); \\"Tea for Two\\" (performed by Fred Waring & His Pennsylvanians); and \\"Plain Dirt\\" (performed by McKinney's Cotton Pickers). # \\"Largo Al Factotum\\" (performed by Earle Patriarco) (4:42) # \\"Grifting\\" (5:43) # \\"Lisa Dreams\\" (3:46) # \\"Tea and Romance\\" (4:29) # \\"Revelations\\" (5:27) # \\"Cops and Real Crooks\\" (composed and performed by Ralph Grierson) (5:45) # \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" - Bing Crosby (2:54) # \\"Rockin' in Rhythm\\" - Duke Ellington and His Orchestra (3:21) # \\"Tea for Two\\" - Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians (3:21) # \\"Plain Dirt\\" - McKinney's Cotton Pickers (2:38) Release =Theatrical= The film was released theatrically in the United States on April 26, 1991 and had nine international releases from June until September. =Home media= Oscar was released on VHS on September 11, 1991, followed by a Laserdisc edition on November 11. The film was released on DVD on May 6, 2003 and later received a Blu-ray release by Kino Lorber on September 5, 2018. Reception =Critical response= Oscar received mostly negative reviews from critics. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars. While he described the first reel as \\"disastrous\\", he added that the film included \\"truly funny work by enormously talented supporting players.\\" Tribune reviewer Dave Kehr wrote, \\"Landis does his best to give the material a cartoonlike rhythm and stylized sense of movement ... but the labored, repetitive screenplay, by Michael Barrie and Jim Mulholland, defeats him.\\" He continued, \\"For a film meant to define a lighter and fresher image for Stallone, Oscar doesn't quite get the job done.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"D+\\", stating \\"Director John Landis executes the mechanics of farce without a trace of the speed or effervescence this material demands. Every chuckle feels engineered.\\"Gleiberman, Owen (May 3, 1991). \\"Oscar (1991)\\". Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved 2013-01-03. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Variety stated the film was an \\"intermittently amusing throwback to gangster comedies of the 1930s.

The free layer is magnetically soft and the fixed layer is magnetically hard. When the magnetic layers are antiparallel the electrical resistance is higher than when they are aligned. A spin valve is a device, consisting of two or more conducting magnetic materials, whose electrical resistance can change between two values depending on the relative alignment of the magnetization in the layers. The resistance change is a result of the giant magnetoresistive effect. The magnetic layers of the device align \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" depending on an external magnetic field. In the simplest case, a spin valve consists of a non-magnetic material sandwiched between two ferromagnets, one of which is fixed (pinned) by an antiferromagnet which acts to raise its magnetic coercivity and behaves as a \\"hard\\" layer, while the other is free (unpinned) and behaves as a \\"soft\\" layer. Due to the difference in coercivity, the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one. Upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength, the soft layer switches polarity, producing two distinct states: a parallel, low-resistance state, and an antiparallel, high- resistance state.  How it works  Spin valves work because of a quantum property of electrons (and other particles) called spin. Due to a split in the density of states of electrons at the Fermi energy in ferromagnets, there is a net spin polarisation. An electric current passing through a ferromagnet therefore carries both charge and a spin component. In comparison, a normal metal has an equal number of electrons with up and down spins so, in equilibrium situations, such materials can sustain a charge current with a zero net spin component. However, by passing a current from a ferromagnet into a normal metal it is possible for spin to be transferred. A normal metal can thus transfer spin between separate ferromagnets, subject to a long enough spin diffusion length. Spin transmission depends on the alignment of magnetic moments in the ferromagnets. If a current is passing into a ferromagnet whose majority spin is spin up, for example, then electrons with spin up will pass through relatively unhindered, while electrons with spin down will either 'reflect' or spin flip scatter to spin up upon encountering the ferromagnet to find an empty energy state in the new material. Thus if both the fixed and free layers are polarised in the same direction, the device has relatively low electrical resistance, whereas if the applied magnetic field is reversed and the free layer's polarity also reverses, then the device has a higher resistance due to the extra energy required for spin flip scattering. = Antiferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers = An antiferromagnetic layer is required to pin one of the ferromagnetic layers (i.e., make it fixed or magnetically hard). This results from a large negative exchange coupling energy between ferromagnets and antiferromagnets in contact. The non-magnetic layer is required to decouple the two ferromagnetic layers so that at least one of them remains free (magnetically soft). = Pseudo spin valves = The basic operating principles of a pseudo spin valve are identical to that of an ordinary spin valve, but instead of changing the magnetic coercivity of the different ferromagnetic layers by pinning one with an antiferromagnetic layer, the two layers are made of different ferromagnets with different coercivities e.g., NiFe and Co. Note that coercivities are largely an extrinsic property of materials and thus determined by processing conditions.  Applications  Spin valves are used in magnetic sensors and hard disk read heads. They are also used in magnetic random access memories (MRAM).

Titania ()Titania, Lexico/OED. Only the first pronunciation is used in productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream, e.g. Shakespeare Recording Society (1995) The Tempest (audio CD). is a character in William Shakespeare's 1595‚Äì1596 play A Midsummer Night's Dream. In the play, she is the queen of the fairies. Due to Shakespeare's influence, later fiction has often used the name \\"Titania\\" for fairy queen characters.  Overview  In traditional folklore, the fairy queen has no name. Shakespeare took the name \\"Titania\\" from Ovid's Metamorphoses, where it is an appellation given to the daughters of Titans. Shakespeare's Titania is a very proud creature and as much of a force to contend with as her husband, Oberon. She and Oberon are engaged in a marital quarrel over which of them should have the keeping of an Indian changeling boy. This quarrel is the engine that drives the mix-ups and confusion of the other characters in the play. Due to an enchantment cast by Oberon's servant Puck, Titania magically falls in love with a \\"rude mechanical\\" (a labourer), Nick Bottom the weaver, who has been given the head of a donkey by Puck, who feels it is better suited to his character. It has been argued that this incident is an inversion of the Circe story.Paul A. Olson, Beyond a Common Joy: An Introduction to Shakespearean Comedy, University of Nebraska 2008, pp. 79‚Äì82 In this case, the tables are turned on the character and rather than the sorceress turning her lovers into animals, she is made to love a donkey after Bottom has been transformed.  Legacy  Titania has appeared in many other paintings, poems, plays and other works. * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe included the figures from Shakespeare's work in Faust I, where she and her husband are celebrating their golden wedding anniversary. * Carl Maria von Weber used the characters of Titania, Oberon and Puck in his opera Oberon, but this time set during the reign of Charlemagne. *Titania appears in the Shin Megami Tensei series of video games as a recruitable Demon alongside her spouse Oberon. * Alfred Lord Tennyson's play The Foresters, which is a Robin Hood story, has a brief segment with Titania, Queen of the Fairies. * Titania, one of Uranus's moons, was named after her. All of its moons (including Oberon) are named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. * Titania appears in the popular online game Warframe as the namesake of one of the titular Warframes, featuring razor-butterflies and assorted fairy-themed abilities. * In the manga and anime The Ancient Magus' Bride (È≠îÊ≥ï‰Ωø„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂ´Å Mah≈ç Tsukai no Yome) the Queen of the Fairies is named Titania. Her husband Oberon also appears. * In the manga and anime Fairy Tail, Erza Scarlet carries the title of \\"Titania, Queen of the Fairies\\" because of her status as the most powerful of the female wizards in the Fairy Tail guild. * In the cartoon Gargoyles, Oberon and Titania have been divorced for 1,001 years, but remarry during the course of the series. She is also revealed to be the true identity of Anastasia Renard, mother of the recurring antagonist Fox. Titania/Anastasia is voiced by Kate Mulgrew. * Titania is the one of the bases for one of the bosses in Mega Man Zero 4, Sol Titanion, alongside an Atlas moth. * Titania is the queen of the Summer Court of fairies in Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files series. * In W.E.B. Du Bois's Dark Princess, the author dedicates the book to, \\"To her High Loveliness, Titania XXVII...Queen of Faerie.\\" * In Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers, Titania appears as an opponent during the course of the story. In the fiction, the name \\"Titania\\" is actually a title held by the ruler of the faeries rather than a name in itself. * In the light novel series and anime Sword Art Online, main female protagonist Asuna Yuuki is trapped in the virtual fairy world of ALfhiem Online by Nobuyuki Suguo, calling himself Oberon and calling Asuna by the name of Titania. * In Vertigo Comics' The Sandman, Titania rules Faerie with her mate Auberon and is a rumored one-time lover of the titular Lord of Dreams. One issue actually presents that Will Shakespeare created A Midsummer Night's Dream as a commission piece for Dream‚Äîwho presents it to Titania as a gift to Faerie, so that the fey folk should not be forgotten in the Waking World.

Early life and education Tudor was born in Newton Abbot, Devon,England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837‚Äì19151871 England Census in 1871, the only surviving son of Rev. Harry Tudor, Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral, and his wife, Charlotte Aurora Ensor. Tudor enrolled in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1888. Early career: India and South Africa Tudor was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Horse Artillery on 25 July 1890. He was stationed in India from 1890 until 1897, when he returned to England, having been promoted to lieutenant on 25 July 1893.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1901 Tudor was sent to South Africa during the Second Boer War where he was badly wounded at the Battle of Magersfontein (11 December 1899), but recovered and returned to duty, and was promoted to captain on 7 February 1900. He served as divisional adjutant and was mentioned in despatches (including the final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902). His extensive service in South Africa was reflected by his campaign medals: the Queen's South Africa Medal with four clasps, and the King's South Africa Medal with two. After the South African war ended, Tudor went back to India for another five years (1905‚Äì10), and then was posted to Egypt, where he stayed until the start of the First World War. First World War Tudor served on the Western Front from December 1914 to the Armistice, rising from the rank of captain in charge of an artillery battery to the rank of major general and the command of the 9th (Scottish) Division. He continued to command this formation after 11 November 1918, as part of the Army of the Rhine, until the 9th Division was disbanded in March 1919. Tudor was a professional and forward-looking artilleryman: historian Paddy Griffith has described him as an \\"expert tactician.\\" He was a fighting general who spent a lot of time in the front lines: he was almost killed at the Third Battle of Ypres in October 1917, when a shell fragment hit him in the head and smashed his helmet. He was the first British general to use smoke shells to create screens, and one of the first advocates of predicted artillery fire. He suggested an attack in the Cambrai sector in July 1917, and his artillery ideas helped lay the foundation for the British breakthrough in the battle there in November. In addition, he was almost captured by the Germans during Operation Michael, the first German offensive in the spring of 1918. Ireland After the 9th Division was disbanded, Tudor was posted once again to Egypt and India. In May 1920, however, he was appointed 'Police Adviser' to the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland and promoted to Lieutenant- General. His chief qualification for this post was his friendship with the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill. Tudor had met Churchill in Bangalore in 1895, and the two men became lifelong friends. During the brief period when Churchill had served as an infantry officer on the Western Front in early 1916, he was posted to the same sector as Tudor, near Ploegsteert Wood.Joy Cave, \\"A Gallant Gunner General,\\" esp. pp. 92, 97, and 102. =Situation= When Tudor took up his new post, the Irish War of Independence was approaching a crisis: indeed, within a couple of months, the British administration in Ireland was on the verge of collapse. The Royal Irish Constabulary's morale and effective strength were both declining: Irish Republican Army guerrillas were ambushing police patrols, burning police barracks, and organising boycotts of police and their families. Railway workers went on strike, refusing to move trains that carried armed police or troops. Merchants refused to serve police customers. Police recruits and servants were being attacked and intimidated, and women who were friendly with police had their hair cut off. Police property was wrecked and stolen: in some cases, police bicycles were taken away while their owners were in church. Hundreds of police officers resigned both as a result of intimidation and in protest at the governments repeated mass releases of IRA prisoners which continued up until the spring of 1920. Meanwhile, Sinn F√©in was building an alternative state‚Äîthe Irish Republic proclaimed during the Easter Rising of 1916. Local governments were acknowledging the authority of the First D√°il. IRA Volunteers were acting as Republican police. Republican courts were adjudicating both civil and criminal cases. In some parts of Ireland, the Republic was becoming a reality. Tudor's assignment, as he saw it, was to raise police morale, to punish crime, and to restore law and order: \\"I had nothing to do with politics,\\" he wrote years later, \\"and don't care a hoop of hell what measure of Home Rule they got.\\" At a Cabinet conference on 23 July 1920, while his Dublin Castle colleagues were calling for an offer of dominion status (i.e. Canadian-style self-government, within the Empire), Tudor was confident that, \\"given the proper support, it would be possible to crush the present campaign of outrage.\\" \\"The whole country was intimidated,\\" he said, \\"and would thank God for strong measures.\\"David Leeson, \\"The Black and Tans: British Police in the First Irish War, 1920‚Äì21,\\" p. 47 The Government chose the hard line: on 9 August 1920, Parliament passed the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, which gave Dublin Castle the power to govern by regulation; to replace the criminal courts with courts martial; to replace coroner's inquests with military courts of inquiry; and to punish disaffected local governments by withholding grants of money. =Tudor's leadership= As Police Adviser, Tudor assumed control of Ireland's police forces, and eventually styled himself \\"Chief of Police\\". Under his administration, the police were militarised: indeed, at the Cabinet conference of 23 July 1920, Tudor had conceded that the RIC would soon become ineffective as a police force; \\"but as a military body he thought they might have great effect.\\" Like his patron, Churchill, Tudor gave police posts to his military friends and colleagues: Brigadier-General Ormonde Winter, for example, became Deputy Police Adviser and Head of Intelligence; \\"He had once been my Captain in a battery at Rawalpindi,\\" said Tudor, \\"and we had done a lot of racing together at various meetings in India.\\" The beleaguered RIC was reinforced with British ex- soldiers and sailors‚Äîthe notorious 'Black and Tans'.'This is the story of the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, the most notorious police forces in the history of the British Isles.'

W. H Kautt goes even further, and says the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries are 'infamous,' but argues that only the Auxiliaries 'actually earned this infamy.' W. H. Kautt, Ambushes and Armour: The Irish Rebellion, 1919‚Äì1921 (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2011) p. 80. With the army stretched very thin by the deployment of 2 extra divisions to Iraq, and the threatened British coal strike in September 1920, Tudor created the Auxiliary Division, a temporary gendarmerie composed of ex-officers and commanded by a pair of experienced colonial warriors: Brigadier-General Frank Percy Crozier and Brigadier-General E. A. Wood; its numbers peaked at 1,500 in July 1921.Leeson, \\"Black and Tans,\\" pp. 47‚Äì48.Jeffery 2006 p264-5 =Reprisals and indiscipline= But while working hard to rebuild the RIC's numbers and morale, Tudor did comparatively little to restore its discipline. When police and auxiliaries were killed in ambushes and attacks, their comrades often responded with reprisals against Irish Republicans and their communities: some of these reprisals were spontaneous \\"police riots,\\" but others were organised and led by local police officials. Tudor's own response to these outbreaks of arson and murder was weak and ambiguous: in a memorandum on discipline dated 12 November 1920, Tudor admonished his men to maintain \\"the highest discipline\\", while reassuring them that they would have \\"the fullest support in the most drastic action against that band of assassins, the so-called IRA.\\" Macready (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) had been initially impressed by Tudor (June 1920) and thought he was getting rid of \\"incompetent idiots\\" from senior police positions. Macready and the CIGS Henry Wilson became increasingly concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, who loved to drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal for the deaths of pro-Crown forces. However Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging \\"accidents\\" for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did not want them \\"talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers\\".Jeffery 2006 p265-6 Tudor's complicity in the reprisals was implied by Macready when he wrote that \\"assassination is rife and the G.S. [General Staff] have now adopted it √† la Tudor and Co.\\" p120 Improving the law Enforcement-Intelligence Community Relationship quoting General Sir Nevil Macready, GOCinC, British Forces Ireland, personal letter to Lt.-Gen. Sir Hugh Jeudwine, Commander of 5th Division, April 1922, Imperial War Museum (IWM), papers of Lt.-Gen. Sir Hugh Jeudwine, 72/82/2 Bloody Sunday (Irish: Domhnach na Fola) was a day of violence in Dublin on 21 November 1920, during the Irish War of Independence. More than 30 people were killed or fatally wounded. The day began with an Irish Republican Army operation, organised by Michael Collins, to assassinate members of the \\"Cairo Gang\\" ‚Äì a team of undercover British intelligence agents working and living in Dublin. IRA members went to a number of addresses and killed or fatally wounded 16 men, mostly British Army intelligence officers. Five other men were wounded. Later that afternoon, in retaliation, members of the Auxiliary Division and RIC opened fire on the crowd at a Gaelic football match in Croke Park, killing or fatally wounding fourteen civilians and wounding at least sixty others. After a Roman Catholic priest was shot dead by an insane Auxiliary in December 1920, a Castle official noted in his diary that he felt some sympathy for the killer, \\"as these men have undoubtedly been influenced by what they have taken as the passive approval of their officers from Tudor downwards to believe that they will never be punished for anything.\\"Leeson, \\"Black and Tans,\\" p. 226 After the killing of 17 Auxiliaries in an ambush at Macroom, County Cork, martial law was declared (10 December 1920) in the four Munster Counties of Cork, Tipperary, Kerry and Limerick. On 23 December Irish Home Rule became law, to the delight of the Opposition Asquith Liberal faction and Labour Party. On 29 December, Tudor attended a special Cabinet conference, along with Wilson, Macready and John Anderson (Head of the Civil Service in Dublin), who all advised that no truce should be allowed for elections to the planned Dublin Parliament, and that at least four months of martial law would be required to restore order: the date for the elections was therefore set for May 1921. Martial law was then extended over the rest of Munster (Counties Waterford and Clare) and part of Leinster (Counties Kilkenny and Wexford).Jeffery 2006 p267-9 By this time, however, reprisals had become a scandal in Britain. In the first half of 1921, police discipline improved, and police reprisals became less common, but this improvement came too late: the political damage was irreversible. In addition, Macready had lost confidence in Tudor (who was also being criticised by Robertson, under whom he had previously served on the Rhine) and thought the RIC had become unreliable. The Irish War of Independence reached a climax in the first half of 1921, with deaths of Crown forces running at approximately double the rate of those in the second half of 1920.Jeffery 2006 p270-1 However IRA losses were also mounting with many of their key members captured and the organisation critically short of funds and ammunition: IRA leader Michael Collins would later describe them to Chief Secretary of Ireland Hamar Greenwood as 'dead beat' and 'within six weeks of defeat' by the summer of 1921. By May 1921, it was clear however that the Government's strategy of combining limited repression with limited concessions was not working. With the Irish elections and the potential Triple Alliance strike in Britain out of the way, an extra 17 army battalions were sent (bringing British strength up to 60,000) in June and July 1921; but the politicians drew back from the brink, and faced with the choice of either waging a war of reconquest or negotiating peace with the insurgents, they opened secret talks with James Craig and √âamon de Valera.Jeffery 2006 p271-3 A Truce was agreed in July 1921, and a Treaty signed in December.Leeson, \\"Black and Tans,\\" pp. 78‚Äì79 Whilst the Anglo-Irish Treaty would prove acceptable to the British government and Irish Unionists its terms prompted a vicious conflict between Irish Republicans resulting in the Irish Civil War. Palestine Tudor remained Chief of Police until his forces had been demobilised and the RIC was disbanded. In February 1922, Churchill (who was now Secretary of State for the Colonies) appointed his friend to a new post in the troubled Palestine Mandate - General Officer Commanding and Inspector- General of Police and Prisons, with the temporary rank of air vice marshal. Tudor was in the process of raising a British Gendarmerie for the territory at the time which was overwhelmingly recruited from amongst former Black and Tans and Auxiliaries. He arrived in Palestine to assume the role in June but his refusal to properly manage his dual civil and military responsibilities resulted in his effective dismissal.https://www.theirishstory.com/2020/04/16/henry-hugh-tudor-his-life- and-times/#.XqH3H2hKhPY He left Palestine in March 1924 and handed over to Air Commodore Eugene Gerrard;Air of Authority ‚Äì A History of RAF Organisation he relinquished his temporary commission as an air vice marshal on 26 April 1924. Later life In 1923, Tudor was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In 1924, he retired both from his position as Palestine's Director of Public Safety, and from the Army. He then emigrated to Newfoundland, where he remained for the rest of his life. In the 1950s, Tudor's presence in Newfoundland became known to the Irish Republican Army and two of its members were sent to St. John's to assassinate him. Their planned assassination was not carried out after consultations with a local Catholic priest, Rev. Joseph McDermott, who informed them that their escape plan was bound to fail.Tim Pat Coogan, \\"Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora\\" pp.432 Media In 2012, Newfoundland based independent audio program producers, Battery Radio, produced a story on Tudor, entitled 'A Bullet For The General'.

Samford Valley. Mountains in the range include Camp Mountain, Mount Nebo, Mount Pleasant, Mount Glorious, Mount Samson and Mount Mee. Directly to the south in the west of Brisbane is the Taylor Range, sometimes considered an eastern spur of the D'Aguilar Range. Further north, highly visible from the D'Aguilar Ranges, are the Glass House Mountains. Mount D'Aguilar at 750 m above sea level is the second highest peak in the range. The highest point is Tenison Woods Mountain at 770 m. This peak is not distinct and is not marked on old maps. The Congregation of the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration created a plaque on the summit to commemorate the naming of the mountain in 1974. The year also marked the centenary of their order which was founded by J.E. Tenison Woods. Mermaid Mountain is the highest point in the southern sections at 396 m in elevation. Well known lookouts on the range include McAfee's Lookout and Jolly's Lookout, both of which have views east across to Moreton Bay.

As a Territorial delegate, he saw Arizona achieve statehood in 1912. Cameron's greatest achievement in the US Senate was authorization for the Coolidge Dam. On the business front, Cameron was active early in efforts to develop the Grand Canyon. Toward this end he often used his political influence to help his business interests. Popular among residents of northern Arizona for much of his political career, his fortunes changed after he reached the U.S. Senate and voters began to view his actions as self-serving. Background Cameron was born on October 21, 1863 to Henry and Abigail Ann (Jones) Cameron in Southport, Maine. He attended public schools until the age of thirteen when he left home for the fishing fleet working the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Cameron would later claim that much of his knowledge came from the \\"School of Hard Knocks\\". After five years employment as a fisherman, Cameron moved to Boston where he became a store clerk. After reading John Wesley Powell's account of his 1869 exploration of the Colorado River, Cameron wanted to learn more about the American Southwest. This prompted him to quit his job and take a train to Flagstaff, Arizona Territory in 1883. He initially worked at a sawmill but shortly thereafter joined his brother, Niles, in operating a mercantile store. Two months after his arrival, Cameron visited the Grand Canyon. He explored the area for nine days on his first visit and returned a year later with Edward E. Ayer to investigate lumbering opportunities along the South Rim. The brothers eventually sold their store and focused on mining in the Grand Canyon. In 1890, Cameron assisted Peter Berry and his brother Niles in prospecting around the Grand Canyon. The trio established the Last Chance Mine. To improve access to the mine, Berry constructed a trail and a log cabin hotel in 1892 and 1893. Bright Angel trail Recognizing the Grand Canyon's potential for tourism, Cameron and his brother built a hotel at the head of the Bright Angel Trail and began charging a toll for use of the trail. The trail, which probably began as a game trail, had been improved by Berry, Niel Cameron, and others (the level of Ralph Cameron's involvement is unclear). Berry filed paperwork to establish it as a private toll road in February 1891. The trail saw little traffic and fell into disrepair by 1897. In either 1901 or 1902, Cameron obtained Berry's rights to the trail. Cameron received a five-year extension to the original ten year right to collect tolls, extending his franchise on the trail til 1906. He also began filing strategically placed mining claims, owning 39 such claims by 1907. Among the claims were the Wizard, which was located at the point where the trail reached the Colorado River, the Alder and Willow mill sites which controlled Indian Garden along with a nearby spring, the Magician claim which contained the trail's most demanding section, the Devil's Corkscrew, and Gold Eagle and Cape Horn claims at the top of the South Rim and containing Cameron's hotel along with the trail head. The Grand Canyon Railway was completed in 1901. The railroad had an arrangement with a competing hotel which prevented Cameron from soliciting visitors at the railroad station, a practice that limited customers to his hotel. At the same time, Cameron angered a number of people by charging for use of the Bright Angel Trail. Tensions increased to the point where employees of both hotels began wearing firearms. Cameron closed his hotel after the El Tovar Hotel was opened. Coconino County In 1889, Cameron became a leader in the efforts to create Coconino County from northern Yavapai County after becoming upset about having to travel to Prescott for jury duty and only receiving $2/day for the time and effort. When the new county was formed in 1891, Governor John N. Irwin appointed Cameron as the county's first sheriff. He served in the position for three terms, winning reelection in 1894 and 1896. He was a McKinley delegate during the 1896 Republican National Convention. Cameron married Ida May Spaulding in Flagstaff on November 25, 1895. The couple had two children: Ralph Jr. and Catherine. Ida May Spaulding Cameron with daughter Catherine (c. 1921) When Cameron attempted to obtain patents for several of his mining claims, the Santa Fe Railroad contested the claims and sued to block the patents on the basis the claims did not have any valuable minerals. The Gold Eagle and Cape Horn also partially overlapped the railroad station grounds. As the 1898 Congressional grant authorizing the railroad station predated Cameron's 1902 claim application, the railroad maintained control of its grounds and right of way but in 1906, Judge Richard E. Sloan found sufficient evidence of mineral deposits for Cameron to keep his mining claim after adjusting its boundaries. As the 1906 expiration of his franchise on the Bright Angel trail approached, Cameron began looking for new ways to extend his control of the trail. He was elected to the Coconino County Board of supervisors in 1904. A year later he became the board's chairman. When the 24th Arizona Territorial Legislature convened, he lobbied the session to pass the \\"Cameron bill\\" which required counties to give preference to the prior owner of a toll road when awarding the operating contract after a franchise on a road expired. Interior Secretary Ethan A. Hitchcock sent a telegram protesting the bill, prompting Governor Joseph H. Kibbey to veto the legislation. The legislature overrode the veto and passed the bill on March 18, 1907. When Cameron's franchise expired, the Santa Fe railroad offered to pay 70% of all collected tolls to the county in exchange for the contract to operate the Bright Angel trail. The county board rejected the railroad's offer and awarded a five-year contract to Cameron in 1907. The Santa Fe railroad appealed the decision on Cameron's mining claims to Land Office Commissioner Richard A. Ballinger. Following a common pattern where local land office officials who had ruled in Cameron's favor were overruled by their Washington superiors, Ballinger rejected Cameron's patent applications. Cameron then appealed to Interior Secretary James R. Garfield. Garfield initially found some pertinent information had not been included in the initial investigation and in August 1907 ordered a new investigation into Cameron's claims. Garfield issued a decision in February 1909 which found the disputed claims did not \\"possess such mineral character and values as to justify the land department in awarding the desired patent\\". Territorial Delegate During the election of 1908, there was a widespread feeling throughout the territory that a Republican could have better results achieving statehood in a Republican controlled Congress than had been achieved by Arizona Territory's Democratic delegate, Mark Smith. Smith had accumulated a number of political enemies during his many years in office and spent time campaigning for William Jennings Bryan instead of working for his own re- election. Cameron received his party's nomination for the position on August 22. During the general election, he defeated Smith by a vote of 12,435 to 11,727 with all other candidates receiving 2,205 votes combined. Territorial Delegate Ralph Cameron Cameron took office on March 4, 1909. He was assigned to the House committees on Territories, Post Office and Post Roads, Mines and Mining, and Indian Affairs. Cameron submitted several bills during his first session, including a statehood bill, but did not speak from the House floor until the second session. When his statehood bill came up for debate before the House, Arizona's delegate argued, \\"It is a matter of history that Arizona has been knocking at the doors of Congress for many, may years, and its just claims to recognition and inclusion in the Sisterhood of States have met with scant consideration, notwithstanding the numerous promises and pledges of the two dominant parties.\\" Cameron went on to point out that Arizona contained 37,000 qualified voters who were being denied the opportunity to have a say in the election of Presidents and other national leaders. The House passed the Arizona statehood bill on January 17 with President Taft signing the enabling act on June 20, 1910. Instead of facing reelection in 1910, Cameron's term was extended by presidential proclamation as part of process granting Arizona statehood. As early as 1898 there was talk of the Grand Canyon becoming a national park. Most residents of northern Arizona Territory believed that mining was vital to the economic development of the area and opposed any efforts to give the canyon park status. Cameron felt that Washington tended to favor big business over the interests of local government and individuals. Despite the local opposition, President Roosevelt established Grand Canyon National Monument on January 22, 1908. In 1908 Cameron proposed creation of the Grand Canyon Scenic Railroad Company to build a scenic rail line along the south rim of the canyon and submitted a bill to gain Congressional approval for a right of way the next year. The Agriculture and Interior departments opposed the territorial delegate's plan but granted a permit to a Santa Fe railroad subsidiary authorizing construction of a road to the Grand Canyon the next year. The permit included a clause authorizing the subsidiary to \\"maintain as a free public highway the trail known as the Bright Angel Trail.\\" Agriculture Secretary James Wilson blocked the Forest Service from action related to the Bright Angel, citing a 1909 decision by the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court which found the trail had been established prior to Grand Canyon National Forest and its rights had been \\"fixed permanently\\". Wilson did authorize construction of the road and it was completed in 1914. Signing of Arizona Statehood Bill. Territorial Delegate Cameron standing to left of President Taft As early as 1907, potential investors looked to partner with Cameron to develop the Grand Canyon. Warner, Tucker & Company of Boston purchased options for Cameron's mining claims when it looked into building a hydroelectric dam in the canyon. Other investors with plans for other dams, funiculars, mining projects, and a pipeline to pump water from Indian Gardens to the South Rim followed but nothing ever came of these proposals as Cameron was unable to establish clear title on his claims. The adverse decision by the Interior Department did not halt Cameron in his efforts to find investors as he continued to claim his mining claims were valid. Arizona's constitutional convention met from October 10 till December 9, 1910 and was composed of 11 Republicans and 41 Democrats. The resulting document contained a number of Progressive Era reforms including provisions for recall, referendum, and initiative. Cameron was not a supporter of the proposed constitution. He joined with Governor Richard E. Sloan in claiming the proposed constitution would cause a postponement of Arizona statehood. Final Congressional approval for Arizona statehood occurred on August 10, 1911. President Taft vetoed the statehood bill, citing his opposition to the recall of judges. The same day as the veto, a bill was introduced in Congress to admit Arizona provided the proposed constitution had the provision allowing recall of judges removed. The new bill was signed by President Taft on August 21, 1911. Arizona voters approved the required change and Arizona became a state on February 14, 1912. Out of office During the 1911 run up to statehood, Cameron was a Republican nominee for United States Senate but lost in general election. After leaving office he turned his focus to his business career and became president of the Arizona Securities and Investment Company. An exception to this came in 1914 when Cameron was the Republican nominee to replace George W. P. Hunt as Governor of Arizona. After being defeated in this race, Cameron decided to sit back and wait for a good opportunity before making another run for office. 1914 campaign handbill In addition to his political efforts, Cameron was busy with development plans for the Grand Canyon. On May 24, 1912 a plan involving a Philadelphia investment group was announced. If completed the deal would have paid Cameron over $5 million (equivalent to $ in ). The next month, the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company paid $40,000 for right of ways across Cameron's Cape Horn claim at the top of the South Rim along with other claims along the Bright Angel and Hermit trails. Included in the deal were water rights to the springs at Indian Gardens. Most details of the deal were kept secret to protect the railroad from potential opportunists. While Cameron was working on his business deals, the Forest Service was having difficulties administering the Grand Canyon National Monument. Part of the Forest Services problems was Cameron and other northern Arizona residents were able to block development plans for the canyon through their mining claims. Dealing with the claims was complicated by the fact the national monument was administered by the Department of Agriculture while the mining claims were administered by the Interior Department. Creation of a national park would simplify things by combining administration into just the Interior department. Toward this end, Chief Forester Henry S. Graves began lobbying the U.S. Congress to create a national park at the Grand Canyon in 1914. The Forest Service also considered legal action against the claims but deferred any action over concerns that a suit would enrage local opinion against the service. Control of vendors at the canyon presented another problem, with some business using megaphones to attract tourists. To deal with this, the Forest service adapted a policy of \\"regulated competition\\". This displaced a number of small independent vendors and granted virtual monopolies to the Fred Harvey Company and Santa Fe railroad. In 1914, Cameron filed another application for a patent on his Cape Horn mining claim. The next year the Forest Service filed suit to block the application. In 1916, a suit was filed to invalidate Cameron's mining claims at Indians Gardens. This second suit was placed on hold pending resolution of the first case. The first case made its way the United States Supreme Court which ruled in favor of the government on April 19, 1920. The courts invalidated Cameron's Indian Gardens claims in February 1921. On top of this, President Wilson signed into law a bill creating the Grand Canyon National Park on February 26, 1919. Despite the growing number of obstacles to his claims, Cameron remained optimistic of his chances to control important sections of the Grand Canyon. This confidence was bolstered by the fact that mining claims he had staked in 1902 had not been challenged and improvements in his political outlook as the 1920s dawned. By 1920, many Arizona voters were tiring of Woodrow Wilson's policies and desired the \\"normalcy\\" offered by Republican challenger Warren G. Harding. With Republican opportunities looking favorable for the coming election, Cameron decided to challenge Mark Smith for a seat in the United States Senate. Cameron defeated three other challengers during the September 7 primary to win the Republican nomination. Cameron's primary campaign promise was to win a $12 million appropriation to build a dam on the Gila River near San Carlos, Arizona. A second promise to the American Legion was to reallocate of the Colorado River Indian Reservation and give the land to war veterans for settlement. He also told the voters how a pair of hydroelectric dams in the Grand Canyon could \\"electrify every railroad, mine, mill, city, town and hamlet in Arizona.\\" During the run up to the general election, the 69-year-old Smith seemed to lack the vitality of his younger opponent. Cameron won the election by a vote of 35,893 to 28,169. U.S. Senate Upon taking office, Cameron was assigned to the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Military Affairs, Irrigation and Reclamation, and the District of Columbia. Shortly after taking office, Cameron faced several legal challenges. First, a Boston man filed a $100,000 suit against Cameron claiming alienation of affections on March 27, 1921. Cameron had met the man casually on a train in 1913 and his wife had left him in 1916. Cameron denied the allegations and promised to \\"fight this suit with both fists, fearlessly and in the open.\\" As Arizona law established a four-year statute of limitations on suits of this type the case was quietly dismissed. This was followed by an indictment on the charge of perjury on October 24, 1921. The charges against the senator claimed he had failed to properly report donations he had received during his 1920 Senate race. Cameron's attorney's pointed out during a May 11, 1922 preliminary hearing that while campaign finance laws at the time required reporting of expenditures there was no requirement to report any received donations. The judge overseeing the case agreed with Cameron's attorneys and dismissed the charges on May 17. Senator Ralph Cameron (c. 1921) Upon returning to the Senate, Cameron voted for the Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff. He was unsuccessful in efforts to establish a tariff on cotton imports. He voted for the Bonus Bill but later voted against overturning President Harding's veto. When the Bonus bill came back up in 1924, Cameron voted for the legislation again and supported overturning President Coolidge's veto. Cameron began efforts to have Stephen Mather removed as director of the National Park Service shortly after taking office. Mather was politically well connected and able to retain his position. When it became evident to Cameron that he could not remove Mather, he turned to having appointees favorable to his cause named to the Land Office in Phoenix, the Surveyor General of Arizona, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. After Cameron's brother-in-law, L. L. Ferrall, was named postmaster for the Grand Canyon, park rangers began to complain that their mail was being opened before they received it. To counter the perceived threat, park officials began sending official communications in code and having their mail addressed to their wives or friends. His seat in the Senate allowed Cameron to strike at the Park Service through their funding. In February 1922, he claimed that funding to develop the Grand Canyon National Park would result in camping sites for just \\"thirty or forty millionaires\\" and managed to have the appropriation removed from the bill to fund the Interior Department. Arizona's other congressional representatives, Carl Hayden and Henry F. Ashurst, fought to restore the funding but Cameron was able to block the efforts for several months. Eventually the Senate authorized $75,000 for the Grand Canyon National Park, down from $100,000 in 1921. Cameron additionally used his political position to try and regain control of the Bright Angel Trail, which he still claimed to own. In May 1922 he offered to pay Coconino County $1,875/year for a five-year lease on the trail. This would allow Cameron to continue to charge trail users $1.00 for each horse or mule using the trail. The county declined the senator's offer after the Santa Fe railroad made a higher bid. In March 1923, Hayden and Congressman Louis C. Cramton of Michigan met with representatives of the county, Park Service, and Fred Harvey company to discuss purchasing the trail. The proposal agreed to at the meeting called for a $100,000 appropriation to build a dirt access road from a railroad station to the canyon. After learning of the proposal, Cameron worked against the plan for the Federal government to purchase the trail. Toward this end he argued that with the Federal Government owning 75% or more of the land in Coconino County, and thus rendering the land nontaxable by the county, the $7-8,000 of toll revenue generated by the trail was vital to the county. Congressman Cramton countered the senator's claims and accused Cameron of retaining illegal interests in the trail via his mining claims. A compromise was reached in late March 1924 where a provision requiring county voters approve the sale was approved by Congress. By this time, the Coconino Sun, which had traditionally been a Cameron supporter, accused the senator of using the county as a pawn in his efforts to retain control of the trail and urged voters to approve the sale. County voters rejected the sale 1,247 to 755. Senator Ralph H. Cameron (c. 1924) Cameron's greatest legislative success came in 1924 when he and Carl Hayden obtained a $5,500,000 appropriation for construction of the Coolidge Dam. The year also brought the first of several legal setbacks. In August 1924, a lawsuit attempting to force Cameron to remove employees and building along the Bright Angel Trail resulted a contempt charge being brought against the senator. Cameron's lawyers were unsuccessful in efforts to make the charge go away at a September 15 hearing but did obtain a two-week continuance. The charge was dropped after Cameron ordered his employees to move away from the trail. In 1925, the Federal government filed suit to have mining claims in the Grand Canyon and Boulder canyon owned by the United States Platinum Company, a firm owned by Cameron and several other partners, disqualified on the basis that the claim sites did not have extractable concentrations of platinum. A December 16, 1925 ruling invalidated the claims. Other mining claims were also challenged but the challenges were delayed by Cameron's brother-in-law, L. L. Farrell, who was then registrar of the General Land Office in Phoenix. The Commissioner of the General Land Office, William Spry, overruled Farrell in January 1926 and invalidated Cameron's other mining claims. The senator responded by getting a bill passed that created a congressional committee authorized to investigate the Agriculture and Interior departments. Cameron was appointed the committee's chairman and focused most of the committee's attention on the director of the National Park Service. The legal losses began affecting Cameron's political fortunes, with voters starting to see him as self-serving. To counter this, he introduced a number of legislative initiatives designed to aid his constituents. In January 1925, the senator won a $200,000 appropriation for a new irrigation system near Yuma. This was followed the next month with a $650,000 allocation for upkeep of the system. Cameron attempted to establish a 6¬¢/pound tariff on copper imports, claiming the tax would \\"permit the [American] copper miner to reenergize the dying copper industry of his homeland\\", but unsuccessful in his efforts. His efforts to remove all grazing fees on Federal land resulted in a 50% reduction in fees charged. Cameron was also a leader in Arizona's efforts to prevent construction of Boulder Dam. During the 1926 election, Cameron received the support of Republican leaders but only tepid support from rank and file membership. In contrast, his challenger, Congressman Carl Hayden, in turn had a united party, the backing of labor, and the support of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Cameron campaigned on a message highlighting his successes during his first term. Democrats countered by claiming his successes were joint Republican and Democratic efforts and that his inability to win a cotton tariff showed him to be ineffective. A series of six article written by Hayden supporter Will Irwin was published by the Los Angeles Times in mid 1926. These articles examined Cameron's history with the Grand Canyon and claimed he had salted several claims in the canyon in order to control the valuable sites. Cameron condemned the articles' claims as \\"malicious fabrications\\" but the political damage had already been done. Hayden won the election by a vote of 44,591 to 31,845. The election loss combined with his legal defeats ended Cameron's influence in the Grand Canyon. Later life After leaving office, Cameron ran in 1928 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Henry F. Ashurst. He won the Republican nomination but lost to the incumbent in the general election. He ran again in 1932, trying to regain his old Senate seat but was again defeated by Carl Hayden. Cameron then left Arizona, living for a time in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles. He made a living working mining projects in Arizona, California, Georgia, and North Carolina. In 1933, Cameron divorced his first wife. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Reese, on August 19, 1935. By the early 1950s, Cameron had returned to Arizona. His health was failing at the time and he underwent two major operations. His final project was development of a medical hot springs center near Yuma intended to treat arthritis and polio cases. While on a business trip to Washington D.C., Cameron suffered a heart attack on February 7, 1953. While recovering, he developed bronchial pneumonia and died on February 12, 1953. He was buried in Grand Canyon Village, Arizona. The epitaph on his grave marker says \\"Secured Statehood for Arizona Feb. 14, 1912. Arizona can never forget him.\\" The community of Cameron, Arizona is named after him.

By 1968 the other members wanted to change musical direction to a more psychedelic/American west-coast guitar sound, so Oakley left, to be replaced by Deke Leonard; and the band changed its name to Man.  Pye years  Man were initially signed to Pye Records, for which they recorded their first two albums with John Schroeder producing Revelation (January 1969) noted for the simulated orgasm on \\"Erotica\\", which received a UK ban,BBC Wales Biography Retrieved 10 August 2009. and 2 Ozs of Plastic with a Hole in the Middle (September 1969).

At this time, Man were recording three demo sessions a week for Leeds Music, including \\"Down the Dustpipe\\" which they taught to Status Quo. Man then toured Europe, predominantly Germany, where they supported Chicago, but on their return, were stopped as suspected terrorists, then jailed for drugs offences in Belgium. Leonard then rejoined, but Ace stayed on as a multi- instrumentalist. Shortly after, bassist Ray Williams and drummer Jeff Jones were fired, with Terry Williams joining on drums and Ace moving to bass. Leonard, Ace and Terry Williams having been together in 'Dream', this was seen by some as a take-over. A bootleg of the first gig by this line-up, October 1970 in Hamburg, was issued as To Live for to Die (recorded 1970, CD issued as The Honest One in 1992 & 1997) and was later re-bootlegged by the band.Sleeve notes to To Live for to Die Point 1997 re-release Despite good reviews in Britain Two Ounces of Plastic ... was more popular in Germany, so the band spent a year in Germany, where, having to play 4‚Äì5 hours a night, most numbers became extended jams.

The 21 April gig in Chicago was recorded for radio and issued on CD in 1997 as The 1999 Party Tour, but omits Morley from the credits, although he is on the recording. Morley left the day before recording started on the next album Slow Motion (October 1974). Before the album was released, the band toured the UK (again with Badfinger) and USA in August‚ÄìOctober 1974. They returned to the US in March 1975, to promote the album by touring with REO Speedwagon and New Riders of the Purple Sage, but the tour collapsed on the first night. A new US tour, with REO Speedwagon and Blue √ñyster Cult broke up two-thirds of the way through. Additional dates were arranged, but most were cancelled when Micky Jones developed pneumonia, so the final gigs were to be at the San Francisco Winterland. These were a great success, and promoter Bill Graham paid them a bonus, and rebooked them, but bassist Ken Whaley had had enough, and left. Martin Ace flew out as a stand in, and the band met and rehearsed with John Cipollina of Quicksilver Messenger Service, who played with them at Winterland, and agreed to play a UK tour. On this tour, the Roundhouse gig was recorded for commercial release, and although Buckley and Ellingham state that it is rumoured that Micky Jones had to over-dub Cipollina's guitar, it was only the track \\"Bananas\\" on which his playing was replaced: \\"Everything on Maximum Darkness which sounds like Cipollina is Cipollina\\", per Deke Leonard.Many Are Called, but Few Get Up - a tribute to Micky Jones of the Man band (by Phil McMullen, March 2010) The album Maximum Darkness (September 1975) eventually reaching no 25 in the UK album chart and Martin Ace continued as \\"stand in\\" bassist, until the end of a French tour, with Hawkwind, Gong and Magma, when he returned to the 'Flying Aces'.  MCA  The band changed label to MCA Records, Phil Ryan rejoined on keyboards, but as no bass players they knew were available, the band had to audition for the first time in their history.

During the US tour differences arose again, and on the subsequent European tour keyboardist Phil Ryan and bassist John McKenzie announced they would be leaving, and the rest of the band agreed to call it a day. The MCA record deal, however, was for three albums, but nobody was willing to contribute new material, and their attempts at covers were poor, so MCA eventually agreed to a live farewell album. All's Well That Ends Well (November 1977) was recorded at the Roundhouse on 11‚Äì13 December, although the final gig was in Slough on 16 December 1976.

They continued until 1982, issuing several successful albums & singles and touring the USA and Europe. Williams briefly worked with Meat Loaf, before receiving an offer from Dire Straits, who he was still working with, when Man reformed.  Reformed  The band reformed in 1983, with a line-up of Micky Jones and Deke Leonard on guitars, Martin Ace on bass and John \\"Pugwash\\" Weathers (formerly of Gentle Giant) on drums. This line-up was to stay constant until 1996, except from a short spell, when Weathers was unwell, and Rick Martinez temporarily took over. After rehearsals, their first gig was on All Fools Day at the Marquee Club in London, and in June 1983 they recorded Friday 13th (January 1984, Picasso PIK 001) at The Marquee, but this comprised old numbers, not new material. Not having a recording contract to promote them, albums were issued on several labels, e.g. Friday 13th was also issued as Live at the Marquee (Great Expectations PIPCD 055) and Talk about a Morning (Dressed to Kill DRESS 600). Later that year, they played the Reading Festival which was recorded for Tommy Vance‚Äôs Friday Rock Show and released as Live at Reading '83 in 1993.Sleevenotes to Live at Reading ‚Äò83 In 1983, they also recorded an album of new material in Germany, but fell out with the producer, who was also the album‚Äôs promoter, so the album was never issued.Sleevenotes to The Twang Dynasty - Point 1997 re-release The first studio album to be issued, The Twang Dynasty, was issued in 1992 and included the track \\"Fast and Dangerous\\", which was used on trailers for Paul Whitehouse‚Äôs Fast Show, although the band were not paid for this. Their performance at 1994‚Äôs Glastonbury Festival was issued as Live 1994 - Official Bootleg (and reissued as Live Official Bootleg), and in 1995 they recorded Call Down the Moon (May 1995) issued on the Hypertension label, and produced by the band and Ron Sanchez ‚Äì a US musician and DJ, who had long championed their cause. Weathers left in 1996, allegedly because Gentle Giant were about to reform, and was replaced by returning drummer Terry Williams, who in the interim, had served in bands such as Dire Straits. Williams recorded some tracks, later released on the Undrugged (May 2002) album, and then Leonard suffered a minor stroke, so the band played a few gigs as a three-piece. When Leonard returned in 1997, Williams left, to be replaced by drummer Bob Richards, formerly of 'The Wild Family' and 'The Adrian Smith Band'. Former keyboardist Phil Ryan returned in 1998, taking the band back to the classic five-piece line-up, which recorded a live double album 1998 at the Star Club (1998) at The Star Club, Oberhausen, West Germany, in March that year. Ryan played a major role in producing Endangered Species (June 2000), but then had to withdraw from the band for personal reasons. Ryan was replaced by Gareth Llewellyn Thorrington, who missed the recording of Down Town Live (2002) at the Down Town Blues Club, Hamburg, in May 2001, as his flight was cancelled due a bomb-scare, but appeared on part of the Undrugged (May 2002) album (an \\"unplugged\\" album with a twist in the title), which had been started in 1996, and was finally issued in 2002. Undrugged has some classic covers, including \\"Sail on, Sailor\\" by the Beach Boys and Ray Charles's \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", both lead vocals being by Micky Jones. In 2002, Micky Jones was diagnosed with a brain tumour and had to take time off for treatment. Jones's place was temporarily taken by his son George Jones, but when Micky had recovered enough to rejoin, in 2004, Leonard decided to leave, again, so George became a permanent member of the band. In 2005, Micky Jones' health deteriorated due to the re-occurrence of his brain tumour and he was replaced by Martin Ace's son Josh Ace. In November 2006, the album Diamonds and Coal was released, after which Thorrington was sacked, and the band continued as a four-piece. The 40th anniversary tour in 2008 saw the return of Ryan on keyboards, giving a multi-generational line-up, with two early members (bassist Martin Ace and keyboardist Phil Ryan), two sons of early members (guitarists George Jones and Josh Ace) and drummer Bob Richards, who had been in the band since 1997. This line-up also recorded a studio album, but before it was mixed, the band split.Announcements on the Manboard Forum Retrieved 26 November 2008 Josh Ace, Martin Ace and Phil Ryan recruited James Beck (guitar, vocals) and Rene Robrahn (drums, vocals) to the new line-up and wiped parts of the album to replace George Jones.

This album, Kingdom of Noise, was finally released in June 2009.[ AllMusic review of Kingdom of Noise, retrieved 21 December 2009] George Jones and Bob Richards formed a new band 'Son of Man', together with Richie Galloni (vocals), Marco James (keyboards) and Ray Jones (bass) from Welsh band Sassafras and Glenn Quinn (guitar) from Tigertailz. As of 2020 they are continuing to play Man's music at gigs around England and Wales, having released Son of Man, an album of new material in October 2016. Their second album State Of Dystopia was released in March 2020. After leaving Man, Micky Jones continued to perform for a while, but was then diagnosed with another tumour; he spent the next year and a half in and out of hospital; his health meant he remained at a care home in Swansea for the next three years until he died peacefully, at the age of 63, on 10 March 2010.

The band consists of Clayton Counts and Neil Keener, with help from various contributors. History =Formation: 2006‚Äì2009= Both key members behind Bull of Heaven started with a variety of earlier projects. Neil Keener was (and in some cases, still is) involved with several punk rock and post- hardcore bands, including Planes Mistaken for Stars, Git Some, Red Cloud West, and Wovenhand. Clayton Counts was also involved in Git Some, before he and Neil moved from Chicago to Denver, where Bull of Heaven was founded. Counts also gained notoriety in September 2006 when he created a mash-up of The Beach Boys‚Äô Pet Sounds with The Beatles‚Äô Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, aptly titled Sgt. Petsound's Lonely Hearts Club Band and credited to the band The Beachles. Various blogs and news sites favoured it; however, Counts was issued with a cease and desist. Bull of Heaven's first piece, 001: Weed Problem, was released on their site on January 31, 2008. The same time the following year, the band had already released more than fifty pieces, totalling nearly three hundred hours of music. Nearly all of Bull of Heaven's song titles are sourced from (sometimes obscure) literature. Even at this early stage in the band's history, they were already becoming known for their incredible song lengths; 019: Hypnosis, Drugs, and Mind Control (The Beginning: A Touch) is eight hours long, 028: Even to the Edge of Doom is twenty-four hours long, 044: A Corpse in My Arms on Awakening breaks the one- day mark at thirty-seven hours long, but is surpassed by 045: The Wicked Cease From Struggling which is one hundred sixty-eight hours long. =2009‚Äì2010= Bull of Heaven in 2009. Between April and May 2009, the band intermittently released a series of one hundred new songs, all named and numbered in Roman numerals. Pieces I ‚Äì C were the first of several breaks from the band's standard three-digit numbering system of releasing music. From September 2009 to January of the following year, the band also started releasing another new series, known as Alephs. The first ten of these contained roughly 1000‚Äì1100 pieces in each sub-folder. Aleph10 and Aleph11 contain one million and ten million pieces respectively. The band gained some acknowledgement in December 2009, when they released 118: The Chosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space, a piece that is over two months long. Like many of their much longer pieces, the band supplied excerpt tracks; but in the case of 118, they supplied three. In January 2010, Clayton Counts talked to The Fly about long players, discussing the various musicians that also delved into extremely long lengths of music, such as John Cage, Robert Rich, and even Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. With this, the band continued creating pieces of equally extreme lengths; pieces 145‚Äì152 all range from fifty to one hundred fifty hours each. In June 2010, the band created another new set of pieces different from the numbered, Aleph, and I ‚Äì C pieces; this was a set of ten untitled folders, each containing thousands of short pieces, named as 32 digits of hexadecimal code. These pieces were not made public, and were only posted in the band's media sub-directory of their website. In July 2010, the band released three very long pieces, the third of which gained them notoriety online, mainly in communities and discussion boards focused around finding the longest piece of music ever made. 208: As You Etch on the Inner Window of Your Eye is nine hundred sixteen hours long, 209: Blurred With Tears and Suffering Beyond Hope four thousand, seven hundred twenty-three hours long, but both are beaten by 210: Like a Wall in Which an Insect Lives and Gnaws, a piece lasting exactly fifty thousand hours. =2010‚Äì2013= Between the end of 2010 and 2011, the band started creating various music puzzles, anti-music, and even lengthier pieces of music. Examples include MP3 files that are actually RAR archives, password-encrypted files, pieces embedded within other formats, such as PDF and EXE, pieces listed with negative song lengths, and a variety of SWF files. In March 2011, the band released a series of pieces of extraordinary lengths. This series, ranging from their numerical ordering of 238‚Äì260, is similar to the Longplayer idea ‚Äì each sound is the length of a prime number, and each subsequent piece creates near-infinite lengths of time before they're synchronized. The final in the series, would last 8,462,937,602,125,701,219,674,955.2362595095 years before all the pieces synchronized. In December 2011, two more extremely long pieces of music were released by the band. 286: 0 and 287: n, the first lasting over twenty-nine million hours, and the latter lasting more than eighty-seven trillion hours. During 2012, the band only released three pieces of music: 288: Four Years Ago? Opium., something of an experimental hip-hop track; 289: CALCULOR, a calculator that doubles as a music generator; and 290: Two-Legged Tigers and Crocodiles, a sound collage piece. In July, the band's site had many downages, and 404 errors, leading to it eventually crashing completely. After a few months, however, the site returned and functionality resumed for the most part. The band took a long hiatus until July 2013, at which time they released several hours of psychedelic rock. It was announced via their Facebook page that more new music would be made available within the year. In September they released a number of drone and post-rock tracks, and in November 299: Self- Traitor, I Do Bring the Spider Love, an hour and twenty minute long jazz fusion arrangement. By the end of 2013, the band had uploaded most of their music to a public domain Internet Archive collection, where all of their newer works reside as they continue to rebuild a new website. =2014‚Äìpresent= In early 2014, the band released a fan-made compilation of love songs, 300: Songs for Girls, followed by 301: Weed Problem II‚ÄìV, and another extremely lengthy piece, 302: It is Part of Space and Time, which runs for at least 86,370,000,000 years. Clayton Counts was interviewed by Vice in the Netherlands, discussing a range of topics related to the band and their sonic approach. On 24 April 2014, psychedelic rock band The Flaming Lips included a reference to Bull of Heaven in the liner notes of the vinyl release of the condensed version of their 24 hr. long piece 7 Skies H3. The Flaming Lips mistakenly call the band \\"Bull in Heaven,\\" but refer to their pieces 118: The Chosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space and 210: Like a Wall in Which an Insect Lives and Gnaws specifically. On 10 July 2014, the band released 305: Hostages are Human Beings. On 12 July 2014, 303: n(k), 304: 0(2^18√ó5^18) and 306: It is Not a Lack of Love were released. On the very next day, they released several other tracks of various lengths. By the time, 310: Œ©Œ£Px0(2^18√ó5^18)p*k*k*k is their longest release, and lasts for 3.343 quindecillion years. In May 2016, Bull of Heaven were featured in a scholastic article entitled \\"Unperformable Works and the Ontology of Music‚Äù in the British Journal of Aesthetics, published by Oxford University Press. On 4 December 2016, Bull of Heaven made a post on their Facebook page announcing the death of member Clayton Counts. On 12 September 2018, Neil released the first new Bull of Heaven piece since Clayton's death, titled \\"Fight Night For The Ghosts Of Heaven.\\" Musical style Bull of Heaven is mostly known for its slow, lengthy, unchanging music. Usually the focus is around dark ambient, minimalism, and drone; however, the band is not limited to just these genres. 237: Disordered Before the Naked Picture of Despair is an avant-garde jazz loop. Similarly, 261: A Feeling for the Order Lying Behind the Appearance is a more traditional progressive rock/avant-garde jazz song. There are elements of spoken word, post-rock, harsh noise, modern classical, drone doom, and many more throughout the band's discography. Live Bull of Heaven has only performed a handful of live shows, notably the Boris Afterparty in Denver in 2010 and at the Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center in St. Louis in 2014.

KRS-One and Marley Marl have since officially retired the feud, with the release of their collaborative 2007 album Hip-Hop Lives. The war begins The feud began with Queensbridge-based producer Marley Marl & MC Shan's track \\"The Bridge\\" in late 1985. The track recited the praises of their home borough and some of its earlier rap crews, and was taken to imply that Queensbridge was where hip hop began, even though it doesn't actually say that. The lyrics that apparently raised the issue were: :You love to hear the story, again and again, :Of how it all got started way back when, :The monument is right in your face, :Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place, :The Bridge, :Queensbridge Though MC Shan states Queensbridge is where his crew got started, and his birthplace, he has stated that he never meant the song to say that Queensbridge is the birthplace of Hip Hop at all, \\"everyone knows that hip hop was started in the West Bronx.\\" Statements can be found in the 2003 documentary Beef, which features the original battle footage. =1986: response= In response, South Bronx-based KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions released the track \\"South Bronx\\", which was similar in terms of content to Shan and Marl's track except singing the praises of the South Bronx rather than Queensbridge, and made the argument for its being the real birthplace of hip hop. The song first premiered at a concert where MC Shan had just performed \\"The Bridge\\". The track directly attacks MC Shan with lyrics like: :Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks, :Ya got dropped off MCA cause the rhymes you wrote was wack, :So you think that hip- hop had its start out in Queensbridge, :If you popped that junk up in the Bronx you might not live Before \\"The Bridge\\" was released, MC Shan was signed to MCA Records. However he left the label after releasing an almost unheard single titled \\"Feed the World\\". Another line by KRS directly attacking Shan was: :So why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are wack, :Instead of trying take out LL, you need to take your homeboys off the crack This referred to the fact that MC Shan had attacked LL Cool J on the B side of \\"The Bridge\\" with a song called \\"Beat Biter\\", whereby Shan claimed that LL Cool J had stolen beats for his \\"Rock The Bells\\" from \\"Marley Marl Scratch\\" theme. LL Cool J never directly responded to this claim, and the impending battle between Shan and BDP drew the attention away from it. Marley Marl later produced most of LL's album Mama Said Knock You Out. Slate described it: \\"In 1986, it was a beef that launched the start of KRS-One, with his withering attacks on MC Shan.\\" Another unnoticed attack is the fact that South Bronx was arranged under the same speed as \\"The Bridge\\", most notably as the rhymes that are performed before the chorus chant. The official story at the time was that KRS-One was defending the reputation of the South Bronx in response to MC Shan and Marley Marl claiming that hip hop started out in Queensbridge. However, KRS-One has gone on record in an interview with MTV, saying that his real motivation was the fact that he and Scott La Rock earlier had approached Mr. Magic with a 12\\" single they had recorded entitled \\"Success Is the Word\\", (under the group name \\"12:41\\"). Magic dismissed it as \\"wack\\", and then, after forming BDP, they retaliated by dissing Mr. Magic and Marley Marl's popular \\"Juice Crew\\", using the whole \\"Queens versus Bronx\\" issue as a pretense. DJ Red Alert also gives a similar version of this story on the CD Beats, Rhymes and Battles Part I. In dialog on that CD (track 5), he states that Magic dissed a track by them. When they heard \\"The Bridge\\", they decided to diss back, and this is why \\"South Bronx\\" was released. =1987: escalation= The Juice Crew soon responded with the track \\"Kill That Noise\\" on Shan's album Down by Law which took various shots at KRS-One and mocked his taking offense in the first place. He even denies saying hip hop started in Queens, and suggests BDP is just trying to jump on their bandwagon. In a more recent interview on THE FOUNDATION (Jayquan), Shan defended and explained the misunderstood line: :JQ : Did you ever say in any song, interview or anywhere that Hip Hop started in Queens ? :Shan : I only said HOW it started in QUEENSBRIDGE, not (all) over the world. The new Source magazine says I still stand on the fact that Hip Hop started in Queens - writers get it twisted. The song the Bridge starts off saying M.C. Shan & Marley Marl in the house tonight - they wanna tell you a story about where THEY come from. But KRS continued to play upon the \\"response to the claim that hip hop started in Queens\\" premise with his next response, \\"The Bridge Is Over\\", featuring lyrics recorded, with a reggae flavor, in a Jamaican accent. The track had been one of the first blendings of rap with reggae, and one section delivered in a sing song fashion modeled after Billy Joel's \\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\\" from his album Glass Houses. Most of KRS's fire was directed specifically at Marley Marl and MC Shan, although the MC added insults to other Juice Crew members such as Mr. Magic and Roxanne Shante, who had earlier been at the center of the Roxanne Wars, which were a predecessor to this battle. Shante, mentioned in a very vulgar reference in \\"the Bridge Is Over\\", released a rap titled \\"Have A Nice Day\\", ghostwritten by Juice Crew colleague Big Daddy Kane (who was not otherwise personally involved in the battle), in which she took a shot at Boogie Down Productions. Shan continues recounting in the FOUNDATION interview: : Mr. Magic dissed BDP and said some stuff about their record on the radio, and he [KRS] made me the target. I wasn't gonna keep ridin' that Kris/Shan thing...people kept sayin \\"why aren't you answering back\\"? I'm like why?...I gave him a career already. After \\"Kill That Noise\\", Shan himself became more passive in the battle, as the above statement indicated. But meanwhile, Two other Queensbridge residents, Rockwell Noel & Poet, joined in the battle, resulting from the inferior responses from MC Shan and the Juice Crew offering the strongest attack against BDP. Their first single was entitled \\"Beat You Down\\", in which he reiterates that no one actually said that hip hop started in the Bridge, but then points out that the area was nevertheless very prominent in the early days of rap, and even had superior sound equipment, causing it to surpass the Bronx as the leader of hip hop. Ending and aftermath In 1987, attempting to calm down an unrelated domestic dispute involving BDP colleague D-Nice, BDP's DJ Scott La Rock was shot dead. Even after La Rock's death, the feud still continued. Other rappers joined in making songs dissing Queensbridge, such as Cool C's \\"Juice Crew Dis\\" which mocked Shan's \\"Juice Crew Law\\" and attacks both Shan and Shant√©, and MitchSki's \\"Brooklyn Blew Up the Bridge, South Bronx Helped us out\\", which made fun of Shan's on-stage appearances. Another rapper named Butchy B stepped in for Queensbridge, with \\"Beat Down KRS\\", in which he among other things, mocks the \\"didadidadiday\\" chant of \\"The Bridge is Over\\". In 1988 DJ Rockwell Noel and the Poet followed up with Taking U Out, which was even stronger than \\"Beat You Down\\", and harshly attacked both KRS's then-wife, Ms. Melodie, and rival radio station WRKS's DJ Red Alert, who was on BDP's side of the battle. KRS responded with \\"Still Number 1, the Numero Uno Mix\\", where he calls Poet \\"soft\\" and uncreative, and accuses him of \\"sounding like Kane\\". Although conspicuously absent from this counterattack was any rebuttal to Poet's attack on his wife. In 1990, Boogie Down Productions released the concept album Edutainment, where KRS-One took on such topics as politics, racism, self- identity, slavery, black on black violence, police brutality & corruption and even the meat industry. On the second track \\"Blackman In Effect\\" he discusses the concept of \\"juice\\" and states: \\"I'm not down with a juice-crew\\". Legacy During the nineties, the beef was not forgotten by fans or the participants, but rather fondly remembered as a classic hip hop rivalry. It has since been referenced in hip hop lyrics by the likes of Cormega, Das EFX, Nas, Cunninlynguists, Big Punisher, Supernatural, Chino XL, Mars ILL, and 2Pac. MC Shan and KRS-One themselves acknowledged the rivalry's important place in hip hop history when they appeared together in a commercial for the Sprite soft drink in the mid-nineties, in which they exchanged battle rhymes inside a boxing ring. However, the respective fortunes of the pair in the nineties were very different; MC Shan was widely seen by hip hop listeners as the loser of the conflict; Despite co-writing and producing \\"Informer\\", a number one hit single for the Canadian reggae singer Snow, Shan never really recovered his reputation and later effectively retired. KRS, meanwhile, forged out a successful solo career and remained an important figure in hip hop. Meanwhile, Poet had moved on, eventually rechristening himself as \\"Blaq Poet\\", and went on to be a part of the groups PHD (Poet + DJ Hot Day), and Screwball; and some of the records released over the years, took numerous pot shots at KRS. PHD's 1991 album title track \\"Without Warning\\" samples a couple of lines from \\"Numero Uno\\" as if answering them. Screwball's \\"The Bio\\" and \\"You Love To Hear The Stories\\" (a followup to the original \\"The Bridge\\", and which featured MC Shan) recounted the story of him entering the battle, and being basically ignored, and that it thankfully never escalated into physical violence; and the latter pointed to the Nas album Illmatic (1994) as proof that \\"the Bridge is still live\\". In 2001, on the compilation QB's Finest (a showcase of Queensbridge hip hop artists), MC Shan took one last parting shot at KRS-One with the comment: :Hip hop was set out in the dark :The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark KRS-One and Marley Marl have since officially retired the feud, with the release of their collaborative 2007 album, Hip-Hop Lives. The album features two tracks further exemplifying the end of the feud: \\"The Victory\\" (produced by DJ Premier) which sees KRS on the same track as Blaq Poet, and \\"Rising\\" (as in \\"Rising To the Top\\"), in which KRS recounts the whole story from his perspective (a struggling former group home resident trying to enter the business in a period when \\"answer records\\" were popular, sparked off by Shante's \\"Roxanne's Revenge\\"). You can see this (and the changed attitude towards the former rivals) in the line: :Answer records were big then; :after Shante did it, everyone was trying to spit them :So we spit on... :To tell you the truth, it was the only way a MC could get on :We answered MC Shan's \\"Queensbridge\\"; :A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived; :But in the Bronx there was these kids :KRS, Scott La Rock tryin' to live... He concludes the track acknowledging his indebtedness to Shan and Marley. He also speaks well of them on other tracks in the album, such as \\"House of Hits\\". KRS had also contributed a verse to the Symphony 2000 remake of the Marley Marl classic in 1999. Queensbridge Records released the 2011 album \\"Bridge Wars\\", which put a new spin on the old story with the release of the compilation which features artists such as F.E.R.N (produced by DukeDaGod of The Diplomats), Mahogany Jones (four-time Champion of BET‚Äôs \\"Freestyle Friday's\\" battle competitions) and Brookyln‚Äôs own L.G. Wise. Nas revisited \\"The Bridge\\" on his 2012 album Life is Good by sampling it for the hook in his track, \\"Back When,\\" which focuses on the past of hip-hop. =2016 Revival with M.C. Shan= In 2016, Shan essentially revived his part of the beef in an interview, pointing out that they never actually battled, and that he was showing some resentment regarding the claim the KRS \\"took Shan out\\" and having to live with the stigma of \\"losing\\" the battle. He would claim he wanted to record a response to The Bridge Is Over, but Marley Marl stopped him. He also included a three-minute freestyle in an over the phone interview. KRS quickly responded.

Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three areas, as cooking was recognized to have three components: social, artistic, and technical. Molecular cuisine is a modern style of cooking, and takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines. The term \\"Molecular and Physical Gastronomy\\" was coined in 1988 by late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti and the French INRA chemist Herv√© This. Some chefs associated with the term choose to reject its use.

History Heated bath used for low temperature cooking Rotary evaporator used in the preparation of distillates and extracts French chemist and cook Herv√© This, known as \\"The Father of Molecular Gastronomy\\" Heston Blumenthal dislikes the term 'molecular gastronomy', believing it makes the practice sound \\"complicated\\" and \\"elitist.\\" There are many branches of food science that study different aspects of food, such as safety, microbiology, preservation, chemistry, engineering and physics. Until the advent of molecular gastronomy, there was no branch dedicated to studying the chemical processes of cooking in the home and in restaurants. Food science has primarily been concerned with industrial food production and, while the disciplines may overlap, they are considered separate areas of investigation. The creation of the discipline of molecular gastronomy was intended to bring together what had previously been fragmented and isolated investigations into the chemical and physical processes of cooking into an organized discipline within food science, to address what the other disciplines within food science either do not cover, or cover in a manner intended for scientists rather than cooks. The term \\"molecular and physical gastronomy\\" was coined in 1988 by Hungarian physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Herv√© This. In 1992, it became the title for a set of workshops held in Erice, Italy (originally titled \\"Science and Gastronomy\\") that brought together scientists and professional cooks for discussions about the science behind traditional cooking preparations. Eventually, the shortened term \\"molecular gastronomy\\" became the name of the approach, based on exploring the science behind traditional cooking methods. Kurti and This considered the creation of a formal discipline around the subjects discussed in the meetings. After Kurti's death in 1998, the name of the Erice workshops were changed by This to \\"The International Workshop on Molecular Gastronomy 'N. Kurti'\\". This remained the sole director of the subsequent workshops from 1999, and continued his research in the field of molecular gastronomy at the Inra-AgroParisTech International Centre for Molecular Gastronomy, remaining in charge of organizing the international meetings. =Precursors= The idea of using techniques developed in chemistry to study food is not a new one, for instance the discipline of food science has existed for many years. Kurti and This acknowledged this fact and though they decided that a new, organized and specific discipline should be created within food science that investigated the processes in regular cooking (as food science was primarily concerned with the nutritional properties of food and developing methods to process food on an industrial scale), there are several notable examples throughout history of investigations into the science of everyday cooking recorded as far as back to 18th century. Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753‚Äì1814) Marie-Antoine Car√™me (1784‚Äì1833) The concept of molecular gastronomy was perhaps presaged by Marie-Antoine Car√™me, one of the most famous French chefs, who said in the early 19th century that when making a food stock \\"the broth must come to a boil very slowly, otherwise the albumin coagulates, hardens; the water, not having time to penetrate the meat, prevents the gelatinous part of the osmazome from detaching itself.\\" Evelyn G. Halliday and Isabel T. Noble In 1943 the University of Chicago Press published a book titled Food Chemistry and Cookery by the then University of Chicago Associate Professor of Home Economics Evelyn G. Halliday and University of Minnesota Associate Professor of Home Economics Isabel T. Noble. In the foreword of the 346-page book, the authors state that, \\"The main purpose of this book is to give an understanding of the chemical principles upon which good practices in food preparation and preservation are based.\\" The book includes chapters such as \\"The Chemistry of Milk\\", \\"The Chemistry of Baking Powders and Their Use in Baking\\", \\"The Chemistry of Vegetable Cookery\\" and \\"Determination of Hydrogen Ion Concentration\\" and contains numerous illustrations of lab experiments including a Distillation Apparatus for Vegetable Samples and a Pipette for Determining the Relative Viscosity of Pectin Solutions. The professors had previously published The Hows and Whys of Cooking in 1928. Belle Lowe In 1932, Belle Lowe, then the professor of Food and Nutrition at Iowa State College, published a book titled Experimental Cookery: From The Chemical And Physical Standpoint which became a standard textbook for home economics courses across the United States. The book is an exhaustively researched look into the science of everyday cooking referencing hundreds of sources and including many experiments. At a length of over 600 pages with section titles such as \\"The Relation Of Cookery To Colloidal Chemistry\\", \\"Coagulation Of Proteins\\", \\"The Factors Affecting The Viscosity Of Cream And Ice Cream\\", \\"Syneresis\\", \\"Hydrolysis Of Collagen\\" and \\"Changes In Cooked Meat And The Cooking Of Meat\\", the volume rivals or exceeds the scope of many other books on the subject, at a much earlier date. Elizabeth Cawdry Thomas Though rarely credited, the origins of the Erice workshops (originally entitled \\"Science and Gastronomy\\") can be traced back to cooking teacher Elizabeth Cawdry Thomas, who studied at Le Cordon Bleu in London and ran a cooking school in Berkeley, California. The one-time wife of a physicist, Thomas had many friends in the scientific community and an interest in the science of cooking. In 1988, while attending a meeting at the Ettore Majorana Center for Scientific Culture in Erice, Thomas had a conversation with Professor Ugo Valdr√® of the University of Bologna, who agreed with her that the science of cooking was an undervalued subject, and encouraged Kurti to organize a workshop at the Ettore Majorana Center. However nothing happened until Kurti met Herv√© This: both approached the director of the Ettore Majorana center, physicist Antonino Zichichi who liked the idea. They invited the food science writer Harold McGee to join them as invited co-director of the first workshops in 1992. =Nicholas Kurti= University of Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti advocated applying scientific knowledge to culinary problems. He was one of the first television cooks in the UK, hosting a black-and-white television show in 1969 entitled The Physicist in the Kitchen, where he demonstrated techniques such as using a syringe to inject hot mince pies with brandy in order to avoid disturbing the crust.How to Dunk a Doughnut: The Science Of Everyday Life, Len Fisher, p.24 That same year, he held a presentation for the Royal Society of London (also entitled \\"The Physicist in the Kitchen\\") in which he stated: Kurti demonstrated making meringue in a vacuum chamber, the cooking of sausages by connecting them across a car battery, the digestion of protein by fresh pineapple juice, and a reverse baked alaska‚Äîhot inside, cold outside‚Äîcooked in a microwave oven. Kurti was also an advocate of low temperature cooking, repeating 18th century experiments by British scientist Benjamin Thompson by leaving a lamb joint in an oven at . After 8.5 hours, both the inside and outside temperature of the lamb joint were around , and the meat was tender and juicy. With his wife, Giana Kurti, Nicholas Kurti edited an anthology on food and science by fellows and foreign members of the Royal Society. =Herv√© This= Herv√© This started collecting \\"culinary precisions\\" (old kitchen wives' tales and cooking tricks) the 24th of March 1980, and started testing these precisions to see which held up; his collection eventually numbered some 25,000. In 1995, he received a PhD in Physical Chemistry of Materials, for which he wrote his thesis on \\"La gastronomie mol√©culaire et physique\\" (molecular and physical gastronomy). He served as an adviser to the French minister of education, lectured internationally, and was invited to join the lab of Nobel-winning molecular chemist Jean-Marie Lehn. This has published several books in French, four of which have been translated into English, including Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor, Kitchen Mysteries: Revealing the Science of Cooking, Cooking: The Quintessential Art, and Building a Meal: From Molecular Gastronomy to Culinary Constructivism. He currently publishes a series of essays in French, and hosts free monthly seminars on molecular gastronomy at the INRA in France. He gives free and public seminars on molecular gastronomy every month, and annually gives a public and free course on molecular gastronomy. Herv√© This also authors a website and a pair of blogs on the subject in French, and publishes monthly collaborations with French chef Pierre Gagnaire on Gagnaire's website. Objectives The objectives of molecular gastronomy, as defined by Herv√© This, are seeking for the mechanisms of culinary transformations and processes (from a chemical and physical point of view) in three areas: #the social phenomena linked to culinary activity #the artistic component of culinary activity #the technical component of culinary activity The original fundamental objectives of molecular gastronomy were defined by This in his doctoral dissertation as: #Investigating culinary and gastronomical proverbs, sayings and old wives' tales #Exploring existing recipes #Introducing new tools, ingredients and methods into the kitchen #Inventing new dishes #Using molecular gastronomy to help the general public understand the contribution of science to society Herv√© This later recognized points 3, 4, and 5 as being not entirely scientific endeavors (more application of technology and educational), and has revised the list. =Areas of investigation= Prime topics for study include *How ingredients are changed by different cooking methods *How all the senses play their own roles in our appreciation of food *The mechanisms of aroma release and the perception of taste and flavor *How and why we evolved our particular taste and flavor sense organs and our general food likes and dislikes *How cooking methods affect the eventual flavor and texture of food ingredients *How new cooking methods might produce improved results of texture and flavor *How our brains interpret the signals from all our senses to tell us the \\"flavor\\" of food *How our enjoyment of food is affected by other influences, our environment, our mood, how it is presented, who prepares it, etc. Chefs Grant Achatz shown plating a dish at Alinea, has been called the leading American chef in molecular gastronomy.\\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2058044_2060338_2059872,00.html\\". Time. April 4, 2011. Homaro Cantu of Moto Restaurant was a molecular gastronomer. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term started to be used to describe a new style of cooking in which some chefs began to explore new possibilities in the kitchen by embracing science, research, technological advances in equipment and various natural gums and hydrocolloids produced by the commercial food processing industry.Le Sanctuaire Store - Category Molecular Gastronomy It has since been used to describe the food and cooking of a number of famous chefs, though many of them do not accept the term as a description of their style of cooking. Chefs who are often associated with molecular gastronomy because of their embrace of science include Heston Blumenthal, Grant Achatz, Ferran Adri√†, Jos√© Andr√©s, Sat Bains, Richard Blais, Marcel Vigneron, Sean Brock, Homaro Cantu, Michael Carlson, Wylie Dufresne, Pierre Gagnaire, Adam Melonas, Kevin Sousa, and Laurent Gras. Despite their central role in the popularisation of science-based cuisine, both Adria and Blumenthal have expressed their frustration with the common mis-classification of their food and cooking as \\"molecular gastronomy\\", On 10 December 2006 Blumenthal and Harold McGee published a 'Statement on the \\"New Cookery\\" in the Observer in order to summarise what they saw as the central tenets of modern cuisine. Ferran Adria of El Bulli and Thomas Keller of the French Laundry and Per Se signed up to this and together released a joint statement in 2006 clarifying their approach to cooking, stating that the term \\"molecular gastronomy\\" was coined in 1992 for a single workshop that did not influence them, and that the term does not describe any style of cooking. In February 2011, Nathan Myhrvold published the Modernist Cuisine, which led many chefs to further classify molecular gastronomy versus modernist cuisine. Myhrvold believes that his cooking style should not be called molecular gastronomy.

March 26, 2008 Alternative names and related pursuits The term molecular gastronomy was originally intended to refer only to the scientific investigation of cooking, though it has been adopted by a number of people and applied to cooking itself or to describe a style of cuisine. Ferran Adri√† of El Bulli, prefers the term 'deconstructivist' to describe his style of cooking. Other names for the style of cuisine practiced by these chefs include: *Avant-garde cuisine *Culinary constructivism *Cocina de vanguardia ‚Äì term used by Ferran Adri√† *Emotional cuisineEl Celler de Can Roca The World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards 2011 *Experimental cuisine *Forward-thinking movement ‚Äì term used at Grant Achatz's AlineaAlinea Biographies *Kitchen science *Modern cuisineRestaurant Luomo Helsinki, Finland *Modernist cuisine, which shares its name with a cookbook, and which is endorsed by Ferran Adri√† of El Bulli and David Chang *Molecular cuisine *Molecular cooking *New cuisine *New cookery *Nueva cocina *Progressive cuisine *Techno-emotional cuisine‚Äîterm preferred by elBulli research and development chef Ferran Adri√† *Technologically forward cuisine *Vanguard cuisine *Techno-cuisine No singular name has ever been applied in consensus, and the term \\"molecular gastronomy\\" continues to be used often as a blanket term to refer to any and all of these things‚Äîparticularly in the media. Ferran Adri√† hates the term \\"molecular gastronomy\\" and prefers 'deconstructivist' to describe his style of cooking. A 2006 open letter by Ferran Adria, Heston Blumenthal, Thomas Keller and Harold McGee published in The Times used no specific term, referring only to \\"a new approach to cooking\\" and \\"our cooking\\".

De Blainville included in his group many unicellular forms, sea anemones, corals, jellyfish, hydroid polyps, echinoderms, polyzoa, and rotifera. Thomas Huxley afterwards applied the term in a restricted sense. He showed that within de Blainville's group, along with a number of heterogeneous forms, there was a group of animals characterized by being composed of two layers of cells comparable with the first two layers in the development of vertebrate animals. These he called Coelentera, and showed that they had no special affinity with echinoderms, polyzoa, etc. He further divided the Coelentera into a group Hydrozoa, in which the sexually produced embryos were usually set free from the surface of the body, and a group Actinozoa, in which the embryos are detached from the interior of the body and escape generally by the oral aperture. Huxley's Actinozoa comprised the sea-anemones, corals and sea pens, on the one hand, and the Ctenophora (comb jellies) on the other. Modern biology confirms Huxley's criticism of De Blainville's Actinozoa, and upholds Hydrozoa, but it is now known that the Ctenophora are only distantly related to jellyfish and their relatives, so Huxley's Actinozoa and Coelentera are no longer used (though the name Actinozoa is occasionally applied to the Anthozoa). Modern taxonomies place the comb jellies in their own phylum Ctenophora and the jellyfish, sea anemones, and Hydrozoa together in the phylum Cnidaria.

The first is jihad, which is also important to the Sunni, but not considered a pillar. The second is Commanding what is just (), which calls for every Muslim to live a virtuous life and to encourage others to do the same.

It is a physical, mental, and spiritual act of worship that is observed five times every day at prescribed times. When they do this, they must face Kaaba in Mecca. In this ritual, the worshiper starts standing, bows, prostrates themselves, and concludes while sitting on the ground. During each posture, the worshiper recites or reads certain verses, phrases and prayers. The word salah is commonly translated as \\"prayer\\" or \\"communication to Allah\\". The prophet Muhammad described salat as the \\"centerpole\\" of the religion. The main meaning of salat in Arabic is to pray or bless. Salat has been classified into two basic kinds: required and recommended. The required salat is the second Pillar, while other salats are considered as recommended ones. The primary required salat is performed five times a day in the specified periods. Sawm (Fast) Fasting in Islam refers to completely refrain from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity during the day from dawn to dusk. It is required to fast during the month of Ramadan. All Muslims who are in the coming of age have to fast, although there are a number of exceptions to not fasting, such as illness and travel, pregnancy and menstruating. Missed fasting needs to be practiced in another time. There are some verses as to fasting in Quran such as \\"The month of Ramadhan is that in which the Qur'an was revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction; therefore, whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; God desires ease for you, and does not desire for you difficulty, and (desires) that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of God for having guided you and that you may give thanks.\\" Hajj (Pilgrimage) The Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey and can support their family during their absence.Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs - Islam See drop-down essay on \\"Islamic Practices\\" In Islamic terminology, Hajj is a pilgrimage made to Kaaba, the ‚ÄòHouse of God‚Äô, in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The rites of Hajj begin on the eighth and ending on the thirteenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions. The Hajj is associated with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: Each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. After the sacrifice of their animal, the Pilgrims then are required to shave their head. Then they celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.Sahih Bukhari-hadith No-732-733 Zakah (Charity) According to Chittick, The root of Zakat is purity means that people purify their property by paying a share of it to Allah. To be more precise, Zakat is defined as a determined percentage of one's acquired property or profit for the year that is paid to the needy who is described by Quran the poor, those who collect the zakat, those whose hearts are to be reconciled to Islam, captives, those in debt, those who are fighting for Allah, and travelers. Khums (One-fifth) Khums, in the Ja'fari Shia tradition, is applied to the business profit, or surplus, of a business income. It is payable at the beginning of the financial year, though this is regarded as being the time at which the amount becomes clear. Ghanima and one- fifth tax of khums applies wherever gain or profit is involved. \\"Ghanima\\" has two meanings as mentioned above; the second meaning is illustrated by the common use of the Islamic banking term \\"al-ghunm bil-ghurm\\" meaning \\"gains accompany liability for loss or risk\\"Glossary of Islamic Banking Terms In 13th century Shia region, the khums was divided into two portions. One portion went to the descendants of Muhammad, the other portion was divided equally and one part given to Imam and clergy, while the other part went to the orphaned and poor Muslims.John L. Esposito (2004), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Oxford University Press, , p. 174 The famous view of contemporary Faqihs is that Imam's portion (during the Occultation (Islam)) is used in the fields that Marja' Taqlid has valid knowledge/doubt that if the infallible Imam would be apparent, he would use it in those ways, such as reinforcing Islam and Seminary, Islam promotion, building mosques in necessary situations, libraries and schools' affairs, handling old people, and actually all blessing affairs in the order of priority and their religious significance.Borujerdi, Al- Mustanad Fi Sharh Orwatol-Wuthqa, P. 330 Khums became a major source of income and financial independence of the clergy in Shia regions. This practice has continued among Shia Muslims. Jihad (Struggle) Jihad literally means Struggling . In an Islamic context, it can refer to almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God's guidance, such as struggle against one's evil inclinations, proselytizing, or efforts toward the moral betterment of the ummah, though it is most frequently associated with war. In classical Islamic law, the term refers to armed struggle against unbelievers, while modernist Islamic scholars generally equate military jihad with defensive warfare.  Tawalla and Tabarra  Expressing love towards Ali and the house of Muhammad prophet means Tawalla and Tabarra is introduced as showing avoidance of the enemies of the house of the prophet. This rule are connected to social, military and political challenge. Based on these two principles, unity is establishing in society by following truth, justice, freedom, purity and the impure, oppressive, and the unjust ones are stopped.

Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Early life He was born at Bristol. His father was a mason and builder at Chorley, Lancashire, and he himself began his engineering education by working in a stonemason's yard. Career In 1831, he obtained employment under Jesse Hartley in the engineers office at the Liverpool docks, and for four years from 1836 he was engaged under Robert Stephenson as assistant resident engineer for the Blisworth section of what is now the London & North-Western main line from London to the North. Returning to Liverpool, he spent some years as assistant-surveyor to the corporation, and then in 1844 accepted an engineering post on the Bridgewater Canal. Three years later he returned to Liverpool, to superintend the design and construction of the famous brick- arched ceiling in the St George's Hall, in succession to, his friend H. L. Elmes. During this period Rawlinson's reputation as a sanitarian had been growing. In 1847 he devised a scheme to supply from Bala Lake in Gwynedd, Wales to Liverpool. When the Public Health Act was passed in 1848 he was appointed one of the first inspectors under it. He inspected many of the chief towns of England, and his reports on the sanitary conditions he found brought him in many cases into great unpopularity with the municipal rulers. Early in 1855 popular feeling was so aroused by the waste of life that was going on among the British troops in the Crimea through disease, and by the mismanagement of the campaign, that the Aberdeen ministry was forced to resign. Lord Palmerston, who then became prime minister, sent a sanitary commission, consisting of Rawlinson and two medical members (Dr. John Sutherland and Dr. Hector Gavin), with full powers from the War Office, to do whatever it thought would lead to better hygienic conditions in camp and hospital. The commission reached Constantinople in March, and, by insisting on what now seem the most obvious precautions, succeeded within a few weeks in reducing the death-rate in the Levantine hospitals from 42 to 2¬º%. Passing on to the Crimea, it effected a similar improvement there, and by the end of the year the health of the whole British army in the field was even better than it enjoyed at home. Rawlinson's next great public service, for which he was made C.B. in 1865, was in connection with the distress caused in Lancashire by the collapse of the cotton manufacturing industry consequent on the American Civil War. In 1863 it was suggested that, to provide employment for the starving operatives, the government should start works of utility, profit and ornament, and Rawlinson being sent to make an official investigation into the question, reported, after visiting nearly 100 towns, that 1/2 million sterling might be advantageously expended in providing water-supply and drainage, forming streets, etc., in those places. The result was that the Treasury was authorised to advance 1,200,000 the amount was afterwards increased) for carrying out such works, which proved of enormous public benefit. In 1866 he acted as chairman of the Royal Commission on the Pollution of Rivers, and a few years later was appointed chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board; on retiring from this position in 1888 be was promoted to be KCB. Between May 1894 and May 1895 he served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Family and personal life Rawlinson died in London on 31 May 1898 and is buried there in Brompton Cemetery on the side of the main entrance path from the north gate. He had married, in 1831, Ruth Swallow, daughter of Thomas Swallow, of Lockwood, Huddersfield. Lady Rawlinson died at her residence in West Brompton on 18 August 1902, aged 91. Rawlinson amassed a sizebale art collection, including 5 paintings by Richard Ansdell and 3 paintings and 5 watercolours by Richard Dadd, which were sold in 1903, after his wife¬¥s death.Christie's, London, 18 May 1903, lots 52 to 158.

He is primarily a bowler but can contribute useful runs near the bottom of the order on occasion; as of 2005 he has a highest first-class score of 48. His fielding is also very good, particularly his catching. International career The 2001 ICC Trophy was held in Canada and Codrington played in three matches, all in Toronto, but took only two wickets. After making appearances in the 2001-02 ICC 6 Nations Challenge in Namibia and the 2002‚Äì03 Red Stripe Bowl in St Lucia, he was part of the Canadian team that participated in the 2003 World Cup and made an immediate impression. The game against Test side Bangladesh at Durban was Canada's first One Day International for 24 years, since the 1979 World Cup. After chipping in with 16 to help his side to 180 all out (at the time Canada's highest total in ODIs) Codrington claimed 5-27 from nine overs to reduce the Bangladeshis from the relative comfort of 106/4 to 120 all out and guide Canada to their first win at this level, as well as claiming the best innings figures for Canada in ODIs. Codrington played in four of Canada's other five matches in that World Cup, but did not manage to repeat his success, picking up only one more wicket and suffering the humiliation of playing in the side bowled out for 36 by Sri Lanka; this was the lowest-ever ODI total until Zimbabwe beat it by one run in 2004. Further appearances at List A level followed in the 2003‚Äì04 Red Stripe Bowl and 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge, as well as the non-List A ICC Americas Championship. Codrington was not selected for either the 2005 ICC Trophy or the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup, but did return to the Canadian team in August 2006 for the ODIs against Bermuda and the subsequent ICC Americas Championship tournament. He was not selected on their tour to South Africa in November/December however. Domestic career In August 2004, Codrington made his first-class debut against Bermuda in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, hitting 48 in his only innings but taking just one wicket in a drawn game. In the semi-final of the competition in November, against the UAE at Sharjah, he made 42 in the second innings and claimed three wickets. He was retained for the final against Scotland at the same venue four days later, but was out for 1 in both innings and took only one wicket as Canada were crushed by an innings and 84 runs.

It explains Feuerbach's philosophy and critique of religion.  Influence  The book is often considered a classic of humanism and the author's magnum opus. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were strongly influenced by the book, although they criticised Feuerbach for his inconsistent espousal of materialism. Feuerbach's theory of alienation would later be used by Marx in his theory of alienation. Max Stirner directed his The Ego and Its Own against it. Rather than simply a polemic, Stirner's work uses Feuerbach's idea of God as a human abstraction as the basis of his critique of Feuerbach.  In the consciousness of the infinite  Feuerbach's theme was a derivation of Hegel's speculative theology in which the Creation remains a part of the Creator, while the Creator remains greater than the Creation. When the student Feuerbach presented his own theory to professor Hegel, Hegel refused to reply positively to it. In Part I of his book, Feuerbach developed what he calls the \\"true or anthropological essence of religion\\", treating of God in his various aspects \\"as a being of the understanding\\", \\"as a moral being or law\\", \\"as love\\" and so on. Feuerbach talks of how man is equally a conscious being, more so than God because man has placed upon God the ability of understanding. Man contemplates many things and in doing so he becomes acquainted with himself. Feuerbach shows that in every aspect God corresponds to some feature or need of human nature. \\"If man is to find contentment in God\\", he writes, \\"he must find himself in God.\\" Thus God is nothing else than man: he is, so to speak, the outward projection of man's inward nature. This projection is dubbed as a chimera by Feuerbach, that God and the idea of a higher being is dependent upon the aspect of benevolence. Feuerbach states that, \\"a God who is not benevolent, not just, not wise, is no God\\", and continues to say that qualities are not suddenly denoted as divine because of their godly association. The qualities themselves are divine therefore making God divine, indicating that man is capable of understanding and applying meanings of divinity to religion and not that religion makes a man divine. The force of this attraction to religion though, giving divinity to a figure like God, is explained by Feuerbach as God is a being that acts throughout man in all forms. God, \\"is the principle of [man's] salvation, of [man's] good dispositions and actions, consequently [man's] own good principle and nature\\". It appeals to man to give qualities to the idol of their religion because without these qualities a figure such as God would become merely an object, its importance would become obsolete, there would no longer be a feeling of an existence for God. Therefore, Feuerbach says, when man removes all qualities from God, \\"God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being\\". Additionally, because man is imaginative, God is given traits and there holds the appeal. God is a part of man through the invention of a God. Equally though, man is repulsed by God because, \\"God alone is the being who acts of himself\\". In part 2 he discusses the \\"false or theological essence of religion\\", i.e. the view which regards God as having a separate existence over against man. Hence arise various mistaken beliefs, such as the belief in revelation which he believes not only injures the moral sense, but also \\"poisons, nay destroys, the divinest feeling in man, the sense of truth\\", and the belief in sacraments such as the Lord's Supper, which is to him a piece of religious materialism of which \\"the necessary consequences are superstition and immorality.\\" A caustic criticism of Feuerbach was delivered in 1844 by Max Stirner. In his book Der Einzige und sein Eigentum (The Ego and Its Own) he attacked Feuerbach as inconsistent in his atheism. (See External links)  Editions  German * (1841) First.

A right-handed pitcher, Lidle spent nine seasons in Major League Baseball with seven different teams. Lidle was killed when the small aircraft he owned crashed into a residential building in New York City. Baseball career =Early career: 1990‚Äì97= Lidle graduated from South Hills High School in West Covina, California in 1990 and was signed in 1990 by the Minnesota Twins as an amateur free agent. He was released in 1993 and spent a season playing for the unaffiliated Pocatello Posse in Idaho while bartending. After one season in Pocatello, he was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers. Due to his participation as a replacement player during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, he was ineligible to join the Major League Baseball Players Association. He was then traded in 1996 to the New York Mets, with whom he made his major league debut on May 8, 1997. =Later career: 1999‚Äì2006= Lidle later appeared for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. His best season was 2001, when he achieved a 13-6 record with a 3.59 ERA (10th in the American League) for Oakland, helping the Athletics win the wild card. His career zenith occurred in August 2002, when he gave up only one run during the whole month (setting Oakland's record for consecutive innings without an earned run), won all five of his starts, and was one of the prime movers in the A's historic run of 20 straight wins. It was on this Oakland team where he earned the nickname \\"Snacks\\", for his apparent love of \\"inhaling\\" junk food in the bullpen.Michael Urban, \\"Chavez clutch in A's 17th straight\\" from MLB.com, August 31, 2002. In 2007, Lidle was posthumously inducted into the Binghamton Baseball Shrine since he had played for the Double-A Binghamton Mets (New York Mets). =As a Yankee: 2006= On July 30, 2006, Lidle was traded along with outfielder Bobby Abreu from the Philadelphia Phillies to the New York Yankees for minor league shortstop C. J. Henry, the Yankees' first round pick in the 2005 draft, along with left-handed reliever Matt Smith, minor league catcher Jes√∫s S√°nchez, and minor league right-hander Carlos Monasterios. After being traded, he criticized his former team: \\"On the days I'm pitching, it's almost a coin flip as to know if the guys behind me are going to be there to play 100 percent.\\" He noted he was joining a Yankee team that expects to win all the time: \\"That's why I'm most excited about it. Sometimes I felt I got caught up kind of going into the clubhouse nonchalantly sometimes, because all the other guys in the clubhouse didn't go there with one goal in mind.\\"Associated Press, \\"Lidle backs off criticism, but Rhodes keeps firing\\" from ESPN.com, August 2, 2006. In his first start for the Yankees, he went six innings, giving up one run on four hits, en route to an 8-1 Yankee victory as part of a sweep against the Toronto Blue Jays.Associated Press, \\"Lidle pitches in Yankees sweep from Boston.com, August 4, 2006. On August 21, 2006, he went six three-hit shutout innings, completing an improbable five-game sweep (in four days) over the then second place Boston Red Sox (who went from games behind to games behind).ESPN Wire Services, \\"Yanks finish Boston beatdown, sweep five-game series\\" from ESPN.com, August 21, 2006. On October 7, in his final game (Game 4 of the 2006 ALDS), he lasted only an inning and a third, allowing three earned runs on four hits as the Yankees lost to the Detroit Tigers, 8-3. He was criticized for telling a reporter, \\"We got matched up with a team that, I think, was a little more ready to play than we were,\\" which was taken by some as a jab at manager Joe Torre. For damage control, he called the radio talk show Mike and the Mad Dog and gave an extended defense of himself and the Yankees. The snippy exchange was punctuated by co-host Chris Russo's implication that Lidle was not entitled to \\"enjoy a day in New York\\" and co-host Mike Francesa commenting, \\"I haven't thought much about you at all, to be honest with you.\\" Following reports of his death, both hosts of the popular New York radio show expressed remorse for their hostility to him.Neil Best, \\"Francesa feels haunted by Lidle interview\\" from Newsday, October 12, 2006.Andrew Marchand, \\"Interview got ugly\\" from the New York Post, October 12, 2006. Scouting report Lidle threw an 88‚Äì90 mph fastball with cut and sink. He threw a low-70s curveball to keep hitters off balance, and a low-80s slider. He was a finesse pitcher who had to rely on changing speeds and pinpoint location. Personal life Lidle was married and had one son. He and his wife, Melanie (nee Varela), were married in 1997. Their son, Christopher Taylor Lidle, was born September 18, 2000. Lidle was a descendant of Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat, as reflected in his middle name. Lidle's twin brother, Kevin, also played baseball, as a catcher and pitcher for various minor league teams between 1992 and 2002, and for an independent team in 2005. Death On October 11, 2006, Lidle and co-pilot/flight instructor Tyler Stanger were flying a Cirrus SR20 airplane when it crashed into the Belaire Apartments complex at 527 East 72nd Street on New York City's Upper East Side, killing them both. The plane was flying above the East River past the Queensboro Bridge toward restricted airspace. A strong wind from the east due to an incoming front caused the plane to be blown into the building as it was making a 180-degree turn. In addition to the deaths of Lidle and Stanger, 26 were injured in the accident, about half of them New York City firefighters. Lidle was the third Yankee to die in a plane crash. The prior two were catcher Thurman Munson (on August 2, 1979) and pitcher Jim Hardin (on March 9, 1991). Yankees owner George Steinbrenner described Lidle's death as a \\"terrible and shocking tragedy that has stunned the entire Yankees organization\\" and offered his condolences to Lidle's wife and six-year-old son.\\"Investigators go over Lidle crash scene\\", Hajela, Deepti, Associated Press. October 12, 2006 On October 12, 2006, before the 2006 NLCS game in New York City between the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals, both teams and all spectators observed a moment of silence in Lidle's memory.ALCS Game 3 on Friday afternoon; NLCS Game 2 at night, Associated Press. October 12, 2006. The Yankees wore black armbands during the entire 2007 season in memory of Lidle. On April 2, 2007, Cory's widow Melanie and his son Christopher both threw the ceremonial first pitch on Opening Day at Yankee Stadium. Melanie Lidle attended the 2007 graduation ceremony at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California. The community college's aviation team flew across the graduation field during the ceremony to pay respect to both Lidle and Stanger. Lidle is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park - Covina Hills, in Covina, California. One of the baseball fields at West Covina's Cortez Park is named \\"Cory Lidle Field\\" in his memory.

He was born in Comminges, into a poor family, and his father (a soldier) was killed when he was seven. He spent some time in the court of Marguerite of Navarre, traveled to Toulouse and Bordeaux (where he met George Buchanan), and then to Paris where he came into contact with members of the young literary generation, including Pierre de Ronsard, Jean Antoine de Ba√Øf, Jean Dorat, Remy Belleau, Antoine Du Verdier and Odet de Turn√®be. In 1568 he became historiographer to the king. He died in Paris. Belleforest wrote on cosmography, morals, literature and history, and he translated the works of Matteo Bandello, Boccaccio, Antonio de Guevara, Lodovico Guicciardini, Polydore Vergil, Saint Cyprian, Sebastian M√ºnster, Achilles Tatius, Cicero and Demosthenes into French. He is also the author of the first French pastoral novel, La Pyr√©n√©e (or La Pastorale amoureuse) (1571) modeled on the Diana of Jorge de Montemayor. His Grandes Annales are a polemic tract against Fran√ßois Hotman. His total output comprises more than 50 volumes.

It is located in the Entre R√≠os province, on the western shore of the Uruguay River, some 320 kilometers north from Buenos Aires. Its population is about 80,000 inhabitants (). History The city was founded on June 25, 1783 by Tom√°s de Rocamora. Rich in ancient monuments, it is sometimes referred to as La Hist√≥rica (\\"The Historical\\") due to is participation in the national formation process. The Palacio San Jos√©, the old personal residence of caudillo Justo Jos√© de Urquiza is located only 23 km from Concepci√≥n. = Background = A populated area known as Arroyo de China (which had no foundation), was recorded in approximately 1778 and located north of the namesake creek in what are now the neighborhoods of Puerto Viejo and La Concepci√≥n in the extreme south of the city. The same year the first chapel was erected at a place that would subsequently be used as a cemetery. = Foundation = Commissioned by the viceroy of V√©rtiz and Juan Jose Salcedo, Thomas Rocamora founded the town of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of Uruguay on 25 June 1783, lifting the first town north of the existing population to what is now the administrative and commercial centre of the city. There are discussions about the full name of the city, as some versions say it was merely Concepci√≥n del Uruguay. = Epicentre of the national scene = In 1810, aware of the movement that had been raised in Buenos Aires, the city was the first to join the cause of the Revolution. In 1814 the Supreme Director Gervasio Antonio Posadas, using the extraordinary powers given by the Constituent Assembly, named Concepci√≥n del Uruguay as the capital of the province of Entre R√≠os at the time of its creation. On June 29, 1815, General Jos√© Gervasio Artigas convened the first congress independence, which was held in the city with the name of Congress East. It was meant for the declaration of independence Argentina and the adoption of the flag created by Belgrano straddles the currency punz√≥-red diagonal stripe symbolizing federalism. It was also decided not to attend Congress of Tucum√°n to be held the following year as a sign of protest toward Directory (unit) to promote the Portuguese invasion in Banda Oriental and attacks on federal deputies. On February 1, 1820, General Francisco Ram√≠rez, allied with the governor of Santa Fe Estanislao L√≥pez, who commanded the federal army defeated Jos√© Rondeau at the battle of Cepeda, shortly after signing the Treaty of Pilar. Subsequently, Ram√≠rez was distanced from L√≥pez and September 29 of that year, proclaimed the Republic of Entre R√≠os, which included addition to the existing provinces of Corrientes and Misiones, Concepci√≥n being the capital of Uruguay. But the life of this republic would be short-lived, since they would disband with the death of Ram√≠rez on July 10, 1821. In 1826, General Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, in his role as the governor of Entre Rios, promoted the law that gave Concepci√≥n del Uruguay range city. In 1848 Urquiza created in the City College of Uruguay, first in the country of secular character. In 1851, at the foot of the pyramid's central Plaza, General Francisco Ramirez, the pronouncement of Urquiza took place against Juan Manuel de Rosas, an act that would lead to the battle of Caseros on February 3, 1852, in which Urquiza was the winner and which paved the way for enactment of the National Constitution the following year. Also in 1852, troops from Buenos Aires led by General Madariaga disembark frustrated with the aim of taking the city. The Provincial Convention gathered in the city in 1860 to punish the provincial Constitution again declare the provincial capital, which would function until the year of the centennial, 1883, when the capital was finally moved to the city of Paran√°. On January 1, 1873 the town was formally created. Also the same year, during the boom of normalcy, Sarmiento created in the city the second Normal School in the country, after the first of Paran√° and women. = Late 19th and early 20th century = June 30, 1887 was enabled the rail link across the line which is then integrated into the General Urquiza Rail with the cities of Paran√°, Nogoy√° and Rosario del Tala. Also that year was reformed port, which in 1910 reached their best time from his office be one of the most important country. = Industrial development = Throughout the twentieth century, the city continued to hold importance to cultural and economic level, adding to the processes of industrialization underway in the country and settling their major industries. In 1994, the swearing of the Constitutional Reform was held at the Palacio San Jos√©. Climate Uruguayenses To distinguish its citizens from Uruguayan nationals, people from Concepci√≥n del Uruguay are called uruguayenses, while Uruguayans are known as uruguayos. Economic life Today the city has three major industries: the port, the industrial park (poultry, woods, auto-parts) and the state administration (including five faculties). The Uruguay Department produces 47% of the nation's poultry, and Concepci√≥n del Uruguay together with Gualeguay and Col√≥n make up 85% of Argentine chicken exports. Secondary school, circa 1900. Education The city has four universities, of which three are public (two national and one provincial) and the other one is private. They totalled ten faculties, thereby providing a broad academic offerings in different areas. In turn, two of the aforementioned institutions have headquarters in the city of his rectory, confirming its importance as the largest educational center in the region.

Lockets are usually given to loved ones on holidays such as Valentine's Day and occasions such as christenings, weddings and, most noticeably during the Victorian Age, funerals. Historically, they often opened to reveal a portrait miniature. Lockets are generally worn on chains around the neck and often hold a photo of the person who gave the locket, or they could form part of a charm bracelet. They come in many shapes such as ovals, hearts and circles and are usually made of precious metals such as gold or silver befitting their status as decorative jewellery. Lockets usually hold only one or two photographs, but some specially made lockets can hold up to eight. Some lockets have been fashioned as 'spinner' lockets, where the bail that attaches to the necklace chain is attached but not fixed to the locket itself which is free to spin. This was a common style in the Victorian Age. Around 1860 memento lockets started to replace mourning rings as the preferred style of mourning jewellery. Keepsake lockets can also be made with a glass pane at the front so that what is inside can be seen without opening the locket. Such lockets are generally used for items like locks of hair which could fall out and become lost if the locket were repeatedly opened, whereas photograph lockets are generally enclosed on all sides and the photographs are secured by pieces of clear plastic. Another kind of locket still made was in a filigree style with a small cushion in the centre to which a few drops of perfume should be added. Perfume lockets were popular in eras when personal hygiene was restricted and sweet smelling perfume was used to mask the odour of a person or their companions. Very rare World War I- and World War II-era British and American military uniform locket buttons exist, containing miniature working compasses.

It has significant Polish minority population in Lithuania, with about 30% of the population claiming Polish ethnicity. History The Trakai district became significant early in its history due to the Old Trakai Castle built by the Grand Duke Gediminas in the 13th century. Many other castles were built in the area soon after this one, including the Trakai Peninsula Castle and the Trakai Island Castle. For many years, it has been distinguished from much of the rest of Lithuania in having other ethnic groups such as Karaims, Tatars, Russians and Poles living in the vicinity. Settlements Trakai Peninsula castle Trakai was an area holding great significance in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Trakai region began to decline politically and economically in the 16th century. During the wars with Russia, Trakai was continually attacked and razed. It has been rebuilt and many celebrations are held there annually once again. The city is often portrayed on Lithuanian stamps because of its beauty and illustrious history. It has become an important district in Lithuania once again.

Usul al-d√≠n is an Arabic Islamic term which literally translates as 'principles of the faith', roughly interpretable as 'theology'. Definition The Shia roots of religion are a set of theological beliefs, in contrast to the ten practices prescribed in the Shia ancillaries of the faith. =Resalah= All books of Resalah start with an explicit disclaimer stating that no proof shall be given for any of the points in the Usul al-d√≠n. The Marja argue that it is permissible to imitate in matters of practical Islam, for example, how one is supposed to do Salat, without being familiar with evidence and arguments for the conclusions. However, they argue that the matters in the roots of religion are much too important to be merely imitated, and it is the responsibility of each individual to make themselves personally familiar with the arguments and evidence for each article of faith. Articles of faith There are five articles of faith in the Shia roots of religion. =Tawhid (oneness)= Tawhid (, also spelled Tauhid or Tawheed) is the Islamic concept of monotheism. In Arabic, Taw·∏•ƒ´d means \\"unification, i.e. to unify or to keep something unified as one.\\" In Islam, Taw·∏•ƒ´d means to assert the unity of God, it is not just unity of God Almighty but also Uniqueness, as defined in Quran surah 112, He is not born of anyone nor gave birth to any one, nor is any one like Him. The opposite of Taw·∏•ƒ´d is shirk, which means \\"Association\\" in Arabic. Muslims view polytheism and idolatry as shirk. According to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ali, the first Shia Imam, is credited with having established Islamic theology and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the Unity of God. Ali expresses that \\"God is One\\" means that he is away from likeness and numeration and he is not divisible even in imagination. He says: > \\"The first step of religion is to accept, understand and realize him as the > Lord... The correct form of belief in his unity is to realize that he is so > absolutely pure and above nature that nothing can be added to or subtracted > from his being. That is, one should realize that there is no difference > between his person and his attributes, and his attributes should not be > differentiated or distinguished from his person. \\" Therefore, Twelvers believe God is alone in being, along with his names, his attributes, his actions, his theophanies. The totality of being therefore is he, through him, comes from him, and returns to him. God is not a being next to or above other beings, his creatures; he is being, the absolute act of being (wujud mutlaq). For, if there were being other than he (i.e., creatural being), God would no longer be the Unique, i.e., the only one to be. As this Divine Essence is infinite, his qualities are the same as his essence, Essentially there is one Reality which is one and indivisible. The border between theoretical Tawhid and Shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him(from Him-ness), it is Tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God's permission as Quran points to it. The border between the Tawhid and Shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God(to Him-ness). Tawhid of the essence Twelvers believe that the first level of Tawhid pertain to the essence of God that is the essence of God is one and peerless. His nature has not any plurality. Ali states that \\"nothing is similar to Him and He is One in meaning.\\" Shia believe that God's names and attributes have no other reality than His essence. Regarding this, Quran 112 states: Say, \\"He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.\\" Contrary to the Tawhid, is Shirk. It is a belief that the world has more than one basis or pole, Motahari states. Tawhid of the attributes According to the Twelver, second level of Tawhid pertains to the oneness of divine attributes, that is His attributes are not separate from His essence. Ali argues that \\"Every attributes testifies to its being other than the object to which it is attributed, and every such object in turn testifies to its being other than the attribute.\\" Tawhid of the attributes means to deny the existence of any sort of multiplicity and combination in the Essence itself. A differentiation between the essence and the attributes or between the attributes implies a limitation in being. His attributes are of two kinds: attributes of perfection and attributes of imperfection. Attributes of perfection have positive nature and give a higher ontological value to the subject. Attributes of imperfection are negative and shows the lack of perfection which Quran states that God never possesses such attributes and all the positive and perfect attributes are directly related to God. As God is an absolute reality without any limitation, so his perfect attributes are limitless and infinite, too. While possessing all the positive attributes, he is beyond all the attributes. Tawhid of creatorship The third level of Tawhid pertains to the oneness of the source of creatorship, that is there is no creator but God, that is the causes and effects of the universe are not independent from God just as the beings which are not independent in essence. There is no power except by God, according to Motahari. He adds, to account some created things as partners of God in creation is the Shirk of Creatorship or to believe that some creatures are the agent of some actions. Just as the creatures are dependent in essence, they are dependent of influence, too. But to believe in a supernatural being who is dependent on God and is the transmitter of God's mercy to human is not Shirk. Tawhid of lordship The fourth level of Tawhid pertains to the oneness of lordship and of the governance of the world and man. This oneness of lordship has two aspects: creative governance (tadbir takwini), and religious governance (tadbir tashrii). At last oneness in worship, that is God alone is to be worshipped. Tawhid or Monotheism is the belief in one God or in God's Essential Oneness. Motahari states that this level of Tawhid refers to the practice, being and becoming, i.e. bringing man into unity, the other levels of Tawhid are \\"seeing\\" but this level of Tawhid is \\"going\\". According to Islam, every choice of an orientation, ideal or a spiritual qibla is a kind of worship. He adds that Tawhid in practice is the individual's growing unified through worship of God alone by means of rejecting all kinds of counterfeit worship (such as worship of carnal desires, money or prestige) and in society's growing unified through worship of God alone by means of rejecting discrimination and injustice. So attaining to happiness is through attaining unity and attaining unity is through worshiping the Truth. He further adds that to worship other than God is Shirk of Lordship, it is a kind of practice,too. Shirk in practice has levels, some of them are evident and some are very hidden which Muhammad points to it in a hadith [The progress of] shirk is more hidden than the passage of an ant over a stone on a dark night.\\" The least of this kind of shirk is the love of injustice and the hate of justice, is religion anything other than loving and hating for God. According to the Quran, every act of obedience to an order is worshiping. =Adalah (justice)= The Shias believe that there is intrinsic good or evil in things, and that God (: see God in Islam) commands them to do the good things and forbade the evil. They believe that God acts according to a purpose or design, and human reason cannot comprehend this design or purpose in its entirety (though man must always strive to understand as much as he can). =Nubuwwah (prophethood)= Nubuwwah, or \\"prophethood\\", denotes that God has appointed Prophets and Messengers to teach mankind God's message. God has appointed prophets and messengers to teach mankind the religion (that is, a perfect system of how to live in \\"peace\\" or \\"submission to God\\"). Prophets are Messengers which are appointed by Allah to bring the message of God to people and spread that message while the Imam (leader) is appointed by Allah to protect that message since ordinary people will fail to do so. Also, as Muhammad was the last messenger of God which means the message he brought was the last and final message to the people from Allah, none is supposed to bring a message from Allah after Muhammad, therefore, if people were left with the message alone, the true message could not survive long and would have undergone changes. Imams were therefore appointed to take care of the message and prevent people from going astray after the last prophet. =Imamah (leadership)= Imamah (\\"leadership\\"): God has appointed specific leaders to lead and guide mankind‚Äîa prophet appoints a custodian of the religion before his demise. According to the Hadith of the Twelve Successors, Muhammad said that the Islamic leadership is in Quraysh (i.e. his tribe) and that or \\"caliphs\\") shall succeed him. Twelver Shias believe in twelve imams. They believe eleven of the imams were killed but that the twelfth imam is still alive. It is stated that he disappeared after performing funeral rites of the eleventh imam (his father), that he is still in ghaybah (occultation) and that he will come out of the occultation one day to bring an end to tyranny and oppression. =Yawm al-Qiyamah (The Day of Resurrection)= Yawm al-Qiyamah ( (Qur'an 71:18), also known as \\"the Hour\\" (Qur'an 31:34, 74:47), \\"Day of the Account\\" (Qur'an 72:130), \\"Day of the Gathering\\", \\"Day of the Reckoning\\", \\"Day of Distress\\" (Qur'an 74:9), and the \\"Great Announcement\\") is the Arabic name for the Last Judgement. Belief in Qiyamah is part of Aqidah and is a fundamental tenet of faith in Islam. After the annihilation of this world, God will raise mankind for Judgement. The trials and tribulations of Qiyamah are detailed in both the Qur'an and the Hadith, as well as in the commentaries of the Islamic expositors and scholarly authorities. Every human, Muslim and non- Muslim alike, is held accountable for his or her deeds and are judged by God accordingly (Qur'an 74:38). =Other articles= Mala'ika‚ÄîBelief in the Angels.

Biography Te√≥filo Braga was born in the Azores, in S√£o Jos√©, Ponta Delgada, the son of Joaquim Manuel Fernandes Braga (probably a grandson of one of King D. Jo√£o V's illegitimate children), from Braga, and Maria Jos√© da C√¢mara e Albuquerque, from the island of Santa Maria, another descendant of Portuguese nobility (probably traced to Infanta D. Urraca, as the genealogist Ferreira Serpa has shown). Te√≥filo was the 13th descendant of Diogo Gon√ßalves Travassos, father of D. Pedro and de Violente Velho Cabral, daughter of the Commander of Almourol, Gon√ßalo Velho, and descendant of Cristov√£o Falc√£o, a poet and Count of Avranches. His mother had seven children (Te√≥filo being the youngest), of which three died during infancy, the others being Lu√≠s, Jo√£o Fernandes and Maria Jos√©.L√∫cia Costa Melo Simas, 2007 Te√≥filo's father became a widower when Te√≥filo was only three years old (his mother died at the age of 31 years). Originally, his father was an artillery lieutenant and commander in Mosteiros, and quit the army after the Concession of Evoramonte, and without means, he established a nautical school and mathematics in Ponta Delgada, eventually finding a job at the local secondary school in Ponta Delgada. Two years later, the older Braga wed a woman (Ricarda Joaquina Marfim Pereira) with a decidedly bad attitude to the young boy,Of his stepmother, Te√≥filo would recount that his worst experiences of instances when he was kicked by the stepmother for showing her affections, and of a situation where he would take revenge by tying her boot-strings together. Simas (2007) also referred to instances when T√©ofilo would cry passionately at the grave of his departed mother, promising to be successful and never to succumb to despair. fathering two daughters with Ricarda (Maria da Gl√≥ria and Maria do Esp√≠rito Santo). The child took refuge in literature, and specifically in the public library in Ponta Delgada or at the home of the Viscount of Praia, where his father (for a time) was a private tutor to the Viscount's daughters.It is likely that at this time he became friends with the Viscount; later when he was attaining the chair of Modern Literature Te√≥filo would count on the Viscount as a benefactor. Simas, 2007 It was in the Ribeira Grande newspaper A Estrela Oriental (The Oriental Star), edited by former- pharmacist Francisco Maria Supico (a native of Lous√£), that his first naive poem A Can√ß√£o do Guerreiro (\\"A Song of the Warrior\\"), in a patriotic tone, dedicated to his brother Jo√£o Fernandes Braga was published. He followed these with O Meteoro and O Santelmo. At the age of 15 in 1859, in an edition paid for by the Viscount of Praia, he published a book of verses entitled Folhas Verdes (\\"Green Leaves\\") and edited by the newspaper A Ilha (The Island); it was a timid imitation of Folhas Ca√≠das (Fallen Leaves) by noted author Almeida Garrett. He revealed a tenacity and combative nature and was known to have been disciplined during his time at his secondary school in Ponta Delgada (where his father was teacher) for disparaging remarks made to his teacher. At the end of secondary school Te√≥filo hoped for future prospects, even informing his father of his intention to leave S√£o Miguel and travel to America for a professional career (likely as a typographer or merchant).Amadeu Carvalho Homem, 1989 But his father suggested expanding his studies at the University of Coimbra, mindful of his child's lack of abilities in his preferred fields. Therefore, Te√≥filo Braga, student, arrived in Coimbra in April 1861, with hopes of achieving a doctorate in Theology or Law; after a year, in which he repeated his prerequisite entrance qualifications, he joined the Faculty of Law at the University. His first lodging would be at the home of Filipe de Quental (1824‚Äì1892), professor of Medicine and paternal uncle of the author Antero de Quental. =University= Life as a student was spartan and austere, and he did not adopt the Bohemian lifestyle on campus, preferring to concentrate on his studies. A contemporary, the writer Ramalho Ortig√£o, had this to say of the young Te√≥filo: :\\"Simple, sober, hard, with habits of austerity bordering on spartan, he knows how to reduce his requirements as he lacks resources, living in his isolation like Robinson on his island, Te√≥filo Braga has a unique passion, a passion of a prelate of science. He does not publish a volume per week because there is no machine in Portugal that can accompany the rapidness of his pen. He writes with grace, disinterested, in the satisfaction of his supreme pleasure, pleasure of spilling ideas. This incredible force and at the same time his unique weakness; I've never met another. At his most acerbic nature, he has a passion of his ideas...in the 19th century, with his systematic activity and with his impatience guided by the profoundly pacifist philosophy of Augusto Comte, Te√≥filo Braga is the most perfect archetype of the uncredited worker and useful citizen. In the middle of Portuguese society...[we are] consoled by the power of contemplation, and a figure such as Te√≥filo Braga is a rare curiosity that we call...a human\\"Manuel Amaral, 1915, pp. 437‚Äì438 While at Coimbra he became involved with the literary agitation; Te√≥filo joined his contemporaries, which included the writer Antero de Quental, in what became known as Quest√£o Coimbra (English: Question Coimba), a loose affiliation of artists with non-traditionalist philosophies and ideals about 1865. He remained on the periphery of this group's activities, though, while writing many of his recognized early works: O Pirilampo, O F√≥sforo and Tira-Teimas. A few of his professors in the Faculty of Law recognized his application, and arranged tasks that helped his studies, including the organization and classification of monastic documents. But his new projects did not affect his participation with the student activists against the autocratic Rector Bas√≠lio Alberto de Sousa Pinto and many of the traditionalists at Coimbra. He reserved his best efforts for his own projects; during this time he convinced editor Gomes Monteiro, of Casa Mor√© (a publishing house in Oporto), to publish his poem Vis√£o dos Tempos (in 1864). It was a work that borrowed directly for its base the themes from Victor Hugo's La L√©gende des si√®cles, and captured in verse all the essential classicism of Judaism and Christianity. The work received many positive reviews. At the time the indisputable authority of Portuguese literature was Ant√≥nio Feliciano de Castilho and his Lisbon admirers, who could establish or ruin the reputation of young authors. Castilho, and his prot√©g√© Manuel Pinheiro Chagas were captivated by the classic prose of Vis√£o (English: Vision) and congratulated in public Bragas' work. But this was not repeated in his follow-up book of poetry Tempestades Sonoras, which were preceded by a philosophical prologue that was both obscure and indecipherable. Generally, Castilho's conservative Lisbon admirers criticized severely many of the personalities with dissident tendencies, due to considerations both artistic and political. At the time of the publication of Tempestades, Antero de Quental had just completed his Odes Modernas (English: Modern Odes), a shockingly militant work that challenged the conservative constitutional monarchy in Portugal, its class society and the religious hierarchy. Castilho and his prelates decided to begin a philosophical battle, without quarter, against the two iconoclasts, \\"that they considered exponents of a School at Coimbra of depraved tastes and highly harmful.\\" The literary \\"conflict\\" began in earnest when Manuel Pinheiro Chagas published his obra-prima Poema da Mocidade. Ant√≥nio Feliciano de Castilho, in a letter-to-the-editor Ant√≥nio Maria Pereira, to promote the book and provide a prologue to the volume, critically attacked Antero Quental and Te√≥filo Braga, as well as their loose affiliation of friends. This was the beginning of the Quest√£o Coimbr√£ Movement, an impassioned period that involved many Portuguese literary writers, that included many critical texts and apologies. Antero de Quental responded with his work which challenged Castilho's original text, which he entitled Bom Senso e Bom Gosto (English: Good Sense and Good Taste), followed by A Dignidade das Letras (English: A Dignity of Letters) and Literaturas Oficiais (English: Official Literature), while Te√≥filo challenged with his literary violent work As Teocracias Liter√°rias (English: The Literary Theocracy). After his first year at the University, won by his tenacious inflexibility and idealism, Braga was confronted by the literary conflicts between traditionalists and modernists: :\\"Quickly, I found myself encircled by hate; they cut-off my life in the newspaper; in Law classes, they took my academic distinctions; the critics devastated me rudely; the bookstore owners refused to publish what I wrote; and the patriarchs of Letters, with their authoritative weight smiles with sober equivalence at my intellectual value, circulating depressive stories about my character and customs, which served to dismake my sacrifices. Another would have given up. I saw myself forced to reverse the base of my existence, abandon the Art that had seduced me, because it removed my contemplative serenity, and I launched myself into criticizing, into erudite knowledge, into science, into philosophy.\\" Rocha Martins referred to an interview that he had with Braga, in 1916, and where, as a visible admirer of the writer and president, he wrote of Te√≥filo's life and difficulties at Coimbra. Te√≥folio had recalled that one time, in Oporto, at the home of the librarian Mor√© he had met Camilo Castelo Branco, who had extended his hand in friendship, but Braga had \\"turned his back\\". As Rocha Martins elaborated, Te√≥filo \\"was just a youth then...today he would not have turned his back on anyone...All men should learn to forgive\\".Maria Lu√≠sa V. de Paiva Bol√©o, 1996 It was not just an attack on aesthetic differences between political ideologies, Castilho also endorsed his prot√©g√© (Chagas) for a professorship in the department of Modern Literature of the Faculty of Letters, and used his letter to champion him for the position, in which both Te√≥filo and his friend Antero Quental were interested. In April 1868 Te√≥filo Braga married Maria do Carmo Xavier (1841‚Äì1911), sister of J√∫lio de Matos, generally from a wealthy family (the couple would live at the Matos home for a time). Their life together would be tragic, marked by the premature deaths of their children: Joaquim, just after his birth (1869), Te√≥filo, at 13 (1886) and in March of the next year, Maria da Gra√ßa, at 16 (1887). Maria do Carmo, whose health was always fragile, was inconsolable (and by the time her husband held the Presidency her health was debilitated and she died away soon afterwards). Camilo Castelo Branco a declared enemy of the writer, would be unusually forgiving, when Te√≥filo's children died within a brief period of one another; at the time, Camilo would write the sonet A maior dor humana\\" (English: The Greatest Human Pain). His political affiliations made it difficult to obtain a professorship at the Academia Polit√©cnica do Porto (English: Polytechnic Academy of Oporto), as well as the Faculty of Law in Coimbra. Te√≥filo Braga had to wait a year, in 1872 (when he obtained his Law degree), in order to succeed in his application to a position as a full professor in Modern Literature, in a memorable public competition. He was the superior choice of the presiding judge of the committee, rather than his rival Manuel Pinheiro Chagas and Luciano Cordeiro, who were endorsed by semi- official patrons. =Positivism and published works= Te√≥filo Braga (1882) Te√≥filo aspired to be a systematic thinker; a theorist based on evidence which permitted an intrepid and dogmatic interpretation of Man, world and life. It was therefore, no surprise, that he accepted the tenets of Positivism. This positivist spirit would guide him between 1872 and 1877, under the influence of Joaquim Duarte Moreira de Sousa a professor of Mathematics in Castelo Branco, with whom he regularly had conversations. It was the teacher's curious spirit and admiration of Auguste Comte and √âmile Littr√© that influenced Te√≥filo during this period. It was these influences that brought him to found, along with J√∫lio de Matos, the magazine O Positivismo in Oporto, between 1878 and 1882, to write Tra√ßos Gerais de Filosofia Positiva (English: General Ideas of Philosophical Positivism), 1877 and later Sistema de Sociologia (English: System of Sociology), 1884. While still professor of Letters and research fellow, Te√≥filo Braga was studious and unrested, yet he continued to give all his attention to his family (showering on them gifts from his poor remuneration). In his home on Travessa de Santa Gertrudes he lived a monastic lifestyle, usually broken by invitations from admirers or civic campaigns. But generally, he was able to concentrate on his writing, including his monumental Hist√≥ria da Literatura Portuguesa (English: History of Portuguese Literature). With a vast repository of documents he would nurture interpretations of medieval romances and produce ultra-romantic works of realism. It was also during this time when he would show interests in ethnography, especially folklore: in 1867, Hist√≥ria da Poesia Popular Portuguesa (English: History of Popular Portuguese Poetry), Cancioneiro Popular (English: Collection of Popular Poems) and Romanceiro Geral, and then later (1869) the book Cantos Populares do Arquip√©lago A√ßoreano' (English: Popular Stories of the Azorean Archipelago). He would repeat this style in 1883 Contos Tradicionais do Povo Portugu√™s' (English: Traditional Stories of the Portuguese People) and in 1885, two volumes entitled O Povo Portugu√™s (English Collection of Portuguese Romances), about costumes and traditions, but his studies were generally criticized during the period. On some occasions he was considered a plagiarist; Braga read profusely and was not too careful while editing his analyses, omitting citations and mentioning unreferenced ideas or the theories of others. The medic and politician Ricardo Jorge, didn't disguise his exasperation in his book Contra um pl√°gio do Prof. The√≥filo Braga (English: Against a Plagiarized Work of Professor Te√≥filo Braga), in 1917: :Te√≥filo Braga, the venerated image of a diverse writer...remember the Indian idols, crowned with many heads...he is multi-headed. Each head, full of knowledge. Like the carrancas of a fountain, there erupts from each mouth a torrent of recorded science. Even Antero de Quental, who was friendly with Te√≥filo, referred to him as a hierophant of literary charlatanism. The Brazilian historian S√≠lvio Romero, called him Papa dos charlat√£es (English: Father of Charlatans). Jos√© Relvas, another contemporary, was another person who dismissed his contributions; he noted that the prestige he gained was not justified, and that only those who didn't read his published works would admire him. In its political aspects, positivism was a version of republicanism that acknowledged the stratification of classes by the capitalist model. Te√≥filo, while reading the works of Comte, fixated on the more radical rationalisms on Philosophical Positivism. On the philosophies of Auguste Comte, defending the ideas of positivism. \\"The positivist consolidated above all the idea that the Republic could not be just a coup d'√©tat, and that maybe, we should dispense with revolutionary intentions.\\"Jos√© Mattoso, Hist√≥ria de Portugal, vol. 6, p. 403 The Republicans believed that \\"to create a Republic required a liberation of individuals of their older ideas...[that] without a doubt, it was [their] spiritual subjugation\\"Mattoso, idem, p. 409 In Portugal of the time, about 50,000 individuals (in a population of less than six million) had declared themselves as non-Catholics. For Republicans, they believed that the population was captive to a Roman Catholic church that (during 1864) had condemned liberalism and all modern ideas.Mattoso, idem, p. 4O9 For the historian Ant√≥nio Reis, Te√≥fflo Braga's doctrinaire style was important in consolidating the Republican cause. His visceral Jacobinismo, allowed him to synthesize the theses of Republican Federalists; the themes of administrative decentralization, imperial mandates and limits which would allow the management of the Portuguese republican model of public education, on the combat of clerical ultramontanism, national sovereignty, and development of democratic ideals that would include universal suffrage. All these ideas would be elaborated in the newspapers A Vanguarda, O S√©culo and O Rebate. The militancy of these works would serve as guides for many republicans of his time. Between 1879 and 1881 he would write many of his more political ideas, including Solu√ß√µes Positivas da Pol√≠tica Portuguesa (English: Positivist Solutions to Portuguese Politics), 1879, Hist√≥ria das Ideias Republicanas em Portugal (English: A History of Republican Ideas in Portugal), 1880, and Dissolu√ß√£o do Sistema Mon√°rquico-Representativo (English: Dissolution of the Monarchical-Representative System), 1881. These propaganda pieces did not mean an end to his other works; in addition to participating in numerous comedies, festivals, clubs and republican associations, he was one of the personalities, in partnership with Ramalho Ortig√£o, to coordinate the fesitivities to mark the third centenary of the death of Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes, the epic Portuguese writer,(10 June 1880). He would later become a partner in the Academia Real das Ci√™ncias (English: Royal Academy of Sciences), Lisbon, and the Academia Real de Hist√≥ria (English: Royal Academy of History), Madrid, where he would be honoured in subsequent years. =Politics= Braga became active in Portuguese politics in 1878, when he campaigned for deputy as an independent federalist republican. Over the years, he had many jobs in the Portuguese Republican Party. He participated in the political barricades during the revolt in Oporto (31 January 1891), added to the list of members of the Republican Party and worked in partnership with Francisco Homem Cristo. The membership of the Republican Party in Lisbon never anticipated the success of the Republican revolt in the north. Te√≥filo and Homen Cristo attempted to win the sympathy of the army, but were largely unsuccessful, due partly to the romantic militaristic ideals of many of the soldiers. After the failure of the conspiracy, with many of those retreating or sent to a military tribunal in Leix√µes, the two criticized Lisbon Republicans for their lack of assistance for the rebels in Oporto. Te√≥filo occupied himself with arguing with the objectors and taking on an important role in the propaganda of the Republican Party. By 1896 he was a member of the Grupo Republicano de Estudos Sociais (English: Republican Social Studies Group). Official portrait of President Te√≥filo Braga by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro The political situation in Portugal had degraded after the 1890 British Ultimatum. Further, between the 19th Century and 20th Century, the system of power that rotated between the parties was slowly dismantled; the divisions introduced by Jo√£o Franco and Jos√© Maria de Alpoim resulted in the creation of splinter groups in addition to the two historical constitutional parties (respectively, the Partido Regenerador Liberal alongside the Partido Regenerador and the Dissid√™ncia Progressista from the Partido Progressista), which would alter the rules of political coexistence. A dictatorship created by Jo√£o Franco after May 1907 (endorsed by King Carlos) was an episode of cumulative crises provoked by Hintze Ribeiro, leader of the Partido Regenerador, and Jos√© Luciano de Castro, responsible for the Partido Progressista. Te√≥filo Braga accompanied many of these events, as well as Francoist Spain, the regicide and enthronement of King D. Manuel II, of which the journalist Jo√£o Chagas wrote: ...[Manuel II assumed the military regalia] when by now it was not needed. The republican cause had grown in importance, helped by the Republican Party, freemasons, the Carbon√°ria Portuguesa and by numerous groups of doctrinarian idealists influenced by the cause. On 1 January 1910, he became an effective member of the Political Directorate of the party, joining Bas√≠lio Teles, Eus√©bio Le√£o, Jos√© Cupertino Ribeiro, and Jos√© Relvas. On 28 August 1910, he was elected deputy for Lisbon. The revolution began on the morning of 4 October 1910 and lasted until the next day. Te√≥filo Braga was acclaimed President of Provisional Government of the Portuguese Republic. But the old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic; factions quickly developed between groups within the party to form new organizations: Afonso Costa's faction would form the Partido Democr√°tico (the most populist, Jacobin and urban party), Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida founded the Partido Evolucionista (a contemporary faction that included the rural bouregoeis) and Brito Camacho created the Uni√£o Republicana (which was an intellectual group with many of its members from Lisbon). The first conflict involved the electoral act: Afonso Costa's \\"democrats\\" wanted Bernardino Machado to be the first President of the Republic, but Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida and Manuel de Brito Camacho factions were able to elect Manuel de Arriaga for that title. Te√≥filo Braga, who was always more closely affiliated with the membership of the \\"Democrats\\" and owing to small problems with Arriaga, endorsed Bernardino Machado. He would return to government in May 1915; he became the President of the Republic after the abrupt resignation of Manuel de Arriaga. Arriaga had supported Pimenta de Castro to run the government, and the General had established a dictatorship, which was eventually defeated. In disgrace the pacifist first President vacated the job, and the assembly elected Braga to the position. =Later life= Braga was an extremely austere man; after becoming a widower, he was a recluse and occupied much of his time in his library. Even as President, he would walk, umbrella or cane in hand, everywhere,Early correspondence would show his love of walking by recounting how he had walked once to the Serra do Bussaco, then to Figueira (to see the sea), and another time to visit his aunts in Braga from Porto. He would start at seven o'clock in the morning and reach Porto by four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day. Simas, 2007 and generally, his Presidency itself was not an exercise in ostentatious living. Over time, as a man-of-letters, Te√≥filo Braga was recognized by historians as an erudite author. His final home, was on the second-floor of 70 Rua de Santa Gertrudes √† Estrela, in Lisbon, and his neighbor usually accompanied him for breakfast or lunch. He wore over-used clothing, many of these clothes he repaired personally, including white linens which were his departed wife's possessions (and reminded him of their earlier life together). He was a solitary figure, and had lost many of his closest relations (his mother died early during his life, his father died in the Azores Islands, he lost his children in their infancies and his beloved wife died before he did), as well as his sight. In his last will, he expressed his desire to be interred in a civil service, without ceremony. He died at 80 years of age, on 28 January 1924, and was buried in the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Bel√©m, Lisbon. Published works As for his literary career, one can find books by Braga concerning the history of literature, on ethnography (mainly his search for popular stories and traditional songs), poetry, fiction, and philosophy. Braga's body of published work is also connected to historical investigation; while balancing philosophy, linguistics and culture he wrote Hist√≥ria da Poesia Popular Portuguesa (English: The History of Popular Portuguese Poetry), Hist√≥ria do Teatro Portugu√™s (English: History of the Portuguese Theatre) and Hist√≥ria das Ideias Republicanas em Portugal (English: The History of Republican Ideals in Portugal). One of his most contentious, from a scientific point-of-view, was Hist√≥ria do Romantismo em Portugal (English: The History of Romanticism in Portugal), in 1880, although his four-volume Hist√≥ria da Universidade de Coimbra (English: History of the University of Coimbra) is still considered important. =Poetry= * Vis√£o dos Tempos (1864) * Tempestades Sonoras (1864) * Torrentes (1869) * Miragens Seculares (1884) * Poesia do Direito (1865) =Fiction= * Contos Fant√°sticos (1865) * Viriato (1904) =Essays= * As Teorias Liter√°rias ‚Äì Relance sobre o Estado Actual da Literatura Portuguesa (1865) * Hist√≥ria da Poesia Moderna em Portugal (1869) * Hist√≥ria da Literatura Portuguese (Introdu√ß√£o) (1870) * Hist√≥ria do Teatro Portugu√™s (1870‚Äì1871) ‚Äì 4 volumes * Teoria da Hist√≥ria da Literatura Portuguesa (1872) * Manual da Hist√≥ria da Literatura Portuguesa (1875) * Bocage, sua Vida e √âpoca (1877) * Parnaso Portugu√™s Moderno (1877) * Tra√ßos gerais da Filosofia Positiva (1877) * Hist√≥ria do Romantismo em Portugal (1880) * Sistema de Sociologia (1884) * Cam√µes e o Sentimento Nacional (1891) * Hist√≥ria da Universidade de Coimbra (1891‚Äì1902) ‚Äì 4 volumes * Hist√≥ria da Literatura Portuguesa (1909‚Äì1918) ‚Äì 4 volumes =Anthologies and research= * Antologias: Cancioneiro Popular (1867) * Contos Tradicionais do Povo Portugu√™s (1883) See also * List of Presidents of Portugal * List of Prime Ministers of Portugal * Portuguese First Republic * History of Portugal * Timeline of Portuguese history * Politics of Portugal * Culture of Portugal Notes References  External links   * Category:1843 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Azorean politicians Category:Azorean writers Category:People from Ponta Delgada Category:Presidents of Portugal Category:Portuguese agnostics Category:Portuguese philosophers Category:Portuguese republicans Category:Portuguese Republican Party politicians Category:Democratic Party (Portugal) politicians Category:University of Coimbra alumni Category:19th-century Portuguese writers Category:19th-century male writers Category:20th-century Portuguese politicians ","title":"Te√≥filo Braga"},{"id":"2623355","text":"Showkat Baksh, also known as Charles Baksh (born 15 March 1938, in Trinidad and Tobago) is a former cricketer, a right-handed batsman who played for the Canadian cricket team.

He also exported fine paintings, antiques, and objet d'art from Italy to Boston during the 1850s, selling most of it through private dealers and at auctions in New York City and Boston. Hewins was born in Sharon, Massachusetts, to Esther (Kollock) and Amasa Hewins. He married Elizabeth Newell Alden on August 22, 1820, and thereafter he lived in Dedham. In 1821, Hewins was listed in the Boston business directory as a merchant in West India goods on Brattle Street in Boston, trading in rum, sugar, molasses and cotton. A year later, Elizabeth gave birth to their first child, Charles, prompting Amasa to take his younger brother Royall into business as a partner; the couple eventually had nine children. An advertisement for A. Hewins, portrait painter appeared in the New York newspaper ‚ÄúThe National Advocate‚Äù on December 6, 1824. In 1825, Hewins relocated his family to Washington City, where he offered an Academy for the instruction of young Ladies and gentlemen and also held a post as Professor of Drawing at Mr. and Mrs. Bonfils Young Ladies‚Äô Seminary, the school of his sister-in-law and her husband, until at least 1827. Returning to Boston around 1828, Hewins first exhibited at the Boston Athenaeum in 1830, and occasionally thereafter until 1846; he also exhibited at the National Academy of Design. From August 1830 to June 1833, he travelled abroad in Italy, France and England, along with American artists Horatio and John Greenough, Samuel F.B. Morse, and Thomas Cole. In 1839, Hewins traveled to Baltimore and then to New Haven, Connecticut, where he took up residence and advertised as a portrait-painter. It was here, during the height of the Amistad Affair, that the 135-foot-long, ‚ÄúThe Magnificent Painting of the Massacre on Board the Schooner Amistad!!‚Äù was conceived of by Hewins. It toured New England in the spring of 1840. The following year Hewins set sail for his second trip to Florence via Gibraltar; he traveled from November 1841 to August 1842. In Florence, he met with friends Horatio Greenough and Hiram Powers and made sketches for his panorama painting: ‚ÄúThe Largest Painting in the world‚Ä¶ Hutching‚Äôs Grand Classical Panorama of the Sea and Shores of the Mediterranean‚Ä¶Executed from drawings made by A. Hewins during his voyages in the Mediterranean, and his travels in Spain, France and Italy.‚Äù From June 1848 to January 1849 the Hutching's Gallery in Boston displayed Hewins's moving panorama at the Masonic Temple-Tremont Street. It traveled over the next two years and was displayed, amongst other locations, in Ohio, Albany and New York City. In March 1852, Hewins returned to Florence, Italy where he painted and worked. In 1854 Hewins was appointed Consular General of Tuscany at Livorno; this position aided him in the exportation of Italian paintings, antiques, and objet d'art to the United States. Dying from Cholera in August 1855, Hewins was buried in the Protestant Cemetery (often called the English Cemetery). His papers are collected in the Boston Athenaeum.

He was born at Valencia about the middle of the 16th century, joined the army, fought at Lepanto, and retired to his birthplace with the rank of captain shortly before 1586. The work for which he is best known is El Monserrate (1587), an epic about the legendary founding of the monastery at Monserrate. The poem was well received in its time and had the honor of being praised by Miguel de Cervantes, and of being reprinted in 1601. Shortly afterwards Viru√©s returned to Italy and issued a recast of his poem entitled El Monserrate segundo (1602). By the twentieth century both epics and pious works began to fall from critical favor and since that time the work has been largely forgotten. His Obras tr√°gicas y l√≠ricas (1609) include five tragedies: La Gran Sem√≠ramis, La Cruel Casandra, Atila furioso, La Infelice Marcela and Elisa Dido. The date of his death is unknown, but he is conjectured to have been alive as late as 1614. Viru√©s belongs to the school of dramatists displaced by Lope de Vega, and his methods were out of fashion before his plays were printed; yet he is an interesting figure, chiefly because of the very extravagances which destroy the effect of his best scenes.

After working as a meteorologist during World War I, Zinner returned to Bamberg, but then moved to Munich to work in geodesy. In 1924 Zinner received the professor's title from the University of Munich. He was appointed director of Remeis-Observatory in Bamberg, Germany, in 1926 and retired in 1956. During this time his main astronomical work centered on stellar astronomy. His main speciality and interest, however, was Renaissance Astronomy and the history of astronomical instruments, an area in which he started working in 1925.

The station broadcasts at 93.7 MHz with 100 kW and is licensed to New Iberia, Louisiana. KYFJ is currently under ownership of Bible Broadcasting Network. It was previously held by The Last Bastion Station Trust, LLC, who picked up this station after its previous owner Citadel Broadcasting swapped the station for KNEK-FM. The station's transmitter is located in the Atchafalaya Basin area in rural St. Martin Parish. History =Z-Rock, 1992= KRDJ signed on in June 1992 as KKZN, an affiliate of the Z-Rock satellite network. KKZN was a Cavaness Broadcasting station, co-owned with what was then KVOL and KVOL-FM as the first FM duopoly in the Lafayette market; Z-Rock 93.7 was effectively the replacement of the rock format previously heard on KVOL-FM before that station flipped to Urban AC in July 1992. At the time, KKZN was broadcasting with 34 kilowatts from a tower located off Highway 90 in southern Iberia Parish between the towns of Jeanerette and Glencoe. =Adult contemporary, 1992‚Äì1997= The rock format lasted only until November, when KKZN became KDEA, picking up the calls dropped in favor of KXKC by another New Iberia station earlier in the year. KDEA switched to hot adult contemporary as KD93.7 shortly afterward. =Urban/urban AC, 1997‚Äì1998= In 1997, Cavaness Broadcasting sold KDEA, along with KVOL and KVOL-FM, to Baton Rouge-based Powell Broadcasting, who also owned KSMB. Also around that time, they applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to upgrade from 34 kilowatts to a full 100 kilowatts and relocate to a tower south of Maringouin, allowing the station to serve both the Lafayette and Baton Rouge radio markets. To prepare for the upgrade, the formats of KDEA and KVOL-FM were swapped in late January, with KVOL-FM becoming adult contemporary as \\"Star 105.9\\" and KDEA picking up the urban AC format. Once the signal upgrade was completed in February, KDEA's shifted its focus exclusively toward the Baton Rouge market and shifted to mainstream urban as \\"93-7 the Beat\\" KTBT, eventually shifting back to urban AC as \\"93-7 Jamz.\\" =Oldies, 1998‚Äì2002= In October 1998, KTBT was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, who had recently purchased a group of Baton Rouge stations that included a more popular urban AC station. Shortly after the sale was completed, KTBT's urban AC format was abruptly ended and the station began stunting with Christmas music. The stunt lasted for three weeks before Citadel launched \\"Oldies 93.7\\" KOOJ with a '50s‚Äì'70s oldies format. =Rock/active rock, 2002‚Äì2005= The oldies format lasted until KOOJ began airing a loop of \\"Hair of the Dog\\" by Nazareth and \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" by the Scorpions on October 7, 2002‚Äîtwo days after much of the station's coverage area was hit by Hurricane Lili. On October 11, KOOJ launched a mainstream rock format as \\"Rock 93-7, Real Rock for Baton Rouge.\\" The mainstream rock format was tweaked in 2004 to a more modern active rock presentation and the Lex & Terry morning show was added. =Variety hits, 2005‚Äì2007= The active rock format came to an end at 5:00PM on April 28, 2005, when, after playing \\"Click Click Boom\\" by Saliva, KOOJ flipped to variety hits as \\"Red @ 93.7\\" under new callsign KRDJ. The first song on Red was \\"Start Me Up\\" by The Rolling Stones. The name was likely inspired by Baton Rouge being French for \\"red stick\\" (the liners even promoted the station as \\"broadcasting from our 5,000 foot big red stick in downtown Baton Rouge\\".) =Classic rock/active rock, 2007‚Äì2014= On February 1, 2007, KRDJ moved its focus back to the Lafayette market and changed format to classic rock, recycling the \\"Rock 93.7\\" moniker and logo previously used by the station. Rock 93.7 launched with Opie and Anthony in the morning, but the show was dropped in October 2008 when the station shifted to its active rock format. Nick and Drew then held morning duties before moving to their assigned slot at night. Jace Edwards was brought in as Program Director and Morning Host. With his arrival, Rock 93.7 became more active in the community benefiting many organizations like Toys for Tots with the United States Marine Corps Reserves and Acadiana Outreach. =Future: Rock is over, BBN takes over= On June 6, 2014, RadioInsight reported that Last Bastion Trust sold KRDJ to Bible Broadcasting Network for $1,775,000. BBN will use 93.7 as a repeater for WYFQ in Charlotte, NC. The station ended its former format at 12:15 pm on August 1. On the last night of Rock 93.7, KRDJ played requests from the DJs of Rock 93.7. Morning DJ Jace Edwards and middayer Rach moved to similarly-formatted KKGB, with the rest of the self-proclaimed \\"Rock Krewe\\" to reveal their new positions in the near future. They held a contest to text in the first word in the last song on Rock 93.7 (which was Losing My Religion by R.E.M.) and 937 to 63582 with the first person to text in (who was Monic Boulette of New Iberia) winning \\"everything that's left\\" of the station. Following that, 93.7 signed off. The station would remain off the air until repairs to the studio were finished in the Fall. The former staff on the station's Facebook page has flipped its logo upside down, also signifying the end of its format. The Facebook page was still online days after and posted on a regular basis, claiming \\"the rock doesn't stop when we're gone.\\" As of late August, the link to the station's Facebook URL redirects to Facebook's newsfeed.Rock93.7fm Fan Page (accessed August 1, 2014) On August 1, 2014 KRDJ changed its call sign to KYFJ.

During his rule there were two attempts to carry out a revolution. The first one, in Santar√©m, in December 1918, was led by the republicans Francisco da Cunha Leal and √Ålvaro Xavier de Castro. The second one was monarchist and was perpetrated in January 1919 and organized by Paiva Couceiro, who for some time managed to control the northern part of the country in what was called the Monarchy of the North. Although Canto e Castro was a monarchist, as President of the Republic he had to fight against a movement that defended his own ideals.

In 2007, a special committee composed of physicians of the Division of Health Inspections of the Prefecture of Piraeus and Piraeus Medical Association has reported that the hospital and the mental clinic of the prison operate without even the minimum conditions of hygiene, with aging infrastructure and big shortages in medical and nursing staff.

Born and reared in Portland, Maine, Gurney moved to Florida after his service in World War II. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1962, Gurney was the second Republican elected to Congress from Florida in the 20th century. In 1968 Gurney was elected as the first Republican Senator from Florida since Reconstruction. Following his indictment in an influence peddling scandal, he resigned December 31, 1974. Eventually he was acquitted of all charges. After being defeated in a run for Congress in 1978, Gurney retired from politics and resumed his law practice. Early life, education and military service Gurney was born in Portland, Maine in 1914. He attended public schools and graduated in 1935 from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. He graduated in 1938 from Harvard Law School. He was admitted to the Bar of New York the following year and began practicing law in New York City. After the United States entered World War II, Gurney enlisted as a private in the United States Army. He was commissioned as an officer and saw action in the European Theatre of conflict. By the time of his discharge in 1946, he had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. After his return to civilian life, Gurney entered Duke Law School, earning a degree in 1948. Career Gurney started his work life after Duke by moving to Winter Park in Orange County in central Florida. He set up a law practice, partnering with Lou Frey, who later succeeded him in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1952, Gurney was elected city commissioner of Winter Park. He served until his election as city attorney for Maitland. He completed his career in local office with service as mayor of Winter Park from 1961 to 1962. House and Senate service Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. campaign with Ronald Reagan in 1968 In 1962, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, the second Republican elected from Florida in the 20th century. He was re-elected in 1964 and 1966. Gurney has been credited with modernizing Florida politics, using \\"sophisticated advertising and other media tools for his statewide campaigns.\\" In 1968, Gurney was elected to the United States Senate for the seat of retiring Democrat George Smathers. The election coincided with Richard Nixon's victory in the presidential race that year, and Gurney was among the candidates who benefited by Nixon's political \\"coattails\\". The national Republican campaign conducted a Southern Strategy, trying to appeal to conservative white voters. Gurney defeated his opponent, former governor Leroy Collins, with 55.9 percent of the vote to Collins' 44.1 percent. Many supporters of third-party presidential candidate George C. Wallace, also voted for Gurney. They were part of a coalition of an increasing number of Republicans in Florida allied with a declining number of conservative white Democrats. Gurney ran on a record that included votes against civil rights legislation (major bills were passed by Congress in 1964 and 1965 to protect constitutional rights of minorities and enforce their ability to vote), foreign aid, and what he called that \\"expensive boondoggle,\\" President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty. Despite such conservative criticism of the federal government, Florida has been one of the states that are net beneficiaries of such federal programs, gaining more in federal funding than its residents pay in taxes.Dean Lacey, \\"Blame FDR and LBJ for 'Moocher' Paradox in Red States\\", Bloomberg View, 19 September 2012, accessed 11 February 2015 In 1973, Gurney was named to the Senate select committee which investigated the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration (otherwise known as the Senate Watergate Committee); it was led by Democratic Senator Sam J. Ervin of North Carolina. Gurney was the administration's strongest supporter on the panel, in contrast to the ranking Republican member, Howard Baker of Tennessee. Dispute with Bill Cramer Gurney competed in the Republican Party with Bill Cramer, a senior leader in Florida who in 1954 had been the first of his party elected to Congress from the state in the 20th century. They were prospective primary opponents for a vacant Senate seat in 1968 until Cramer yielded to Gurney. He believed that Gurney would support him for the other Senate seat, which Spessard Holland was expected to vacate in 1970.Billy Hathorn, \\"Cramer v. Kirk: the Florida Republican Schism of 1970,\\" Florida Historical Quarterly (April 1990), p. 410 Cramer's former law partner Herman Goldner had been mayor of St. Petersburg for one term and was a Moderate Republican. He ran in the primary against Gurney in 1968 but, underfunded and distrusted by many conservative Republican voters, Goldner received few votes. Gurney handily won the Senate seat, carrying all but four counties in the race against Democrat LeRoy Collins, a former governor. Gurney and Cramer traveled in the state in various party-building ventures. In the fall of 1969, Cramer declared his candidacy for the Senate, urged by President Richard M. Nixon to do so. Spessard Holland soon announced his expected retirement. Cramer expected Gurney's support. But in 1970, Gurney and Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. opposed Cramer's nomination; they supported an intraparty rival, George Harrold Carswell. He had been nominated that year to the Supreme Court and was rejected by the Senate, with critical comments about his \\"mediocrity and past \\"racism.\\"The New York Times, April 9, 26, and July 15, 1970 Carswell stepped down from his seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans in order to run for the Senate race. Cramer easily defeated Carswell in the primary for the Republican nomination, but relations within the party became bitter. Gurney did not agree that he and Cramer had a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" about the Senate seat.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 411 That fall, Cramer lost to the Democratic senatorial nominee, State Senator Lawton Chiles of Lakeland. The Democrats also took the governorship in Florida, and that year they were generally victorious over Republican candidates in a sweep across the South. After the election, in his remaining months in office Governor Kirk selected Gurney's Orlando law firm as the counsel for the Florida Turnpike Authority, at a $100,000 annual retainer. Cramer's law firm received no state business.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 414 Indictments In 1974 Gurney was indicted in an influence peddling scandal. Federal prosecutors indicted Gurney and several political aides for collecting payoffs from Florida builders in return for federal housing contracts. On March 19, 1974, William F. Pelski, director of the F.H.A. insuring office in Coral Gables, FL, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Government by making loan commitments to contributors to Gurney, Pelski was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.https://www.nytimes.com, Ex F.H.A. Aide Gets 18 Months for Fraud in Gurney Fund Case, MARCH 20, 1974, Gurney resigned his seat December 31, 1974 and was tried on seven counts of bribery and related offenses. He was acquitted on five counts and the jury could not reach a verdict on two others. In a second trial on those two counts, he was acquitted. Though acquitted, his standing was damaged by the trials and he did not seek re-election. Jack Eckerd, the drugstore magnate, won the Republican primary, but was defeated in the general election by the Democrat Richard Stone. Later years In 1978, Gurney ran again for a seat in the House of Representatives, but was defeated by Democrat Bill Nelson. Gurney retired from politics and resumed the practice of law in Winter Park. Personal Gurney married Natalie, whom he met while in law school. They had three children together, a son and two daughters: Edward, Jill, and Sarah. Edward Gurney III committed suicide in 1968. Natalie Gurney suffered a stroke in 1971 and was bedridden for years before her death in 1978. Gurney married again, to Leeds Dye of Winter Park. She and his two daughters survived his death, in Winter Park, in 1996.Tom Leithauser, \\"Ex- senator Ed Gurney Dies\\", Orlando Sentinel, 22 May 1996, 11 February 2016 Honors and awards *On November 2, 1968, Gurney was initiated as an Honorary brother of Alpha Phi chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi at the University of Florida.Alpha Phi Chapter roll References External links * Biographical Directory of the US Congress Category:1914 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Florida Republicans Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Duke University School of Law alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Colby College alumni Category:Florida lawyers Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Politicians from Portland, Maine Category:People from Winter Park, Florida Category:American Congregationalists Category:American prosecutors Category:United States Army colonels Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Florida Category:United States senators from Florida Category:Mayors of places in Florida Category:Republican Party United States senators Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th- century American lawyers Category:Watergate scandal investigators Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People from Maitland, Florida Category:Candidates in the 1978 United States elections ","title":"Edward Gurney"},{"id":"2623514","text":"This is a list of notable Bangladeshi Americans, including both original immigrants who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants.

Distinguishing features The pickerel frog is a medium sized gray or tan frog marked with seven to twenty-one irregular rectangular dark brown spots which are oriented in two columns down its back.Who is the Pickerel Frog. http://people.wcsu.edu/ The distinctive rectangular spots of the pickerel frog may blend together to form a long rectangle along the back. All leopard frogs have circular spots. In addition, pickerel frogs have prominent dorsolateral ridges that are unbroken. Another important distinguishing mark is the orange or yellow flash pattern found on the inner surface of the hind legs of pickerel frogs. The frog must be picked up to examine this, as the legs cover the coloration otherwise. The plains leopard frog (Lithobates blairi) exhibits this coloration as well, but the dorsolateral ridges are interrupted and inset medially in that species. The front toes of pickerel frogs are not webbed, a morphological characteristic for some frogs of the genus Rana and some frogs of the genus Lithobates. This allows pickerel frogs to be fit for terrestrial life. =Sexual dimorphism= Pickerel frogs display sexual dimorphism; the females are typically larger and darker in color than the males.Mairs, D.F. (1999). \\"Pickerel Frog\\". pp. 98-100. In: Hunter, M.L., A.J.K. Calhoun, and M. McCollough, editors. Maine Amphibians and Reptiles. The University of Maine Press. Orono, Maine. During the summer and breeding season males can be recognized by their swollen thumbs. Males also have internal vocal sacs located between the tympanum and the foreleg. In general, secondary sexual characteristic are not typically evident outside of the breeding season; therefore, pickerel frogs can be rather difficult to sex.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright. (1949). Handbook of Frogs and Toads of the United States and Canada. Comstock Publishing Company, Inc. Ithaca, New York. Range The pickerel frog ranges in the west from much of Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, eastern Iowa, through Missouri and down to eastern Texas. To the east they extend through northern Louisiana, most of Mississippi, northern Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina to the coast. Their northern range extends into Canada in the southern reaches of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The range is spotty through the midwestern states and a field guide should be obtained for the specifics on ranges in a particular area. Habitat Pickerel frogs have varied habitats, the northern specimen prefers to live near cold, clear water. They prefer rocky ravines, bogs and meadow streams, but can be found around lakes and rivers that are heavily wooded. The southern specimen prefer warmer waters, like those of the Coastal Plain and floodplain swamps. They are seen most often along the edges of streams, lakes, rivers, and even flooded ditches. During the winter months they will hibernate under the silt and debris in their aquatic environments; they are usually only active from April to October.Zweifel, Richard G. (editor). (1971). Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles. 1971. Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. 117.1. This catalogue is an excellent source, containing the detailed taxonomy of Rana palustris as well as an extensive bibliography. =Breeding habitat= Pickerel frogs prefer cool clear water. They breed in both temporary ponds and permanent ponds but appear to favor ponds with long to permanent hydroperiods. In Rhode Island specifically, pickerel frog tadpoles and eggmasses were found in permanent manmade rural ponds, farm ponds, and urban ponds surrounded by roads; all of the mentioned habitats were well-vegetated.Paton, P.W.C., and S. Egan. (2001). Effects of Roads on Amphibian Community Structure at Breeding Ponds in Rhode Island. Unpublished Final Report to the Transportation Environmental Research PROGRAM (TERP) Federal Highway Administration. Reproduction Pickerel frogs typically emerge from hibernation around mid April with the majority of the frogs arriving at breeding ponds by early May. At the ponds, pickerel frogs are usually observed in large groups in the water.Green, N.B., and T.K. Pauley. (1987). Amphibians and Reptiles in West Virginia. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Mating behavior is not much different from other ranids. The males initiate breeding by emitting their low pitched call; this call is usually so low pitched that it is often not heard during calling surveys.Paton, P.W.C., and W.B. Crouch III. In press. Using Phenology of Pond- Breeding Amphibians to Develop Conservation Strategies. Conservation Biology. Males are known to call while submerged. Frogs reproduce using a method called Amplexus, a type of external fertilization; sometimes it will last more than a day or two, even after the female has deposited the eggs. =Egg mass= Egg masses are typically laid in well-vegetated areas and are often difficult to locate. The masses superficially resemble those of wood frogs but at close inspection one can usually distinguish between the two. Pickerel frog egg masses are spherical and about the same size of a wood frog egg mass roughly 5‚Äì10 cm in diameter; however, pickerel frog egg masses contain more eggs, about 2000-3000 eggs. Pickerel frog eggs are multicolored, they are dark brown on top and cream colored on the bottom. The egg masses adhere to woody or herbaceous vegetation, varying in depth from a few centimeters below the surface to 4 feet deep. Like most amphibious eggs development is temperature dependent, but pickerel frog eggs usually hatch in 11‚Äì21 days.Degraaf, R.M., and D.D. Rudis. (1983). Amphibians and Reptiles of New England, Habitats and Natural History. University of Massachusetts Press. Amherst, Massachusetts. =Larvae= The tadpole stage lasts roughly 3 months. Small pickerel tadpoles are yellowish to yellowish brown in color; as they grow their color changes to an olive green, which eventually changes to gray brown on top and cream colored underneath. Larger tadpole are often mistaken as green frogs. There are a few characteristics to aid in distinguishing between pickerel and green tadpoles. The nose of the pickerel frog tadpole is more pointed, the eyes are closer together, and the nostrils are closer to the edge of the nose.Dickerson, M.C. (1906). The Frog Book, North American Toads and Frogs with a Study of the Habits and Life Histories of those of the Northeastern States. Doubleday, Page and Company. New York. =Metamorphs= This is the stage where frogs have all four limbs and are able to walk on land, but still have their tails. They are not quite juvenile frogs. Metamorphs are roughly 2.6 cm long, but they are nearly as agile as the adult and juvenile when they emerge from the ponds. They are often mistaken for the closely related leopard frog. Diet The pickerel frog's diet consists of ants, spiders, various bugs, beetles, sawfly larvae, and other invertebrates. In order to catch their prey pickerel frogs will often search grassy areas next to bodies of water. Defense mechanism In case of attack, pickerel frogs have an excellent defense mechanism: they emit skin secretions which are irritating to people and toxic to some predators; making the pickerel frog the only poisonous frog native to the United States.Conant, Roger, and Joseph T. Collins. (1991). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston. pp. 130-134. This guide discusses identification, distribution, lifestyle and ecology, and the conservation status of Rana palustris. Due to its poison, most mammals, birds, snakes and other frogs will leave the pickerel frog alone. The skin secretions of a stressed pickerel frog are known to be toxic to other frogs, as many a novice frog catcher has found when he finds only the pickerel frog still alive in his bucket. These secretions can also be moderately irritating if they come in contact with the eyes, mucous membranes, or broken skin. =Predators= The pickerel frog's poisonous secretions cannot stop all creatures; green frogs, bull frogs, northern water snakes, eastern ribbon snakes, and common garter snakes are their usual predators.Pickerel Frog. When threatened, pickerel frogs will jump into the water and dive to the bottom to escape predators like birds and snakes. References Further reading * Arnold, K. (2000).

Originally referred to as \\"The Portland Six\\", Patrice Lumumba Ford, Jeffrey Leon Battle, October Martinique Lewis (Battle's ex-wife), Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal, and Habis Abdulla al Saoub made up the original six members arrested in October 2002.

The members of the Portland Seven \\"were all named in the 15-count superseding indictment that included charges of conspiracy to levy war against the United States, conspiracy to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda, conspiracy to contribute services to al Qaeda and the Taliban, conspiracy to possess and discharge firearms in furtherance of crimes of violence, possessing firearms in furtherance of crimes of violence and money laundering.\\" OCTOBER MARTINIQUE LEWIS PLEADS GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES IN ‚ÄòPORTLAND CELL‚Äô CASE, DOJ Press Release, September 26, 2003 Background On September 29, 2001, Battle, Ford and al Saoub were discovered while engaged in shooting practice in a gravel pit in Skamania County, Washington, near Washougal. Also present was Ali Khalid Steitiye, who did not become an indicted member of the Portland Seven on terrorism charges but was separately charged with other crimes. The group was discovered by Deputy Sheriff Mark Mercer, who was acting on a tip from a neighbor who had heard gunfire in the pit. Deputy Mercer let the men go after taking their names and reported the incident to the FBI. Battle was taped in a secretly- recorded conversation indicating that they had considered killing Deputy Mercer when confronted: \\"We was up there blowin it up.... We was lightin' it up... [W]e looked at it as worship because what our intentions were, to learn to shoot for. And a cop came up and he was like hey... you don't understand how close he was gonna get popped... yeah, we was gonna pop him.\\" Battle later indicated they had opted not to kill the officer because he seemed \\"cool.\\" Terrorist Blamed His Failure on Bush , Human Events Online, by Terence P.

On October 20, 2001, Ford and the two Bilals also took the same route out of the United States. Between October 2001 and January 2002, Lewis wired a series of money orders to Battle in China and Bangladesh, and in November 2001 and January 2002, Ford wired money to al Saoub in China. Ford returned to the US on or about November 19, 2001. M. Bilal returned to the U.S on or about December 24, 2001. In January 2002,Battle was administratively discharged from the military. Battle also returned to the US on or about February 5, 2002. The six male members of the group traveled to China in early 2002, with the intent of entering Afghanistan to aid the Taliban. Lacking visas and other documentation, they were turned back, and all but al Saoub then returned again to the United States. On Thursday, October 3, 2002, a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the District of Oregon, at Portland, Oregon, indicted Battle, Ford, the two Bilals, al Saoub and Lewis. On October 4, 2002, and the FBI in Portland, Oregon, announced the arrest of four of those original six on charges of aiding and, in some cases, trying to join al-Qaeda fighters. Battle, Ford, and Lewis were all arrested that morning in Portland. Muhammad Bilal was arrested at the same time by the FBI in Dearborn, Michigan. The remaining two, Ahmed Bilal and al Saoub, were both considered fugitives. Steitiye was also named by the FBI as an unindicted co-conspirator.FBI‚ÄôS Joint Terrorism Task Force Arrests Four on Terrorism Charges, Two Others Who Were Indicted Are Now Fugitives, FBI Press Release, Portland Field Office, Google Cache, October 4, 2002 Ali Khalid Steitiye was convicted in 2002 on firearms, fraud, and immigration charges and testified against the others in 2004, as part of a plea agreement in a weapons- possession charge.

Restoration Antiques restoration, National Museum, Warsaw Antique Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after- photo by Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration. Restoration can be as simple as light cleaning to remove disfiguring dirt or grime, such as on the surface of a painting, or it may include near complete rebuilding or replacement, as might be the case with old automobiles or furniture. Often done in preparation for sale, or by a collector upon acquiring a new piece, the main goal of restoration is to \\"restore\\" the original appearance or functionality of a piece. There is a lot of difference between restoring and repairing. Functionality may be achieved by a repair, but restoring an item properly is an art-form. Finishes might/may be stripped and redone, but it is essential that the original patination is retained, if possible. Stripping is only done as a last resort, especially with antique furniture. Engines might be rebuilt with new parts as necessary, or holes in a silver pot might/may be patched. While some of these practices are frowned on by many museums, scholars, and other experts, for many people there is little value in an antique that is unusable or not able to be displayed. Poor restoration is the bane of a trained restorer. Working on someone else's bad repair is the worst possible situation. Often with antique restoration, there are also other issues as well. For example, some collectors value \\"patina\\", or also want an item to still reflect an aesthetic that shows its age- in this respect, an \\"over restored\\" item can actually take away from its value than if nothing has been done to the item at all. Therefore, restoration of valuable objects should always be left to professionals who are sensitive to all of the issues, ensuring that a piece retains or increases its value after restoration. Original artwork can sustain all sorts of damage over its lifetime. Conservators have an obligation to the artwork to recommend the best techniques for preserving it for future generations.\\"Paintings and Frames\\" 2000-2010. Restorers are often trained craftspersons, such as furniture makers, mechanics, or metalsmiths. Some have years of experience in their fields, whereas others are self-taught volunteers. Many of the antique aircraft around the United States are restored by trained aircraft engineers assisted by volunteers, some of whom are men who flew those same aircraft years ago. Given that a single piece of furniture may include wood, glass, inlay, leather and fabric, antique restoration encompasses several skills. Caldararo estimates that 90 percent of USA restorers are self-taught, or have cobbled their skills together from idiosyncratic backgrounds.Nancy Davis Kho. \\"Restoring antiques a nearly lost art.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. January 28, 2009. \\"French Polishing\\" was the industry standard in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, pushed aside by the efficient advantage of modern methods in the Industrial Revolution. Lacquers and spray systems replaced the original French polish finish, which is impractical for mass furniture production due to the labor-intensive process of application. As the desire for antiques was not idle, neither was the need for them to be appropriately restored; thus, the trade has been kept alive by a thread. =Restoration terminology= *Conservation: Detail-oriented process designed to preserve as much original finish and materials as possible while bringing the piece back to as close to its original condition as possible. *Finish restoration: Finish restoration is the process of bringing an existing finish back to life. This involves re- emulsifying the original finish, either shellac or varnish. By using the original solvents to liquefy the solids, their ability to adhere to and penetrate the piece returns. The process also removes the dirt and grime accumulated over years of use. If the finish is very thin, additional layers of the same finish may be applied to bolster the restored finish and ensure longevity. Finish restoration results in an original finish rating: for example, 85% of the original finish remains. The more original finish that remains, the more antique value remains. *Preservation: The process of stopping or slowing deterioration usually does not involve actual restoration or attempts to return the piece to its original condition. Damage and finish deterioration are left intact, but prevented from going further. This process is usually done on museum works; we recommend a conservation or restoration process for home use of antiques. In most cases this is a chemical process that prevents further oxidation of the wood and metals, and in addition adds moisture to the existing finish. *Refinishing: Removing a finish and applying a new finish in its place. This process destroys significant portions of antique value in furniture and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. *Repair: Physical structural replacement or reinforcement of parts of the original piece. May involve addition of new materials altered to appear aged or the application of antique materials to improve appearance of repair and preserve as much value as possible. *Restoration: Bringing a piece back to close to its original condition including structural and finish repairs. *Stripping: stripping involves dipping the piece in a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, and in some cases the glue holding the piece together.Eric & Stanley Saperstein \\"The Philosophy of Restoration\\" December 2002 page 5 Salvage On the other extreme, though most bad old pieces were thrown away long ago, there are pieces that, because of their original design or workmanship or because of damage, are not worth restoring but that are made of re-usable materials such as hard wood, amber, pewter or ivory. As the number of people increases and the number of trees and other natural products in the world decreases, wood and other materials become more scarce. So the fact that the material was not worth doing a good job with when an item was made does not mean that the material should be discarded along with the object now.

He played fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1972 to 1987 for the Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, and Kansas City Royals. He is best remembered for being at the center of one of the most controversial plays in World Series history. Chicago White Sox Orta signed with the Chicago White Sox out of the Mexican Baseball League, and made the team out of Spring training at shortstop without having played in the minor leagues for the Chisox. He batted just .211 through the middle of May to lose his starting job to Rich Morales. He hung around for an additional two months as a utility infielder, but was optioned to the Southern League's Knoxville Sox in mid-July with a .191 batting average, one home run and seven runs batted in. After batting .316 with seven home runs at Knoxville, he returned to Chicago when rosters expanded that September. His second major league home run was an extra innings game winner on September 19 against Gary Waslewski and the Oakland A's. He was shifted over to second base for the season after batting over .500 in spring training. Playing through injuries for much of the year, he batted .266 and tied for second in the AL with eighteen errors committed at second base. After beginning the season batting at the bottom of the White Sox line- up, he was moved up to the number two spot in manager Chuck Tanner's batting order, and batted .411 with 23 runs scored in the month of June. More specifically, he batted .516 with four home runs from June 17 to June 23 to earn AL \\"Player of the Week\\" honors. For the season, his .316 batting average was second only to Minnesota Twins second baseman Rod Carew in the American League. Early in the season, Orta was involved in a controversy when he hit a triple off the wall at Comiskey Park that Cleveland Indians manager Frank Robinson believed should have been called a ground rule double. Robinson argued with first base umpire Jerry Neudecker, eventually shoving him to get ejected from the game and fined by the league. He batted .296 with four home runs and 46 RBIs in the first half to be named to the AL All-Star team, but did not appear in the game due to a pulled hamstring in his right leg. He returned healthy on July 17, and batted .314 with seven home runs and 37 RBIs in the second half. Prior to the start of the season, the White Sox acquired Jack Brohamer from the Cleveland Indians. New Chisox manager Paul Richards opted to use Brohamer at second and Orta at third. Orta proved himself a poor third baseman, and was eventually moved into the outfield while rookie Kevin Bell took over at third. The Sox narrowly avoided a hundred losses in 1976. For his part, Orta batted .274 with hitting a career-high fourteen home runs and scoring a career high 74 runs. Orta returned to second base when Bob Lemon replaced Richards at the helm in . The Chisox returned to their winning ways as they won ninety games to finish third in the American League West. Orta, now batting third in the line-up, finished second on the team (to Richie Zisk) with a career high 84 RBIs. He remained at second in , but was used as the designated hitter by Don Kessinger when he took over as player-manager in . Orta failed to put up the numbers expected of a DH (.212 batting average, 3 home runs, 21 RBIs through June 27). Meanwhile, second base had become something of a revolving door, with Kessinger, Alan Bannister, Joe Gates, Jim Morrison and Greg Pryor all manning the position at one point or another. He returned to second base in the middle of July, and batted .313 with seven home runs and 22 RBIs the rest of the way. Cleveland Indians Following the 1979 season, Orta signed a five-year deal with the Cleveland Indians. With the Indians, Orta became a full-time right fielder, and soon emerged as one of the better fielding right fielders in the league. He maintained a .987 fielding percentage in his two seasons in Cleveland, and his eleven assists in tied for second among A.L. outfielders. On June 15, , he tied an A.L. record for the most hits in one game with six. The feat raised his season average to .339, and likely played a part in his being named Cleveland's sole representative at the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He did not, however, appear in the game. With prospect Von Hayes ready to assume an everyday major league job in right field, Orta became trade-bait at the Winter meetings. On December 9, he and two minor leaguers (Jack Fimple and Larry White) were sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jack Perconte and former Rookie of the Year winning pitcher Rick Sutcliffe. Los Angeles Dodgers With the Dodgers, Orta found himself in a reserve role for the first time in his career. As a pinch hitter, Orta batted just .150 with one home run and five RBIs. He would occasionally spell Pedro Guerrero a day off in right field, and batted .291 in that role. After his only season in Los Angeles, he was traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Pat Zachry. Toronto Blue Jays Shortly after acquiring Orta, the Mets traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Steve Senteney. Orta was used primarily at DH by the Jays, though he did occasionally sub for Jesse Barfield in right. After the season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Willie Aikens. Kansas City Royals Orta made 438 plate appearances in , his most since 1980. He and Hal McRae formed a very successful lefty/righty platoon at DH with the Royals, as the Royals got a .305 batting average, ten home runs and 81 RBIs out of their DH position for the season. Orta also played some outfield, batting .310 with three home runs and fifteen RBIs in that role. His ninth inning sacrifice fly on September 12 defeated the Minnesota Twins to move the Royals into a first place tie in the A.L. West. The race came down to the wire between the Royals, Twins and California Angels with the Royals eventually winning the division by three games over each team. Orta may have been on the receiving end of some gamesmanship on September 20 when Angels catcher Bob Boone accused Orta of using a corked bat after his first at-bat of the game. His bat was confiscated by umpire Jim McKean, and the accusation turned out to be fruitless. Orta led off the fifth with a single with a different bat. Orta's first trip to the post-season did not go as well as he may have hoped. The Royals were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the 1984 American League Championship Series. Orta went one-for-ten with a triple and an RBI. The Royals stuck with the platoon of McRae and Orta at DH in . Though the DH position's batting average dropped to .256, they hit nineteen home runs while driving in 114 runs. The 1985 season once again came down to the wire between the Royals and Angels. The Royals went on an eight- game winning streak at the start of September to jump into first place in the A.L. West for the first time on September 6. They took first place for good when they took three of four games with the Angels in Kansas City toward the end of the season to head to the post-season for the second year in a row. =1985 World Series= Orta was held hitless in five at-bats in the 1985 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. At-bats were hard to come by in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, as it was played under National League rules without the DH in . Orta appeared in games one and two as a pinch hitter, flying out to center each time. The Royals lost both of the first two games held in Kansas City, but surprisingly, took two out of three in St. Louis to return home in a two games to three hole. Game six was a pitchers' duel between the Royals' Charlie Leibrandt and St. Louis' Danny Cox. Each held the opposing team scoreless through seven innings before the Cards finally broke through for a run in the eighth. Orta was called upon to pinch hit for Pat Sheridan leading off the ninth inning with the Royals down 1-0. He hit a slow roller Cardinal first baseman Jack Clark fielded, and flipped to pitcher Todd Worrell covering first. First base umpire Don Denkinger called Orta safe on what turned out to be a very close play, but television replays showed that Worrell beat him to the bag. The following batter, Steve Balboni hit a pop foul that ended up falling between Clark and catcher Darrell Porter. Given new life, Balboni hit a single to left on the very next pitch, moving Orta to second base. With Onix Concepci√≥n pinch running for Balboni, Jim Sundberg followed with an unsuccessful sacrifice bunt in which Orta was thrown out at third. The next batter was Hal McRae, pinch hitting for Buddy Biancalana. After Porter allowed a passed ball that allowed both runners to move up a base, McRae was intentionally walked to load the bases. Dane Iorg, pinch hitting for Dan Quisenberry, singled to right field driving in two runs, and giving Kansas City a 2‚Äì1 win. The only out recorded by the Cardinals in the inning was Orta at third. The win shifted momentum of the Series to the Royals, who won the Series the next night on Bret Saberhagen's 11‚Äì0 shutout. Years of debate between Cardinals' and Royals' fans have followed over what might have happened if Orta had been put out at first instead of third. Retirement Orta shared DH duties with Hal McRae in as well. In , with rookie Kevin Seitzer ready to assume a starting job at third base, Hall of Famer George Brett was shifted to first base, and Balboni became the Royals' DH. Orta was released June 17, followed by McRae on July 21. Career statistics In 1755 games over 16 seasons, Orta posted a .278 batting average (1619-for-5829) with 733 runs, 267 doubles, 63 triples, 130 home runs, 745 RBI, 79 stolen bases, 500 bases on balls, .334 on-base percentage and .412 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .973 fielding percentage. In 8 postseason games, he hit only .111 (2-for-18) with 1 run, 1 triple and 1 RBI. Personal life Orta was born in Mazatl√°n from Cuban parents. His father Pedro Orta, former baseball player and a legend of Cuban baseball and Mexican League.

As its name suggests, it was intended primarily for use in rock music, where a standard acoustic harpsichord would be drowned out. The Rock-Si-Chord, manufactured by Rocky Mount Instruments (RMI), a division of Allen Organs Inc, was a solid-state instrument using one or two transistor oscillators per key, and was the first example of a type of instrument generally known as the electronic piano (contrast electric piano). Later RMI instruments also included piano sounds. The prototype Rock-Si-Chord gave the Philadelphia psychedelic rock band The Mandrake Memorial their signature sound. Composer George Crumb specifies the use of an electric harpsichord in his 1968 composition \\"Songs, Drones, and Refrains of Death\\"; however, he does not specifically call in the score for a Rock-Si-Chord, and thus it could also refer to a Baldwin Combo Harpsichord, an electromechanical instrument dating from the same era. Around the same time Terry Riley used a Rock-Si-Chord, among other keyboard instruments, in his piece \\"A Rainbow in Curved Air\\" (1969). Orchestrator Jonathan Tunick used a combined Rock-Si-Chord/Electric Piano in the Stephen Sondheim musical Company (1970). He considers the instrument now obsolete and recommends the use of a current electric keyboard.

Laird, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 299 (1803), was a case decided by the John Marshall-led U.S. Supreme Court, notably a week after the famous Marbury v. Madison. The case regards a circuit judge's judgment, after the judge's job had been abolished by the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801. Stuart's lawyer was Charles Lee, who also represented William Marbury. John Laird asked the Supreme Court to uphold the judge's ruling, while Stuart's team argued that only the court that renders a judgment can enforce it and the 1802 repeal of 1801's Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. Stuart lost on both accounts, and a dangerous showdown between the legislative and the judicial branches of the US government was averted. The case involved the Judiciary Act of 1801, which created a number of federal judgeships, the so-called \\"midnight judges,\\" as the Act was passed by the lame-duck Federalists in their final days in office. The Act established new circuit court judges to hear intermediate appeals. As a result, Supreme Court justices would no longer have to \\"ride circuit,\\" which entailed substantial and often dangerous travel, to sit with district (trial) court judges to hear appeals throughout the nation. Soon after its passage, the statute was invalidated by the Repeal Act of March 8, 1802. Federalists attacked the Jeffersonian legislation by arguing that federal judges were appointed for life and so could not be constitutionally removed by the Repeal Act. The Judiciary Act of 1802 reinstated circuit courts but also resurrected the practice of circuit riding. Many thought the new 1802 Act unconstitutional, including new Chief Justice John Marshall. He argued that justices should not have to preside over circuit courts unless they were commissioned as circuit court judges. He wrote the other justices, \\"I am not of opinion that we can under our present appointments hold circuit courts, but I presume a contrary opinion is held by the Court and, if so, I shall conform to it.\\" Justice Samuel Chase agreed with Marshall, but the other justices did not. With Marshall not participating (but very much active behind the scenes), Justice William Paterson held for a unanimous Court that Congress had the authority under the Constitution both to establish and to abolish lower federal courts. Despite the Court sustaining the Judiciary Act of 1802, the issue of circuit riding was substantially lessened because the Act in effect made circuit riding optional: only one federal judge was required for a quorum on any circuit court. As a result, Supreme Court justices could rely on district court judges to hear intermediate appeals. This flexibility proved crucial to the demise of circuit riding. By the 1840s, the justices had all but stopped holding circuit courts. Scholars such as Bruce Ackerman have pointed to the Court's decision in Stuart v. Laird as part of the opposition Federalist Court's accommodation of the new Jeffersonian political regime. See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 5 * Marbury v.

Biography  Maynard was born in Easingwold, North Yorkshire on 5 July 1921. Dubbed \\"Stalin's Granny\\" owing to her left- wing views, Maynard was a leading activist in the National Union of Agricultural Workers becoming vice-president of the union and being narrowly beaten to its presidency. She joined the Labour Party in 1946 and served as a councillor on North Yorkshire County Council. She was elected to Labour's National Executive Committee 1972‚Äì82 and 1983‚Äì87, and was Vice-Chair of the Labour Party 1980‚Äì81. She was appointed a Justice of the Peace at Thirsk in 1950. Having acted as Labour agent in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, Maynard was elected in 1974 as MP for Sheffield Brightside and held the seat until she retired in 1987. Throughout her political career Maynard advocated policies on the left of the Labour Party and chaired the left-wing Campaign Group. She served on the Agriculture Select Committee 1975‚Äì87. She played a leading role in securing the passage of the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 which regulated the tied cottage system that had caused misery to rural workers. Jeremy Corbyn MP, Leader of the Labour Party from 2015-20, said that Maynard became a 'great friend' to him when he first joined the House of Commons in 1983. He recounted that Maynard had told him that \\"If both front benches are agreed, it‚Äôs probably bad news for the workers. And if a minister ever gets up and says ‚Äòwe‚Äôre going to have to take some tough choices and some tough decisions,‚Äô it‚Äôs a disaster for the working class. Just bear that in mind and you‚Äôll not go far wrong.\\" Maynard died of cancer in Sowerby, North Yorkshire on 27 March 1998, the same day as fellow former MP, Joan Lestor. Her remains are buried alongside her immediate family at Thornton-le-Street. Bibliography *Mason-O'Connor, Kristine (2003). Joan Maynard: A Passionate Socialist.

In the outcome he became the 69th Minister of Finance for one day only on 30 May 1926, then becoming interim Minister for Foreign Affairs for two days between 30 May and 1 June, after which he again became the 70th Minister for Finance on the same day. He served as the ninth President of the Republic (the first of the Military dictatorship) and Prime Minister for a brief period of time (from 31 May 1926 to 16 June 1926).  Career  Mendes Cabe√ßadas was one of those responsible for the revolt on board the ship Adamastor, during the Republican Revolution of 1910. However he soon became disappointed with the regime he had helped to create. In 1926 he led the revolution against the First Republic in Lisbon after Gomes da Costa had started it in Braga. Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Maria da Silva resigned and, just days later (31 May), President Bernardino Machado named him Prime Minister. On the same day the President also resigned and Mendes Cabe√ßadas assumed the role of President of the Republic. As a revolutionary with moderate tendencies, he thought it possible to form a government that wouldn't question the constitutional regime, but with no influence on the Democratic Party. However the other revolutionaries (among them Gomes da Costa and √ìscar Carmona) judged him as incapable and in a meeting in Sacav√©m on 17 June 1926, Mendes Cabe√ßadas was forced to renounce the posts of President of the Republic and President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) in favour of Gomes da Costa. He joined the opposition to the regime for a third time, involving himself in several revolutionary attempts and subscribed to many manifestos against the dictatorship, until his death in 1965 during the period known as the Estado Novo (New State), headed by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar.  Personal life  He married in Santa Isabel, Lisbon, in March 1911 Maria das Dores Formosinho Vieira (Silves, Silves, 6 January 1880 ‚Äì 22 December 1949) and had four daughters.

Early life Born in Algona, Iowa, Wilkinson was a promising pitcher until he hurt his throwing wrist. He turned to team ownership and management, parlaying a promotional flair into an association with the game that lasted more than 50 years. Team ownership In 1909, he developed a women's baseball team‚Äîpossibly with a few men in drag‚Äîto draw up to 2,000 fans to a covered grandstand moved around the Midwest by train. A team band whipped up tunes for crowds, a male catcher wrestled all comers and a brown bulldog served as the mascot. Town teams throughout Iowa and surrounding states faced Wilkinson's gimmick-laden squad. In 1912, he founded the multi-racial All Nations team in Des Moines, Iowa. The team consisted of whites, blacks, Polynesians, Asians, Native Americans and ‚Äì at one time ‚Äì a woman. As did Wilkinson's first venture, it also had a team band and a number of other promotions, but featured a number of athletes of major league calibre, including John Donaldson and Jos√© M√©ndez. He moved the team to Kansas City, Missouri in 1915, and the team continued to barnstorm in the upper Midwest for a few years after the Monarchs were born, still fulfilling its original role but also serving as a farm team for the Monarchs. When the Negro National League was founded in February 1920, Wilkinson built the Monarchs from the best of the All Nations team, and from the 25th Infantry Wreckers, an all-black U.S. Army team that starred Bullet Rogan, \\"Heavy\\" Johnson, Lem Hawkins, and Dobie Moore, among others. Wilkinson was the only white team owner trusted by Rube Foster when the Negro National League was founded; Wilkinson became a trusted member of Foster's inner circle. Stories were told by his players that during the Depression, Wilkinson would bunk with his coaches and players when the team was on the road and hotels were short of rooms. Wilkinson was the first owner in the league to secure the services of African American Umpires for the Negro National League and by 1923, at least six Umpires were non-white.\\"Monarchs Open 1923 Season Tomorrow at Association Park\\" The Kansas City Advocate, Kansas City, KS, Page 1 and 3 During his ownership, the Monarchs won ten league titles and participated in four Negro League World Series, winning in 1924 and 1942. In 1930, Wilkinson's Monarchs became the first professional team to play night baseball, using a portable set of lights. Wilkinson also signed Jackie Robinson to his first professional contract, in 1945. Death and legacy He sold the Monarchs in 1948, and died in poverty in a Kansas City nursing home. \\"Wilkie\\", as he was affectionately known to players, sportswriters and fans, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.

Features Steffen gives several features associated with religious fanaticism or extremism: * \\"Spiritual needs\\"... human beings have a spiritual longing for understanding and meaning, and given the mystery of existence, that spiritual quest can only be fulfilled through some kind of relationship with ultimacy, whether or not that takes the form as a \\"transcendent other.\\" Religion has power to meet this need for meaning and transcendent relationship.Steffen, Lloyd. p. 119. * \\"Attractiveness\\"... it presents itself in such a way that those who find their way into it come to express themselves in ways consistent with the particular vision of ultimacy at the heart of this religious form.Steffen, Lloyd. p. 120. * A \\"live option\\"... it is present to the moral consciousness as a live option that addresses spiritual need and satisfies human longing for meaning, power, and belonging.Steffen, Lloyd. p. 121. Examples of religious fanaticism Jansenist sect having convulsions and spasms as a result of religious fanaticism. Engraving by Bernard Picart =Christianity= Ever since Christianity was established, some of those in authority have sought to expand and control the church, often through the fanatical use of force. Grant Shafer says, \\"Jesus of Nazareth is best known as a preacher of nonviolence\\" Shafer, Grant. p. 193., although in Matthew 10:34 he says, \\"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.\\" The start of Christian fanatic rule came with the Roman Emperor Constantine I. Ellens says, \\"When Christianity came to power in the empire of Constantine, it proceeded almost to viciously repress all non-Christians and all Christians who did not line up with official Orthodox ideology, policy, and practice\\".Ellens, J. Harold. pp. 42‚Äì43. An example of Christians who didn't line up with Orthodox ideology is the Donatists, who \\"refused to accept repentant clergy who had formerly given way to apostasy when persecuted\\".Shafer, Grant. p. 236. Fanatic Christian activity, continued into the Middle Ages with the Crusades. These wars were attempts by the Catholics, sanctioned by the Pope, to reclaim the Holy Land from the Muslims. However many Catholics see the crusades as a just war in self-defense. Charles Selengut, in his book Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence, said: > The Crusades were very much holy wars waged to maintain Christianity's > theological and social control. On their way to conquering the Holy Land > from the Muslims by force of arms, the crusaders destroyed dozens of Jewish > communities and killed thousands because the Jews would not accept the > Christian faith. Jews had to be killed in the religious campaign because > their very existence challenged the sole truth espoused by the Christian > Church.Selengut, Charles. \\"Sacred Fury: Understanding Religious Violence.\\" > p. 22. Shafer adds that, \\"When the crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they killed Muslims, Jews, and native Christians indiscriminately\\".Shafer, Grant. p. 239. Another prominent form of fanaticism according to some came a few centuries later with the Spanish Inquisition. The Inquisition was the monarchy's way of making sure their people stayed within Catholic Christianity. Selengut said, \\"The inquisitions were attempts at self-protection and targeted primarily \\"internal enemies\\" of the church\\".Selengut, Charles. p. 70. The driving force of the Inquisition was the Inquisitors, who were responsible for spreading the truth of Christianity. Selengut continues, saying: > The inquisitors generally saw themselves as educators helping people > maintain correct beliefs by pointing out errors in knowledge and judgment... > Punishment and death came only to those who refused to admit their errors > ... during the Spanish Inquisitions of the fifteenth century, the clear > distinction between confession and innocence and remaining in error became > muddled.... The investigators had to invent all sorts of techniques, > including torture, to ascertain whether ... new converts' beliefs were > genuine. During the reformation Christian fanaticism increased between Catholics and the recently formed protestants, many Christians were killed for having rival view point. The reformation set of a chain of sectarian wars between the Catholics and the sectarian protestant culminating in the wars of religions. =Islam= Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the Kharijites. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi øa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death. Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri have promoted the overthrow of secular governments. Sayyid Qutb, a figurehead of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, was influential in promoting a Pan-Islamist ideology in the 1960s. When Qutb was executed by the Egyptian government, Ayman al-Zawahiri formed the organization Egyptian Islamic Jihad to replace the government with an Islamic state that would reflect Qutb's ideas for Islamic revival. The Qutbist ideology has been influential in jihadist movements that seek to overthrow secular governments, and Qutb's books have been frequently been cited by Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki.Robert Irwin, \\"Is this the man who inspired Bin Laden?\\" The Guardian (1 November 2001).Paul Berman, \\"The Philosopher of Islamic Terror\\", New York Times Magazine (23 March 2003).Out of the Shadows: Getting ahead of prisoner radicalizationQutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism by Dale C. Eikmeier. From Parameters, Spring 2007, pp. 85‚Äì98. Since Osama bin Laden's fatwa in 1998, radical jihad has increasingly become an internationally recognized term. Bin Laden's concept, though, is very different from the actual meaning of the term. In the religious context, jihad most nearly means \\"working urgently for a certain godly objective, generally an imperialist one\\".Ellens, J. Harold. p. 45. The word jihad in Arabic means 'struggle'. The struggle can be a struggle of implementing the Islamic values in daily activities, a struggle with others to counter arguments against Islam, or self-defense when physically attacked because of belief in Islam. According to Steffen, there are portions of the Qur'an where military jihad is used. As Steffen says, though, \\"Jihad in these uses is always defensive. Not only does ‚Äòjihad' not endorse acts of military aggression, but ‚Äòjihad' is invoked in Qur'anic passages to indicate how uses of force are always subject to restraint and qualification\\".Steffen, Lloyd. p. 224. This kind of jihad differs greatly from the kind most commonly discussed today. Thomas Farr, in an essay titled \\"Islam's Way to Freedom\\", says that, \\"Even though most Muslims reject violence, the extremists' use of sacred texts lends their actions authenticity and recruiting power\\". (Freedom 24) He goes on to say, \\"The radicals insist that their central claim ‚Äì God's desire for Islam's triumph ‚Äì requires no interpretation. According to them, true Muslims will pursue it by any means necessary, including dissimulation, civil coercion, and the killing of innocents\\". (Freedom 24) According to certain observers this disregard for others and rampant use of violence is markedly different from the peaceful message that jihad is meant to employ. Although fanatic jihadists have committed many terroristic acts throughout the world, perhaps the best known is the September 11 attacks. According to Ellens, the al-Qaeda members who took part in the terrorist attacks did so out of their belief that, by doing it, they would \\"enact a devastating blow against the evil of secularized and non-Muslim America. They were cleansing this world, God's temple\\".Ellens, J. Harold. p. 35.

Along with his two brothers ‚ÄìCarlos and Juan‚Äì Florentino Ameghino was one of the most important founding figures in South American paleontology. From 1887 until his death, Ameghino was passionately devoted to the study of fossil mammals from Patagonia, with the valuable support of his brother Carlos Ameghino (1865‚Äì1936) who, between 1887 and 1902, made 14 trips to that region, where he discovered and collected numerous fossil faunas and made important stratigraphic observations which helped to support his journal Ameghiniana. Biography Born in Moneglia, and migrated in Argentina with his parents when he was just 1 year old , Ameghino was a self-taught naturalist, and focused his study on the lands of the southern Pampas. He formed one of the largest collections of fossils of the world at the time, which served him as base for numerous geological and paleontological studies. Ameghino was a leading pioneer in the development of phylogenetics and of the paleontological approach of evolutionary biology. He also investigated the possible presence of prehistoric man in the Pampas and made several controversial claims about human origins in South America. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, president of Argentina 1868‚Äì1874, described Ameghino as \\"a countryman from Mercedes that nobody knows of here, but that is admired by scholars worldwide.\\" The Antiquity of Man in the R√≠o de la Plata, later translated into French, was published in 1878. Phylogeny, published in 1884, was a theoretical work on developing an evolutionary concept in the Lamarckian vein, and led to the establishment of zoological taxonomy as a discipline with mathematical foundations. He later directed the Department of Zoology at the National University of C√≥rdoba, which awarded him with an honorary doctorate, and was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences of Argentina. Ameghino worked with Francisco P. Moreno, founder and director of the La Plata Museum, as deputy director, secretary, and director of the Paleontology Department upon its establishment in 1888. Ameghino enriched his department with his own collection, which he sold to the provincial government for the purpose. But it was little time in which these two scientists worked together. A year later his magnum opus appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mammalian Fossils in the Argentine Republic, comprising 1028 pages and an atlas. This latter contribution to the knowledge of the fossil mammals of Argentina won the bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris. He later served as director of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum, in Buenos Aires, and in 1906 published Sedimentary Formations of the Cretaceous and Tertiary Eras in Patagonia, a work of synthesis is not limited to descriptions, but it raises hypotheses about the evolution of various mammals and analyzes the different layers of the crust and their possible ages. Ameghino returned between 1907 and 1911 to his earlier dedication: anthropology, the descriptions of the first inhabitants, industries and cultures. His published works include 24 volumes of between 700 and 800 pages each, containing classifications, studies, comparisons and descriptions of more than 9000 extinct animals, many discovered by him. This was an important contribution to the known catalog of extinct mammals, and would, along with the Ameghino collection, be consulted by scientists from America and Europe in subsequent years. He died from the symptoms of diabetes in La Plata in 1911. The Ameghino Crater on the Moon is named in his honor. The Florentino Ameghino Partido and its county seat of Ameghino, situated in the north-west of Buenos Aires Province, are also named after him, as is the palaeontology journal Ameghiniana. Several Argentine cities are named Florentino Ameghino as well as various educational institutions across the country, libraries and museums, squares, schools, parks and other locations. This is a list of places in Argentina named in honour of Florentino Ameghino: The square Parque Florentino Ameghino, located in Buenos Aires; the Florentino Ameghino Department, administrative division of the Province of Chubut; the judicial district Florentino Ameghino Partido, legal jurisdiction of the Province of Buenos Aires; Florentino Ameghino, Buenos Aires, a city in the Province of Buenos Aires; Florentino Ameghino, a town in the Province of Misiones; the Florentino Ameghino Dam, artificial lake in the Province of Chubut; the Villa Dique Florentino Ameghino, a small town in the Province of Chubut; Florentino Ameghino, a town in the Province of Chubut; the petrified forest \\"Bosque Petrificado Florentino Ameghino\\"[1] in the province of Chubut; the school \\"Colegio Nacional Florentino Ameghino\\", located in the city of Mercedes, Buenos Aires Province; Ameghino Gully and Florentino Ameghino Refuge in Antarctica; the municipal garden in the city of Miramar, Buenos Aires Province has the name \\"Vivero Dun√≠cola Florentino Ameghino\\" and a club from the city of Necochea in the province of Buenos Aires, among others. Selected publications Pyrotherium romeroi or beast of fire named in honor of Argentine Army Captain Antonio Romero who sent a tusk, a premolar, and two molars to Ameghino. P. romeroi is a large extinct mammal whose fossil remains were described and classified by Ameghino.

The term \\"chlorogenic acids\\" refers to a related polyphenol family of esters, including hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid) with quinic acid. Despite the \\"chloro\\" of the name, chlorogenic acids contain no chlorine. Instead, the name comes from the Greek œáŒªœâœÅœåœÇ (light green) and -Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ (a suffix meaning \\"giving rise to\\"), pertaining to the green color produced when chlorogenic acids are oxidized.  Structural properties  Structurally, chlorogenic acid is the ester formed between caffeic acid and the 3-hydroxyl of L-quinic acid. Isomers of chlorogenic acid include the caffeoyl ester at other hydroxyl sites on the quinic acid ring: 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (cryptochlorogenic acid or 4-CQA) and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (neochlorogenic acid or 5-CQA). The epimer at position 1 has not yet been reported. Structures having more than one caffeic acid group are called isochlorogenic acids, and can be found in coffee. There are several isomers, such as 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. and cynarine (1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) UV‚Äìvisible spectrum with a maximum of absorbance at 325 nm Biosynthesis and natural occurrence 4-Coumaroyl-CoA is the biosynthetic precursor to chlorogenic acid. The biosynthetic precursor to chlorogenic acid is 4-coumaroyl-CoA, containing a single hydroxyl group on the aryl ring, which in turn is produced from cinnamic acid. The hydroxylation of the coumaryl ester, i.e. installing the second hydroxy group, is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Chlorogenic acid can be found in the bamboo Phyllostachys edulis, as well as in many other plants, such as the shoots of common heather (Calluna vulgaris). = In food = Chlorogenic acid and the related compounds cryptochlorogenic acid, and neochlorogenic acid have been found in the leaves of Hibiscus sabdariffa. Isomers of chlorogenic acid are found in potatoes. Chlorogenic acid is present in the flesh of eggplants, peaches, prunes and coffee beans.  Medicinal effects Chlorogenic is an important and biologically active dietary polyphenol, playing several important and therapeutic roles such as antioxidant activity, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti- inflammatory, antipyretic, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, antiviral, anti- microbial, anti-hypertension, free radicals scavenger and a central nervous system stimulator. Chlorogenic acid has been studied as a possible chemical sensitizer involved in respiratory allergy to certain plant materials. Taken as a dietary supplement or in coffee, chlorogenic acid slightly reduces blood pressure. Nomenclature The atom-numbering of chlorogenic acid can be ambiguous. The order of numbering of atoms on the quinic acid ring was reversed in 1976 following IUPAC guidelines, with the consequence that 3-CQA became 5-CQA, and 5-CQA became 3-CQA. This article uses the original numbering, which was exclusive prior to 1976, (chlorogenic acid being 3-CQA, while neochlorogenic acid is 5-CQA). Thereafter researchers and manufacturers have been divided, with both numbering systems in use. Even the 1976 IUPAC recommendations are not entirely satisfactory when applied to some of the less common chlorogenic acids.M. N. Clifford and L. Abranko. Some Notes on the Chlorogenic Acids. 1.

Construction of the A-30 dates back to the early days of autoroute construction in the 1960s. Originally called Highway 3, the A-30 was designed to replace Route 132 as the main artery linking the communities along the South Shore of the St. Lawrence River. The A-30 was originally intended to begin at the U.S. border at Dundee and end at Saint- Pierre-les-Becquets (in Centre-du-Qu√©bec).:fr:Autoroute 30 In the late 1970s an eight-year moratorium on new autoroute construction in favour of public transport by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois prevented implementation of that plan. The original section of Autoroute 30 in 1968 linked Sorel-Tracy to Route 116, which was then called Highway 9. The A-30 was extended to an interchange with Autoroute 10 in Brossard by 1985 and to Autoroute 15 in Candiac by 1996. Growing road congestion in and around Montreal led to the announcement in 2006 of a federal-provincial partnership to complete A-30 as southwestern bypass ring road.Wikinews:Canadian PM and Quebec premier announce plans for highway development in Montreal At that time, the section from Ch√¢teauguay to Vaudreuil-Dorion was to be tolled, however by 2009 it was decided to collect tolls only on the St. Lawrence bridge. A-30 was extended north of the St. Lawrence River (over a new crossing) to a realigned interchange with Autoroute 20 and Autoroute 540 in Vaudreuil-Dorion, afterward A-540 was annexed and renamed as an extension of A-30. As construction progressed, short sections of the original A-30 that are bypassed by the new route were converted to spur routes and assigned new route numbers; for instance the old alignment of A-30 south of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield was renamed Autoroute 530. Opened to traffic on December 15, 2012, the realigned Autoroute 30 permits motorists travelling the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor to bypass Montreal. On roule sur la nouvelle 30, Radio Canada (French)Press Release (French) Description There are two discontinuous sections of A-30: =Mont√©r√©gie= The main segment extends from Autoroute 40 in Vaudreuil-Dorion to Route 133 in Sorel-Tracy. From the junction of Autoroute 20 in Vaudreuil-Dorion to Route 138 in Ch√¢teauguay a completely new freeway was constructed between 2007 and 2012, opening to traffic in December 2012. This new section, built under a Public-Private Partnership, along with the former A-540 west of Vaudreuil make up the first of the highway now. An approximately long section bypasses the Mohawk territory of Kahnawake and the South Shore communities of Saint-Constant, Delson, and Candiac. The Kahnawake bypass was built following the 1990 Oka Crisis and extended to the other three communities between 2005 and 2011. The A-30 was originally intended to supplant Route 132, crossing Kahnawake to a junction with the Honor√© Mercier Bridge. Local opposition to the proposed route from the late 1960s coupled with the disruption of the Oka Crisis in 1990 prompted the decision to change the course of the new autoroute to bypass the Mohawk territory This new alignment resulted in the 1990 construction, 1992 twinning, then the 2010 redesignation of a portion of highway as Autoroute 730. The A-730 now extends from the A-30 mainline in Saint-Constant to Route 132 in Sainte-Catherine. Another section from the existing A-30 to Route 132 in Candiac has been redesignated Autoroute 930 since construction of the Jean-Leman section ended in November 2011. Further west, an bypass of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield became Autoroute 530 in 2012 when construction of the A-30 extension was completed. Northeast of Montreal the autoroute parallels Route 132, bypassing the steelmaking centres of Contrecoeur and Sorel-Tracy. =Centre-du-Qu√©bec= An 18.3 km super two segment in B√©cancour, from Route 132 immediately west to an interchange with Autoroute 55 (near Laviolette Bridge, south of Trois-Rivi√®res). The A-30 parallels the St. Lawrence River, bypassing the communities of Sainte-Ang√®le-de-Laval and Des Ormeaux and linking the Port of B√©cancour to the autoroute network. Multiplexed with Route 132, the A-30 continues as a two-lane road for a short distance further before ending at the western approach to Gentilly. The road continues on as Route 132. Exit list Extension of Autoroute 30 (Montreal Bypass Project) The completion of Autoroute 30 as a southern bypass was intended to better integrate greater Montreal's network of autoroutes, significantly reduce transit time to and through the region, boost economic activity in Mont√©r√©gie, and improve access to markets in Ontario (via Ontario highways 401 and 417) and the United States (via Interstates 87 and 89). This new section was completed on December 15, 2012.Radio Canada The westernmost section was financed through a public‚Äìprivate partnership, in which the government contracted with Acciona (a Spanish engineering and construction company) to design, construct, operate, maintain, and finance the autoroute. The eastern section of the A-30 extension was publicly funded.National archivesCTV TopStories =Candiac‚ÄìCh√¢teauguay= Eastbound A-30 in Saint-Constant Construction of this portion of the A-30‚Äîfrom an interchange with the A-15 (and the spur A-930) in Candiac to Ch√¢teauguay‚Äîbegan in 2005 and opened to traffic on November 19, 2010.

The A-30 crosses the St. Lawrence River to a redesigned interchange with A-20 and the former A-540. The new river crossing expedites the region's access to Toronto via A-20 and Ontario Highway 401. A-540 (a short spur road connecting A-20 with A-40) was re-designated A-30 once construction was complete. Thus, A-30's ultimate western terminus is at the junction with A-40, providing access to Ottawa and eastern Ontario via Ontario Highway 417.

The lack of a corresponding Interstate highway corridor in neighbouring New York (and the availability of nearby Interstate 87) has further diminished the importance of this area as a border crossing. Though unsigned as such, a short freeway extension west of the interchange with A-55 with overpasses that was built wide enough to accommodate unbuilt freeway lanes recall Transports-Qu√©bec's original plans for A-30. There are currently no plans to close the A-30 gap between Sorel-Tracy and B√©cancour, or extend A-30 at all in the area, as the current annual average daily traffic levels on Route 132 are insufficient to justify such a project.

His kingdom is situated in the Berry and is named \\"Terre Deserte\\", or \\"Land Laid Waste\\", so called because of the destruction Uther Pendragon had wrought there. Claudas appears as the Round Table's adversary in Perlesvaus, the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. He wages war on Kings Ban and Bors in the early period of Arthur's reign, and succeeds in conquering many of their lands. Ban and Bors help Arthur in his conflicts against rebellious kings in Britain, but Arthur is unable to send them reinforcements to deal with Claudas. Bors dies fighting against Claudas, who takes in his sons Bors the Younger and Lionel and has them raised as prisoners in his court. When Ban dies, his son Lancelot is swept away by the Lady of the Lake to be raised in her underwater palace. Arthur pursues a truce with Claudas that lasts some time. When they are older, Lionel and Bors kill Claudas' son Dorin, but escape to join their cousin with the Lady of the Lake. All three eventually go to Camelot and become Knights of the Round Table. Years later, after Claudas has imprisoned a cousin of Guinevere's, Arthur, Bors and Lionel decide to settle the score for good. They defeat him and win back the lands of Ban and Bors, and all the other lands Claudas had acquired. The old king goes to Rome in disgrace. Claudas' son Claudin becomes an excellent knight and a virtuous man, eventually joining Bors, Percival, Galahad, and eight others to become the only knights to witness the Holy Grail. Claudas may be based on historical Frankish kings, especially Clodio and Clovis I. The conquests of Claudas resemble those of Clovis, and he is sometimes even said to be Clovis' ancestor.

Detail of a fashion plate from the Sartorial Arts Journal, New York, 1901 A Norfolk jacket is a loose, belted, single-breasted tweed jacket with box pleats on the back and front, with a belt or half-belt. It was originally designed as a shooting coat that did not bind when the elbow was raised to fire. Its origin is uncertain but it may have been named after Coke of Norfolk, the Duke of Norfolk, or after the county of Norfolk. It was made fashionable after the 1860s in the sporting circle of the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, whose country residence was Sandringham House in Norfolk. The style was long popular for boys' jackets and suits, and is still used in some (primarily military and police) uniforms. History There have been several theories regarding the origin of the Norfolk jacket, although none are supported by much evidence. The first theory is that the jacket originated with Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, who invented it for use as a hunting coat in the late 1860s. According to this theory, the jacket was then discovered by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), whose country residence was at Sandringham House in Norfolk, and was made popular by him in the 1880s. No pictures of the prince in such a garment exist, however. Another theory is that the jacket was invented by Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (1754‚Äì1842), known as Coke of Norfolk, who regularly hosted guests such as the then Prince of Wales (the future George IV) for duck-shooting events at his estate in Holkham, Norfolk. It is also possible that there is no specific origin story, and the jacket was named as such simply because it was invented in the county of Norfolk. The jacket has been modified several times since its invention, and its original form is now unknown. A version popularised in the 1930s consisted of a larger version of a sportscoat, together with a belt. Alfonso XIII wearing a Norfolk Jacket during a chamois hunt in Picos de Europa, 1912 Types There are many types of Norfolk jacket, with variations including the type of pleat used, and the style of the belt. Popular varieties today include the full Norfolk jacket, which features three or four buttons in a single-breasted layout, with pleats and a full belt; and the half Norfolk jacket which is less pleated and has only a half belt. Both these types have a notched lapel and a patch pocket. The Norfolk suit is an attire in which a Norfolk jacket is combined with matching trousers to form a full suit. This style was popular in the 1930s and 1940s but is rare today. Uses The Norfolk jacket has been employed in the military in the past, for example in the Australian Armed Forces in 1916, in which the women's uniform featured a Norfolk jacket combined with a felt hat, and by the North-West Mounted Police in Canada in the 1870s.

(photo: Simon Speed) A feeder is a vessel or contraption used by beekeepers to feed pollen or honey (or substitutes) to honey bees from a honey bee colony. Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources. Feeders may exist outside the hive, be designed to fit certain hive designs, be an integral part of a hive design, or be used separately inside the hive. Feeders may attach to the side of the hive, or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the hive or as a purpose-built hive component.  Pollen feeder  Pollen can be fed from outside or inside the hive. When pollen or a pollen supplement is fed it can be fed as a powder, granules or in pattie form. Pollen feeders are usually used at the beginning of the brood rearing season. Syrup feeder  Sugary syrup, which can be HFCS or dissolved table sugar, can be fed from outside the hive or inside the hive. When syrup is fed outside the hive the usual arrangement is a 5gal bucket filled with syrup and a floating perch. In the absence of a float, many bees will drown in the sugary solution. Inside the hive, syrup feeders are either hanging like frames or put on top of the hive, so called hive-top feeders. Hive-top feeders can be a specially designed hive boxes or an inverted bucket with a screened hole. Syrup feeders with a 2:1 concentration of water and sugar by weight are typically used in the fall after the last honey is removed. At the beginning of the brood rearing season in the late winter or spring a 1:1 concentration of water and sugar is typically used. Use and disuse The use of feeders by the bees stops when it either gets too cold or the bees collect other food sources. To avoid contaminating honey with sugar syrup, bees should not be fed syrup when the honey supers are on.

The regiment currently consists of a single light infantry battalion (1st Battalion, 69th Infantry Regiment) and is part of the 27th Infantry Brigade of the 42nd Infantry Division. Its history dates back to 1849, when it was created as the 9th Regiment New York State Militia, and A Company, 1/69 can trace roots back to the American Revolution as one of several National Guard units with colonial roots. The regiment has seen combat in five wars: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War. It has also participated in 23 campaigns, so many that the staffs of its regimental colors are authorized to be one foot longer than normal to accommodate them all. Early history and lineage Late in the 20th century, the U.S. Army changed the lineage and the founding date of the 69th Regiment from 1851 to 21 December 1849 with Company A, 1st Battalion descending from the 8th Company of the New York Regiment of the American Revolutionary War. =Unrelated federal units designated as 69th Infantry Regiment= During the period when the \\"Fighting 69th\\" was assigned the National Guard \\"100 Series\\" regiment number of 165th Infantry, two other federal units were shortly designated the 69th Infantry. Neither of these unrelated federal units ever saw combat. The first federal 69th Infantry Regiment was constituted 9 July 1918 in the Regular Army as the 69th Infantry and assigned to the 10th Infantry Division, organized 10 August 1918 at Camp Funston, Kansas, from personnel of the 41st Infantry. Relieved from the 10th Division and demobilized 13 February 1919 at Camp Funston. The second federal 69th Infantry Regiment was constituted 1 October 1933 in the Regular Army as the 69th Infantry (Light Tank) and allotted to the Seventh Corps Area. Organized about 1936 with headquarters at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Disbanded 11 November 1944. =Irish Revolutionary Movement origins= Thomas Francis Meagher After the failed Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848, Irish revolutionary activity moved to New York City. Irish patriots believed they needed an Irish Brigade to free Ireland from Britain. In late 1848, they organized independent military companies in the city. Drills were held at the Center Market and by mid-1849 a skeleton of the First Irish Regiment had been formed. It is to this regiment that the 69th traces its lineage. Michael Doheny, a refugee from the failed 1848 Revolt, was a company commander in this regiment. He was instrumental in the founding of all the early Irish regiments. In 1849, Irish revolutionary leaders in New York City convinced the state to form an Irish regiment from the independent companies. On 21 December 1849 the First Irish Regiment was adopted by the state. Michael Doheny, Richard O‚ÄôGorman, and James Huston, (who had participated in the failed Irish Revolt of 1848) and Michael Phelan, who had not, all believed in training soldiers within the New York State Militia to free Ireland. As a result, the \\"original Ninth Regiment\\", formed in 1799, was disbanded 27 May 1850 and its companies transferred to the Eighth Regiment. Two days later, on 29 May 1850, the First Irish Regiment was mustered into the New York State Militia as the 9th Regiment with Colonel Benjamin Clinton Ferris, Commander. The Second Irish Regiment was organized on 12 October 1851 and mustered into the New York State Militia on 1 November 1851 as the 69th Regiment. Michael Doheny left the 9th and was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 69th. In May 1852, the 72d Regiment, was established on Long Island. Thomas Francis Meagher, another leader of the failed Rebellion of 1848, escaped to New York in 1852. Doheny then began to organize another Irish Regiment with Meagher as the commander. Doheny left the 69th to become the Lt. Colonel of this new 75th Regiment formed from new and existing companies as the Republican Rifles (4th Irish Regiment). Since Meagher was rarely in New York, Doheny was the actual commander. The Irish Brigade was now substantially in place by the summer of 1853. Leaders moved between the three regiments throughout the 1850s. Captain James Huston left the 9th to join the 69th as did Michael Doheny. Meagher was elected lieutenant colonel by the 69th in 1855 but declined the position as he was not a citizen. The three Irish regiments co-existed until late 1858 when all three were rolled into the 69th. Thus the rest of the Irish Brigade went out of existence until the Civil War. The 9th Regiment ceased to exist until 1859 when it was once again organized. =Tensions in New York City= Michael Corcoran The new Irish Catholic regiments caused uneasiness among American \\"Nativists\\" of the Know Nothing Party whose membership was limited to Protestant males of British American lineage. In 1852, the Nativists formed a new militia regiment designated the 71st Regiment, the \\"American Guard\\", commanded by Colonel Vosburg until he died in 1861. Although the 69th and the 71st represented opposite views and had no contact during the 1850s, they became close in 1861 when both were stationed in Washington prior to the First Battle of Bull Run. Within the 9th Regiment, Captain James Houston commanded a secret organization of Irish revolutionaries known as the \\"SF\\". The \\"SF\\" (called \\"Silent Friends\\" by Patrick D. O‚ÄôFlaherty) was called the \\"Sinn Feins\\" by J.C.P. Stokes, the Historian of the 9th Regiment in his 4 November 1953 letter to BG Keys concerning the history of the Irish 9th. The 1854 Crimean War was an opportunity for Irish Revolutionaries but disputes between James Huston (leader of the SFs) and Michael Doheny crippled any action. Huston left the 69th but conflicts continued. Although radical Irish societies were formed, all attempts to strike a blow for Ireland failed. Conflicts between Archbishop Hughes and the Irish Revolutionary leaders further exacerbated the situation. In 1855, racial, religious, and political tension was high in New York City. In January, the prominent Anglo-American gang leader \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Poole was killed. Two Irishmen were arrested for the crime. The Know Nothings tried to stir up anti-Catholic sentiments. There were several riots and both the 69th and the 9th were called to restore order. It was decided that military units would not march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade because of the tensions. On St. Patrick's Day 1855, the 9th, 69th, 7th and 12th Regiments were held at the parade ground to await orders rather than march in the parade. As soon as the 69th was released, they marched with fixed bayonets down Broadway through the park before they were dismissed. The other military units did not march. Other states eliminated ethnic oriented militias in the 1850s because of similar tensions. By 1858 the only Irish regiment remaining would be the 69th. A new Irish secret society called the Fenians arose. Although not powerful within the 9th, they were extremely so within the 69th. After the consolidation with the 9th in 1858, the 69th adopted the 9th name of \\"National Cadets\\". The Fenians were founded as the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood in 1858 by James Stephens, a leader of the 1848 Revolt. Michael Corcoran was second in command. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Corcoran commanded the 69th Regiment and was also the head of the Fenians. As their leader, he advised the Fenian membership not to join the militia. =The Prince of Wales Parade= In 1860, Michael Corcoran was named Colonel of the 69th. He gained fame and notoriety when he refused to parade the regiment for the visiting Prince of Wales protesting the British imposition of the Irish Famine. He was placed under arrest, but the charges were dropped when the bombardment of Fort Sumter began the American Civil War. During the Civil War, Irish Republican leaders supported the Irish militia. Michael Phalen (leader of the SF group within the 9th) and Richard O‚ÄôGorman, raised funds for families of 69th soldiers wounded at Bull Run in 1861. Huston was killed at Gettysburg in 1863. Meagher returned from Bull Run to form the new Irish Brigade. Corcoran, captured at Bull Run, returned to New York and formed another Irish Brigade called Corcoran's Legion. Doheny died in 1862. In the early 1850s, he had stopped believing that Irish units should be organized within the militia system since it created a conflict of allegiances.Bilby, Joseph G.,Remember Fontenoy!: the 69th New York and the Irish Brigade in the American Civil War, Longstreet House, 1995.

Michael Corcoran at left The 69th Infantry Regiment traces its Civil War honors through three units, the 1st Regiment of the Irish Brigade (69th Infantry New York State Volunteers (NYSV) (1st Regiment of the Irish Brigade)), the 182nd New York Volunteer Infantry (69th Artillery, serving as infantry, the 1st Regiment of Corcoran's Legion) and the 69th National Guard Infantry (State Militia). The Irish Brigade was noted for its ability to tackle tough missions. As one war correspondent said during the Civil War, \\"When anything absurd, forlorn, or desperate was to be attempted, the Irish Brigade was called upon.\\" =Bull Run= The 69th New York Militia was called up and sent to Washington in April 1861. After engaging in the assault in the First Battle of Bull Run, the regiment, along with the Fire Zouaves, formed the rear-guard of the Union Army and protected it as it made its retreat towards Washington. The commander, Col. Michael Corcoran, was taken prisoner during two charges at a Confederate artillery battery. Besides their colonel and second-in-command, the 69th sustained losses of 41 officers and men killed, 85 wounded and 60 prisoners. Thomas Francis Meagher, Captain of the regiment's Zouave company, was promoted to colonel. The immense painting commemorating this, \\"Return of the 69th (Irish) Regiment\\" by Louis Lang, is on display at the New York Historical Society Return of the 69th (Irish) Regiment, N.Y.S.M. from the Seat of War, 1862‚Äì63, Louis Lang =The Seven Days= After 90 days service, the 69th New York State Militia was mustered out and re-enrolled as the 69th New York State Volunteers.69th NewYork Militia Soldiers Returned from War and then Signed up Again in August 1861.

Retrieved on 2013-08-17. Meagher proposed the creation of an Irish Brigade in which the 69th would form the first regiment. Meagher was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the new brigade. The \\"Irish Brigade\\", then 3,000 strong, saw heavy action during the Seven Days battles. =Malvern Hill and Antietam= Irish Brigade. Note the use of civilian hats by the men.

At Malvern Hill, the 69th led the brigade in a charge against advancing Southern troops. The 69th forced the retreat of the famed Confederate Irish Regiment Louisiana Tigers, an event for which General Robert E. Lee gave the regiment its nickname, \\"The Fighting 69th\\". Later, in both World War I and in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 69th and the Louisiana Tigers fought side by side against a common enemy. At Antietam, General Meagher personally led the 69th as the Irish Brigade charged the Sunken Road. They fought for three hours and made five charges against dug-in Confederate forces at the Sunken Road. Fighting became hand to hand as the 69th charged into Confederates lines. Eight color bearers were shot down. General Meagher had his horse shot out from under him and he was carried unconscious from the battlefield. Suffering devastating casualties, the 69th withdrew. They suffered 60% casualties. =Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg= The regiment was virtually destroyed in its uphill attack on the well-prepared Confederate positions on Marye's Heights during the Battle of Fredericksburg, suffering more casualties than they had at Antietam. Tragically, Confederate defenders at Mayre's Heights consisted of the 24th Georgia Regiment which was made up of Irish immigrants. Though they were also Irish, the 24th Georgia Regiment repelled their Irish counterparts fiercely. Afterwards, the audacity of the attack was saluted with a rousing cheer by the Confederate defenders. The salute came with a price. The 69th lost 512 out 1,000 men and they lost 14 out of 15 officers. The day after the battle, the 69th was issued its famed \\"2nd Colors\\", one set of which were later given to the Oireachtas by John F. Kennedy on the centennial of the battle. After Chancellorsville, only 300 men remained in the regiment. General Meagher resigned as commander of the Irish Brigade, stating that \\"the brigade ceased to exist.\\" The 69th's commander, Patrick Kelly was named as the new commander of the brigade. At Gettysburg the regiment, vastly outnumbered, held the Wheatfield until it was overwhelmed. At the Wheatfield, using their smooth bore muskets loaded with buck and ball and advancing rapidly, they were initially able to drive Confederate forces back. Other Confederates were advancing, however, and maneuvered around the flanks of the Irish Brigade. Receiving devastating fire on two sides, they were forced to withdraw. Out of 75 men in the regiment that entered this fight, 5 were killed in action, 14 were wounded, and 6 were listed as missing. =Petersburg & Appomattox= Following Gettysburg, the Irish Brigade ceased to exist as a functioning unit and was disbanded in June 1864. The depleted ranks of the 69th Regiment were filled with new volunteers and draftees from New York's Irish ghettoes. At the end of the summer of 1864, the 69th rejoined its Irish comrades as 1st Regiment of the 2nd Irish Brigade. The brigade served until the end of the war and was present at the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. Out of more than 2,000 regiments that served with the Union Army, the 69th lost more men than all but six regiments. =Return and reconstitution= The regiment marched in the Washington, D.C. victory parade and returned to New York. All the regiments of the Irish Brigade were disbanded except the 69th, which remained part of the New York National Guard. The 69th remained a place of unity and culture for Irish Americans in the post war years. It was called into active service in 1898 for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, transported to Chickamauga, Georgia, Tampa, Florida and Huntsville, Alabama, but it did not see combat due to the brevity of that war.Demeter, Richard The Fighting 69th, A History, Cranford Press, 2002 In 1916, the regiment was posted to McAllen, Texas, along the Mexican border during the Punitive expedition.Harris, Stephen L. Duffy's War: Fr. Francis Duffy, Wild Bill Donovan, and the Irish Fighting 69th in World War I, Potomac Books, 2006 World War I 42nd Infantry Division shoulder sleeve insignia. Upon the entry of the United States into World War I, all National Guard regiments received new \\"100 series\\" regimental numbers, and the 69th was renumbered the 165th Infantry Regiment. Doubled in size by new War Department regulations, its ranks were filled with Irish- Americans and New Yorkers detailed from other regiments. After brief training at Camp Mills, Long Island, NY, the regiment was sent to the Western Front in October 1917 as part of the 42nd \\"Rainbow\\" Division in the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) that was commanded by General John J. Pershing. The 69th still retained its Irish symbolism and spirit, and every member since then has been designated an honorary Irishman. As Father Duffy described non- Irish who join the regiment, \\"They are Irish by adoption, Irish by association, or Irish by conviction\\". =Rouge Bouquet= The fighting 69th at training camp shortly before deployment. Colonel Donovan & Father Duffy upon return from France in 1919. Arriving in France in November 1917, the regiment first engaged in training near Valcouleurs and Grand. It then undertook a legendary muddy 80 mile march just after Christmas through the Vosges mountains to Longeau and Luneville. It had its first combat experience on 26 February 1918 in the nearby trenches of the Rouge Bouquet Chaussilles Sector in the Foret de Parroy near the village of Baccarat. While there, it suffered its first combat casualties, including the deaths of 21 men from the 2nd Battalion on 7 March when a dugout collapsed under bombardment. This event was memorialized in Sergeant Joyce Kilmer's poem \\"Rouge Bouquet\\". =Champagne= Sergeant Joyce Kilmer, 1918 RMS Titanic survivor Daniel Buckley, KIA 1918. After participating in numerous raids into German territory and suffering significant casualties from mustard gas attacks, the regiment was placed in reserve in the Baccarat sector. On 18 June, it moved to the Champagne sector near St. Hillaire. There, it and the rest of the Rainbow Division stopped the German advance in the Second Battle of the Marne that began on 14 July. =Ch√¢teau-Thierry= On 24 July, the 42nd Division moved to Chateau Thierry to relieve the embattled U.S. 26th Division. The Fighting 69th led with distinction the crossing of the Ourcq River 28‚Äì31 July, but suffering 264 KIA (including poet Sergeant Joyce Kilmer), 150 MIA, and 1,200 WIA out of the 3,000-man regiment in four days fighting. Having broken the German lines, who were now reluctantly retreating, the 83rd Brigade commander, Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, was looking to press forward. When informed that the other regiments had replied that they were \\"too fatigued\\" but that the decimated 69th replied that it would still \\"consider an order to advance as a compliment\\", he exclaimed \\"By God, it takes the Irish when you want a hard thing done!\\" =St. Mihiel= St. Mihiel, September 1918. Captain John T. Prout at right 1919 After Chateau Thiery, the regiment refitted. Replacements from all over the United States arrived, becoming about 65 percent of the regiment's enlisted men and nearly 75 percent of the officers. Meanwhile, General Pershing, commander of the AEF on the Western Front, had finally amassed enough troops to form an autonomous American field army. Its first battle would be to pinch off the St. Mihiel salient. The Rainbow Division with the Fighting 69th would participate from the right side pressing northwest from Beaumont assisted by Lieutenant Colonel George Patton's 1st Tank Brigade. Many days of marches through the rain brought the 69th to the jump off point by 10 September, but the rain delayed the start to 12 September. The Germans sensed the build-up and were in the process of withdrawing, so resistance was light. The regiment captured thousands of Germans in open field fighting while suffering 47 KIA and reached its objective of St. Benoit on 15 September. =Meuse-Argonne= Its final exploits came when the 42nd Division relieved the 1st Infantry Division during the 3rd phase of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Attacking against a well entrenched enemy in terrible terrain without support from units on its flanks, the regiment suffered heavy casualties while moving forward and captured Hill 252 overlooking the Meuse River on 7 November. Once again, it was the tip of the spear of the American First Army. The war ended four days later with the signing of the Armistice, but the 69th then served as occupation troops in Remagen before returning to New York in the spring of 1919. =Return & recognition= thumbleft Colonel Donovan and the Fighting 69th pass under the Victory Arch in New York City in 1919. Upon the return from France, Colonel Donovan remarked that \\"The morale of the regiment has never been better than it is today. Formerly 85 percent of its strength were of Irish descent, and now it is only 50 percent, but the spirit of the old Fighting 69th is stronger than ever. The replacements, whether they are Jews, Italians, or other foreign descent, are more Irish now than the Irish!\\". He also later pointed out that at one point during the Argonne battle, the adjutants of all three battalions were Jews, one lieutenant was born in Germany, and another lieutenant was a full blooded Choctaw from Oklahoma. During World War I, total casualties of the regiment amounted to 644 killed in action and 2,587 wounded (200 of whom would later die of their wounds) during 164 days of front-line combat. One member of the regiment killed in World War I was Daniel Buckley who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. Sixty members earned the Distinguished Service Cross and three of its members were awarded the Medal of Honor, including its famed 1st Battalion and later regimental commander, William Joseph Donovan. Colonel Donovan went on to organize the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II, retiring as a major general. It also produced Father Francis Duffy, \\"The Fighting Chaplain\\". In France, Duffy was always seen in the thick of battle, assisting the litter bearers in recovering the wounded, administering last rites, burying the dead, and encouraging the men, while unarmed, and at great risk to his own life. His bravery and inspired leadership was so great that at one point the brigade commander, Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, even considered making him the regimental commander, an unheard of role for a chaplain. With the New York National Guard federalized during the war, a new state force, the New York Guard, was organized in 1917 in order to have militia troops available if needed by the Governor of New York under the New York State Constitution. As part of this, a replacement 69th Infantry Regiment was created. On 7 January 1921, the 165th Infantry Regiment was consolidated with the 69th Infantry of the New York Guard and reorganized as the 69th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard. World War II 27th Infantry Division shoulder sleeve insignia During World War II, the regiment again served with distinction. Still designated the 165th Infantry, it served with 27th Division (New York State's National Guard Division at the time) and was federalized 15 October 1940. It was first sent to Alabama and Louisiana for training. One week after Pearl Harbor, it was sent to Inglewood, California, to assist in defense of the West Coast. Beginning in January 1942, the regiment made its way to Hawaii via Fort Ord and San Francisco. =Makin Island= Makin Island First assigned to island defense in Kauai, they were recalled to Oahu in October to begin training for the 20 November 1943 landings on Butaritari Island of Makin Atoll, part of the Gilbert Islands. There it was supplemented with artillery and armor to become the 165th Regimental Combat Team. The regiments first and third infantry battalions would land on the western (\\"Red\\") Beach, which was expected to be the most heavily defended, and the second battalion would land on the Northern (\\"Yellow\\") beach to trap the defenders from behind. The Japanese actually kept their forces near the northern beach, so resistance on Red beach was minimal. Despite this, Col Gardiner Conroy, commander of the regiment, was killed there as he directed tanks to support the infantrymen. The second battalion landings were more difficult due to the enemy presence and the need to wade in from 250 yards out, but by noon the beach was secure. On 21 November, the regiment secured Butaritari Village and endured a Banzai charge that night. The regiment continued to sweep across the island and by mid morning on 23 November, the signal \\"Makin Taken\\" was sent. Writer and Army historian S.L.A. Marshall was attached to the 27th Infantry Division for the beachhead assault on Makin Island. He was studying soldiers under combat and followed a battalion on the beach; possibly from the 69th (then 165th). His experience gives insight into the extreme heat and physical exhaustion. He described his experiences: > I followed along for about a hundred yards into the bush. There, after just > a few stumbling steps, I fell apart. My sense reeled. I was hit by such > weakness that I dropped my carbine and could not unbuckle my belt, but that > was not the worst of it. within seconds my nerve had gone completely and I > shook all over from fear. I lay flat under a pandanus tree, telling myself: > 'It's combat fatigue. You've been kidding yourself. You are too old for the > wars.'

The Marines landed on 15 June 1944 but suffered large casualties, so the Fighting 69th was the first army unit ashore when it led the reinforcement landing at 1:17 AM on 17 June. By nightfall, despite heavy opposition, the second battalion reached Aslito Airfield, while the first battalion fought for control of the ridge between the airfield and Cape Obian. The airfield was captured the next day, and the regiment began clearing operations toward Nafutan Point. The regiment was then redeployed to clear out \\"Purple Heart Ridge\\" on 23 June, and accomplished that by the 27th despite heavy flanking fire. It next helped clear Hill Able and Hill King in \\"Death Valley\\" and advanced to Tanapag Harbor on the west coast of the island by 4 July. On 6 July, the assault continued onto Tanapag Plain.http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/smallunit/smallunit-tanapag.htm On 7 July it attacked Makunsha and secured it by 8 July. The island was declared secured on 9 July, although isolated resistance continued for a year. During the months of July and August, the regiment cleaned out isolated pockets in the mountains and cliffs of Saipan. Beginning in the middle of August, the unit moved to the New Hebrides for rest and rehabilitation. On 25 March 1945, the 27th Division sailed from Espiritu Santo, arriving at Okinawa, 9 April 1945. =Okinawa= At Okinawa, landings were made on the west coast in the vicinity of Kadena airfield on 1 April 1945, with the Marine 1st and 6th Divisions sweeping northeast and the Army 7th Division moving south along the eastern coast and the 96th Division moving south down the center of the island. The Fighting 69th as part of the 27th Division again served as a floating reserve. The Marines encountered little resistance and the two Army divisions moved rapidly south until they ran headlong into the previously unknown and very strong Manchinato line on 6 April. When they were repulsed with heavy casualties, the 27th Division was added to their right flank along the west coast to be part of a coordinated assault that began on 19 April. The Fighting 69th formed the right side of the division and corps line along the western coast and fought its way south. The terrain and defense were formidable. Numerous ridges, tunnels and prepared pillboxes were used by the enemy in a tenacious defense. It took heavy and continuous fighting by the two battalions until 26 April to secure the Manchinato Airfield. During this engagement, the actions of F Company in overcoming obstacles while extremely outnumbered and cut-off resulted in a Distinguished Unit Citation and its being written up as a staff study on small unit effectiveness. Sgt. (then Pfc.) Alejandro R. Ruiz was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions while serving with A Company on the ridge. Following the assault and capture of this key defensive line, the exhausted XXIV Army Corps was relieved on 1 May by the two Marine divisions and the 77th and 7th Infantry Divisions for the next assault southward. The 27th Division with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth then assumed the duties of the two Marine Divisions in securing the relatively calmer north end of the island. The enemy fought bitterly on Onnatake Hill from 23 May until 2 June, before losing the strong point. After a mopping-up period, the division left Okinawa, 7 September 1945, moved to Japan and occupation duties in Niigata and Fukushima Prefectures. In all, the regiment suffered 472 killed in action during its service in the Second World War. The Cold War Like most National Guard units, the regiment was not called up for Korea or Vietnam, but continued the traditional National Guard role of assisting in disasters and disturbances at home. Realignments saw it once again returned to the 42nd Rainbow Division in 1947. In the 1960s while playing for the New York Knicks, Cazzie Russell was a member of the regiment and wrote a sports column for the regimental newspaper. In March 1970, the regiment was called to federal service for one week to assist during the federal mail strike as part of Operation Graphic Hand. From 1993 to 1996, the regiment became the 69th Air Defense Artillery Regiment. After protests from the unit and its veterans, it returned to its traditional infantry roots and its original regimental number in 1997. Global War on Terror =Operation Noble Eagle= From its armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street in midtown Manhattan, the 69th was one of the first military units to respond to the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, where it helped to secure Ground Zero. Two members were killed during rescue operations on the morning of 11 September, 1st Lieutenant Gerard Baptiste (FDNY) & Specialist Thomas Jurgens (NYS Courts). Following duty at the WTC, 200 soldiers were mobilized to protect the United States Military Academy, West Point, serving for one year. Numerous other members were on active duty providing protection to nuclear power plants, airports, bridges, tunnels, and trains throughout the New York area as part of Operation Noble Eagle. =Operation Iraqi Freedom= On 15 May 2004, the regiment was federalized for combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom, training at Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Irwin, California, before deploying. The Fighting 69th deployed to Iraq as a battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Slack and Command Sergeant Major George Brett, the first time it had seen overseas combat since World War II. Taji The regiment performed combat patrols in Taji, Radwiniyah, and Baghdad. The regiment helped suppress rocket and mortar attacks upon the Green Zone and Camp Cooke. A local sheik in Taji assumed the 69th's curved Rainbow Division insignia was a Special Forces patch because of their aggressiveness, but Lt. Col. Slack explained to him that it \\"meant they were from New York and eager to avenge the 9/11 attacks\\". Baghdad While in Baghdad, the regiment was responsible for finally securing the infamous \\"Route Irish\\" (the airport road) that linked the \\"Green Zone\\" to BIAP airfield, Camp Victory and the surrounding neighborhoods including al-Ameriyah. 19 members of the regiment were killed in action, and over 78 were wounded in action during \\"Operation Wolfhound\\",'The Fighting 69th' Makes History, Yet Again , http://www.thewildgeese.com.

Citation: When his unit was stopped by a skillfully camouflaged enemy pillbox, he displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty. His squad, suddenly brought under a hail of machinegun fire and a vicious grenade attack, was pinned down. Jumping to his feet, Pfc. Ruiz seized an automatic rifle and lunged through the flying grenades and rifle and automatic fire for the top of the emplacement. When an enemy soldier charged him, his rifle jammed. Undaunted, Pfc. Ruiz whirled on his assailant and clubbed him down. Then he ran back through bullets and grenades, seized more ammunition and another automatic rifle, and again made for the pillbox. Enemy fire now was concentrated on him, but he charged on, miraculously reaching the position, and in plain view he climbed to the top. Leaping from 1 opening to another, he sent burst after burst into the pillbox, killing 12 of the enemy and completely destroying the position. Pfc. Ruiz's heroic conduct, in the face of overwhelming odds, saved the lives of many comrades and eliminated an obstacle that long would have checked his unit's advance. Insignia The regiment's unit insignia depicts both the 1861 regimental dress cap device braced by two Irish Wolfhounds and the red shamrock of the First Division of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the Civil War. These are separated by a rainbow depicting the unit's service as a founding regiment of the 42nd Rainbow Division in World War I. The green background on the insignia is rare; most infantry units have an infantry blue background. The regiment has this because its Civil War regimental colors (flags) were green with the Golden Harp of Ireland. Like all New York National Guard units, the coat of arms has as its crest Henry Hudson's ship Halve Maen. Traditions Many of the 69th's traditions and symbols derive from a time when the regiment was made entirely of Irish-Americans. The regiment's Civil War era battle cry was \\"Faugh a Ballagh,\\" which means \\"Clear the Way\\" in Irish. This is reminiscent of the cry of the Irish Brigade of the French Army in the Battle of Fontenoy. A World War I era battle cry is \\"Garryowen in Glory!\\" Its motto is \\"Gentle when stroked - Fierce when provoked\\" in reference to the Irish Wolfhounds on its crest and dress cap badges of 1861. Though by 2001 the regiment was \\"no more Irish than the Notre Dame football team\\", it retained many of the traditions arising from its Irish heritage. New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue has always been led by the regiment and its Irish Wolfhounds.A Tribute to the \\"Fighting 69th\\", 69th Infantry, New York Army National Guard, The 69th Regiment of New York - 2007 New York City Saint Patrick's Day ParadeOf Pride, Parades and Pooches: Dogs of Fighting 69th a Fixture at NY St. Patrick's Day Parade.

(a.k.a. End of the World) is a 1962 American black-and- white survival science fiction film from American International Pictures, produced by Arnold Houghland and Lou Rusoff, directed by Ray Milland, who also stars with Jean Hagen, Frankie Avalon, Mary Mitchel, and Joan Freeman. The original music score was composed by Les Baxter. The screenplay was written by John Morton and Jay Simms. The film was released by AIP in 1962 as a double feature with Tales of Terror. Plot Harry Baldwin (Ray Milland), his wife Ann (Jean Hagen), their son Rick (Frankie Avalon), and daughter Karen (Mary Mitchell) leave suburban Los Angeles on a camping trip just after sunrise. The Baldwins notice unusually bright light flashes coming from a great distance behind them. Sporadic news reports broadcast on CONELRAD hint at the start of an atomic war, later confirmed when the Baldwins see a large mushroom cloud over what was Los Angeles. The family initially attempts to return to rescue Ann's mother, but they soon abandon the plan as panicked people climb over one another to escape the fallout from multiple nuclear explosions. Witnessing society being torn apart, Harry decides that the family must find refuge at their secluded vacation spot. The Baldwins stop to buy supplies at a small town off the main road, which has not yet been inundated by the crowd fleeing Los Angeles. When Harry attempts buy tools and guns from hardware store owner Ed Johnson (Richard Garland), who believes only Los Angeles has been hit and assumes the government will remain intact, Johnson withholds the guns per state law since Harry can only cover them with checks. With Rick's help, Harry absconds with the weapons, but insists to Johnson that he will eventually return to pay for them in full. On the road, the family encounters three threatening young hoodlums, Carl (Richard Bakalyan), Mickey (Rex Holman), and Andy (Neil Nephew), but manage to drive them off. After a harrowing journey, the Baldwins reach their destination and find shelter in a cave, while they wait for order to be restored. On their portable radio, they listen to war news and learn that what remains of the United Nations has declared this to be \\"Year Zero\\". Harry and Rick soon discover that Ed Johnson and his wife are their neighbors, but not for long: the Johnsons are killed by the three thugs encountered earlier. While doing laundry, Ann drops a blouse in a stream, which draws the attention of the hoodlums. As Karen sits and reads a book, they accost her. Ann scares them off with a rifle and comforts her traumatized daughter. They return to the cave, where it is confirmed that Karen was raped. Upon hearing this, the Baldwin men search for the two rapists, find them at a farm house, and Harry shoots both dead. He and Rick hear a noise and discover a teenage girl, Marilyn (Joan Freeman), kept in a locked room as a sex slave. When questioned, she tells them she lived there with her parents, the Johnsons, before both were murdered by the thugs. Freeing her, Marilyn returns with them to the cave, where Ann cares for her. Some time later, Rick is out with Marilyn chopping wood. Carl, the third hoodlum, sneaks up behind Marilyn, forcing her to drop the rifle she is holding. He questions her about what happened to his brothers. Rick tells him to back off and throws a piece of wood at him, while Marilyn breaks away, grabs the dropped rifle, and shoots Carl dead. In the midst of the struggle, Carl fires a shot, striking Rick in the leg. The family begins a journey to find a doctor Marilyn knows in Paxton, California. On the drive there, they hear \\"the enemy\\" has asked for a truce and that \\"Year Zero\\" is ending. They find Doctor Strong (Willis Bouchey, billed as Willis Buchet), and he does what he can for Rick, who has lost so much blood that he now needs a blood transfusion; he must be taken to an Army hospital more than 100 miles (160 km) away or he will die. Along the way, they encounter an Army military patrol that is reestablishing order. After a tense meeting with both soldiers, they are allowed to continue. Watching them depart, the soldiers note they are among the \\"good ones\\" who escaped radiation sickness by being in the mountains when the atomic bombs exploded. As the family drives on, a closing title card states: \\"There must be no end ‚Äì only a new beginning\\".

Samuel Z. Arkoff of AIP said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because \\"they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction\\". Roger Corman later said about the film, \\"the subject was exciting, but the technicians who worked on the film, who were my technicians, told me that Ray had been somewhat overwhelmed. He wasn‚Äôt organized enough to act and direct at the same time. He lost time on a three-week scene and forgot his scenes\\". Reception Frankie Avalon later said, \\"The film came out to real good reviews\\". American International Pictures sent the star around the country to promote it. He went on to say, \\"We did a tour of theaters in Los Angeles, and it made its money back just in Los Angeles alone\\". This success led to Avalon making a number of films with AIP. =Critical= Michael Atkinson, the film critic for The Village Voice, liked the film and wrote in 2005, \\"This forgotten, saber-toothed 1962 AIP cheapie might be the most expressive on-the-ground nightmare of the Cold War era, providing a template not only for countless social-breakdown genre flicks (most particularly, Michael Haneke's Time of the Wolf) but also for authentic crisis‚Äîshades of New Orleans haunt its DVD margins...the movie is nevertheless an anxious, detail- rich essay on moral collapse\\".Atkinson, Michael.

Glenn Erickson writes, in his DVD Savant review, \\"Panic In Year Zero! scrupulously avoids any scenes requiring more than minimalist production values yet still delivers on its promise, allowing audience imagination to expand upon the narrow scope of what's actually on the screen. It sure seemed shocking in 1962, and easily trumped other more pacifistic efforts. The Day the Earth Caught Fire was for budding flower people; Panic In Year Zero! could have been made as a sales booster for the gun industry\\".Erickson, Glenn.

Orpheus sank off the west coast of Auckland, New Zealand on 7 February 1863: 189 crew out of the ship's complement of 259 died in the disaster, making it the worst maritime tragedy to occur in New Zealand waters.Otago Witness (7 March 1863), p7.  The ship  HMS Orpheus (named after the Greek hero) was a Jason-class corvette, a screw-driven vessel built in Chatham Dockyard in Kent, England, in 1861. She was owned by the Royal Navy, and was 69 metres long with a crew of 259. Orpheus was commanded by Captain Robert Heron Burton. She displayed a broad pennant to indicate that Commodore William Farquharson Burnett, senior officer of HM ships and vessels on the Australian and New Zealand Stations, was also on board. She was wrecked when delivering naval supplies and troop reinforcements to Auckland for the New Zealand Wars.The Daily Southern Cross (9 February 1863)  Background  Orpheus's first journey was in December 1861 flying the pennant of Commodore W Farquharson Burnett CB. She sailed from Plymouth Sound, initially for convoy duty off Canada, which delayed her voyage to Sydney. On 31 January 1863, Burnett set out on a mission to New Zealand. The mission was not to reinforce the British ships already taking part in the New Zealand Wars, but to arrange for the withdrawal of two Royal Navy sloops: Miranda, stationed in Manukau harbour, and Harrier. They were to rendezvous in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour. Orpheus was behind schedule, and Burnett decided to save some time by cutting through Manukau Harbour rather than going by the intended course of rounding North Cape and sailing down the East Coast of Northland.Stone (2007)  The wreck  Whatipu beach: area of the wreck Orpheus left Sydney, Australia, on 31 January 1863. Her approach to Manukau Harbour on 7 February ran near Whatipu beach, through a series of dangerous sand bars. The weather was clear and sunny. Although the bars had been charted twice, in 1836 and 1856, a revised pilotage guide from 1861 was available that indicated that the middle sand bar had moved northwards and grown considerably in the intervening time. Orpheus carried both the out-of-date chart and the updated guide, and the sailing master William Strong originally used the updated instructions for entering the harbour, but he was over-ruled by the commodore and the ship proceeded according to the 1856 chart. As the ship approached the submerged bar, a navigational signal from nearby Paratutae Island was received instructing her to turn north to avoid a grounding. Soon after, Quartermaster Frederick Butler (a convicted deserter, and one of only two men on board to have previously entered Manukau Harbour) alerted the senior officers to the improper course they were taking. Despite finally attempting to correct their course, a few minutes later, at approximately 1:30 in the afternoon, Orpheus hit the bar in an approximate position of .Stone (2007), pp.152‚Äì164. The force of the surf soon caused Orpheus to swing around, exposing its port side to the waves. Considerable damage was sustained: the hatches burst open, cabin windows were shattered, and Orpheus began to take on water. The crew attempted to abandon ship, but the power of the sea's surge made escape extremely difficult, and many sailors were swept away.  The Wonga Wonga  Meanwhile, the harbour pilot and signalman of Manukau Harbour on duty was Edward Wing (son of Captain Thomas Wing, pilot and harbourmaster of the Port of Manukau who also created the original 1836 chart) who was, at that time guiding the steamship Wonga Wonga out of the harbour. When it became apparent that Orpheus was in trouble, Wonga Wonga approached the beached ship and attempted to pick up survivors, many of whom had climbed into the rigging as the deck became submerged. At approximately 8:00pm, the masts began to break, killing most of the crew who remained on board. Wonga Wonga remained in the area overnight looking for survivors, and then buried what dead could be recovered in the sand-dunes on shore. An information board located at Kakamatua Inlet on the WaitƒÅkere Ranges, near Titirangi to the west of Auckland, indicates the approximate area, now heavily overgrown, where some of the victims were buried. Later, the survivors were transferred from Wonga Wonga to HMS Avon and taken to Onehunga.  Aftermath  Three inquiries were held after the shipwreck, but due to the unwillingness of the Royal Navy to admit an officer's culpability much of the blame was laid on Edward Wing for not guiding the ship into the harbour and for failing to maintain the signalling station on Paratutai Island. In all, 189 people died in the wreck of HMS Orpheus, including Commodore Burnett and Captain Burton, giving it the highest ever casualty rate for a shipwreck in New Zealand waters.The emigrant ship Cospatrick involved a greater loss of New Zealand life, but occurred in international waters Later, the survivors (8 officers and 62 men, including Edward Lofley) were taken to HMS Miranda and split into three groups. All the officers and 10 hands were sent to Portsmouth to appear before a court martial (in this case not a criminal trial, but a formal inquiry); 25 sailors were drafted to HMS Harrier; and the remaining 27 sailors stayed with Miranda. Most of the sailors who drowned were very young, some being boys aged 12 to 18 who were still \\"learning the ropes\\" to become able seamen. The average age of the crew (including marines) was only 25. The cause of this disaster is disputed, even after the Admiralty laid the blame on Edward Wing. The local Maori interpreted it differently. In Manukau Harbour some distance from the scene of the disaster lies Puketutu Island. On the extreme western point of the island there grew a puriri tree, the tree was considered sacred and \\"tapu\\" to the Maori people. The day before Orpheus was wrecked a pakeha settler felled the tree and used the wood for fence posts. Hence, Maori linked the disaster with a violation of tapu. Orpheus Island off the coast of Queensland was named after the corvette by Lieutenant G. E. Richards in 1887 in memory of the loss of life.Hetherington, Roy M (1975) The Wreck of HMS Orpheus.

Warneke pitched for the National League in the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933, hitting the first triple and scoring the first National League run in All-Star game history. He pitched in two other All-Star Games (1934, 1936) and was also selected in 1939 and 1941. Warneke pitched in two World Series for the Cubs (1932, 1935), compiling a record of 2‚Äì1, with a 2.63 earned run average (ERA). He pitched a no-hitter for the Cardinals on August 30, 1941; opened the 1934 season with back to back one-hitters (April 17 and 22); and set a Major League Baseball fielding record for pitchers (since eclipsed) of 227 consecutive chances without an error, covering 163 games. After retiring as a player in 1945, Warneke was an umpire in the Pacific Coast League for three years and then in the National League from 1949 to 1955. Warneke is the only person who has both played and umpired in both an All-Star Game and a World Series.Donald Duren, \\"Lon Warneke: the Arkansas hummingbird\\", The Record 33 (1992).  Early years  Lonnie Warneke, which was his baptismal name, was born March 28, 1909, the fourth of five children to Louis W. (\\"Luke\\") Warneke and Martha Belle Scott Warneke in Owley, Arkansas, six miles south of Mount Ida, the county seat of Montgomery County. Mount Ida had a population of 298 in 1920 and 512 in 1930. Luke Warneke (who stood ) had homesteaded 160 acres and was a successful farmer in the farming community of Owley, which consisted of fifteen families.Montgomery County: Our heritage, 1 (1986). Montgomery County was one of the most rural and sparsely populated counties of Arkansas; by 1910 its population had peaked at 12,455. At the time of Lon Warneke's birth the county had no paved roads, no electricity, and no running water. Luke Warneke, from 1907 to 1913, was in charge of improving the county roads and, using the newly acquired road graders drawn by eight mules, he made major improvements to the roads throughout the county, transforming them from dirt trails often overgrown by brush, pocketed by mud holes, and punctured by tree stumps, to passable, graded two-lane (wagon) roads‚Äîalthough still unpaved. Electricity and running water would not come to most of the county until the 1930s. Young Lonnie Warneke attended grade school in the one- room schoolhouse in Owley. He soon grew to be among the tallest students in the tiny school. He helped his father on the farm and did chores for his mother. In his free time, he enjoyed the outdoors, hunted and fished; he also played the guitar and fiddle‚Äîpursuits that would occupy him his entire life. \\"Lonnie Warneke is a country boy. He loves hunting dogs and good guns, the trails and loneliness of the wilderness in the rugged mountains surrounding his old home.\\" Even after he became a professional ballplayer, he would return to the country and enjoy the outdoors‚Äîas well as play in ballgames with the locals. Because the school in Owley went only through \\"middle school\\" years, Warneke attended the nearest high school, that in Mount Ida. Because of his stature, Warneke played first base for the high school team.Lonnie Warneke, \\"How I got my start in baseball\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, May 3, 1932, as told to Irving Vaughan. In his final year he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher: Warneke faced a semi-professional team and struck out five of six batters he faced. Warneke also played for the Mount Ida Athletics, a squad that played Montgomery County area teams.  Minor league career (1928‚Äì30)  After high school Warneke moved to Houston, Texas, where his older sister, Kate, and her husband lived. Warneke got a job delivering telegrams by bicycle for Western Union. In Spring 1928, Warneke approached the president of the Houston Buffaloes, a Texas League baseball team in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, and asked for a tryout as a first baseman. Rebuffed at first, Warneke offered to pay his own way to training camp. At camp, Buffaloes manager Frank \\"Pancho\\" Snyder (former catcher for the Cardinals and New York Giants) took a look at Warneke and told the nineteen-year-old that he had the arm of a pitcher. After Snyder's evaluation, Warneke was sent off to pitch for the Laurel Cardinals of the Cotton States League. Warneke impressed no one at Laurel and the Cardinals released him. Due to Warneke's ensuing major league success, the St. Louis Cardinals later instituted a policy such that \\"any decision to release a player who possesse[s] even one major-league skill (speed, arm, defense, hitting, power) must be made by more than one person\\" of their organization.Jerome M. Mileur, High-flying birds: the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals, University of Missouri Press, 2009, p. 246, note 10. Warneke completed the year with another team in the Cotton States League, the Alexandria Reds, a team affiliated with Shreveport of the Texas League. One of Warneke's teammates on Alexandria was Ray Prim, with whom he would pitch for the Cubs in 1943 and 1945. As a converted pitcher in his first professional season, Warneke posted a 1928 combined record for Laurel and Alexandria of 6 wins, 14 losses, with a 5.32 ERA in 176 innings pitched. Warneke returned to Alexandria for the 1929 season and posted a 16‚Äì10 record, with a 3.09 ERA in 245 innings pitched. Alexandria finished first under manager Pete Kilduff. Warneke's success attracted the Chicago Cubs, that year's National League pennant winner. On August 23, just before the Cotton States season closed, the Associated Press carried a story announcing that Warneke had been sold to the Cubs \\"for $10,000 or more\\", the highest price ever paid for a Cotton States League player. The sale was initially denied by the Shreveport organization but then confirmed by telegraph to the Alexandria Daily Town Talk a few days later by Kilduff, although he stated the sales price of Warneke was $7,500. Whatever the figure, Lonnie \\"Country\\" Warneke reported to the Chicago Cubs spring training facilities on Santa Catalina Island, California in late- February 1930, a month before his twenty-first birthday. Warneke was at once involved in an on-field accident that sent him to the hospital. On February 24, while pitchers were taking batting practice, fellow rookie Bill McAfee, fresh out of the University of Michigan, was taking swings and lost his grip on his bat, sending it hurtling against the forehead of Warneke, who was standing near the batting cage. Warneke slumped to the ground but suffered no serious damage, although he did have to report to the hospital and receive a couple stitches.\\"Cub player is injured: Warneke hit on forehead by flying bat during practice\\", The New York Times, February 25, 1930; Irving Vaughan, \\"Gabby Hartnett gives arm first test of the season\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, February 25, 1930, p. 19. Warneke made the regular season roster for the Cubs, although he appeared in only one game before being assigned to the Cubs Class- AA affiliate Reading Keystones on May 23. A week later Warneke pitched a complete game 6‚Äì2 victory over Newark, allowing eight hits and striking out five. Yet success largely escaped Warneke that year, as he compiled a 9‚Äì12 win-loss record with a 6.03 ERA. He allowed 236 hits in 185 innings for Reading, which finished under .500. Despite such numbers, Warneke would never appear in another minor league game; instead he played at the major league level for the next fourteen years. Among his teammates on Reading was infielder Billy Jurges, who would play in the major leagues for seventeen years, including six seasons (1931‚Äì36) with Warneke as a Cub.  Major league career  = Chicago Cubs (1930‚Äì36) =  1930 and 1931  First major league appearance Lon Warneke appeared in one major league game for the Cubs in 1930. His major league debut was on the fourth day of the season, Friday, April 18, at Sportsman's Park, St. Louis versus the Cardinals with 6000 in attendance. The twenty-one-year-old Warneke took the mound in the bottom of the sixth in relief of Guy Bush, with the Cardinals ahead 5‚Äì0. Warneke promptly doubled the Cubs' deficit. He worked the sixth inning and gave up one run. In the seventh he recorded one out and gave up another four runs before being pulled for fellow rookie Lynn Nelson. In all, Warneke faced eleven batters, walked five of them, surrendered two hits and allowed five earned runs and a wild pitch in 1 1/3 innings. The final score of the game was 11‚Äì1; the winning pitcher was Bill (\\"Wild Bill\\") Hallahan. Warneke would not pitch again in the majors until exactly one year later. The defending National League Champion Cubs finished in second place, two games behind the Cardinals in 1930. Rogers Hornsby, future Hall of Famer, took over managing the Cubs from Joe McCarthy with four games left in the 1930 season. Hornsby continued as player-manager for the Cubs throughout 1931 and the first ninety-nine games of 1932. Warneke's second major league game was a year to the date after his first. It was also his first major league loss. This time he took the mound on the fifth day of the season, Saturday, April 18, 1931, before 30,000 at Wrigley Field in Chicago versus the visiting Cardinals. The Cubs had rallied for two runs in the ninth to tie the score 5‚Äì5 and, having used eight pitchers in the first four games of the season and another two in this game, sent Warneke out in the top of the tenth. He again showed signs of wildness, walking three of six batters faced, allowing a hit and two earned runs, and lasting two thirds of the inning before getting pulled. The Cubs could not make up the deficit and lost 7‚Äì5, with Bill (\\"Wild Bill\\") Hallahan once again recording the win‚Äîand Warneke the loss. In two games, a year apart, Warneke's major league record was 0‚Äì1, 2 innings pitched, allowing seven earned runs on three hits and eight walks, for an ERA of 31.50 and a WHIP of 5.50. Although Warneke was not sent down to the minors, and never saw minor league service again in his career, he didn't pitch again for the Cubs for two months. On June 18 Warneke pitched a scoreless inning of relief in a game at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Dodgers. He fanned two batters, which strike outs were the first two of 1140 in his career. Warneke's performance earned him the first start of his career, three days later, on Sunday, June 21 in the series closer against Brooklyn. With 15,000 in attendance, Warneke pitched seven innings, allowing six earned runs on nine hits and five walks, with one hit batsman. He allowed his only home run of the season to the Dodgers' cleanup hitter, Del Bissonette, and departed the game after seven with the Cubs down 6‚Äì3. Chicago rallied for three in the top of the ninth, thus removing Warneke as the pitcher of record. The Dodgers scored one in the ninth to win the game. Warneke lost his next two starts, versus the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies, before recording his first major league win. On Wednesday, August 5, Warneke pitched a complete game victory at Wrigley Field against the Cincinnati Reds for the first of 192 career victories and 192 career complete games. Warneke faced 37 batters, allowing 2 earned runs on 8 hits (all singles) and two walks, while striking out 3, winning 3‚Äì2. Warneke doubled to drive in the first run of his career. The Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"Of great importance in yesterday's game was Lon Warneke, another of the [player-manager, Rogers] Hornsby debutants who may be heard from in the future. The slat-like lad threw so skillfully that...the Reds were confined to eight hits.\\"Irving Vaughan, \\"Cubs whip Reds, 3‚Äì2, on Barton's hit in 9th\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, August 6, 1931, p. 19. Warneke started three more games in 1931, two of them complete games. For the year, Warneke finished 2‚Äì4 with a 3.22 ERA in twenty games, including seven starts. In 64 1/3 innings pitched he allowed 67 hits and 37 walks while striking out 27. The Cubs ended the year 84‚Äì70 in third place, 17 games behind the repeat league champion Cardinals. Between 1903 and 1942 the Cubs and Chicago White Sox would almost annually face off in a post-season \\"City Series\\" when neither team was playing in the World Series.Frederick Ivor-Campbell, \\"City Series,\\", Retrosheet. (Re-printed from Total Baseball, 1989.) Retrieved July 23, 2011 The series was officially sanctioned by Major League Baseball beginning in 1905. Although official rules and league umpires were used, results and statistics, just as those for the World Series, were not added to regular season totals. Other such \\"city series\\" were played elsewhere, such as in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Ohio. The 1931 Chicago City Series was played on seven consecutive days from Wednesday, September 30 to Tuesday, October 6. Warneke played in Game 1 of the 1931 Chicago City Series, in which 43-year-old Urban (Red) Faber of the White Sox shut out the Cubs 9‚Äì0 at Wrigley Field before a crowd of 15,000. Warneke came on in the seventh inning, faced six batters, allowed one hit and one walk, no runs. After the 1931 season, Warneke returned home to the family farm in Owley and invested part of his summer pay in 200 feeder cattle at $2.00 a head. Soon after fattening his herd, the cattle market bottomed out. Warneke remarked that he would \\"keep 'em as pets.\\"See also Irving Vaughan, \\"Cubs unveil a musician on way west\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, February 15, 1932, p. 17. Vaughan quotes Warneke as saying: \\"I haven't been able to sell any, but I can feed 'em for a year on $35 and at that rate I can keep 'em for pets.\\"  1932  In 1932, Cubs manager, Rogers Hornsby credited veteran backup catcher Zack Taylor with helping correct a flaw in Warneke's pitching delivery. Instead of looking at the plate when he threw, he looked down at his feet. Taylor corrected the error and Warneke gained more control over his blazing fastball and hard-breaking curveball. Warneke mused that he would win \\"about a half dozen games\\" during the regular season. Instead, Warneke led the National League in wins (22), earned run average (2.37), shutouts (4), and winning percentage (.786), leading the Cubs to the National League Pennant and placing second in Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting. Warneke rose to the top of a pitching staff that included Guy Bush (19-11), Charlie Root (15-10), and Pat Malone, another 15-game winner. Offensive stars included Gabby Hartnett, Charlie Grimm, Riggs Stephenson, Billy Herman. Warneke opened the season with five straight complete game victories, helping the Cubs to a 17‚Äì6 first-place start to the season. From mid-June to late July, Warneke ran off a nine-game winning streak, all complete games, in a span of 44 Cubs games in which the rest of the pitching staff went 14‚Äì21. On August 4, The Sporting News reported on its front page: \\"Warneke...is the sensation of the outfit, and there is as yet no indication that he is going to slow down.\\"Irving Vaughan, \\"Warneke hurling only balm for Chicago Cubs, The Sporting News, August 4, 1932, p. 1. That same day first baseman Charlie Grimm took over as the Cubs' manager, replacing player-manager Rogers Hornsby, whose record was 53‚Äì46; the Cubs were in second place, five games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 11, Warneke started, but did not win, a 3‚Äì2 extra inning victory in which the Cubs leapfrogged over the Pirates into first place, where they remained for the last 47 games of the season. The Cubs finished 37‚Äì18 under Grimm. Warneke went 5‚Äì1 with two shut outs and four no decisions down the stretch.  1932 World Series  The Cubs' World Series opponent were the New York Yankees, who finished 107‚Äì47, outscoring their opponents 1002-724. Led by sluggers Babe Ruth (.341-41-137), Lou Gehrig (.349-34-151), Tony Lazzeri (.300-15-113), Bill Dickey (.310-15-84), and Ben Chapman (.299-10-107), the team was never shut out all season. The pitching staff included Lefty Gomez (24-7), Red Ruffing (18-7), George Pipgras (16-9), and Johnny Allen (17-4). The Cubs' scored 720 runs (fourth in the N.L.) and were shut out eight times. Only three Cub's batters drove in more than 65 runs: Stephenson, 85; Grimm, 80; Kiki Cuyler, 77. Both teams led their leagues in ERA: the Yankees, 3.98 and the Cubs, 3.44. The Yankees swept the Cubs in the World Series. Warneke started and lost Game 2, 5‚Äì2, before 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium in New York. Nevertheless, he was the Cubs' most effective starter during the series, throwing Chicago's only complete game, in which he scattered ten hits, all singles. Warneke suffered early game jitters, walking the first two batters he faced (both scored) before striking out Babe Ruth. Warneke allowed two more runs in the third and another in the fifth. He retired the side in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, facing the minimum nine batters. He struck out seven Yankees in the game and eight in the Series, the most by any Cubs' starter and twice as many as any other Cubs' pitcher. On just two days rest, with the Cubs down three games to none, Warneke was called upon to relieve in the first inning of Game 4; he departed in the fourth inning with the Cubs ahead.  1932 Accolades  Major American newspapers of the day called Warneke the outstanding National League pitcher of the 1932 season\\"Warneke outstanding pitcher for National League in 1932\\", New York Times, December 29, 1932; Edward Burns, \\"1932 averages prove Warneke best pitcher\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, December 29, 1932, p. 13. and The Sporting News (which had hailed Warneke as \\"a great pitcher, such as pops up once in a lifetime\\") named him as one of two pitchers to its 1932 All-Star team,Patrick Mondout, \\"The Sporting News All-Stars\\", Baseball Chronology.

The trade was not popular with many Cub fansJohn Miskell, \\"Lon Warneke\\", Montgomery County: Our heritage, 1 (1986), p. 252. and may have cost the Cubs the pennant.Al Yellon, \\"The Top 100 Cubs Of All Time ‚Äì #50 Lon Warneke\\", Bleed Cubbie Blue, December 31, 2006. Archived from the original on July 21, 2011. Cub's Gabby Hartnett, player- manager from 1938 to 1940, said \\"That trade hurt us. It probably cost us the pennant in '37.\\" Without Warneke the Cubs finished 93‚Äì61, in second place, three games behind the New York Giants. Meanwhile, Warneke led the Cardinals staff with an 18‚Äì11 record. Parmelee went 7‚Äì8 for the Cubs and was sold the following year; Collins lasted two seasons with the Cubs. Warneke won 83 games for the Cardinals during his five and a half seasons in St. Louis. In 1937, Warneke led the Cardinals' staff with an 18‚Äì11 record. This was the only season in which Warneke and fellow Arkansas phenom pitcher Dizzy Dean were on the same team. With the Cardinals, Warneke played guitar and banjo and sang as a member of teammate John \\"Pepper\\" Martin's \\"Mississippi Mudcats\\" band.Robert Creamer, \\"Mudcats in the Gashouse\\", Sports Illustrated 6(16) (April 22, 1957), p. 28. = Chicago Cubs 1942‚Äì43 and 1945 = On July 8, 1942, two days after the All-Star Game, the Chicago Cubs purchased Warneke's contract for $7,500.Edward Burns, \\"Lon Warneke's a Cub again; reports today\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, July 9, 1942, p. 19. Note both Duren, \\"Lon Warneke\\", p, 19 and the Chicago Tribune list the figure as $7,500, which is what the Tribune says was the \\"waiver price\\" of the day. Retrosheet and Baseball Reference (based on Retrosheet) list a figure of $75,000. Through the remainder of the 1942 season, Warneke had 15 appearances (12 of them starts) with the Cubs, compiling a 5‚Äì7 record. In 1943, he made 21 appearances (10 of them starts), and had a 4‚Äì5 record. Warneke was notified that he passed his military pre- induction physical on March 28, 1944, his 35th birthday. He had previously announced that he was ready \\"to toss hand grenades at Hitler and Hirohito.\\" As a civilian director, Warneke was put in charge of recreation at the Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot near Camden, Arkansas, where he organized, managed, and pitched in a baseball league comprising teams from nearby cities, colleges, and military facilities. Many civilians worked in supporting positions during World War II, and Warneke's role was consistent with President Roosevelt's 1942 statement that baseball was a morale booster. Warneke rejoined the Cubs in June 1945, but pitched in only nine games in his final season as a player, compiling an 0‚Äì1 record. Although the Cubs won the pennant, Warneke did not appear in the 1945 World Series. Umpiring career Warneke as an NL umpire, c. 1955 Warneke first umpired a major league game in 1940, under unusual circumstances. A game on April 23 between the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals had been postponed, and when it was about to be played at Crosley Field on May 13, it was found that no umpires had been assigned by the National League. Umpire Larry Goetz, who lived in Cincinnati, was summoned to the ballpark and served as home plate umpire. Reds' coach Jimmie Wilson umpired at first base, and Warneke umpired at third base. The game ended as an 8‚Äì8 tie after 14 innings, called due to darkness. After his playing career ended, Warneke umpired in the Pacific Coast League for the 1946, 1947, and 1948 seasons. In 1949, he became a National League umpire, working that season on a three-man umpiring crew with Jocko Conlan and Bill Stewart. Warneke umpired through the 1955 season, working a total of 1055 games while making 44 ejections.

Gomes da Costa had a distinguished military career in the country's colonies, from 1893 to 1915, in India, Mozambique, Angola, and S√£o Tom√©, having served under the command of Mouzinho de Albuquerque. After World War I, in which he rose to greater prominence in the command of the 1st Division of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps, he became actively engaged in politics, in staunch opposition to the dominant Democratic Party. In 1926, he was involved in the military and political movement that resulted in the 28 May 1926 coup d'√©tat that inaugurated a new conservative, authoritarian regime. Following the military coup, Gomes da Costa deposed moderate Jos√© Mendes Cabe√ßadas, who had received executive and presidential power from the removed Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Maria da Silva and President Bernardino Machado, briefly holding the headship of government and of state in the summer of that year, until he was himself removed by another coup, to be replaced by √ìscar Carmona. Early life Gomes da Costa was born to Carlos Dias da Costa and Madalena de Oliveira; he grew up with two younger siblings, Lucr√©cia and Am√°lia. He began his military career at the Col√©gio Militar at age 10. Tamagnini and Gomes da Costa, together with General Haking.  Military career As a soldier, he stood out in colonial campaigns in the African and Indian colonies. After Portugal had entered the First World War (See: Portugal in the Great War) on the Allied side in early 1917, he commanded the Second Division of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. During the Battle of the Lys on 9 April 1918, the CEP lost 400 dead and around 6,500 prisoners, a third of its forces in the front line. Gomes da Costa's division was hit particularly hard and was all but wiped out. For his command in the war, he was made a general and a Grand Officer of the Military Order of Avis.Gomes da Costa in Artigos de apoio Infop√©dia [em linha]. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003-2016. Accessed 28 December 2016. Two years later, on 5 October 1921, he received the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Avis.Presid√™ncia da Rep√∫blica Portuguesa. Accessed November 28, 2014. Gomes da Costa and his troops march victorious into Lisbon on 6 June 1926. Revolution A convinced monarchist, Gomes da Costa had consorted with people of various political convictions. That, and his reputation as a soldier, led to his choice by right-wing revolutionaries to lead the 28 May 1926 coup d'√©tat in Braga that overthrew the Portuguese First Republic, after General Alves Ro√ßadas, their original choice, had died. After the success of the revolution he did not assume power at first, entrusting the posts of President of the Republic and President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) to Jos√© Mendes Cabe√ßadas, the leader of the revolution in Lisbon. Soon the coup leaders disliked the attitude of Mendes Cabe√ßadas, a choice of the previous president Bernardino Machado and still sympathetic towards the old republic.Filipe Ribeiro de Meneses (2016). Salazar. A Political Biography. New York: Enigma Books, p. 31. He was replaced by Gomes da Costa in both posts in a meeting in Sacav√©m on 17 June 1926. The new government was the first to include the later prime minister and dictator of Portugal, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, as finance minister. Overthrow and exile Gomes da Costa's government lasted about as long as Cabe√ßadas', because it was overthrown by a new coup on 9 July the same year. This attempt was initiated by Jo√£o Jos√© Sinel de Cordes and √ìscar Carmona, after Gomes da Costa attempted to have Carmona removed as minister for foreign affairs.Filipe Ribeiro de Meneses (2016). Salazar. A Political Biography. New York: Enigma Books, pp. 31-32. Gomes da Costa had no desire to institute a long-term military regime, which brought him into conflict with Carmona and others in the most conservative and authoritarian faction of the military leadership. Carmona, the new President of the Republic and of the Council of Ministers, used the pretext that Gomes da Costa was \\"unfit for office\\" and had him sent to exile in the Azores Islands. However, he also made him a Marshal of the Portuguese Army.Gomes da Costa in Artigos de apoio Infop√©dia [em linha]. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003-2016. Accessed 28 December 2016. In September 1927, he returned to mainland Portugal, already very ill; he died a few months later.

It is used in the treatment of psoriasis. It is safe for long-term application in psoriatic skin conditions. It was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is marketed under the trade name \\"Dovonex\\" in the United States, \\"Daivonex\\" outside North America, and \\"Psorcutan\\" in Germany. Medical uses Chronic plaque psoriasis is the chief medical use of calcipotriol. It has also been used successfully in the treatment of alopecia areata. Contraindications Hypersensitivity, use on face, hypercalcaemia, or evidence of vitamin D toxicity are the only contraindications for calcipotriol use. Cautions include exposure to excessive natural or artificial light, due to the potential for calcipotriol to cause photosensitivity. Adverse effects Adverse effects by frequency: ;Very common (> 10% frequency): * Burning * Itchiness * Skin irritation ;Common (1‚Äì10% frequency): * Dermatitis * Dry skin * Erythema * Peeling * Worsening of psoriasis including facial/scalp * Rash ;Uncommon (0.1‚Äì1% frequency): * Exacerbation of psoriasis ;Rare (< 0.1% frequency): * Allergic contact dermatitis * Hypercalcaemia * Photosensitivity * Changes in pigmentation * Skin atrophy  Interactions  No drug interactions are known. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= The efficacy of calcipotriol in the treatment of psoriasis was first noticed by the observation of patients receiving various forms of vitamin D in an osteoporosis study. Unexpectedly, some patients who also suffered from psoriasis experienced dramatic reductions in lesion counts. The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well understood. However, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), while being less than 1% as active as the calcitriol in regulating calcium metabolism. The vitamin D receptor belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kidney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis, and it is thought that the binding of calcipotriol to the VDR modulates the T cells gene transcription of cell differentiation and proliferation related genes. In mouse studies, topical calcipotriol administration to the ear and dorsal skin led to a dose-dependent increase in the production of the epithelial cell-derived cytokine TSLP by keratinocytes, and triggered atopic dermatitis at high concentrations. This upregulation of TSLP production due to calcipotriol application is thought to be mediated through the coactivation of vitamin D receptor/RXRŒ± and vitamin D receptor/RXRŒ≤ heterodimers. As psoriasis is typically thought to be partially driven by Th1/Th17 inflammatory cytokines, calcipotriol treatment at appropriate concentrations may alleviate psoriasis symptoms by repressing Th1/Th17 inflammation through TSLP production, which is linked to a Th2 response. However, it is important to note that this has not yet been confirmed. =Pharmacokinetics= After application and systemic uptake, calcipotriol undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism. Calcipotriol is metabolized to MC1046 (the Œ±,Œ≤‚àíunsaturated ketone analog), which is subsequently metabolized to its primary metabolite, the saturated ketone analog MC1080. MC1080 is then slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid. The metabolites of calcipotriol are less potent than the parent compound. Chemistry Calcipotriol is a white to almost white crystalline compound.

Biography Fuller was born in England on 7 March 1915, the posthumous and only child of an Indian Army officer. Brought up to think for herself by her mother, who was an artist, and a grandfather who was a retired Army doctor she early developed a wide field of interests. Following a short-lived career as a repertory actress she studied phonetics, linguistics and astronomy, and graduated with honours from the University of London. In the 1930s she became a member of the poetry circle of Victor Benjamin Neuburg, whose biography she wrote.The Magical Dilemma of Victor Neuburg. Jean Overton Fuller (W. H. Allen, 1965) Fuller was a friend of the Inayat Khan family. During the Second World War, she was employed by the British Postal Censorship Office in London. At the end of hostilities, she travelled extensively throughout Europe, interviewing various people connected with Noor's life. The resultant publication, Madeleine, published by Victor Gollancz Ltd. in 1952, was re-published in 1988 by East-West Publications in Rotterdam. This updated version contains some chapters that were removed from the original manuscript, such as an in-depth exploration of Tipu Sultan, Noor's ancestor. Following the book's publication, Fuller continued extensive research into the history of the wartime SOE French networks, interviewing many of the people involved ‚Äì British and French, as well as Germans ‚Äì in order to discover who was responsible for betraying Noor and her fellow agents. Her results were published in the 1958 book Double Webs (Putnam & Co). Until the publication of Shrabani Basu's Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan (Sutton Publishing, 2006), Fuller's book was considered to be the definitive biography of Noor Inayat Khan. Fuller also wrote several other biographies, notably of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Sir Francis Bacon, Victor Neuburg and a book detailing her theory of Jack the Ripper's true identity as Walter Richard Sickert, an English painter. Jean Overton Fuller's memoirs were published in 2007 by Michael Russell, Wilby, Norwich under the title Driven To It, An Autobiography. She died in Kettering on 8 April 2009 at the age of 94.

He played from 1912 to 1932. Torriente was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Cuban League career 1919-1920 Club Almendares A native of Cienfuegos, Cuba, Torriente played in his homeland from 1913‚Äì1927 and holds the record for the highest career batting average in Cuban winter league history (.352). He earned two batting titles and hit as high as .402. In 1920, his team, Almendares, played a nine-game series against the New York Giants. The Giants added Babe Ruth for this tour of Cuba. Torriente outhit Ruth in most categories and Almendares beat the Giants, five games to four. Along with Mart√≠n Dihigo and Jos√© M√©ndez, Torriente is considered one of the greatest baseball players from Cuba. He was one of the first class of inductees of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Negro league career Torriente played much of the summer of 1915 and 1916 for the \\"Western\\" Cuban Stars team until an argument arose with the St. Louis manager in 1916. He tracked down former teammate and friend Jos√© M√©ndez and was hired by J. L. Wilkinson to play for his All Nations just before a big series with C. I. Taylor's Indianapolis ABCs and Rube Foster's Chicago American Giants. Torriente would play several years for both teams. 1919 Chicago American Giants Torriente played on the great Chicago American Giants teams of 1918‚Äì1925. Torriente led the American Giants to Negro National League pennants from 1920 to 1922 while batting .411, .338, and .342 for these seasons. He won the batting title in 1920 and in 1923 with a .412 average. Torriente was traded to the Kansas City Monarchs in 1926 and led the team with a .381 batting average. He retired from the Negro leagues with a career .331 average. Torriente was primarily a pull hitter, though he could hit with power to all fields. He had a stocky and slightly bowlegged build, but was known for deceptive power and a strong, accurate arm from center field. Indianapolis ABC's manager C.I. Taylor stated, \\"If I see Torriente walking up the other side of the street, I would say, 'There walks a ballclub.'\\" In the 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Torriente as the 67th greatest baseball player ever. Torriente was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Personal life Torriente was notorious for his love of the night life and this caused him disputes with team management throughout his career. Torriente was sent to the bench in front of 8,000 spectators in 1915 after he \\"kicked to an Umpire.\\" He put on his street clothes and sat on the bench, then Umpire Goekle sent him to the bleachers, and sent an officer of the law after him.\\"The Cuban Stars Take Series From American Giants.\\" Indianapolis Freeman, Saturday July 17, 1915, Page 4, Columns 4 to 6 Again on August 23, 1915, Torriente kicked Umpire Kelly after Kelly called him out when Torriente attempted to steal third base. A fight with Crawford during the game spilled out onto the street after the game, and the two men attacked each other with paving stones left out when street workers were repairing a water main. Rube Foster broke up the fight.\\"Monday's Game\\" Indianapolis Freeman, Indianapolis, Indiana, Saturday, August 28, 1915, Page 4, Column 4 In 1923, he was sent out of the game in the third inning after objecting to Umpire Gholson's call at second base. He reportedly used \\"awful\\" language, then threw dirt on the Umpire's \\"newly creased trousers.\\" His temper caused him to walk off the Monarchs in 1926 after a dispute involving a stolen diamond ring. In 1918, 24 year-old Torriente registered with the WWI draft. He lists his current occupation as \\"Not Working\\" and currently living at 3448 Wabash Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. He lists himself as a Cuban citizen and his closest living relative as his mother, Mrs. Felipa Torriente of Havana, Cuba.\\"WWI Draft Registration Card for Crist√≥bal Torriente\\" Local Board Division 4, Chicago, Illinois, September 12, 1918 After baseball, Torriente lived for a short time in Ybor City, Florida and faded into obscurity.

At the age of 16 he saw active service when his regiment was sent to Sicily at the height of the Napoleonic Wars. He was part of the successful campaign at Calabria, followed by the unsuccessful Alexandria expedition of 1807, where Gregory was severely wounded. In April 1807 he was sent back to England to recover, then rejoined his battalion for the successful invasion of Java. In Java, Gregory, by then a lieutenant, began suffering from ill health. He was posted to Fort George, Scotland, but his health continued to deteriorate, and in 1818 he was forced to retire on half-pay. On 14 June 1812, while stationed at Fort George, Joshua Gregory married Frances Churchman. By 1825 they had five surviving children, and Gregory had difficulty supporting his family on his pension. In 1829, the Gregory family emigrated to Western Australia, arriving on the Lotus four months after the establishment of the Swan River Colony. He was initially granted land on the left bank of the Swan River, but the soil was poor, and he later obtained other grants at Maylands and in the Upper Swan district. He was later appointed a Justice of the Peace. On 20 August 1838, he died after a long illness.

It was initially released for the Neo Geo arcade platform.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the original Puzzle de Pon! The game plays similarly to the Puzzle Bobble series. There are some gameplay differences however. Although the player clears the colored balls on the screen by firing balls against other balls of the same colour, the objective of the game is not to clear the screen of balls. It is instead to clear all the balls from around the level shape, referred to as the \\"drop token\\". Once this shape is freed, it explodes and the player travels onto the next level. There are 39 levels in the game, divided in groups of three levels. In the first two levels, the shape is something generic; in the third level the shape is a Zodiac sign, up to level 36 (since there are 12 signs). Level 39's shape is the Solar Symbol. Once you beat the game, it is stated that you became the Sun God, and the ending shows your character riding the Sun Chariot in the sky. Levels in this style were later adopted by the Puzzle Bobble series. Puzzle De Pon R! In 1997, a sequel to Puzzle De Pon! was released for the Neo Geo MVS system, entitled Puzzle De Pon! R!.

He is also known for his 10-year run as an NFL play-by-play announcer on ESPN's Monday Night Football from 2006 to 2015. During his 25 year tenure with ESPN, Tirico also called a multitude of sports for the network, including the NBA, college football and basketball, golf, tennis, hockey and world cup soccer. He is known for his two decade run at ABC and its division ABC Sports. Tirico left ESPN when his contract expired in the summer of 2016, and was subsequently hired by NBC Sports. Tirico debuted during NBC's coverage of the 2016 Open Championship and has since served as the network's lead host for golf coverage. Since joining NBC Sports, Tirico has become lead primetime host of the Olympics on NBC,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/sports/mike-tirico-olympics-nbc-korea- race.html lead play-by-play for Notre Dame Football on NBC,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-mike-tirico-notre-dame- nbc-20170814-story.html host of Triple Crown races on NBC,http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2017/04/25/mike-tirico-succeeds-tom- hammond-as-a-host-of-nbc-sports-groups-triple-crown-horse-racing-coverage- beginning-with-2017-kentucky-derby/ host of NBC's Football Night in America,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/08/20/mike-tirico- taking-over-as-host-of-sunday-night-football/37544317/ host of NBC's coverage of the Indianapolis 500https://www.1075thefan.com/news/indycar/mike-tirico- officially-announced-host-nbcs-indy-500-coverage and hosted NBC's coverage of the Stanley Cup.http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/bio/mike-tirico/ Career =ABC and ESPN (1991‚Äì2016)= Tirico joined ESPN in 1991 as a SportsCenter anchor, after four years as Sports Director at CBS affiliate WTVH in Syracuse, New York, during his undergraduate years at Syracuse University. Tirico was noted for his versatile nature and the variety of assignments he handled for SportsCenter. Tirico was the first host seen on ESPNews. Tirico handled the play-by-play for ESPN's Thursday night college football package (1997 to 2005), college basketball coverage (1997 to 2002), NBA coverage (2002 to 2016), and golf coverage for ESPN/ABC (1997 to 2015). Tirico also hosted studio coverage of various ESPN and ABC covered events, including a stint on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown (previously known as NFL Prime Monday) from 1993 to 2001 and ABC's NBA studio shows. He also broadcast NBA games on ESPN/ABC and play-by-play for the NBA Finals on ESPN Radio. He anchored the 2009 U.S. Open (tennis) and co-anchored the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2016 (his last assignment at ESPN/ABC). =NBC Sports (2016‚Äìpresent)= On May 9, 2016, after a leak the prior month, it was officially announced that Mike Tirico would join NBC Sports effective July 1, 2016. Tirico signed off for the last time on ESPN on June 30, 2016, during the conclusion of that day's coverage of the UEFA Euro 2016 soccer tournament. Tirico's first on-air appearance on an NBC property came during the 2016 Open Championship on NBC's Golf Channel, calling play-by-play for the first three hours of first and second round coverage. Tirico moved to the studio host role in the afternoons on both Thursday and Friday, and he hosted all on the coverage on NBC proper over the weekend. Tirico served as a studio host and contributor for NBC's broadcasts of the 2016 Summer Olympics from Rio de Janeiro in August. Richard Deitsch of Sports Illustrated suggested that Tirico could potentially succeed Bob Costas as the primetime host of NBC's Olympics coverage. NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus explained following the 2014 Winter Olympics that the division had begun to \\"think about what life after Bob might be, whether post-Rio, post-Pyeongchang, post-Tokyo, whenever he does not want to do it anymore.\\" Deitsch also felt that Tirico's experience in radio could allow him to contribute to the NBC Sports Radio network. Sports Business Journal initially reported that Tirico would serve as NBC's lead play-by-play announcer for Thursday Night Football (which was expanding to NBC during the upcoming season), and was likely to be a future successor to Al Michaels. The NFL later stated that its contract with NBC required that the network use its lead play-by-play commentator for all primetime broadcasts. In the meantime, Tirico called the two preseason games allocated to NBC, and was placed on play-by-play for NBC's first three Notre Dame college football games to fill in for Dan Hicks, due to Hicks' conflicts with his lead play-by-play role on NBC's golf coverage, including the 2016 Ryder Cup. Tirico would join Hicks to host Sunday coverage of the event. Tirico was assigned to two late-season games in the Thursday Night Football package produced for NFL Network, held on a Saturday and Christmas Sunday respectively, with Doug Flutie and Tony Dungy. In November 2016, NBC announced that Tirico would perform play-by-play with Cris Collinsworth on three Sunday Night Football games (including the Thanksgiving primetime game) and one Thursday Night Football game, filling in for Al Michaels. Michaels had requested time off due to NBC's increased NFL workload. On February 9, 2017, Bob Costas announced that he would be retiring as the primetime host of NBC's coverage of the Olympics, and that Tirico would replace him beginning at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Tirico also replaced Costas as studio host for NBC's NFL coverage and Football Night in America. On May 31, 2017, it was announced that Mike Tirico would permanently replace Al Michaels as the play-by-play commentator for all of NBC's Thursday Night Football games. In 2017, Tirico took over the role of Tom Hammond in Triple Crown coverage and became full-time as the play-by-play announcer for Notre Dame football in 2017. In the 2018 season, after losing Thursday Night Football to Fox, Tirico was assigned to NBC's Thanksgiving game, joined by his Football Night in America colleagues Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison. He also called two NFL Network Special games in December produced by Fox Sports. On February 20, 2019, Tirico called his first NHL game on NBCSN's Wednesday Night Hockey, between the Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings, joined by Eddie Olczyk on color commentator and Brian Boucher as the \\"Inside-the-Glass\\" reporter. Although he has served as studio host for selected NHL broadcasts, this marked his first broadcast as commentator. His performance was well- received by viewers and sportswriters. In a similar move to 2016, Tirico will fill-in for Al Michaels on a few Sunday Night Football games during the 2020 season. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, NBC decided to give Michaels 3-5 ‚Äúbye weeks‚Äù, in order to minimize travel. In addition, Tirico will continue to work NBC‚Äôs Thanksgiving game, and will work one of NBC‚Äôs two Wild Card games. =Broadcasting partners= Tirico has been paired in the college football booth with Tim Brant, Terry Bowden, Mike Gottfried, Kirk Herbstreit, Lee Corso, and David Norrie. Since the beginning of the 2017 season, Tirico has served as play-by-play for Notre Dame Football on NBC, partnering Doug Flutie. His partners in NBA coverage have included Tom Tolbert, Hubie Brown, and Greg Anthony. His color commentators for golf coverage were Curtis Strange, Ian Baker-Finch, Nick Faldo, and Paul Azinger. He has worked with Len Elmore on college basketball coverage. Tirico worked with Jon Gruden on NFL Monday Night Football and also the Outback Bowl (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014) and Orange Bowl (2011 and 2012). On April 21 and 22, 2007, he appeared as a guest host, filling in for Michael Wilbon, alongside Tony Kornheiser on ESPN's Pardon the Interruption. =Radio career= Tirico hosted his first show from WAER radio in Syracuse, the station where he started his sports broadcasting career, on the campus of Syracuse University. Fellow Orange alum Bob Costas was his first guest. On September 20, 2007, Tirico began hosting the short-lived The Mike Tirico Show on ESPN Radio with co-host Scott Van Pelt (later renamed Tirico &Van; Pelt in May 2008), replacing Dan Patrick in its previous timeslot. On May 19, 2009, Tirico announced he would be leaving the show to focus more on his television duties; the show would carry on as The Scott Van Pelt Show, with Ryen Russillo becoming the new co-host. =Sexual harassment controversy= Tirico's period at ESPN was not without controversy. Two books about the network, ESPN: The Uncensored History (2000) by former New York Times sportswriter Michael Freeman and 2011's These Guys Have All the Fun (by Washington Post writers James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales), recount allegations of sexual harassment. Tirico, for example, was suspended by the network for three months in 1992 for multiple incidents involving attempted groping, sexual solicitation, and stalking of female co-workers. Following the ouster of NBC colleague Matt Lauer in late 2017 over sexual misconduct, along with other high-profile names in the media industry, the network indicated it knew of Tirico's past when it hired him from ESPN and received assurances from Tirico that he had changed. Thus NBC has no intention of replacing him on Olympics coverage. According to John Wildhack, a former ESPN executive who is now the athletics director at Syracuse, \\"That happened well over two decades ago and Mike has been nothing but the consummate professional (since).\\" Personal life Tirico grew up in Queens, New York City, New York and graduated from Bayside High School and the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. Tirico and his wife, Debbie, have two children. The Tiricos have lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, since 1999. He has stated that he‚Äôs seen pictures of his father and immediate family, all of whom are insanely Italian. \\"The only contact I had growing up was with my mom‚Äôs side of the family. And they are all as white as the refrigerator I‚Äôm standing in front of right now.\\" In regard to a genealogical test to see if he has a black ancestor, he said \\"Yeah. I‚Äôd like to find out the truth at some point, so I can answer questions for my kids\\", but made it clear he does not feel any urgency.

Apart from the main entrance on 57th Street there is also an entrance located on 56th Street. Construction started in 1984, and was finished in 1987. The tower caused minor discontent, because it blocked sightlines of Central Park.

Public security is the function of governments which ensures the protection of citizens, persons in their territory, organizations, and institutions against threats to their well-being ‚Äì and to the prosperity of their communities.http://cradpdf.drdc- rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc131/p538238_A1b.pdf To meet the increasing challenges in the public security area, responsible public institutions and organisations can tap into their own intelligence to successfully address possible threats in advance. They optimise their internal structures, use synergies, and carefully balance costs and benefits of their measures. Public safety organizations include law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services. The public safety issues that a municipality, county, state, or federal jurisdiction might grapple with include narcotic use, trespassing, burglary, harassment, juvenile delinquency, unauthorized living, noise, littering, inappropriate social behavior, inebriation, and other quality of life issues. Generally organizations are involved in the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from significant danger, injury, or property damage, such as crimes or disasters (natural or human-made).  Framework  Organised crime and international terrorism are hardly deterred by geographical, linguistic, or financial barriers. Competence and administrative hurdles play into their hands. The latter has largely contributed to public security becoming an important political and economic issue, nationally as well as internationally. Politics, public organisations and businesses closely collaborate to guarantee public security and maintain a stable environment for economic prosperity. Although public security significantly contributes to the attractiveness of a location, the productivity of its people, and hence the overall success of an economy, the sector frequently suffers from low budgets, limited resources, and inadequate information systems. Large events, pandemics, severe accidents, environmental disasters, and terrorism attacks pose additional threats to public security and order. The police, federal police and border authorities nonetheless need to warrant the security of the country as a fundamental prerequisite for the domestic political ability to act. The quality and scope of potential threats have changed significantly, and the tasks and general framework for the police, federal police and border authorities have changed accordingly. = National = *Federal agency for technical relief *Federal criminal investigation department *Federal Customs and Border Administration / U.S. Customs and Border Protection *Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) *Federal ministry such as Interior, Justice or Public safety *Federal police / Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) = Regional = *City or town police e.g. Bryan Police Department, Texas (US) *County police e.g. Fairfax County Police Department, Virginia (US) *Sheriff's department *State police or provincial police e.g. Massachusetts State Police, Massachusetts (US) = Local = *Fire brigade *Local police authority or department *Mayor's office / Local government *Municipal public affairs office  Sub-sectors  There are five sub-sectors within public security: = Law enforcement = Police Services: *National / Federal police *Regional / Local police = Intelligence and information sharing = *Intelligence / Investigative services *Secret services = Emergency management = Emergency services include: *Emergency medical service *Fire service *Police *Search and rescue = Justice = Judicial services include: *Courts Judges Juries Lawyers and advocates *Forensic *Justice ministry *Prisons Interior services include: *Border and port authorities *Coast guard *Customer services Organizations * By nation  In Australia, Australian Institute of Public Safety, Australian Federal Police https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx http://www.psba.qld.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx  In Brazil, National Secretariat of Public Safety  In Canada, Public Safety Canada  In France, Committee of Public Safety  In Japan, National Public Safety Commission (Japan)  In South Korea, National Police Commission (South Korea)  In United Kingdom, Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Northern Ireland only)  In United States, Department of Public Safety  In Mongolia, State Emergency Commission (Mongolia) * Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International * Civil defense * Civil defense sirens * Coast guard * Common Alerting Protocol * Consumer Product Safety Commission * Emergency management * Emergency telephone number * Firefighting *Neighborhood Watch * Food safety * Guardian Angels * Good safety practice * National Highway Traffic Safety Administration * Natural disaster * No-go area * Occupational safety and health * Office of Emergency Management * Personal protective equipment * Police * Public health * Public safety network * Public security * Risk * Road traffic safety * Safety engineering * SafetyLit  See also  * Homeland security * Justice * Law enforcement * Public safety * Societal security References  External links  * Murray N.

The first session was attended by 37 students. In 1888, when about 130 boys were attending, it moved to 61 Maliban Street. C. W. Leadbeater was appointed the first principal of Ananda today. By the time the school was officially registered in March 1889, there were 120 students. That same year, J. P. R. Weerasuriya became the first Anandian to pass the Cambridge junior examination. The Cambridge graduate and confessed Buddhist A. E. Bultjens became principal.Ananda College, Colombo; Buddhist Annual of Ceylon, Vol. I (1920), 1, p. 41. In March 1890, the school's proximity to a Catholic school led to controversy‚Äîand a move to 54 Maliban Street where further growth ensued, and student enrollments rose to 200 in September 1892 and 270 in 1894. As principals followed Don Baron Jayatilaka. That year, Mr. Tudor Rajapaksha donated of landMilestones on official website and the school was relocated in the suburb of Maradana. On 17 August 1895, the former English Buddhist School was renamed to Ananda College Colombo. When Patrick de Silva Kularatne took over in 1918 attendance was 450 which rapidly increased to 1000 two years later. At this time the annual budget was 80000 Rs.

Life He was one of the eleven children of Ant√≥nio Jos√© Gomes, (Santo Estev√£o, Chaves, ? ‚Äì Lisbon, 1 July 1922) and wife, Idalina J√∫lia Monteiro da Costa (Chaves, 27 May 1880 ‚Äì Porto, 18 February 1967). On 8 December 1952, Gomes married Maria Estela Veloso de Antas Varaj√£o (born 23 March 1927 in Viana do Castelo), daughter of Jo√£o de Campos Varaj√£o and his wife Ang√©lica Martins Veloso (b. Barcelos, Barcelos), at the See of Viana do Castelo. The couple had only one son, Francisco da Costa Gomes. In 1961 Costa Gomes, acting as under-secretary of state for the Army, was involved in a constitutional \\"coup d'√©tat\\" headed by the Minister of Defense, General J√∫lio Botelho Moniz, that tried to convince President Am√©rico Tom√°s to remove an aged Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar from the premiership. In 1970 he occupied the post of Commander of the Military Region of Angola, where he overhauled the chief-command and was the first to try to establish a military agreement with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) against the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). On 12 September 1972 he was called back to Portugal to occupy the post of Chief of the Armed Forces‚Äîreplacing General Ven√¢ncio Deslandes‚Äîbut he was replaced in March 1974, a few days before the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, because he had refused to swear his loyalty to the President of the Council of Ministers Marcello Caetano in a public ceremony. After the Revolution he was one of the seven military leaders who made up the National Salvation Junta. Between 25 April and 30 September he was the second-in- command of the Portuguese state, behind Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola. He assumed the Presidency of the Republic when named by the Junta after the resignation of Sp√≠nola on 30 September 1974, and occupied the post until 27 June 1976 when, in the first Presidential election, the Portuguese chose General Ramalho Eanes to succeed him. He received an honorary promotion to Field Marshal in 1982. Personal Gomes was one of eleven children of Ant√≥nio Jos√© Gomes (Chaves, Santo Est√™v√£o ‚Äì Lisbon, Socorro, 1 July 1922) and wife (m.

Part of a cluster of four tall buildings (along with CitySpire Center, Metropolitan Tower and One57), the tower was built in an architectural style in harmony with its western neighbor Carnegie Hall, an official city and national landmark. Overview The tower is 757 feet (231 m) tall and was completed in 1991 following the design by Cesar Pelli first conceived in 1987. This design won an Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1994.Lobby The Carnegie Hall Tower seems impossibly slim from the front (the main shaft is wide) however has wide sides facing its neighbors, the Russian Tea Room and Metropolitan Tower on the east and Carnegie Hall on the west. It was clad in brick and glazed brick of several colors, with precast concrete lintels above windows, and painted metal bands at intervals of six floors. The large cornice atop the shaft is an open trellis of wide-flange steel sections. The lobby and common rooms are covered in marble and granite with hardwood and brass accents. The structural system for this extremely slender tower (2.8:1 aspect ratio above the 44th floor) is two joined tubes of cast-in-place concrete, designed by engineer Jacob Grossman of Robert Rosenwasser Associates. In 2001, former President Bill Clinton had planned to locate his office on the 56th floor of Carnegie Hall Tower. After facing heavy criticism over the $738,000 annual cost to be paid for by taxpayers, Clinton instead chose office space on 125th Street in the Harlem neighborhood.

Its aim was to have been regulation of currency exchange, a role eventually taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The International Clearing Union (ICU) would be a global bank whose job would be the clearance of trade between nations, similar to a trade exchange with every country as a member. All international trade would be denominated in a special unit of account, the proposed bancor. The bancor was to have had a fixed exchange rate with national currencies, and would have been used to measure the balance of trade between nations. Every good exported would add bancors to a country's account, while every good imported would subtract them. Each nation would be incentivized to keep their bancor balance close to zero by one of two methods to be applied as required. In the case of an excessively positive bancor balance, part of their surplus would be taken and applied to the Clearing Union's Reserve Fund. In the case of an excessively negative bancor balance, their currency‚Äôs exchange rate would be lowered, making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. In this way nations would be encouraged to buy other nations‚Äô products. Gold and national currency would no longer be used in international trade and no longer move between countries.

Life and career Browning was born in Edna, Texas, grew up in Jackson County, Texas, and graduated from Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1937, majoring in both math and physics. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Subsequently, he earned an M.A. at the University of Texas at Austin in 1947, and then his doctorate (Ph.D.) the following year at the same school. His doctorate was in zoology, with minors in genetics and bacteriology. Browning worked in various scientific fields, including artificial intelligence and bio-engineering, and eventually became interested in long-term weather forecasting and climate changes. He believed that climate fluctuations are caused by changes in the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere mostly from volcanic activity. He believed that volcanic activity can be triggered by land tidal forces caused by the Moon, Earth's elliptical orbit of the Sun, and the alignment of these three bodies. His climate predictions assumed that the dust thrown into the atmosphere by those eruptions reflects sunlight, which results in climatic cooling. Browning believed that climatic changes, especially cooling, are associated with increased troubles in human society, including famine, revolutions, and war.Winkless, Nels III and Browning, Iben. Climate and the Affairs of Men, Fraser Publishing, 1975. After founding The Browning Newsletter in 1974,https://browningclimate.com/about/ Browning described his climatic theories and findings in Climate and the Affairs of Men (1975), which he co-authored with Nels Winkless III. At that time, he believed that Earth had been through a long warm period and was moving into a dangerous cooling phase. He also declared that he had not detected any effect of human activity on the climate. Browning received notoriety for his erroneous prediction that a major earthquake would occur on the New Madrid Fault around December 2 and 3, 1990. This prediction had no scientific legitimacy, and was largely ignored by credentialed seismologists, who thought it would give the prediction undeserved attention if they had debunked it in public. In spite of this it was widely reported in the national media, which promoted fear, anxiety, and hysteria among residents of the Mississippi Valley. No earthquake occurred in that area on those dates. A study done by the USGS to understand the causes of the earthquake scare described Browning's methodology as pseudoscience.. Browning wrote four books, held 90 patents, and served as a climatologist and business consultant to Paine Webber in various scientific and engineering fields. He was married to the former Florence Pinto and had one daughter, Evelyn Browning-Garriss.,https://www.desmogblog.com/evelyn- browning-garriss who succeeded him as editor of 'The Browning Newsletter'.

He served as the second bishop of the Diocese of Dubuque following the death of Mathias Loras. Biography =Early life & Ministry= Timothy Smyth was born on February 24, 1810 in Finlea, County Clare, Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Smyth initially entered a community of teaching brothers, the Brothers of the Presentation. He left that community after six years and took the name of Clement when he entered Mount Melleray Abbey in 1838. He professed religious vows as a member of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, also known as the Trappists. He was ordained a priest at the abbey on May 29, 1841. Father Smyth founded a school for boys at Mount Melleray and another school developed outside the abbey gates for girls. Because of the devastation brought about by the Great Famine in Ireland in the 1840s the community started looking for a place in North America for a new abbey where the monks could farm the land. A place near Bedford, Pennsylvania was acquired and Father Smyth, as prior, along with another monk were sent to establish a new monastery. The property was deemed unsuitable, as well as other property the small community looked at in both the United States and Canada. Eventually they came to the Dubuque, Iowa area where the Trappists were invited to establish a monastery in the diocese by Mathias Loras, Bishop of Dubuque. After resigning as prior, Smyth again established a school at New Melleray according to Loras' wishes. He was again appointed prior of the monastery on December 6, 1849. =Coadjutor bishop= Loras realized that his health was failing and he requested a coadjutor bishop from the Holy See. On January 9, 1857 Pope Pius IX named Smyth the Titular Bishop of Thennesus and Coadjutor Bishop of Dubuque. Because of the time involved in sending communications, the papers from Rome did not arrive in Dubuque until April, 1857. On May 9, 1857, Smyth was consecrated by Peter Richard Kenrick, Archbishop of St. Louis. John Henni, Bishop of Milwaukee, and Anthony O'Regan, Bishop of Chicago, served as co-consecrators. Shortly after his episcopal consecration, Smyth was assigned administrator of the Diocese of Chicago while O'Reagan went to Rome to resign his See. For the six months he served in this position he resided in Dubuque and traveled to Chicago by train. He had to deal with an apostate priest, Charles Paschal Chiniquy, who had set up a schismatic church in Kankakee, Illinois. Smyth was shot at as he left the town after he publicly excommunicated Chiniquy. The Altar of the Mortuary Chapel at St. Raphael's Cathedral Smyth's final resting place After his consecration as bishop, Smyth directed the construction of the present St. Raphael's Cathedral. Loras' health continued to decline, but he was well enough to hold the first Mass in the new cathedral on Christmas Day, 1857. Just under two months later, Loras died, February 20, 1858. On that day, Smyth succeeded Loras as the second bishop of Dubuque. =Bishop of Dubuque= Smyth was known for his deep piety and boundless charity. He would oversee the continued expansion of the church's presence in Iowa as immigration continued into the state. Because of difficult economic times and the American Civil War, not much progress was made on building new churches.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05179b.htm However, he was able to recruit Irish priests to the diocese, primarily from All Hallows College in Dublin. This caused discontent among the French born priests and many of them left the diocese.Luby, S.D. Dubuque, Archdiocese of (Dubuquensis) New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. IV (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967) 1084 A happier occasion for Smyth occurred in 1863 when he consecrated Ephraim McDonnell as the first abbot for New Melleray after it had been elevated to an abbey by the Holy See. During the Civil War, Dubuque was a center of pro-Confederate sympathies. In 1863 Smyth learned of the existence of the pro-Southern Knights of the Golden Circle. He gave Iowa members who might be Catholic two weeks to withdraw from the organization or be automatically excommunicated. One of the most outspoken critics of President Lincoln and the abolitionists was the editor of the local Democratic newspaper and a friend and an advisor to Loras, Dennis A. Mahoney. Smyth, unlike Loras who had spent many years as a missionary in Alabama and as a slaveholder, supported the Union cause. Smyth preached a stinging sermon after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. That evening Smyth lost his coach house, carriage and horses to an arsonist. Local citizens, both Catholic and Protestant, built a new coach house and bought a new carriage and a pair of horses for the bishop. Smyth led the diocese for seven years until his death on September 22, 1865. He was succeeded by John Hennessy, who became Dubuque's first archbishop. Before his death in 1900, Hennessy requested that a mortuary chapel be built to serve as a final resting place for bishops and archbishops of Dubuque. In 1902 the mortuary chapel was completed. Smyth's body was brought to the cathedral, and reburied in the mortuary chapel.

The older members of the Hearte family remained through most of the show's run and later storylines revolved around their interactions with neighbours and friends. A high point of the series occurred in 1982 with the wedding of Gayle and Gavin. Rehearsals took place in a local community hall in Avalon, and ‚ÄúClose to Home‚Äù was mostly shot in the largest NZBC TV studio, No 8, at Avalon Studios, Avalon, Lower Hutt, which had sets round the studio of rooms in various characters‚Äô houses plus the bar of the local hotel. It was criticised for the number of scenes set in the bar, but that was the only place apart from private homes that scenes could be set in without going on location, which was infrequent. The show featured John Bach, who went on to have his own TV series, Duggan, and appear in various films. Jennifer Ward-Lealand appeared as a school friend of Gayle's after Fiona Lovatt's contract expired. Jim Moriarty played a school teacher.

The station airs a country music radio format and is owned by Guaranty Broadcasting Company of Baton Rouge, LLC. Along with four sister stations, its studios and offices are at the Guaranty Group building on Government Street east of downtown Baton Rouge. WTGE's transmitter is located near the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, south of Louisiana State University.Radio-Locator.com/WTGE The station broadcasts in the HD radio digital format. In 2003, WTGE began airing the syndicated Big D and Bubba Show in morning drive time. History =Easy Listening WQXY= On August 10, 1966, the station signed on as WQXY.Broadcasting Yearbook 1968 page B-71 The station was owned by Sound Dimensions, Inc., with Ken Winstanley serving as the president and general manager. The studios were on Wooddale Boulevard. It aired an easy listening format with some jazz music. The power was 100,000 watts but the tower was only 410 feet tall, a fraction of its current height above average terrain. By the 1970s, WQXY was supplied its easy listening tapes from Schulke Radio, a national syndicator. During Winstanley's ownership, WQXY broadcast \\"Moon Glow With Martin,\\" hosted by popular disc jockey Dick Martin. Winstanley also owned WYLA-FM & WYLK-FM New Orleans along with WPCF-FM and WDLP, Panama City, Florida. He also had ownership interest in KCIL-FM and KJIN in Houma, Louisiana, plus other Southeast radio stations. Winstanley sold WQXY in 1970 to Allison Kolb CEO / Gulf Union Corporation and moved his broadcasting enterprises to Florida. The station was acquired by Airwaves, Inc. and operated by owners Lamar Simmons and Gene Nelson throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Airwaves owned sister AM station WLCS, AM 910, and was responsible for moving both stations from the AM's original location in downtown Baton Rouge to (then) Suite 2420 of One American Place, the skyscraper completed by American Bank in 1974. The stations shared the top floor of the building with the bank's Board Room, the chambers of Judge Alvin Rubin of the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and a federal agency office. Throughout that period until its 1984 sale, WQXY remained Baton Rouge's only beautiful music station and a Schulke affiliate. =Switch to AC= In 1984, WQXY and sister station AM 910 WLCS (now silent) were acquired by the Oppenheimer Broadcast Group of Austin, Texas. The format was switched to Adult Contemporary and the familiar black-and-red easy listening \\"rose logo\\" was replaced by a bloc sans-serif blue logo. The move left Baton Rouge without a beautiful music station for the first time in decades, and it angered a large portion of the station's traditional base. The new AC format was duplicated by several other Baton Rouge stations, and the ratings were not good. Management decided a change was needed. In 1988, WQXY flipped to Active Rock as \\"100.7 The Tiger.\\" To go along with the format change, it became WTGE-FM. In the early 1990s, WTGE-FM got a boost in antenna height.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-173 It began using a tower that was about as tall as the Empire State Building. By 1995, WTGE-FM shifted to Modern Rock. But that would all change a year later. =Country Music= WTGE-FM made the switch to country music in 1996.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1997 page B-190 It became WXCT using the moniker \\"Cat Country 100.7.\\" That put it in competition with longtime Baton Rouge country outlet WYNK-FM, just one position up the FM dial at 101.5 MHz. WXCT was reimaged in 2001 as \\"Tiger Country 100.7,\\" returning to the WTGE call letters. In February 2002, WTGE tweaked its playlist and became \\"Y-100\\" using the call letters WYPY. In 2003, WYPY became the Baton Rouge affiliate for the Big D and Bubba Show, previously heard in morning drive time on competitor WYNK-FM. In 2005, WYPY began calling itself \\"New Country.\\" In late 2008, the station became \\"New Country 100.7 the Tiger.\\" On September 22, 2010, WYPY returned to the call letters WTGE, to go with \\"The Tiger\\" branding.

Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case involving a school district's ability to hold classes on Bible study after school. Background Westside High School, in District 66, located in Omaha, Nebraska, refused to allow a group of students to form a Christian Bible Study Club within their school. Bridget Mergens is the name of the student who initiated the process to start the club. She was a senior at the time. It was decided that the club could not take place because they would not allow a staff member to sponsor it (staff sponsoring was required or the club meetings could not take place at the school). The students argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing ‚Äúreligious, political, philosophical, or other content‚Äù not be denied the ability to form clubs. Opinion of the Court In an 8-1 decision,. the Court held that the club could hold their meetings, but that their sponsor could not be paid, as this would constitute an endorsement of religion prohibited by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The school's situation was placed under the Equal Access Act because it allowed other ‚Äòlimited open forums‚Äô. In Part III of Justice O'Connor's opinion, which did not reach a majority of the Court, she applied the Lemon Test to find that the Equal Access Act is constitutional as applied in this case. Justice Kennedy, meanwhile, analyzed the application of the Act under different Court precedents, focusing more upon \\"coercion\\". =Dissent= Justice Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, would have avoided the Establishment Clause issue.

It features Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield, the house cat, re-imagined as a private detective named Sam Spayed attempting to solve a murder mystery. The special won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (One Hour or Less). It has since been released on DVD. This was the ninth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  Feeling bored, Garfield looks into a closet and finds a trenchcoat and fedora. Donning both, he begins to fantasize he is Sam Spayed, a second-rate private investigator in a film noir atmosphere. Sam receives a visit from Tanya O'Tabby, a beautiful woman who hires Sam to investigate the death of her husband, Professor O'Tabby, who apparently drove off a clifftop road. Tanya believes it was murder, as her husband was an excellent driver, but the death was ruled as a simple car accident. Despite initially suspecting foul play (that Tanya killed her husband either for his money or because he was unfaithful), Sam agrees to take the case. No solid proof of murder comes to light when Sam visits the morgue, although he notes that O'Tabby's shirt, chest and stomach hairs have yellowish-brown stains on them and secretly pockets a mysterious, painted \\"stone\\" that the coroner overlooked. Next, Sam goes to the university where O'Tabby worked and meets the late man's colleague and former advisor Professor O'Felix. He tells Sam how O'Tabby was on his way to visit an elderly benefactress the night he died, but dismisses Sam's idea that the professor was having an affair, saying his one weakness was instead a coffee addiction. Sam phones Tanya to tell her what he knows so far, only for his newly-hired secretary Kitty to spill coffee on him when he mentions talking to O'Felix about O'Tabby's \\"woman trouble\\". While cleaning himself up, Sam realizes that the \\"stone\\" is actually a ceramic fragment from a broken coffee mug and the stains on the late professor's clothing and body must have been coffee. He deduces that Kitty worked for O'Tabby before she came to Sam's office, and accuses Kitty of O'Tabby's murder, believing her motive was that she loved O'Tabby but the professor didn't love her. Kitty breaks down into tears, insisting that she did not kill the professor, having simply left the university out of being unable to bear not having him. She also explains that she did more than make coffee for O'Tabby, also filling his prescriptions for potent sleeping pills to counter his coffee-induced insomnia. Deducing O'Felix is the murderer, Sam brings him to court. O'Felix was jealous of his former student's success and murdered him by spiking his coffee with some sleeping pills, causing O'Tabby to fall asleep at the wheel and drive off the cliff to his death. Tanya visits Sam one last time, making it very clear that the romance he had hoped to have with her will never happen. Kitty starts to seduce Sam, only for reality to intrude via owner Jon Arbuckle asking Garfield what he's doing in the closet.

Ron Tuthill wrote the \\"Babes and Bullets: The Continuing Adventures of Sam Spayed\\" chapter, illustrated by Kevin Campbell. Film noir parodies were popular in films, with Sam Spayed and Tracer Bullet in Calvin and Hobbes marking the parody's crossover to comic strips. The television adaptation was written by Davis. It was directed and produced by Phil Roman under his company, Film Roman.  Broadcast and release  After the airing of the initial animated Garfield: His 9 Lives special on November 22, 1988, Garfield's Babes and Bullets aired on May 23, 1989. It played on prime time on CBS. The special was included on the DVD Garfield Fantasies, released in May 2005. It was featured along with the specials Garfield: His 9 Lives and Garfield's Feline Fantasies (1990).  Reception  Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, the inspiration for the Garfield character. The special won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (One Hour or Less) in 1989. The animated version of Garfield: His 9 Lives was also nominated that year. In his DVD Talk review, Randy Miller III called Garfield Fantasies the most unusual of the Garfield DVD collections, adding Babes and Bullets \\"ain't exactly Sin City here, but this amusing caper is one of the best of the bunch.\\" Author Mitzi M. Brunsdale described Sam Spayed as one of the \\"strange spinoffs\\" of the Sam Spade character, created by Dashiell Hammett in the novel The Maltese Falcon. Turner Classic Movies identified Sam Spayed particularly as a parody of 1940s film detectives and Humphrey Bogart, who starred as Spade in the 1941 film version of The Maltese Falcon.

Military tradition is the practices associated with the military or soldiers such as the styles of military uniform, drill, or the music of a military unit. In the United States In the United States, military tradition can refer simply to a father-son relationship or a much longer, ancestors-long line (which is the normal meaning). Military tradition refers to the tradition in a family to systematically destine one of its sons for a military career. This tradition is associated to the Southern United States who, as a whole, would have a military tradition. This is represented in the much higher representation of Southerners in the U.S. Military today and throughout the nation's history. In Europe In Europe, tradition was a principle of military culture that had evolved out of the Middle Ages' concept of chivalry. Within Europe a wide variety of separate military traditions developed until at least World War I. Subsequently major political and social changes have tended to break-down the historical continuity that had been a source of military tradition in many armies. In Britain, military traditions developed primarily along regimental lines, taking the form of long-established regimental customs, insignia, badges and distinctive features of uniform. Since the late 1960s, a series of regimental mergers and disbandments have diluted British military tradition, although it still remains strong in the Guards Division. A French zouave from 1888 in the distinctive campaign uniform worn in North Africa. His trousers would normally be red. In Prussia and the German Empire, states relied on their own history to maintain military traditions, although some specific regiments within elite formations did maintain distinctive customs and items of dress. For example, one regiment, the Potsdam Grenadiers, consisted of extremely tall men. The French created the concept of Esprit de Corps, or pride in ones unit, within most elite or uniquely French units. North African units like the Zouaves, the Turcos, the French Foreign Legion, or even the Mamelukes which served in Napoleon Bonaparte's Imperial Guard developed distinctive styles of dress. Many of these distinctive styles were later adopted by the French Metropolitan Army during the nineteenth century. In Japan A traditional samurai warrior, circa 1860. Photograph by Felice Beato In Japan, most military tradition was based on the bushido code. Bushido, translated as 'way of the warrior' in English, was the strict code of military discipline adhered to by Samurai warriors. In fiction Military Tradition is used in the strategy game Sid Meier's Civilization III, released by Atari, as a technological advance that allows the building of cavalry units. Military Tradition is a game concept in the strategy game Europa Universalis IV released by Swedish PC strategy game designer, Paradox Interactive. In the game, a player-controlled faction can accumulate Military Tradition by engaging in land battle. A higher Military Tradition value results in the ability to recruit generals and conquistadors of better quality. Distinct elements of a military culture are also present in many fictional publications. These are often used as an important element in shaping fictional culture by authors.

Department of the Controller  Spending branches are in the department of the controller, and it will be well, while we are dealing with the material side of the Royal Navy, to describe briefly their character and duties. The civil branches of the navy tributary to the controller are those of the director of naval construction, the engineer-in-chief, the directors of naval ordnance, of dockyards and of stores, and the inspector of dockyard expense accounts. The first duty of the controller is, as has been explained, in relation to the design and construction of ships and their machinery, and the executive officials who have charge of that work are the director of naval construction and the engineer-in-chief, whose operations are closely interrelated. A vast administrative stride has been made in this particular branch of the admiralty. The work of design and construction now go forward together, and the admiralty designers are in close touch with the work in hand at the dockyards. This has been largely brought about by the institution, in 1883, of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors. Royal Corps of Naval Constructors The Royal Corps of Naval Constructors, whose members interchange their duties between the designing of ships at the admiralty and practical work at the dockyards. It is through the Director of Naval Construction that many of the spending departments are set in motion, since he is responsible both for the design of ships and for their construction. It deserves to be noticed, however, that a certain obscurity exists in regard, to the relative duties of the director of naval construction and the director of dockyards touching constructive works in the yards. The former officer has also charge of all the work given out to contract, though it is the business of the dockyard officials to certify that the conditions of the contract have been fulfilled. In all this work the director of naval construction collaborates with the engineer-in-chief, who is an independent officer and not a subordinate, and whose procedure in regard to machinery closely resembles that adopted in the matter of contract-built ships. Director of Naval Ordnance The Director of Naval Ordnance is another officer of the Controller's Department whose operations are very closely related to the duties of the Director of Naval Construction, and the relation is both intimate and sustained, for in the Ordnance department everything that relates to guns, gun-mountings, magazines, torpedo apparatus, electrical fittings for guns, and other electrical fittings is centred. A singular feature of this branch of administration is that the navy long since lost direct control of ordnance matters, through the duties connected with naval gunnery, formerly in the hands of the Master-General of the Ordnance, and those of the Board of Ordnance which is a department common to the sea and land services which was vested in the Secretary of State for War from 1855. A more satisfactory state of things has grown up through the appointment of the director of naval ordnance, taking the place of the naval officer who formerly advised the director of artillery at the War Office. Expenditure on ordnance has also been transferred from the army to the navy estimates, and a Naval Ordnance Store Department has been created. It cannot be said that the condition is yet satisfactory, nor can it be until the navy has control of and responsibility for its own ordnance. The Assistant-Director of Torpedoes is an officer instituted at the Admiralty within recent years, and his duty is to assist the director of naval ordnance in all torpedo matters. Director of Dockyards The director of dockyards replaced the surveyor of dockyards in 1885, at about which time the inspector of dockyard expense accounts was instituted. It is upon the director of dockyards (q.v.) that the responsibility of the controller devolves in regard to the management of dockyards and naval establishments at home and abroad, and to the performance of work in these estab lishments, ship and boat building, maintenance, repairs and refits. In this department the programme for work in the dockyards is prepared, as well as certain sections of the navy estimates. Stores Department The Stores Department has the director of stores as its chief. This officer, about the year 1869, took over the storekeeping duties previously vested in the storekeeper-general. The Naval Store Department is charged with the custody and issue of naval, as distinguished from victualling and ordnance stores, to be used in naval dockyards and establishments for the building, fitting and repairing of warships. It has, however, no concern with stores that belong to the Department of Works. The business of the director of stores is also to receive and issue the stores for ships of all classes in commission and reserve, and he deals with a vast array of objects and materials necessary for the fleet, and with coals and coaling. He frames the estimates for his department, but his purchases are made through the director of navy contracts. In practice the main business of the Stores Department is to see to the provision of stores for the navy, and to the proper supply of these at all the establishments, and for this purpose its officials direct the movements of storeships, and arrange for the despatch of colliers, the director being charged to be careful to provide for His Majesty's ships on foreign stations, and for the necessary supplies to foreign yards. Another important business of the director of stores is the examination of the store accounts of ships as well as some other accounts. Although the director of stores is really in the department of the controller, he is supervised in regard to the coaling of the fleet by the junior naval lord. The inspector of dockyard expense accounts has been alluded to. He is the officer charged with keeping a record of expenditure at the dockyards and of supervising expense accounts. The spending of money within the Controller's Department. It may be useful to add a note concerning the spending of the money. Within the controller's department, as has been explained, are centred the more important spending branches of the admiralty. While the work of design-tuning ships and preparing plans is in progress, the director of stores, the director of dockyards and other officials of that department concerned are making preparation for the work. The necessary stores, comprising almost every imaginable class of materials, are brought together, and the director of stores is specially charged to obtain accurate information in regard to requirements. He is not, however, a purchasing officer, that work being undertaken by the director of navy contracts, who is concerned with the whole business of supply, except in regard to hulls and machinery of ships built by contract, and the special requirements of the director of works. At the same time, the civil departments of the admiralty being held responsible for the administration of the votes they compile, it is their duty to watch the outlay of money; and to see that it is well expended, the accountant-general being directed to assist them in this work. The system is closely jointed and well administered, but it possesses a very centralized character, which interferes to some extent with flexible working, and with the progress of necessary repairs, especially in foreign yards. Insofar as ships given out to contract are concerned (and the same is the case in regard to propelling machinery built by contract), the director of navy contracts plays no part, the professional business being conducted through the controller of the navy, who is advised thereon by the director of naval construction and the engineer-in- chief. The work conducted in private establishments is closely watched by the admiralty officials, and is thoroughly tested, but, mutatis mutandis, the system in regard to contract-built ships is practically the same as that which prevails in the dockyards. Account-General's Department (Naval Finance) Naval Finance: The Accountant-General's Department. The subject of naval finance is one of great complexity and of vast importance. The large sums of money with which the admiralty deals in the way of both estimates and expenditure, amounting recently to about 30,000,000 annually, implies the existence of the great organization which is found in the department of the accountant-general of the navy. Under the authority of the first lord, the parliamentary and financial secretary is responsible for the finance of the admiralty in general, and for the estimates and the expenditure, the accounts and the purchases, and for all matters which concern the relations of the admiralty to the treasury and to other departments of the government; and in all the practical and advisory work the accountant-general is his officer, acting as his assistant with the director of naval contracts who, under the several lords, is concerned with the business of purchase. The organization of the accountant-general's department has undergone many changes, and the resulting condition is the outcome of various modifications which have had for their purpose.

Project duo W and their first album recorded and released after its members, Ai Kago and Nozomi Tsuji, \\"graduated\\" from Morning Musume in August 2004. Unlike their first album, Duo U&U;, which was all cover material, 2nd W contains a mix of originals (composed by mentor and Hello! Project founder Tsunku) and covers of classic Sh≈çwa period female pop duo songs. Three of the songs, the Tsunku originals \\"Ai Ii na!\\" and \\"Robo Kiss\\" and a cover of The Peanuts's \\"Koi No Fuga\\", were released as singles in the months prior to the album; the latter selection was also the single released in advance of the album. Many of the songs on the album, both originals and covers, center around the topic of becoming, or about to no longer be, the age of seventeen. At the time of the album's release, Ai Kago had turned 17 a month prior, while Nozomi Tsuji would turn 18 that June. Another track, \\"Da-bu-ru-yuu Joshi Koutou Gakkou Kouka\\", is the mock-theme song for the fictional \\"Dabaruyuu Girls Senior School\\" (The nonsense word \\"Dabaruyuu\\" being a corruption of the duo's name) and ties in with the album cover concept depicting Kago and Tsuji at a school ceremony. The duo would release one more single while retaining their earlier cute image, \\"Ai no Imi wo Oshiete!\\". Their following single, \\"Miss Love Tantei\\", would see the pair utilizing a more mature look and sound. The first press of the album comes with three photo cards and comes in special packaging.

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast on May 18, 1990 on CBS and September 10, 1991 on CITV and was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program at the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards. It has been released on both VHS and DVD home video. This was the eleventh of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. This is the only Garfield special not to feature Lou Rawls.  Storyline  Garfield's fantasy life is beginning to take over his real life, in a Walter Mitty-esque fashion. He slips into a fantasy world at any moment, sometimes without warning, and most are threatening. In one of these fantasies, which composes the bulk of the special, he is Lance Sterling, a mix of James Bond and Indiana Jones. With his associate Slobberjob (Odie, who Garfield brought into the fantasy with him), he travels to exotic locations like Istanbul, Paris, and the Amazon rainforest to find \\"The Banana of Bombay,\\" and lay claim to it before his enemy \\"Fat Guy\\" gets to it first. On the way they meet a mysterious Moldavian lady named Nadia, who has an agenda of her own.  Plot  Garfield is dreaming about being a submarine captain with Pooky as his commanding officer. When Garfield's alarm clock wakes him up, Garfield continues the dream's storyline and fires a torpedo (smashes the alarm clock). Enjoying this, Garfield enters a cowboy fantasy when greeting Odie for the morning and a magician fantasy when waking up Jon to make them breakfast. Odie joins him in the latter fantasy. Garfield tells Odie their fantasies are not dangerous as Jon is always there to bail them out. They test this theory by entering a fantasy where they are jet pilots of a plane with faulty engines. When Jon saves them from falling, they decide the theory is correct and climb into the refrigerator, entering another fantasy. In the fantasy, Garfield is Lance Sterling, a James-Bond-meets-Indiana-Jones figure, and Odie is Slobberjob, his bodyguard. The two travel to Istanbul and meet a villain named Fat Guy and his bodyguard Rameet. It is revealed Lance Sterling and Slobberjob have been sent to find the Banana of Bombay, the first banana used in the banana-peel gag. However, it disappeared years ago, and the holy ankh which contained a map to find it was split in half. Fat Guy explains he wants to sell the Banana to whichever country pays the most for it. Lance Sterling insults Fat Guy before agreeing to unite his half of the holy ankh with Fat Guy's. However, Lane Sterling steals Fat Guy's half of the ankh before escaping with Slobberjob. When Fat Guy's henchmen pursue them, a woman named Nadia distracts the henchmen so the protagonists can escape. She claims Lance Sterling and Slobberjob's employers sent her to protect them, but Lance Sterling says they don't need the help and tells her to leave. Lance Sterling and Slobberjob combine the holy ankh pieces with a supercomputer and discover the ankh's map does not point to the Banana of Bombay, but a clue to the Banana's true location. They travel to Paris, and meet Nadia again after a humorous misunderstanding with a French waiter. She tells them Fat Guy and Rameet are tracking them, and after Slobberjob attempts to take on Rameet, he is thrown at an awning and discovers a map to the Banana of Bombay. Arriving in the Amazon rainforest, Lance Sterling and Slobberjob enter a temple holding the Banana of Bombay. They discover the Banana on a pillar in the middle of a pool of lava, but it is taken by Nadia. She explains she is from Moldavia, which is a poor country, so the Moldavian government has decided to invest in tourism and they need the Banana to open a fruit stand. Fat Guy and Rameet take the banana and trap Lance Sterling, Nadia, and Slobberjob on the pillar. Rameet falls in the lava, and Slobberjob manages to get everyone off the pillar. A group of monkeys steal the Banana of Bombay from Fat Guy, but Lance Sterling and Slobberjob obtain the Banana and flee the temple, pursued by Fat Guy, Nadia, and the monkeys. They are cornered at a cliff, but use the Banana to slip all their adversaries and make them fall into a river. Rameet, who survived falling into the lava, confronts them, and they are forced to jump off the cliff. Ending the fantasy, Garfield and Odie fall out of the refrigerator. When Jon asks Garfield if he had another fantasy, Garfield states it was his last one, only to enter another fantasy that mirrors Casablanca.

The station serves Monroe, Michigan and the surrounding area, including Toledo, Ohio where it's studios are located. It is owned by Cumulus Media, and its transmitter is located in Harbor View, Ohio. History The 98.3 frequency was licensed to Monroe for most of its history. The station signed on in July 1967 as WVMO (Voice of Monroe), founded by John Koehn of Adrian (also the founder of Adrian's WLEN 103.9 FM), and early on was a block-programmed station typical of small markets, featuring blocks of MOR, country music and Top 40 programming. According to a Billboard magazine item from June 1972, the station was on the air from 5:45 am to midnight and played MOR music until 6 p.m., when country DJ Dan Baker took over. WVMO was also an early radio job for Paul W. Smith, now morning host at Detroit's WJR. In September 13, 1982, WVMO was purchased by Bruce Lesnick of Lesnick Communications, Inc. He grabbed the call letters WTWR - which had recently been relinquished by an FM station in Detroit - and debuted \\"Tower 98\\", with an adult contemporary music format, which evolved into Top 40/CHR by the late 1990s. \\"Tower 98\\" served as \\"Monroe's Hit Music Station,\\" with a minimal ratings presence in Toledo, until March 2003, when the station, now under Cumulus ownership, was granted a construction permit to change its city of license to Luna Pier and to move its transmitter south into Lucas County, Ohio, from Monroe County, Michigan. For a time after the move, the station's playlist was so rhythmic-heavy that it began reporting to Radio & Records as a CHR/Rhythmic outlet rather than CHR/Pop (although it never did totally eliminate mainstream pop and rock music from its rotation), but returned to a CHR/Pop reporting status. Tower 98 took on the station name change from \\"Tower 98\\" to \\"Tower 98-3\\" in September 2005. This was when its reporting status went from CHR/Rhythmic back to CHR/Pop. Since the transition from Monroe to Toledo in early 2004, \\"Tower 98-3\\" has seen four programming directors: Terri McCormmick, \\"Train\\", Brent Carey and Steve Marshall. From Summer 2005 to Winter 2006, \\"Tower 98-3\\" saw its best ratings, defeating rival WVKS in the 18-34 demographic. In September 2007, Cumulus management made Tower 98-3 transition once again to focus on Monroe. After that, the ratings had fallen to a minimal presence in Toledo. On October 1, 2010, WTWR became WMIM, \\"Monroe's Best Mix, My 98-3\\", and returned to an AC format. On September 30, 2014, Cumulus announced that 98.3 would flip to Country, joining the \\"Nash Icon\\" network as 98.3 Nash Icon, on October 3 at 5:00pm. The format flanks market leading sister station WKKO.WMIM To Flip To Nash Icon from Radio Insight September 30, 2014 At 11AM that day, after playing \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" by Journey, WMIM dropped its AC format and began stunting by playing a different genre of music every hour as \\"98.3 _____ Icon\\", From 11 to Noon it was classic hits as \\"98.3 Pop Radio Icon\\", from Noon to 1PM '70s music as \\"98.3 Motown Icon\\", from 1PM to 2:00 pm one hit wonders as \\"98.3 One Hit Icon\\", and from 2:00 to 3:00 pm all British bands as \\"98.3 British Icon\\".

A highly popular, acclaimed and influential feature about rambunctious fifth-grader Skippy Skinner, his friends and his enemies, it was adapted into movies, a novel and a radio show. It was commemorated on a 1997 U.S. Postal Service stamp and was the basis for a wide range of merchandising‚Äîalthough perhaps the most well-known product bearing the Skippy name, Skippy peanut butter, used the name without Crosby's authorization, leading to a protracted trademark conflict. An early influence on cartoonist Charles Schulz and an inspiration for his Peanuts, Skippy is considered one of the classics of the form. In Vanity Fair, humorist Corey Ford described it as \\"America's most important contribution to humor of the century\\",Quoted in Skippy: A Complete Compilation 1925-1926, foreword by Bill Blackbeard, Hyperion Press, Westport, Connecticut, 1977. (hardcover), (trade paperback) while comics historian John A. Lent wrote, \\"The first half-century of the comics spawned many kid strips, but only one could be elevated to the status of classic... which innovated a number of sophisticated and refined touches used later by Charles Schulz and Bill Watterson...\\" Comics artist Jerry Robinson said, Skippy started in 1923 as a cartoon in Life and became a syndicated comic strip two years later through King Features Syndicate. Creator Crosby retained the copyright, a rarity for comic strip artists of the time. Characters and story The strip focused on Skippy Skinner, a young boy living in the city. Usually wearing an enormous collar and tie and a floppy checked hat, he was an odd mix of mischief and melancholy who might equally be found stealing from the corner fruit stand, failing to master skates or baseball, complaining about the adult world, or staring sadly at an old relative's grave (\\"And only last year she gave me a tie\\"). The syndicated strip was enormously popular, at one point guaranteeing Crosby $2,350 a week,Robinson, p. 25 more than the United States president. Skippy had several topper strips on the Sunday page: Always Belittlin' (Oct 17, 1926 - 1940), Comic Letter (April 22 - Sept 16, 1934) and Bug Lugs (Feb 17 - Aug 18, 1935). During the World War II years, Crosby's conservative politics increasingly intruded on the strip, and it began to lose readers. Negotiations on a new contract failed, and Crosby ended Skippy in 1945. Crosby's final years were tragic; he was unable to find steady work and drifted into alcoholism. After a 1949 suicide attempt, he was placed in the asylum at Kings Park, New York, where he died in 1964, unable to secure release. In other media Grosset & Dunlap published Crosby's Skippy novel in 1929. There were Skippy dolls, toys and comic books. The strip was adapted as a movie by Paramount. The 1931 comedy film Skippy starring Jackie Cooper was based on the comic strip. It won director Norman Taurog the Academy Award for Best Director and boosted the career of its young star. Crosby disliked the filmRobinson, p. 81 and, though he had to allow the production of a previously contracted sequel, Sooky, released the same year, he never let another Skippy movie be made. Radio dramatist Robert Hardy Andrews wrote the daytime, children's radio serial Skippy, sponsored by General Mills. =Trademark conflict= In the 1930s, the Alameda, California, food packer Rosefield Packing Co., Ltd. began to sell its newly developed hydrogenated peanut butter, which it labeled \\"Skippy\\" without Crosby's permission. Percy Crosby had the trademark invalidated in 1934, but Rosefield persisted after Crosby was committed to an asylum, and its successor companies, including Unilever and Hormel (owner since 2013), were granted rights to the trademark over the objection of Crosby's heirs. Years of expensive litigation followed, which Crosby's heirs have continued into the 2000s. Reprints In 2012, IDW Publishing started a complete reprint series under \\"The Library of American Comics\\", with separate volumes for the daily and Sundays. On September 10, 2012, GoComics also began publishing Skippy dailies online.

Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause applies to freedom of assembly.. The Court found that Dirk De Jonge had the right to speak at a peaceful public meeting held by the Communist Party, even though the party generally advocated industrial or political change in revolution. However, in the 1950s with the fear of communism on the rise, the Court ruled in Dennis v. United States (1951) that Eugene Dennis, who was the leader of the Communist Party, violated the Smith Act by advocating the forcible overthrow of the United States government.. Background Oregon's \\"criminal syndicalism\\" statute made it a crime to, among other things \\"assist in conducting any assemblage of persons ... which teaches or advocates ... the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, sabotage, or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution.\\"De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 356 n.1. The statute was similar to state laws the Court had upheld in cases like Gitlow v. New York (1925) and Whitney v. California (1927). Dirk De Jonge addressed an audience regarding jail conditions in the county and a maritime strike in progress in Portland at a meeting called by the Portland branch of the Communist Party on July 27, 1934. De Jonge was a member of the Party, but the meeting was open to the public and had been publicly advertised as such.De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 358-59. A raid on the meeting was carried out by Portland police. De Jonge was arrested and charged with violating the State's criminal syndicalism statute. Once convicted, De Jonge motioned for an acquittal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to warrant his conviction, since there was no evidence that either De Jonge nor anyone else at the meeting advocated violent acts or revolution. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld his conviction, ruling that the indictment did not charge De Jonge with criminal syndicalism, but rather that he \\"presided at, conducted and assisted in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society and group called by the Communist Party, which was unlawfully teaching and advocating in Multnomah county the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage.\\" In other words, De Jonge was convicted for associating with the Communist Party, which at other times, although not at that meeting, had advocated criminal syndicalism.De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 361. De Jonge took his case to the Supreme Court, arguing that his conviction violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Representation * Osmond K. Fraenkel of New York City for the appellant * Maurice E. Tarshis, Deputy District Attorney of Portland for the State of Oregon.  Supreme Court decision  Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court, which unanimously reversed De Jonge's conviction.The decision was 8-0; Justice Harlan Fiske Stone did not participate. Hughes began by emphasizing the precise questions involved in light of the state court's decision. The Court had to accept the indictment as the state court had defined it, and decide the case on the basis that the law had been properly applied: the Oregon Supreme Court had final authority to interpret Oregon law, and by sustaining the conviction, had held that the indictment was sufficient under the Criminal Syndicalism statute. Given that, the Court could only review the indictment as setting out the substantive offense. It couldn't examine the evidence at trial to determine if De Jonge had done anything more culpable than conduct a public Communist Party meeting, because he wasn't charged with anything else, and \\"Conviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process\\".De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 362. Thus it was irrelevant that De Jonge was, in fact, a member of the Communist Party, and that he encouraged others to join and help the Party at the meeting, since those acts were not necessary to his conviction and anyone else conducting the meeting, whether or not a Party member, could have been prosecuted under the statute. As Hughes explained, \\"[De Jonge's] sole offense as charged, and for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, was that he had assisted in the conduct of a public meeting, albeit otherwise lawful, which was held under the auspices of the Communist Party.... Thus if the Communist Party had called a public meeting in Portland to discuss the tariff, or the foreign policy of the Government, or taxation, or relief, or candidacies for the offices of President, members of Congress, Governor, or state legislators, every speaker who assisted in the conduct of the meeting would be equally guilty\\" of violating the criminal syndicalism act.De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 362-63. With the scope of the case clarified, Hughes next distinguished decisions like Gitlow and Whitney, which had upheld Criminal Syndicalism laws on their face. He pointed out that in those cases, the defendant was convicted of actually advocating the violent overthrow of the Government, or joining a conspiracy to that end and with that intent.De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 363. Hughes explained that despite a number of decisions permitting abridgment of free speech,Decisions like Gitlow and Whitney have since been discredited, with the Court recognizing that they went too far in permitting restrictions of free speech. See . \\"none of our prior decisions go to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application.\\" Hughes proceeded to explain why freedom of assembly is such an important right. In poignant and powerful passages, he explained: > [Freedom of assembly] cannot be denied without violating those fundamental > principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and > political institutions. ... The greater the importance of safeguarding the > community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and > violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the > constitutional rights of free speech, free press, and free assembly in order > to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that > government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if > desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the > Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.DeJonge, 299 U.S. > at 364. For these reasons, the Court held, \\"consistently with the Federal Constitution, peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.\\"De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 365. When a person was charged with unlawfully assisting a group, even a criminal conspiracy like the Communist Party (as the Court assumed), a court had to inquire whether his specific purpose, and his specific actions, aided that unlawful purpose: \\"If the persons assembling have committed crimes elsewhere, if they have formed or are engaged in a conspiracy against the public peace and order, they may be prosecuted for their conspiracy or other violation of valid laws.\\" As Hughes emphasized in finishing his opinion, the Court accepted the finding that the Communist Party was constantly engaged in criminal syndicalism and attempting to overthrow the government, in Multnomah County and elsewhere. But De Jonge nevertheless had a constitutional right \\"to discuss the public issues of the day and thus in a lawful manner, without incitement to violence or crime, to seek redress of alleged grievances. That was of the essence of his guaranteed personal liberty.\\"De Jonge, 299 U.S. at 365-66. De Jonge's conviction was consequently reversed as a violation of the Due Process Clause. Over three decades later, the Supreme Court declared a criminal syndicalism law unconstitutional on its face in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), overruling Whitney and casting serious doubt on Gitlow. Brandenburg reaffirmed the holding of De Jonge that peaceful political assembly is a right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

It serves the Baton Rouge metropolitan area with a contemporary hit format. The studios are located in Baton Rouge, and the transmitter site is in nearby Plaquemine. Dating to the early 1940s, WFMF is one of the oldest FM stations in the United States. It is the Baton Rouge affiliate for: The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show; On Air with Ryan Seacrest; and American Top 40. Besides a standard analog transmission, WFMF is available online via iHeartRadio. History On October 31, 1940 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded the first fifteen commercial FM station construction permits, including one for 44.5 MHz to the Baton Rouge Broadcasting Company. Inc.,\\"New FM Call Letters Proposed\\", Broadcasting, November 15, 1940, page 77. which was issued the call sign W45BR.The initial policy for commercial FM station call signs included an initial \\"W\\" for stations located east of the Mississippi River, followed by the last two digits of a station's frequency assignment, \\"45\\" in this case, and closing with a one or two character city identifier, which for Baton Rouge stations was \\"BR\\" . Baton Rouge Broadcasting was owned by the Manship family, which also owned AM station WJBO and a local newspaper, The Morning Advocate. The new station grants originally allowed for commercial operation to begin on January 1, 1941, however, the owner's newspaper link caused a delay, after the FCC began an investigation as to whether newspaper cross-ownership of radio stations should be restricted.\\"FCC Starts Newspaper Ownership Drive\\", Broadcasting, March 24, 1941, page 7. On May 6, 1941 W45BR was one of three newspaper-affiliated stations given provisional permission, pending the outcome of the newspaper ownership review, to begin operations.\\"Three Newspapers Get FM Stations\\", Broadcasting, May 12, 1941, page 26. After a short period of test transmissions, the station made its debut broadcast as \\"the first frequency modulation radio station in the deep south\\"\\"FM Radio Station Programs to Begin\\" (AP), Monroe Morning World, June 15, 1941, page 23. The first FM station in the upper southern United States was W47NV in Nashville, Tennessee, beginning March 1, 1941. on June 15, 1941.\\"W45BR On Air First Time Today\\", Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, June 15, 1941, pages 1-A, 6-A. Programming was initially advertised as being \\"a different program from WJBO (with a few exceptions)\\", with a daily schedule of 7:00-9:00 a.m., 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m., and 6:00-9:00 p.m.\\"New F. M. Station to Begin Regular Schedule Sunday!\\" (advertisement), Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, June 15, 1941, page 7-B. Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC modified its policy for FM call letters,\\"Standard Broadcast Station Call Letters for All Outlets Starting Nov. 1, FCC Rule\\", The Billboard, September 4, 1943, page 7. and the call sign was changed to WBRL. In 1946, as part of reassignment of all stations to a new FM band allocation, WBRL was moved to 96.1 MHz, and two years later it moved again to 98.1 MHz. In 1959, WBRL's call letters changed to WJBO-FM, still simulcasting WJBO. In the mid-1960s, the station started broadcasting in FM stereo, and started offering classical music and some musical programs independent of WJBO. In 1965, WJBO-FM moved to 102.5 MHz, allowing WAFB-FM (now WDGL-FM), a companion station to Channel 9 WAFB-TV, to move from 104.3 MHz to the vacated 98.1 MHz assignment. In the late 60s and into the mid-70s, WJBO-FM was a freeform progressive rock station that went by the name \\"Loose Radio.\\" In 1974, WJBO-FM switched its call sign to WFMF and shifted to a personality driven full-service Top 40 format under Program Director Randy Rice and became one of the most successful FM-Top 40/CHR stations in the United States (Arbitron Ratings market share). WFMF remained a top 40 station throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. It used the monikers \\"102 WFMF,\\" \\"Hot 102,\\" and \\"Mix 102.5\\" for a short time in 1994 before reverting to \\"102.5 WFMF.\\" Throughout its history as a Top 40, the station had shifted its musical directions, to Rhythmic, Adult-leaning and Alternative, but in each case returned to a mainstream playlist. In 1989, the Manship family sold WFMF and WJBO to station manager George Jenne, who moved the stations' studios to Government Street. In 1996, WJBO and WFMF were sold by George Jenne/Capital City Communications to Capstar Broadcasting (under the name Gulfstar). Capstar immediately shifted WFMF from Top 40 to Modern AC as \\"Loose 102\\" under the new call letters WLSS. The change turned out to be a ratings disaster and after lasting only half a year as a Modern AC, WLSS went back to Top 40 in February 1997, using the name \\"Loose 102-5\\" at first. Then it simply called itself \\"102.5\\" in early 1999. On October 7, 1999, WFMF returned as the call sign and the name \\"102.5 WFMF\\" was resurrected a short time later. Since being bought by Capstar, WFMF has been through several owners as a result of buyouts. Capstar was purchased by Chancellor Media in 1998 (and renamed AMFM Communications), which in turn was purchased by Clear Channel Communications in 2000. In 2014, Clear Channel switched its name to iHeartMedia, Inc.

Composed of quartz sand, calcined gypsum, lime, cement, water and aluminum powder, AAC products are cured under heat and pressure in an autoclave. Invented in the mid-1920s, AAC simultaneously provides structure, insulation, and fire- and mold-resistance. Forms include blocks, wall panels, floor and roof panels, cladding (fa√ßade) panels and lintels. AAC products may be used for both interior and exterior construction, and may be painted or coated with a stucco or plaster compound to guard against the elements, or covered with siding materials such as veneer brick or vinyl siding. In addition to their quick and easy installation, ACC materials can be routed, sanded, or cut to size on site using standard power tools with carbon steel cutters. Etymology Other names for the product include autoclaved cellular concrete (ACC), autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC), autoclaved concrete, cellular concrete, porous concrete, Aircrete, Thermalite, Hebel Block, Starken, Siporex, and Ytong. History AAC was perfected in the mid-1920s by the Swedish architect and inventor Dr. Johan Axel Eriksson,Swedish Association of Historical Buildings: Pioneering work in the early days of concrete - history 1890‚Äì1950 (from Byggnadskultur issue 4/2004) working with Professor Henrik Kre√ºger at the Royal Institute of Technology. The process was patented in 1924. In 1929, production started in Sweden at the city of Yxhult. From \\"Yxhults √Öngh√§rdade Gasbetong\\" later became the first registered building materials brand in the world: Ytong. Another brand ‚ÄúSiporex‚Äù was established in Sweden in 1939 and presently licences and owns plants in 35 locations around the world. The second major international cellular concrete Hebel brand goes back to company founder and technicians Josef Hebel from Memmingen. In 1943, the first Hebel-plant was opened in Germany. Originally Ytong autoclaved aerated concrete in Sweden was produced with alum shale, whose combustible carbon content was beneficial in the production process. Unfortunately, the slate deposits used for Ytong in Sweden also contain a very low level of natural uranium, which makes the material give off radioactive radon gas in the building. In 1972, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority pointed out the unsuitability of a radon-emitting construction material, and the use of alum slate in the production of Ytong ceased in 1975. By using new formulations, containing only quartz sand, calcined gypsum, lime (mineral), cement, water and aluminum powder, Ytong produced a new type of aerated concrete which no longer contains alum slate and thus has eliminated the problem of radon exposure from this raw material. The production of this white autoclaved aerated concrete is now state of the art and similar formulations are used by all producers around the world. In 1978 The Swedish team of Siporex Sweden opened the Siporex Factory in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - the \\"Lightweight Construction Company - Siporex - LCC SIPOREX\\" which have supplied the Middle-East and Africa and Japan by most of its need. The LCC SIPOREX FACTORY has operated for more than 40 years. Today aerated concrete is produced by many companies, particularly in Europe and Asia. There is some production in the Americas and in Africa, there is one plant in Egypt. AAC production in Europe has slowed down considerably, but the industry is growing rapidly in Asia due to strong demand in housing and commercial space. China is now the largest aircrete market in the world with several hundred factories. China, Central Asia, India, and the Middle-East are the biggest in terms of AAC manufacturing and consumption. The product aircrete is sold, like other masonry materials, under many different brand names. Ytong and Hebel are brands of the international operating company Xella headquartered in Duisburg. Other more internationally renowned brand names in Europe are H + H Celcon (Denmark), or Solbet (Poland). Uses AAC is a highly thermally insulating concrete-based material used for both interior and exterior construction. Besides AAC's insulating capability, one of its advantages is quick and easy installation, because the material can be routed, sanded, or cut to size on site using standard power tools with carbon steel cutters. AAC is well suited for high-rise buildings and those with high temperature variations. Due to its lower density, high-rise buildings constructed using AAC require less steel and concrete for structural members. The mortar needed for laying of AAC blocks is reduced due to the lower number of joints. Similarly, the material required for rendering is also lower due to the dimensional accuracy of AAC. The increased thermal efficiency of AAC makes it suitable for use in areas with extreme temperatures, as it eliminates the need for separate materials for construction and insulation, leading to faster construction and cost savings. Even though regular cement mortar can be used, most of the buildings erected with AAC materials use thin bed mortar in thicknesses around ‚Öõ inch, depending on the national building codes. AAC materials can be coated with a stucco or plaster compound to guard against the elements, or covered with siding materials such as brick or vinyl. Manufacturing Unlike most other concrete applications, AAC is produced using no aggregate larger than sand. Quartz sand, calcined gypsum, lime (mineral) and/or cement and water are used as a binding agent. Aluminum powder is used at a rate of 0.05%‚Äì0.08% by volume (depending on the pre-specified density). In some countries, like India and China, fly ash generated from coal fire power plants and having 50-65% silica content is used as an aggregate. When AAC is mixed and cast in forms, several chemical reactions take place that gives AAC its light weight (20% of the weight of concrete) and thermal properties. Aluminum powder reacts with calcium hydroxide and water to form hydrogen. The hydrogen gas foams and doubles the volume of the raw mix creating gas bubbles up to 3mm (‚Öõ inch) in diameter. At the end of the foaming process, the hydrogen escapes into the atmosphere and is replaced by air. When the forms are removed from the material, it is solid but still soft. It is then cut into either blocks or panels, and placed in an autoclave chamber for 12 hours. During this steam pressure hardening process, when the temperature reaches 190¬∞ Celsius (374¬∞ Fahrenheit) and the pressure reaches 8 to 12 bar, quartz sand reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium silicate hydrate, which gives AAC its high strength and other unique properties. Because of the relatively low temperature used AAC blocks are not considered fired brick but a lightweight concrete masonry unit. After the autoclaving process, the material is ready for immediate use on the construction site. Depending on its density, up to 80% of the volume of an AAC block is air. AAC's low density also accounts for its low structural compression strength. It can carry loads of up to 8 MPa (1,160 PSI), approximately 50% of the compressive strength of regular concrete. In 1978, the first AAC material was opened in the Persian Gulf state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - LCC SIPOREX- Lightweight Construction Company supplying the GCC countries with the Aerated products of blocks and panels. Since 1980, there has been a worldwide increase in the use of AAC materials. New production plants are being built in Australia, Bahrain, China, Eastern Europe, India, and the United States. AAC is increasingly used by developers, architects, and home builders worldwide. Advantages AAC has been produced for more than 70 years, and it offers several advantages over other cement construction materials, one of the most important being its lower environmental impact. * Improved thermal efficiency reduces the heating and cooling load in buildings. * Porous structure gives superior fire resistance. * Workability allows accurate cutting, which minimizes the generation of solid waste during use. * Resource efficiency gives it lower environmental impact in all phases of its life cycle, from the processing of raw materials to the disposal of waste. * Lightweight saves cost and energy in transportation, labour expenses, and increases chances of survival during seismic activity. * Larger size blocks leads to faster masonry work. * Reduces project cost for large constructions. *Environmentally friendly: It produces at least 30% less solid waste than traditional concrete. There is a decrease of 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. *Fire resistant: As with regular concrete, AAC is fire resistant. *Great ventilation: This material is very airy and allows diffusion of water. This reduces the humidity inside the building. AAC will absorb moisture and release humidity. This helps to prevent condensation and other problems that are related to mildew. *Non-toxic: There are no toxic gases or other toxic substances in autoclaved aerated concrete. It neither attracts rodents or other pests nor can it be damaged by such. *Accuracy: The panels and blocks made of autoclaved aerated concrete are produced to the exact sizes needed before leaving the factory. There is less need for on-site trimming. Since the blocks and panels fit so well together, there is less use of finishing materials such as mortar. *Long lasting: The life of this material is extended because it is not affected by harsh climates or extreme weather changes. It will not degrade under normal climate changes. Disadvantages AAC has been produced for more than 70 years, however, some disadvantages were found when it was introduced in the UK (where cavity wall with clay brick two-skin construction has been the norm). *Installation during rainy weather: AAC is known to crack after installation, which can be avoided by reducing the strength of the mortar and ensuring the blocks are dry during and after installation. *Brittle nature: they need to be handled more carefully than clay bricks to avoid breakage. *Attachments: the brittle nature of the blocks requires longer, thinner screws when fitting cabinets and wall hangings and wood-suitable drill bits or hammering in. Special, large diameter wall plugs (anchors) are available at a higher cost than common wall plugs. *Insulation requirements in newer building codes of northern European countries would require very thick walls when using AAC alone. Thus many builders choose to use traditional building methods installing an extra layer of insulation around the entire building.

Within the narrative of the fictional DC Universe, Hero is a portrayal of a Latino gay superhero of African descent. He first appeared in Superboy and the Ravers (September 1996) and was created by Karl Kesel and Steve Mattsson. According to Richard T. Rodr√≠guez in Graphic Borders, Hero is an updated take on the concept of a gay superhero: \\"Unlike the earlier, effeminate characterization of Extra√±o nine years before, Hero Cruz was fashioned as a character who was unmistakably masculine and who didn't wear his homosexuality on his sleeve\\".  Fictional character biography  Hero (his actual name, which is Greek) first appeared as a member the superhero team The Ravers founded by Superboy. He was a frequent regular of the Event Horizon, an intergalactic rave that featured hipsters and partiers from all over the galaxy. Though at first it was unclear what, if any, powers he possessed, it became apparent that his vest (later revealed to be the \\"Achilles Vest\\") emitted a force field that protected him from most forms of physical assault. He was somehow able to steal this from the lair of the Scavenger, a villainous packrat who stockpiles various items and gadgets from the DC Comics universe. Hero eventually lost his vest, but found the even more interesting \\"H-Dial\\" (of Dial H for Hero fame), and soon realized that by spelling H-E-R-O on its dial, he would be granted the powers of and persona of one of several superheroes, supposedly merging with them using hypertime. Since acquiring this device, Hero has taken on the roles of heroes like BadAxe (an axe- wielding warrior), and Human Justice (a powerful, deity-like figure). Later in the series, he would become the muscular Titanic in order to impress his female teammate Sparx. While at first it seemed like the beginning of a relationship, Hero became more and more distant from her, eventually avoiding her altogether. It wasn't until they took a trip to Sparx's family ranch in Canada that he finally admitted that he was gay. For a time, Hero is the companion of the long-lived sentient canine Rex the Wonder Dog, whom he implies had been found in some sort of metal container. Near the end of the Ravers series, Sparx began to lose her powers, and in frustration told Hero that she not only didn't want to be his friend any more, but what he was doing was \\"not natural\\" and \\"wrong\\". Hero has since been in a relationship with the alien Leander and has decided to keep tabs on everyone else in \\"The Rave\\". Hero was also an associate of Titans L.A. in The Titans. Powers and abilities The H-Dial (Hero Dial) gives Hero the ability to turn into any of a number of superheroes. The extent of this power is unknown, yet it appears to utilize hypertime. Among the hero forms he has used are: * Badaxe * Human Justice * Stormfront * Titanic * Feathered Serpent * Hot Head * Death's Head Moth * Ferronaut * Captain Elastic * Diamond Lord * Isis * Radio Ranger * Faust * Caduceus the Healer * Viridian Paladin * Port References Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996 Category:DC Comics LGBT superheroes Category:Fictional gay males Category:Characters created by Karl Kesel ","title":"Hero Cruz"},{"id":"2624276","text":"Abdur Rahman Biswas (1 September 1926 - 3 November 2017) was a Bangladeshi politician. He was the President of Bangladesh from 1991 to 1996. Biswas represented Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly prior to the independence of Bangladesh. Early life and education Biswas was born in Shaistabad village, Barisal District. He was educated at the University of Dhaka, where he received BA with honours and an MA in history and a degree in law. His subsequent public service included chairing a local cooperative bank and sponsoring educational initiatives. He joined the legal profession in the 1950s. He was elected president of the Barisal Bar Association twice in the 1970s and worked as a Supreme Court lawyer. Political career Biswas started his political career when he joined the Muslim League during Ayub Khan's regime. He was elected as a representative to the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly in 1962 and 1965. In 1967, he represented Pakistan at the UN General Assembly. He became chairman of Barisal Municipality in 1977. He became a member of parliament in the 1979 Bangladeshi general election. He served as minister of textiles and jute under the cabinet of President Ziaur Rahman, and later as health minister under President Abdus Sattar. He served as a vice-chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He elected as a member of parliament in the 1991 election and soon after got selected as the Speaker of the Parliament. He became Bangladesh's 16th president on 10 September the same year. President of Bangladesh For most of his tenure as President, Biswas spent his time reading and meeting dignitaries including Nobel laureate physicist Abdus Salam, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Nepal, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the King of Bhutan and the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohamad. As head of the Caretaker government of Bangladesh, however, he faced challenges from the military and political instability in the country. = February 1996 election = From mid-1994, clashes between the BNP backed Jatioabadi Chhatra Dal and Awami League backed Bangladesh Chhatra League led to increasing violence in the form of bomb and arson attacks on party bureaus, newspaper offices and government buildings. In the midst of violence, the opposition led by the Awami League's Sheikh Hasina, pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996. When Khaleda Zia's BNP was re-elected for the second term in that election, it was boycotted and denounced by the three main opposition parties. On 26 March, in the face of increasing opposition, the newly elected parliament enacted the thirteenth constitutional amendment bill paving the way for the appointment of an interim caretaker government. = June 1996 election = On 28 March 1996, Biswas signed the Caretaker Government bill into law, which was welcomed by human rights organisations. As a result, Biswas dissolved the newly elected legislature and, as Khaleda Zia stepped down, while appointed former Chief Justice Habibur Rahman was appointed as chief adviser to head an interim government that was poised to preside over fresh national elections on 12 June 1996. =1996 coup= On 19 May 1996, Biswas, as head of a caretaker government, ordered the army chief Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim to force the retirement of Major-General Morshed Khan, commander of Bogra Cantonment, and Brigadier Miron Hamidur Rahman, deputy chief of paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles. Both officers had issued statements expressing dissatisfaction with the country's situation. The President believed that they were involved in political activities with opposition parties. Nasim refused to comply. The next day, Biswas sacked him and sent soldiers to control the state radio and television stations. On noon that day, Nasim ordered soldiers of Bogra, Jessore and Mymensingh divisions to march towards Dhaka. The Ninth Infantry Division's Major General Imamuzzaman, who commanded the division located closest to Dhaka, remained loyal to the President. He directed the removal of all boats and ferries from Jamuna River in Aricha port, so that Bogra and Jessore divisions could not cross the river. Biswas sent a contingent of troops with tanks to blockade the Dhaka-Mymenshing highway. This prevented Mymensing Division Army from entering Dhaka. In the meantime, Major General Mohammad Anwar Hossain, General Officer Commanding of the 33rd Infantry Division located in Comilla, also came to the aid of the president. He mobilised a fully geared 101 Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Shah Ikram (later Major General) to Dhaka to fortify Bangabhaban, the presidential palace. The 33rd Division was deployed, using an Infantry Battalion and a company of tanks from the 7th Horse Armoured Battalion at the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, to create a blockade against the 24th Infantry Division located in Chittagong. The government broadcast announcements asking all soldiers to stay at their own cantonment. After some hours, Mymensingh Division soldiers returned to their barracks. The Chittagong Division never mobilised towards Dhaka. The General Officer Commanding of the Chittagong Division realised that the military coup was highly unlikely to succeed. That night Nasim was interviewed by the BBC and, in reference to troop movements, he said that as Army Chief, he could move troops anytime he wanted. Nasim was arrested by the Brigade Commander of 14 Independent Engineers Brigade and put under house arrest in the Army Mess behind Army Central Library, Staff road, Dhaka Cantonment. Later the Awami League government, which was elected to power in 1996, granted him a formal retirement. Biswas later recalled the events as his \\"most memonrable experience.\\" He stepped down as president on 9 October 1996 and was succeeded by Shahabuddin Ahmed. Personal life Biswas was married to Hosne Ara Rahman (1936 ‚Äì 17 June 2017)http://bangladeshnewsgazette.com/former-president-abdur-rahman-biswass- wife-passes-away/ a cousin of politician Rashed Khan Menon. Together they had five sons Monu Biswas, Ehteshamul Haque Nasim (d. 1998), Shamsuddoza Kamal Biswas, Jamilur Rahman Shibli Biswas, and Muidur Rahman Romel Biswas, and two daughters Akhi Biswas and Rakhi Biswas. Later life After the end of his presidency, Biswas retired permanently from politics. In 2006, during the unfolding crisis, Biswas's house in Barisal was set on fire by Awami League activists. Biswas died on 3 November 2017 at United Hospital, Dhaka from respiratory problems, aged 91. He was buried in Banani Graveyard on 4 November.

It is the largest circulating daily newspaper in Nevada and one of two daily newspapers in the Las Vegas area. It is ranked as one of the top 25 newspapers in the United States by circulation. The Review-Journal has a joint operating agreement with The Greenspun Corporation-owned Las Vegas Sun, which runs through 2040. In 2005, the Sun ceased afternoon publication and began distribution as a section of the Review-Journal. On March 18, 2015, the sale of the newspaper's parent company, Stephens Media LLC, to New Media Investment Group was completed. In December 2015, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson purchased the newspaper for $140 million via News + Media Capital Group LLC, although a subsidiary of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse Media, was retained to manage the newspaper. $140 million was considered a steep price amounting to a 69% gain for New Media Investment Group after owning the newspaper for nine months. History The Clark County Review was first printed in 1909 and became the Las Vegas Review in 1926 when owner Frank Garside, who owned several other Nevada papers, brought in Al Cahlan as a partner. In March 1929, the Clark County Journal began publication, and in July of that year, the Review bought the Journal and shortly thereafter began co-publication as the Las Vegas Evening Review-Journal. In the early 1940s, Cahlan and Garside's company, Southwestern Publishing, bought the Las Vegas Age, from Charles P. \\"Pop\\" Squires, which began publication in 1905 and was the oldest surviving paper in Las Vegas. The word \\"evening\\" was dropped from the name in 1949 when Garside left the company and Cahlan struck an agreement with Donald W. Reynolds and his Donrey Media Group. In 1953, the RJ signed on KORK, one of Las Vegas' earliest radio stations. Two years later, it signed on Las Vegas' third television station, KLRJ-TV, in 1955, later changing the calls to KORK-TV. The station was sold in 1979, changing its call letters again first to KVBC, and then, in 2010, to the current KSNV-DT. In December 1960, Reynolds exercised a buyout option with Cahlan, and bought the paper. Reynolds died in 1993, and longtime friend Jack Stephens bought his company, renamed it Stephens Media and moved the company's headquarters to Las Vegas. The Review-Journal entered into its first Joint Operating Agreement, or JOA, with the Sun in 1990, which was amended in 2005. In early 2015, the Stephens Media newspapers were sold to New Media Investment Group. The current Review- Journal headquarters was built in 1971. A new $40 million printing press was installed in 2000 as part of a four-year, 152,000-square-foot expansion project. The two printing presses weigh 910 tons and consist of 16 towers. They were the largest presses in the world when they were installed. The newspaper has won the \\"General Excellence\\" award from the Nevada Press Association several times and has also won the \\"Freedom of the Press\\" award for its First Amendment battles from the statewide organization. =Sheldon Adelson ownership= When the paper was sold in 2015, it was initially unclear who the buyer was. The purchaser was a limited liability company, News + Media Capital Group LLC, and the only name listed on the documents was Michael Schroeder, a publisher of four small regional newspapers in Connecticut. At a December 10 staff meeting informing the Review-Journal staff that the paper had been sold, Schroeder was introduced as the manager. He refused to say who the owners of News + Media were, saying that employees should \\"focus on [their] jobs...and don't worry about who [the owners] are.\\" Jason Taylor, the Review-Journal's publisher, said only that the ownership included \\"multiple owner/investors, that some are from Las Vegas, and that in face-to-face meetings he has been assured that the group will not meddle in the newspaper‚Äôs editorial content.‚Äù There were widespread rumors that the primary buyer was Sheldon Adelson, and a week later three Review-Journal reporters confirmed that the purchase had been orchestrated by Adelson's son-in-law Patrick Dumont on Adelson's behalf. A month before the new owner was revealed, three reporters at the newspaper received an assignment from corporate management: Spend two weeks monitoring the activity of three Clark County judges. One of the judges was District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez, who was hearing a long- running wrongful termination lawsuit filed against Adelson and his company, a lawsuit alleging that Adelson's Macao casino, Sands Macao, was connected to the Chinese Triads. In January a set of editorial principles were drawn up and publicized to ensure the newspaper's independence and to deal with possible conflicts of interest involving Adelson's ownership. In February Craig Moon, a veteran of the Gannett organization, was announced as the new publisher and promptly withdrew those principles from publication. He also began to personally review, edit, and sometimes kill stories about an Adelson-promoted proposal for the future Las Vegas Raiders football stadium. In the months since, reporters say that stories about Adelson, and particularly about an ongoing lawsuit involving his business dealings in Macau, have been heavily edited by top management. The new ownership triggered numerous departures. On December 23 the paper's editor Mike Hengel stepped down in a \\"voluntary buyout\\". Many reporters and editors left the newspaper citing \\"curtailed editorial freedom, murky business dealings and unethical managers.\\" Longtime columnist John L. Smith resigned after he was told he could no longer write anything about Adelson, a frequent focus of his reporting up till then. Within six months, all three of the reporters who broke the story of Adelson's ownership had left the paper. Other publications The Review-Journal is responsible for several other niche publications: * El Tiempo ‚Äì a free weekly Spanish language paper distributed around the Las Vegas area * Neon ‚Äì a weekend publication distributed through the Review-Journal that covers music, movies, arts and dining * Luxury Las Vegas ‚Äì a monthly high-end lifestyle magazine established in 2003 focusing on fashion, food, and home trends The Review-Journal also operates several Nevada newspapers: * Boulder City Review ‚Äì A weekly paper that debuted Oct. 29, 2009. The print edition is distributed on Thursday mornings. * Pahrump Valley Times ‚Äì A bi-weekly newspaper. The print edition is distributed on Wednesday and Friday mornings. * Tonopah Times-Bonanza & Goldfield News ‚Äì Serving communities in Nye and Esmeralda counties since 1901. Website and video Las Vegas Review-Journal launched its website as LVRJ.com on Jan. 15, 1997. By the end of the year, it was recognized as one of the top online papers in the U.S. by the Internet Job Source. The Review-Journal also operated LasVegas.com as a general information site. LVRJ.com was redesigned in 2000 and the site was rebranded as Reviewjournal.com two years later. In 2012, the RJ launched its first apps for iPhone, Android, and iPad. A major online redesign launched in April 2017 with an emphasis on video. The RJ built a studio on its downtown campus to produce high-end live and on-demand videos for news, politics and sports. Programs include: * Reporter Roundtable ‚Äì Interviews and panel discussions with reporters covering major stories * Vegas Nation ‚Äì Coverage of Raiders football * Golden Edge ‚Äì Coverage of the Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey team * Covering the Cage ‚Äì UFC and MMA coverage * Nevada Politics Today * Sports Betting Spotlight In addition to delivering its shows on the Review-Journal website, the Review-Journal launched a Roku app in early 2018. Accolades In 2018, Editor and Publisher magazine named the Review-Journal as one of 10 newspapers in the United States on the magazine's annual list of \\"10 Newspapers That Do It Right\\". Controversy In 1998, the newspaper killed a story about casino mogul Steve Wynn's sexual harassment of employees. The newspaper reported about the axed story in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal published a story in which dozens of people alleged that they had been victims of sexual misconduct by Wynn. =Copyright infringement litigation= Las Vegas Review-Journal sign In 2010, the Review-Journal's then-owner Stephens Media launched a copyright enforcement company called Righthaven LLC, which began a series of legal suits claiming copyright infringements. The company's practice was to search the internet for uses of Review-Journal material, purchase the copyright for that material from the newspaper and then file suit for copyright infringement. According to the Wall Street Journal, \\"Defendants typically get no warning, no take-down request, just a suit.\\" Between March and August 2010, Righthaven LLC filed copyright infringement suits against 107 blogs, political forums, major political parties, and several of the newspaper's own sources including NORML, DailyPaul.com, Infowars, Free Republic and others. In September 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, together with other pro bono attorneys, filed an Answer and Counterclaim on behalf of Democratic Underground, a political website that Righthaven sued after a Democratic Underground member posted a five-sentence excerpt from a Review-Journal article.Copy of the \\"Answer and Counterclaim\\" available at EFF.org Counterclaims were asserted against Stephens Media as well as Righthaven. The pleading alleged a \\"sham relationship\\" between the newspaper and Righthaven, and accused Righthaven of copyright fraud. In March 2011, a federal judge dismissed a suit brought by Righthaven, stating that no evidence had been presented that the forum posting of a Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial for 40 days for noncommercial use harmed the market value of the work. In June 2011, another federal judge ruled that Righthaven had no standing to sue for copyright infringement, on the grounds that the original parties retain the actual copyrights. In August 2011 another case was dismissed by Federal judge Philip Pro, who found that Righthaven had no standing to sue, and in any case the defendant's posting of a Review-Journal editorial to a blog was protected by fair use. The next month the Review- Journal terminated its arrangement with Righthaven, which was forced into receivership in November 2011 because of unpaid legal settlements.

History Elementary school next to church. The parish was formed in 1896 in response to a population explosion in the northern parts of Dubuque. Sacred Heart Church had been established in 1879, and a new large church capable of seating 1,100 was built in 1888. But within a few years church officials realized that even with a new building that Sacred Heart wasn't able to keep up with the growing population. In response Holy Ghost parish was formed. A combination church and school structure was built at the 2900th block of what today is known as Central Avenue. Within a few years a large church building designed by Guido Beck was built just to the north of the old building. In July 2001, Wahlert High School and all Dubuque Catholic Elementary Schools and the Catholic Early Childhood Centers, joined to become a system called Holy Family Catholic Schools. This resulted in the consolidation of and closure of several long time schools, including Holy Trinity, Nativity, Sacred Heart, St. Joseph Key West, St. Joseph The Worker, St. Mary's, and St. Patrick's.

The site is preserved as Rock Creek Station State Historical Park. History Rock Creek Station was established in 1857 by S.C. Glenn along the Oregon Trail and California Trail, along the west bank of Rock Creek. The station was a supply center and campground for emigrants. In March 1859, the property was purchased by David McCanles and his brother, James, who added a toll bridge across Rock Creek, charging each wagon from 10¬¢ to 50¬¢ to cross the bridge depending upon their ability to pay. In 1860, McCanles built a cabin and dug a well on the east side of Rock Creek which became known as the East Ranch. In early 1861, McCanles sold the East Ranch to the Russell, Waddell, and Majors firm, which owned and operated the Pony Express, for a cash deposit with the remainder to be paid in installments. The West Ranch continued to be used as an emigrant rest stop and the home of the McCanles family until April 1861, when McCanles sold the West Ranch to freighters Hagenstein and Wolfe and moved his family to another property three miles south of Rock Creek Station. In July 1861, David McCanles stopped by Rock Creek Station to inquire about the status of an overdue installment. An argument ensued, and McCanles was shot and killed by a young James Butler Hickok, who later became known as Wild Bill Hickok. State park In 1980, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission began development of as a state historical park; an adjoining tract was developed as a state recreation area. Deep trail ruts can be seen in the park complex. The toll bridge and many of the station's buildings have been reconstructed; other features include a visitor center with exhibits about pioneers along the Oregon trail and Wild Bill Hickok, hiking trails, and a campground.

Lenski is best known for his still ongoing -year-old long-term E. coli evolution experiment, which has been instrumental in understanding the core processes of evolution, including mutation rates, clonal interference, antibiotic resistance, the evolution of novel traits, and speciation. He is also well known for his pioneering work in studying evolution digitally using self-replicating organisms called Avida. Early life Richard E. Lenski is the son of sociologist Gerhard Lenski and poet Jean Lenski ( Cappelmann). He is also the great-nephew of children's author Lois Lenski and the great-grandson of Lutheran commentator Richard C. H. Lenski. He earned his BA from Oberlin College in 1976, and his PhD from the University of North Carolina in 1982. Career Lenski won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1991 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1996, and in 2006 he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. United States National Academy of Sciences member list, \\"Member directory\\", Richard E. Lenski , 2006 Lenski is a fellow at the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and holds the office Hannah Distinguished Professor of microbial ecology at Michigan State University. On February 17, 2010, he co-founded the NSF Science and Technology Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, known as the BEACON Center. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018. =E. coli experiment= The 12 evolving E. coli populations on June 25, 2008 The E. coli long-term evolution experiment is an ongoing study in experimental evolution led by Richard Lenski that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual Escherichia coli bacteria since 24 February 1988. The populations reached the milestone of 50,000 generations . Since the experiment's inception, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of genetic changes; some evolutionary adaptations have occurred in all 12 populations, while others have only appeared in one or a few populations. One particularly striking adaptation was the evolution of a strain of E. coli that was able to use citrate as a carbon source in an aerobic environment. =Avida simulation= Richard Lenski, Charles Ofria, et al. at Michigan State University developed an artificial life computer program with the ability to detail the evolution of complex systems. The system uses values set to determine random mutations and allows for the effect of natural selection to conserve beneficial traits. The program was dubbed Avida and starts with an artificial petri dish where organisms reproduce and perform mathematical calculations to acquire rewards of more computer time for replication. The program randomly adds mutations to copies of the artificial organisms to allow for natural selection. As the artificial life reproduced, different lines adapted and evolved depending on their set environments. The beneficial side to the program is that it parallels that of real life at rapid speeds. =Media= In August 2013, having been inspired by a presentation by Titus Brown on the role of social media in science, Lenski began blogging at Telliamed Revisited and tweeting as @RELenski. Lenski's research has received considerable attention, including lengthy discussion in Carl Zimmer's book on E. coli, Microcosm, and in Richard Dawkins' book on the evidence for evolution, The Greatest Show on Earth. Included in Dawkins' discussion was a description of the dialog Lenski had in 2008 with Andrew Schlafly, creator of Conservapedia, which Schlafly initiated as a reaction to reports of Lenski's description of the evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one of the long-term evolution experiment populations. These same findings were later cited by the creationist Ken Ham in a debate over evolution with Bill Nye.

He was a student of Petrus Apianus and was known as the teacher who most influenced Kepler. Maestlin was considered to be one of the most significant astronomers between the time of Copernicus and Kepler.  Early Life and Family  Maestlin was born on September 30, 1550 in G√∂ppingen, a small town in Southern Germany, about 50 kilometers east of T√ºbingen. The son of Jakob Maestlin and Dorothea Simon, Michael Maestlin was born into a Protestant family. Maestlin had an older sister named Elisabeth and a younger brother named Matth√§us. The original family name of the Maestlin was Leckher or Legecker and they lived in the village of Boll, just a few kilometers south of G√∂ppingen (Decker 103). In his autobiography, Maestlin recounts how the family name of Legecker became M√§stlin. He claims that one of his ancestors was given this as a nickname when an old blind woman touched him and exclaimed ‚ÄúWie bist du doch so mast und feist! Du bist ein rechter M√§stlin!‚Äù This roughly translates to ‚ÄúHow are you so large and plump? You rightly are a fatso!\\" Maestlin married Margarete Gr√ºniger on 9 April 1577. There is little information on his children from this marriage. However, it is known that he had at least three sons, Ludwig, Michael and Johann Georg, and at least three daughters, Margareta, Dorothea Ursula and Anna Maria. In 1588, Margarete died at the age of 37, potentially due to complications from child birth. This untimely death left several children under Maestlin's care and could have influenced his decision to remarry the following year. In 1589, Maestlin married Margarete Burkhardt. Maestlin and Burkhardt had eight children together. In a 1589 letter to Johannes Kepler, Maestlin recounts how the death of his month-old son, August, deeply troubled him.  Education  In 1565, when Michael was around 15 years old, he was sent to the nearby Klosterschule in K√∂nigbronn. In 1567, Michael transferred to a similar school in Herrenalb. Upon finishing his education at Herrenalb, Maestlin enrolled in university, matriculating on 3 December 1568 at the University of T√ºbingen. When Maestlin entered the university in 1569 he did so as one of the beneficiaries of a scholarship from the duke of W√ºrttemberg.Methuen, C. (1996). Maestlin's Teaching of Copernicus: The Evidence of His University Textbook and Disputations. Isis, 87(2), 230-247. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/236062 He studied theology at the T√ºbinger Stift, which was founded in 1536 by Duke Ulrich von W√ºrttemberg, and was regarded as an elite institution of education.Michael M√§stlin. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.uni-online.de/personen/michael-maestlin/. He obtained his Baccalaureate in 1569 and his master's degree in 1571. After receiving his masters degree Maestlin remained at the university as a student in theology and as a tutor in the theological seminary church located in W√ºrttemberg. In letters sent to Maestlin regarding his qualifications, it was revealed that he graduated summa cum laude and ranked third in his graduating class of twenty. During the time he spent on earning his master's degree, Maestlin studied under Philipp Apian. It is not certain, but it is believed that Apian taught courses on Frisius's Arithmetic, Euclid's Elements, Proclus's Sphera, Peurbach's Theoricae Novae Planetarus, and the proper use of geodetic instruments. Apian's teachings evidently influenced Maestlin's paper on sundials as the contents of this essay involve elements of structured celestial globes and maps. In 1584, Maestlin was named Professor of Mathematics at T√ºbingen. He was elected Dean of the Arts Faculty for the following terms: 1588-89, 1594‚Äì95, 1600‚Äì01, 1607‚Äì09, 1610‚Äì11, 1615, 1623, and 1629. Maestlin taught trigonometry and astronomy. It was very likely that he used his book Epitome Astronomiae in his lectures. In 1576 Maestlin had been sent to be a deacon at the Lutheran church in Backnang, a town about 30 kilometers Northwest of G√∂ppingen. While there, he observed a comet that appeared in 1577. Tycho Brahe in Denmark observed the same comet, and from observations of its parallax, both Tycho and Maestlin were able to determine that the comet must be above the moon, contrary to the astronomical theories of both Aristotle and Ptolemy. Maestlin concluded that, in the Copernica system, the comet must lie in a region between the sphere of Venus and that of the Earth and Moon.Barker, P. (2002). Constructing Copernicus. Perspectives on Science 10(2), 208‚Äì227. https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/39052. Maestlin served as the Duke's chief scientific adviser from 1577-1580. Career Maestlin studied theology, mathematics, and astronomy/astrology at the University of T√ºbingen‚Äîthe T√ºbinger Stift. (T√ºbingen was part of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg.) He graduated as magister in 1571 and became in 1576 a Lutheran deacon in Backnang, continuing his studies there. In 1580 he became a professor of mathematics, first at the University of Heidelberg, then at the University of T√ºbingen, where he taught for 47 years from 1583. In 1582 Maestlin wrote a popular introduction to astronomy. While teaching at the university Maetslin tho a Copernican taught traditional Ptolemaic astronomy in his courses. However, Maestlin did present Copernican's heliocentric astronomy to his advanced students.Barker, P., & Goldstein, B. (2001). Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy. Osiris, 16, 88‚Äì113. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/301981 Among his students was Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630) who considered Maestlin not only a teacher, but also a lifelong mentor. Although he primarily taught the traditional geocentric Ptolemaic view of the solar system, Maestlin was also one of the first to accept and teach the heliocentric Copernican view. Maestlin corresponded with Kepler frequently and played a sizable part in his adoption of the Copernican system. Galileo Galilei's adoption of heliocentrism was also attributed to Maestlin.Smolka, Josef: Michael M√§stlin and Galileo Galilei. (German Title: Michael M√§stlin und Galileo Galilei) , 2002 Verlag Harri Deutsch, Frankfurt am Main, In the earlier literature it is incorrectly claimed that M√§stlin, when travelling through Italy, converted Galilei to Copernicanism. We know today that Galilei was first introduced to Copernicus' work through Christian Wursteisen. Adsabs.harvard.edu The first known calculation J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, The Golden ratio, 2001, The first known calculation of the golden ratio as a decimal was given in a letter written in 1597 by Michael Maestlin, at the University of T√ºbingen, to his former student Kepler. He gives \\"about 0.6180340\\" for the length of the longer segment of a line of length 1 divided in the golden ratio. The correct value is 0.61803398874989484821... The mystical feeling for the golden ratio was of course attractive to Kepler, as was its relation to the regular solids. History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk of the (inverse) golden ratio as a decimal of \\"about 0.6180340\\" was written in 1597 by Maestlin in a letter to Kepler. Michael Maestlin was one of the very few astronomers of the sixteenth century that fully adopted the Copernican hypothesis, that proposed that the Earth was a planet and that it moved around the sun. Maestlin reacted to the thought of distant stars spinning around a fixed earth every 24 hours and taught everything that he could about Copernicus to Kepler. In November 1572 Maeslin and many others around the world witnessed a strange light in the sky that we now know was a galactic supernova. Maeslin attempted to explain this phenomenon in his tract entitled Demonstratio astronomica loci stellae novae, tum respectu centri mundi, tum respectu signiferi & aequinoctialis. This tract of Maeslin‚Äôs was a short mathematical and astronomical appendix detailing the nova and was published in T√ºbingen in March or April of 1573.This nova was called the Nova of Cassiopeia and was the first galactic supernova to be observed in Europe. Maeslin‚Äôs treatise attracted the attention of Tycho Brahe, who reproduced it in its entirety, along with his criticism, in one of the best known publications on the nova, in his posthumously printed Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata. Maestlin's treatise is available in manuscript format in Stuttgart and in Marburg. The programme of Maestlin‚Äôs treatise of 1573 over the supernova was practically identical to that of Tycho Brahe's longer treatise De stella nova, which published in the same year two or three months later. Tycho‚Äôs Progymnasmata, was also nearly identical to Maeslin‚Äôs treaties, which was Ô¨Ånished latter in 1592 but published only in 1602, a year after Tycho Brahe's death. Tycho Brahe's depiction of the comet of 1577 traveling across the sky. Maestlin in following the copernicium solar system believed that the ‚Äòmovement of commutation‚Äô (or ‚Äòparallactic motion‚Äô) of the superior planets, those being planets with a farther distance from the sun compared to the earth, and the lack of parallactic motion in the nova meant that the nova had to occur outside the planetary rings and in the ring of fixed stars. This nova occurring in the ring of fixed stars contradicted the previous understandings of Ptolemaic and Aristotelian. Maestlin also concluded that the nova helped to prove the heliocentric solar system as he said unless people concede that comets can be placed in the stellar orb, whose altitude is immense and whose extension we do not know, to which also the distance between the Sun and the Earth is incomparable, as witnessed by Copernicus. In 1580, Maestlin observed another comet and began to gather up some ideas on how it formed. Nine years later in 1589, Maestlin shared his conclusions about the appearance of the comet with his friend the astrologer, Helisaeus Roeslin, who said that the moon was located in front of the Great Comet of 1577, Also this same year, Maestlin published a dissertation on the fundamental principles of astronomy and the first edition of his book Epitome Astronomiae (Epitome of Astronomy). Epitome Astonomiae consisted of six editions and used works like Ptolemy‚Äôs famous geocentric model to create his descriptions of astronomy. The preface in the 1596 republication of Rheticus' Narratio Prima was also written by Maestlin. This preface was an introduction to the work of Copernicus. Additionally, Maestlin made many contributions to tables and diagrams in Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum. Kepler's publication of Mysterium Cosmographicum was supervised by Maestlin, in which he added his own appendix to the publication over Copernican planetary theory with help from Erasmus Reinhold's Prutenic Tables. A discussion of the great sphere and the lunar sphere, as well as more discussion and conclusions to his descriptions of the Copernican planetary theory was also added by Maestlin in Kepler's book. Maestlin and Kepler communicated through a series of letters about Kepler‚Äôs book the Mysterium Cosmographim in which Maestlin added his appendix ‚ÄúOn the Dimensions of the Heavenly Circles and Spheres, according to the Prutenic tables after the theory of Nicolaus Copernicus‚Äù This appendix contained a set of planetary distances in addition to a method of deriving them from the Prutenic tables. Maestlin also added his own understanding of Nicolaus Copernicus‚Äô geometry to Kepler's book. When. Maestlin and Kepler were communicating through letters regarding Kepler's book the discussed such topics such as the inaccuracy of the values that Copernicus used when calculating the spheres of the cosmos.Grafton, A. (1973). Michael Maestlin's Account of Copernican Planetary Theory. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 117(6), 523-550. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/986463 With the help of Maeslin in 1595, Kepler believed that he had discovered the relationship between the planets period and the distance from the sun. He did so by first assuming equal velocity of each planet and then observing that the planets did not just revolve just according to the length of their radii. Kepler observed that the sun exerted a force that was progressively attenuated as planets are farther and farther away from the sun itself. Maeslin even provided the geometry to help visualize Kepler‚Äôs theory of the sun force and its effects of the other planets. While frequent in communication with Kepler through the form of letters during the years 1594 to 1600, Maestlin appeared to quit the dialogue with his former student. Kepler, eager to keep the conversation alive, wrote more letters to which he would receive no response. This lasted between the years of 1600 to 1605. It is said that Maestlin‚Äôs period of silence ensued due to his fear that Kepler would publish their letters of correspondence. There have been other reasons speculated as to why Maestlin cut off communication with his disciple Kepler including a personal crisis in reaction to rumors of his own suicide. Kepler, frustrated with his teacher‚Äôs refusal to continue their written communication, complained in a letter dated December 14, 1604, to respond about his thoughts on the nova recently discovered and highly discussed. To not write about this event would to Kepler make Maestlin guilty of ‚Äúcrime of deserting astronomy‚Äù. Maestlin finally began talking again the month after this letter, around the end of January 1605. In this letter he accomplished several things. He first explained and gave reason to his silence as being because there was nothing more of use to add to the prior explanations concerning the questions Kepler had addressed to him. In regard to the nova, he deduced that it was in fact just a star that had previously not been discovered or noticed. = Astronomy = While Maestlin had many interests like calendar reform and mathematics, he was above all, an astronomer. He spent much time researching the sun, moon, and eclipses. His 1596 work, Disputatio de Eclipsibus is almost entirely about the sun and the moon and is often referred to in Kepler's 1604 work, Astronomiae pars optica . In 1587, Maestlin published a manuscript entitled Tabula Motus Horarii in which he gives the daily motion of the sun in hours and minutes with its positions in two-minute intervals. There are a few other tables he published that gives equivalent information but in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Maestlin is also responsible for adding an appendix to Kepler's Mysterium and, based on correspondence with Kepler, which he had frequently, he is known to have been more involved in the editing process of its creation. Maestlin and his former student, Kepler, have been known to have had frequent correspondence via letters, however, there was a time when Maestlin stopped responding to Keplers messages. When he finally started responding to Kepler's letters again, he explained his silence in that he wouldn't have been able to add anything of meaning to Kepler's requests for help with his work, however, this Maestlin would prove his own statement wrong by being greatly involved in Kepler's work in the future.Granada, M. A. (2014). Michael Maestlin and His Unpublished Treatise on the Nova of 1604. Journal for the History of Astronomy, 45(1), 91‚Äì122. doi: 10.1177/002182861404500106 Maestlin was involved in Kepler's Mysterium in that he added diagrams of his views on the order of the planets and the spacing between them to clarify his point. This was the first time such a thing had been done.Grasshoff, G. (2012). Michael Maestlins mystery: Theory building with diagrams. Cambridge, Eng. These very diagrams are what caused a misunderstanding that lasted over centuries. Maestlin did not make it clear whether the planets were supposed to be moving on the lines of the circles that were supposed to represent his planetary system, or whether they were meant to be moving within the spaces drawn by Maestlin. This led to many people believing that the planetary system suggested by Copernicus included a smaller number of modifications (such as epicycles) than that of Ptolemy, when the very opposite was the case. Despite the confusion these diagrams caused, Maestlin contributed greatly to Kepler's Mysterium, which even lead Kepler so far as to acknowledge Maestlin's co- authoring the book in a letter Maestlin.Grasshoff, G. (2012). Michael Maestlins Mystery: Theory Building with Diagrams. Journal for the History of Astronomy, 43(1), 57‚Äì73. doi: 10.1177/002182861204300104 Maestlin‚Äôs added appendix also contained more than just the set of planetary distances and their methods of derivation from the tables of corrections. On top of this, he included an assessment of the Copernican models, including his understanding of the geometry behind these models for the earth, moon, and other planets. In what would be the final form of the appendix Maestlin also discusses his student, Kepler, and the quality of his findings and knowledge on the subject of astronomy. Maestlin‚Äôs treatise on the nova of 1572 featured many aspects extremely similar to Tycho de Brahe‚Äôs much longer treatise on the same nova titled De Stella Nova. Both were published the same year, 1602, even though Maestlin‚Äôs was thought to be written much earlier. In this treatise, Maestlin focused extensively on the mathematics behind the new star‚Äôs exact location. In accordance to the Copernican view of the heavens, Johannes Kepler calculated there to be empty spaces between the planetary orbs of the heavens, and Maestlin suggested that these empty spaces might be where comets frequently occur.Barker, Peter (Summer 2002). \\"Constructing Copernicus\\". Perspectives on Science. 10: 208‚Äì227 ‚Äì via Project MUSE. This sort of revelation was only possible under the assumption of a heliocentric universal organization. Maestlin is believed to have come to this heliocentric view after observing the path of a comet in 1577. When that comet appeared, Maestlin, alongside with the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe were the first people who actively tried to calculate its path in a more complex way than simply track its path in the sky.Barker, P. (2002). Constructing Copernicus. Perspectives on Science, 10(2), 208‚Äì227. doi: 10.1162/106361402321147531 Tycho Brahe and Maestlin in tracking the comet deduced that the comet was not only travelling across the sky but it was going through Aristotle's and Ptolemy's solid geocentric orbs suggesting that the spheres of planets were not solid as previous astronomers believed. In 1604, Maestlin was one of the first astronomers able to observe the 1604 Supernova (later dubbed Kepler's Supernova) on 9 October 1604. He made his observations visually without instruments and took intense personal note of his observations, however, did not immediately publish them. Instead, be began working on a treatise, entitled Consideratio Astronomica inusitatae Novae et prodigiosae Stellae, superiori 1604 anno, sub initium Octobris, iuxta Eclipticam in signo Sagittarii vesperi exortae, et adhuc nunc eodem loco lumine corusco lucentis (Astronomical consideration of the extraordinary and prodigious new star that appeared near the ecliptic in the sign of Sagittarius one evening in early October in the preceding year 1604, and continues to shine in the same place with a tremulous light) with the intent to publish it in the coming years. He began seriously working on the treatise in 1606, however, it was never fully completed.Granada, M. A. (2014). Michael Maestlin and His Unpublished Treatise on the Nova of 1604. Journal for the History of Astronomy, 45(1), 91‚Äì122. https://doi.org/10.1177/002182861404500106 In 1613, Maestlin obtained his first set of telescopes. In a letter to Kepler, Maestlin says he was unable to view the satellites of Saturn or the phases of Venus, however, he was able to see the moons of Jupiter. A conference was held in Tubingen (where Maestlin was a professor at the university) in 2000 on Maestlin and his life and works. From these, Gerhard Betsch Gerhard Betsch produced a collective volume on their findings and breakdown of his works as well as a summary of Maestlin‚Äôs nachlass, a german word meaning collection of manuscripts, notes, letters, correspondence, etc. left behind when a scholar passes. His nachlass had been kept and preserved among different library archives in both Germany and Austria. Betsch discussed many things in his dissertation including a treatise composed by Maestlin on the Comet of 1618-1619 written completely in German. An important work Betsch failed to mention was Maestlin‚Äôs treatise on the Comet of 1604. This work, written completely in Latin this time, was titled Consideratio Astronomica inusitatae Novae et prodigiosae Stellae, superiori 1604 anno, sub initium Octobris, iuxta Eclipticam in signo Sagittarii vesperi exortae, et adhuc nunc eodem loco lumine corusco lucentis. Or in english, Astronomical consideration of the extraordinary and prodigious new star that appeared near the ecliptic in the sign of Sagittarius one evening in early October in the preceding year 1604, and continues to shine in the same place with a tremulous light. The work consisted of a view of his thoughts on the comet and extends just over 12 pages but is problematic to read. There are many cancellations and additions as well as notes and marks on words. The work is also unfinished which leads scholars to believe either Maestlin failed to finish or the final pages have been lost sometime in the past centuries. The best estimated date for his treatise has been noted as April 1605. Maestlin describes the months of February or March when the comet showed signs of decreasing intensity and brightness. He estimated its expiration or disappearance for May of the same year. His reasoning for this estimation came from the fact that the sun would be in opposition with the nova at this point in time. He discusses extensively the intensity and magnitude of the nova and how it differs from the patterns seen in previous novas such as that of 1572. This comet of 1572 was first seen at a certain magnitude and like others before and after it, experienced a constant decreasing throughout its visibility. This comet of 1604 however, maintained a large magnitude for sometime as a first-magnitude star like that of Venus and the other brightest stars. Christianity During the days of Maestlin and Kepler, it could be considered dangerous business to be questioning God's responsibility for creating the world and all the creatures in it, because one might be accused of blasphemy. Maestlin saw things in a different light, however. He was a follower of the Lutheran church, and as such, he believed that studying the natural world and unraveling the laws that embody it will bring humanity closer to God. In Maestlin's opinion, understanding God's creations will enable his children to be closer to him and his divine plan. He further believed that finding out more about the natural world we live in will enrich the knowledge we have of God.Barker, P., & Goldstein, B. R. (2001).

He was notable in that he was one of only a handful of young African American musicians from Mississippi who had learned and was continuing the Delta blues and country blues traditions of the older generations. In addition to the acoustic and electric guitar, Pitchford was also skilled at the one-string guitar and diddley bow, a one-string instrument of African origin, as well as the double bass, piano and harmonica. He was a prot√©g√© of Robert Lockwood Jr., from whom he learned the style of Robert Johnson. For a while, Pitchford performed accompanied by Johnny Shines and Lockwood. His own debut album, All Round Man was released on Rooster Blues Records in 1994. Pitchford performed at the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife, and at the 1984 Downhome Blues Festival in Atlanta, Georgia. In November 1998, Pitchford died at his home in Lexington, from AIDS. A diddley bow is featured on his headstone which was paid for by John Fogerty and Rooster Blues Records through the Mt.

The region is characterised by a largely flat, rocky terrain and is centred on the town of Aranda de Duero, although the most famous vineyards surround Pe√±afiel and Roa de Duero to the west, where the regional regulatory council or Consejo Regulador for the denominaci√≥n is based. Ribera del Duero was named Wine Region of the Year 2012 by the prestigious Wine Enthusiast Magazine.  History  Wine has been produced in the region for thousands of years, but viticulture as we know it probably arrived in the Ribera del Duero region with Benedictine monks from Cluny in the Burgundy region of France in the twelfth century. Ribera del Duero wine making goes back over 2,000 years as evidenced by the 66-meter mosaic of Bacchus, the god of wine that was unearthed relatively recently at Ba√±os de Valdearados. Official seal of the Ribera del Duero denominaci√≥n de origen (DO) The denominaci√≥n de origen (D.O.) of Ribera del Duero was founded on July 21, 1982, by an organization of wine producers and growers who were determined to promote the quality of their wines and enforce regulatory standards.DrinkRiberaWine.com: History , accessed on October 7, 2009 Reports that it was set to be upgraded to denominaci√≥n de origen calificada (DOCa) status in 2008 proved to be unfounded and, as at 2011, it remains a DO and has no plans to change.Decanter.com March 29, 2007: Ribera del Duero awaits appellation upgrade Ribero del Duero wines are currently enjoying greater popularity, thanks largely to the considerable interest shown in the area by experienced growers from other regions.  Geography  A 2007 Ribera del Duero from Pesquera. The Ribera del Duero is located on the extensive, elevated northern plateau of the Iberian Peninsula. It occupies the southern plains of the province of Burgos, extends west into Valladolid and includes parts of Segovia and Soria provinces to the south and east, respectively. As its name suggests, the region follows the course of the Duero river for approximately 115 km upstream from Valladolid and is around 35 km at its widest. The region is located around the younger stretches of the river, which later passes through the nearby Toro and Rueda regions before traversing the famous Portuguese growing areas of Douro and Porto, where it drains into the Atlantic Ocean. Geologically, tertiary sediments, consisting of gently lenticular layers of silty or clayey sand, alternate with layers of limestone, marl and chalky concretions. The Duero valley, formed during the Miocene period, has a flat, rocky, gently undulating terrain, ranging from 911 m down to 750 m above sea level. The national highway N122 follows the river valley. The Ribera del Duero has moderate to low rainfall (450 mm per year) and is exposed to quite extreme climatic conditions; long, dry summers with temperatures of up to 40 ¬∞C are followed by hard winters during which temperatures often come close to freezing temperatures. There are also marked variations in temperature within each season. The climate is continental and Mediterranean, with more than 2,400 hours of annual sunlight. Vineyards occupy around 120 km¬≤ of the region, most of which are situated in the province of Burgos, with around 5 km¬≤ in Valladolid and 6 km¬≤ in Soria. Grapes Wines produced in the Ribera del Duero DO derive almost exclusively from red grapes. The vast majority of production is dedicated to Tinto Fino (the local name for Tempranillo), the dominant red varietal in the northern half of the Spanish peninsula. Tinto Fino is often, but not always, complemented with Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot, although the famous Tinto Pesquera, grown by Alejandro Fern√°ndez in Pesquera de Duero, is a 100% Tempranillo varietal wine. The introduction of Pesquera's 100% Tinto Fino wine was, at the time, somewhat controversial, as the considered benchmark Vega Sicilia wines traditionally blended Tinto Fino with such Bordeaux varietals as Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. The DOP's authorized red grapes are: Tinto Fino, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, and Garnacha Tinta. The Albillo grape is the only authorized white variety grown, for white wines that mostly destined for local consumption.  Main Wineries  Wine barrels in Bodegas Casaj√∫s, in Quintana del Pidio. There are more than 300 wineries that belong to the D.O., some of them are: * Burgos: Bodegas Casaj√∫s, P√°ramo de Corcos, Pago de los Capellanes, Dominio Basconcillos, Adrada Ecol√≥gica, Casado Alvides, Vi√±a Sastre, Frutos Arag√≥n, Ortega Fournier, Balb√°s, Linaje Garsea, Garc√≠a Figuero, Izquierdo, F√©lix Callejo, Cillar de Silos, Ismael Arroyo, Real Sitio Ventosilla, Mart√≠n Berdugo, Pe√±alba, Neo, Valduero, Imperiales, Pascual, Se√±or√≠o de Nava, P√©rez Pascuas, Virgen de la Asunci√≥n, Monte Aixa, Montegaredo, Pomar Vi√±edos, Torres de Anguix, √Åster, L√≥pez Crist√≥bal, Condado de Haza, Vi√±a Solorca, P√°ramo de Guzm√°n, Andr√©s Matey, Gallego Zapatero, Viyuela, Valle de Monz√≥n, Los Matucos, Prado de Olmedo, Muntra, Portia, San Mam√©s, Valderiz, S.A.T.

Production  Wine bottles from three well-known bodegas in Ribera del Duero: Alion, Vega Sicilia (here its second wine, Valbuena 5¬∞) and Pesquera There are other similarities between Rioja and Ribera del Duero. Whereas the wines are quite distinctive as a result of significant differences in terroir, both regions produce wines selected for long aging with highly complex vinification procedures, producing intense, extremely long-lived wines emanating from largely limestone soils. Wines are classified as much for their longevity as their grape quality, and Ribera del Duero produces some extremely well-aging wines. The aging requirements for Ribera del Duero are the same used in Rioja. Wines labelled as \\"Crianza\\" must age two years with 12 months in oak. \\"Reserva\\" wines must be aged at least three years with at least 12 months in oak. The \\"Gran Reserva\\" labelled wines must spend 5 years aging prior to release, two being in oak. The town of Pesquera is particularly noted for its wines and the area around La Horra (another small town in the region) is respected by locals for its consistent quality. Vi√±a Sastre is one of the region's more respected wine producers and the world-renowned Vega Sicilia easily the most famous. Vega Sicilia's more eminent customers include Prince Charles of the British royal family, while Alex Ferguson's favourite wine is Pesquera. Other notable bodegas include, Dominio de Pingus, Bodegas Arzuaga Navarro, Bodegas Alion, and Hacienda Monasterio, all of which lie along The Golden Mile, Spain.

It is a direct dye for cotton textiles.. In biosciences, it is used as a vital stain to selectively colour dead tissues or cells blue. Live cells or tissues with intact cell membranes are not coloured. Since cells are very selective in the compounds that pass through the membrane, in a viable cell trypan blue is not absorbed; however, it traverses the membrane in a dead cell. Hence, dead cells appear as a distinctive blue colour under a microscope. Since live cells are excluded from staining, this staining method is also described as a dye exclusion method. Background and chemistry Trypan blue is derived from toluidine, that is, any of several isomeric bases, C14H16N2, derived from toluene. Trypan blue is so-called because it can kill trypanosomes, the parasites that cause sleeping sickness. An analog of trypan blue, suramin, is used pharmacologically against trypanosomiasis. Trypan blue is also known as diamine blue and Niagara blue. The extinction coefficient for trypan blue is 6‚ãÖ104 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 607 nm in methanol. Trypan red and trypan blue were first synthesized by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich in 1904. Uses of trypan blue Observation with an optical microscope of Hyaloperonospora parasitica within a leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana by using the trypan blue staining. Trypan blue is commonly used in microscopy (for cell counting) and in laboratory mice for assessment of tissue viability. The method cannot distinguish between necrotic and apoptotic cells. It may be used to observe fungal hyphae and stramenopiles. Trypan blue is also used in ophthalmic cataract surgery to stain the anterior capsule in the presence of a mature cataract, to aid in visualization, before creating the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis. In keratoplasty, trypan blue can be used to stain the posterior stromal fibers during deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) and to stain the endothelium in Descemet‚Äôs stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK). Trypan blue is used in vitreoretinal surgeries also. In early 20th century, the existence of a barrier protective toward the brain (blood brain barrier) was inferred, based on the observation that injection of trypan blue in animals led to whole‚Äêbody staining except for the brain and spinal cord.

It was originally serialized in Analog science-fiction magazine, January‚ÄìApril 1986. Plot introduction The novel proposes invasions from alternate Earths in alternate universes. None of these universes are quite like our universe; however, they all have some element or other in common, many of which Pohl develops to satiric effect. * In one universe, Nancy Reagan is the President of the United States and her mostly disregarded husband Ronald is known as \\"The First Gentleman\\". John F. Kennedy is a Senator from Massachusetts who is married to a woman called Marilyn. * In another universe, America's political spectrum has shifted far to the right; Ronald Reagan remained true to his early left-wing politics and is still married to his first wife Jane Wyman. * In the past of some of the worlds, the young revolutionary Joseph Dzhugashvili (not known in these worlds as Joseph Stalin) had escaped from Russia to America in the 1900s, taking with him the proceeds of a robbery (the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery) conducted on behalf of the Bolsheviks and using the money to set himself up as a big American capitalist. The book presents multiple versions of three characters‚ÄîDominic DeSota, Nyla Christophe, and Larry Douglas‚Äîand their interactions as different versions of the characters travel from one Earth to another. Dominic DeSota is the main character, with most of the book told from the divergent viewpoints of three of his avatars (see following), with brief glimpses of numerous additional Dominic DeSotas scattered throughout the novel as varying between a nuclear scientist and a hunter scrabbling for bare existence in the ruins left after a nuclear holocaust. The book seems to argue in favor of the idea that social conditions rather than heredity shape a person's character and behavior (the nature versus nurture debate). As depicted again and again in the course of the book, people born with precisely the same genetic heritage can - given different social conditions - develop completely different character traits (timid or assertive, benevolent or predatory, etc.) =Origin of the title= The title refers to the famous thought-experiment known as \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat\\", where the outcome of a real-world event depends on a quantum event. By some interpretations, the real-world object, in this case a cat, must be in two states simultaneously until it is observed. However, the story is more closely related to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics where all possible outcomes of an event occur, each in its own parallel universe. The same concept was treated, somewhat more pessimistically, in Larry Niven's short story \\"All the Myriad Ways\\". Plot summary The novel begins with Nicky DeSota as a timid mortgage broker in a fascist America, who draws the unwelcome attention of Nyla Christophe, an agent of the FBI (a brutal, full- fledged secret police in his world), who is investigating a break-in at a government lab by someone who proves to be a Dominic DeSota from an alternate universe. Used as a pawn by Christophe's con-man boyfriend Larry Douglas to entrap an left-wing activist and former actor (who turns out to be Ronald Reagan), he is later detained and brought to New Mexico to unravel a mystery. The focus then shifts to another Dominic DeSota, a United States Senator having an affair with Nyla Christophe Bowquist, who in this world is a famous violinist. Contacted by the military, he travels to Sandia National Laboratories, where he meets an identical version of himself‚Äîa \\"Cat\\" from an alternate universe. As Senator DeSota interviews his alternate-universe counterpart, the man vanishes after offering a cryptic warning. As the senator leaves the building, the base commander and he are captured by a detachment of troops led by Major Dominic P. DeSota, the commander of a military force from yet another universe. Major DeSota's mission is revealed to be to secure the parallel-world research facilities of Senator DeSota's universe, which is the first step in a larger military operation. In Major DeSota's universe (which is subsequently designated Paratime Gamma), a militaristic United States is engaged in a tense standoff with the Soviet Union, and wants to use Senator DeSota's universe (Paratime Epsilon) to launch sneak attacks against them. After being transported to Paratime Gamma, Senator DeSota manages to escape by distracting his guard, Sgt. Nyla Sambok (Gamma's version of Nyla Christophe) and escaping through a portal with a scientist to Paratime Tau‚Äîthe home universe of Nicky DeSota. After being discovered in the desert, Senator DeSota and the scientist‚Äîwho is Larry Douglas from another universe‚Äîare captured and interrogated by Agent Christophe. In an interrogation session involving the senator, the scientist, and their counterparts from Paratime Tau, Douglas reveals that he is from Paratime Alpha, and that he was forced by the military in Paratime Gamma to give them the ability to travel between universes. As Agent Christophe begins to pressure Douglas to give her government similar assistance, the other FBI agent with her and she are rendered unconscious by knockout darts fired by Dominic DeSota‚Äîthe same one who had escaped interrogation in Sandia. DeSota brings the entire group back to his universe‚ÄîParatime Alpha‚Äîwhere he explains that since the senator's escape that Paratime Gamma has invaded the Epsilon's Washington DC in a failed bid to capture the president. He also reveals that travel between universes is creating a growing problem of \\"ballistic recoil\\", where the boundaries between the universes is growing weaker, causing matter and energy to cross unintentionally from one universe to the next (something depicted in interludes between the chapters). He brings the travelers to Washington DC, where they cross over to Paratime Epsilon in an effort to help stop the invasion. Before they can help, however, every \\"Cat\\" located in a different universe disappears, along with any scientists involved in paratime research. There, they are informed that they have been transported by a group of more advanced alternate Earths to stop ballistic recoil before it escalates and the barriers between universes become irreparably permeable. The \\"Cats\\" are relocated to New York City on a new Earth, one being resettled after its inhabitants wiped themselves out. There, the paratime transplants gradually settle into new lives. Six months after his arrival, Nicky DeSota returns to New York to propose to Agent Christophe. Now working on a collective farm in Palm Springs, he has embraced the opportunity for a new life and developed into a much more confident man. After considering his proposal, the Nyla of his world accepts. On their trip back to California, however, Nicky reveals to her his expectation that their transplantation has not solved the problem of paratime travel‚Äîthat with an infinite number of Earths, the number of them that will develop the ability to cross into alternate worlds will only increase, so many that the problem of ballistic recoil may prove to be unavoidable.

However, the origin of both depressions is unrelated to glacier erosion. * The Seto Inland Sea in Japan is not a true inland sea but rather a body of water separating Honsh≈´, Shikoku, and Ky≈´sh≈´, three of the four main islands of Japan. Former epicontinental seas in Earth's history At various times in the geologic past, inland seas have been greater in extent and more common than at present. *During the Oligocene and Early Miocene large swathes of Patagonia were subject to a marine transgression. The transgression might have temporarily linked the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as inferred from the findings of marine invertebrate fossils of both Atlantic and Pacific affinity in La Cascada Formation. Connection would have occurred through narrow epicontinental seaways that formed channels in a dissected topography. *A vast inland sea, the Western Interior Seaway, extended from the Gulf of Mexico deep into present-day Canada during the Cretaceous. *At the same time, much of the low plains of modern-day northern France and northern Germany were inundated by an inland sea, where the chalk was deposited that gave the Cretaceous Period its name. *The Amazon, originally emptying into the Pacific, as South America rifted from Africa, found its exit blocked by the rise of the Andes about 15 million years ago. A great inland sea developed, at times draining north through what is now Venezuela before finding its present eastward outlet into the South Atlantic. Gradually this inland sea became a vast freshwater lake and wetlands where sediment flattened its profiles and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. Over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the freshwaters of the Amazon, which is also home to a freshwater dolphin. In 2005, fossilized remains of a giant crocodilian, estimated to have been in length, were discovered in the northern rainforest of Amazonian Peru. *In Australia, the Eromanga Sea existed during the Cretaceous Period. It covered large swaths of the eastern half of the continent.

Description  The original building started as the First Mortuary station in Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney, as noted on a plaque on the church: :\\"The stonework of this church was originally used to build the first mortuary station on the branch railway to the necropolis rookwood near Sydney. This plaque was presented by the Australian Railway Historical Society to commemorate the old station which was in use from 1868 to 1948.\\" The railway line went underneath the main arch in the building, where the aisle is in the present church. The side aisles are where the platforms for the station were located. Coffins would be taken out on the railway line to the cemetery for burial. The roof of the building burned down in a fire. The Ainslie parish bought the stonework for ¬£A100, and the stonework was transported to Canberra in 1957 where the current roof was built and work undertaken to turn it into the present church. In the process, the bell tower was moved from the left side of the entrance to the right. There are two stained-glass windows from England. The east window is from St Clement's, Attercliffe, in Sheffield. There is a second, smaller, window from St Margaret's Bagendon in Gloucestershire.https://www.allsaintsainslie.org.au/index.php/history/ The church bell was originally on a Shay locomotive owned by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation that ran on the former Wolgan Valley Railway in the Blue Mountains, before being dismantled in 1925. The bell was presented to the church by the Australian Railway Historical Society in 1958. A stone on the church was set by the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom, Lord Carrington, to mark the blessing of the church on 1 June 1958. The church contains a rare 1857 Bishop and Starr pipe organ, installed in 1989‚Äì90 after being transferred from Wealdstone Baptist Church in Harrow, England. All Saints maintains a traditional choir, with a weekly sung Solemn Eucharist and a monthly Evensong from April to September. At the east end of the church is a garden and columbarium. The church has several stained glass windows, and gargoyle sculptures on the outside of the building. On the inside stonework are two carved angels. It has two side chapels located on opposite sides of the chancel, one dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the other after Gethsemane.

The term \\"Kwomtari languages\\" can also refer to one of the established families that makes up this proposal. Classification history =Loving and Bass (1964)= A \\"Kwomtari\\" (= Kwomtari‚ÄìFas) phylum was first proposed by Loving and Bass (1964). The following classification is based on their proposal, with the addition of the Pyu and language, added by Laycock (1975): Kwomtari‚ÄìFas phylum *Kwomtari‚ÄìNas family: Kwomtari, Nai (Biaka) *Fas family: Fas, Baibai =Laycock (1975)= Laycock (1973; 1975) grouped the languages differently, placing Kwomtari and Fas together in the \\"Kwomtari family\\", and Baibai and Nai (Biaka) together in a \\"Baibai family\\", and calling the overall grouping \\"Kwomtari‚ÄìBaibai\\". Laycock also added the Pyu isolate, though he admitted, \\"A great deal more work is required on the Kwomtari Phylum before the classification can be regarded as established\\" (1973:43), and he published no evidence. Kwomtari‚ÄìBaibai phylum (spurious) *Kwomtari‚ÄìFas family: Kwomtari, Fas *Baibai‚ÄìBiaka family: Baibai, Nai (Biaka) *Pyu isolate =Baron (1983)= However, Baron (1983) notes that Laycock's reclassification appears to have been due to an alignment error in the published comparative data of Loving & Bass. Their raw field notes support their original classification: They found a Swadesh list of Kwomtari to have 45% cognates with Biaka (Nai), while they note that Baibai has only 3% cognates with Biaka, and so cannot be assigned to the same family. Compare (Baron 1983:5 converted to IPA): { class=\\"IPA wikitable\\" - !Gloss!!Fas!!Baibai!!Kwomtari!!Biaka!!Guriaso - !man jim…õ(niÃ•)jim…õnilofwaidoŒ≤waiam…ô…æim - !woman momo≈ãoinaliinaliajti - !nose s…ô ôtes…ôm…înitiput…îpok…æiap…ôdu - !eye k…îjko…æ…ô(w)uwomukatu } Baron coined the name \\"Kwomtari‚ÄìFas\\" to explicitly correct \\"Kwomtari‚ÄìBaibai\\", the name under which Laycock's arrangement was commonly known. Baron added a newly discovered language, Guriaso, as a divergent branch of the Kwomtari family proper, and noted that as of that date Laycock maintained the inclusion of Pyu. However, Baron believes there is little to suggest that the Kwomtari family, Fas family, and Pyu are actually related, except that Kwomtari and Fas use similar kinship terms, which are shared by neighboring families that are not thought to be related to either Kwomtari or Fas. =Ross (2005)= Malcolm Ross linked Laycock's Kwomtari‚ÄìBaibai family to the small Left May (Arai) family in a Left May ‚Äì Kwomtari proposal, which is based on common pronouns. However, the link appears less straightforward once the correction is made for Loving and Bass' data. See Left May ‚Äì Kwomtari for details. =Foley (2018)= Foley (2018) provides the following classification. *Momu (Fas), Baibai *Guriaso *Kwomtari, Nai-Biaka *Pyu Foley (2018) considers the possibility that each of the four groups may in fact constitute a separate language family of its own. He remains open to the idea that they may be related to each other, though he leaves this question open at the time of publication. Possible Pyu‚ÄìKwomtari pronominal cognates listed by Foley (2018) are: :{ + Possible Pyu‚ÄìKwomtari pronoun cognates ! Pronoun !! Kwomtari !!

He was also renowned for his ability as a communicator, reaching the general public in a series of popular and acclaimed books on his subject. Education and early life He was born in 1944 in Mufulira, Zambia, and studied geology at Imperial College London. His doctoral thesis investigated the structural geology of Barra, Lewis and Harris in the Hebrides, Scotland. Career and research His PhD was followed by fieldwork in the central Andes of northern Chile, a region with which his name would become synonymous in later years. He became a volcanologist recruited to the Open University in 1971, he continued his fieldwork in the Andes, and complemented this with image analysis using Landsat images which were becoming available in the early-1970s. This work enabled him and co-workers to recognise many large volcanic features in the central Andes, including debris avalanche deposits from multiple volcanic edifices. One prominent example is the almost perfectly preserved deposit at Socompa Volcano, Chile. The imagery also revealed several larger structures on the Andean altiplano, which proved to be a series of large calderas. These included the large La Pacana and Cerro Gal√°n calderas. Fieldwork in 1982 at Cerro Gal√°n, in the remote northwest of Argentina, which involved the support of both UK and Argentine armed forces, was the last co- operation between the two countries before the Falkland Islands / Las Malvinas conflict later that year. He was visiting scholar at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, Texas, and subsequently as a Visiting Professor in the Planetary Geosciences Division of the University of Hawaii, Manoa, Hawaii, he were followed in 1991 by a return to the Open University, where he was Director of Teaching from 1996 and Professor of Volcanology from 1998. His drive to promote the science of volcanology led to the publication in 1976 of his highly successful Penguin book Volcanoes, which was followed in 1993 by Volcanoes: a Planetary perspective.Francis, P.

It was to be a western themed boat ride, slated to appear in the northwestern section of Frontierland at the Magic Kingdom, a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, United States. This Disney attraction is not to be confused with a similarly named river rafting outfitter with a plural spelling (Western River Expeditions, WRE). Both the Disney attraction and the rafting company were conceived at roughly the same time (early 1960s) and it is unknown if either knew of the other's existence until recent web searches began producing results for both. History =Walt Disney World= When Walt Disney World opened in 1971, it featured many popular Disneyland rides, but not Pirates of the Caribbean. The Western River Expedition was to have been Walt Disney World's answer to this ride. When plans were being made for the Magic Kingdom, Imagineers had no plans to replicate Pirates of the Caribbean for the Magic Kingdom. At the time, it was believed by many Imagineers that Florida residents were too accustomed to pirates, as pirates are part of Florida's local legends and lore. Disney management thought that cowboys and Indians would be more surprising and exciting to Florida residents. However, this led to many inquiries of \\"Where are the pirates?\\" and complaints being filed during the early days of the resort's operation. =The Ride= The attraction began life as a proposal of a historical recreation of the Western Expansion of the United States, that would have been built on the banks of the Mississippi River in St. Louis, near the Jefferson National Memorial. Animator-Imagineer Marc Davis designed the attraction and characters in the form of drawings and models over a five-years period. Disney executives such as Richard Irvine and Roy Disney both liked the idea when presented with Davis' concepts. The attraction was to have been located inside, outside and around an architectural feature in Frontierland known as Thunder Mesa Mountain. Guests would have entered an inside boarding zone, in a twilight atmosphere (similar to the night atmosphere in Pirates of the Caribbean). After boarding a wooden launch, riders would have glided up a waterfall. The ride's narrator, Hoot Gibson (an audio-animatronic owl) would explain the ride's safety instructions. Then, guests would have passed by peaceful scenes in the wilderness, featuring buffaloes or prairie dogs. They would then encounter banditos robbing a stagecoach, warning them they would meet again downriver. Many following scenes would then take place in a fictional town known as Dry Gulch, where guests would have witnessed a musical show (a bank robbery, prisoners escaping the Sheriff's cells via a tunnel, a saloon with a cowboy on horseback on its roof, plus ten other characters including a bartender trying to shoot the intruder off the roof, three saloon girls, and other cowboys hooting and hollering. Then, back into the wilderness, guests would have discovered Indian adobe houses, and even witnessed a rain dance that causes it to rain on the set. The ride would finally come to an end with guests about to be robbed by the aforementioned banditos, but escaping via a waterfall-drop finale. If built, it would have been one of the most complex and expensive Disney attractions of its time, housed in one of the largest show buildings (a large warehouse that stores the interior of the attraction) ever created by the Disney company. Its projected expense is one reason it was never built. The attraction would have also shared the show building with a \\"runaway\\" mine train themed roller coaster. Other features of the pavilion- style WRE would have included hiking trails atop the mesa, a Pueblo Indian village, and a pack mule attraction. =Pirate locations= When the Magic Kingdom opened, the most common complaint from guests were that there were no pirates. Disney hastily built a second Pirates of the Caribbean ride in the Magic Kingdom, thus scrapping plans for the Western River Expedition because much of the budget planned to build it was used in building Pirates of the Caribbean for the Magic Kingdom. The economic downturn of the early 1970s and changes in Disney management also contributed to keeping the project from going through, along with concerns over the stereotypes of Indians and the loss of popularity of Westerns. Years later, there was the possibility that the Western River Expedition would be built. Such chances were minimized due to several factors, which, besides changes in management and an economic downturn, included: * The opening of Pirates of the Caribbean in 1973. WRE was seen to be a western themed version of Pirates. * The opening of Space Mountain, Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, the Star Jets (now Astro Orbiter), and the WedWay PeopleMover (now Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover) in 1974 and 1975, as part of the Tomorrowland Phase II development. The construction of these four attractions meant that money and resources could not be allocated to construction of attractions in other lands. * Groundbreaking for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in 1979, which took place on the very tract of land reserved for WRE. When ground broke on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in January 1979, Marc Davis, desperate to save his Western River Expedition, offered a compromise: the roller coaster could be built as long as a scaled down WRE was built opposite the railroad tracks. There would be no trails on top of this scaled down version. The only thing WRE would have was the boat ride. The proposed compromise never was enacted, and construction of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad continued. Frontierland would not receive a water based attraction until 1992, when Splash Mountain, a log flume themed to the film Song of the South, opened. Attractions made from elements of the Western River Expedition =Tom Sawyer Island= The original plans for WRE included a raft which would take guests to WRE, according to artist renderings.https://waltdatedworld.com/id205.htm Guests also take the raft to gain access to Tom Sawyer Island in Florida. Big Thunder Mountain =Big Thunder Mountain Railroad= The Magic Kingdom's version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad opened on November 15, 1980, on the plot of land originally to be occupied by the Western River Expedition. The original concepts for the ride incorporated it into the WRE pavilion, and also featured a backwards segment. Splash Mountain =Splash Mountain= Although themed to Song of the South, Splash Mountain is derived from the planned boat ride in WRE. =Thunder Mesa at Disneyland Paris= When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, Frontierland's fictional town was named Thunder Mesa, as a tribute to the WRE. This version of Frontierland was strongly influenced by WRE compared to any previous version. =Phantom Manor= The Phantom Canyon scene of Phantom Manor at Disneyland Park (Paris) is derived from the planned scene showing the town of Dry Gulch in WRE. There are even some WRE elements in Phantom Canyon, like the bank robbery, the showgirl and the bartender. =Expedition Everest= Although one might consider it to have no relations with WRE, Expedition Everest at Disney's Animal Kingdom does take one element from WRE : the backwards segment of the ride. The planned roller coaster in WRE was to have a backwards segment as well. Legend among Imagineers Western River Expedition is something of a legend among Disney Imagineers, especially to those who admire the work of Disney legend Marc Davis. Every time Imagineers pitch the ride idea to Disney executives, it is vetoed. Imagineers have instead slipped parts of the ride into other attractions: Splash Mountain, World of Motion, Phantom Manor, and Living with the Land. Davis' concept drawings and model for the Western River Expedition have been filed away in the Imagineering Research Library.

Foley (2018) notes that typologically, the Left May languages are highly different from the other language families of the Sepik-Ramu basin, instead resembling the Trans-New Guinea somewhat more closely. For example, Left May and Trans-New Guinea languages typically all have ergative case markers, which most languages of the Sepik-Ramu basin do not have except for a few such as the isolate Taiap. Nevertheless, Left May and Trans-New Guinea speakers have historically been hostile towards each other (unlike their close trade relationships with Amto- Musan speakers), so there has been no recent contact scenarios to speak of.

In the years to follow the additions to the park would include tennis and bowling lawns, zoo, campground, amusement park and a dance hall all before 1925. As time passed on, London grew around the park; about 1920 a miniature train was added as an attraction, and as of 2015 it still existed, although relocated and replaced. In the 1960s, the riverboat Storybook Queen was launched in the Thames and gave visitors to Storybook Gardens a taste of the long-over age of riverboat travel. = Sinking of Victoria = On May 24, 1881, the steamboat Victoria capsized and sank close to Cove Bridge after the boiler broke free and crashed through the supports holding up the second deck, causing the decks to collapse on one another. Hundreds of people drowned or suffered burns, and 238 bodies were recovered from the site. Many believe more bodies are still trapped under the shipwreck. This disaster is widely known among those living in London, and when it happened, it severely cut back the popularity of steamer travel along the Thames and scaled back the popularity of the waterworks grounds. The shipwreck of Victoria was eventually removed, but there is still part of the wreck sitting under the mud on the bottom of the river, and it can be seen during low water levels. Afterwards the grounds could still be reached by carriage and eventually horse-drawn bus, but interest would not recover for years. Storybook Gardens The castle-like entryway to Storybook Gardens Storybook Gardens opened in 1958. This popular attraction included sea lions (now replaced by harbour seals) and various other animals tied in with themes from children's nursery rhymes and stories. On June 16, 1958, \\"Slippery the Seal\\" escaped from a pool into the nearby Thames River. Ten days later, amid intense publicity and \\"sightings\\" of various degrees of reliability, the sea lion turned up 400 km away near Sandusky, Ohio. After several days on display to record-breaking crowds, the Americans returned Slippery. The mayor of London proclaimed \\"Slippery Day\\" and thousands lined the streets to see Slippery's return. An \\"international incident\\" staged between Storybook and the Toledo Zoo was later revealed to have been a publicity stunt.The Beaver June‚ÄìJuly 2006 (p. 13) The park also includes a carousel, a miniature train (which are both placed just outside the park), climbing facilities and slides which have been upgraded throughout the years. In 2003 Storybook Gardens underwent a major refurbishment to its present state and it now open year-round with skating in the winter. No animals currently reside here now: a fire claimed the barn in which the animals were housed, and the animals were unhurt and sent to live elsewhere. On June 8, 2012, while the remaining four seals at Storybook gardens were being transported to the Saint Louis Zoo, two seals, Peanut and Atlantis, died. A third seal, Cri Cri, died on June 13 while being treated. Present day At present Springbank Park is the largest park in London, with trails accommodating biking or walking. As well there are climbers, swings, a wading pool, picnic areas and soccer fields. With paths leading to adjoining parks one can travel 10 km from Byron to downtown London without dealing with traffic.

It saw action in World War II with France and the United Kingdom, who named it the Maryland. Design and development In response to a United States Army Air Corps light bomber requirement issued in 1938, the Glenn L. Martin Company produced its Model 167, which was given the official designation XA-22. Martin's design was a twin-engine all-metal monoplane, capable of around 310 mph (500 km/h) with a crew of three. The XA-22 was not adopted for operational service in the U.S., as the contract was won by the Douglas DB-7, which became the A-20 Havoc, but Martin received foreign orders, and about 450 of these fast, twin-engined bombers were built. The prototype Model 167W was powered by twin-row Pratt & Whitney R-1830-37 Twin Wasp engines, which were replaced in French production aircraft by single-row nine- cylinder Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines, although the Twin Wasps were then restored for the British Maryland. All versions of the Model 167 were armed with six machine guns, four fixed guns in the wings (mainly for ground- attack), one dorsal gun and one ventral gun. In the prototype, these guns were all 0.30 in Browning machine guns. The dorsal gun was mounted in a fully retractable turret. The French aircraft used license-built Belgian Fabrique Nationale FN-Brownings, and used a lighter semi-retractable dorsal turret. The weight saved helped to increase the top speed to . Martin XA-22, 13 April 1939 The Model 167 was a fairly typical twin-engined bomber of the period. The most unusual feature of the Model 167 was the very narrow fuselage, although it was shared with a number of late prewar contemporaries. The crew of three was carried in two isolated compartments: the bombardier sat in the nose below the pilot and the gunner was in the mid-upper twin-machine gun turret in a separate rear compartment, isolated by a bulkhead. Glenn L. Martin doubled the size of the Baltimore factory, and built all 115 aircraft in six months, but they were then prevented from delivering them by a US government arms embargo. Despite this the French placed an order for an additional 100 aircraft. The embargo was lifted in October 1939, and the 115 aircraft from the first order were delivered by late November 1939. Deliveries then slowed, and only 25 of the second batch reached France before the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Operational history =French service= A captured French Martin 167F at Aleppo, Syria, in 1941. Facing a massive German arms buildup and desperate for modern aircraft, the French Air Force purchased U.S. aircraft of numerous types in the late 1930s. Martin received an order for more than 200 167 Fs which incorporated French equipment such as metric instruments. French officials expected deliveries to begin in January 1939 but the type, locally called the Glenn Martin 167 A-3 entered service only in early 1940. Because of the U.S. embargo on arms exports after the beginning of the war, many aircraft were impounded for two months before being shipped to Europe. When the Battle of France began, there were only four Groupes de bombardement (bomber squadrons) equipped. The Glenns were quickly sent to the front lines where they performed well with their adequate speed and excellent manoeuvrability for an aircraft in this class.\\"The Martin Maryland goes to war, 23 October 1941.\\" :Fr Maryland Aviation Museum. Retrieved: 2 July 2012/ In about 400 sorties, they suffered a 4 per cent loss rate, much better than the 16 per cent endured by LeO 451 crews against similar targets. Immediately before the June 1940 Armistice, units flying the Glenn Martin 167 were evacuated to French North Africa to avoid capture by the Germans. One of them landed in Spain and was interned, being tested by the Spanish Air Force. Some examples were transferred to the A√©ronautique Navale. During Vichy rule of the French empire, French Martins bombed British Commonwealth forces, most notably during the Syria-Lebanon campaign of 1941.Documented in the memoirs of Roald Dahl and John Masters (The Road Past Mandalay) (1961.) As French North Africa got back in the Allied camp in 1943, M.167s were replaced with more modern Allied types, including the Martin B-26 Marauder. Approximately 215 Martin 167s were delivered to France. =British service= Martin Maryland bombers fly past in formation, North Africa 1941 Just before the Franco-German Armistice, the remaining 75 aircraft on the French order were signed over to the United Kingdom; 32 Marylands had been completed to French specifications and were converted to British requirements in the UK. Engines were changed from the Cyclone 9 to the Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp and various weapons and instruments were replaced. The last 43 of the order were completed as required by Glenn Martin. All these aircraft became the Maryland Mk.I. A further 150 aircraft had been ordered directly by Britain with two-speed superchargers on their Twin Wasps as the Maryland Mk.II.Military History Encyclopedia on the Web: Weapons - Martin Maryland Many of the aircraft were shipped to Egypt and Malta in time for the 1941 fighting there. The RAF used the aircraft mainly for photo-reconnaissance operations in North and East Africa, being faster than the Bristol Blenheim. A Maryland bomber photographed the Italian fleet before and after the Battle of Taranto on 11 November 1940.Bishop 2004, pp. 90‚Äì91. The pilot, Adrian Warburton, scored his five confirmed kills with the Maryland's forward-firing guns. Three Maryland Mk.Is were transferred to the British Fleet Air ArmJoseph F. Baugher: US Attack Aircraft - Martin Maryland and were mainly used for target towing duties.Mondey 2006, p. 175.

Licensed to the suburb of Morningside, Maryland with studios in Southeast DC in the Navy Yard neighborhood, it serves the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by Entercom. History On November 12, 1953, former FCC employee Harry Hayman received a construction permit for a radio station in Morningside operating at 250 watts daytime-only on 1580 kilohertz. The call letters WPGC, representing Prince George's County were issued soon afterwards. In May 1954, WPGC began as a multi-formatted radio station. Maxwell Evans Richmond purchased the station from Harry Hayman for $10,000 on November 10, 1954. On April 14, 1955, WPGC was issued a permit to raise power to 10,000 watts. It also moved its offices from Morningside to a facility in Hyattsville, Maryland. It later moved to Southeast, Washington, D.C. in studios formerly used by WBUZ (95.5). In 1958, the station started simulcasting its programming on 95.5, by then renamed WRNC; the station is now WPGC-FM, which it became after WPGC bought 95.5 outright. On June 28, 1965, the WPGC stations were granted a modification of their licenses to move their studios to Bladensburg while continuing to identify their city of license as Morningside. By then, the station played Top-40 programming with a format similar to WABC and WMCA in New York City and CKLW in Detroit, and was the most popular such station in the Washington area, rivaled only by WEAM (1390; now WZHF). Responding to the black population growth of the Washington area, WPGC began to alternate playing so-called \\"white\\" rock records with Motown and soul music. After Max Richmond died in 1971, his estate received FCC approval on August 7, 1974 to sell the WPGC stations for $5.8 million to First Media Corporation. The transaction was finalized on October 17, 1974. On April 9, 1979, the FCC granted WPGC a permit to raise power from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts directional. After 15 years in the Parkway Building in Bladensburg, the station moved to new state-of-the- art studios overlooking the Capital Beltway in Greenbelt in 1980; the station subsequently relocated to studios in Lanham. WPGC was finally granted nighttime operation in 1986. That October, the station received night power, operating at 270 watts. First Media sold all of its properties for $177 million to Cook Inlet Partners, a group of Alaska Natives, in early 1987. The station switched to a business talk format on October 1, 1988. In 1989, its night power was upgraded to 500 watts directional; the next year, it reverted to 270 watts, though still directional. Infinity Broadcasting acquired the WPGC stations from Cook Inlet in June 1994 for $60 million. On January 13, 1995, the station returned to music programming as \\"Flava 1580\\", with an all hip-hop/go-go format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-01-13.pdf The format was unsuccessful, and ultimately evolved to gospel in November 1996 as \\"Heaven 1580\\". WPGC dropped the gospel format October 7, 2008 and began simulcasting WPGC-FM. The simulcast ended on November 10, 2008, when the station switched to a talk format. The station also dropped the WPGC call letters after 54 years, taking on the WHFS callsign that CBS had dropped from what is now WJZ-FM a week before. On December 1, 2011, WHFS changed call letters to WNEW. This came near-simultaneously with the change of 99.1 FM to WNEW-FM. On October 1, 2012, WNEW changed their format to a hybrid government news/business news/talk format, branded as \\"1580 Gov. Biz Radio\\". This format was dropped on January 28, 2013, when the station joined CBS Sports Radio as a full-time affiliate. The station subsequently changed their call sign on January 29 to WJFK, matching call signs with sister station WJFK-FM \\"106.7 The Fan.\\" CBS launched an online portal called \\"Connecting Vets\\" in June 2017, consisting of news and podcasts oriented toward military veterans. Podcast content was combined with live drive-time news coverage into an Internet stream that also began airing on WJFK on June 5, 2017. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Despite the move to a talk format, WJFK continued some local sports coverage as an overflow partner for WJFK-FM. The station was nominally an affiliate of the Washington Nationals Radio Network, although coverage was limited to spring training games since WJFK-FM became the team's flagship. WJFK also carried D.C. United, Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball, and Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball games, which often conflict with WJFK-FM's coverage of the Nationals, Washington Capitals, and Washington Wizards. On April 9, 2018, WJFK flipped to a Spanish-language sports talk format as \\"El Zol Deportes\\", assuming the branding of its sister station WLZL (107.9 FM) and shifting its HD simulcast to WLZL-HD2. The station became an affiliate of ESPN Deportes Radio along with a local show from 3-5pm hosted by Ray Parker.

Targeting amateur astronomers, it contains columns on sky viewing, reader-submitted astrophotographs, and articles on astronomy and astrophysics for general readers. History Astronomy is a magazine about the science and hobby of astronomy. Based near Milwaukee in Waukesha, Wisconsin, it is produced by Kalmbach Publishing. Astronomy‚Äôs readers include those interested in astronomy and those who want to know about sky events, observing techniques, astrophotography, and amateur astronomy in general. Astronomy was founded in 1973 by Stephen A. Walther, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point and amateur astronomer. The first issue, August 1973, consisted of 48 pages with five feature articles and information about what to see in the sky that month. Issues contained astrophotos and illustrations created by astronomical artists. Walther had worked part time as a planetarium lecturer at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee and developed an interest in photographing constellations at an early age. Although even in childhood he was interested to obsession in Astronomy, he did so poorly in mathematics that his mother despaired that he would ever be able to earn a living. However he graduated in Journalism from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, and as a senior class project he created a business plan for a magazine for amateur astronomers. With the help of his brother David, he was able to bring the magazine to fruition.. He died in 1977. AstroMedia Corp., the company Walther had founded to publish Astronomy in Milwaukee, brought in Richard Berry as editor. Berry also created the offshoot Odyssey, aimed at young readers, and the specialized Telescope Making. In 1985, Milwaukee hobby publisher Kalmbach bought Astronomy. In 1992, Richard Berry left the magazine and Robert Burnham took over as chief editor. Kalmbach discontinued Deep Sky and Telescope Making magazines and sold Odyssey. In 1996 Bonnie Gordon, now a professor at Central Arizona College, assumed the editorship. David J. Eicher, the creator of \\"Deep Sky,\\" became chief editor in 2002. The Astronomy staff also produces other publications. These have included Explore the Universe; Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Astronomy; Origin and Fate of the Universe; Mars: Explore the Red Planet's Past, Present, and Future; Atlas of the Stars; Cosmos; and 50 Greatest Mysteries of the Universe. There also was, for a time in the mid-2000s, a Brazilian edition ‚Äì published by Duetto Editora ‚Äì called Astronomy Brasil. However, due mainly to low circulation numbers, Duetto ceased its publication in September 2007.  Articles and columns  Astronomy publishes articles about the hobby and science of astronomy. Generally, the front half of the magazine reports on professional science, while the back half of the magazine presents items of interest to hobbyists. Science articles cover such topics as cosmology, space exploration, exobiology, research conducted by professional- class observatories, and individual professional astronomers. Each issue of Astronomy contains a foldout star map showing the evening sky for the current month and the positions of planets, and some comets. The magazine has regular columnists. They include science writer Bob Berman, who writes a column called ‚ÄúBob Berman‚Äôs Strange Universe‚Äù. Stephen James O‚ÄôMeara writes ‚ÄúStephen James O‚ÄôMeara‚Äôs Secret Sky,‚Äù which covers observing tips and stories relating to deep-sky objects, planets, and comets. Glenn Chaple writes \\"Glenn Chaple‚Äôs Observing Basics\\", a beginner's column. Phil Harrington writes \\"Phil Harrington‚Äôs Binocular Universe\\", about observing with binoculars. \\"Telescope Insider\\" interviews people who are a part of the telescope-manufacturing industry. In each issue of Astronomy magazine, readers will find star and planet charts, telescope observing tips and techniques, and advice on taking photography of the night sky. The magazine also publishes reader-submitted photos in a gallery, lists astronomy-related events, letters from readers, news, and announcements of new products.

Euripides' title means \\"Iphigenia among the Taurians\\", whereas Goethe's title means \\"Iphigenia in Taurica\\", the country of the Tauri. Goethe wrote the first version of his play in six weeks, and it was first performed on April 6, 1779, in prose form. He rewrote it in 1781, again in prose, and finally in 1786 in verse form. He took the manuscript of Iphigenia in Tauris with him on his famous Italian Journey. Background Georg Oswald May, as reproduced on a 1949 German 10-Pfennig postage stamp Karl August as Pylades, and Corona Schr√∂ter as Iphigenia Beloved by the gods for his wisdom, the demigod Tantalus was once invited to their fellowship. Becoming boisterous whilst celebrating with them, he began to boast, and he stole the gods' nectar and ambrosia, their food of immortality. When the gods came to see Tantalus in turn, he tested their omniscience by offering his own son Pelops to them as their meal. Offended by the deception, the gods banished Tantalus from their community to Tartarus and cursed him and his family, the House of Atreus. This became known as the curse on the Tantalids, in which descendants from Tantalus in every subsequent generation were driven by revenge and hatred to the killing of their own family members. Thus did Agamemnon, army commander and great-grandson of Tantalus, offer his eldest daughter Iphigenia to goddess Diana (in Greek known as Artemis) to ensure favourable winds for the voyage from Aulis, modern Avlida, to Troy, where he intended to wage war against Troy. In the mistaken belief that her husband Agamemnon had murdered their daughter Iphigenia, Clytemnestra then killed Agamemnon. As a result, Orestes and Electra, the brother and sister of Iphigenia, harboured a grudge against the mother over the murder of their father, and Orestes, with the help of Electra, murdered his mother Clytemnestra. Being now guilty of a murder, he too fell under the family curse. In an attempt to flee his impending fate of falling victim to revenge and of being killed for his crime, he fled. Consulting the Delphic oracle of Apollo, he was told to bring \\"the sister\\" to Athens and that this would be the only way to lift the curse. Since he supposed his sister Iphigenia was already dead, Orestes assumed that the oracle must have meant Apollo's twin sister, the goddess Diana. He therefore planned to rob the statue of Diana from the temple in Tauris, and he set out with his old friend Pylades for the coast of Tauris. Synopsis =Act I= Scene 1: Since Diana saved her from death (her father Agamemnon chose to sacrifice her in return for a favourable wind for Troy), Iphigenia has been serving as her priestess on Tauris. Although she is grateful to the goddess, and although she is held in high regard by King Thoas and his people, she longs more and more to return to her homeland. :\\"And days together stand I on the shore, / seeking, in my soul, the land of Greece ..\\" She laments her life as a woman in a foreign land, recognising that her normal fate would have been to be tied to a husband. :\\"Woman's fate is lamentable ... / how narrow the limits to her happiness!\\" She begs Diana to reunite her with her family: :\\"And rescue me, you who rescued me from death, / from this, the second death that I am living here.\\" Scene 2: Arkas, the confidant of Thoas, King of Tauris, announces the King's arrival. Iphigenia admits her homesickness to him. Arkas reminds her of all the good she has done in Tauris, for example, ending the custom of sacrificing all strangers on Diana's altar. He explains that the King is coming to ask for her hand, and he advises her to accept. Iphigenia declines: marriage would tie her to Tauris for ever. Scene 3: Thoas makes his suit. Iphigenia justifies her refusal by her longing for Greece, and does her best to add other sound reasons, such as the curse that lies on her family, which condemns all the descendants of Tantalus to kill each other. She gives several examples. Thoas is not dissuaded, but Iphigenia now calls on Diana: :\\"Has not the goddess, who rescued me, / and she alone, the right to my dedicated life?\\" Thoas threatens to reintroduce the old custom of human sacrifice, which she would be obliged to carry out, rather than allow her to leave. Scene 4: Iphigenia prays to Diana: she places her faith in the goodness and justice of the Gods, and she begs her to spare her from having to sacrifice innocent victims. =Act II= Scene 1: Iphigenia's brother Orestes and his friend and cousin Pylades arrive, and we learn that they are following up an oracle of Apollo. Orestes has avenged his father by murdering his mother, and has been pursued ever since by the implacable Furies. So he has pleaded with Apollo to release him from their anger. Apollo has answered through his oracle at Delphi, saying that his guilt will be redeemed if he brings his sister back to Greece. He takes Apollo to mean his own sister, and so the two men have landed in Tauris to steal the statue of Diana from her temple. They have been discovered by the King's soldiers however, and taken prisoner. Orestes despairs, fearing that they will become human sacrifices.. Pylades encourages him, telling him about the kindly priestess who does not kill prisoners. Nevertheless, Orestes feels that their mission is hopeless. Scene 2: Iphigenia speaks with Pylades, who does not reveal his name. He pretends that he and Orestes are brothers, and that Orestes has killed their brother. Iphigenia questions him about Greece. He tells her of the fall of Troy and the death of many Greek heroes. His account increases her homesickness and her desire to see her father Agamemnon again. But Pylades tells her that Agamemnon has been murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, in revenge for Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter. Iphigenia leaves in dismay. =Act III= Scene 1: Iphigenia promises Orestes, whose name she still does not know, to do all in her power to save him and Pylades from being sacrificed to Diana. She asks about Agamemnon's children (her siblings). Orestes tells her of Clytemnestra's murder, stabbed by Orestes at Electra's urging, and reveals his true identity, because he cannot bear Iphigenia's distress at this news: Let there be truth between us: I am Orestes. Iphigenia is happy to have found her brother again, and makes herself known in turn. Orestes decides nevertheless that he should die to appease the Furies; Iphigenia and Pylades should save themselves. He keeps the oracle's words to himself. At the end of the scene he falls unconscious to the ground. Scene 2: Orestes has a vision of Hades. He sees his dead forebears in the Tantalus line happily forgiven in the underworld. This vision perhaps contributes to his healing, since it reveals to him the possibility of forgiveness after death. Scene 3: Orestes wakes, but still believes himself to be in Hades, and thinks that Iphigenia and Pylades have descended there too. He pities his friend and wishes that his sister Electra were also in the underworld, so that she too can be free of the curse. Iphigenia and Pylades come to him, to heal him. In a prayer, Iphigenia thanks Diana and asks that Orestes may be released from the curse. Pylades tries to reason with him. When Orestes finally wakes from his dream (The curse is lifted, my heart assures me), he embraces Iphigenia, thanks the gods, and declares himself ready for action again. Pylades reminds them both of the need for haste which their danger imposes on them, and urges them to a quick conclusion. =Act IV= Scene 1: While Orestes and Pylades prepare a boat for their escape, Iphigenia is troubled by the need to deceive the King. Scene 2: Arkas brings the King's command to hasten the sacrifice: Iphigenia tells him that the prisoner's bloodguilt has polluted the temple, and that she must first purify it. They argue over the King's right to command, and the priestess's right to interpret the will of the Goddess. Arkas leaves to report to the King. Scene 3: Iphigenia reflects on her dilemma and the need to decide between the joy of escaping with her brother and the need to deceive and abandon the King, who has been good to her. Scene 4: Pylades announces that Orestes is in good spirits, that the boat is ready, and urges her to hurry. She still hesitates, even though Pylades points out that she would have an even worse conscience if Orestes and he were killed. Scene 5: In the Song of the Fates she recalls the pitiless vengeance of the Gods. Still, she adds a verse indicating that she does not entirely accept the Song of the Fates. =Act V= Scene 1: Arkas reports to Thoas, who commands him to bring the priestess before him at once. Scene 2: Thoas reflects that his goodness to Iphigenia has encouraged her independence. Scene 3: Iphigenia tells the angry Thoas that having experienced mercy when she was to be sacrificed, she is obliged to be merciful now. She argues that a woman's words can be as powerful as a man's sword; she tells him who the prisoners are, who she is, and of their plan to escape; and she appeals to his humanity. He begins to concede. Scene 4: Orestes arrives, sword in hand, and urges Iphigenia to flee with him. She reveals that she has confessed to the King. Scene 5: Pylades and Arkas arrive; the King orders a halt to the fighting. Scene 6: Orestes offers himself in single combat, to decide their fate. Thoas himself is willing to accept the challenge, and is unpersuaded by Iphigenia's reasoning, especially because she had been party to the plan to steal the statue of Diana. Orestes explains his misunderstanding of the oracle's reference to a sister. The King reluctantly allows them to go; Iphigenia begs that they part as friends; and the King finally wishes them Farewell.

The book is based on Goethe's diaries and is smoothed in style, lacks the spontaneity of his diary report and is augmented with the addition of afterthoughts and reminiscences. At the beginning of September 1786, when Goethe had just turned 37, he \\"slipped away\\", in his words, from his duties as Privy Councillor in the Duchy of Weimar, from a long platonic affair with a court lady and from his immense fame as the author of the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther and the stormy play G√∂tz von Berlichingen, and he took what became a licensed leave of absence. By May 1788 he had travelled to Italy via Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass and visited Lake Garda, Verona, Vicenza, Venice, Bologna, Rome and Alban Hills, Naples and Sicily. He wrote many letters to a number of friends in Germany, which he later used as the basis for Italian Journey. Appraisal :Et in Arcadia egoGoethe's epigraph for the book (Engl. ed.), although originally in German: Auch ich in Arkadien. Italian Journey initially takes the form of a diary, with events and descriptions written up apparently quite soon after they were experienced. The impression is in one sense true, since Goethe was clearly working from journals and letters he composed at the time ‚Äî and by the end of the book he is openly distinguishing between his old correspondence and what he calls reporting.For text references and relevant commentary, cf. the specialist Folio Society edition of Goethe's Italian Journey (hereafter I.J.), London: Folio Society (2010) ‚Äî translated and introduced by W. H. Auden and Elizabeth Mayer, published by arrangement with their estates, and HarperCollins Publishers (1962 ed.). Excerpts from I.J. are translated from the original German text, available at Project Gutenberg, Italienische Reise. But there is also a strong and indeed elegant sense of fiction about the whole, a sort of composed immediacy. Goethe said in a letter that the work was \\"both entirely truthful and a graceful fairy-tale\\". It had to be something of a fairy-tale, since it was written between thirty and more than forty years after the journey, in 1816 and 1828-29.Cf. \\"Introduction\\" by Auden & Mayer (hereinafter A&M;), op. cit., pp. xx-xxi. The work beginsIn the specific English edition, cit. with a famous Latin tag, Et in Arcadia ego, although originally Goethe used the German translation, Auch ich in Arkadien, which alters the meaning. This Latin phrase is usually imagined as spoken by Death ‚Äî this is its sense, for example, in W. H. Auden's poem called \\"Et in Arcadia ego\\" ‚Äî suggesting that every paradise is afflicted by mortality. Conversely, what Goethe's Auch ich in Arkadien says is \\"Even I managed to get to paradise\\", with the implication that we could all get there if we chose. If death is universal, the possibility of paradise might be universal too. This possibility wouldn't preclude its loss, and might even require it, or at least require that some of us should lose it. The book ends with a quotation from Ovid's Tristia, regretting his expulsion from Rome. Cum repeto noctem, Goethe writes in the middle of his own German, as well as citing a whole passage: \\"When I remember the night...\\"I.J., p. 499: Ovid's Tristia, Book III ‚Äî Cum subit illius tristissima noctis imago,/Quae mihi supremum tempus in Urbe fuit,/Cum repeto noctem, qua tot mihi cara reliqui;/Labitur ex oculis nunc quoque gutta meis./Iamque quiescebant voces hominumque canumque:/Lunaque nocturnos alta regebat equos./Hanc ego suspiciens, et ab hac Capitolia cernens,/Quae nostro frustra iuncta fuere Lari. He is already storing up not only plentiful nostalgia and regret, but also a more complicated treasure: the certainty that he didn't merely imagine the land where others live happily ever after.Cf. A&M;, op. cit., pp. xii-xiii. Content \\"We are all pilgrims who seek Italy\\", Goethe wrote in a poem two years after his return to Germany from his almost two-year spell in the land he had long dreamed of. For Goethe, Italy was the warm passionate south as opposed to the dank cautious north; the place where the classical past was still alive, although in ruins; a sequence of landscapes, colours, trees, manners, cities, monuments he had so far seen only in his writing. He described himself as \\"the mortal enemy of mere words\\" or what he also called \\"empty names\\". He needed to fill the names with meaning and, as he rather strangely put it, \\"to discover myself in the objects I see\\", literally \\"to learn to know myself by or through the objects\\". He also writes of his old habit of \\"clinging to the objects\\", which pays off in the new location. He wanted to know that what he thought might be paradise actually existed, even if it wasn't entirely paradise, and even if he didn't in the end want to stay there.Cf. A&M;, op. cit., pp. xi-xiv. Portrait of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe by Angelica Kauffmann, 1787 While in Italy, Goethe aspired to witness and to breathe the conditions and milieu of a once highly ‚Äî and in certain respects still ‚Äî cultured area endowed with many significant works of art. Apart from the impetus to study the Mediterranean's natural qualities, he was first and foremost interested in the remains of classical antiquity and in contemporary art. During his stay in Assisi, he did not visit the famous Giotto frescoes in the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. Many critics have questioned this strange choice. In Verona, where he enthusiastically commends the harmony and fine proportions of the city amphitheater; he asserts this is the first true piece of Classical art he has witnessed. Venice, too, holds treasures for his artistic education, and he soon becomes fascinated by the Italian style of living. After a very short stop in Florence, he arrives in Rome. It was here that he met several respected German artists, and made friends with Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein and notable Neoclassical painter, Angelica Kauffman. Tischbein painted one of the most famous portraits of Goethe, Goethe in the Roman Campagna, and accompanied him to Naples. During the journey, the two later separated due to their \\"incompatible\\" interests. After leaving Rome and entering Palermo, Goethe searched for what he called \\"Urpflanze\\", a plant that would be the archetype of all plants. In his journal, Goethe shows a marked interest in the geology of Europe's southern regions. He demonstrates a depth and breadth of knowledge in each subject. Most frequently, he pens descriptions of mineral and rock samples that he retrieves from the mountains, crags, and riverbeds of Italy. He also undertakes several dangerous hikes to the summit of Mount Vesuvius, where he catalogues the nature and qualities of various lava flows and tephra. He is similarly adept at recognizing species of plant and flora, which stimulate thought and research into his botanical theories.Cf. A&M;, op. cit., pp. xi- xxiii. While more credibility can be attributed to his scientific investigations, Goethe maintains a thoughtful and admiring interest in art. Using Palladio and Johann Joachim Winkelmann as touchstones for his artistic growth, Goethe expands his scope of thought in regards to Classical concepts of beauty and the characteristics of good architecture. Indeed, in his letters he periodically comments on the growth and good that Rome has caused in him. The profusion of high-quality objects of art proves critical in his transformation during these two years away from his hometown in Germany. =Rome and Naples= The Gulf of Naples from Vesuvius, by Goethe's artist friend Christoph Heinrich Kniep Goethe visited Paestum accompanied by painter Christoph Heinrich Kniep, who was introduced to him by the artist Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein; Kniep will produce several drawings for Goethe and will go with him to Sicily. Goethe stayed almost three months in Rome, which he described as \\"the First City of the World\\".I.J., p. 116. His company was a group of young German painters; he sketched and did watercolours, visited famous sites, rewrote his play Iphigenia, and thought about his Collected Works, already in progress back home.Cf. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe bibliography. He could look back now on what he called his \\"salto mortale\\" (somersault), his bid for freedom, and he had explained himself in letters to his mistress and friends. But he couldn't settle. Rome was full of remains, but too much was gone. \\"Architecture rises out of its grave like a ghost.\\" All he could do was \\"revere in silence the noble existence of past epochs which have perished for ever.\\"I.J., pp. 121-122. It is at this point, as Nicholas Boyle puts it clearly in the first volume of his biography,Cf. Nicholas Boyle, Goethe: The Poet and the Age: Volume I: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790) (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991). Goethe began to think of turning his \\"flight to Rome... into an Italian journey\\". From February to May 1787 he was in Naples and Sicily. He climbed Vesuvius, visited Pompeii, found himself contrasting Neapolitan gaiety with Roman solemnity. He was amazed that people could actually live in the way he had only imagined living and in an emotional passage he wrote: > Naples is a paradise; everyone lives in a state of intoxicated self- > forgetfulness, myself included. I seem to be a completely different person > whom I hardly recognise. Yesterday I thought to myself: Either you were mad > before, or you are mad now.I.J., p. 198. and about the sights: > One may write or paint as much as one likes, but this place, the shore, the > gulf, Vesuvius, the citadels, the villas, everything, defies > description.I.J., p. 176. > I can't begin to tell you of the glory of a night by full moon when we > strolled through the streets and squares to the endless promenade of the > Chiaia, and then walked up and down the seashore. I was quite overwhelmed by > the feeling of infinite space. To be able to dream like this is certainly > worth the trouble it took to get here.I.J., p. 182.

He commanded the Third Netherlands Division that intervened at a crucial moment in the Battle of Waterloo. In 1830 he bombarded the city of Antwerp as commander of Antwerp Citadel during the Belgian Revolution.  Biography  = Family life = Chass√© was the son of Carel Johan Chass√©, a scion of an old Huguenot family, who was a major in the army of the Dutch Republic, and of Maria Johanna Helena Schull. He married Johanna Adriana van Nieuwenhoven on 10 November 1786 and divorced her in 1795. His second marriage was to the English widow Elisabeth Irish on 12 April 1796. They had one son. This marriage also ended in divorce in 1816.Gabri√´ls, op. cit. = Early career = Chass√© entered the Dutch army as a ten-year-old cadet in his father's regiment in 1775. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1781. He resigned his commission in 1786 because of his sympathy for the Patriot party in their opposition to the autocratic regime of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange. Instead he became a captain in a Patriot Free Corps, defending Muiden and Weesp against the Prussian invaders that restored William to power in 1787. Because of this role in the revolt he had to go into exile in France, as many other Patriots. Another reason for going abroad was that he had killed a man in a duel.Gabri√´ls, op. cit. In 1788 Chass√© received a commission as a first lieutenant in the royal French army. After the revolution of 1789 he took part in the campaigns of the revolutionary French armies as a captain in the L√©gion franche √©trang√®re (Free foreign legion). He received a wound in the right upper arm in 1794 that would make writing difficult for the rest of his life. As a lieutenant-colonel, Chass√©'s battalion formed the vanguard of the French attack on the Bommelerwaard and the capture of Zaltbommel, shortly before the fall of the Dutch Republic in January 1795.Uythoven, op. cit. = Batavian Republic and Kingdom of Holland = Chass√© now entered the service of the Batavian Republic as commander of a regiment of light infantry. He usually performed garrison duties, but was in 1799 part of the Franco-Dutch army that drove the Anglo- Russian expeditionary force from North Holland. In the early 19th century he commanded regiments that took part in the French campaigns in northern Germany that the Batavian army was compelled to join. He was mentioned in dispatches at the siege of W√ºrzburg in 1810. He was promoted to colonel in 1803 and to major-general in 1806 under the Kingdom of Holland. King Louis Bonaparte put him in command of the Dutch brigade (part of the Division-Leval) that his brother Napoleon obliged him to contribute to the French campaign in Spain in 1808. For his exploits in that harsh guerilla war in the battles of Pancorbo (better known by the French as Durango; 1808), Mesas de Ibor (1809), Talavera (1809), Almonacid (1809) and Ocana (1809; where he assumed command of the Division-Leval),Uythoven, op. cit. King Louis created Chass√© baron on 1 July 1810, just one week before Napoleon annexed the Kingdom of Holland to the French Empire. Like many Dutchmen, Chass√© resented this annexation, so much so, that he refused to accept the diplome in which Napoleon elevated him to baron de l'Empire on 30 June 1811. Nevertheless, he continued serving in the army that now became part of the imperial French army.Gabri√´ls, op. cit. = French army service = He was now made a g√©n√©ral de brigade in that French army (a demotion), serving in the army corps of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon in Spain. As such he fought in the Battle of Vitoria and the Battle of Maya, where he saved the French army.Mulli√©, op. cit. For this feat he was made an officer in the L√©gion d'honneur and nominated by d'Erlon for promotion to lieutenant-general in the imperial army.Uythoven, op. cit. Napoleon affectionately called him \\"g√©n√©ral baionette\\" for his fierceness and his predilection for bayonet attacks. In 1814 Chass√© was transferred to the Champagne theatre of war where he joined the Division Boyer as commander of its 2nd Brigade. He fought in the battles of Bar-sur-Aube and Arcis-sur-Aube, where he was wounded. He directed the defense of Sens on 3 April 1814. However, after the fall of Paris and Napoleon's first abdication he had had enough and asked to be released from French service. This was granted with the rank of lieutenant-general on 6 October 1814.Uythoven, op. cit. He now returned to the Netherlands which had become independent again. The sovereign prince William I of the Netherlands was keen to engage the services of such an experienced general, and had no doubts about his loyalty. Chass√© was commissioned as a major-general in the new Mobile Netherlands Army on 22 October 1814. He was made commander of the Third NetherlandsThis division was made up of Dutch and Belgian troops; it is therefore inappropriate to speak of \\"Dutch\\" division. Division on 25 March 1815 and promoted to lieutenant-general on 21 April.Uythoven, op. cit. = Battle of Waterloo = At the battle of Waterloo Chass√©'s third division was part of the First Netherlands Corps under the Prince of Orange in the right-center of the Duke of Wellington's Anglo- Allied army. As Wellington, who had often fought against Chass√© in Spain, was still apprehensive about his military skillIn a confidential assessment of the Netherlands army of April 2, 1815, entitled \\"Memorandum relative to the Dutch Army,\\" the anonymous drafter writes about Chass√©: \\"Pourquois ne pas √©loigner ces G√©n√©raux inutiles et dangereux, tel que M. Chass√©, Storm de Grave, Matusowitz, gens sans moyens, et des plus mauvaises principes? ‚Ä¶ partout il seroit mieux, et moins dans le cas de faire du mal, que sur la fronti√®re de la France, ou ils se trouvent actuellement.\\" (1863) Supplementary Despatches and Memoranda of Field Marshal Arthur, Duke of Wellington, K. G., Vol. 10, p. 17 , the third division was placed in reserve behind the right wing. When around 7.30 p.m., in the final part of the battle, Chass√© noticed that the fire of the artillery in front of him slackened. In response he ordered Major Van der Smissen to send the Horse artillery battery 'Krahmer' Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin into the firing line. It was at this moment that Napoleon sent his Imperial Guards to attack the center. In preparation for the second counterattack Chass√© ordered the Detmers brigade (part of the division) to take position behind Van der Smissen. His counterattack was to be a bayonet charge, as Chass√© had a predilection for this type of manoeuvre (that had earned him the nickname of \\"g√©n√©ral baionette\\" from Napoleon). The murderous fire of Jacques van Smissen, battery of Horse-artillery, and the bayonet attack of the Detmers brigade, against the Imperial Guard.\\"Lettre du lieutenant g√©n√©ral baron Chass√© a S.A.R. le prince d'Orange, le 4 juillet 1815,\\" in (1908/9) La Campagne de 1815 aux Pays-Bas d'apr√®s les rapports officiels n√©erlandais, tome III, pp. 354‚Äì358; and the supporting reports of Col. Van Delen and Col. Detmers, op. cit, pp. 358‚Äì380For his part in the battle Chass√© was made a knight-commander in the Military William Order on 8 July 1815.Uythoven, op. cit. = Belgian Revolution = After Waterloo Chass√© was given several high commands. After the beginning of the Belgian Revolution he replaced Prince Frederick of the Netherlands as commander-in-chief of Dutch forces in Belgium on 17 October 1830. The next day he ordered the retreat to the fortified area around Antwerp. As commander of the citadel of Antwerp he ordered the bombardment of that city after an incident, the exact cause of which is still in dispute, on 27 October 1830. Whatever the provocation, the large loss of civilian life this bombardment caused seems hard to justify. The resentment it caused among Antwerp civilians helped lose Antwerp for the Dutch cause. Nevertheless, the citadel remained in Dutch hands, and Chass√© its commander. In 1832 (by now a full general) he commanded a garrison of 5,000 Dutch troops that was besieged by a French army under Marshal G√©rard ten times that number. Despite this superiority, and the fact that the citadel was bombarded day and night by the French, the garrison held out for twenty-four days, before Chass√© was finally forced to surrender.Mulli√©, op. cit. This earned him a knight's-grand cross in the Military William Order by promotion, and the admiration of the French, who made his imprisonment in Saint-Omer as pleasant as feasible.Mulli√©, op. cit. He was released as a prisoner of war in June 1833 and appointed governor of the fortress of Breda that same month. After the peace with Belgium in 1839 Chass√© finally retired. He was at first promised his full salary as a general for life, but this was reduced to the usual pension after government economies in 1841. King William I had appointed him a member for life of the First Chamber of the States-General in 1839 (which supplemented his income for a while), but after life memberships of that Senate were abolished by the constitutional reform of 1848 he lost that income also. He therefore had to sell his beloved horses. Chass√© died a few months later, aged 84. He was almost alone at his death, because his only son had predeceased him. His relatives declined a state funeral at his wish. He was laid to rest in Ginneken, now part of Breda, in a very simple burial.Gabri√´ls, op. cit.

Though the content is undated, it is arranged in approximately chronological order. It was published in hardcover by Riverhead Books in November 2002, and in paperback by Riverhead Books in November 2003. Journals opened at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list (non-fiction). It contains scrawled notes, drafted letters, shopping lists, and drawings by Cobain.Lyric sheets which originally appeared in Michael Azerrad's book Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana were airbrushed in portions upon their reprinting in Journals. This included removal of addresses and phone numbers. Release Journals was released one month after the release of the self-titled greatest hits album, Nirvana, in 2002, Cobain's band before he had committed suicide in 1994. Billboard thus described the book as a \\"music driven blockbuster\\" with a first printing of nearly 375,000 copies. Letters Journals contains a number of letters, either early drafts or unsent, that Cobain wrote to friends or peers. Included are friendly letters to Dale Crover of the Melvinshandwritten text, page 1, Tobi Vail of Bikini Killhandwritten text, pages 167-172 and Eugene Kelly of the Vaselineshandwritten text, page 92, a tender letter to his wife, Courtney Love, a letter thanking The Advocate following his interview with the gay and lesbian magazine in early 1992, and even a letter to Simon Fair Timony, the then-9-year-old stepson of Half Japanese member Jad Fair, asking him to contribute artwork for what would become In Utero. It also includes a letter from Cobain and Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic firing then-drummer Dave Foster from the band, and angry letters from Cobain to MTV and Rolling Stone. Lists Like many music fans, Cobain often made lists of his favorite bands and albums, several of which are included in Journals. His lists included artists from indie and alternative rock (the Vaselines, Pixies, the Breeders, Sonic Youth, R.E.M., PJ Harvey, Meat Puppets); protopunk, punk rock and hardcore (The Stooges, the Velvet Underground, Butthole Surfers, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Slits, The Saintspage 257, \\"top 50\\": Know Your Product - The Saints, Black Flag, Bad Brains, Fear, Minor Threat, The Faith, Rites of Spring, Flipper, Fang); hip-hop (Public Enemy, N.W.A); blues (Lead Belly); and hard rock and metal (Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC,). On his \\"Top 50\\" albums listhandwritten text, page 257, offerings from such obscure artists as The Shaggs, Tales of Terror, Marine Girls, Swans and The Frogs coexist with albums by The Beatles, David Bowie, and Aerosmith. The 1973 Stooges record Raw Power is listed at #1 on all of Cobain's \\"favorite album\\" lists. He also noted an interest in grunge and the Seattle Sound (The Melvins, Green River, Mudhoney, Screaming Trees, early Soundgarden). Nirvana-related writings Contained in Journals is an assortment of directly Nirvana-related material, including embryonic lyric draftshandwritten text: Smells Like Teen Spirit: pages 136-138, 141; Lithium: page 140; In Bloom: pages 142-144, etc, early album tracklists, and even a set of unused liner notes Cobain had apparently written for In Utero in 1993. The lyric sheets are especially revealing, showing that some songs, including the band's biggest hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", underwent major revisions before being recorded for release, while others, such as \\"Come as You Are\\", were changed very little, at least from the drafts included. The tracklists are also of interest, revealing, for example, that Cobain had intended to release \\"girl\\" and \\"boy\\" sides of Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind, with songs such as \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Lithium\\" on the girl side, and songs like \\"Sliver\\" and \\"Polly\\" on the boy side. Drawings Journals contains a number of Cobain's rough sketches and drawingspages 5, 14, 24, 32, 40, etc, some of which are light and humorous, such as his drawing of \\"Eddie\\", the Iron Maiden mascot, his sketch of the band as choirboys on a hypothetical Nirvana album cover, and his drawing of \\"Elvis Cooper\\", in which Elvis Presley and Alice Cooper are combined into a single entity, but many of which are darker or more violent. Included in the latter are his drawings of a sniper shooting members of the swastika-toting Ku Klux Klan from a rooftop (with swastikas drawn backwards), his drawing of a soldier with a football helmet hanging from a noose, and a sketch of his own emaciated body, as well as a comic strip called \\"Mr. Moustache\\", in which an unborn child kicks through its mother's belly to kill its macho father, which arguably influenced the song of the same title off of Nirvana's first album, Bleach. The strip was first published in Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography, Come as You Are. Journals also contains a number of drawings of images which would later become a familiar part of Nirvana lore, such as Dante's Vestibule of Hell (which appeared on a Nirvana t-shirt), a skinny man on a cross (which appeared in the \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" music video), and male seahorses giving birth (which appeared on the cover of the \\"All Apologies\\"/ \\"Rape Me\\" single).  Cobain's Journal Entries About His Health  Throughout his life, Cobain was physically fragile and sickly; suffering from scoliosis, undiagnosed stomach ailments (which some argue led to his heroin addiction), and a touring schedule that required him to spend hours each night singing, screaming and stage diving.Wood, Jessica L. \\"Pained Expression: Metaphors of Sickness and Signs of 'Authenticity' in Kurt Cobain's 'Journals.'\\" Popular Music, vol. 30, no. 3, 2011, pp. 331-349. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23359907. On top of his physical issues, he was diagnosed with clinical depression during his teenage years.Strauss, Neil. \\"Kurt Cobain's Downward Spiral and Last Days.\\" Rolling Stone, Rolling Stone, 2 June 1994, www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kurt-cobains-downard-spiral-the-last- days-of-nirvanas-leader-19940602. In his private journals, that were later published after his death, Cobain details the horrific stomach pain he experienced. He says that eating was always followed by a relentless, \\"burning nauseous pain in the upper part of my [his] stomach lining\\".Cobain, Kurt. Journals. Riverhead Books, 2003. He writes that the pain would, at times, leave him crunched up in his bathroom floor, paralyzed by the discomfort, continuously regurgitating nothing but blood and water. Though the root of his gastrointestinal issues was never determined, and close friends of Cobain argue that it was simply an excuse for his heroin habit, no one can deny the fact that he suffered tremendously.\\"Buzz Osborne (the Melvins) Talks the HBO Documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\\". Talkhouse. Retrieved 2018-04-28. Other bandmates have later recalled Cobain's strange fascination with bodily functions. During a 1989 Nirvana tour, one of the band's singers, Tad Doyle, suffered from daily nausea and vomiting episodes; Kurt Danielson, a close friend of Doyle's, recalls that Cobain would voluntarily hold a bucket for Doyle to vomit into and often appeared excited to see the end result.Cross, Charles R. Heavier Than Heaven: a Biography of Kurt Cobain.Hachette Books, 2001. Danielson remembers that Cobain admired Doyle for his struggle, and viewed his sickness as artistic and authentic. Cobain's obsession with bodily fluids can be more publicly seen in his graphic song lyrics; from sex, to urination, to vomiting, almost 90% of his songs and art were somehow influenced by the human body. In his journal entries, Cobain would often misspell words and put an anatomical twist on his spelling of a word. Reception Seattle Weekly News said this: \\"The journals are like an exploded diagram of a tormented soul, a maelstrom of self-pity, intolerant pride, morbid introspection, ingenious self-delusion, merciless self- knowledge, showbiz revulsion, starstruck effusion, Faustian ambition, otherworldly detachment, and an iron will helpless to help itself. Packed into 280 pages are shocking confessions, sweetly eloquent letters to brilliant friends, hard-nosed band plans, fulminating political screeds, obscene cartoons, haunting video treatments, and lyrical poetry of tremulous Romantic sensitivity, Bukowskian crudity, dadaist flippancy, and modernist opacity.\\" Furthermore, its release reportedly polarized fans, some of whom felt it constituted an invasion of Cobain's privacy, and others of whom saw it as a unique opportunity to better understand him. Billboard reported that the simultaneous release of the Nirvana hits set helped fire cross-promotion at retail and that the album release was providence.

It is the third game in the Galaxian series, serving as a direct sequel to Galaga (1981). In North America a modification kit was later released to change the name to Galaga 3, possibly to increase recognition, even though there was no \\"Galaga 2\\". It was the only other game to run on Namco Phozon hardware. A contemporary home port for the Commodore 64 was released in 1988. A Nintendo Entertainment System port of the game was created and included in Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2 as a bonus title. Gameplay The player shooting down formations of enemies Galaga 3 conversion kit marquee Gaplus is a sequel to Galaga and has similar gameplay. The player controls a spaceship, that can now move vertically (limited to halfway up the screen, much like Atari's Centipede) as well as horizontally, and shoots at swarms of incoming insect- like aliens which fly in formation above it and swoop down to attack it in a kamikaze-like dive. In this sequel, the level starts over if the player gets killed before all the enemies have come in. When all enemies are killed, the player moves on to the next level. By obtaining certain powerups, it is possible to shoot sixty bullets per screen, the most any Galaxian-related game has. The game differs from its predecessors in several ways (including the fact that the appearance of the enemies changes every ten levels): *By shooting at a shooting star that occasionally appears, the player can get a ship with new graphics that can have three shots on screen instead of two (known as the \\"Hypership\\"). After this, shooting the star will make a \\"special flag\\" from Rally-X appear, which will award the player an extra life when collected. A similar \\"triple\\" ship would later go on to appear in Galaga '88. *On certain levels (referred to as parsecs in the game) the scrolling of the starfield changes: instead of scrolling from the top to the bottom of the screen, it either scrolls from bottom-to-top or side-to-side. This is accompanied by dramatic music and some groups of enemies attacking in waves, leaving the playfield if not shot. After this, a small squadron appears in formation, as in a normal level. *The challenging stages are different from those for Galaga - enemies are juggled by shooting them, each hit slowly spelling out (in order as the game progresses): \\"Bonus\\", \\"Gaplus\\", \\"Double\\", \\"Triple\\", \\"Good!!\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Bye Bye\\", and \\"Extend\\"; shots that hit enemies after the word has been spelled out each award an extra 200 points (indicated by up to four rows of green bees that appear above the word; the total number of bonus hits allowed varies from challenging stage to challenging stage). It is most effective to use the red and blue Blaster Heads to repeatedly hit them. Some challenging stages also have an additional bonus awarded after the word has been spelled and the bonus calculated. For example, on a challenging stage where \\"Gaplus\\" is spelled out, the player is instructed to press the firing button, for an additional bonus; the award is between 10,000 and 40,000 points, in multiples of 10,000; on the \\"Good!!\\" level, this bonus extends to a potential 70,000 points. On the \\"Lucky\\" level, a bonus ship piece will be awarded; however, on the \\"Bye Bye\\" level a bonus ship piece will be taken away (or 10,000 points, if the player has no ship pieces), and on the \\"Extend\\" level, an extra life is awarded * At stages over 10 and up, shooting the enemy causes them to turn into a deadly energy cube that cannot be destroyed but can destroy the player. *The \\"Boss Galaga\\" from Galaga returns as the King Gaplus - a single enemy who sits at the top of the alien formation. He typically carries an item which can be obtained if he is destroyed while attacking. One type of item is a series of ship upgrades called \\"Blaster Heads\\", which are as follows: the red Phalanx captures enemies with a tractor beam where each one provides another shot; the blue Hyper gives wider and faster shots, an upgraded version of the \\"double\\" ship from Galaga; the green Cyclone captures enemies in a tractor beam that can then be shot for bonus points; the purple Elephant is temporary and slows all enemies down, but not their shots; the grey Sidewinder allows the player to direct his or her shots left and right as they move; finally, the rare yellow Stardust is temporary and turns all enemy shots into harmless stars. All of these powerups may be stacked on top of one another - greatly increasing the player's maximum firepower. If the King does not have one of these powerups, he may instead carry one of three parts for the player's ship. When obtained, these parts will get placed in the bottom- right corner of the screen; an extra life is awarded after all three are collected. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Gaplus on their May 15, 1984 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy Gaplus is included in Namco Museum Vol. 2. It was also released on mobile phones, and is also part of Namco Museum Remix (2007) and Namco Museum Megamix (2010) for the Wii with its original title being used. The original version was later re-released under its original name for the Wii Virtual Console on March 25, 2009. In 2011, Gaplus was released for iOS devices as part of Galaga 30th Collection, featuring updated visuals, sound, and achievements. A Nintendo Entertainment System port of Gaplus was created by M2 and included in the compilation Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2 as a bonus game, alongside a demake of Pac-Man Championship Edition.

Headbands generally consist of a loop of elastic material or a horseshoe-shaped piece of flexible plastic or metal. They come in assorted shapes and sizes and are used for both fashion and practical or utilitarian purposes. In the UK, horseshoe-shaped headbands are sometimes called \\"Alice bands\\" after the headbands that Alice is often depicted wearing in Through the Looking-Glass.Chambers 21st Century Dictionary Allied Publishers Tartessian gold headband from the Iron Age History =Greeks and Romans= The beginning of headbands was no later than around 475 BC to 330 BC, with the ancient Greeks, who wore hair wreaths. The Greeks and Romans wore these pieces for very special occasions or an important event. Cultures such as the Etruscans and Romans started to decorate their wreaths with jewels made up of gold and silver. While wreaths are certainly a likely beginning of today's headbands, some believe that current day hair bands have slowly taken shape from scarves that were worn around the head or were modified from the band of hats that tied under the chin. =Jews= In the ancient times, Jews originally wore headbands, besides turbans, and keffiyehs as their traditional clothing. In modern times, these Jewish fashions are worn by Mizrahi Jews only. =Sikhs= A turban is a symbol of royalty, spirituality, dignity, self-respect and courage. The turban is part of the Sikh religious identity. Male Khalsa Sikhs [the initiated Sikhs] must wear a turban. Some Khalsa Sikh women also wear a turban. In general, all Sikhs are expected to wear a turban. Some Sikhs who cut their hair (called Mona Sikhs) also wear turbans occasionally when attending a wedding, religious ceremony or when attending a social gathering. A Khalsa Sikh is not allowed to cut hair from any part of his/her body. This applies to men and women. In some universities in India, for example, Jammu University, it is mandatory to wear a turban for the degree-granting officials during a convocation function. A Sikh turban is not a headband. It is a symbol of self- respect, spirituality, and royalty. A full turban length is usually between 5 and 8 yards in length, but it has no fixed length. The styles of turban also vary among the Sikhs. Some wear a round turban (traditional dumala style), some wear the Sikh army style, and some Sikhs wear more modern style turbans. Some Sikhs wear a smaller turban called Keski. A Baptized (initiated Sikh) does not go out in public without covering his head with either a small or large turban. The five articles of the Sikh faith are Kesh (unshorn hair), Kachehra (special breeches or drawers), Kangha (wooden comb usually tucked in long hair of the Sikhs), Karha (iron bracelet), and Kirpan (sword). These are called \\"5 Kakars\\" or \\" 5 Ks\\" in Sikhism. Some Sikhs believe that Keski (small turban) is one of the five required articles of faith because they believe unshorn hair is God-given. Turban is worn by the Muslims and Hindus as well, but it is not mandatory for them. It is mandatory for a practicing Sikh. About 99.99 per cent of people wearing a turban in the western world are Sikhs. There is no restriction on the color of turban among the Sikhs, but the more religiously appropriate turban colors for the Sikhs are: 1\\\\. Kesri (yellow with orange tinge) 2\\\\. Blue (dark blue or navy blue) 3\\\\. Black 4\\\\. White Once they enter the gates of the inner court, They are to wear linen vestments; They shall wear linen turbans, And linen drawers on their loins. \\"The word turban is found in this form in European languages only - English turban, turband; French turban, tulband; German: turban; Italian, Spanish and Portuguese: turbante; Dutch: turband; Rumanian: tulipan; and it is generally traced to Persian, sarband. In Turkish sarik is the usual name of turban.\\" One of the commands of God to Moses was to wear a turban as the symbol of prophethood, holiness and divine power; a command which was obeyed by the Jews and the Muslims for centuries and ignored or forgotten by the Christians.Dr. Trilochan Singh. The Turban and the Sword of the Sikhs (Amritsar: Bhai Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh, 1977), p. 32 =Early 20th century= In the early 20th century, wide headbands known as headache bands were very popular accessories in women's fashion. Their name came from the belief that the tight pressure they provided around the forehead could relieve or prevent headaches. The French called such a garment a bandeau (bandeaux, plural). In the 1910s, headache bands would likely have been more lacy in design‚Äîa crochet central panel decorated with ribbons and rosettes and bordered with lace, for example. Examples from the 1920s and 1930s are more apt to be dramatic sheaths in exotic fabrics and decorated with feathers, and would have been worn with fashions by couturiers such as Paul Poiret. These sorts of headache bands probably achieved their peak of popularity in the 1920s. Today, items called headache bands are apt to be strictly utilitarian and medical in focus. During the same period, jewelled headache bands or headbands, often in precious metals and precious gems, were popular. =1960s= During the 1950s and 1960s, many glamorous young women in Britain and the US wore plastic headbands with the beehive hairstyle, or silk veils when driving. At the same time, working-class women wrapped strips of cloth around their hair as protection from the industrial smog and dirty rain. =1970s= After the Summer of Love of 1967, hippies wore tie dye and paisley bandanas as headbands in imitation of Leftist activists and guerrillas. These were also worn by many hard rock and heavy metal guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Keith Richards, Ted Nugent, Bruce Springsteen, or Link Wray during the early and mid 70s to keep cool on stage. =1980s= Deely boppers were a fad in 1982. Princess Diana famously wore an emerald and diamond choker as a headband in Melbourne on the occasion of a state tour of Australia in 1985. Symbolism The flag of Corsica shows a man wearing a headband. In Japanese culture, hachimaki headbands may symbolise determination or devotion. Traditionally in Korea, warriors and members of military organizations such as the hwarang wore specialized headbands that kept hair firmly in place. Practically, these headbands served to clear any obstruction to the eyes so as to not hinder the soldier in combat. Emblematically, the headbands served to symbolize strength of loyalty and submission to the state. Contemporary Korean high school students, particularly male students, are often portrayed donning headbands in preparation for the rigorous college entrance examinations. Students commonly write encouraging or inspiring phrases on these headbands, such as \\"do or die!\\". This practice has been largely popularized by the media. Fashion =Materials and uses= Rafael Nadal wearing green head band during a tennis match A headband depicting the Tree of Currier House (Harvard College) There are many materials used for headbands such as wood, leather, plastic, metal, fabric, hemp, teeth, human and animal hair, bone, and novelty materials. The leather headbands are usually glued onto a harder plastic headband, or they are hand-stitched. Plastic headbands, which are most common, can be wavy, straight or angled and come in many colours. Metal can be used to form and support leather headbands. Metal-only headbands may be plain or decorated, sometimes with precious jewels. Fabric headbands are comfortable because they do not dig into the head. They usually have an elastic band, so that the headband forms to the head. Toothed headbands have comb-like teeth that are connected to the top part of the headband. Their teeth ensure that the hair stays in place. Novelty headbands can be used for holidays and may have decorations attached such as bunny ears, reindeer ears, Santa Claus hats and others. Headbands are often part of a larger fashion statement -- they can be colour-coded and matched accordingly to one's outfit. Utilitarian uses LeBron James seen wearing his signature headband Headbands, or sweatbands, are worn around the forehead during physical activity to absorb sweat and keep it from reaching the eyes. Sweatbands are often made of a continuous loop of terrycloth, as it is a particularly absorbent fabric. Folded bandanas, usually knotted behind the head, also serve this purpose. Headbands are usually used for sports but have not been popular since the late 1970s or early 1980s. LeBron James is one of the most notable players who wears a headband during basketball games. They also come in the form of wristbands. Shi'ite ritual wearing a red headband with the name \\"Ruqayyah\\" written on it Headbands are also used for protection from cold and windy weather. These headbands are sometimes called earbands, which are made from a broad strip of heavy fabric, and have a contoured shape designed to fit over the ears, forehead, and neckline. Compared to winter hats, headbands have the advantages of providing warmth to exposed skin with minimal interference with the wearer's hairdo, allowing heat buildup formed by heavy exercise to vent through the top of the head, and requiring less storage space when not being worn. This type of headband is often used by skiers snowboarders, runners, and workers who spend time in the cold weather. Headbands are also available to prevent water from entering a person's ears while swimming. These headbands are thin, made of neoprene, and fit the head very tightly. These headbands are useful for swimmers who need to protect themselves from swimmer's ear but find traditional earplugs or ear putty uncomfortable. Padded headbands are also available as protective equipment. They are used widely in soccer, and are mandatory for girls' lacrosse in Florida.

Nominated for the Locus award,The Golden Globe is set in the same continuity as Steel Beach, taking place a few years later. Plot The Golden Globe takes place in Varley‚Äôs \\"Eight Worlds\\" universe. The solar system has been colonized by human refugees fleeing aliens (known as \\"the Invaders\\"). Earth and Jupiter are off-limits to humanity, but Earth's moon and the other planets and moons of the solar system have all become populated. There are also minor colonies set in the Oort cloud beyond the solar system itself. The Golden Globe story is told initially from a first person perspective, but a substantial portion of the book comes in the form of extended flashbacks. The Golden Globe in question is Luna, Earth's moon and the most heavily inhabited world in the solar system since the Invaders obliterated human civilization on Earth. The novel begins as a first person account of Valentine's adventures in the outer worlds of the solar system as he attempts to make his way to Luna in order to play King Lear in an upcoming production. Valentine is a consummate actor and a skilled con man. It is by exercising the latter skill that he runs afoul of the Charonese Mafia, personified by the cold-blooded and nigh-unkillable assassin Isambard Comfort. The story is punctuated by several extended flashback sequences in which we learn that Valentine's father, a supremely egotistical and domineering stage actor, has groomed his son almost from birth to follow in his footsteps. It is Valentine, Sr.'s megalomania and obsession with the stage that sets the tone for much of the flashback material. While his father is auditioning for a role and has left young Kenneth sitting in a waiting room, Valentine wanders a little and gets swept up to audition for a part in a new children's adventure show called \\"Sparky and His Gang\\" and is cast in the lead role. As the show becomes increasingly popular, Valentine, Sr. interferes more and more, and becomes more difficult for his son and the producers of the show to deal with. We learn in these flashback segments that Valentine, Sr. subjects his son to monstrous and potentially fatal child abuse. This is framed quite realistically and Valentine, Sr. is apparently aware of but unable to control his nearly homicidal rage. At times, both in the main story and in flashback, Valentine meets with a mysterious character named Elwood. It is ambiguous in the narrative exactly what type of being Elwood is; however, as the novel progresses, both in the present and in flashback, the character is more fully identified as Elwood P. Dowd and said to look very much like actor James Stewart, who played a character of the same name in Harvey. Though the reader gradually comes to believe Elwood is a figment of Valentine's imagination, the climactic confrontation between Valentine and his father blurs this distinction considerably. However, Valentine narrates his own flashbacks for the reader, and as much as states that he may be an unreliable narrator. It is revealed in both the main and flashback storylines that Valentine killed (or believed himself to have killed) his father. In the main storyline, he is, after 70 years on the run, eventually put on trial for this murder, and his case is weighed by the Central Computer of Luna. Genetic tests reveal that Valentine is actually a clone of his father (further evidence of the maniacal self-absorption of the father). The fact that cloning was illegal at the time of his father's murder causes the Central Computer to declare that no crime was committed, as the only legal remedy in place at the time was for one clone or the other to be destroyed. At the conclusion of the novel, Valentine says that he has reclaimed his fortune (long inaccessible to him during his life on the run) and thrown in his lot with the Heinleiners, a reclusive group of libertarian idealists who are building a starship and planning a voyage to the stars.

The show was hosted by actor Ron Ely, with Dave Williams as announcer for the first season and John Harlan the second with Art James as a substitute. The Tommy Oliver Orchestra, with Lisa Donovan as vocalist, was also featured. Face the Music was produced and distributed by Sandy Frank Productions. The basic premise of Face the Music was a musical guessing game in the same vein as Name That Tune, which Sandy Frank was also distributing when Face the Music premiered and for whom Tommy Oliver had been the orchestra director during the mid-1970s. The twist, however, was that in addition to identifying the songs that the orchestra played, the contestants had to link the song titles to famous people, places, and things. Gameplay On each episode three new contestants compete for the right to face a returning champion in the end game. The first part of the game was played in three rounds. =Main game= Round 1 The contestants were shown six pictures, mostly faces of famous people, although places and even fictional characters were shown at times. The band played a song, and the first contestant to buzz-in, give its title, and identify the face associated with it scored 10 points. The idea was to link the title with something closely linked to the famous face, such as \\"Happy Talk\\" for talk show host Johnny Carson. In another example, an actor (such as Rob Reiner or Carroll O'Connor) who appeared on a certain television series would be linked to the theme song from that series (in this case, All in the Family). An incorrect guess carried no point penalty. However, a contestant who failed to correctly identify a song after buzzing-in was locked out of the next one. The round ended after one song had been played for each of the six famous faces. Round 2 In the second round, each song served as a clue to the identity of a subject. The subject category was given to the contestants (person, place, thing, fictional character, etc.), after which the band (or on some occasions, Donovan) played/sung the first song. A contestant buzzed-in and attempted to correctly name the song. Doing so gave the contestant the opportunity to name the subject to which the song applied. If the contestant was wrong or did not guess the subject, another song was played and the process repeated. As in round 1, if the contestant failed to identify the correct song, they would be locked out of the next tune. Up to four musical clues were played for each subject, and correctly identifying the subject earned the contestant 20 points. For example, in the category of \\"fictional character\\", the songs \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", \\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\\", \\"Go Away Little Girl\\", and \\"Band of Gold\\" all pertained to Goldilocks from \\"The Story of the Three Bears\\". The round was played until time was called, with the two highest-scoring players advancing to the third round. In the event of a tie for second place, a shortened version of the first round was played. Three pictures were shown to the tied contestants, after which a song played. The first contestant to name the song and identify the picture to which it applied advanced to round three. If all three contestants were tied, a second song was played to determine the second contestant who advanced. Round 3 In Round 3, the remaining two contestants again tried to guess subjects through use of song titles. This time, if a contestant did not correctly identify a song title the opposing player was given the chance to do so. Identifying the subject in this round was worth 30 points. The player in the lead when time was called advanced to the Championship Round to face the champion while the other player won a consolation prize for advancing to the third round. As before, a tie was broken with a shortened version of the first round. =Championship round= In the championship round, the reigning champion and the surviving contestant competed to become the first to identify a famous person. Six pictures of a celebrity were concealed onstage, ranging from childhood through maturity, and each was revealed one at a time with an accompanying musical clue. A contestant had to correctly name the tune and identify the celebrity pictured to win the game and return on the next episode. For the first picture only, after providing a correct title to the tune, a contestant was given ten seconds to ponder their guess before verbally attempting to identify the celebrity. Contestants who correctly named the celebrity won a cash prize of $10,000 (originally a prize package during the first two weeks). If neither contestant correctly named the tune or identified the celebrity, play continued with a second tune and picture, and contestants won a $5,000 prize package for correctly identifying both. The process continued with additional tunes and pictures, each reducing the potential jackpot by $1,000. The sixth and final picture was in full color. If neither contestant correctly identified both the tune and famous person after the sixth musical clue, a tiebreaker similar to the ones used in rounds two and three was played for the $1,000 prize package and to determine a champion. Any champion who won five consecutive championship rounds received a new car as a bonus prize. A ten-day champion won a trip around the world, or in later episodes, a camping trailer. In the first season, champions stayed on for up to ten games or until defeated. In the second season, champions stayed on until defeated, regardless of the number of wins. Episode status Face the Music still exists in its entirety and has been previously rerun on CBN (July 2, 1984 to September 27, 1985 and January 6 to August 29, 1986), USA Network (January 2 to September 8, 1989, and March 26 to September 14, 1990),The Intelligencer ‚Äì January 2, 1989The Intelligencer ‚Äì September 8, 1989The Intelligencer ‚Äì March 26, 1990The Intelligencer ‚Äì September 14, 1990 and The Family Channel (January 2 to September 29, 1995)The Intelligencer ‚Äì January 2, 1995The Intelligencer ‚Äì September 29, 1995 Band members Face the Music featured band members who also appeared on another show by Sandy Frank Productions, Name That Tune.

Early life Meskin was born in Brooklyn, New York to parents Max and Rose Meskin. He was a childhood fan of pulp magazines, especially The Shadow, and his interests led him to become the art editor of his high school newspaper, and later to attend the Art Students League of New York and Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, from which he graduated in 1938. Comics work After finishing school, Meskin went to work for Eisner & Iger, one of the most prominent \\"packagers\\" who supplied complete comic books to publishers testing the waters of the emerging medium. There he did pencils for Fiction House's \\"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle\\" in Jumbo Comics. In late 1939, he also worked for the packager Harry \\"A\\" Chesler, producing material for the MLJ/Archie Comics characters as Ty-Gor son of Tiger, The Press Guardian, Bob Phantom, Mr. Satan, The Shield, Wizard, and Dick Storm between 1939 and 1942. In 1941, Meskin started at National Comics, drawing stories for the characters Vigilante, Wildcat, Starman and Johnny Quick. He told comics historian and artist Jim Steranko that during this period his art style was heavily influenced by film: \\"Citizen Kane (1941) influenced us a great deal, all of us. We were very excited about it and spent quite a bit of time discussing it, employing its elements in our work. There was a contest as to who saw it the most times\\".Steranko, Jim, The Steranko History of Comics In his \\"Johnny Quick\\" superhero feature, which appeared from Sept. 1941 through Jan. 1946 in More Fun Comics, Meskin uniquely conveyed the flash-like quick moving actions of Johnny Quick by drawing close knit snapshot-like drawings one next to the other, of the hero in motion. He didn't copy DC Comics' \\"The Flash\\" or Timely Comics' \\"The Wizard\\" rendering technique of blurred windstreams following those superheroes' every move. During his time at National, Meskin also did work for Marvel Comics, Gleason and Nedor Comics, Spark, and other publishers. At Nedor he worked on the Black Terror as well as on the Fighting Yank together with Jerry Robinson. From 1944 to 1946, he and Robinson formed a studio which produced material for the short-lived publisher Spark Publications. In 1949 Meskin left National and joined the Simon & Kirby studio where he worked on a variety of titles such as Boys' Ranch and Prize Comics. He returned to National in 1956, where he created the feature \\"Mark Merlin\\" and also worked on a large number of war, science fiction and horror titles. In 1965, Meskin left the comics world and became a commercial illustrator and storyboard artist in the advertising industry, working at BBD&O; until his retirement in 1982. For the next 13 years he worked as a volunteer at St. Josephs Nursing Home in Yonkers. Awards In July 2013, during the San Diego Comic-Con, Meskin was one of six inductees into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. The award was presented by Mad magazine cartoonist and Groo the Wanderer creator Sergio Aragon√©s.

An Audichron field service engineer would then visit the telephone company and help install the Audichron equipment in the central office. The phone company would then hook up incoming trunks to the Audichron equipment and would bill the final customer (e.g., the bank) each month for the trunks and the Audichron equipment. Audichron received payments from the telephone company. Audichron hired \\"talent\\" to come into its recording studio to make recordings. Each customer could choose between a man's voice and a woman's on the announcements. During the 1950s, Mary Moore did the female voice. She was replaced, about 1965, by Jane Barbe, who specialized primarily in time and weather. Pat Fleet joined, in 1981, with customer-message recordings, coin-amount requests, and out-of-service recordings; she rarely did time and weather. John Doyle continues to be the only male voice. From the 1980s, the female voices were provided by Barbe and Fleet; they were joined by Joanne Daniels, who did number-change announcements and who was the \\"time lady\\" for most of the Western United States.\\"Time of day calling it quits at AT&T;\\", Los Angeles Times, August 29, 2007 The Audichron Company was acquired in 1989 by Electronic Tele-Communications, a manufacturer of telephone answering machines that was founded in 1949.Corporate History, Electronic Tele-Communications, Inc.

Ted departed after their debut album, Aliotta Haynes Music (1970), and was replaced by John Jeremiah. As Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah, their 1971 eponymous album was their last for the Ampex label. The band scored a popular regional hit in the Chicago, Illinois area in 1972 with the title track of their follow-up 1973 album, Lake Shore Drive, a tribute to the lakefront highway in Chicago. The initials \\"LSD\\" are occasionally used in Chicago vernacular to refer to the highway (although it is sometimes referred to as the Outer Drive to distinguish it from Inner Lake Shore Drive, which extends from Ohio St. to Hollywood Ave.). Elsewhere, LSD is better known as the initials of the name of a hallucinogenic drug.

The mixture of materials also resulted in a lighter instrument than what had been available up until that time, weighing a mere 2 kg. The early \\"Fly\\" models were highly appreciated by musicians and well received by critics.10 Guitars You Need to Know #8: Parker Guitars by Lucas Frost on Uberchord.com, September 7, 2015 (this article has errancies) The Parker company was acquired by the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003, which was itself sold to Jam Industries in August 2009. As of November 2016, the brand was inactive after the factory in Illinois was closed.  History  The first model launched by Parker was the Fly in 1993. Designed by Ken Parker and Larry Fishman, this model was unique for its use of composite materials and light weight. The guitar's combination of traditional magnetic pickups and piezo-electrics in the bridge allowed players to achieve both electric and acoustic tones. Perhaps most significant to the guitar‚Äôs design is the almost complete absence of a neck heel to permit greater ease of access to the uppermost frets.Parker Fly: Six things you didn't know by Christopher Scapelliti on Guitar World, May 14, 2018 Parker guitars were characterized as thin and ultra-lightweight instruments; they were generally made from lighter woods like poplar, basswood, and spruce, although there were maple and mahogany Fly models. They had composite materials (resin, epoxy and carbon glass skin) to reinforce a thin carved body and neck. Fingerboards were composite and use stainless steel frets. Electronics include the integrated use of coil split humbuckers, single coil and piezo pickups with active circuitry. The proprietary vibrato bridge used a unique flat steel spring which helped the guitar to maintain the pitch. The vibrato had three settings; bend down only, full floating and locked. In October 2002, Parker initiated the first production run of the Fly bass guitar, in both 4-string and 5-string versions. The 5-strings were noted for their ease of use for 4-string players, both with respect to weight and string spacing. Parker 4-string basses produced in the original factory in Wilmington, MA shipped in 2003 and had seven digit serial numbers using the same formula for dating as the original NiteFly guitars while 5-string basses were shipped first and had six digit numbers that begin with 092 reflecting the 2002 manufacturing. Basses made by U.S. Music Corporation used the same seven digit formula continuing the 4-string serial number and dating. As with other Parker guitars, they offered both magnetic and piezoelectric pickups, with the ability to blend the two. The Fly Bass was discontinued in 2008 and Parker currently offers 4 and 5 string basses with the newer MaxxFly shape. The last original Fly guitars, with the balance wheel on the face of the guitar and the four-knob layout, appeared in 2003. That same year, the Fly was \\"refined\\" with a new control layout, consisting of a master volume, a master tone (with coil-split function) and a master volume for the piezo, eliminating the separate volume control for the magnetic pickups and the piezo tone control. Numerous other changes were made as well. Several Special edition Flys were also introduced in later years. Major names in these were; the Fly Mojo Snakeskin, stock guitars covered in snakeskin; the \\"Four Seasons\\" Fly Mojos with thematically corresponding finishes; and a koa Fly Mojo released as part of the Select series. In 2010, the MaxxFly model was introduced. Based on the Fly, the MaxxFly features a modified headstock (allowing the instrument to be hung a standard guitar wall hanger), a modified top horn (more ergonomically and traditionally shaped), standardized pickup cavities, 22 frets instead of 24, and a slightly thicker, heavier body. It shares the same general construction as the standard Fly. When Parker sold his company to the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003, most of the guitars started to be manufactured outside the United States.

Then Marshall Chess, son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess, recruited the members to form a new group, Rotary Connection.

The album included strings by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and, on two tracks, sitar, to produce a unique blend soul/funk with classical undertones. The band released the album Aladdin in 1968. Three further albums failed to sell enough, so the ban broke up. Aliotta then joined his brother, Ted, and Skip Haynes to form the band Aliotta Haynes Music. Their debut album was released in 1970 and, after Ted left and John Jeremiah joined, the new group Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah released their own debut the same year. Known for the Chicago area hit Lake Shore Drive, the band stayed together through the decade, releasing two more albums. In 2015 he died of obstructive pulmonary disease.

Like most unionists, loyalists are attached to the British monarchy, support the continued existence of Northern Ireland, and oppose a united Ireland. Ulster loyalism has been described as a kind of ethnic nationalism and \\"a variation of British nationalism\\".Ignatieff, Michael. Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism. Vintage, 1994. p.184.John McGarry and Brendan O'Leary. Explaining Northern Ireland. Wiley, 1995. pp.92‚Äì93. Ulster loyalism emerged in the late 19th century, as a response to the Irish Home Rule movement, and the rise of Catholic Irish nationalism. Although most of Ireland was Catholic, in the province of Ulster, Protestants were a near-majority. Ulster was also more industrialized than other parts of Ireland and was heavily dependent on trade with Great Britain. Loyalism began as a self-determination movement among Ulster Protestants who did not want to become part of an autonomous Ireland. While some Irish Catholics were also unionist, loyalism emphasized a Protestant and British heritage. These movements led to the partition of Ireland in 1921; most of Ireland became an independent state, while about two- thirds of Ulster remained within the United Kingdom as a self-governing territory called Northern Ireland. Since partition, most loyalists have supported upholding Northern Ireland's status as a part of the United Kingdom, i.e. unionism. The terms 'unionist' and 'loyalist' are often used interchangeably. Loyalists are also described as being loyal primarily to the Protestant British monarchy rather than to the British government and institutions.Alison, Miranda. Women and Political Violence. Routledge, 2009. p.67. Garret FitzGerald argued that loyalists are loyal primarily to 'Ulster' rather than to 'the Union'.Cochrane, Fergal. Unionist Politics and the Politics of Unionism since the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Cork University Press, 2001. p.39. A small minority of loyalists have called for an independent Ulster Protestant state, believing that they cannot rely on the British government to support their cause (see Ulster nationalism). In Northern Ireland there is a tradition of loyalist Protestant marching bands. There are hundreds of such bands who hold numerous parades each year. The yearly Eleventh Night (11 July) bonfires and The Twelfth (12 July) parades are associated with loyalism. Background The term loyalist was first used in Irish politics in the 1790s to refer to Protestants who opposed Catholic Emancipation and Irish independence from Great Britain. Upon the partition of Ireland in 1921, six of the nine counties in the province of Ulster did not join the newly independent Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland) and remained a part of the United Kingdom. Academically cited records from 1926 indicate that at that stage 33.5% of the Northern Ireland population was Roman Catholic, with 62.2% belonging to the three major Protestant denominations (Presbyterian 31.3%, Church of Ireland 27%, Methodist 3.9%). Tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic population (which mostly supported a united Ireland) and its Protestant population (which mostly supported remaining part of the UK) led to a long-running bloody insurgency known as the Troubles from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. Political parties Loyalist graffiti and banner on a building in a side street off the Shankill Road, Belfast (1970) ;Active parties: * Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), which is linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commando (RHC) ; Former parties * Protestant Coalition (2013-2015) * Ulster Democratic Party (1981‚Äì2001) * Ulster Vanguard (1972‚Äì1978) * Volunteer Political Party (1974) * Ulster Protestant League (1930s) Paramilitary and vigilante groups Loyalist paramilitary and vigilante groups have been active since the early 20th century. In 1912, the Ulster Volunteers were formed to stop the British Government granting self-rule to Ireland, or to exclude Ulster from it. This led to the Home Rule Crisis, which was defused by the onset of World War I. Loyalist paramilitaries were again active in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì22), and more prominently during the Troubles (late 1960s‚Äì1998). The biggest and most active paramilitary groups existed during the Troubles, and were the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA)/Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). They, and most other loyalist paramilitaries, are classified as terrorist organizations. During the Troubles, their stated goals were to combat Irish republicanism ‚Äì particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ‚Äì and to defend Protestant loyalist areas.Doherty, Barry. Northern Ireland since c.1960. Heinemann, 2001. p15 However, the vast majority of their victims were Irish Catholic civilians, who were often killed at random in sectarian attacks. Whenever they claimed responsibility for attacks, loyalists usually claimed that those targeted were IRA members or were helping the IRA.Kentucky New Era, 14 April 1992 M. L. R. Smith wrote that \\"From the outset, the loyalist paramilitaries tended to regard all Catholics as potential rebels\\".Smith, M L R. Fighting for Ireland?. Psychology Press, 1997. p.118 Other times, attacks on Catholic civilians were claimed as \\"retaliation\\" for IRA actions, since the IRA drew most of its support from the Catholic community.Tonge, Jonathan. Northern Ireland. Polity, 2006. p.157 Such retaliation was seen as both collective punishment and an attempt to weaken the IRA's support; some loyalists argued that terrorizing the Catholic community and inflicting a high death toll on it would eventually force the IRA to end its campaign. Loyalist paramilitaries were responsible for about 30% of all deaths in the Troubles, and were responsible for about 48% of all civilian deaths. (choose \\"organization summary\\" and \\"status summary\\" as the variables) Loyalist paramilitaries killed civilians at far higher rates than both Republican paramilitaries and British security forces. The modus operandi of loyalist paramilitaries involved assassinations, mass shootings, bombings and kidnappings. They used sub machine-guns, assault rifles, pistols, grenades (including homemade grenades), incendiary bombs, booby trap bombs and car bombs. Bomb attacks were usually made without warning. However, gun attacks were more common than bombings. In January 1994, the UDA drew up a 'doomsday plan', to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. It called for ethnic cleansing and re-partition, with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant.Wood, Ian S. Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp.184‚Äì185. Some loyalist paramilitaries have had links with far-right and Neo-Nazi groups in Britain, including Combat 18,Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity. NYU Press, 2003. p.45. the British National Socialist Movement,Goodrick-Clarke, pp.40‚Äì41. and the National Front.Wood, Ian S.Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp.339‚Äì40. Since the 1990s, loyalist paramilitaries have been responsible for numerous racist attacks in loyalist areas.\\"Racist war of the loyalist street gangs\\". The Guardian, 10 January 2004. Retrieved 21 October 2012. A 2006 report revealed that 90% of racist attacks in the previous two years occurred in mainly loyalist areas.\\"Loyalists linked to 90 per cent of race crime\\". The Guardian. 22 October 2006. In the 1990s, the main loyalist paramilitaries called ceasefires. Following this, small breakaway groups continued to wage violent campaigns for a number of years, and members of loyalist groups have continued to engage in sporadic violence. Fraternities and marching bands In Northern Ireland there are a number of Protestant fraternities and marching bands who hold yearly parades. They include the Orange Order and Apprentice Boys of Derry. These fraternities, often described as the \\"Loyal Orders\\",Glossary of terms on the Northern Ireland conflict. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) have long been associated with unionism/loyalism.Tonge, Johnathan. Northern Ireland. Polity, 2006. pages 24, 171, 172, 173.

The prizes are presented to individuals in the fields of education, ideas improving world order, music composition, religion, and psychology. The religion award is presented jointly by the University of Louisville and the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Initially, the awards came with a bonus of US$150,000 each, making them among the most lucrative in their respective fields. This cash prize increased to $200,000 beginning in 2000. Beginning in 2011 the award amount dropped to $100,000 after the fund for the prize lost money due to a drop in the stock market. The first award, for Music Composition, was presented in 1985. The award for Ideas Improving World Order was added in 1988 and Education in 1989. In 1990, a fourth award, Religion, was added as a joint prize between the university and the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Psychology was added in 2000; the first award was given in 2001. In 2015 a special award, the Spirit Award, created for the award's thirtieth anniversary, was presented to former boxer Muhammad Ali. Some of the most notable winners include former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev (world order); Academy Award-winning composer Tan Dun (music composition); German theologian J√ºrgen Moltmann (religion); Aaron Beck, considered the founder of cognitive therapy (psychology); and former Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Princeton University President William G. Bowen and former Harvard University President Derek Bok (education). H. Charles Grawemeyer (1912‚Äì1993), industrialist, entrepreneur, astute investor and philanthropist, created the awards at the University of Louisville in 1984. An initial endowment of $9 million from the Grawemeyer Foundation funded the awards, which have drawn thousands of nominations from around the world. Although Grawemeyer was a chemical engineer by schooling, the University of Louisville graduate cherished the liberal arts and chose to honor powerful ideas in five fields in performing arts, the humanities, and the social sciences. Grawemeyer distinguished the awards by honoring ideas rather than lifelong or publicized personal achievement. He also insisted that the selection process for each of the five awards‚Äîthough dominated by professionals‚Äîinclude one step involving a lay committee knowledgeable in each field. As Grawemeyer saw it, great ideas should be understandable to someone with general knowledge and not be the private treasure of academics.

Biography A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Mary Alice Dwyer Dobbin is an award-winning television executive with extensive experience in creative development, production, and management. Her nickname has been \\"Mickey\\" since childhood. She was married to the late Leon Dobbin, who was a retired NBC executive. Dwyer-Dobbin is a graduate of Webster University where she studied theater and speech. She earned her master's degree in theater from The Catholic University of America (CUA). Career Her first television job was with Bob Stewart Productions, working on game shows, before joining Rankin/Bass Productions producing cartoons on the NBC and ABC Saturday-morning schedules. Next she landed a job developing daytime shows at ABC as well as working on ABC Afterschool Special programs. One of the shows she helped birth was Ryan's Hope. In 1976, she was promoted to director of children's programming and, that season, brought to air the Emmy-winning daytime special My Mom's Having a Baby, which the network subsequently broadcast in prime time. A year later, she moved to NBC as director of daytime and kids programming and was subsequently promoted to vice president, children's programming. Most notably, she was responsible for bringing the Smurfs to the network. Without her, the characters may not have ever made it to the U.S. In 1981 Dwyer-Dobbin became vice president, programming, for the cable-network startup Daytime, which merged with the Cable Health Network in 1983 to create Lifetime. There, she was in charge of The Dr. Ruth (Westheimer) Show on Lifetime - a live, call-in program that broke new ground back in 1983 when it premiered, and launched Dr. Ruth's career. Eventually she returned to ABC Daytime as head of east coast programs in 1986 and soon became executive in charge of all programming and development for the division. Dennis Swanson, to whom she reported from 1991 to 1993 said about Dwyer-Dobbin, \\"Mickey is tireless, hands-on, tough, and fun to work with. She has an energy and a creative level that were unsurpassed.\\" ABC's daytime had been slipping when he took it over, and he gave her \\"a lot of credit\\" for getting it back on track. In 1996, Dwyer-Dobbin was hired by Procter and Gamble Productions to be their head of production for their three daytime drama Guiding Light, As The World Turns and Another World, replacing veteran production head Kenneth Fitts in that capacity. (Unlike most daytime shows, which are owned either partly or wholly by their creators or the network, Procter and Gamble acted as a supplier of the show to the networks, and had a substantial say in how they were produced.) Dwyer-Dobbin remained head of the P&G; soaps for several years, and also served briefly as executive producer of Guiding Light while it sought a new executive producer. On September 6, 2005, Dwyer-Dobbin announced plans to vacate her position the following month at the end of her contract. Procter & Gamble decided not to name a successor, saying that they would leave creative decisions to their programs' executive producers, Christopher Goutman and Ellen Wheeler. Dwyer-Dobbin continued as an industry consultant and as a guest speaker for women's groups and Universities. She is retired, spends much of her time traveling around the world, and lives in a New York suburb.

He made his first appearance on 5 August 2005. Lucas was the youngest member of the Holden family. He left the Bay in 2008. Casting Actor Rhys Wakefield joined the cast when he was 16 years old. Following his departure in 2008, the producers asked Wakefield to return for a short stint. The actor said they were unable to work out the scheduling and he did not appear. Storylines Lucas arrives in Summer Bay with his father Tony (Jon Sivewright) and brother Jack (Paul O'Brien). He quickly makes friends with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze), Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) and Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans). When Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) puts on a production of \\"Rex and Summer\\" at the Surf Club, Lucas and Matilda star opposite each other as the leads and fall for each other. Their every attempt to kiss is interrupted but they finally manage to kiss during the play. Lucas and Matilda's relationship is stable until Lucas goes off the rails, trashing Jack's car in a game of Dare and then paintballing Amanda Vale (Holly Brisley). After receiving an offer on their houses from Josh West's (Daniel Collopy) Project 56 scheme, Tony and Matilda's mother Beth (Clarissa House) decide to move in together, meaning that Matilda and Lucas would be living together. Problems begin to arise in Lucas and Matilda relationship due to Lucas' developing friendship with new girl Belle which Matilda disapproved of. The two split up and Lucas went on a road of self-destruction by getting involved in vandalism in the bay. After Jack's scare tactic of having him brought to the police station for his act of vandalism in Barry Hyde home, Lucas shares his troubles with Beth saying that since she has moved into the family has made him realise how much he missed his decreased mother and by accepting Beth into a mothering role he worried he would forget about his real mom. Beth reassure Lucas that no-one will ever replace his mom and things calm down. During Lucas's vandalism day he encounters a girl called Lee and she is even caught in bed during this time causing more friction between Matilda and Lucas. Lucas reassures Matilda that nothing happened and that he slept on the floor while Lee stayed over. Things seemed to look good for Lucas and Matilda up until the fire at Jack and Martha's wedding, leaving Matilda with burn scars and feeling self-conscious over her looks. Matilda is also dealing with the stress of her missing siblings Robbie and Kit, who were involved in a plane crash, and needed Lucas' support. However at the same time Lee has returned, saying that she is pregnant with a school teacher's baby and needs Lucas' help. Taking pity on Lee, Lucas helps Lee, going along with her claim that he is the father of her baby when Tony and Sally discover she is expecting. This lie hurts Matilda deeply as she believed Lucas when he said nothing happened when Lee stayed over. This also encourages her belief that she ugly due to her scars and self-esteem issues. When Lee tries to explain Lucas' innocence, Matilda uncovers the truth and tells Tony the whole story, clearing Lucas' name. While Matilda tries to apologise she insults Lucas who accuses Matilda of being selfish and not really caring about Lee. After this Matilda's bulimia begins to develop and she ends up in hospital, not wanting any help from anyone, until Lucas tells her that the belief that she has that is nothing isn't true and that she was the best thing to ever happen to him. Matilda seeks the help she ends and goes away to a camp to resolve her issue. Before she leaves Lucas tells her he will be waiting for her when she comes back. When Matilda begins seeing Dean Silverman (Gary Brun), a guy she met at the retreat for Bulimia. Lucas warns her that Dean is not what he seems, and tries to convince her further after he sees him embracing another man, but Matilda writes it off as jealousy. Dean eventually confesses and Matilda and Lucas grow closer again and share a kiss but both admit their feelings have gone and agree to be friends. Lucas then begins seeing Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey), who has recently split from her boyfriend Drew Curtis (Bobby Morley) and loses his virginity to her. However, it does not last and Drew and Belle's reunion is exposed by Drew's ex, Lisa Duffy (Jessica McNamee), breaking Lucas' heart. Lucas refuses to forgive either of them at first but he later heads off on a writer's course and eventually forgives them when he returns following Beth's shocking death. Lucas is happy when Naomi Preston (Tiffany Preece), a girl he met on the writer's course turns up but he is shocked when he learns she will be his teacher at Summer Bay High and she is equally stunned to find Lucas is not a University Student as he told her. Naomi quickly ends things with Lucas but he refuses to give up and confides in Ric and Tony. It is soon revealed in a letter that Naomi had slept with a grieving Tony and Lucas exposes the information to a devastated Matilda and her sister Kit (Amy Mizzi). Lucas then goes on a drink binge and is hospitalised. He recovers but refuses to forgive Tony who decides to move out. Ric helps him see sense and Lucas and Tony repair their relationship. Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis) makes an enemy of Lucas when he informs Tony that Lucas took out a boat and sank it. The hostilities escalate when Geoff finds favour with Tony by joining the football team. Lucas tries out in order to impress Tony but fails when he viciously tackles Geoff, leading to more arguments. Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) asks Lucas to help Geoff's younger sister, Annie (Charlotte Best) with her studies as a tutor but when Annie disappears and is found asleep on Lucas' bed, her grandfather, Bruce (Chris Haywood) gets the wrong idea. When Bruce locks Annie in her room at the farm, Lucas rescues her and reluctantly agrees to help Geoff who has nowhere else to go. When Lisa reappears, she apologises for humiliating him over Drew and Belle's affair and she and Lucas begin seeing each other. However, Lisa's ex-boyfriend Denni Maitland (Josh Helman) refuses to let her go. Lucas rescues Lisa by stealing Ric's car keys and Denni follows in hot pursuit and tries to force them off the road, causing them to crash. Lisa dies as a result of her head injuries leaving Lucas devastated. Lucas and Denni blame each other and Lucas tries to Smother Denni with a pillow but is restrained by Tony. After a quiet Summer, Lucas prepares to pack up and leave for University. When news of Jack's death reaches him, he is unable to attend the funeral as he is overseas. Reception For his portrayal of Lucas, Wakefield was nominated for Most Popular New Male Talent at the 2006 Logie Awards. Of the character, a reporter for the Evening Chronicle said \\"Lucas is one of those teenagers who, when he sulks, looks like he's been sucking lemons for a week. The reporter added that Lucas was a \\"stroppy lad\\" and that when Tony told him to shut up, it was \\"a beautiful moment\\". In October 2007, Home and Away and the Seven Network were rapped by the ACMA for broadcasting \\"raunchy scenes\\" in G-rated episodes, following complaints from viewers. One such episode was 4358, which aired on 21 February 2007, and featured Belle and Lucas's decision to have sex. Some scenes shown saw the couple in bed together as they discussed what had happened between them. The regulator said \\"ACMA found that verbal references to sex and visual depictions of sexual behaviour contained in the episode were not brief or infrequent.

The station is branded as WCRD \\"Always Better\\". The station is operated out of the David Letterman Communication and Media Building on the Ball State University campus. History WWHI was licensed on October 15, 1950 as the radio station of Wilson Junior High School. It broadcast on 91.5 MHz with 10 watts. The power was increased in 1968 beyond the original 10 watts. In 1971, the station, including its transmitter tower, was transferred to Muncie Southside High School. Five years later, an allocation change affecting various FM stations in the Muncie area resulted in a move to 91.3. \\"WCRD\\" began its operations as a carrier current AM radio station on the Ball State campus in 1986. On March 13, 1995, WCRD programs began being broadcast on WWHI outside of school hours. In 2005, WCRD obtained the license for WWHI for one dollar from Muncie Community Schools, allowing the station to broadcast beyond their carrier circuit. In the fall of 2008, a new broadcasting antenna was installed atop the West Quad building smokestack on the Ball State campus, allowing a greater broadcasting range.http://wcrd.iweb.bsu.edu/newantenna.asp In 2015, with the antenna failing and plans to dismantle the unused smokestack, this antenna was replaced with a new one on top of the Teacher's College building. The new antenna was installed in late 2015 and powered up on February 29, 2016, one hour after the previous site was powered down.confirmed by station staff A live stream of the station is also available on WCRD's website as well as periodically on Cardinal Vision, Channel 57, on Ball State's campus. A live web camera in the WCRD studio was added Fall 2008. This allows online listeners to view the DJ and guests in the studio. The camera was turned off following website updates in 2012.

An autonomous category is a monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual.Berman, pp 34 Rigid category is a synonym for autonomous category. In a symmetric monoidal category, the existence of left duals is equivalent to the existence of right duals, categories of this kind are called (symmetric) compact closed categories.

The concepts of *-autonomous category and autonomous category are directly related, specifically, every autonomous category is *-autonomous. A *-autonomous category may be described as a linearly distributive category with (left and right) negations; such categories have two monoidal products linked with a sort of distributive law.

Accessed February 5, 2011. \\"Born in Nashua, NH, in 1932, the son of a prosperous dentist and a homemaker, Duane Ramsdell Clarridge graduated from the Peddie School.\\" and then went to the Ivy League Brown University. For graduate school he went to Columbia University's Graduate School of International Affairs and joined the CIA in 1955. He then rose through the ranks of the CIA in \\"a normal career pattern up to the late 70s\\", (as quoted in an interview he gave to CNN's Cold War Episodes program), being chief of the CIA station in Istanbul, where he maintained close contacts with the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish stay-behind anti-communist organization. He transferred to Rome before becoming chief of the Latin America division in 1981. According to The New York Times, \\"[f]rom his days running secret wars for the C.I.A. in Central America to his consulting work in the 1990s on a plan to insert Special Operations troops in Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein, Mr. Clarridge has been an unflinching cheerleader for American intervention overseas.\\" During his three-year tenure, he directed several of the CIA's more notorious operations in Latin America, including the 1984 mining of Nicaraguan harbors, an act for which the United States was convicted in a 1986 World Court case at the Hague (Nicaragua v. United States). When asked about his role in the mining, Clarridge was open about his involvement but downplayed the severity of the covert operation: \\"So we decided to go big time for the economics alright... So I was sitting at home one night, frankly having a glass of gin, and I said you know the mines has gotta be the solution. I knew we had 'em, we'd made 'em outta sewer pipe and we had the good fusing system on them and we were ready. And you know they wouldn't really hurt anybody because they just weren't that big a mine, alright? Yeah, with luck, bad luck we might hurt somebody, but pretty hard you know?\\" Clarridge was also instrumental in organizing and recruiting Contra forces to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government. Clarridge used aliases such as \\"Dewey Maroni\\" during these operations. He described the early Contra force as \\"about 500... some of them were former members of the Nicaraguan National Guard (whose leader Anastasio Somoza Debayle had been overthrown by the Sandinistas in 1979), or a lot of them were just you know peasants from the mountainous areas between Honduras and Nicaragua who had been at war with somebody, forever. And in many respects they were like a bunch of cattle rustlers. Bandits. Not bandits, they weren't robbing people but they were doing the things they do in that area.\\" But, Clarridge maintained, by the end of the conflict, the Contras numbered more than 20,000 peasants due less to the CIA's efforts than to the Sandinistas' attempts at reeducation and land redistribution. He admitted to the House Intelligence Committee staff in a secret briefing in 1984 that the Contras were routinely murdering \\"civilians and Sandinista officials in the provinces as; well as heads of cooperatives, nurses, doctors and judges\\". But he claimed that this did not violate President Reagan's executive order prohibiting assassinations because the agency defined it as just 'killing'. \\"After all, this is war‚Äîa paramilitary operation,\\" Clarridge said in conclusion.\\"CIA-assisted 'contras' murdered Sandinistas, official reportedly says\\" Knight-Ridder, October 20, 1984 In 1984 he became chief of the European Division of the CIA, where he ran a successful \\"counterterrorist\\" operation. Later, with the support of CIA director William Casey, he set up a Counterterrorist Center that operated out of Langley, Virginia. =Iran-Contra= Clarridge has said that he had no involvement in the later illegal diversion of funds to the Contras. Clarridge was indicted in November 1991 on seven counts of perjury and false statements. On Christmas Eve 1992 in the waning hours of his presidency, George H. W. Bush pardoned Clarridge before his trial could finish. At the same time, Bush pardoned five of Clarridge's associates in the Iran-Contra Affair including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, Elliott Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state for Inter-American affairs; former National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane; and former CIA employees Alan Fiers and Clair George. The final version of the Walsh Report concluded that \\"there was strong evidence that Clarridge‚Äôs testimony was false.\\" Post-CIA career Clarridge operated a \\"private spying operation ... from poolside at his home near San Diego.\\"Mazzetti, Mark (2011-01-22) Former Spy With Agenda Operates a Private C.I.A., The New York Times Colleagues said that Clarridge viewed the CIA \\"largely with contempt.\\" He has \\"likened his operation, called the Eclipse Group, to the Office of Strategic Services, the C.I.A.‚Äôs World War II precursor.\\" In November 2015, Trip Gabriel of The New York Times reported that Clarridge was a top adviser to the Ben Carson presidential campaign on terrorism and national security. Clarridge was quoted as indicating that Carson struggled to grasp foreign policy, and could not grasp ‚Äúone iota of intelligent information about the Middle East.‚Äù The Carson campaign released a statement charging the Times with taking advantage of \\"an elderly gentleman.\\" Carson subsequently replied: \\"He's not my adviser. He is not my adviser. He is a person who has come in on a couple of our sessions to offer his opinions about what was going on... To call himself my adviser would be a great stretch, and he has no idea who else I'm sitting down and talking to.\\" Clarridge died at the age of 83, a week short of his 84th birthday in Leesburg, Virginia on April 9, 2016 from complications of esophageal cancer.

The name derives from the Greek xylon (wood) and melon (tree-fruit) (referencing the woody fruit). They are native to Australia, growing in the form of tall shrubs and trees. The genus includes at least two species with the common name woody pear, Xylomelum pyriforme in the eastern states of Australia, and Xylomelum occidentale in Western Australia. Two species, Xylomelum angustifolium and Xylomelum occidentale, are endemic to Western Australia . The remaining species are found in NSW and Queensland.

Fragm. 5: 174 (1866)  Fruits The fruits of Xylomelum are in the form of woody pears. When dried, these pears split down a central division, resulting in two halves. These \\"pears\\" are thought to have evolved primarily as a defense against seed predation. However, these woody fruits also provide protection of the seeds from fire. Johnson and Briggs (1963) consider the woody seeds in Proteaceae to be a late evolutionary adaptation to fire.Johnson, L.A.S. & Briggs, B.G. 1963. Evolution in the Proteaceae, Australian Journal of Botany, 11:21-61 Distribution  A map of the recorded occurrences of Xylomelum may be found at Australia's Virtual Herbarium. Classification Banksia pyriformis (fruit & seed) from Gaertner's 'De Fructibus...' X. pyriforme flowers In 1788, Joseph Gaertner described the type species of Xylomelum as Banksia pyriformis,Gaertner, J. 1788. De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum a species whose genus was effectively reclassified when James Edward Smith, in 1798, described the genus, Xylomelum, assigning it to the natural order Proteae of Jussieu.Smith, J.E. 1798. The Characters of Twenty New Genera of Plants. Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 4: 214 Smith gave the essential characters of Xylomelum as: flower spikes with simple scales, flowers with four petals bearing four stamens, with a blunt, club-shaped stigma, with a uni-locular capsule having two seeds, the seeds being winged. In 1811, Robert Brown, in On the Proteaceae of Jussieu ,Brown,R. gave a key to the genera of Proteaceae. The key places Xylomelum in the group of Proteaceae which have dehiscent fruit, and are unilocular with two seeds, thereby grouping Anadenia, Grevillea, Hakea, Lambertia, Orites and Rhopala together. Within the group, Xylomelum is distinguished from Orites and Rhopala by having winged seeds, a thickened woody follicle with an excentric locule, and a club-shaped stigma. Engler, in 1888, divided the Proteaceae into two sub-families, Persoonioideae & Grevilloideae, placing Xylomelum in Grevilloideae, and as being like Helicia in having the flower axis at the base with four glands, but differing from it by having the inflorescence in 'ears', not in loose 'grapes', and by having seeds with wings. Within the Proteaceae, Johnson & Briggs (1975) placed Xylomelum in the subfamily Grevilleoideae and the tribe Heliciaea (together with Helicia, Triunia and Hollandaea).Johnson, L.A.S. & Briggs, B.G. 1975. On the Proteaceae-the evolution and classification, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 70(2): 83-182 However, Weston & Barker (2006), argue that within the tribe of Roupaleae, Xylomelum should be placed in the subtribe of Lambertiinae and not together with the Helicia (in the subtribe of Heliciinae, using in part, the evidence of the molecular studies of Hoot & Douglas,Hoot, S.B. and Douglas, A.W. 1998.

Current exhibits depict three major themes of California Indian life: Nature, Spirit, and Family. Native peoples lived prosperously for thousands of years in what is now California. All of the exhibits and photographs on display in the museum are presented with respect for those who went before us on this land and continue to live in California communities today. California Indian cultural items in the museum include traditional baskets (along with some of the smallest in the world), a redwood dugout canoe, ceremonial regalia, beadwork, and hunting & fishing tools‚Äîsome of which are more than twenty-four hundred years old. There is also an exhibit depicting the life of Ishi, reputedly the last survivor of the Yahi tribe, illustrating how Native culture was powerfully impacted and forever changed when outsiders arrived.

Using the force of the tool being used and gravity, bench hooks can make handsawing safer and more accurate, without needing to use a vise.  Construction  Most bench hooks have three components: a bed, a fence, and a hook. The bed is the flat part of the appliance that the workpiece is placed on top of; the fence is the part the workpiece is pushed up against; and the hook is the part that is in contact with the front edge of the bench-top (see diagram to the right). Traditionally, bench hooks were made using a single piece of wood. To complete cuts without scarring the workbench surface, the fence should be shorter than the width of base and offset from one edge. When constructing a bench hook for someone who is left-handed, the fence should be offset from the left side of the bed.  Use  In use, the bench hook is laid flat over the bench, with the hook hard up against the front edge of same. With the workpiece thus firmly held against the stop, is easy to see that no clamps or other mechanical fixing are required, the wood being held in place by the combined pressure of the tool (a saw generally) and the hand. Bench hooks are meant to be an aid commonly used with hand tools, such as the backsaw, a hand plane and, somewhat less frequently, a chisel of some kind. Although very simple to make, commercially made bench hooks have become increasingly available.

He made his Currie Cup debut for the Golden Lions in 2004, doing well enough to be voted the country's most promising player that year. That November, he made his Test debut against England at Twickenham aged 21. Though the game was lost 32‚Äì16, Habana came on as a reserve to score a try with his first touch of the ball against the then World Cup holders. The following week Habana was moved into the starting line- up, where he contributed two tries to the 45‚Äì10 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. The next week, he was selected in the same position, on the left wing, in that year's final match against Argentina in Buenos Aires. = 2005‚Äì2007 = In 2005, he moved to the Blue Bulls. Following the 2005 Super 12 season, Habana was, as expected, included in the 2005 Springboks squad. He played on the left wing in South Africa's opening match of 2005 against Uruguay, whom the Springboks defeated 134‚Äì3, with Habana scoring two tries. South Africa then hosted France for a two test series; drawing the first 30-all, and winning the second 27‚Äì13, with Habana scoring two tries in both games. In the lead-up to the 2005 Tri Nations, Habana played in two tests against Australia, the first, a loss at Telstra Stadium, and then a 33‚Äì20 win at home at Ellis Park, with Habana scoring in the second Test. Habana made his Tri Nations debut on 30 July against the Wallabies at the Bulls' home of Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. South Africa won the match 22‚Äì16. The subsequent match against the All Blacks at Newlands was also a win for South Africa. In the second match against Australia in Perth, Habana scored two tries in the 22‚Äì19 win. The All Blacks won the last match of the series, a thrilling 31‚Äì27 win for the New Zealanders at Carisbrook. Although South Africa did not win the series, Habana had established himself on the international stage, finishing as the tournament's joint highest try-scorer with New Zealands' Doug Howlett and Joe Rokocoko. In the Currie Cup, the Blue Bulls made it to the final, which was played at home at Loftus Versfeld, against the Free State Cheetahs. The Cheetahs, somewhat underdogs, won the final. In November of that year, Habana earned caps for South Africa against Argentina, Wales and France, scoring two tries in the Welsh match. Habana was named to the five-man shortlist for 2005 IRB World Player of the Year, and was also selected by SA Rugby as 2005 South Africa Player of the Year in 2005. The Springboks endured a poor year in 2006 as they lost four of their six tri nations matches. They also lost to France in the midyear test and lost to Ireland 32‚Äì15 ‚Äì a game in which Habana was averted to centre for the first time in a Springbok shirt. He scored a try. They then lost to England in the first test but gained revenge in the second test. In April 2007 Habana competed against a cheetah in a 100-meter race to help raise awareness of the imminent danger of the cheetah being classified as an endangered species, according to De Wildt officials. He lost, because cheetahs can run 70 mph, instead of 22 mph.Man Races World's Fastest Cat. CNN.com, 16 April 2007. = 2007 Super 14 = Habana's most dramatic act of the 2007 Super 14 season was his last minute try in the final, enabling flyhalf Derick Hougaard to make an easy conversion and giving the Bulls a dramatic 20‚Äì19 victory over the Sharks. The try was especially hard to take for Sharks fans as it was debated if Habana should have even been on the field after dangerously tackling fullback Percy Montgomery in the air, in the opening minutes of the game. Habana later admitted in an interview that, despite not intending to cause Montgomery harm, he should have been sent off for the challenge. = 2007 World Cup = Habana was selected on the wing for the Springboks first game of the x2007 Rugby World Cup, where he scored four tries in the 59‚Äì7 win over Samoa in Paris. In South Africa's final group game, he scored two tries against the US in Montpellier. He also scored two tries against Argentina in the semifinal, equalling Jonah Lomu's record of 8 tries in one World Cup. To score the first try, he chipped the defensive line, outran the cover defence, regathered the ball and scored near the corner flag. To score the second, he intercepted the ball after Argentina had gone blindside off a scrum, running nearly the length of the field to dot the ball down under the posts. He was a part of the world cup winning side contributing to the defeat of England in the 2007 final. Habana was awarded the IRB Player of the Year Award at the 2007 IRB Awards, held in Paris on 21 October.Habana named IRB Player of the Year. 22 October 2007. = 2008 Season = Springbok change kit The 2008 season wasn't Habana's greatest. Although he kept his spot in the Springboks side, he failed to make an impact like he did in the previous year. He only scored two tries in the whole year, one against the All Blacks in their 19‚Äì8 loss and one against England in the 42‚Äì6 win. The team struggled to adapt to new coach Peter de Villiers incoherent model for an expansive game, and thus the Springbok backline failed to find attacking impetus throughout that season. The Springboks had a poor year, only winning two of their six games in the 2008 Tri Nations but came back at the end of the year to win all of their Tour Matches against Wales, Scotland and England. = 2009 Super 14 = Habana had a mixed super 14 season. He was quiet on attack, but was a rock on defence, later he found his attacking form and finished the season second top try scorer, with 8 tries. This led to the Blue Bulls regaining their title as Champions of the Southern Hemisphere. = 2009 British and Irish Lions Tour of South Africa = Habana had targeted the Lions tour as one of the biggest moments of his career, possibly bigger than the World Cup. In a close first test the South Africans defeated the Lions 26‚Äì21, but Habana failed to show the form he had displayed in the Super 14. In the second test, the Lions were more fired up and led 19‚Äì8 with 20 minutes to go before Habana burst through their defence and scored one of his most memorable tries. The Springboks went on to win after his Bulls teammate Morn√© Steyn kicked a last gasp penalty from 53m. Habana was rested for the final test, a game which South Africa would rather forget as they lost 28‚Äì9 but with their series win they gained revenge after losing the 1997 Tour. = 2009 Tri Nations = After the Lions series came the Tri-Nations. New Zealand beat Australia in the opening game 22‚Äì16, so the pressure was on South Africa to claim a victory over the All Blacks in their opener at Bloemfontein. They did this with a 28‚Äì19 win. They played the All Blacks at Durban the following week. This was Habana's 50th test and South Africa won 31‚Äì19 with Morn√© Steyn scoring all 31 points. This was the first time they'd beaten the All Blacks in successive games at home in 33 years (South Africa won 3 out of 4 home tests against New Zealand in 1976). The next week they took on Australia in Cape Town. South Africa once again came home with a 29‚Äì17 win. This meant they'd won all of their home games in the tournament for the first time since 2005 putting them on course for their first championship win since 2004. If South Africa take the 2009 Tri-Nations title it would be Habana's first tournament win meaning he would have won every tournament in professional southern hemisphere rugby. South Africa then won their first away-game and their 4th match out of 4 in the Tri Nations with a 32‚Äì25 victory over the Wallabies at Subiaco Oval in Perth. Habana scored 2 of the 4 tries. The Springboks would take on the Wallabies in Brisbane a week later, but this time they were outmuscled 21‚Äì6. This kept New Zealand in with a chance of claiming the tournament. Habana played well, making a try-saving tackle on Lachie Turner, but came off at halftime with an injury. He was however declared fit for the visit to New Zealand as the Springboks claimed victory by 32‚Äì29, to win their first Tri Nations title since 2004. It was also Habana's first success in that tournament. Habana still had the all-time try-scoring record to beat, as he was five tries away from taking it at the end of the 2009 season. =Barbarians 2009= On 5 December, Habana played on the left wing for the Barbarians for their 'Final Challenge' against New Zealand. He scored 3 tries as the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks, who had not lost a match in the Northern hemisphere in 2 years.Habana hails his fellow Barbarian = Provincial Move = In 2009 Habana moved to Cape Town, to play for Western Province and the Stormers starting in 2010. Habana played for the Stormers in a losing Super Rugby final in 2010, a losing Currie Cup final for Western Province in 2010 and a winning Currie Cup final in 2012. =2011 Rugby World Cup= Habana was selected for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and played the first game which South Africa won against Wales 17-16 thanks to tries from Fran√ßois Steyn and Hougaard. They were then victorious against Fiji and Namibia before beating Samoa just 13-5 in which Habana scored a ninth minute try. South Africa however were then knocked out of the tournament by Australia in the quarter-finals by 11-9. =2012= Habana played two tests against England in the June internationals and 5 tests in The Rugby Championship against Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. He scored a hat trick of tries against Australia as well as tries, home and away, against the All Blacks = Toulon = Habana with Toulon, vs Stade Fran√ßais. On 11 January 2013, Habana confirmed he would move to French club Toulon at the end of the 2013 Super Rugby season, on a three-year contract. Toulon won the Heineken Cup and Top 14 in 2014 and the European Champions Cup in 2015. =2015 Rugby World Cup= Habana was selected for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where he equalled Jonah Lomu's record of 15 World Cup tries with a hat-trick against the USA. South Africa lost 20-18 in the semi-finals to eventual champions New Zealand and subsequently finished third. Habana was made vice-captain of South Africa in 2016, and brought his career try tally to 67. =Retirement= On 24 April 2018, Habana announced his retirement from all rugby at the end of his French Top 14 club Toulon's season.

He is more commonly known as E. P. Christy, and was the founder of the blackface minstrel group Christy's Minstrels. Biography He was born on November 28, 1815 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Robert F. Christy and Ruth Wheaton. Christy began his career as a minstrel in Buffalo, New York. By 1836 he was a member of the Company managed by Edwin Dean at the Eagle Street Theater in Buffalo.Buffalo Courier July 8, 1894 p. 18; Buffalo Courier July 29, 1917 He toured upstate New York from 1843 to 1845. The group took the name of its founder and became known as the Christy's Minstrels. In April 1846 Christy and his band of six performers began performing in New York City at Polmer's Opera House. The group performed at Mechanics Hall from February 15, 1847 to July 15, 1854. After performing at a benefit performance for Stephen Foster in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 25, 1847, the group specialized in performances of Foster's works. Foster sold his song, Old Folks at Home, to Christy for his exclusive use. Christy retired as a performer in 1855. He operated a chain of theaters called Christy's Opera Houses in several cities. The name of the original group, Christy's Minstrels, was licensed for use by a new organization and became synonymous with the performance tradition of blackface minstrelsy. Fearful of financial reverses due to the upheaval of the American Civil War, Christy committed suicide by throwing himself from a window in his home at 78 East Eighteenth-street in Manhattan, New York City on May 20, 1862. He died on May 21, 1862 of his injuries. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His oral last will and testament that was made while hospitalized was declared void by the surrogate court when it ruled that there were no witnesses, other than the person providing the testimony. In 1881 his widow died and her will was contested. Legacy Christy is played by Al Jolson in the Foster bio-pic Swanee River in 1939. He also wrote the lyrics to \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\".

As a result of a deal forged by Vice-President Bob Wayne of DC Comics and Publishing Director Andrew Sumner of IPC Media, it was published through DC Comics' WildStorm imprint. The series aimed to revive classic IPC-owned British comics characters such as Captain Hurricane, Robot Archie, The Steel Claw and The Spider (as well as minor characters like Fishboy and Faceache), all of whom appeared in comics published by Odhams Press and later IPC Media during the 1960s and early 1970s, such as Valiant and Lion. Debuting with a cover date of August, 2005 the first two issues were released monthly, with the third issue delayed two months (Moore & Reppion cited delays in scheduling impacting the art productionMoore & Reppion writing at Th3rdworld.com, January 22, 2006 . Accessed 4 May 2008). Initially solicited release between October 2005 and January 2006, issues 4‚Äì6 were subsequently resolicited, and finally released throughout 2006, with cover dates between June and November. The TPB collection followed swiftly after No. 6 was released in both the US and UK, from WildStorm and Titan Books respectively.ComicBookDb: Albion. Accessed 4 May 2008 Fictional setting The story revolves around a modern-day Britain where comic book characters have turned out to really exist. The British public had been largely unaware of their existence throughout the '60s and '70s, thinking them to be fictional. Most of the IPC heroes are now interred within an asylum (comparisons are drawn with Camp X-Ray), and the daughter of one of the inmates (who calls herself Penny) is determined to reveal their existence to the larger public. Using a similar narrative device to that which Alan Moore employed in Supreme and Tom Strong, flashbacks are related in the style of comics of yesteryear. For example, Penny Dreadful's childhood is drawn in a style similar to Dennis the Menace or the Bash Street Kids. Characters A number of characters from UK comics appear in Albion, some are prisoners, others prison guards, others are at large include: =Prison guards= Captain Hurricane A huge and muscular World War II hero who is the final line of defence in the government prison. He has an old-fashioned style about him; he uses quaint phrases (\\"The whole ruddy lot of us\\", \\"I could do with forty winks\\", etc.) and is casually racist. Captain Hurricane's origin is revealed in Albion, he is the result of hundreds of experiments to create a supersoldier through the use of drugs. His assistant 'Maggot' Malone is a medical doctor monitoring his condition and dosing the Captain's tea with sedatives, to prevent him from going into one of his terrifying psychotic \\"ragin' furies\\". Eagle-Eye Ian Eagleton, as a child \\"Junior Spy\\" he had many encounters with Grimly Feendish who terrified him. When he grew up, he became the Warden of the government prison that held all the heroes, villains and other bizarre individuals of his youth. Jason Hyde Jason Hyde was exposed to radiation that resulted in him developing x-ray vision and mind-reading abilities. He currently works as a security guard in the prison. Zip Nolan Once an America police detective who served in both Korea and Vietnam, he is now a member of Special Operations who is investigating potential problems in the Castle. =Prisoners= Brian's Brain A computer in the shape of a human head with a skull-like face and transparent cranium who was formerly the property of a boy named Brian Kingsley, the Brain is an \\"inmate\\" in the government prison who has become integrated with the prison computer systems and has predicted an upcoming disaster. The Cloak The Cloak was a mysterious noseless and bulgy-eyed black-caped secret agent who admired The Shadow and was a self-taught expert at sorcery. Despite his service to his country he was arrested and placed in the government prison along with all the others. Cursitor Doom Cursitor Doom is an intense-eyed, shaven-headed psychic investigator and seemingly immortal sorcerer cursed to remain forever within the walls of his isolated castle who has been in a coma for the past ‚Äútwenty-something years‚Äù, a condition which has allowed the government to convert his ancient home into a prison. The House of Dolmann Eric Dolmann is a master inventor and robotics expert, he has created a range of doll-like robots to fight crime. Over twenty years ago he was arrested by The Spider, an event that is witnessed by his daughter Penny. He died in prison. Faceache Faceache, Frederick Akeley has the ability to change or \\"scrunge\\" his face and body into a vast variety of different forms, many quite monstrous in appearance. He is a trustee in the prison and does impressions of Bruce Forsyth for the guards. He is dating Martha of the Monster Make-Up. Grimly Feendish Grimly Feendish (aka Grymleigh Gartside Fiendstien) began his life of crime over thirty years ago, committing crimes including theft, arson, murder and acts of gross indecency with the help of his monstrous little \\"Squelchies\\". He is eventually arrested and imprisoned in the government prison. Gogra Lazlo Gogra is an evil dwarf genius obsessed with possessing the towering robotic simian Mytek the Mighty. Kelly's Eye Tim Kelly rescued a South American shaman and was given a jewel called the Eye of Zoltec, also known as the Eye of Everlasting Life, which granted him invulnerability. He is currently a prisoner in the government prison, much aged after the jewel's confiscation. The Eye itself is shown to be in the possession of the British Prime Minister since the time of Margaret Thatcher. Louis Crandall Better known as the Steel Claw, a prisoner and friend of Tim Kelly. Crandall has the ability to turn invisible by directing an electrical shock through his artificial right hand, causing him to vanish completely save for the metal prosthesis itself which seems to eerily float in the air. When Crandall was arrested the Claw was confiscated and locked away in the prison armoury. Martha's Monster Make-Up Martha has make-up that her father brought home from Anvil Studios which can transform her face into that of a monster. She is in prison and is dating Faceache. Mytek the Mighty An incredibly powerful giant robot ape originally built to control unruly natives in colonial Africa which can be operated from a control room inside its head. Rubberman James Hollis, had a curse placed on him by an Indian fakir that turned his body to rubber, allowing him to stretch great distances. He attempted an escape with Tri-man which failed. He is being stored in a cooled cell which negates his elasticity. The Spider The self-proclaimed \\"King of Crooks\\", this ego and intellect-driven black-clad, pointy-eared master criminal was employed by the conservative Thatcher government to capture all super-villains and superheroes, all eccentric inventors and magicians, and all bizarre freaks and weirdos and exceptionally rebellious or gifted children who could be considered to be disruptive to the orderly running of British society, and as his reward he was also imprisoned for, as the Spider himself admits, \\"Nobody does treachery like the English\\". He loves playing mind games and is always looking for ways to escape. Tri-Man Johnny Small obtained three amazing superpowers from Professor Meek's ray: super-sight, super-speed, and super-strength. He was a prisoner until The Spider encouraged him to attempt an escape with Rubberman, and he was killed during the attempt. =Others= Bad Penny Penny Dolmann, daughter of inventor Eric Dolmann, was a child who loved to get in trouble and play with her father's robots. She was put into foster care after her father was arrested by the government and had a very difficult time in school. She has inherited her father's inventive genius, and has been locating her father's missing \\"dolls\\" since she was 18. At the start of Albion she is looking for allies to find and rescue her father and the other heroes. Charlie Peace A Victorian thief who travelled forward in time to the 1970s when he stole a magical watch from Cursitor Doom. He set up a music shop under the alias \\"Charles Love\\" and later took over an antique store. He became aware that the government was arresting unique individuals and is very careful about revealing his identity. Danny A scruffy young collector of old British comics who was apparently orphaned in a bus accident that robbed him of all memory of his previous life. After recognising Grimly Feendish and calling out his name as the master criminal is taken away by the police, he finds himself literally dragged into Penny's quest to find her father and eventually discovers how the secret of his true history is tied both to the castle and to Cursitor Doom. Janus Stark A Victorian era hero who, born with rubber- like bones, is a brilliant escapologist who can escape from any trap and uses his amazing abilities to solve crimes and fight evil. Queen of the Seas Also known as the Buoyant Queen, the Queen of the Seas is a battered and somewhat less than reliable old ship whose small crew consists of the monocled, cigarette holder-smoking Captain Enoch and his portly first mate Bert. Robot Archie Robot Archie was an old-fashioned heroic mechanical man who was deactivated and served as a display in a cafe until Penny and Danny rescued and reactivated him. Spinoffs =Albion Origins= A tie-in volume entitled Albion Origins was released by Titan Books in November 2007 in hardback, with a cover by Brian Bolland. This volume was designed to showcase the characters featured in Albion as they originally appeared in various IPC, Fleetway and other British comics. It featured reprints of several Cursitor Doom, Tim Kelly, Janus Stark and Dolmann stories, as well as newly written articles exploring the history of these characters' comics. =Thunderbolt Jaxon= Thunderbolt Jaxon, a \\"spinoff\\" of Albion ‚Äì written by Dave Gibbons and drawn by John Higgins, with covers by Gibbons ‚Äì was launched as a five issue mini-series in 2006.

The river rises on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, in the Border Ranges west of Bonalbo, near Rivertree at the junction of Koreelah Creek and Maryland River, on the watershed that marks the border between New South Wales and Queensland. The river flows generally south, south east and north east, joined by twenty-four tributaries including the Tooloom Creek and the Mann, Nymboida, Cataract, Orara, Coldstream, Timbarra, and Esk rivers. The river reaches its mouth at its confluence with the Coral Sea in the South Pacific Ocean, between Iluka and Yamba; descending over the course of its length. On its journey it passes through the towns of Tabulam and Copmanhurst, the city of Grafton, and the towns of Ulmarra, and Maclean. The river features many large river islands, including Woodford, Chatsworth, Ashby, Warregah and Harwood islands; and Susan Island Nature Reserve. The river supports a large prawn trawling and fishing industry. The Clarence River system is an extensive east coast drainage with many tributaries of differing size. Apart from the Murray River, it is the largest river in mainland Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn, though its flow for comparison is only half that of the Potomac. Its basin is, together with the very similarly-sized Hawkesbury, Australia's largest Pacific watershed south of Bundaberg. The extremely intense rainfalls that typify the North Coast mean, however, that major floods can temporarily raise the flow of the Clarence to 24 feet, as happened in 1890.  Rainfall and climate  The Bruxner Highway crossing the Clarence River at Tabulam. Grafton Bridge over the Clarence River showing Bascule span lifted to let shipping through. (Postcard from about 1932; The \\"Southern Cross\\" aeroplane has been added to the photograph.) The Clarence River, as it flows past Susan Island Nature Reserve, near Grafton. The climate of most of the basin is subtropical (K√∂ppen Cfa), though the highest areas with cooler weather are of the temperate Cfb type. Annual rainfall ranges from on the coast at Yamba down to in the shielded valley at Grafton (BOM Grafton Olympic Pool). At higher altitudes, rainfall may reach on exposed slopes but data are very poor. Most of the high areas actually receive no more rain than Grafton though variability from year to year is less. Temperatures are generally very warm, with maxima in lower area ranging from in January to in July. In the highlands, however, temperatures are much cooler and in July range from lows of around to maxima around - though in January days remain very warm at around . Rainfall per month on the coast typically ranges from around in February and March to around in September; it can average as low as between May and September inland, where exposed areas sometimes suffer bushfires after droughts, as occurred in 1915 and 2000. =Flooding= During Cyclone Oswald, the Clarence was subject to minor flooding, brought about due to the storm's residual effects and associated monsoon trough that passed over parts of Queensland and New South Wales. At Grafton, the river peaked at a new record height of . Two years earlier, the river peaked , forcing the evacuation of 3000 people from their homes. On both occasions, the city's levee was credited with preventing more severe flooding. The local historical society has published an account of newspaper reports documenting flooding of the river from the late 1800s to 2011.  Catchment land use and industry  Tourism is also a significant industry in the Clarence Valley generating around A$457million per annum and employing around 2500 people. Most of the Clarence basin is heavily forested, with important areas of remnant subtropical and temperate rainforest occurring all along the course. Only in alluvial areas where soils are less leached is there major agricultural development: in these areas the chief industries are cattle rearing and the growing of sugar cane in lower-lying areas. Of particular interest is the small island town of Harwood, where a Sperry New Holland factory and a quaint Bush Pub overlook the Clarence delta. Harwood is also the location of the local sugar mill, the Harwood Sugar Mill built in 1873 and is the oldest Australian mill still operational. The sugar mill is situated on the river due to its importance in transporting sugar cane from farms in the surrounding area in previous times. Harwood is just after the Harwood Bridge on part of Australia's National Highway from Sydney, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour to Brisbane. The freshwater reaches of the Clarence River support important populations of native freshwater fish including Eastern freshwater cod, an endangered fish species unique to the Clarence River system, and Australian bass.  Etymology  Southgate Ferry The Indigenous Bundjalung people call the river Boorimbah, while the coastal Yaygir people call it the Ngunitiji. The Aboriginal people from the Tenterfield district used the word neyand, meaning \\"top\\" as the name for the headwaters of the river. The river remained unknown to British authorities until the mid 1830s when escaped convict Richard Craig, who had been living with Aboriginals in the area, reported its existence. It was initially called the Big River, but this caused confusion as the Gwydir River in northern New South Wales was also colloquially known by this name. In November 1839 the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps, officially changed the name to the Clarence River in honour of the previous King of the British Empire, William IV, 1st Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. The local government area of the Clarence Valley Council draws its name from the river and covers the lower half of the river valley.

It is closely related to other giant predators like Carcharodontosaurus and especially Giganotosaurus as well as Mapusaurus.  Discovery and species  Known remains Vertebra and ischium Tyrannotitan chubutensis was described by Fernando E. Novas, Silvina de Valais, Pat Vickers-Rich, and Tom Rich in 2005. The fossils were found at La Juanita Farm, northeast of Paso de Indios, Chubut Province, Argentina. They are believed to have been from the Cerro Casta√±o Member, Cerro Barcino Formation (Aptian stage) around 112.2 - 121 million years ago. The holotype material was designated MPEF-PV 1156 and included partial dentaries, teeth, back vertebrae 3-8 and 11-14, proximal tail vertebrae, ribs and chevrons, a fragmentary scapulocoracoid, humerus, ulna, partial ilium, a nearly complete femur, fibula, and left metatarsal 2. Additional material (designated MPEF-PV 1157) included jugals, a right dentary, teeth, atlas vertebra, neck vertebra (?) 9, back vertebrae (?)7, 10, 13, fused sacral centra (5 total), an assortment of distal caudals, ribs, the right femur, a fragmentary left metatarsal 2, pedal phalanges 2-1, 2-2, and 3-3. The length of these animals has been estimated at up to . In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave higher estimations of . Its weight has been estimated between . Description Reconstruction of a Tyrannotitan, feeding on a Chubutisaurus. Estimated size, compared to a human. Tyrannotitan is the geologically oldest known giant carcharodontosaurid along with the more basal Acrocanthosaurus from North America (both found in Aptian-age rocks). Unlike other known carcharodontosaurids, this animal lacks skeletal pneumaticity extending into the sacral and caudal centra. The scapulocoracoid is fused, and much better developed than that of Giganotosaurus carolinii, yet the arm is very small. Most of the shaft of the scapula is missing. The acromion curves about 90 degrees from the shaft axis, making it look vaguely tyrannosaurid-like. Whether the sharp difference between taxa is due to evolution or sexual dimorphism in poorly sampled populations of both species, has not been determined (the latter seems unlikely). A proximal caudal has a very tall neural spine (about twice the height of its centrum, judging by the figure). The base of the orbital fenestra is a notch of nearly 90 degrees into the body of the jugal, which contrasts with the rounded base restored for Giganotosaurus and agrees with Carcharodontosaurus favorably. The denticles on its teeth are \\"chisel-like\\", and are virtually identical to those of other carcharodontosaurids in having a wrinkled enamel surface, heavily serrated mesial and distal carinae, and labiolingually compressed (laterally flattened) crowns. The femur of the paratype specimen is 1.40 meters long according to Novas et al. Canale et al. recover Tyrannotitan as deeply nested within the tribe Giganotosaurini as its most basal member. Characters that unite the Giganotosaurini include the presence of a postorbital process on the jugal with a wide base, and a derived femur with a weak fourth trochanter and a shallow broad extensor groove at the distal end. Classification The following cladogram after Novas et al., 2013, shows the position of Tyrannotitan within Carcharodontosauridae.

The capital of Nidzica County, it had a population in 2017 of 13,872. History Nidzica Castle The settlement was originally founded by Old Prussians who established a small fortified fortNidzica: z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic W≈Çadys≈Çaw Korzeniowski - Wydawnictwo Pojezierze 1976 page 62 and were subsequently invaded by Teutonic Knights in 1355, who then erected a small castle around 1376Nidzica: z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic W≈Çadys≈Çaw Korzeniowski - Wydawnictwo Pojezierze 1976 page 62 and implemented German Town Law in the settlement after 1381. After the victorious Battle of Grunwald (1410) the town remained in Polish hands for three months.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom VII, Warsaw, 1886, p. 31 (in Polish) It was again captured by the Poles in 1414. From 1444 Neidenburg was a member of the Prussian Confederation, at which request in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland. The Polish army then peacefully entered the town and Adam Wilkanowski became the commander in the castle.Nidzica. Z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic, Pojezierze, Olsztyn, 1976, p. 68 (in Polish) In 1455 a Teutonic attack was repulsed and the town remained within Poland for the rest of the war. The incorporation of Nidzica to Poland was confirmed in the peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466, but two years later the town came under Teutonic rule, remaining under Polish suzerainty as a fief. It then became part of the Duchy of Prussia, also a vassal state of Poland, after the secularization of the Order's Prussian territories in 1525. After 1525, Neidenburg was capital of the county, whose first administrator was Piotr Kobierzycki, a local Polish nobleman. In 1549 the Czech Brethren settled in the town. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Polish pastors from Neidenburg published their works and translations in both Neidenburg and K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec).S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom VII, Warsaw, 1886, p. 32 (in Polish)In 1656 the town was unsuccessfully besieged during the Northern Wars. The city suffered from fires in 1656, 1664, 1784 and 1804. In 16th century a significant part of inhabitants in surrounding countryside were Polish farmersNidzica: z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic W≈Çadys≈Çaw Korzeniowski - Wydawnictwo Pojezierze 1976 page 71 Neidenburg became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. Half of Neidenburg's inhabitants died from plague from 1708-1711. In 1758 the town was under Russian control. In the 18th century, a Polish school was one of the leading language schools teaching Polish in the region. Even youth from as far as Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Elbing (ElblƒÖg) and K√∂nigsberg studied here. During the Napoleonic Wars, French and Polish troops lead by general Josef Zajaczek were stationed in the town.Nidzica: z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic W≈Çadys≈Çaw Korzeniowski - Wydawnictwo Pojezierze 1976 page 81 In 1831 a cholera epidemic broke out, which killed 218 people. In 1832 Polish soldiers from failed uprising against Russia were interned in the cityNidzica.

Z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic, Pojezierze, Olsztyn, 1976, p. 86 (in Polish) The town became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. In 1874 the town's Lutheran parish had 7047 members(including rural areas) from which 4460 were Poles; the number decreased in 1885 to 3160 as Germanization in the area progressed.Nidzica. Z dziej√≥w miasta i okolic, Pojezierze, Olsztyn, 1976, p. 90(in Polish) =20th century= August 1914 in Neidenburg, a Russian aircraft shot down at the market place At the beginning of World War I in 1914, Neidenburg was heavily damaged by invading Imperial Russian troops; 167 residential and agricultural houses, 8 public and 58 business buildings were destroyed by artillery fire on 22 August 1914. The town was reconquered and rebuilt by the Germans after the Battle of Tannenberg later in August 1914. The reconstruction was originally based on plans by Bodo Ebhardt, however, his neo-gothic style was not carried out; instead, a neoclassicist style was preferred. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the East Prussian plebiscite was organized under the control of the League of Nations on 11 July 1920. The votes were 3,156 for remaining in Prussia and 17 for joining Poland. During the Kristallnacht riots in November 1938, the synagogue was destroyed and two Jewish inhabitants, Julius Naftali and Minna Zack, were killed by Nazi SA members, while several others were injured. The surviving members of the Jewish congregation were deported and killed in the Holocaust during World War II. During the war, in October 1944, the city was bombed by the Soviets. Neidenburg was the seat of a district in East Prussia until 1945; in that year the Red Army entered and occupied the town while pursuing the retreating Wehrmacht. While many, if not most, German civilians had fled the area, many of those who remained experienced atrocities at the hands of Soviet soldiers, who found themselves on German soil for the first time. Lev Kopelev, a Soviet officer and later dissident, described how he was appalled by the acts of murder and looting against those who remained. In accordance to the Potsdam Agreement, Neidenburg along with the southern part of the former province of East Prussia (including most of historic Masuria) was granted to Poland, and the remaining German population was expelled. Rather than being renamed to the traditional Polish name Nibork, the town received a new name, Nidzica. The town was significantly damaged during the war.

His works demonstrate unassuming techniques emphasizing line, color and form, similar to the work of John McLaughlin and Kenneth Noland. Kelly often employed bright colors. He lived and worked in Spencertown, New York. Childhood Kelly was born the second son of three to Allan Howe Kelly and Florence Rose Elizabeth (Githens) Kelly in Newburgh, New York, approximately 60 miles north of New York City.Goossen, E.C. Ellsworth Kelly, Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1973. His father was an insurance company executive of Scots-Irish and German descent. His mother was a former schoolteacher of Welsh and Pennsylvania German stock. His family moved from Newburgh to Oradell, New Jersey, a town of nearly 7,500 people. His family lived near the Oradell Reservoir, where his paternal grandmother introduced him to ornithology when he was eight or nine years old. There he developed his passion for form and color. John James Audubon had a particularly strong influence on Kelly's work throughout his career. Author Eugene Goossen speculated that the two- and three-color paintings (such as Three Panels: Red Yellow Blue, I 1963) for which Kelly is so well known can be traced to his bird watching and his study of the two- and three-color birds he saw so frequently at an early age. Kelly has said he was often alone as a young boy and became somewhat of a \\"loner\\". He had a slight stutter that persisted into his teenage years. Education Kelly attended public school, where art classes stressed materials and sought to develop the \\"artistic imagination\\". This curriculum was typical of the broader trend in schooling that had emerged from the Progressive education theories promulgated by the Columbia University's Teacher's College, at which the American modernist painter Arthur Wesley Dow had taught. Although his parents were reluctant to support Kelly's art training, a school teacher encouraged him to go further. As his parents would pay only for technical training, Kelly studied first at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, which he attended from 1941 until he was inducted into the Army on New Year‚Äôs Day 1943. Military Upon entering U.S military service in 1943 Kelly requested to be assigned to the 603rd Engineers Camouflage Battalion, which took many artists. He was inducted at Fort Dix, New Jersey and sent to Camp Hale, Colorado, where he trained with mountain ski troops. He had never skied before. Six to eight weeks later, he was transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland. During World War II, he served with other artists and designers in a deception unit known as The Ghost Army. The Ghost soldiers used inflatable tanks, trucks, and other elements of subterfuge to mislead the Axis forces about the direction and disposition of Allied forces. His exposure to military camouflage during the time he served became part of his basic art training. Kelly served with the unit from 1943 until the end of the European phase of the war. Postwar education Kelly used the G.I. Bill to study from 1946-47 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he took advantage of the museum's collections, and then at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While in Boston he exhibited in his first group show at the Boris Mirski Gallery and taught art classes at the Norfolk House Center in Roxbury. While in Paris Kelly established his aesthetic.Coplans, John. Ellsworth Kelly, New York: H.N. Abrams, 1972. He attended classes infrequently, but immersed himself in the rich artistic resources of the French capital. He had heard a lecture by Max Beckmann on the French artist Paul C√©zanne in 1948 and moved to Paris that year.C√©zanne and Beyond, February 26, 2009‚ÄìMay 31, 2009, Philadelphia Museum of Art website; accessed December 28, 2015. There he encountered fellow Americans John Cage and Merce Cunningham, experimenting in music and dance, respectively; the French Surrealist artist Jean Arp; and the abstract sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, whose simplification of natural forms had a lasting effect on him.Carol Vogel (January 20, 2012), \\"True to His Abstraction\\" The New York Times; accessed December 28, 2015. The experience of visiting artists such as Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, Alberto Giacometti and Georges Vantongerloo in their studios was transformative. Career After being abroad for six years Kelly's French was still poor and he had sold only one painting. In 1953 he was evicted from his studio and he returned to America the following year. He had become interested after reading a review of an Ad Reinhardt exhibit, an artist whose work he felt his work related to. Upon his return to New York, he found the art world ‚Äúvery tough.‚Äù Although Kelly is now considered an essential innovator and contributor to the American art movement, it was hard for many to find the connection between Kelly's art and the dominant stylistic trends. In May 1956 Kelly had his first New York City exhibition at Betty Parsons' gallery. His art was considered more European than was popular in New York at the time. He showed again at her gallery in the fall of 1957. Three of his pieces: Atlantic, Bar, and Painting in Three Panels, were selected for and shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art's exhibit, \\"Young America 1957\\". His pieces were considered radically different from the other twenty-nine artists‚Äô works. Painting in Three Panels, for example, was particularly noted; at the time critics questioned his creating a work from three canvases. For instance, Michael Plante has said that, more often than not, Kelly‚Äôs multiple- panel pieces were cramped because of installation restrictions, which reduced the interaction between the pieces and the architecture of the room. Kelly eventually moved away from Coenties Slip, where he had sometimes shared a studio with fellow artist and friend Agnes Martin, to the ninth floor of the high-rise studio/co-op Hotel des Artistes at 27 West 67th Street.Gwyneth Paltrow (October 13, 2011), Ellsworth Kelly profile, Interview website; accessed December 28, 2015. Kelly left New York City for Spencertown in 1970 and was joined there by his partner, photographer Jack Shear, in 1984.Karen Wright (August 2012), The Artist's Studio: Ellsworth Kelly Vanity Fair; accessed December 28, 2015. From 2001 until his death Kelly worked in a 20,000-square-feet studio in Spencertown reconfigured and extended by the architect Richard Gluckman. Kelly and Shear moved in 2005 to the residence they shared until the painter's death, a wood-clad Colonial house built around 1815. Shear serves as the director of the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation. In 2015, Kelly gifted his building design concept for a site of contemplation to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas in Austin. Titled Austin, the 2,715-square-foot stone building‚Äîwhich features colored glass windows, a totemic wood sculpture and black-and-white marble panels‚Äîis the only building Kelly designed and is his most monumental work.Blanton Museum of Art.

Observing how light dispersed on the surface of water, he painted Seine (1950), made of black and white rectangles arranged by chance. In 1951 he started a series of eight collages titled Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance I to VIII. He created it by using numbered slips of paper; each referred to a colour, one of eighteen different hues to be placed on a grid 40 inches by 40 inches. Each of the eight collages employed a different process.\\"Sixty Years at Full Intensity ‚Äì Christoph Grunenberg interviews Ellsworth Kelly\\" , tate.org.uk; accessed December 28, 2015. Ellsworth Kelly, The Meschers, 1951, oil on canvas, 59 √ó 59 inches, Museum of Modern Art. Kelly was a pioneer of hard-edge painting in the 1940s and 1950s. Kelly's discovery in 1952 of Monet's late work infused him with a new freedom of painterly expression: he began working in extremely large formats and explored the concepts of seriality and monochrome paintings.Ellsworth Kelly Fondation Beyeler; accessed December 28, 2015. As a painter he worked from then on in an exclusively abstract mode. By the late 1950s, his painting stressed shape and planar masses (often assuming non- rectilinear formats). His work of this period also provided a useful bridge from the vanguard American geometric abstraction of the 1930s and early 1940s to the minimalism and reductive art of the mid-1960s and 1970s. Kelly's relief painting Blue Tablet (1962), for example, was included in the seminal 1963 exhibition, Toward a New Abstraction, at the Jewish Museum.Ellsworth Kelly: Relief Paintings, May 12‚ÄìJune 29, 2001, Matthew Marks Gallery website; accessed December 28, 2015. During the 1960s he started working with irregularly angled canvases. Yellow Piece (1966), the artist‚Äôs first shaped canvas, represents Kelly‚Äôs pivotal break with the rectangular support and his redefinition of painting‚Äôs figure/ground relationship. With its curved corners and single, all-encompassing color, the canvas itself becomes the composition, transforming the wall behind it into the picture‚Äôs ground.Ellsworth Kelly: Singular Forms 1966‚Äì2009, April 18‚ÄìJune 8, 2013, MnuchinGallery.com; accessed December 28, 2015. In the 1970s he added curved shapes to his repertoire. Green White (1968) marks the debut appearance of the triangle in Kelly‚Äôs oeuvre, a shape that reoccurs throughout his career; the painting is composed of two distinct, shaped monochromatic canvases, which are installed on top of each other: a large-scale, inverted, green trapezoid is positioned vertically above a smaller white triangle, forming a new geometric composition.Ellsworth Kelly Green White (1968) Phillips de Pury & Company New York, Contemporary Art Part 1, May 12, 2011. After leaving New York City for Spencertown in 1970, he rented a former theater in the nearby town of Chatham, allowing to work in a studio more spacious than any he had previously occupied. After working there for a year, Kelly embarked on a series of 14 paintings that would become the Chatham Series. Each work takes the form of an inverted ell, and is made of two joined canvases, each canvas a monochrome of a different color. The works vary in proportion and palette from one to the next; careful attention was paid to the size of each panel and the color selected in order to achieve balance and contrast between the two.Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series, May 25‚ÄìSeptember 8, 2013 Museum of Modern Art, New York. A larger series of twelve works which Kelly started in 1972 and did not complete until 1983, Gray was originally conceived as an anti-war statement and is drained of color.Ellsworth Kelly: Gray 1975 ‚Äì 77, May 12‚ÄìAugust 17, 2001, Matthew Marks Gallery website; accessed December 28, 2015. In 1979 he used curves in two- colour paintings made of separate panels. In later paintings, Kelly distilled his palette and introduced new forms. In each work, he started with a rectangular canvas which he carefully painted with many coats of white paint; a shaped canvas, mostly painted black, is placed on top.Ellsworth Kelly: Reliefs 2009‚Äì2010, February 12‚ÄìApril 16, 2011, Matthew Marks Gallery website; accessed December 28, 2015. In reference to his own work Kelly said in an interview in 1996: \\"I think what we all want from art is a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living. This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you keep trying to freeze the world as if you could make it last forever. In a sense, what I've tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing.\\" Kelly commented \\"I realized I didn't want to compose pictures ‚Ä¶ I wanted to find them. I felt that my vision was choosing things out there in the world and presenting them. To me the investigation of perception was of the greatest interest. There was so much to see, and it all looked fantastic to me.\\" =Lithographs and drawings= Kelly tendered drawings of plants and flowers from the late 1940s on.Ellsworth Kelly: Plant Drawings, October 14‚ÄìNovember 28, 1992, Matthew Marks Gallery website; accessed December 28, 2015. Ailanthus (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) was the first one he did when he was in Paris.Kimberly Chou (May 25, 2012), An Abstract Master Puts on a Plant Show The Wall Street Journal; accessed December 28, 2015. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms.Ellsworth Kelly: Plant Lithographs from the Artist's Collection, December 5, 2008‚ÄìFebruary 7, 2009 Ingleby Gallery website; accessed December 28, 2015. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page.Karen Rosenberg (June 7, 2012), Loving Flowers and Vines to Abstraction The New York Times; accessed December 28, 2015. He took up printmaking in a concerted fashion in the mid-1960s, when he produced his Suite of Twenty-Seven Lithographs (1964‚Äì66) with Maeght √âditeur in Paris. It was then that he created his first group of plant lithographs. From 1970 on he collaborated primarily with Gemini G.E.L.. His initial series of 28 transfer lithographs, entitled Suite of Plant Lithographs, marked the beginning of a corpus that would grow to 72 prints and countless drawings of foliage.Plants, Flowers and Fruits: Ellsworth Kelly Lithographs: April 23, 2010, Norton Simon Museum; accessed December 28, 2015. In 1971, he completed four editions of prints and an edition of the multiple Mirrored Concorde at Gemini G.E.L. His Purple/Red/Gray/Orange (1988), at eighteen feet in length, may be the largest single-sheet lithograph ever made.Gemini G.E.L.: A Catalogue Raisonn√©, 1966‚Äì1996 ‚Äì Ellsworth Kelly National Gallery of Art website; accessed December 28, 2015. His recent editions, The River, States of the River and River II, reflect the fascination with water Kelly possessed since his early days in Paris.Ellsworth Kelly Prints Created at Gemini Gemini G.E.L., Los Angeles. In 1975, Kelly was the first artist to exhibit for the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art's MATRIX series. The exhibition displayed Kelly's Corn Stalk drawings series and two of his 1974 cor-ten steel sculptures. =Sculpture= White Curves (2002), made of white aluminium, in the garden of the Fondation Beyeler in Riehen, Switzerland Although Kelly may be better known for his paintings, he also worked at sculpture throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived one of his first wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career.Ellsworth Kelly: Wood Sculpture, September 18, 2011‚ÄìMarch 4, 2012 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.Ellsworth Kelly, Untitled (1987‚Äì1988) Christie's Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, November 14, 2012. In 1973 Kelly began regularly making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze,Ellsworth Kelly: Untitled (2005) Getty Center. often in totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can measure up to 15 feet tall, his wall reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly‚Äôs sculpture ‚Äúis founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.‚ÄùSims, Patterson and Emily Rauh Pulitzer. Ellsworth Kelly: Sculpture, New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1982. For his 1980s sculptures, during this period of his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted for the first time as much energy to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures. Untitled (2005) at Glenstone Kelly created his pieces using a succession of ideas on various forms. He might have begun with a drawing, enhanced the drawing to create a print, taken the print and created a freestanding piece, which was then made into a sculpture. His sculptures are meant to be entirely simple and can be viewed quickly, often only in one glance. The viewer observes smooth, flat surfaces that are secluded from the space that surrounds them. This sense of flatness and minimalism makes it hard to tell the difference between the foreground and background. Kelly's Blue Disc was included in the seminal 1966 exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York entitled, Primary Structures, alongside many much younger artists just beginning to work with minimal forms. =Style= William Rubin noted that ‚ÄúKelly‚Äôs development had been resolutely inner-directed: neither a reaction to Abstract Expressionism nor the outcome of a dialogue with his contemporaries.‚ÄùWilliam Rubin, ‚ÄúEllsworth Kelly: The Big Form,‚Äù Art News, vol. 62, no. 7 (November, 1963), p. 34. Many of his paintings consist of a single (usually bright) color, with some canvases being of irregular shape, sometimes called \\"shaped canvases.\\" The quality of line seen in his paintings and in the form of his shaped canvases is very subtle, and implies perfection. This is demonstrated in his piece Block Island Study (1959). =Influences= Kelly‚Äôs background in the military has been suggested as a source of the seriousness of his works. While serving time in the army, Kelly was exposed to and influenced by the camouflage with which his specific battalion worked. This taught him about the use of form and shadow, as well as the construction and deconstruction of the visible. It was fundamental to his early education as an artist. Ralph Coburn, a friend of Kelly's from Boston, introduced him to the technique of automatic drawing while visiting in Paris. Kelly embraced this technique of making an image without looking at the sheet of paper. These techniques helped Kelly in loosening his drawing style and broadened his acceptance of what he believed to be art. During his last year in Paris, Kelly was ill and also suffered depression; Sims thought that influenced his predominant use of black and white during that period. Kelly's admiration for Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are apparent in his work. He trained himself to view things in various ways and work in different mediums because of their inspiration. Piet Mondrian influenced the nonobjective forms he used in both his paintings and sculptures. Kelly was first influenced by the art and architecture of the Romanesque and Byzantine eras while he was studying in Paris. His introduction to Surrealism and Neo-Plasticism influenced his work and caused him to test the abstraction of geometric forms. =Curating= In 2014 Kelly organized a show of Matisse drawings at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum in South Hadley, Massachusetts.Carol Vogel (October 16, 2014), Ellsworth Kelly At Work The New York Times. In 2015, he curated \\"Monet/Kelly\\" at the Clark Art Institute.Holland Cotter (February 1, 2015), When an Abstract Artist Falls in Love With Monet: ‚ÄòMonet/Kelly‚Äô at Clark Art Institute, Ellsworth Kelly Falls for Monet The New York Times; accessed December 28, 2015. Personal life In 1956, he met Robert Indiana who moved in the same building and they became partners and Indiana became his mentor. They broke up around 1964. One of the reasons was Indiana's use of words in his paintings and Kelly considered such technique not worthy of high art. From 1984 until his death, Kelly lived with his husband, photographer Jack Shear, who serves as the director of the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation.Homes, A.M.,\\"With a new show at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 89-year-old artist Ellsworth Kelly shows no signs of slowing down.

In 2005, Kelly was commissioned with the only site-specific work for the Modern wing of the Art Institute of Chicago by Renzo Piano. He created White Curve, the largest wall sculpture he has ever made, which is on display since 2009.Carol Vogel (April 16, 2009), Inside Art: The Art Institute of Chicago add more works by Ellsworth Kelly The New York Times.

He later made a curtain, Spectrum VIII (2014), consisting of 12 coloured strips, for the auditorium of the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. In 1986 Kelly conceived his first free-standing building for a private collector, but it was never realized. Only in 2015, the Blanton Museum of Art acquired his design for a 2,715-square-foot stone building, including 14 black-and-white marble panels and colored glass windows, planning to build it on the museum‚Äôs grounds at the University of Texas, Austin.Robin Pogrebin (February 5, 2015), Texas Museum to Build Ellsworth Kelly Design The New York Times. The building was opened to the public February 18, 2018. A work of art and architecture, Austin, is deemed the culmination of Kelly's career. Kelly was commissioned to create a large outdoor sculpture in 1968 for the Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. The sculpture titled Yellow Blue was inspired by the Empire State Plaza setting, and is Kelly's largest standing sculpture at nine feet high and nearly sixteen feet across. Yellow Blue was his first steel sculpture and remains the only one to date in painted steel.https://ogs.ny.gov/ESP/Art.asp Nelson A.

There are many Australian geographical features named after him, including Tyers, Tyers Junction, Western Tyers, Tyers River, Mount Tyers, and Lake Tyers. His many achievements include the surveying and naming of Port Essington (1839), the determination of the border between South Australia and Victoria, naming the Baw Baw plateau, and being the first European (in 1841) to climb Mount Emu and Mount Buninyong in the Western District of Victoria. Background and early career Tyers was born in London, the son of John Tyers and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Theobald. After an education at Christ's Hospital he entered the navy in 1828. He served under Admiral Lord Lyons on the Blonde and Captain Bremer on the Alligator. He made a study of marine surveying and computed longitudes in the Channel, Mediterranean, West Indies and South Africa becoming recognised as an expert and in 1837 he was commissioned to survey the Port Essington area of northern Australia. He reached the rank of Captain, but before he was given a command he left the navy in 1839 to join the colonial service. Surveyor Following the establishment of the colony of South Australia in 1836, the region between the coast and the Murray River was rapidly being settled by squatters selecting large runs for sheep grazing. With no clear border legal oversight was impossible. An accurate border needed to be defined. In 1839 Tyers was transferred from the Royal Navy to the Colonial Service and was appointed as a government surveyor. He was instructed to ascertain the precise longitude at the mouth of the Glenelg River so that a distance to the 141st meridian (the eastern border) could be measured. On 1 October 1839 Tyers arrived in Melbourne from Sydney on the 'Pyramus'. He set about assembling his party which was to include Thomas Townsend, Assistant Surveyor, seven convicts and his private servant, also a dray, nine bullocks and two packhorses. His equipment included a theodolite, for astronomical work a sextant, a compass and circumferenter and two sets of surveying chains. He used three methods for surveying: chronometric measurements from Sydney, triangulation from Melbourne and lunar observations from Portland. He set out westwards for Portland on 13 October 1840 into what was uncharted and largely unknown territory. He crossed the Moorabool River north of Geelong near Buckley's Falls. Then proceeded to cross the Nuriwillum or Lea River. The use of aboriginal names for geographical features was a notable feature throughout his surveying career; European toponyms have superseded most of them. He then went north of Lake Corangamite and Lake Colac which he named and ascended Derrinallum or Mount Elephant twenty miles to the west on the 26th. Unable to directly go to Portland because of swampy country, he then continued northwest towards Gariwerd or the Grampians. On the 29th he ascended Dooroobdoorabul or Mount Shadwell and a day later Mount Rouse. Further thwarted by swampy land he headed north to Wiribcot or Mount Abrupt at the southern end of the Grampians which he ascended on 6 November. From here he was able to avoid difficult country by heading south and arrived at Portland on 14 November where he was accommodated and welcomed by Edward Henty. On an expanse of sandy beach he formed a broad arrow with limestone rocks. This became known as Tyers' Mark and was used to determine the starting point for the border survey. Due to primarily inadequate equipment this was later determined to be 2-mile and 4 chains (3.30 km) in error leading to the South Australia-Victoria border dispute. Commissioner for Crown Lands for Gippsland The newly appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands Tyers arrived in Gippsland in early 1844, and was soon involved in legal, moral and cultural problems of a different sort than what he found in Werten District the year before. On 11 February 1844, he notes in his diary: :\\"I issued orders to both the border police and the blacks not to fire except in self defence ‚Äì but to rush upon them and take them by surprise. When approaching the scrub however in line ‚Äì one of the party fired and was followed by the whole. The natives being taken by surprise fled though the scrub ‚Äì leaving everything behind them.\\" Some time later a boating party on the Gippsland Lakes, which included Tyers, was searching for a spot to land to gather dry sticks. A local grazier Dunderdale records: :when it [the boat] neared the land the air was filled with a stench so horrible that Mr. Tyers at once put the boat about, and went away in another direction. Next day he visited the spot with his police, and he found that the dead wood covered a large pile of corpses of the natives shot by his own black troopers, and he directed them to make it a holocaust. The worst killing during Tyers' period happened on a tributary of the Snowy River between today's Orbost and Marlo. Native Police were involved, including some Western Port blacks, traditional enemies of the Kurnai. Commissioner Tyers reported: \\"At least fifty [Aborigines] were killed by the native police and other aborigines attached to the parties in search of a white woman.\\" Policemen Dan and Walsh, under Tyers' command were reported to be culpable, a local grazier Warman in his journal records \\"as long as such persons as Messrs W. Dana and Walsh are in command of the native police nothing can be done to stop their extermination for the native blacks are the most cruel blood thirsty wretches alive, and nothing gives them so much pleasure as shooting and tomahawking the defenceless savages\\". Tyers was responsible for inaugurating government in Gippsland and virtually became 'King' of the huge isolated area, where lawlessness had been common and the Aboriginals hostile. He made a map showing holdings and their occupants and sent it to La Trobe in July 1844 with a descriptive and statistical report. He regulated the liquor trade and on his recommendations two police stations and a Court of Petty Sessions were established and two justices of the peace appointed. He improved Port Albert to cope with the growing trade with Hobart. He made extensive explorations of Gippsland, always making his land valuations after trigonometrical survey and collection of geological specimens. In 1846 he investigated the suitability of Gabo Island for a lighthouse. He was appointed a stipendiary magistrate in 1853. To this position was added that of warden of the Gippsland goldfields in 1861. He moved from Old Port to Eagle Point, where in 1849 he married Georgina Caroline, sister of William Scott, a grazier at Swan Reach. Later he moved to Sale and then built a home, Seabank, at Old Port, where he retired in 1867. He died at Melbourne on 20 September 1870.

It is located at the western end of Gulf of Tadjoura in the Tadjoura Region, touching Dikhil Region, at the top of the Great Rift Valley, some west of Djibouti city. Lake Assal is a saline lake that lies below sea level in the Afar Triangle, making it the lowest point on land in Africa and the third- lowest point on Earth after the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. No outflow occurs from the lake, and due to high evaporation, the salinity level of its waters is 10 times that of the sea, making it the third most saline body of water in the world behind Don Juan Pond and Gaet'ale Pond. Lake Assal is the world's largest salt reserve, which is exploited under four concessions awarded in 2002 at the southeast end of the lake; the major share of production (nearly 80%) is held by Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôExploitation du Lac and Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôExploitation du Salt Investment S.A de Djibouti. The lake is a protected zone under Djibouti's National Environmental Action Plan of 2000. However, the law does not define the boundary limits of the lake. Since the exploitation of the salt from the lake was uncontrolled, the Plan has emphasized the need for managing the exploitation to avoid negative impact on the lake environment. The Government of Djibouti has initiated a proposal with UNESCO to declare the Lake Assal zone and the Ardoukoba volcano as a World Heritage Site. Geography Lake Assal, with the salt pan on the left Lake Assal is located in the middle of Djibouti, in a closed depression at the northern end of the Great Rift Valley. Situated in the Danakil Desert, it is bounded by hills on the western region. The lake lies at an elevation of below sea level, making it the lowest point of Africa. The lake is characterized by two parts. The dry part of the lake, resulting from evaporation of the lake waters, is a white plain dry lake bed on the west/northwest side, which is a large expanse of salt. The second part is the highly saline water body. The watershed area of the lake is . Lake Assal's caravan route Lake Assal, in an oval shape (length and width ), consists of two distinct parts; one is \\"crystallised salt surface\\" zone of and the other is the high saline brine area of . The crystallised salt zone extends to a depth of more than whose estimated resource is about 300 million tonnes. The lake measures and has an area of liquid brine . The maximum depth is , whereas the mean depth is , which makes for a water volume of Salt extraction by the Afar nomad tribes of camel drivers and Issas from Lake Assal's salt bank established the ancient caravan routes. These linked the lake with the mountains of Ethiopia for barter trading such items as sorghum, coal, and other commodities. Salt was also bartered with South Abyssinia for items like coffee, ivory, musk, and also (historically) slaves. It was a source of wealth for the local tribes. In the recent two decades, industrial mining has been revived with development of roads linking with the Ghoubbet El Kharab bay by the Gulf of Tadjoura. The present road to Lake Assal is paved. The lake is 120 km from Djibouti city. It is also reported that the lake water level is receding as discerned from a 50-ft mark on the banks of the lake from the present water level. Climate Located in the hot desert, the lake experiences summer temperatures as high as 52 ¬∞C (126 ¬∞F) from May to September. Winter temperatures are not low at 34 ¬∞C (93 ¬∞F) from October to April with the coastal area experiencing rains. Strong, dry, hot winds are part of the environment. The monthly temperature variation is reported to be 6 ¬∞C, (10.8 ¬∞F). During the summer season, the dry hot winds blow in two directions namely, the Sabo winds from the south-west and the Khamsin winds from the north-west. Winds during October and April blow from the east, resulting in sporadic rains. Incidence of rainfall varies widely with January, April, May, and October recording rains. June to August are dry months. The mean annual rainfall in 1993 and 1997 was reported as and , respectively. The lowest rainfall of was recorded in 1996. Water temperature of the lake is reported to reach 33‚Äì34 ¬∞C. However, when the wind velocity is low and evaporation also low, the temperature recorded was found to be 20 ¬∞C for surface water and above 25 ¬∞C at shallow depths of the lake. The lake water colour also changes over the duration of the day, at times appearing in fluorescent colours. In the middle of the day, the water looks unusual with its emerald color on the background of the snow-white shore. Geology =History= Lake Assal The lake's geological history was studied by French geologists who compared it with the geology of Danakil lakes. According to this study, the lake originally contained freshwater overlying the mantle of tufas, marls and calcretes. At an elevation of \\"Melanoides tubeculatus (Melania tuberculata), Corbicula consobrina and Coelatura teretiuscula\\" were reported \\"resting on the basalts\\". At the present bed level, the formations of marls with Ervilius purpura and cerithium sp., are indicative of gradual transformation over the centuries to saline water lake; the reason could be on account of lagoon or marine intrusion. Diatomite with Navicula sp., kankar and nodules of gypsum are discerned above the saline band. These bands are converted into gypsiferous layers succeeded by rock salt layers; these layers are seen up to the lake level. =Evolution= Two interpretations have been considered for the evolution of the present highly saline lake over the rock salt layers. One view, by Degoutin, is that the lake was flooded by the sea from the Ghoubbet el Khar√¢b, and the second view is by Dreyfuss who attributes it to the rise in sea level resulting in subterranean flows that got established to the lake from the sea. Another theory mooted by the explorer Major Harris is that the volcanic convulsions could have been the cause for severing the original link of the lake with the Gulf of Tadjoura. This has been further substantiated by the level difference of between the gulf and the lake level and if this depth is added to that of the lake, the level becomes which is the level that exists at the head of the Ghoubbet el Khar√¢b. The geological setup around Lake Assal consists of volcanic basalt (3.4 ‚Äì 1.0 Mya) formations. The nearest volcano to the lake, to its southeast, is the Ardouk√¥ka, about away from the shores of the lake, which is marked on topographic map with (-) contour line. The southern part of the lake has sand patches whose width varies from about . There is hardly any arable land in the catchment. The important feature, from the point of view of the sources of water to the lake, is the Assal-Ghoubbet Rift, which is formed of recent basaltic formations (less than 1 Mya). Considering its geological evolution, the lake periphery now has crystal bands of salt and remarkable white gypsum above which are the distinct overlay of black basalt formations. Hydrology The watershed area of the lake measures . There is a residual surface runoff of fresh water into the lake from the sporadic rainfall from ephemeral streams; there are no defined streams in the catchment. Runoff from rainfall is in the form of flash floods which may last from several hours up to two or three days depending on the intensity of rainfall. This flow pattern affects the lake by inundating the salt pans. Temporary water courses are identified in the southern part of the lake, while the Kalou River valley has a permanent water source. Bay of Ghoubbet, sources of water to Lake Assal The main source of supply, however, is subsurface geothermal springs with aquifers linked to the sea water from the Ghoubbet El Kharab bay, which is to the southeast of the lake. The bay is part of the Gulf of Tadjoura, a western extension of the Gulf of Aden. The subterranean flow from the Gulf of Ghoubbet of the Red Sea is through a fissured channel of length by gravity in basalt formations of mountains existing on the east side of Lake Assal, as spring. The spring that emerges into the lake has a salt content of 39 g/L which is close to that of seawater. The lake water fluctuates by about with subsurface inflow estimated at 5,000‚Äì8,000 litres per second. The seawater-derived geothermal aquifer of the Asal-Fiale area is located in an exposed and actively extending continental rift that will become an arm of the Red Sea. In particular, Lake Assal is eligible as an experimental site to study the evolution of the deep hot brines of the Red Sea . Indeed, by observing the strontium composition of the Red Sea brines, it is easy to deduce how these salt waters found at the bottom of the Red Sea could have evolved in a similar way to Lake Assal, which ideally represents their compositional extreme . Demographics The lake precincts are inhabited by Afar people who extract salt from the lake for trading for their living. The Economic Development of Lake Assal has assessed the population of the Assal region as a whole at 20,000. Now, a settlement of 2000 people has been established near the lake. Wildlife The vegetation in the lake area consists only of scattered, low, thorny bushes or shrubs on the right bank shores, except for one lone palm tree which is bypassed by the road. The lake water is rich in minerals but the only signs of life are a rich abundance of common bacteria. The region has witnessed terrestrial fauna species of antelopes (small buck near the stream beds), camels, birds, lizards and insects. The lake area does not support any kind of aqua fauna. However, near the hot spring source to Lake Assal, some shoals of minnow fish species are reported, which are said to be similar to Cyprinodon variegatus which is a common species found in the Caribbean and South American salt works. Chemical composition Lake Assal The chemical composition of the lake water is 300 g/L NaCl which is assessed with varying potential reserves of 4 to 8 million tonnes. The hot spring, which is source of supply to Lake Assal from the gulf, has the same salinity level as that of seawater. The salinity concentration in the lake is a result of wind and sun action, which results in an annual average evaporation rate of 460 million m3. The lake water is stated to be maintaining an equilibrium. Lake Assal is the most saline body of water on earth after Don Juan Pond with 34.8% average salt concentration (up to 40% at depth); higher than the 33.7% level in the Dead Sea. The dissolved salts include NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, CaSO4 and MgBr2, with NaCl dominating in Lake Assal and MgCl2 in the Dead Sea. The surface concentration of salts is 268.8 g/L for the Dead Sea and 276.5 g/L for Lake Assal; the concentration increases to 326.6 g/L at depth in the Dead Sea and to 398 g/L at depth in Lake Assal. Salt extraction Sand pans extracted by industrial process By 1893, the French government had sold to Mr. Chefneux the right to refine and export salt from Lake Assal. Chefneux agreed to pay into the colonial office the sum of $10,000 a year, and if, during the fifty years that he was to have the exclusive right to export salt from Lake Assal, the annual product exceeded 50,000 tonnes, he was to pay a tax of 20 cents for every tonne in excess. The government also designated a part of the lake where the local people could procure all the salt they wanted without tax or hindrance. Salt production on a semi-commercial basis started in 1988 by small private enterprises. Thereafter, extraction of salt from the lake peaked in 1998-2000 when there was a conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Djibouti replaced Eritrea in supplying salt to Ethiopia at highly attractive prices (250% of the earlier sale price) when it came to be known as the \\"white gold.\\" Commercial industrial production rose between 2004 and 2008. In 2004, after an initial low of 17,745 tonnes due to import duty of 53% imposed by Ethiopian exports, production increased and recorded a high of 110,000 tonnes in 2008. However, since 2008 the production has increased manifold as a result of the Government of Djibouti Department of Industries initiating action plans, in 2002, to expand the salt extraction process from Lake Assal by adopting modern mechanical processes so that a crude salt production of 6 million tonnes could be achieved annually, eventually. After instituting a feasibility study for the purpose, the Salt Investment S.A., in a joint agreement, in March 2008, between Emerging Capital Partners LLC (ECP), Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôExploitation du Lac (SEL) and Hardtechnologies Group S.L. (\\"Hardtech\\"), have been made responsible for \\"developing the salt project further and are established under the laws of Djibouti for the purposes of harvesting, refining, storing, transporting and exporting salt extracted from Lake Assal.\\" The project envisages extraction at the rate of 1,000 tonnes per hour, supported by a 250 tonnes per hour mechanical salt washing and upgrading plant. The target of 4 million tonnes was expected to be achieved by 2012. While most commercial salt extractions are done from the huge deposits on the shores of the lake, there is also another novel way of extraction done by wading through the lake waters. The extracted salt is found in the form of spheres formed out of salt crystals and marketed in the name of Djibouti salts. The extraction process involves whole family of indigenous people wading through the lake. Men wade deep into the lake and gather the pearls in baskets. Women help in sorting the collected spheres according to size by hand. They are then dried, stored in bags and transported to the harbour for sale. =Development projects= The geothermal resources of this rift valley surrounding Lake Assal, which shows a high temperature variation, was studied for development in the Fiale area near Lava Lake, about north of Lake Assal. It is proposed to establish a geothermal power station of 30 MW capacity. Wind power potential available in the Lake Assal area is also proposed to be exploited with a Wind Power station about from Lake Assal, near the geothermal plant. Considering the seismic and volcanic activity in the lake region, exploration for mineral deposits of gold was initiated in 2001 jointly by Djibouti and an American company. Lake Assal area, the Ghoubbet El Kharab bay and the Ardoukoba Volcano are proposed to be developed as tourist attractions.

They are often made from metal or plastic and sometimes feature decorative fabric. In one type of barrette, a clasp is used to secure the barrette in place; the clasp opens when the two metal pieces at either side are pressed together. Barrettes are worn in several different ways partly according to their size, with small ones often used at the front and large ones in the back to hold more hair. They are used to keep hair out of the eyes, or to secure a bun, a French twist or a ponytail. Short metal \\"clip\\" barrettes are sometimes used to pull back front pieces of hair.

Formerly the Cop was erroneously attributed to the Danes, who were in Oxfordshire in AD 1010. Manor Adwell House Until the Norman conquest of England, a Saxon called Wulfstan held the manor of Adwell, as well as three others in the area including Britwell Salome. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Advelle had been granted to the Norman Miles Crispin, the first castellan of Wallingford Castle. As such, Adwell became part of the Honour of Wallingford. In 1300 Adwell was escheated to the Crown, and later it was made part of the Honour of Ewelme. Early in the 19th century Adwell manor was inherited by John H Birch, who took the name Newell Birch as a condition of the legacy. He left the house to his nephew Henry Birch Reynardson, in whose family the house has remained. In the 20th century three generations of Birch Reynardson served as High Sheriff of Oxfordshire: WJB Birch Reynardson in 1913, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Thomas Birch Reynardson CMG in 1958 and Bill Birch Reynardson in 1974. The manor house is Adwell House. There had been a 17th-century house on this site, but it was rebuilt in either the late 18th or early 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. Parish church Adwell's original parish church is believed to have been built late in the 12th century, although the earliest documentation of it is dated 1254. It had only a nave and chancel. The latter may have been enlarged in the 13th century, judging by its east window which was early Decorated Gothic. In the 14th century new windows were inserted in the nave and a new west door was added. In 1553 the building was recorded as having a bell-cot with two bells. All of the walls were repaired around 1800, but by the early 1860s the building was considered too weak to be restored. The old church building was demolished and in 1865 it was replaced with a new Church of England parish church of Saint Mary designed by the Gothic Revival architect Arthur Blomfield. Blomfield's design replicated the early Decorated style, but the new building retained the south doorway of the old church, which is in the transitional style between Norman and Early English Gothic. The new church also retains the memorials from inside the old one, including a stone effigy of a knight from about 1300. The new building has no aisles, but has north and south chapels arranged as transepts either side of the chancel. There is no tower, but a bell-cot with one bell. The bell dates from about 1350 and so may be from the old church building. St Mary's parish is now part of the Benefice of Thame. Amenities The Oxfordshire Way footpath passes the western edge of the village.

She has lived in London since 1964, when her family went into exile there from South Africa. She was a recipient of the Golden PEN Award. Education Slovo attended the University of Manchester, graduating in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in the history and philosophy of science, before working as a journalist and television producer. Slovo's family is Jewish. Career Slovo's novels were at first predominantly of the crime and thriller genres, including a series featuring the detective Kate Baeier, but she has since written more literary fiction. Her 2000 work Red Dust, a courtroom drama that explores the meanings and effects of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was made into a film of the same name released in 2004, directed by Tom Hooper and starring Hilary Swank, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett. Slovo's 2004 work Ice Road was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction. The novel incorporates real events (the death of Sergey Kirov) with a fictionalised rendering of life during the Siege of Leningrad. Slovo's 1997 memoir, Every Secret Thing: My Family, My Country, is an account of her childhood in South Africa and her relationship with her parents Joe Slovo and Ruth First -- both famous South African Communist Party leaders and major figures in the anti-apartheid struggle who lived perilous lives of exile, armed resistance, and occasional imprisonment, which culminated in her mother's assassination by South African forces in 1982. A family memoir in the form of a feature film, A World Apart (1988), was written by her sister Shawn Slovo and starred Barbara Hershey. With Victoria Brittain, Slovo compiled the play Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom, which was put on in theatres internationally. English PEN presidency Slovo was the 25th president of the English Centre of International PEN, the worldwide writers fellowship. In 2012 she took part in a PEN International delegation to Mexico to protest against the killing of journalists in that country, alongside presidents of other PEN Centres and internationally prominent writers.Slovo, Gillian (3 February 2012), \\"'In Mexico, Reporters are Hunted Like Rabbits'\\", Author Author, The Guardian. Personal life Slovo has one daughter, Cassie. Political views In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, Slovo signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" Awards and honours *2004 Orange Prize for Fiction shortlist for Ice Road *2013 Golden PEN Award Bibliography =Novels= *Morbid Symptoms (1984) *Death by Analysis (1986) *Death Comes Staccato (1987) *Ties of Blood (1989) *The Betrayal (1991) *Looking for Thelma (1991) *Fa√ßade (1993) *Catnap (1994) *Close Call (1995) *Red Dust (2000) *Ice Road (2004) *Black Orchids (2008) *An Honourable Man (2012) *Ten Days (2016) =Plays= *Guantanamo : Honor Bound to Defend Freedom (with Victoria Brittain) (2005) * The Riots =Biography= * Every Secret Thing: My Family, My Country (1997) * Merhaba Sinem (2014) References Further reading * External links * Contemporary Writers: Gillian Slovo * Gillian Slovo discusses Red Dust on the BBC World Book Club *Audio/Video recording of a talk by Gillian Slovo on \\"Human Rights and the Arts: Guantanamo in the Theater\\" at the University of Chicago. *Interview of Gillian Slovo by Anthony Clare on BBC Radio 4's In the Psychiatrist's Chair (originally broadcast August 1997), based in part on her biography Category:1952 births Gillian Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:South African dramatists and playwrights Category:Women dramatists and playwrights Category:South African memoirists Category:South African Jews Category:White South African people Category:People from Johannesburg Category:Presidents of the English Centre of PEN Category:South African women novelists Category:Women memoirists ","title":"Gillian Slovo"},{"id":"2625159","text":"Adwick upon Dearne is a small village and civil parish on the A6023 road near Mexborough.

Early years Kaylan was born in the Bronx to a Jewish family and grew up in Utica, New York, and Westchester, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He studied choral music and clarinet, and won a Bank of America Fine Arts Award at age 16. He graduated early (as valedictorian) from Westchester High School, and briefly attended University of California, Los Angeles on a scholarship. Music career =The Turtles= Kaylan and Mark Volman founded The Turtles, a popular band of the late 1960s. At the end of 1970, Kaylan and Volman signed on as members of Frank Zappa's band, The Mothers of Invention. The pair recorded tracks on five albums, toured to support them, and appeared in the film 200 Motels, a semi-documentary film directed by Zappa. They were compelled to use the names Flo & Eddie (\\"Flo\\" being shortened from \\"Phlorescent Leech\\") and were not allowed legal use of their own names, or that of The Turtles, until multiple lawsuits from that band were settled in 1985. In 1985 the name \\"The Turtles\\" reverted to Kaylan and Volman after fifteen years in litigation, as well as all of the master recordings they made. Thanks to Burger King, the NFL, Sony PlayStation, and countless other television advertisements and motion pictures, the Turtles' catalog remains a staple for licensing and reproduction in the twenty-first century. =Frank Zappa= Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman joined The Mothers of Invention, Frank Zappa's band, after the Turtles broke up, but were contractually prevented from using their real names, and were thus given the names \\"The Phlorescent Leech\\" (Mark Volman) and \\"Eddie\\" (Howard Kaylan). Phlorescent Leech and Eddie appeared on Frank Zappa's 1970 album Chunga's Revenge and in 1971 as lead vocalists on Zappa's Fillmore East album as Howard Kaylan/Mark Volman where they sang \\"Happy Together\\", then on Just Another Band From L.A., 200 Motels and much later Playground Psychotics and other Zappa compilations of old live concerts from 1970‚Äì71. Kaylan and Volman left The Mothers of Invention after an irate fan pushed Zappa into the orchestra pit at the Rainbow Theatre in London during a concert on December 10th, 1971, seriously injuring him.https://ultimateclassicrock.com/41-years-ago-frank-zappa-pushed-off-stage- in-london/ With Zappa confined to a wheelchair and unable to sing or play guitar for a year, The Mothers of Invention were on hiatus so Kaylan and Volman set out on their own as Flo & Eddie, never officially returning to the Mothers. =Flo and Eddie= Kaylan and Volman signed with Columbia as Flo & Eddie. In his autobiography Shell Shocked, Kaylan revealed that upon receiving the cover art for their first album, they were appalled to learn that the printer had mistakenly printed the duo's stage names in the wrong order above their photograph. Volman was identified as Flo, which had been Kaylan's stage name in Zappa's band, and Kaylan was identified as Eddie, Volman's stage name. The label refused to reprint the cover, saying that it would cost too much money. Thus, Kaylan and Volman decided to professionally swap stage names. Flo & Eddie released nine albums on Warner Bros. Records and Columbia Records in music; in film they provided music and voices for animated films like Down and Dirty Duck; and they appeared in radio broadcasting. In the 1980s, \\"Rock Steady With Flo and Eddie\\" was recorded in Kingston, Jamaica, and the partners began writing comedy and script with Chris Bearde, Larry Gelbart and Carl Gottlieb. Simultaneously, they began writing regularly featured columns for Creem, Phonograph Record Magazine and the Los Angeles Free Press. They also produced many albums for other bands and artists, as well as singing backing vocals on over 100 albums. Flo and Eddie can be heard singing with John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Ramones, Blondie, Duran Duran, The Psychedelic Furs, T.Rex, Alice Cooper and many more. =Solo work= In the mid-1990s, Kaylan turned his attention to the collecting and writing of dark fantasy literature and science fiction. He wrote two short stories, by way of experimentation, and both were published in the best-selling anthologies, \\"Phantoms of the Night\\" and \\"Forbidden Acts\\". In 2006, Kaylan released a solo album, Dust Bunnies, described as songs \\"hand-picked by Kaylan from years of seldom-heard B-sides and album cuts recorded by many of his favorite artists and supplemented by new arrangements of more familiar pieces and a rock original or two.\\" It includes covers of The Honeycombs' \\"Have I the Right?\\", Barry Ryan's \\"Eloise\\", and The Left Banke's \\"Love Songs in the Night\\" and \\"Two by Two\\". As of 2008 Kaylan penned the widely read \\"Eddie's Media Corner\\" on the official website. Media appearances He portrayed an orthodox minister who \\"married\\" Laura to Stavros in a dream sequence on General Hospital, an old hippie on Suddenly Susan, and a younger one on the It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1983, Kaylan appeared in the comedy Get Crazy, starring Malcolm McDowell and Daniel Stern. Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru type of character, leader of a caravan of time-lost, gypsy-like hippies. In 1987, Kaylan and Volman appeared in a new music video of the song \\"Happy Together\\", made to promote the romantic comedy Making Mr. Right, which featured the song during its end credits. In 2001, Kaylan wrote a treatment for a very short film about his first night on tour in London. After taking it to his friend (and Rhino Records president) Harold Bronson for input, the project was lengthened and shot as a one-hour movie. The following year, scenes were added, and it was back into the movie studio again to complete a full-length feature. My Dinner with Jimi thus became the first film written by Kaylan. It was produced by Bronson for Rhino Entertainment and directed by Bill Fishman (Tapeheads, Car 54, Where Are You?) for Fallout Films. In 2005, Kaylan appeared in a featured role in Stephen King's Riding the Bullet. Kaylan's autobiography Shell Shocked: My Life with the Turtles, Flo and Eddie, and Frank Zappa, Etc. was published by Backbeat Books in March 2013. The book was written with Jeff Tamarkin, and included a foreword by Penn Jillette and cover art by Cal Schenkel.

The Making of America collection at Cornell contains close to a million pages from more than 250 monographs and almost 1000 serials. The University of Michigan Library holds almost 13,000 volumes containing nearly four million pages of e-text.  History  The initial phase of the Making of America project began in 1995 with the development of an organized collaboration between the University of Michigan and Cornell University. The original funding for the project was in the form of grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. For the beginning phase of the project, the Antebellum Period through the Reconstruction Era, 1850-1877 was selected; the project initiators felt that the literature of this period was appropriate for the beginning phase because it was manageable in scope, of high interest to potential users and the original documents were in need to reformatting due to rapid deterioration. The two participating institutions each focused on different aspects of this period of literature based on what each already had in its collections. The University of Michigan libraries worked primarily on monographs while Cornell University focused on the journal literature of this period. Plans are underway to continue the expansion of the Making of America Project with the involvement of other major research libraries and the Digital Library Federation.  Digital Conversion and Implementation  The original print documents included in the Making of America project were scanned to create the digital copies that are included in the collection. The digital conversion process was completed by Northern Micrographic, Inc. in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The digital Making of America collection is mounted online using the Digital Library Extension System (DLXS) which was developed by the University of Michigan.  Using the Collection  The Making of America collection can be searched through both the University of Michigan Library and Cornell University Library websites. The interface provides browsing and searches of various types including basic, Boolean, bibliographic, and proximity. The Cornell University Library site specifically states that permissions are not required to use items from the Making of America project collection, but recommends a credit line to be included. The University of Michigan offers reprints of included materials and Cornell University can provide enhanced files if desired.

He is currently the lead singer of Circa Survive, Saosin, and The Sound of Animals Fighting while also maintaining a solo career. He was previously in the bands Audience of One, Jeer at Rome, High and Driving, and Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer. Green is known for his distinctive, high vocal timbre. Career =Audience of One= Anthony Green's first band formed in 1997 while he was in high school with classmate and musician Tommy Dougherty (Junction 232). The band originally had Dougherty on guitar and Green on bass and vocals. Eventually, they recruited drummer Evan Madden. Green wanted to name the band 'Saosin', but Dougherty and Madden decided against it. Before settling on the \\"Audience of One\\" name, they played a few shows under the name \\"Handsome Pete\\" in 1998 and one show under the name \\"The Bill Bixby Experience\\". Due to problems with Evan's availability to practice and play shows, they sought out a new drummer. Green and Dougherty switched bass and guitar duties. Green met drummer J.D. Foster (Makeshift/Yellow 5) at Days Away's first show in summer of 1998. Foster tried out and musically they clicked right away. The band recorded an LP entitled, I Remember When This All Meant Something at Skylight Studio in the summer of 1999. It was released on Break Even Records on December 3, 1999. During the summer of 2000, Greg Itzen (Days Away/Like Lions) was welcomed into the band as a second guitar player. As a four-piece, they recorded a four-song demo EP at Skylight Studio. That fall, two of the members went off to college and one enlisted in the military. Audience of One was deemed 'on hiatus'. =Jeer at Rome= From April 12‚Äì13, 2000, a four-song demo EP for a hardcore/metal project called \\"Jeer at Rome\\" was recorded at Skylight Studio. The band was composed of Anthony Green (vocals), Steve Mensick (guitar), Mike Lepone (guitar), Chris Mensick (bass) and Luke Carmen (drums) The self-titled demo was released on compact disc. They played a handful of shows during the spring and summer of 2000, but apparently dissolved soon afterward. =Zolof The Rock and Roll Destroyer= Anthony sang on six songs on Zolof The Rock & Roll Destroyer's self-titled first album. The recordings took place mostly in 2000 and 2001 and were released in early 2002. At that time, the band consisted of Rachel Minton (vocals and keyboards), Anthony Green (vocals and backup vocals), Vince Ratti (guitar and keyboards), Bob Bonocore (vocals and bass) and Rick Delello (drums). Green and Zolof parted ways in early 2002 due to Green's need to \\"work some things out\\" in his personal life. They still remain good friends. One year later, Ratti and Minton helped Anthony record vocals over the Saosin instrumental demo recordings, then known as 'The Gift'. Two years later, Green contributed vocals to the Zolof The Rock & Roll Destroyer song \\"This Was All A Bad Idea\\" off of their album The Popsicle EP [2004]. In 2012, Ratti mixed Circa Survive's fourth album, \\"Violent Waves\\". Minton also contributed backup vocals to the song 'Suitcase'. =High and Driving= Green recorded a four-song EP in 2002 at Ratti's Skylight Studio in Fairless Hills, PA. Green recorded most of the instruments himself except for drums and some keyboard parts. Tim Arnold (Days Away/Good Old War) supplied the drums and Ratti and Minton tracked some of the keyboard parts. The recording was shared on the internet since early 2004 and ended up being officially released on the deluxe version of Avalon on August 5, 2008 on Photo Finish Records. =Saosin= The original lineup of Saosin consisted of Anthony Green (vocals), Beau Burchell (guitar), Justin Shekoski (guitar), Zach Kennedy (bass) and Pat Magrath (drums). Their first album, an EP, consisting of 5 songs, was recorded in February and March 2003. Magrath was a studio musician hired to play drums on the album. The drum parts were written largely by Burchell with Alex Rodriguez in mind. Rodriguez was to assume the role of drummer, but he had obligations playing drums for the band Open Hand at the time. Chris Warner filled in on drums during early rehearsals. Kennedy quit the band due to personal reasons. Chris Sorenson took the spot as bassist. Before they began playing shows, Danny King replaced Warner as drummer. After only a handful of shows, Rodriguez finally took over as Saosin's permanent drummer. The band released the EP Translating the Name on June 17, 2003. It was an immediate underground success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites. Preorders of the album came with a bonus CD containing two acoustic versions of songs from the EP. Translating The Name (2003) has sold an estimated 62,000 copies as of 2008. Green quit Saosin in mid-February 2004. It was announced on February 20, 2014 that Anthony Green would be reuniting with his former band Saosin for the Skate and Surf festival on May 17, 2014. More shows were quickly booked for May, June and September totaling eight reunion shows during 2014. Anthony Green has hinted at the possibility of recording new material with Saosin after the most of the tour cycle for Circa Survive's fifth album, Descensus has completed. Saosin has announced that they will be playing some shows in California and Texas in January 2015. The band released a new single \\"Silver String\\" on March 16, 2016 while on tour. Shortly after the release of \\"Silver String\\", it was announced that Green decided to ultimately stay with Saosin, while still maintaining his role as lead vocals for Circa Survive and as a solo artist. The band released their first LP since 2009, \\"Along the Shadow\\" in May 2016 through Epitaph Records. It peaked at #45 on the Billboard 100 chart. =The Sound of Animals Fighting= Green was (from between 2004‚Äì2008) part of another side project with members of Finch, Rx Bandits, Days Away and Chiodos under the alias of The Skunk (each member of The Sound of Animals Fighting was equipped with an animal mask to hide their personas and give the band creative inspiration). Three studio albums were recorded during their time together, Tiger and the Duke (2004), Lover, the Lord Has Left Us... (2006) and The Ocean and the Sun (2008). They played four shows in August 2006 of which one was recorded for a live DVD entitled, We Must Become the Change We Want to See (2007). In March 2014, they reunited for a seven show tour, and in Feb/March 2019 for an eight show tour, playing songs from all three albums. =Circa Survive= Immediately after quitting Saosin, Green and Colin Frangicetto (This Day Forward) founded Philadelphia-based Circa Survive, which signed with Equal Vision Records. This new project changed his musical vision from post-hardcore to a more experimental rock sound. Very early on Brendan Ekstrom (This Day Forward) was recruited on guitar. By the end of summer 2004, the lineup was solidified with Nick Beard (Taken) on bass and Stephen Clifford (Reflux) on drums. Within a year, they had released a limited edition tour EP, The Inuit Sessions, and a full-length album, Juturna. They released their second album, On Letting Go, in May 2007. They parted ways with Equal Vision in August 2008. Their third album, Blue Sky Noise, was released in April 2010 on Atlantic Records. In November 2010, they released an EP called Appendage also on Atlantic Records. Their self-produced fourth album, Violent Waves, was released on August 28, 2012. Their fifth album, Descensus was released on November 24, 2014 on Sumerian Records. Their sixth album, The Amulet, was released on September 22, 2017. Anthony Green (studio albums/B-sides/remixes) =Avalon (2008)= Green announced his plans to record his first solo album in December 2007. Avalon was recorded at The Big House in Avalon, New Jersey between late February and early March 2008. Keith Goodwin, Dan Schwartz and Tim Arnold of the band Good Old War played various instruments on the album. Two music videos were shot before the album was released. \\"Dear Child (I've Been Dying To Reach You)\\" was shot on May 31, 2008 and released on July 23, 2008. \\"She Loves Me So\\" was shot in late July 2008 and released on December 15, 2008. Avalon was released on August 5, 2008, peaking at #44 on the Billboard 200 in the United States.[ Billboard], Allmusic Anthony named the album after being inspired by his father. \\"my dad said you should call it avalon-\\" =Jackie Haenn (2008)= On November 12, 2008, Green released a two-song EP entitled, Jackie Haenn to help fund his cousin-in-law's medical transport fees after she was injured in a car accident on Halloween Night. The songs are B-sides recorded during the Avalon recording session. =Avalon [Remixes] (2008)= While Green was on the Avalon tour with three-fifths of Circa Survive, Colin Frangicetto worked on his remixes of Avalon in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He used instrumentation and vocals from the original Avalon recording session but also recorded many new instruments and parts himself. He kept most of the song structures intact but the additional tracking makes it more of a 'reimagining' than a strict 'remix'. The remix album was released digitally on December 5, 2008. It was released as part of a preorder bundle for Avalon's first vinyl pressing. The physical compact disc of the remix album wasn't available until around January 20, 2009 when the vinyl bundles shipped. =Beautiful Things (2012)= Green announced the title of his second solo album as Beautiful Things in September 2009 while he and the rest of Circa Survive were in Toronto, Canada recording Blue Sky Noise. The album was mainly recorded in early January 2011 at The Big House in Avalon, New Jersey by producer Jason Cupp. Once again the members of Good Old War served as his backup band and helped shape the feel of the songs much more than for Avalon. The album title comes from the lyrics of a Good Old War song entitled \\"Lullaby\\" that Green adopted as his own. Anthony's version of \\"Lullaby\\" became the closing track of the album. The album was mixed at least seven times over the course of 2011. Green announced the release date on November 15, 2011. Beautiful Things was released on January 17, 2012, peaking at #27 on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States. A music video for the song \\"Get Yours While You Can\\" was shot in late November 2011 and released on January 31, 2012. This album also included many of his friends and idols such as Dave Davison of Maps and Atlases, Nate Ruess of Fun, Chino Moreno of Deftones, and Ida Maria to add some variety to his music. Anthony Green describes \\"Beautiful Things as, \\"The whole album is sort of about people and the victories you have with them. When I decided on the title, I wasn't thinking of a concrete thing.\\" =Young Legs (2013)= In the spring of 2011, before his second solo album was even complete, Green mentioned his desire to record and release a third solo album entitled 'Young Legs'. From May to June 2013, Green recorded 'Young Legs' at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Will Yip acted as producer, engineer, composer and performer. The band Good Old War once again joined him as his backing band, as well as, having a hand in the song's composition. On September 17, 2013, Green revealed the album's cover art, track list, release date, fall tour dates and released the first single entitled \\"Breaker\\". On October 22, 2013, the second single which is also the title track, \\"Young Legs\\" was released. The album was released on November 12, 2013, peaking at #67 on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States. 'Young Legs' contains eleven songs and the deluxe version of the album contains five demos. A music video for the song \\"Young Legs\\" was shot during the Beautiful Things tour in 2012 and was released on November 26, 2013. =Pixie Queen (2016)= In mid-late 2015, Green announced that a fourth solo album was in the works and should be ready sometime in 2016. It was announced that the album would be released on September 9, 2016 and would be titled \\"Pixie Queen\\".

Its taxonomic position is complicated, sometimes treated as a race of common snipe. The Andean population is now usually considered a distinct species, known as the puna snipe. This small snipe breeds in most of South America away from the Pacific coast and eastern Brazil, and also the Falkland Islands, Trinidad and possibly Tobago The nominate lowland race G. p. paraguaiae is resident, but southern G. p. magellanicae migrates north in winter, abandoning Tierra del Fuego altogether. The breeding habitat is wet grassy savannah for the northern form, peat bogs for magellanicae, and boggy rivers for andina. The nest is a well-hidden depression on the ground. Both parents incubate the two buff eggs for about 19 days to hatching, the precocial young leaving the nest soon after hatching. The adult South American snipe is 27‚Äì29 cm in length and weighs 110 g. It has short greenish-grey legs and a very long straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. There is a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. The wings are pointed. In northern South America, it is difficult to distinguish in the field from wintering common snipe, although they can be separated in the hand. G. p. magellanicae, which breeds southwards from central Argentina and central Chile is longer-winged, warmer and more buff in colour than the northern race. South American snipes forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, also plant material. The male performs a \\"winnowing\\" display during courtship, flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a distinctive sound. The call is a rasping tssk.

Novkoviƒá composed more than 2,500 songs and sold approximately 20 million records.https://shop.crorec.hr/crorec.hr/izvodjac.php?OBJECT_ID=210852 He is also known as the father of popular Croatian singer Boris Novkoviƒá. Biography Novkoviƒá was born to a Serbian violinist Vuka≈°in Novkoviƒá and a Croatian mother during World War II in the village of Vladimirci on the German-occupied territory of what only a few years earlier used to be Kingdom of Yugoslavia's Drina Banovina. He moved to Sarajevo at an early age, so his musical talent was discovered very early, and he joined the musical school in Sarajevo at the age of 6. After graduating conducting from Musical Academy in Sarajevo, he founded a band Pro Arte during the fall of 1967. In 1968, ƒêorƒëe's wife Ozana gave birth to their son Boris, and the family moved to Zagreb. Boris later became a rock singer-songwriter, but he split abruptly with his father at the age of 19. ƒêorƒëe's first hit came in 1969 with the song \\"Vi≈°e se neƒáe vratiti\\" performed by Mi≈°o Kovaƒç and sold in half a million copies, and a later version in 1985 had similar success. In 1973, Pro Arte merged with another Sarajevo pop group Indexi, but the experiment lasted only several months. Pro Arte existed in continuity until 1980, as well as off-and-on throughout the 1980s. In 1989 Novkoviƒá moved to live in Rovinj, Croatia. After Pro Arte, ƒêorƒëe Novkoviƒá switched to writing songs, creating material for some of the hits of the former Yugoslavia. He collaborated with performers such as Mi≈°o Kovaƒç, Neda Ukraden, Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, Tomislav Ivƒçiƒá, Tereza Kesovija, Ivica ≈†erfezi, Gabi Novak, Srebrna krila, ≈Ωanamari Laliƒá and others. After Tito's death he composed the music for the song \\"Dru≈æe Tito mi ti se kunemo\\", which was then performed by Zdravko ƒåoliƒá which was then sold in 350,000 copies. Novkoviƒá composed music for the famous thank-you schlager \\"Danke Deutschland\\" produced in January 1992 by Croatian state television as a show of gratitude to Germany for their role in international recognition of their independence. In 1993 he wrote the song \\"Don't Ever Cry\\" for Put, the first Croatian representative in the Eurovision Song Contest. Since 1997, he co- owned and managed the Croatia Records label, together with Miroslav ≈†koro. In 2000, he moved to Zagreb again. In 2003 Novkoviƒá gained a lot of popularity as judge of Story Supernova Music Talents, a reality show for aspiring musicians similar to Popstars aired on Nova TV. Death He died suddenly at the age of 63, from an apparent stroke, in Zagreb. In a Roman Catholic funeral ceremony he was buried in Zagreb's Mirogoj Cemetery.

It breeds in the Andes of northern Peru to northwestern Argentina and northern Chile. It is sometimes considered conspecific with the South American snipe. Description This 30‚Äì32 cm long snipe has a stocky body and relatively short legs for a wader. Its upperparts, head and neck are streaked and patterned with warm brown and buff, and the gold edges to the feathers form lines down its back. It shows pale to whitish underwings when in flight. The belly is white with brown barring. The horn-colored bill is long, straight and fairly robust. The legs and feet are yellow. The sexes are similar, and immatures differ only in showing pale fringes on the wing coverts. Subspecies There are two subspecies of the puna snipe: *G. a. andina, (Taczanowski, 1875), Peru to northwest Argentina *G. a. innotata, (Hellmayr, 1932), northern Chile Behaviour Little is known of its behaviour, but it has an aerial display, which involves flying high in circles, followed by a dive during which the bird makes a drumming sound, caused by vibrations of its modified outer tail feathers. The puna snipe forages by pushing its long bill deep into the mud seeking insects and worms. Its cryptic plumage provides effective camouflage when the bird stands motionless amongst marsh vegetation.

Setting View of the Desaguadero River along the cald√©n-speckled espin√°l between Mendoza and San Luis provinces. The Semi-arid Pampas cover an area of , including western Buenos Aires Province, southern Cordoba and San Luis Provinces and most of La Pampa Province. The area is, in all, home to no more than a million people, who generally enjoy some of the nation's lowest poverty rates. The Humid Pampas grassland lies to the east, while the drier Argentine Espin√°l (thorny) grassland lies to the west. The soil tends to be sandier in this region than to the east, though both regions are characterized by their mostly minimal incline and frequent finger lakes. Generally more similar than not, these two biomes are mostly distinguished by their contrasting rainfall quantities, soil quality and land use; this section of the pampas typically sees about a third less rainfall (700 mm, 27 in) than the humid pampas. Flora Path in La Pampa Province, lined with cald√©n. Not unlike the more humid pampas to the east, this area is characterized by its extensive grasslands. This groundcover, however, tends to be closer to long-grass varieties found in the world's steppes. Its landscape punctuated by relatively few trees (mostly imported omb√∫es, alders and Italian cypresses planted to provide wind breaks or landscaping), the region is home to intermittent shrublands, therein particularly carquejilla and cald√©n (prized for their medicinal qualities), as well as the shady algarrobo, common to much of Argentina. Fauna Darwin's rheas, known locally as the √±and√∫. In part owing to its sparse landscape and unreliable rains, the area's fauna rather resembles much of neighboring Patagonia's. Perhaps the most common natural inhabitant to the region is the √±and√∫, or, Darwin's rhea. Nearly ubiquitous to the region in the early 19th century, vast herds were often observed at the time and, indeed, they and their eggs had for centuries provided the Puelches and the area's other indigenous peoples with much of their protein needs. Targeted during successive genocidal campaigns between 1830 and 1880, however, these inhabitants lost most √±and√∫s to massacres by Argentine armies, who believed that in so doing, the indigenous tribes could be starved into surrender.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. Nearing extinction by the 1920s, the √±and√∫ herds have recovered substantially and have since then, like the likewise then-nearly extinct pampas deer, been protected by law. Other common fowl include gray hawks, partridges, martins, coots and storks. The region is also home to pumas, pampas foxes, cavias, maras and other drought-resistant mammals, as well as some also common to North America, like skunks and opossums. Human use The arrival of British-financed railways to the region in the 1880s brought with it the area's first significant presence of white settlers, some of whom had served in the regiments involved in the Conquest of the Desert and were granted vast tracts of land. Much of the area was subsequently fenced into cattle and sheep ranches, which dominate the region's land use to the present day; area ranchers raise approximately four million cattle (a tenth of Argentina's). Since the 1940s, advances in agriculture and crop breeding have allowed for intensive wheat, sunflower, oats and alfalfa cultivation, as well.Environmental Study of La Pampa Province Conservation and threats Though many of the hydroelectric projects put into place since then have encouraged the development of a scattering of prosperous urban areas like Santa Rosa, La Pampa, some have had unintended consequences to the area's ecological balance. Dams along the Atuel River, for instance, are often allowed to release the rainy season's excess water with little regard to the area around rural Algarrobo del Aguila, La Pampa, causing avoidable inconvenience and disruption of nearby wetlands.http://www.alihuen.org.ar/los- medios-hablan-de-nosotros-./politica-hidrica-de-la-pampa-imprevision-y-falta- de-planifica.html The former Roca-Luro Estate, now part of Parque Luro Natural Preserve, La Pampa Province. Until recently, the region was the only one in Argentina lacking a national park or natural preserve. In 1971, descendants of La Pampa Province landowners Arminda Roca and Pedro Luro deeded 7,600 hectares (29 mi2) to the provincial government, which opened the park to the public five years later. Though the area would not be designated as fully protected until 1996, this was the first significant move to protect the biome. Today the Luro Park Natural Preserve is the most visited such area in the dry pampas region. In 1977, a 9,900 hectare (38 mi2) parcel in La Pampa Province's southern dry grasslands were set aside as Lihu√© Calel National Park.http://www.argentour.com/en/national_park/lihue_calel.php These accomplishments notwithstanding, the area's ecosystem has been under increasing pressure by grazing and irrigation activities, apart from population and economic growth themselves.

A nearly identical, albeit manual focus version, called the Nikon F-301 (N2000 in North America) was also available. Subsequent models in the consumer line included the Nikon F-401, Nikon F-601, and Nikon F-801 / F-801s. Features The F-501 is a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera with automatic film loading and advance, almost a first for Nikon (the F-301 was their first SLR to feature this). The built-in motor drive provides single (one exposure and frame advance per shutter button press) or continuous (shutter will fire and film will advance so long as the shutter button is depressed) modes. Maximum film advance speed is 2.5 frames per second (frame/s) on continuous mode, but can be as slow as 1.4 frames/s depending on the status of the focus/exposure locks. Rewind is accomplished manually by a familiar rewind knob which doubled as a release for the back. The F-501 is powered by four AAA batteries housed in the bottom of the camera body, although it can utilize AA sized batteries with an optional attachment (MB-3). The F-501 uses a through-the-lens (TTL) \\"passive\\" phase- detection autofocus method for establishing focus. Unlike active systems, which set approximate focus based on distance to the subject, the \\"passive\\" system uses a CCD to \\"see\\" the focus subject and focus in a manner similar to a human operator. This method is more precise than the active method, but requires more light to function. The F-501 has two focus modes available, single, in which focus is established and does not change so long as the operator holds down lightly on the shutter button, and continuous, in which the lens continuously re-focuses on whatever is in the focus area. The F-501 can be set for auto exposure, \\"hi-speed\\" auto exposure, \\"dual\\" auto-exposure (with AI-S type lenses) which switches between regular auto exposure and hi- speed autoexposure based on the lens attached, aperture priority, or full manual exposure modes, which allow the user to set both the aperture and shutter speeds. The shutter speed and auto-exposure modes are set by the use of a dial on the top of the camera, while the aperture ring on the lens is used for aperture control. The \\"hi-speed\\" auto-exposure tends to favor higher shutter speeds and wider aperture settings than the \\"normal\\" auto exposure mode, while the \\"dual\\" mode offers \\"normal\\" auto-exposure with lenses at focal lengths less than 135 mm and \\"hi-speed\\" auto-exposure if a lens is longer than 135 mm. The F-501 supports TTL flash exposures with a wide range of Nikon flashes. The Nikon SB-20 flash was especially designed for this camera. Compatibility Like all Nikon SLRs, the F-501 accepts Nikon's F-mount lenses, but will only autofocus with lenses designated \\"AF.\\" Likewise, fully automatic exposure will only work with AI-S type lenses, including many autofocus lenses (G-type lenses are not supported by the F-501). In both cases, the camera will function with lenses without these abilities, but will not autofocus or may not have full auto exposure capabilities. AF lenses designated \\"D\\" add no functionality to the F-501, and \\"AF-S\\" and \\"VR\\" lenses will not perform their special functions if attached to an F-501. Continuing Nikon's practice at time, the F-501 has interchangeable focusing screens, a feature that is now quite unusual. Three screens (types B, E and J) were available for the F-501. Breaking from practice, though, Nikon removed the ISO-type cable release socket. Remote control functionality is still available, however, through the three-pin terminal on the camera's front with the Remote Cord MC-12 and the like. ISO cable releases can be accepted by the Terminal Release MR-3, which also doubles as a second shutter button. Design In design terms, the F-501 took a different look from previous Nikon cameras. The introduction of a polycarbonate-clad body rather than metal, which caused the camera to be black instead of silver, was the most immediate and obvious change. Also new to this model is the addition of an extended grip on the shutter button side of the camera body, a feature which has grown in subsequent autofocus SLR camera designs ever since. Nikon adopted some design concepts from the F501 in the company's first professional autofocus SLR, the Nikon F4, in 1988. Less obvious is the addition of a red stripe on the right hand front side of the camera. The stripe first appeared in the Nikon F3 in 1980, and some variation of it has been a design feature of every Nikon autofocus camera since, but on the F-501 the stripe is horizontal rather than vertical for the first time.

The Doctor of Music degree (D.Mus., D.M., Mus.D. or occasionally Mus.Doc.) is a higher doctorate awarded on the basis of a substantial portfolio of compositions and/or scholarly publications on music. Like other higher doctorates, it is granted by universities in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries. Most universities restrict candidature to their own graduates or staff, which is a reversal of the practice in former times, when (unlike higher degrees in other faculties) candidates for the degree were not required to be a Master of Arts. The Doctor of Music degree should not be confused with the Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) degree, which is the standard (Ph.D.-level) doctorate in fields such as performance (including conducting) and musical composition. (However, at least one graduate program, at Indiana University, has been issuing the D.Mus. degree since 1953 for a curriculum that would otherwise lead to the D.M.A. degree.)Correspondence with Graduate Music Office, Indiana University Bloomington. The D.Mus. is also distinct from the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in music, which is awarded in areas such as music history, music theory, and musicology. The Doctor of Music degree has also been awarded honoris causa when presented to musicians and composers such as Joseph Haydn, Richard Strauss, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Felix Mendelssohn, Simon Rattle in classical music, and Joan Baez, Matthew Bellamy, David Bowie, Phil Collins, Bruce Dickinson, Celine Dion, Irene Dunne, Bob Dylan, Kenny Garrett, Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, David Gilmour, Milt Hinton, Billy Joel, Nik Kershaw, Sir Elton John, B.B.

Career Smith, a left-handed pitcher, played collegiately at Indiana State University. He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 3rd round of the 1982 amateur draft and made his Major League debut on September 10, 1984 for Atlanta. His first successful season was 1987 with the Braves, when he led the team with 15 wins, nearly twice as many as any other Braves pitcher on a team with only 69 wins. He was among the league leaders in wins (tied 5th), innings pitched (5th), games started (tied 1st), complete games (4th) and shutouts (tied 3rd). Smith was traded from Atlanta to the Montreal Expos on July 2, 1989 for Sergio Valdez, Nate Minchey and minor leaguer Kevin Dean. Just over a year later, on August 8, 1990, Smith was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Scott Ruskin, Willie Greene and Mois√©s Alou. The trade allowed the Pirates to hold off the New York Mets down the stretch and win the National League Eastern Division pennant. Smith contributed by winning 6 games, 3 of them complete games, 2 of those shutouts, while losing only 2, and compiling a 1.30 ERA. It was during this season that Smith had his best performance, a 1 hit complete game shutout of the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader sweep that gave the Pirates a 2.5 game lead over the Mets. Smith played with the Pirates through the 1994 season before signing as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox on April 18, 1995. Smith did not have much success during the 1995 season for Boston, compiling a 5.61 ERA and an 8‚Äì8 record in 24 starts. The next offseason, he returned to the Pirates for a salary that was significantly reduced from the $3.125 million he earned in 1994. Smith pitched his final career game for the Pirates on July 5, 1996; he would be released by the Pirates the following day. Highlights On May 1, 1986 Smith struck out 12 Mets to end New York's club record tying 11 game win streak. On April 17, 1988 Smith got Atlanta's first victory of the season, ending a 10-game season-opening losing streak that set an MLB record. On October 3, 1995 Smith gave up a walk-off home run to Tony Pe√±a to end Game 1 of the 1995 American League Division Series. On June 7, 1996 Smith recorded the 100th and final win of his career, a complete game shutout at San Diego. Smith is tied with Greg Maddux for the single season Maddux record with three and has the second most career Madduxes with 7. Personal Smith has 3 daughters and lives near Atlanta. Zane enjoys listening to hard-rock music.

Career Roebuck co-founded Sears, Roebuck and Company with Richard Warren Sears in 1891. In 1895, Roebuck asked Sears to buy him out for about $20,000. At Richard Sears' request, Roebuck took charge of a division that handled watches, jewelry, optical goods, and, later, phonographs, magic lanterns and motion picture machines. His business interests did not end with Sears. He later organized and financed two companies: a manufacturer and a distributor of motion picture machines and accessories. Roebuck also served as president (1909‚Äì1924) of Emerson Typewriter Company, where he invented the improved typewriter, called the \\"Woodstock.\\" After several years in semi- retirement in Florida, the financial losses he suffered in the stock market crash of 1929 forced Roebuck to return to Chicago. By 1933, Roebuck had rejoined Sears, Roebuck and Co., where he largely devoted his time to compiling a history of the company he helped found. In September 1934, a Sears store manager asked Roebuck to make a public appearance at his store. After an enthusiastic public turnout, Roebuck went on tour, appearing at retail stores across the country for the next several years. Personal life and death Roebuck married first wife Kittie Rice 2 September 1890, in York, Ontario, Canada, and had a son Theodore Roebuck born 2 July 1891. Roebuck later married Sarah Blanche Lett.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed July 16, 2013 The creek flows into Lake Tahoe south of Tahoe City, California, and has undergone extensive restoration to reduce sediment and surface run-off to maintain the purity of Lake Tahoe. History Ward Creek and Ward Peak are named for homesteader Ward Rush, whose claim was made on April 1, 1874. In the early 1980s the McClatchy family donated lands on the south side of the creek to California State Parks. Watershed Ward Creek, the fourth largest stream (by area and discharge) of the 63 Tahoe Basin watersheds contributes 6% of the stream runoff flowing into Lake Tahoe. The creek was a major source of sediment related to erosion from subdivisions and logging roads in the watershed. The Ward Creek watershed drains an area of and has a North Fork beginning on the south slope of Ward Peak and a South Fork originating on the north side of Twin Peaks. The Ward Creek watershed is just north of the Blackwood Creek watershed, and just south of Alpine Meadows Ski Resort which is on the north side of Ward Peak and Scott Peak. The creek mainstem is paralleled by Ward Creek Boulevard/Road. Ecology From 2006 to 2013 Ward Creek Park was restored by California State Parks, the California Tahoe Conservancy and other partners to reduce erosion which deposites sediment in Lake Tahoe, removal of fire-prone crowded trees and removal of a diversion dam. Beaver dams on Ward Creek reduce sediment and nutrient (such as phosphorus) loads that would otherwise flow to Lake Tahoe. Recent evidence has shown that beaver (Castor canadensis) are native to the Sierra Nevada. Their dams do not appear to pose barriers to trout passage. Recreation Ward Creek Park is a California State Park whose is bordered by Ward Creek on the north and Highway 89 on the east. The area along the creek is protected by the California State Parks system. The Park has an extensive trail system that ties in with the bike path along Highway 89 and connects with USFS trails to Stanford Rock (which lies midway between Twin Peaks and the mouth of Ward Creek) and the Tahoe Rim Trail.

The Cape Mendocino Light was lit on December 1, 1868, standing on eight prefabricated panels sent up from San Francisco. An automated light stood near the original location but was removed in 2013. Geology Regional Seismicity 1985‚Äì2003The Cape Mendocino region of California's north coast is one of the most seismically active regions in the contiguous United States. Three earthquakes with epicenters nearby at the town of Petrolia and offshore west of Cape Mendocino, 25‚Äì26 April 1992, were outstanding, one reaching 7.2 Mw; shaking the town so badly, fires broke out and burned down historic buildings, including the 100-year old General Store and the original Post Office. Even the fire station suffered so much shifting from the quakes, fire crews had a difficult time extinguishing the fires. The quakes demonstrated that the Cascadia subduction zone is both capable of producing large earthquakes and generating tsunamis. Many geologists and seismologists believe that the main shock in the 1992 sequence may be a forerunner of a much more powerful earthquake in the Pacific Northwest. Offshore of Cape Mendocino lies the Mendocino Triple Junction, a geologic triple junction where three tectonic plates come together. The San Andreas Fault, a transform boundary, runs south from the junction, separating the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. To the north lies the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Gorda Plate is being subducted under the margin of the North American plate. Running west from the triple junction is the Mendocino Fault, the transform boundary between the Gorda Plate and the Pacific Plate. Cape Mendocino California is part of the Cascadia subduction zone.

Denali is one of the main attractions, and there are easy-to-reach lookout points for visitors driving through. Sometimes, though, it is hard to view the peak due to clouds and other weather issues. Denali, however, is not the only peak one can view, and its surrounding range is not the only place for exploration. The Talkeetna Mountains to the east also offer different levels of climbing and backpacking experiences. Divided by a large valley, there are many different views of Alaska looking in either direction. A hiker on Kesugi Ridge, looking across the valley toward DenaliThe tundra on the surrounding plateau of the ranges and in the park offer a unique environment for plants and animals. This terrain also offers many small lakes which are easy to hike to and visit. Following regularly used trails will allow visitors to view many of the park's natural beauties during their trip. Rivers in the area allow for clearwater canoeing and rapids for various levels of canoers and kayakers. This area is also known for its salmon fishing during season. Since the environment is still very rugged and uninhabited it is left virtually wild, and using proper camping and environmental practices keeps the park clean for the next visitor to see it as wild as it should be. Different seasons strike the area. During summer, there are almost 21 hours of constant daylight every day, with the sun barely dropping behind the horizon. The summer temperature is in the 80s and lower, making for nice conditions to view many attractions. During winter, the sun stays hidden most of the day and can get down to -40 degrees Fahrenheit, with snow covering most of the land. During all of the seasons the surrounding glaciers in the area can be visited, and their distinct runoff paths can be seen. =State Recreation Sites= In addition to the main park, the area also hosts two small, minimally developed State Recreation Sites founded in 1994,the Blair Lake State Recreation Site.Petersville Road Region, page 50, Alaska Department of Natural Resources and the Tokositna River State Recreation SitePlan Purpose, Denali State Park, Alaska Department of Natural Resources Wildlife The flora and fauna in the park comprise a very diverse habitat. The plants and animals are part of the ecosystem in the area and should be respected by visitors to the park. Animals visitors may see include black and grizzly bears, beavers, deer, moose, and smaller ground mammals. Certain seasons attract insects, like mosquitos, so visitors should be prepared. Many unique bird species exist in the park, including certain water birds. For example, loons, ospreys, and trumpeter swans are attracted to the park's many lakes and streams. Fishing the clear streams also provides the opportunity to see many different types of fish; for example, these streams spawn all five species of Pacific salmon. The tundra is also home to many unique plant species which are able to survive the winter and summer without dying, and along waterways many different trees and plants can be found.

After being released from prison due to his political activities and as an act of defiance against the policies of the deposed former Emir Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, Nasser bin Abdullah led the entire Al Muhannada clan into self-imposed exile to Kuwait in 1964. Nasser returned to Qatar with his immediate family in 1977, the year in which his daughter Moza married Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, when he was heir apparent of Qatar.

Druzhina, dru≈ºyna, or dru≈æyna (Slovak and ; ; Russian and , druzh√Ωna literally a \\"fellowship\\") in the medieval history of Kievan Rus' and Poland was a retinue in service of a Slavic chieftain, also called knyaz. The name is derived from the Slavic word drug (–¥—Ä—É–≥) with the meaning of \\"companion, friend\\". The English equivalent is retinue. Early Rus In early Rus a druzhina helped the prince administer his principality and constituted the area's military force. The first members of a druzhina in Rus Khaganate were the Varangians, whose princes established control there in the 9th century. Soon members of the local Slavic aristocracy as well as adventurers of a variety of other nationalities became druzhinniki. The druzhina organization varied with time and survived in one form or another until the 16th century. The druzhina was composed of two groups: the senior members, later known as boyars, and the junior members, later known as boyar scions. The boyars were the prince's closest advisers who also performed higher state functions. The junior members constituted the prince's personal bodyguard and were common soldiers. Members were dependent upon their prince for financial support, but they served the prince freely and had the right to leave him and join the druzhina of another prince. As a result, a prince was inclined to seek the goodwill of his druzhina by paying the druzhinniki wages, sharing his war booty and taxes with them, and eventually rewarding the boyars with landed estates, complete with rights to tax and administer justice to the local population. At the Battle of Lake Peipus the army of the Novgorod Republic had about 5000 men in all, and around 3000 men in both the cavalry and infantry were part of Alexander Nevsky's druzhina.

He first went to the land of present- day Israel in 1924 as an ardent Zionist. He married and moved to Poland in 1927 where he lived with his wife's parents during her pregnancy and played a part in trying to rescue European Jews from the Nazi plan to eliminate them as Germany conquered the countries of Europe during the 1939-1945 Second World War. He moved to the U.S. in 1943 where he became an accredited correspondent to the United Nations and founded the United Israel World Union. The purpose of his organization was to preach a universal Hebraic faith for all humankind based on the Decalogue and the other universal commandments of the Torah. The hallmark of the organization was Isaiah's prescription that: > My house will become a house of prayer for all peoples ... This is the same verse that Herbert W. Armstrong used for his reason to build the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, California, and Armstrong once announced a plan to assist in the building of a Jewish/Christian/Islamic center at Mount Sinai with the blessings of both Egyptian and Israeli leaders. Horowitz authored State in the Making (1953, Knopf, NY), recounting his contributions to the creation of the State of Israel. He was also the long- time editor of the United Nations Correspondents Association's quarterly newsletter and was the author of the 1986 biography \\"Pastor Charles Taze Russell: An Early American Christian Zionist.\\" The book detailed the pro- Zionism writings and sermons of the founder of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, better known as the Jehovah's Witness movement.

It has been closed since the rockfall that occurred on Mother's Day in 1999. Although people caught entering the park are subject to hefty fines, hikers continue to trespass into the park 20 years later. The park encompasses Kaluanui gulch and the waterfalls at its end, after which it is named. It is a place in Koolaolao, with much associated Hawaiian lore: \\"Kaliuwaa (sic) is the most famous of all the valleys in the district of Koolauloa.\\" According to Hawaiian beliefs, visitors were encouraged to lay leaves and place stones on them, as they entered the valley, gorge, and falls to show respect to the demigod associated with the location. Definition Kamapua'a, demigod, wood sculptor Kaliuwaa, also known as Sacred Falls, is the valley, the perpendicular cliffs, streams, and falls (Sacred Falls), located in Hauula, Oahu. A short distance below the falls is a trough-like gouge up the cliff where the pig demigod, Kamapuaa, is believed to have leaned against the cliff so that members of his family might climb up his body and escape their enemies. The stream and valley are also called Kaluanui. Mother's Day tragedy The park was closed indefinitely after a fatal rockfall near the waterfall on May 9, 1999, that killed eight hikers and injured many others. Over twenty incidents where people (tourists and locals alike) had been killed or injured had occurred at Sacred Falls. After the rockfall, most of the injured were lifted by stretcher suspended from helicopter, and first responders slowly carried the other victims 2.2 miles out of the park. Prohibited access While state officials employ many tactics to discourage visitors from illegally entering the closed park, the visitors enter anyway.KITV Honolulu News article from 2010 on the likelihood of a reopening of the park Many people disregard the danger and the warnings and say people should be allowed to go there \\"at their own risk\\", others acknowledge the risk is not worth it. Kaliuwa ªa (Sacred Falls) Because of the danger to first responders and to the public, the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement (DOCARE) has been strictly enforcing and citing people $2500 for a first violation of entering the closed park, $5000 for a second violation, and $10000 for the third violation. The signs posted at the entrance of the park have a QR code, targeting smart phone users, who can scan the QR code and watch a video detailing information about the location, on their mobile device.

Half of the levels are side-scrolling, 3D fighting levels, with the player controlling an Eva, while the other half involve their own styles of play. The game has 13 missions, each focusing on one of the major enemies of the series. Gameplay Unit 01 fighting Sachiel. For most of the game the player controls Unit 01. The gameplay is mostly a fighting game between the Evas and Angels. There are three ways the player can play. The most common gameplays is Plain Fighting, where the player takes control of an Eva on a \\"3D-2D\\" Course, walking back and forth, attacking the enemy. The battles are mainly focused on pressing correct commands to activate cinematic attacks and grabs known as \\"Actions\\", while basics attacks are secondary. Another gameplay style used in the game is weponring. Various parts of the game include minigames as missions, where the player takes control of the Eva's weponring in order to accomplish a mission or objective. The final gameplay element used is free-for-all, where the player is still on a \\"3D-2D\\" Plane, but can move freely back and forth. This mode is used in missions 12, 12.5 and 13.

It quickly outgrew its first building and moved into a new one in 1874. This building, the Old United States Mint, also known affectionately as The Granite Lady, is one of the few that survived the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake. It served until 1937, when the present facility was opened. Old Mint Within the first year of its operation, the San Francisco mint turned $4 million in gold bullion into coins. The second building, completed in 1874, was designed by Alfred B. Mullett in a conservative Greek Revival style with a sober Doric order. The building had a central pedimented portico flanked by projecting wings in an E-shape; it was built around a completely enclosed central courtyard that contained a well--the features that saved it during the fire of 1906, when the heat melted the plate glass windows and exploded sandstone and granite blocks with which it was faced. The building sat on a concrete and granite foundation, designed to thwart tunneling into its vaults, which at the time of the 1906 fire held $300 million, fully a third of the United States' gold reserves. Efforts by Superintendent of the Mint, Frank A. Leach, and his men preserved the building and the bullion that then backed the nation's currency. The mint resumed operation soon thereafter, continuing until 1937. In 1961 the Old Mint, as it had become known, was designated a National Historic Landmark.James Dillon (March 30, 1976) , National Park Service and It also became a California Historical Landmark in 1974. The given name of \\"The Granite Lady\\" is somewhat of a misnomer as most of the building is made from sandstone. While the base/basement of the building is made of granite, the entire external and upper stories are made of sandstone. The Granite Lady was a marketing term given in the 1970s that stuck. The Old Mint was open to visitors until 1993. In 2003 the federal government sold the structure to the City of San Francisco for one dollar--an 1879 silver dollar struck at the mint-- for use as a historical museum to be called the San Francisco Museum at the Mint. In the fall of 2005, ground was broken for renovations that would turn the central court into a glass-enclosed galleria. In 2006 Congress created the San Francisco Old Mint Commemorative Coin, the first coin to honor a United States mint (). The first phase of renovations were completed in 2011. In 2014, the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society began raising money for the second phase, which would have included permanent exhibitions. In 2015, the City of San Francisco looked for a new tenant to renovate and program the space with Activate San Francisco Events being selected as an interim tenant. As the City's 2016 public re-opening event, continuing the tradition of a similar event from past years, on the first weekend in March, the Old Mint hosted a \\"San Francisco History Days\\" event with over sixty participating historic organizations. Until a new tenant is found, the Old Mint will continue to be used for special events, some open to the public. In April 2016, the California Historical Society agreed to undertake the restoration of the building and its preservation as a public space. New Mint The new San Francisco Mint building, built in 1937 (2007) The new Mint was opened in 1937. Beginning in 1955, circulating coinage from San Francisco was suspended for 13 years. In 1968, it took over most proof coinage production from the Philadelphia Mint, but continued striking a supplemental circulating coinage from 1968 through 1974. Since 1975, the San Francisco Mint has been used almost exclusively for proof coinage, with the exception of the Susan B. Anthony dollar from 1979‚Äì81, a portion of the mintage of cents in the early 1980s, and circulation-strike America the Beautiful quarters marked with an \\"S\\" mintmark and only issued for collectors since 2012. The dollars and quarters bear a mintmark of an \\"S\\", but the cents are otherwise indistinguishable from those minted at Philadelphia (which bear no mintmarks, unlike those years' proof cents from San Francisco and circulation cents from Denver). From 1962 to 1988, the San Francisco Mint was officially an assay office; the San Francisco Assay Office was granted mint status again on March 31, 1988 (). The San Francisco Mint is located at 155 Hermann Street, but only admits visitors on rare exception. On May 15, 1987, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Mint, a limited number of people were allowed to tour the facility. This tour was advertised in the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper, with a phone number to call to reserve a spot. Commemoratives = San Francisco Old Mint Gold = In 2006, the United States Mint released a gold five dollar commemorative coin which commemorates the 100th year after the old San Francisco mint survived an earthquake. The mint also played a part in the city's recovery after the earthquake, providing shelter for many as it was one of the few buildings left standing. The coin was minted as both a proof coin and an uncirculated coin, and is no longer available directly from the United States Mint. On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush signed Public Law 109-230, legislation authorizing the production of the 2006 San Francisco $5 commemorative gold coin as well as its $1 silver counterpart. The production of the $5 denomination was limited to a maximum mintage of 100,000 coins, but separate mintage figures for each of the proof and uncirculated coins have not yet been released. The $1 silver version was limited to only 500,000 coins, both in proof and uncirculated products, but distinct mintage figures for both products has not been officially stated. The reverse was designed by Christian Gobrecht and sculpted by Joseph Menna.

Generally considered the ancestor of all subsequent hurdy-gurdies, the organistrum differs substantially from later instruments in that it was played by two individuals: one turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward to change the musical pitch of the melody strings. Origins The word organistrum is derived from organum and instrumentum; the former term was applied to the primitive harmonies, consisting of octaves accompanied by fourths or fifths, first practised by Hucbald in the 10th century. This explanation enables us to fix with tolerable certainty the date of the invention of the organistrum, at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century, and also to understand the construction of the instrument. A stringed instrument of the period ‚Äî such as a guitar fiddle, a rotta or oval vielle ‚Äî being used as model, the proportions were increased for the convenience of holding the instrument and of dividing the performance between two persons. Inside the body was the wheel, having a tire of leather well rosined, and working easily through an aperture in the soundboard. The three strings resting on the wheel and supported besides on a bridge of the same height all sounded at once as the wheel revolved, and in the earliest examples the wooden tangents taking the place of fingers on the frets of the neck acted upon all three strings at once, thus producing the harmony known as organum. Organistrum in art Sketch of the Boscherville relief The organistrum appears on a bas-relief from the abbey of St Georges de Boscherville (11th century), now preserved in the museum of Rouen, where it is played by a royal lady, her maid turning the crank. It has the place of honour in the centre of the band of musicians representing the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse in the tympanum of the Gate of Glory of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (12th century). There is also a fine example in a miniature of a psalter of English workmanship (12th century), forming part of the Hunterian collection in Glasgow University; this was shown at the Exhibition of Illuminated MSS. at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1908.

Historically in Lancashire, it is in the Tottington ward of Bury Metropolitan Borough Council and the Bury North parliamentary constituency, whose current MP is James Daly. It is in the West Pennine Moors and shares a border with Bolton in North West England. History =Toponymy= Affetside is derived from the Old English ofer (\\"border or boundary\\") and side (\\"hillside\\"), meaning the boundary on the hill, which is appropriate as its highest point is 900 ft (277 m) above sea level. The boundary follows the route of the Roman road known as Watling Street that ran from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) built in about 72AD. Affetside has been recorded with various spellings since the 16th century: Avesyde, Haffetside, Affaitsyde, Offyside, Affetsid. The present spelling was first recorded in 1504. =History= The village is situated on the Roman road between Manchester and Ribchester. The main street was called Watling Street. Development of the village accelerated in the 1700s when it provided grazing, blacksmiths and inns to travellers using the packhorse route. The Pack Horse Inn was built in 1443. A day school opened in Affetside Chapel in 1879. As the building was shared, the congregation put out desks on Monday mornings and removed them on Friday in preparation for the Sunday service and did so until the school closed in August 2003. The village lost 15 church and school members in the First World War. The chapel congregation raised funds for a memorial and purchased a new organ which was unveiled in 1920 and is still in use. In 1955 Tottington Urban District Council suggested demolishing sub-standard cottages in the village and rehousing the occupants in Tottington. The suggestion was overwhelmingly unpopular. A battle for piped water caused residents to form an action group and piped water was supplied to the village from 1976. Local historian James Francis, and author of Affetside, an historical survey, believes the village's strength shows through its survival. He says: :\\"The building of the local turnpike road was the death knell for the packhorse trains, but the Affetsiders showed great resilience in continuing to build up their village, and so the village did not collapse like others, less fortunate. For such a small village, with only about 150 people to still have a church and pub says a lot about the people who live there.\\" Governance For many years the road through the village was the boundary between the townships of Bradshaw and Tottington. After local government reform in 1894 the road marked the meeting point of Turton and Tottington urban districts and after reorganisation in 1974, the boundary marked the meeting of Bolton and Bury Metropolitan Boroughs. In 1991 the anomaly was removed by extending the boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury to the west of Watling Street. Geography The village lies north west of Tottington, west of Greenmount and Hawkshaw and south of Edgworth. Economy The villagers travel to nearby towns for work. In 1921 the first (and last) Holcombe Hunt point to point steeplechase was run. An estimated 100,000 visitors arrived to watch. Families turned their houses into shops providing refreshments and farmers sold milk. The steeplechase course over jumps and two brooks was a success but subsequently the event was held at Nab Fold in Harwood. Landmarks =Affetside Cross= Affetside Cross The cross is a grade II listed structure. Its shaft is made from a single piece of gritstone on a plinth consisting of two stone steps, one circular, 7.5 ft (2.28 m) in diameter, and 4 inches (0.1 m) high and a smaller one 5 ft 3 inches (1.6 m) in diameter and 10 inches (0.25 m) high. The shaft is a pillar with a square base 1 ft (0.34 m) wide tapering to a column 4 ft 8 inches (1.43 m) high. At 4 ft 4 inches (1.34m) there is a collar with a bun-shaped capital. On its top is a socket that may have held the cross head or stone ball. Affetside Cross was damaged in the 1890s by people mistakenly believing it concealed hidden treasure, and was repaired by the Lord of the Manor. It marks the supposed halfway point between London and Edinburgh and Its origin remains a mystery though it is thought to date from medieval times or earlier. Its proximity to the Roman road has caused many to speculate it to be Roman but others consider it a medieval route marker for pilgrims en route to Whalley Abbey. There is another such cross at Holcombe Moor to the east and one at Bradshaw which has been removed. The theory is plausible as the old east‚Äìwest packhorse trail was a major route for the passage of goods and people. Another explanation is it is a market cross from Jacobean or Georgian times but Affetside had no market charter though markets did exist without one. It may mark the site of an earlier beacon due to its dominant position. The loss of the cross head is undated and there is no proof it had one. Community The Affetside Society is concerned with the appearance and amenities in the village. It lobbied Bury Metropolitan Borough Council to provide traffic calming measures to reduce the number of serious accidents caused by speeding vehicles. In November 2011 the traffic calming work was approved by the council, with a 20 mph speed limit becoming permanent and traffic chicanes and road markings to be implemented in early 2012. In 1981, the society planted daffodil bulbs, shrubs and trees along Watling Street to improve its appearance and built stone signs at each end of the village. It organises social events on the Millennium Green and distributes a newsletter to residents. The Millennium Green Trust, a registered charity, was formed to provide and oversee the \\"Millennium Green\\" in an initiative run by the Countryside Commission. It created a public open space on the disused bus turn-around next to the cross, which acts as a focal point for village activities. The village green is used for a spring boules competition, summer barbecues and the Christmas Carol service. In January 2007, Bury Council considered making the village a conservation area to protect against what some see as misguided refurbishment and extension to old properties built in the pre-1800s Pennine vernacular. In May 2008, the council decided against the proposal after a community consultation in the village church.

He studied under Zeno of Sidon in Athens, before moving to Rome, and then to Herculaneum. He was once known chiefly for his poetry preserved in the Greek Anthology, but since the 18th century, many writings of his have been discovered among the charred papyrus rolls at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. The task of excavating and deciphering these rolls is difficult, and work continues to this day. The works of Philodemus so far discovered include writings on ethics, theology, rhetoric, music, poetry, and the history of various philosophical schools. Barker 1908 suggested he was owner of the Villa of the Papyri Library. Life Philodemus was born c. 110 BC, in Gadara, Coele-Syria (in present-day Jordan).Blank, David, \\"Philodemus\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), accessed 3 June 2020. He studied under the Epicurean Phoenician philosopher, Zeno of Sidon, the head (scholarch) of the Epicurean school, in Athens, before settling in Rome about 80 BC. He was a follower of Zeno, but an innovative thinker in the area of aesthetics, in which conservative Epicureans had little to contribute. He was a friend of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, and was implicated in Piso's profligacy by Cicero,Cicero, In Pisonem, 68‚Äì72 who, however, praises Philodemus warmly for his philosophic views and for the elegans lascivia of his poems.cf. Horace, Satires, i. 2. 120 Philodemus was an influence on Horace's Ars Poetica. The Greek anthology contains thirty-four of his epigrams - most of them, love poems. The Villa of the Papyri There was an extensive library at Piso's Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, a significant part of which was formed by a library of Epicurean texts, some of which were present in more than one copy, suggesting the possibility that this section of Piso's library was Philodemus' own. The contents of the villa were buried in the eruption of Vesuvius, 79 CE, and the papyri were carbonized and flattened but preserved. During the 18th-century exploration of the Villa by tunnelling, from 1752 to 1754 there were recovered carbonized papyrus rolls containing thirty-six treatises attributed to Philodemus. These works deal with music, rhetoric, ethics, signs, virtues and vices, the good king, and defend the Epicurean standpoint against the Stoics and the Peripatetics. The first fragments of Philodemus from Herculaneum were published in 1824. In 2019, a scroll on the history of Plato's Academy, which had been unrolled and glued to cardboard in 1795, was analyzed using shortwave-infrared hyperspectral imaging. This not only revealed what was written on the back of the scroll, but also illuminated 150 new words on the front. \\"The difficulties involved in unrolling, reading, and interpreting these texts were formidable. Naples was not a particularly hospitable destination for classical scholars. Finally, the philosophies of the Hellenistic schools were neither well-known nor highly regarded until quite recently. These factors combined to cripple scholarly interest in and use of the Herculaneum papyri. Recently, however, in part due to the efforts of the International Center for the Study of the Herculaneum Papyri, these rolls have been the object of renewed scholarly work and have yielded many findings indispensable for the study of Hellenistic philosophy.\\"The Philodemus Project Today researchers work from digitally enhanced photographs, infra-red and multiple-imaging photography, and 18th- century transcriptions of the documents, which were being destroyed as they were being unrolled and transcribed. The actual papyri are in the National Library, Naples. Named for the philosopher poet, the Philodemus Project is an international effort, supported by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and by contributions of individuals and participating universities, to reconstruct new texts of Philodemus' works on Poetics, Rhetoric, and Music. These texts will be edited and translated and published in a series of volumes by Oxford University Press. Philodemus: On Poems. I, edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary by Richard Janko, appeared in 2001 and won the Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit. \\"Philodemus‚Äô On Poems, in particular, opens a window onto a lost age of scholarship‚Äîthe period between Aristotle's Poetics and Horace's Art of Poetry, the works which define classicism for the ancient and modern worlds,\\" Janko has written. The Project's next volumes are scheduled to be: *On Poems V, edited and translated by David Armstrong, James Porter, Jeffrey Fish, and Cecilia Mangoni *On Rhetoric I-II, edited and translated by David Blank *On Rhetoric III, edited and translated by Dirk Obbink and Juergen Hammerstaedt. Inductive reasoning In On Methods of Inference, Philodemus comments on the problem of induction, doubting the reliability of inductive reasoning from the observed to the unobserved. One problem is the existence of unique events that could never be guessed from what happens elsewhere. \\"There are also in our experience some infrequent occurrences, as for example the man in Alexandria half a cubit high, with a colossal head that could be beaten with a hammer, who used to be exhibited by the embalmers; the person in Epidaurus who was married as a young woman and then become a man.\\"Philodemus, On Methods of Inference, ed. P. De Lacy and E. De Lacy (Naples, 1978), pp. 92-3. Induction is also unreliable if it extrapolates far beyond our experience: \\"We shall not, therefore, use the [inference] that since the men among us are mortal the men in Libya would also be mortal, much less the inference that since the living beings among us are mortal, if there are any living beings in Britain, they would be mortal.\\"Philodemus, On Methods of Inference, pp. 96-99; J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore, 2001), pp. 201-2.

Of these, three major periods were largely responsible for shaping the current Malaysian system. The first was the founding of the Melaka Sultanate at the beginning of the 15th century; second was the spread of Islam in the indigenous culture; and finally, and perhaps the most significant in modern Malaysia, was British colonial rule which brought with it constitutional government and the common law system. Sultanate of Melaka During the realm of the Sultanate, Melaka was an important trading port and the maintenance of law and order was crucial to its prosperity. The administration of justice was placed under the direct charge of the bendahara (or chief minister) who exercised both political and judicial functions. The temenggung (which is the commander of troops and police) was responsible for apprehending criminals, maintaining prisons and generally keeping the peace. The welfare of foreigners residing in the state was looked after by several shahbandars (harbour masters and collectors of customs). Little is known of the legal system in those days but it is generally accepted that the law administered then was a combination of Muslim law and the \\"Adat Temenggung\\" (patriarchal Malay customary law). The \\"Adat Temengung\\" was the law of the Sultan or the law ordained by the rulers and later adopted in the other regions of Peninsular Malaysia. It was the basis of the law as found in Malay legal digests compiled between the 15th and 19th centuries. The formal legal text of traditional Melaka consisted of the Undang-Undang Melaka (Laws of Melaka), variously called the Hukum Kanun Melaka and Risalat Hukum Kanun, and the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka (the Maritime Laws of Melaka).Winstedt, Richard. The Date of the Malacca Legal Codes. ‚Äì The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 1/2, Apr. 1953. The laws as written in the legal digests went through an evolutionary process. The legal rules that eventually evolved were shaped by three main influences, namely the early non-indigenous Hindu/Buddhist tradition, Islam and the indigenous \\"adat\\". European and British influence When Melaka fell into the hands of the Portuguese from 1511 to 1641 and the Dutch from 1641 till 1786, the local people continued to practise Islamic laws and Malay customs. It could be said that the Portuguese and the Dutch laws made relatively little impact on the legal system as a whole other than the political and administrative structures. In 1786, Britain acquired the island of Penang, the first territory in Malaysia to fall into British hands. The main preoccupation of the British administrators during the first decades after the founding of Penang, was the maintenance of some form of order and to this end, local customs and law were allowed to continue but tempered by such portions of the English law as were considered just and expedient. Some judgements meted out may seem rather strange by today's standard but it should be borne in mind that they merely reflected the harsh and often chaotic conditions of those pioneering days. Complaints and petitions were made over many years for a better system of administering justice. Finally, it came in the form of the Royal Charter of Justice of 1807. The Charter is the most significant event in Malaysian legal history as it marked the beginning of the statutory introduction of English law into this country. The Charter established the Court of Judicature of the Prince of Wales' island (as Penang was then known) to exercise jurisdiction in all civil, criminal and ecclesiastical matters. It was interpreted by the courts as introducing to Penang the law of England as it stood in 1807 insofar as it was suitable to local conditions and circumstances. When Penang, Singapore, which was founded by the British in 1819 along with Melaka, which fell to the British as a trade-off under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, formed the Straits Settlement in 1826, a new charter, the Charter of Justice was introduced. A new court called 'The Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Melaka\\" was created by this Charter. Penang in a sense had a second statutory reception of English law although it was the first for Singapore and Melaka. In one stroke of the pen, the Straits Settlements received a large dose of English law. Despite the new Charter, the administration of justice was far from satisfactory. A third Charter of Justice was granted in 1855 which enabled the reorganisation of the court system. In 1867, when the administration of the Straits Settlements from India was transferred to the Colonial Office, the court system was reorganised once again. By Ordinance 5 of 1868, the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Melaka was abolished. A new court known as the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. In 1873, the Supreme Court was further reorganised under four judges ‚Äì the Chief Justice, the Justice of Penang, the Senior Puisne Judge and the Junior Puisne Judge. The Court of Quarter Sessions was established as a criminal court and presided over by the Senior and Junior Puisne Judges in Singapore and Penang respectively. A Court of Appeal was also constituted. By then, the judiciary had slowly evolved into its modern form. English commercial law was formally introduced into the Straits Settlements by Section 6 of the Civil Law Ordinance, 1878. This provision, as re-enacted in the Civil Law Act, 1956 (Revised 1972), is still applicable in Penang and Melaka. English land law was specifically excluded by sub-section 2. The whole section of this Ordinance was incorporated into the Civil Law Ordinance of 1909 and later re-enacted as Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance (Chap. 42 of the 1936 Revised Edition). This was the legal situation in the Straits Settlements until its dissolution in 1946 following the formation of the Malayan Union. The statutory introduction of English law to the Federated Malay States comprising the states of Perak, Selangor, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan occurred in 1937 with the introduction of the Civil Law Enactment, 1937. The Unfederated Malay States, consisting the states of Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Johor, became part of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Civil Law (Extension) Ordinance, 1951, extended the application of the Enactment to these states. Both enactments were replaced by the Civil Law Ordinance, 1956, which applied to all eleven states of the Federation. When Malaysia was established in 1963, it became necessary to harmonise the law to take effect in Sabah and Sarawak. The 1956 Ordinance was then superseded by the Civil Law Act, 1956 (revised 1972) which came into force on 1 April 1972. Notes Bibliography * Undang-Undang Melaka & Undang-Undang Laut.

This eGovernment process was to help combine unemployment insurance and welfare, but has instead become one of the many difficulties associated with the Hartz IV reforms in Germany.  Development  A2LL was first developed by a consortium of T-Systems, the software division of the former German state telecommunications company, and ProSoz, with a team of 30 developers, in the town of Herten. The software, which was delivered late in the last quarter of 2004, went live on January 1, 2005. It is now only maintained by T-Systems, since ProSoz left the consortium in May 2005, allegedly due to being on the brink of bankruptcy, (according to the local paper \\"Hertener Allgemeine\\").  Technology  The software is used in the social services offices through a web browser interface using secure communication. Administrative changes are only possible by direct access to the system via intranet of the Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit - the social services agency responsible for administrating welfare. The system is based on 16 servers with 4 processors each, all running Linux. A Tomcat servlet container defines the graphical user interface. A web services framework from the Systinet company, uses a server farm of approximately 200 Windows 2003 servers which run the application server developed by ProSoz. The application server was developed using Microsoft's (D)COM technology and uses an Informix 9.4x database running on a Solaris machine containing 80 CPUs and a 300 GB Cache- RAM.  History  The software was delivered to large German cities such as Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Berlin on October 18, 2004. Other towns followed on October 21, although only 20% of the end user stations were permitted to use the system, to keep it from going down. More and more stations were soon added to the system, but there were many problems with the extremely slow response and data entry times. Staff in the social services agencies had to work overtime to get as much data into the system as possible before the start. On December 23, 2004, the system had 2.6 million households registered and the FINAS booking system was prepared to send out 1.3 billion euros to accounts across the nation on January 1. The first major error was found during the first payment - account numbers which were shorter than the standard 10 digits were filled up with zeros on the end instead of the beginning (i.e., 1234567 became 1234567000 instead of the correct 0001234567). The banks could not process the payments and thus had to be credited to fragment accounts until they could be sorted out. Due to the massive number of mistakes, the banks had to invest much effort into locating the owners, and the government had to issue emergency cash so that people could buy food. As a quick fix the system switched to printing checks (not normally used in German financial transactions), but since the field for the street name chosen was too small, many of the checks could not be delivered to the intended recipients. The software house ProSoz, a wholly owed subsidiary of the city of Herten, was on the brink of bankruptcy and resigned from the consortium. T-Systems hired the programmers from the company. Even six months after the start of the system, there were many needed features of the system that could not be used. For example, neither an analysis of variance nor a list of persons who had received too much money could be printed. The printing of documents was not flexible enough to fit many local situations. New legal rules for deducting current income from small jobs could not be completed in time for the official start of the system on October 1, 2005. In July 2005 it was discovered that the system could not cope with one-time payments, for example so that schoolchildren could purchase books; consequently, this feature was disabled entirely. A few days later it was discovered that the system was not registering people properly with their insurance companies, causing enormous administrative headaches for the insurance providers. In September 2005 the German press reported that the system had been transferring 25 million euros too much per month to the insurance providers. This meant that they could not calculate the new, lower insurance rate that was mandated to save the government money. According to press reports, an expert committee had determined the software to be non-maintainable and non-adaptable and was considering a completely new software system, just 9 months after it had gone into operation.

It is native to Southern Africa, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. It is the only species in the genus Ptaeroxylon.  Background  Ptaeroxylon obliquum is a species from the family Rutaceae which are most abundant in South Africa and Australia. The term ptaeroxylon is Greek for sneeze and wood, while obliquum denotes the oblique shape of the leaflets. The wood produces oils containing nieshoutol, which causes violent sneeze attacks by workers who are exposed to the tree. Though sneezewood is not poisonous, it has been known to cause respiratory complications. It has been linked to asthma, rhinitis and mucosal inflammation.  Description  foliage male flowers Ptaeroxylon obliquum is a shrub or medium deciduous tree that stands up to tall. The bark is whitish-grey and smooth when young, but fissured with age. Leaflets are 2.5 x 1.3 cm marked asymmetrically. They are blue-green to dark green in color and crowd near the ends of the rachis in three to seven pairs of leaflets. The flowers on the tree are white to creamy yellow and fragrant. Sneezewood is very dense having a specific gravity of 1040 kg/m3  Uses  =Lumber= Sneezewood is an extremely hard and durable timber wood. It often lasts longer than brass or iron when used for machine bearings. In the past, sneezewood was used extensively for railway sleepers. It can also be used to make furniture. In Mozambique it is used to make xylophone keys. Sneezewood is a very attractive wood with golden heartwood with light orange figures and is a favorite amongst woodturners. Its scarcity today is due in part of its past use as fuel for steam tugs. It has been used extensively for fence and telegraph poles as well. =Medicinal= Sneezewood is used for medicinal and ritual purposes. The bark can be used to repel moths or as snuff. The resin has been used to get rid of warts and cattle ticks. The Xhosa have traditionally made snuff from sneeze-wood to relieve headaches.

Hongwu reign (1368-1398) Early in his reign, Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming emperor, laid down instructions to later generations that included advice to the Chief Military Commission on those countries that posed a threat to the Ming polity, and those that did not. He stated that those to the north were dangerous, while those to the south did not constitute a threat, and were not to be subject to attack. Yet, either despite this, or as a result of it, it was the polities to the south that suffered the greatest effects of Ming expansion over the following century. =Conquest of Yunnan= A Chinese cannon, or eruptor, which fired proto- shells as cast iron bombs. In 1369, not long after Zhu Yuanzhang founded his new dynasty, he sent proclamations for the instruction of the countries of Yunnan and Japan.Wade, 2004, p. 4; also see Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu, 9 Mar 1369 This early recognition of Yunnan (which lay beyond the Ming) as a \\"country\\" was to change very soon thereafter. By 1380, Yunnan, which was still held by a Mongol prince, was considered to belong to China since the Han dynasty, and 250,000 troops were deployed in an attack on the polity, taking Dali, Lijiang and Jinchi in 1382. As a result, the Ming founder took control of the major urban centers of the north-western part of what is today Yunnan, including several Tai areas. By 1387, Ming Taizu had set his sights further and prepared for an attack on the Baiyi (M√∂ng Mao) polity to the south. Under the commander Mu Ying, the Ming forces attacked the Baiyi with firearms, taking a claimed 30,000 heads.Southeast Asia in the Ming Shilu, 6 May 1388 Si Lunfa was subsequently dunned for all the costs of the military expedition against him, as a quid pro quo for recognizing him as ruler of the Baiyi. The new polities \\"created\\" (or recognized) in Yunnan under the first Ming ruler were known to the Ming as \\"native offices\\" (tu si), since initially they were usually left under the control of the hereditary rulers, by which the Ming exerted control, and engaged in economic expropriation through tribute demands and other levies. Che-li (Jinghong), for example, was established as a \\"native office\\" in 1377. Here, then, was the beginnings of the process by which formerly Southeast Asian polities were gradually absorbed into the Chinese polity. As a result, the new polities were subjected to a wide range of tribute demands, labor, and other levies, including troop provision. As an example, in the case of the Tai-Mao polity of Lu-Chuan/Ping-Mian, the Ming court demanded 15,000 horses, 500 elephants and 30,000 cattle from the ruler Si Lunfa in 1397. Subsequently, large silver demands (silver, in lieu of labor) were levied on Lu-Chuan. The annual amount of 6,900 Liang of silver was initially set, and then it was almost tripled to 18,000 Liang. When it was realized that this was impossible to meet, the levy was reduced to the original amount. Other diverse levies were applied to the other polities, enforced through the use or threat of military force. =Maritime policies= The Hongwu reign was marked by frequent despatch of envoys to foreign polities, and the court reception of foreign envoys from the maritime polities of Vietnam, Champa, Cambodia, Siam, Cochin, Sanfoqi, Java, Japan, Ry≈´ky≈´, Brunei, and Korea. They were drawn to China by the trade concessions available to tribute envoys, and the rewards given to the rulers who submitted the \\"tribute\\". However, the machinations of the Ming state meant that diplomatic links were also a major method by which court insiders, within the system, could gain influence and control. It was the failure to report the arrival of an envoy from Champa that led to Hu Weiyong (ËÉ°ÊÉüÂ∫∏), the Ming prime minister from 1377 to 1380, being executed on charges of treason. Members of the Ming bureaucracy were likely already heavily involved in Southeast Asian maritime politics by the 1390s. In the early 1370s, the coastal people in China were forbidden to cross the oceans, other than on official missions. Fujian military officials, who had privately sent people across the seas to engage in trade, were punished not long thereafter. The prohibition was reinstated in 1381 and 1384, and an imperial command \\"strictly prohibiting people from having contact with foreigners\\" was promulgated in 1390. The frequency of these prohibitions suggests that they were not very effective, and the reason given for the imperial command was that \\"at this time in Guangdong/Guangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian, there were foolish people who did not know of these prohibitions, and frequently engaged in private trade with foreigners\\". The prohibition on going abroad to trade privately was reiterated in 1397. Whether these prohibitions actually affected maritime trade between southern China and Southeast Asia is not immediately apparent from the Ming texts, and perhaps through further archaeological research, it will be possible to piece together the ebbs and flows in maritime trade between China and Southeast Asia during this period. Yongle reign (1403-1424) Knowledge of the reign of Ming Taizu's successor, the Jianwen Emperor (1399-1402), has been almost entirely lost to us as a result of the civil war and coup d'√©tat launched by his uncle, Zhu Di. In the aftermath, Zhu Di tried to eliminate all evidence of his nephew's reign from the historical record. As such, the links between Ming China and Southeast Asia in this crucial period must remain in the realm of conjecture. The period of Yongle, as Zhu Di was to name his reign, is however, very well-documented, and it is this period in which many of the most dramatic Ming interactions with Southeast Asia occurred. Like his father, after coming to power, Zhu Di ordered the Ministry of Rites to send demands to foreign polities, requiring them to bring tribute to the court. In the same year, he also established the Maritime Trade Supervisorates in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong to control sea trade with all foreign polities. In 1405, hostels were established under each of the above-noted provinces to look after the foreign envoys who came from abroad. It was already apparent at this early stage of the reign that the Yongle Emperor was planning to have much to do with maritime Asia. At the same time, the new emperor was also anxious to advertise the cultural superiority of the Ming to the rest of the known world and to this end, he distributed 10,000 copies of the Biographies of Exemplary Women (ÁÉàÂ•≥ÂÇ≥) to various non-Chinese polities for their moral instruction. Whether any motifs from this Chinese text have appeared in Southeast Asian literature, has not yet, it appears, been studied. Court calendars were also distributed to Southeast Asian polities by the Ministry of Rites. =Invasion of Vietnam= A number of major military expeditions into Southeast Asia occurred during the Yongle reign. In 1406, in an effort to increase Ming influence and power in ƒê·∫°i Ngu (Vietnam), the country that was known to the Ming as Annam (the \\"Pacified South\\"), it had appeared that H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly, a powerful noble of Vietnam had seized power in Vietnam and attempted to murder all members of the current Tr·∫ßn ruling family. The Yongle emperor attempted to solve the problem peacefully, dispatching envoys and the self-claimed surviving member of the House of Tr·∫ßn, Tr·∫ßn Thi√™n B√≠nh (Èô≥Ê∑ªÂπ≥) to Vietnam. He was assassinated and in that same year, two huge Chinese armies were sent along two routes, via Yunnan and Guangxi, into ƒê·∫°i Ngu. Chinese forces claimed that seven million Vietnamese were killed in this initial campaign to take the polity. In 1407, ƒê·∫°i Ngu became Ming China's 14th province, and remained so until 1428, when the Ming were forced to withdraw by a Vietnamese independence movement led by L√™ L·ª£i. In contrast to the name Annam (\\"Pacified South\\"), this 21-year period was one of almost incessant fighting. Ming-era matchlock firearms used in the 15th to 17th centuries. As soon as the Ming forces took control of the polity, changes were instituted. In the first year, 7,600 tradesmen and artisans (including gun founders) captured in ƒê·∫°i Ngu were sent to the Ming capital at today's Nanjing. This stripping of some of the most skilled members of society extensively affected Vietnamese society. Subsequently, more Chinese and non-Chinese troops were brought into the region to maintain some semblance of control, and a wide range of new organs of civil administration were re-established. By 1408, Annam had 41 subprefectures, and 208 counties, all administered in a Chinese mode but often staffed by Vietnamese. Regardless of the extent to which political hegemony was thrown off in the late 1420s, when the Ming were driven out, the administrative legacy of the Chinese occupation must have had a major and wide-ranging impact on the society of the country. In a claimed effort to further inculcate Chinese ways, Confucian schools, which existed already from several hundred years before, were re-established in Chinese style, and Chinese were appointed to teach in them. In an attempt to assimilate the country into the Chinese cultural sphere, this period saw an invaluable part of Vietnamese academic and historical works destroyed by the Ming authorities. In 1407 a new Maritime Trade Supervisorate was established at Yuntun, while two new such offices were established at Xinping (Êñ∞Âπ≥) and Shunhua (È†ÜÂåñ) in 1408. Thus, within two years, three maritime trade supervisors had been created in this new province, the same number as existed in the rest of China. This was a clear indication of the desire of the Ming to control maritime trade to the south and exploit the economic advantage of such control. Other economic exploitation involved grain taxes, annual levies of lacquer, sappanwood, kingfisher feathers, fans and aromatics, and the imposition of monopolies on gold, silver, salt, iron, and fish. In addition, eunuchs were sent to Jiaozhi with the task of collecting treasure for the Emperor, but an equal amount of treasure collection appears to have been done for themselves. The rapaciousness of the eunuchs, at least as depicted in Ming accounts, was such that even the emperors intervened in appointments. The Hongxi Emperor objected to the re-sending of the eunuch Ma Qi to Annam, when he attempted to have himself reappointed to control the gold, silver, aromatics and pearls of the region in 1424. By 1414, the Ming was sufficiently well-entrenched in the northern Annam to allow it to push further, establishing four further subprefectures in a region south of Annam, which had formerly been administered by the H·ªì dynasty and still free from Chinese influence, as well as some parts of the northern border of Champa. There are authors who believe that the Chinese occupation of √ê·∫°i Vi·ªát in this period played some role in the later southward expansion of the Vietnamese state. However, the Vietnamese southward expansion had begun in the L√Ω dynasty of √ê·∫°i Vi·ªát and the major advances were made by Nguy·ªÖn Lords at least two centuries later. The levies and demands made on the new province by the Ming meant that its capacity to feed itself suffered. On numerous occasions in the 1420s, it was necessary to arrange transport of grain from Guangdong and Guangxi into Jiaozhi. Such deficiencies would have had profound effects on the social structure and social stability of the region, compounded by warfare and the imposition of Chinese norms. The range of colonial policies the Ming pursued had wide- ranging effects, both on the society at the time, as well as on the future development of the Vietnamese state. =Conquest of Tai polities= Prior to Yongle's invasion of √ê·∫°i Ngu in 1406, he engaged himself in further expansion into the polities of Yunnan. By 1403, he had created new military guards on the distant border, with two independent battalions, directly under the Regional Military Commission, being established at Tengchong and Yongchang in 1403. These were to be the bases from which the subsequent further occupation and control of the Tai regions were to be pursued. In the same year, new Chief's Offices were established in Yunnan, at Zhele Dian, Dahou, Ganyai, Wandian and Lujiang, and in 1406, a further four Chief's Offices were established under Ningyuan Guard, in what is today Sip Song Chau Tai in Vietnam. When the Tai polities did not submit to the requirements of the new Ming emperor, military actions were launched against them. In 1405, for example, the senior Chinese representative in Yunnan, Mu Sheng, launched an attack on Lanna (Babai). After some sort of recognition or acceptance of the superior position of the Ming court, Chinese clerks or registry managers were appointed to the \\"native offices\\" to \\"assist\\" the traditional ruler, and ensure that Ming interests were served. Chinese clerks were appointed to carry out Chinese language duties in the native offices of Yunnan in 1404, while similar circulating-official clerk positions (to be filled by Chinese) were established in seven Chief's Offices in Yunnan in 1406. The \\"native office\\" polities were then subject to demands in terms of gold and silver in lieu of labor (Â∑ÆÁôºÈäÄ/Èáë), administered by the Ministry of Revenue, and were also required to provide troops to assist in further Ming campaigns. Mubang, for example, was required to send its troops against Lanna (Babai) in 1406. This pattern of exploitation continued through the reign.

The federal government, which had recently acquired California after defeating Mexico in the Mexican War, signed a treaty (one of eighteen such treaties signed state-wide, setting aside seven and a half percent of California's land area) defining a proposed reservation and two hundred head of cattle per year. The US Senate failed to ratify any of the eighteen treaties in a secret vote cast on July 8, 1852, with every member either abstaining or voting no. The result of the vote was not made public until 1905. The newly organized state government took a different approach. In 1851, California Governor Peter Burnett said that unless the Indians were moved east of the Sierras, ‚Äòa war of extermination would continue to be waged until the Indian race should become extinct.' Over the course of the next 50 years, settlers and eventually the California State Militia would wage war on the Yokuts and other native tribes in what became known as the Californian Genocide. The Yokuts were reduced by around 93% between 1850 and 1900, with many of the survivors being forced into indentured servitude sanctioned by the California State Act for the Government and Protection of Indians. A few Valley Yokuts remain, the most prominent tribe among them being the Tachi. Kroeber estimated the population of the Yokuts in 1910 as 600. Today about 2000 Yokuts are enrolled in the federally recognized tribe. An estimated 600 Yokuts are said to belong to unrecognized tribes. Language According to San Diego State University, the Yokutsan languages are members of the Penutian language family.

Trading routes  The Yokuts tribe of California are known to have engaged in trading with other California tribes of Native Americans in the United States including coastal peoples like, for example, the Chumash tribe of the Central California coast, and they are known to have traded plant and animal products. Internal conflicts within the Chukchansi tribe near Yosemite On 5 April 2015 (4-5-2015), it was reported that members of the Chukchansi tribe near Yosemite have been disenrolling other members from the tribe for decades, so that the tribe's casino profits go to fewer people. In the autumn of 2014, several disenrolled Chukchansi tribe members (who were no longer receiving a share of casino profits) arrived at the Chukchansi Gold Resort & Casino armed with guns, and violence ensued. As a result, a federal judge ordered that the casino be shut down.

The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100. Details are included in the civil parish of Sproxton, North Yorkshire. The inner court of the monastery contained buildings such as the brewhouse, bakehouse and guesthouse. Its name originated as Rye (the river) + Norman-French val or valle = \\"valley\\". Its old local pronunciation was as \\"Rivers\\", and changed to \\"Reevo\\" when education brought a general familiarity with the French language. St Mary the Virgin The abbey was closed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII in 1538 and the grounds were bought by the Earl of Rutland. He was keen to continue the iron-smelting industry which had been conducted by the monks. He therefore established a charcoal-fired blast furnace and the associated structures and workings in what became Rievaulx village. This continued until its disruption during the Civil War, with production ceasing in 1647. The village then became agricultural in nature and remains as a small settlement, situated below the Abbey and the Rievaulx Terrace & Temples. The old watermill has been converted into a house around the workings, many of which are still extant, including the mill wheel, though the mill has been out of operation for a long time. The miller's cottage also still stands and is a separate abode. Almost all of the other buildings in the village are built with stones from the ruins of the Abbey. The only buildings built with materials from other sources are the buildings constructed after 1917, following the conservation of the Abbey. When he was raised to the House of Lords in 1983, former prime minister Harold Wilson took the title Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, but chose to pronounce it Rivers (see above).

The Videssos novels *The Videssos cycle The Misplaced Legion (1987) An Emperor for the Legion (1987) The Legion of Videssos (1987) Swords of the Legion (1987) *The Tale of Krispos Series Krispos Rising (1991) Krispos of Videssos (1991) Krispos the Emperor (1994) *The Time of Troubles Series The Stolen Throne (1995) Hammer and Anvil (1996) The Thousand Cities (1997) Videssos Besieged (1998) *The Bridge of the Separator (2005) Background \\"Videssos\\" can mean either the Empire of Videssos, or its capital city. The Videssian Empire is very similar to the Byzantine Empire, and much of its history and geography is analogous to Byzantine history. The main differences are the religion, the existence of magic as a usable force, and some details of the history of surrounding states. These states strongly resemble neighbours of Byzantine Empire - for instance Makuran is Sassanid Persia and Vaspurakan is Armenia (Vaspurakan is in reality a historic Armenian province). The map shown of the known world in the time of the various Videssos stories is a very loose east-for-west flip-flop of the Mediterranean. Like Byzantium, Videssos is an absolute monarchy, ruled by an Emperor. The Emperor is assisted by a numerous, influential bureaucracy. The bureaucracy and military are traditionally rivals for power and influence. Even Videssian offices and titles are the same as the Byzantine ones (e.g. autokrator, sebastokrator, vestiarios, drungarios). The Videssian emperors and their history strongly resemble the Byzantine emperors. *Genesios is the usurper Phocas. *Maniakes, the main protagonist of the Time of Troubles series is Emperor Heraclius, and the name recalls the famed general George Maniakes. *Anthimos III, the dissolute emperor, is Michael III the Drunkard. *Krispos, of the Tale of Krispos series, is Basil I, with elements of John I Tzimiskes and Basil II. *Mavrikios Gavras, of the original Videssos Cycle, resembles Romanos IV Diogenes, and the two rival imperial families, the Gavras and the Sphrantzes, are analogous to the Komnenos and the Doukas dynasties. The Videssian Empire is rather feudal, with powerful landowners wielding great influence. The class of yeoman farmers, who provided much of the best recruits for the military, is dwindling, analogously to what happened at several stages of Byzantine history. Religion Everything within Videssian life centers around religious beliefs. There are varied types of beliefs from pantheons of gods, spirit/demon worship, and dualist belief. The most widespread belief is in the dualist faith of Phos, the god of light, and Skotos, the dark god. The core of this faith is that Phos and Skotos will battle and only one will emerge. Even in this belief there is nuanced variations that lead to enmity between different countries. *Empire of Videssos and the Kingdom of Agder - Believe that in the end Phos will be victorious. Slang \\"Cocksures.\\" This is the original, orthodox, belief. Videssian religion is dualist, with a good god, Phos (Greek for light) and his evil counterpart, Skotos (Greek for darkness). In some ways, this religion is very similar to Orthodox Christianity, with nearly identical organization, veneration of icons and saints. In other ways, it resembles Zoroastrianism, in particular with its belief in a narrow bridge walked by all souls upon death; the wicked tumble off, unbalanced by their sins, to Skotos' icy hell, while the souls of the virtuous make it across. *Duchy of Namdalen - the fight between the two gods is balanced, but you should stake your soul on the favorable outcome of Phos. Slang \\"Gamblers.\\" *Thatagush, Khatrish, and Kubrat - the fight between the two gods is perfectly balanced and what you believe or do makes no difference. Slang \\"Balancers\\". *Vaspurakan - believe that they and their land was founded by Vaspur, son of Phos. Slang \\"Princes.\\" Vaspurakan is not a proper country, lying in between the Empire of Videssos and Yezd. It has been torn claimed by both sides at numerous times. *Yezd - Skotos will emerge victorious. Yezd is the resulting country from a nomad invasion of the Makuran Empire by nomadic Yezda led by Avshar, high priest of Skotos. *Makuran - The former Makuran Empire had followed a monotheistic religion which venerated a creator deity known simply as \\"The God\\", represented on earth by the Four Prophets. Many Makurani still follow the Four Prophets secretly. *Haloga - Believe in a pantheon of gods roughly analogous to the Norse deities of the real world Vikings. Though heathen, they are afforded a degree of grudging respect by the mostly intolerant residents of the Empire of Videssos. They are mostly accepting of the Halogai's beliefs, believing that at the very least their worship practices instill in them a sense of courage and justice, though many Videssians still believe the Halogai to be damned to the inevitable fate of all heathens and non-believers. *Kamorth nomads of Pardrya and Arshaum nomads of Shaumkhiil - spirit/demon worship. The basic prayer of those who follow Phos is \\"We bless thee, Phos, Lord with the right and good mind, by thy grace our protector, watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor.\\" To this those of the Duchy of Namdalen append \\"On this we stake our very souls.\\" It is postulated by Gorgidas in the Videssos Cycle that the variants of the Phos beliefs have to do with political and ethnic reasons rather than true belief. He states that the Vaspurakanur belief in their direct descent from Phos was a way to separate themselves from Videssos and maintain a separate social structure. The Balancer beliefs are flat out stated to have come out of the barbarian invasions of areas of the Empire. Those who survived these centuries of attacks were no longer certain of the inevitable victory of Phos. There are no noted variations of the followers of Skotos.

It is known in Louisiana as the \\"Cajun Prairie\\", Texas as \\"Coastal Prairie,\\" and as the Tamaulipan pastizal in Mexico. Setting Williams Prairie, a 10-acre (40,000 m2) remnant prairie preserve west of Houston in Waller County, Texas, USAThe ecoregion covers an area of , extending along the shore of the Gulf of Mexico from southeastern Louisiana (west of the Mississippi Delta) through Texas and into the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as far as the Laguna Madre. Specific areas include a number of barrier islands, and the resacas or natural levees of the Laguna Madre. The coast is vulnerable to tropical storms that can seriously damage habitats. This ecosystem is edaphic in origin; the soils in this region are of a heavy clay that contributed to difficulty for woody species to establish, allowing grasses and herbaceous species to be more competitive.http://gulfcoast.harc.edu/Biodiversity/PrairieHabitat/CoastalPrairie/tabid/2285/Default.aspxThe region name, though, is a bit of a misnomer. It is not a wide open, treeless prairie; instead, the grassy areas are broken up by many pockets/groves of forest, usually along water courses, or isolated silt/sand pockets among the substrate (where the soil is more permissive for tree growth).https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/hunter-education/online- course/wildlife-conservation/texas-ecoregions Climate From Louisiana west to the Upper Texas coast, the climate of the region is wet humid subtropical, featuring high annual rainfall. The climate becomes more arid going down the Texas coast, and into Northeastern Mexico, though precipitation totals still remain high enough for humid subtropical classification. Flora The natural habitat of the area is a mix of tallgrass prairie similar to those found in inland Texas, with Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) the primary tallgrass species that are typical of the coastal prairie, with several other shorter grasses and many herbaceous and woody species. In addition, the region has bottomland forests lining the floodplains of the many waterways in the region. In the wetter regions along the upper Texas coast and Louisiana, the tree species include many of those seen in forest of the Southern United States, such as the southern live oak, bald cypress, magnolia, loblolly pine, post oak, and southern hackberry. The southern third of the Texas stretch and all of the Tamaulipan portion contains shrubby areas of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), huisache (Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana), lime prickly-ash (Zanthoxylum fagara), and Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana). Fauna This coast is rich in wildlife, and 700 species of birds, animals and reptiles have been counted here, although many are now threatened or endangered. This coast is a critical habitat for the Attwater's prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri), over one million of which inhabited the prairie in Texas and Louisiana in the 19th century, but extreme reduction of their habitat put them on the U.S. endangered species list in 1967. Another endangered bird of the coast is the whooping crane (Grus americana). Many species of wading birds, shorebirds, and other waterbirds are abundant. Birds in the Mexican part of the region include Morelet‚Äôs seedeater (Sporophila morelleti), red-billed pigeon (Columba flavirostris), brown jay (Cyanocorax morio), Neotropic cormorant, white-winged dove (Leptotila verrequxi) and Audubon's oriole (Icterus graduacauda). Mammals of the area include bobcats, collared peccary, white-tailed deer, eastern cottontails, with ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), Gulf Coast jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi cacomitli), southern yellow bat (Lasiurus ega), and Mexican spiny pocket mouse (Liomys irroratus) more abundant in Mexico. Rancho Nuevo beach in Tamaulipas and along the Texas coast are the only nesting sites in the world for the Kemp's ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) while other herpetofauna of the southern part of the ecoregion include R√≠o Grande chirping frog (Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides) and Mexican white-lipped frog (Leptodactylus fragilis). Threats and preservation Less than 1% of the ecoregion remains in pristine condition, almost entirely in Texas, while most of the coast has been converted to farmland, including rice paddies, grazing land, or urban areas including Houston, Texas. Estuaries and other coastal wetlands are better preserved than the prairie and indeed the protected areas of the coast are mainly sanctuaries for waterbirds.

Phuture consisted of Nathan Pierre Jones, better known as DJ Pierre and Earl Smith Jr. (known as \\"Spanky\\") and Herbert Jackson. Jones had been interested in developing dance music and became superficially interested in house music after Spanky had taken him to see DJ Ron Trent perform in Chicago. The trio began developing tracks without finding anything that they felt was satisifying, Jones had heard a track made on the unpopular Roland TB-303 bass machine, which led the group purchasing one. In 1985, the group developed a track initially known as \\"In Your Mind\\", which they gave to Ron Trent to listen to. Trent agreed to play it at the Music Box. The audience was not at first receptive but over the course of the night, on the fourth went over very well. \\"Acid Tracks\\" was bootlegged as \\"Ron Trent's Acid Track\\" leading to Phuture to seek out a way to release it on vinyl. The group connected with Marshall Jefferson, the working for Trax Records and who released the popular house music song \\"Move Your Body\\". Jefferson assisted with the recording by slowing down the beats per minute and suggesting a vocal change on the b-side \\"Your Only Friend\\". Following its release in 1987 its popularity expanded outside Chicago, and it became a foundational Acid House track in the United Kingdom. Development =Background= \\"Acid Tracks\\" was developed through experimentation on the Roland TB-303 Nathan Pierre Jones, better known as DJ Pierre, grew up in a musical family in Chicago suburb of University Park. He played drums and clarinet in school bands before getting into DJing and scratch mixing. Pierre became interested in music through DJing and mixing by listening to the Hot Mix 5 radio show, specifically the episodes hosted by Farley \\"Jackmaster\\" Funk. Jones mainly was predominantly making break-dancing music but changed styles after Spanky took him to a club called the Music Box where DJ Ron Hardy performed. Jones described it as being \\"baptized into real house music by going there, I'd never seen anyone yell for a DJ before Ron Hardy. I mean, they were screaming his name. People were so passionate that they would start crying.‚Äù As Phuture, Jones, Earl Smith Jr. (known as \\"Spanky\\") and Herbert Jackson began to experiment but were not satisfied with any of the basslines they developed. Jones heard a friends track and was inspired by his bassline he created, and discovered that it had been developed using a Roland TB-303, a drum machine designed to provide an automatic bass accompaniment for solo guitarists. Jones recalled that Spanky had found the TB-303 at a second-hand shop for about $40 while Spanky recollected that he his initial search for the machine had no result until he found it second hand for $200 which he \\"spend [his] last dime on.\\" Following the purchase of the equipment, the group began experimenting on their first tracks. =Production= Herb and Spanky worked on the track from late 1985, using the 303 to create a bleeping noise which then led to Jones to start \\"turning the knobs up and tweaking it just like [Herb and Spanky] were.\\" Spanky recollected that the group was pressing a button that was supposed to sound like a live bass guitar, but the imitation was poor and afterwards \\"began pushing buttons [he] didn't understand.\\" Encouraged by his bandmates, Jones kept experimenting with the sound. When experimenting with the machine, Jones recalled that he \\"wanted to make something that sounded like things I'd hear in the Music Box, or I heard Farley play on the radio\\" and that \\"when we made \\"Acid Tracks\\", that was an accident. It was just ignorance, basically. Now knowing how to work the damn 303.\\" The group sought a sound which Chicago DJs in might use as an opening track. They took a cassette tape of the recording to the Music Box for Ron Hardy to play. They waited outside the club for two hours before giving it to him, believing that \\"he was the man. If he said he loved something, that was it. But if Ron Hardy had said he didn't like it, that would have been the end of acid.\\" According to Jones, Hardy listened to the entire 30 minutes without and saying anything. Jones recalled that they \\"were worried, because he didn‚Äôt give us any indication that he liked it... and so we were just quiet. When it faded out he looked over at us and said, \\"When can I get a copy?\\"\\" Jones recalled that when \\"Acid Tracks\\" was first played by Hardy, everyone left the dance floor, leaving them to think \\"ok I guess he won't be ever playin' that ever again.\\" He later played the song a number of times that night getting an increasingly better each time, and by the fourth, play around 4am, the audience was ecstatic. Jones recalled that \\"People were dancing upside down. This guy was on his back, kicking his legs in the air. It was like, \\"wow!\\"\\" When originally conceived, the track was titled \\"In Your Mind\\". The track began regularly played in Hardy‚Äôs DJ sets with fans resorting to bootlegging it on microcassette recorders. These fans began calling the track \\"Ron Hardy's Acid Track,\\" leading to the tracks title change. On the new title, Jones recollected that he was \\"very innocent\\" and was unfamiliar with the drug acid, recalling that \\"sometimes things will go right over my head. I was like, acid makes a gritty sound. Like you know, you have battery acid, you‚Äôd always see the sign ‚Äúacid‚Äù and then they show somebody pouring something out of a tube onto metal and be melting it. And I thought, okay, this thing is gritty. It‚Äôs like acidic! It‚Äôs a tough sound! So that‚Äôs what I thought. \\" The relationship with the song and drug culture led to the group developing the track \\"Your Only Friend\\", a song with anti-drug lyrics which Jones recalled \\"didn‚Äôt even get across like that, people literally, in Chicago, would go get their drugs when that song came on. And I was thinking, Oh crap, you guys, I‚Äôm trying to tell you something.\\" Re-recording and release Unsure as to how to promote the track, Phuture approached Marshall Jefferson, a house music producer already known for the tracks such as \\"Move Your Body\\". Marshall Jefferson was performing \\"Move Your Body\\" at the Power House in Chicago. Pierre recalled that he wrote a note stating \\"My name is DJ Pierre. I'm in a group called Phuture, and we did a track called \\"Acid Tracks\\", and Ron Hardy has been playing this track off a reel. Could you help up make a record?\\" The group was in front of a stage where Marshall was performing \\"Move Your Body\\" trying to pass him the note. House producer Curtis McClain eventually took the note and passed it on to Jefferson. Jefferson had recently taken over A&R; at Trax Records following Vince Lawrence departure, and agreed to mix the track, suggesting them to slow it from the original c. 130 beats per minute to about 120 bpm. Although the group initially resisted, Jefferson reassured then that if a DJ wanted to play it faster, they could speed up the record. Jones slowed it to 120 bpm and later claimed that Jefferson's contributions were limited to \\"setting levels and stuff. But as far as producing, he didn‚Äôt add any new sounds to it or anything like that.\\" Marshall also suggested changes to the track \\"Your Only Friend\\" having Spanky do the vocals instead of Jones and added harmonizer to make the voice deeper. Jefferson recollected on the recording stating that he \\"I sat in the studio and watched them\\" and that he Larry Sherman of Trax did not want to put the record out unless [Jefferson] produced it. Since I recommended the project, I wanted to make sure it got taken care of.\\" \\"Acid Tracks\\" was released in 1987. Spanky said the group's name came when Tyrone was sitting with them in a restaurant and suggested the name \\"Future\\". The band were each paid $1500 from Trax but were unaware of the track's popularity outside the Chicago area. Looking back, Jones says that the deal \\"kick-started our careers, so I never look back and complain. I state the fact that Trax is the most crooked label on the planet. But good came of it. Phuture was born, and DJ Pierre was here to stay.\\" \\"Acid Trax\\" was followed up with the single \\"We Are Phuture\\" in 1988. Reception and legacy Especially in the UK, \\"Acid Tracks\\" became a pioneering song for the acid house movement, and the acid style became known for the distinctive sound created on the Roland TB-303 Bass Synthesizer. Following the release of \\"Acid Tracks\\", countless similar tracks were released. The tune became popular in British clubs such as London's Shoom and the Hacienda in Manchester. By 1988, the British music press were describing the emerging rave scene as driven by acid house music. Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, authors of Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, wrote that this scene however had many listeners \\"ignorant of any distinctions\\", leading to acid house becoming a shorthand for any house music and techno tracks becoming a blanket term in Britain for new electronic dance music. Matt Black, British DJ of Coldcut described tracks such as \\"Acid Tracks\\" and Derrick May's \\"Nude Photo\\" having \\"a phenomenal impact\\" and that \\"even straight away you realised that here was a new form of energy that has materialised.\\" British DJ Dave Dorrell recalled that \\"Acid Tracks\\" and Armando's \\"Frequency\\" and \\"Land of Confusion\\" were the first acid house records he got his hands on stating that \\"acid house was so far out there that it was beyond anything. There were no direction signs.\\" Later reception included author Micah Salkind, saying that \\"Acid Tracks\\" became \\"One of Trax Records's most iconic releases\\", while John Bush of AllMusic gave the song a four and a half star rating out of five, describing it as an \\"incredibly raw cut [...] Still, the superb acid squelch, ripe for the picking by DJs across the world, continued to impress long after the first hundred or so \\"covers\\" and answer records flooded the dance racks.\\" Track listing 12\\" single (TX142) # \\"Acid Tracks\\" # \\"Phuture Jacks\\" # \\"Your Only Friend\\" Credits Credits adapted from the singles label sticker. * Marshall Jefferson producer, mixing * DJ Pierre writer * Spanky writer (on \\"Acid Tracks\\" and \\"Phuture Jacks\\") * Herbert J writer (on \\"Acid Tracks\\" and \\"Phuture Jacks\\") References =Footnotes= =Sources=    * Category:1987 debut singles Category:Phuture songs Category:Trax Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Marshall Jefferson ","title":"Acid Tracks"},{"id":"2625624","text":"Underground stage of the Tour de l'Abitibi The Cit√© de l'Or (\\"The City of Gold\\") is an attraction located in Val-d'Or, in the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region of Quebec, Canada.

It was the replacement for the FG. The F-301 was identical to the Nikon F-501 (sold in North America as the N2020) in almost every way, except it lacked autofocus. The Nikon F-301 is notable for being the first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a film advance lever. As a result the selector knob, also used to lock the shutter button, has a continuous option in addition to the single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding. A standard hotshoe flash mount sits above the viewfinder, with which a flash may be attached to the camera. The Nikon F-301 does not feature a built-in pop-up flash (the F-401 was the first Nikon SLR to have this feature). It was also the first Nikon to use polycarbonates in the building of the camera, and was considered by many people as the dawn of a new era for Nikon. This camera is powered by four AAA batteries, loaded from below, necessitating removal of the baseplate. A MB-3 battery pack could be used instead of the standard MB-4 enabling AA batteries to be used instead of AAA. The placement of the batteries meant that the tripod bush on the baseplate was extremely offset from the centre of the camera. The AH-3 tripod adapter could be used to rectify this though it added extra bulk to the camera. The F-301 can be manually preset for film speeds from ISO 12 to ISO 3200, or this can be left to the camera through the DX feature. The camera can also be used with the Nikon SB-600 & SB-800 flash units.

The word is also a short form of the (unrelated) name for the National Sports Festival of Japan. Etymology Kokutai originated as a Sino-Japanese loanword from Chinese guoti (; \\"state political system; national governmental structure\\"). The Japanese compound word joins and . According to the Hanyu Da Cidian, the oldest guoti usages are in two Chinese classic texts. The 2nd century BCE Guliang zhuan () to the Spring and Autumn Annals glosses dafu () as guoti metaphorically meaning \\"embodiment of the country\\". The 1st century CE Book of Han history of Emperor Cheng of Han used guoti to mean \\"laws and governance\\" of Confucianist officials. Pre-1868 The historical origins of kokutai go back to pre-1868 periods, especially the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate (1603‚Äì1868). Aizawa Seishisai (‰ºöÊ≤¢Ê≠£ÂøóÊñé, 1782‚Äì1863) was an authority on Neo-Confucianism and leader of the Mitogaku (Ê∞¥Êà∏Â≠¶ \\"Mito School\\") that supported direct restoration of the Imperial House of Japan. He popularized the word kokutai in his 1825 Shinron (Êñ∞Ë´ñ \\"New Theses\\"), which also introduced the term Sonn≈ç j≈çi (\\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\\"). Aizawa developed his ideas of kokutai using the scholarly arguments of Motoori Norinaga (1730‚Äì1801) that the Japanese national myths in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki were historical facts, believing that the Emperor was directly descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu-≈çmikami. Aizawa idealized this divinely-ruled ancient Japan as a form of saisei itchi (Á•≠Êîø‰∏ÄËá¥ \\"unity of religion and government\\") or theocracy. For early Japanese Neo-Confucian scholars, linguist Roy Andrew Miller (1982:93) says, \\"kokutai meant something still rather vague and ill defined. It was more or less the Japanese \\"nation's body\\" or \\"national structure\\". From 1868 to 1945 =From 1868 to 1890= Kat≈ç Hiroyuki (1836‚Äì1916) and Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835‚Äì1901) were Meiji period scholars who analyzed the dominance of Western civilization and urged progress for the Japanese nation. In 1874, Kat≈ç wrote the Kokutai Shinron (ÂõΩ‰ΩìÊñ∞Ë´ñ \\"New Theory of the National Body/Structure\\"), which criticized traditional Chinese and Japanese theories of government and, adopting Western theories of natural rights, proposed a constitutional monarchy for Japan. He contrasted between kokutai and seitai (Êîø‰Ωì \\"government body/structure\\"). Brownlee explains. > The Kokutai-seitai distinction enabled conservatives to identify clearly as > Kokutai, National Essence, the \\"native Japanese\\", eternal, and immutable > aspects of their polity, derived from history, tradition, and custom, and > focused on the Emperor. The form of government, Seitai, a secondary concept, > then consisted of the historical arrangements for the exercise of political > authority. Seitai, the form of government, was historically contingent and > changed through time. Japan had experienced in succession direct rule by the > Emperors in ancient times, then the rule of the Fujiwara Regents, then seven > hundred years of rule by sh≈çguns, followed by the allegedly direct rule of > the Emperors again after the Meiji Restoration. Each was a seitai, a form of > government. In this understanding, the modern system of government under the > Meiji Constitution, derived this time from foreign sources, was nothing more > than another form of Japanese government, a new seitai. The Constitution was > nothing fundamental. (2000:5) Fukuzawa Yukichi was an influential author translator for the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860). His 1875 \\"Bunmeiron no Gairyaku\\" (ÊñáÊòéË´ñ„ÅÆÊ¶ÇÁï• \\"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization\\") contradicted traditional ideas about kokutai. He reasoned that it was not unique to Japan and that every nation could be said to have a kokutai \\"national sovereignty\\". While Fukuzawa respected the Emperor of Japan, he believed kokutai did not depend upon myths of unbroken descent from Amaterasu. =Meiji Constitution= The Constitution of the Empire of Japan of 1889 created a form of constitutional monarchy with the kokutai sovereign emperor and seitai organs of government. Article 4 declares that \\"the Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty\\", uniting the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, although subject to the \\"consent of the Imperial Diet\\". This system utilized a democratic form, but in practice was closer to an absolute monarchy. The legal scholar Josefa L√≥pez notes that under the Meiji Constitution, kokutai acquired an additional meaning. > The Government created a whole perfect new cultural system around the Tennou > [Emperor], and the kokutai was the expression of it. Moreover, the kokutai > was the basis of the sovereignty. According to Tatsukichi Minobe, kokutai is > understood as the \\"shape of the Estate\\" in the sense of \\"Tenno as the organ > of the Estate\\", while the authoritarians gave the kokutai a mystical power. > The Tennou was a \\"god\\" among \\"humans\\", the incarnation of the national > morals. This notion of kokutai was extra-juridical, more something cultural > than positive. (2006:n.p.) This stemmed from It≈ç Hirobumi's rejection of some European notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity.W. G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan, p 79-80 The references to the kokutai were the justification of the emperor's authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign. The \\"family-state\\" element in it was given a great deal of prominence by political philosophy.W. G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan, p 80 Many conservatives supported these principles as central to Nihon shugi (Nihon gunkoku shugi, Japanese militarism), \\"Japanism\\", as an alternative to rapid Westernization. =Taish≈ç Democracy= From the Xinhai Revolution to the enactment of the Peace Preservation Law (1911‚Äì1925), the most important pre-World War II democracy movement \\"Taish≈ç Democracy\\" occurred. During the Taish≈ç Democracy, the political theorist Sakuz≈ç Yoshino (1878‚Äì1933) rejected Western democracy minshu shugi (Ê∞ë‰∏ª‰∏ªÁæ© lit. \\"people rule principle/-ism\\") and proposed a compromise on imperial democracy minpon shugi (Ê∞ëÊú¨‰∏ªÁæ© \\"people based principle/-ism\\"). However, as Japanese nationalism grew, questions arose whether the kokutai emperor could be limited by the seitai government. The Peace Preservation Law of 1925 forbade both forming and belonging to any organization that proposed altering the kokutai or the abolishment of private property, effectively criminalizing socialism, communism, republicanism, democracy and other anti-Tenno ideologies. The Tokk≈ç (\\"Special Higher Police\\") was established as a type of Thought Police to investigate political groups that might threaten Tenno-centered social order of Japan.W. G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan, p 184 =Under the Public Safety Preservation Law= Tatsukichi Minobe (1873‚Äì1948), a professor emeritus of law at Tokyo Imperial University, theorized that under the Meiji Constitution, the emperor was an organ of the state and not a sacrosanct power beyond the state.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p198-9, , This was regarded as l√®se-majest√©. Minobe was appointed to the House of Peers in 1932 but forced to resign after an assassination attempt and vehement criticisms that he was disloyal to the emperor.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p199, , Great efforts were made to foment a \\"Japanese spirit\\" even in popular culture, as in the promotion of the \\"Song of Young Japan.\\"Piers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s, p441 > Brave warriors united in justice In spirit a match for a million ‚Äì Ready > like the myriad cherry blossoms to scatter In the spring sky of the Sh≈çwa > Restoration. The national debates over kokutai led the Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe to appoint a committee of Japan's leading professors to deliberate the matter. In 1937, they issued the Kokutai no Hongi (ÂõΩ‰Ωì„ÅÆÊú¨Áæ©, \\"Cardinal Principles of the National Body/Structure,\\" see Gauntlett and Hall 1949). Miller gives this description. > The document known as the Kokutai no Hongi was actually a pamphlet of 156 > pages, an official publication of the Japanese Ministry of Education, first > issued in March 1937 and eventually circulated in millions of copies > throughout the home islands and the empire. It contained the official > teaching of the Japanese state on every aspect of domestic policy, > international affairs, culture, and civilization. (1982:92) It clearly stated its purpose: to overcome social unrest and to develop a new Japan. From this pamphlet, pupils were taught to put the nation before the self, and that they were part of the state and not separate from it.W. G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan, p 187 It also instructed them in the principle of hakk≈ç ichiu, which would be used to justify imperialism. Brownlee concludes that after the Kokutai no Hongi proclamation, > It is clear that at this stage in history, they were no longer dealing with > a concept to generate spiritual unity like Aizawa Seishisai in 1825, or with > a political theory of Japan designed to accommodate modern institutions of > government, like the Meiji Constitution. The committee of professors from > prestigious universities sought to define the essential truths of Japan, > which might be termed religious, or even metaphysical, because they required > faith at the expense of logic and reason. (2006:13) The Ministry of Education promulgated it throughout the school system. By 1937, \\"election purification\\", originally aimed at corruption, required that no candidate set the people in opposition to either the military or the bureaucracy.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p196, , This was required because voters were required to support imperial rule. Some objections to the founding of the Taisei Yokusankai or Imperial Rule Assistance Association, came on the grounds that kokutai already required all imperial subjects to support imperial rule. Conservative thinkers voiced concerns that the establishment of an empowered class of aides to the emperor was akin to the creation of a new shogunate. For the leaders of Japan's \\"fascist-nationalist clique\\", writes Miller (1982:93), \\"kokutai had become a convenient term for indicating all the ways in which they believed that the Japanese nation, as a political as well as a racial entity, was simultaneously different from and superior to all other nations on earth.\\" This term, and what it meant, were widely inculcated in propaganda.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p246 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York The final letters of kamikaze pilots expressed, above all, that their motivations were gratitude to Japan and to its Emperor as the embodiment of kokutai.Ivan Morris, The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan, p309 Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975 A sailor might give his life to save the picture of the Emperor on a submarine.Masanori Ito, The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy p28 New York W.W. Norton & Company 1956 During World War II, intellectuals at an \\"overcoming modernity\\" conference proclaimed that prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been a classless society under a benevolent emperor, but the restoration had plunged the nation into Western materialism (an argument that ignored commercialism and ribald culture in the Tokugawa era), which had caused people to forget their nature, which the war would enable them to reclaim.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p219-20, , \\"Japanist\\" unions endeavoured to win support by disavowing violence and pledging support for nation and emperor. Nevertheless, because of the mistrust of unions in such unity, the Japanese went to replace them with \\"councils\\" in every factory, containing both management and worker representatives to contain conflict.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p195-6, , Like the Nazi councils they were copying, this was part of a program to create a classless national unity. Because many religions had figures that distracted from the central emperor, they were attacked, such as the Oomoto sect condemned for worshipping figures other than Amaterasu, and in 1939, the Religious Organization authorized the shutting down of any religion that did not conform to the Imperial Way, which the authorities promptly used. Hirohito evoked the Kokutai in the Jewel Voice Broadcast, which announced the Japanese acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration (unconditional surrender). Post-1945 By the surrender of Japan in 1945, the significance of kokutai diminished. In autumn 1945, GHQ forbade circulation of the Kokutai no Hongi and repealed the Peace Preservation Law (15 October 1945). By enact of the Constitution of the State of Japan (3 May 1947), Tenno's sovereignty and the l√®se-majest√© were repealed. Nevertheless, some authors, including Miller (1982:95), believe that traces of Japanese kokutai \\"are quite as vivid today as they ever were\\". In the 21st century, Japanese nationalists, such as those affiliated with the Nippon Kaigi lobby, have begun using the phrase \\"kunigara\\" (ÂõΩÊüÑ).

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 6 May 2006. Written by Steven Moffat and directed by Euros Lyn, the episode is inspired by Audrey Niffenegger's novel The Time-Traveler's Wife. The episode is set in France throughout the 18th century. In the episode, repair androids from a spaceship from the 51st century create time windows to stalk Madame de Pompadour (Sophia Myles) throughout her life. They seek to remove her brain as a replacement part for their spaceship at a point in her life as they believe her to be compatible with the ship. The programme's executive producer Russell T Davies, who conceived the idea while researching for Casanova, described the episode as a love story for the show's protagonist the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). The episode was filmed in England and Wales in October 2005. It was well received by most critics, was nominated for a Nebula Award and won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.  Plot  The Tenth Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore a derelict spaceship in the 51st century. The Doctor looks through a time window, a doorway to another place in space and time, which is shaped like a French fireplace. He sees a young girl called Reinette on the other side of the fireplace who is in 18th-century Paris. The Doctor steps through the time window to find that months have passed. He discovers a clockwork service android disguised in 18th-century clothing hiding in Reinette's bedroom, and saves Reinette from it. The Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a time window; he names it Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. Reinette and the Doctor kiss before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor realises Reinette is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV. Several additional time windows are on the ship which lead to different moments in Reinette's life. The Doctor steps through one window to defend Reinette from an android. The android tells Reinette that the androids killed the ship's crew to use their organs for parts to repair the ship. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball in Versailles and take Reinette hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor cannot enter the time window without being stranded in the 18th century. The androids threaten to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor, on Arthur, crashes through the mirror to save her. With no way of returning to their ship, the androids give up and shut down. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles in the hope that he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is operating and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to Reinette, but finds that seven years have passed for her and she has died. King Louis gives the Doctor a letter in which Reinette hopes for the Doctor's quick return. The Doctor leaves in the TARDIS. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.  Production  Actress Sophia Myles appeared in the episode as Madame de Pompadour. = Writing and characters = In 2004, Russell T DaviesDoctor Whos executive producerwas responsible for Casanova, a serial set in the 18th century. During his research, Davies became fascinated by Madame de Pompadour and wanted to include her in a story which also involved The Turka clockwork man who played chess around the same period and which was later revealed to be a hoax. In early 2005, Steven Moffatwho had written \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" for the serieswas assigned to write the story. Euros Lyn was later assigned to direct it. Sophia Myles stated in an interview on Doctor Who Confidential that she did not have to audition for the role of Madame de Pompadour, she was offered it. In an interview with The Independent, Davies said the episode is \\"practically a love story for the Doctor ... It's very understated, very beautifully done, but it's nonetheless a Time Lord falling in love and Rose's reaction to him falling in love with someone else.\\" Moffat was inspired by Audrey Niffenegger's novel The Time-Traveler's Wife, though the episode's structure is different from that of the novel. During the production, Moffat considered \\"Madame de Pompadour\\", \\"Every Tick of My Heart\\", \\"Reinette and the Lonely Angel\\" and \\"Loose Connection\\" for the episode's title. \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" was planned as the second episode of the 2006 series, however when Davies realised how experimental it had become in Moffat's hands, he decided to move it to fourth in the running order between \\"School Reunion\\" and \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\". The clockwork droids as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience. While Moffat was creating the clockwork automata he first decided to hide their faces with wigs, but when producer Phil Collinson told him this would severely limit camera angles, and that it could appear comical, the androids were given carnival masks to wear. Neill Gorton of Millennium Effects designed the androids and they were constructed by Richard Darwen and Gustav Hoegan. While the episode appears to follow immediately from the previous episode \\"School Reunion\\", Moffat says in the DVD audio commentary that when he wrote \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" he had not yet read the end of \\"School Reunion\\", hence the lack of Rose's continuing animosity shown towards Mickey after he joins the TARDIS crew. After reading the Doctor's mind, Reinette says \\"Doctor who?\\", a reference both to the series' title and to the long-running mystery about the Doctor's actual name. She also says that it is \\"more than just a secret\\", but does not elaborate further. Moffat said that he added the dialogue because he believes that because the Doctor does not tell even his closest companions his name, there must be a \\"dreadful secret\\" about it. Moffat also says that he did not include the word \\"Torchwood\\" (an \\"arc word\\" in the second series) in the script because Davies did not ask him to do so. = Filming = Filming for the episode took place between 12 and 27 October 2005. The scenes set in Versailles were filmed elsewhere; the first scenes filmed in which Reinette's body is taken away from city were filmed at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff, Madame de Pompadour's sitting room and bedroom scenes were filmed at Tredegar Housea 17th-century mansion in Newport, Dyffryn Gardens in the Vale of Glamorgan was used as the set for the palace gardens, and Ragley Hall near Alcester was used for the ballroom scenes. The scenes on the spaceship, which were shot by the second unit, were also filmed in Newport. Two horses were used in the episode; one was used for the scenes in close quarters on the spaceship, and another for jumps. According to Doctor Who Confidential, the horse was not allowed into the ballroom for the climactic scene. Thus, the elements of the Doctor riding through the mirror, the horse, the mirror breaking and the reactions of the extras in the ballroom had to be filmed separately and then composited together with chroma key. Tennant's head was superimposed upon that of the stunt rider in post-production. Initially, the programme's staff considered the use of special effects but realised this would be very expensive and rejected the idea. Broadcast and reception \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 6 May 2006. The final rating for the episode was 7.90 million, making it the thirteenth most watched programme on British television that week. It received an Appreciation Index of 84, considered \\"excellent\\". The episode's script was nominated for the 2006 Nebula Award, and \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Writing for IGN, Ahsan Haque praised Tennant and Myles' acting, the episode's pacing and the \\"extremely touching\\" story. He wrote that \\"with a little more attention to temporal details, this episode would have been considered as one of the series' greatest moments\\". In particular, Haque wrote that the episode would have worked better had the writers explained more precisely why the Doctor could not use the TARDIS to visit Madame de Pompadour before she died. Metro said the clockwork androids were one of the \\"most memorable villains\\" while The Guardians Daniel Martin said, \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" is \\"one of the most acclaimed episodes from the Davies era\\". Ross Ruediger from Slant Magazine wrote that the episode \\"may be the crowning achievement\\" of Doctor Whos second series. Ruediger called it an episode \\"for the new millennium\\" as he thought it \\"could never exist under the banner of the old series.\\" He called it a \\"thought-provoking piece\\", and wrote that episodes like this could not be broadcast every week since it \\"would be too taxing on the average viewer's brain\\". IGN's Matt Wales ranked \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" the third best Tennant Doctor Who story, calling it \\"one of Doctor Whos most touching adventures\\".

Barros was one of the first great Portuguese historians, most famous for his work D√©cadas da √Åsia (Decades of Asia), a history of the Portuguese Empire in India and Asia, published between 1552‚Äì1615. Barros mentions that Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa was the son of a Pedro de Mendon√ßa of Mour√£o, but his date of birth is not given.\\"Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa filho de Pero de Mendo√ßa alcaide m√¥r de Mour√£o\\".

He died there in 1532.Hormuz was ruled by Portugal from 1515 to 1622 under the submission of Goa, then a Portuguese possession, before being incorporated into Persia in 1622. Mendon√ßa is named by Barros as the captain of a ship that left Lisbon in 1519 and, after arriving at Goa, as having been given instructions to search for Pliny's legendary Isles of Gold (Chryse), said to lie to \\"beyond Sumatra\\": > At the end of June of the year 1520, a ship arrived that had departed the > Kingdom that year, the Captain and Pilot being Pedro Eanes, nicknamed the > Frenchman, who being a diligent man and one well versed in matters of the > sea, King Manuel had entrusted with letters for Diogo Lopez concerning > matters of service.

Barros promises to return to the topic of the voyage to the Isles of Gold, and subsequently does so, relating how Mendon√ßa was diverted from the quest by the requirement to assist with the building and defence of a fort at Pedir in the territory of the Sumatran principality of Pacem (Pasai). Mendon√ßa and other Portuguese captains are described as assisting with the construction of a fort at Pedir (Sumatra), after which he proceeded to Malacca: > And there came to the port of Pedir Raphael Catanho and Christov√£o de > Mendo√ßa with his three ships for the discovery of the Isles of Gold‚Ä¶ Antonio > de Brito was still commanding there‚Ä¶ as the construction of the fortress had > taken much time, and Raphael Catanho, Raphael Perstrello, and Christov√£o de > Mendo√ßa had to provision and take on pepper and other things for their > voyages, and also as the monsoon season by which they each had to go, > principally Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa, had already passed, they were all ordered > to stay there to assist and support the fortress, as it was not yet in a > state where it could be defended‚Ä¶ After putting the fort in a good state of > defence, Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa and Dinis Fernandez departed for Malacca.E > sendo tanto avante como o porto de Pedir: achar√£o Raphael Catanho, & > Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa, com os tres navios do seu descobrimento paro as ilhas > do Ouro‚Ä¶ todavia Antonio de Brito ficou com a sua capitania‚Ä¶ Porque como o > acabamento do fortaleza avia mister muito tempo, & Raphael Catanho, Raphael > Perstrello, & Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa ali se avi√£o de prover, & carregar de > pimenta & de outras cousas pera fazerem suas viagems, & tambem o tempo n√£o > era de mon√ß√£o pero onde cadahum avia de ir, principalmente a Christov√£o de > Mendo√ßa, que era j√° passada: mandou a todos que ficassem ali em ajuda & > favor daquella fortaleza, em quanto ella n√£o estava em estado pera se poder > defender‚Ä¶ A qual despois que foi posta em estado que bem se podia defender: > Christov√£o de Mendo√ßa & Dinis Fernandez for√£ose pera Malaca.

As there is no further mention by Barros of the quest by Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa for the Ilhas do Ouro, it is not clear whether he ever carried out this commission, or whether Barros intended to explain why it was not carried out by relating how he was diverted by the defence of Pedir.McIntyre, K.G. (1977) The Secret Discovery of Australia, Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook, p.241-243 Souvenir Press, Menindie Jo√£o de Barros quoted in Trickett, P.(2007) p.79 Barros relates that prior to Mendon√ßa being ordered to discover the Isles of Gold they had already been sought by Diogo Pacheco, whose attempt came to grief on the coast of Sumatra: > Diogo Pacheco came there a little before Manuel Pacheco from Malacca, and > brought great information on the Isles of Gold that were generally known in > India to be to the south of Sumatra.

Pande (ed.), India's Interaction with Southeast Asia, Chapter 6, pp.87-109. Mendon√ßa and the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia In the 1970s, Mendon√ßa's name became well known in Australian history discussions when it was connected to the Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia by Kenneth McIntyre.McIntyre, K.G. (1977) P.239-248 While there are few Portuguese documents or maps beyond Barros that mention Mendon√ßa, and none directly connect Mendon√ßa with Australia, McIntyre hypothesized that in 1521-4 Mendon√ßa captained a fleet of three caravels which charted the east coast of Australia. McIntyre suggested that the voyage was kept secret because it would likely violate the ambiguous Treaty of Tordesillas, under which Portugal agreed that Spain would have exclusive rights to exploration in most of the Americas and the regions between the Americas and Asia (Pacific).McIntyre, K.G. (1977) p.42-51 In addition he argued, many Portuguese records were lost in the disastrous Lisbon earthquake of 1755.However, a significant library of Portuguese discovery maps and documents apparently still exists in Goa. See http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/the-goans-get-tough-and-mystery- remains/2007/04/13/1175971344776.html McIntyre's identification of Mendon√ßa as the likely commander of a Portuguese fleet that charted Australia's east coast c1521-4 has also been accepted by other writers of the Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia, including Lawrence Fitzgerald (1984)Fitzgerald, L (1984). Java La Grande p. 69+. The Publishers, Hobart and Peter Trickett.Trickett, P.(2007) p.11+ McIntyre suggested that one of Mendon√ßa's caravels sailed along the southeast coast of Australia and was wrecked somewhere near Warrnambool, Victoria, becoming the Mahogany Ship of Australian folklore. Although this wreck has not been seen since the 1880s, it is now often described in the Australian media as a Portuguese caravel or one of Mendon√ßa's fleet, largely on the basis of McIntyre's theory.See for example; Adams, D, \\"Buried in the dunes‚Ä¶\\" The Age, March 10, 2000 However, writing in one of his last pieces on the topic in 1994, McIntyre acknowledged that the identity of the Portuguese discoverer remained unclear. \\"Whether the discoverer was Mendon√ßa or some other, at least (I am) certain he was Portuguese.\\"McIntyre, K.G. (1994) Quoted by Peter Schumpeter \\"Great Questions of Our Time Series; Who Discovered Australia?\\" The Age, 26 January 1994 Recent work In his 2007 book Beyond Capricorn, science journalist Peter Trickett revealed other information relating to Mendon√ßa's life, including a fragment of stone engraved with Mendon√ßa's name found in South AfricaTrickett, P. (2007) p.180 Plate 11 and clearly dated 1524, and a drawing that may show the 1519 fleet on its way to Goa.Trickett, P. (2007) p.180 Plate 1 Trickett also connected Mendon√ßa with the discovery of the North Island of New Zealand. Luis Felipe Thomaz, Professor of Oriental Studies at the Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa, Lisbon, contributed a study of the expedition of Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa to the conference, ‚ÄúPortugueses na Austr√°lia‚Äù, held at the Museu da Ci√™ncia, Coimbra, Portugal in May 2008.Luis Felipe Thomaz, \\"A expedi√ß√£o de Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa e o descobrimento da Austr√°lia\\", in Carlota Sim√µes, Francisco Contente Domingues (coordenadores), Portugueses na Austr√°lia: as primeiras viagens, Coimbra,Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra, 2013, pp.59-126, p.98. Other points of view Commenting on McIntyre's theory in 1984, Captain A. ArielAriel, A. \\"Navigating with Kenneth McIntyre\\" in The Great Circle, Vol 6, No 2, 1984. p135-139 suggested it was extremely unlikely any sixteenth century mariner would have taken a voyage southwards down Australia's eastern coast, through uncharted dangerous waters and against prevailing winds, on the assumption Magellan was sailing westwards, in southern latitudes, against the Roaring Forties. Writing in 2006, Associate Professor W.A.R.(Bill) Richardson of Flinders University, South Australia suggested the claim that Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa sailed down the east coast of Australia is sheer speculation, based on voyages about which no real details have survived.Richardson, W.A.R.

The extension of a term is the set of objects that that term denotes. Take the case of Clark Kent, who is secretly Superman. Suppose that Lois Lane fell out of a window and Superman caught her. Thus the statement, \\"Clark Kent caught Lois Lane,\\" is true because it has an extensional context. The names \\"Superman\\" and \\"Clark Kent\\" have the same extension, which is to say that they both refer to the same person, i.e., that superhero who is vulnerable to kryptonite. Anybody that Superman caught, Clark Kent caught. In opposition to extensional contexts are intensional contexts, where synonymous terms cannot be substituted in without potentially compromising the truth-value. Suppose that Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent will investigate a news story with her.

He gained a PhD at Exeter and is published widely. Current themes of research include the use of selected space to enact organised events and the landscape archaeology of defence. Archaeological career Clarke is a visiting tutor in archaeology at the University of Bath, he was educated in archaeology under professor Mick Aston and Julian Richards. Followed by a period at Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford where he obtained his honours degree in post-compulsory education. Clarke held the post of QinetiQ Archaeologist at Boscombe Down between 1996-2008; he returned to the post in July 2013. in September 2017 he joined Wessex Archaeology, the UKs leading archaeological & heritage practice, as Research Manager. His research areas cover a number of periods including Prehistoric and Roman Wiltshire and British Military Architecture of the 20th century (airfields and nuclear), an area where he is considered an authority. He is credited with the discovery of Broad Town Man, a Saxon execution burial from North Wiltshire. In 2017, Clarke was awarded Doctor of Philosophy in Archaeology. His work was supervised by Professor Oliver Creighton and Professor Stephen Rippon. Clarke's thesis, through the University of Exeter, postulated that the archaeology of the Cold War can be utilised in the mapping of human intervention in the landscape. Recognising change from Order to Chaos it is possible to predict the type of material culture that will be encountered on sites connected with highly ordered organisation. Current research is now taking the 'Order and Chaos' model and applying it to a range of situations. Authoring In 2005 Clarke authored Four Minute Warning: Britain's Cold War, published by Tempus that same year. This set the scene for further works including Ten Tons for Tempelhof: The Berlin Airlift in May 2007; publishing the memories of many veterans for the first time along with pictures from private collections. In February 2008 The Archaeology of Airfields was published by The History Press (formally Tempus Publishing). Airfields is the first publication to bring together all periods of military aviation, including the Cold War and discuss them utilising a framework of landscape archaeology. In December 2008 The Jet Provost: A Little Plane With a Big History was released by Amberley Publishing, followed, in October 2009, by The Illustrated Guide to Armageddon. The following October (2010) Remember Scarborough appeared in print, again through Amberley. In a departure from his 20th century research Clarke published Prehistoric Wiltshire: An Illustrated Guide, in collaboration with the Wiltshire Heritage Museum, in September 2011. Current work includes a book on Royal Wootton Bassett (published in May 2013), Devizes and further 20th century related subjects including the construction effort required for war. Aside to the books Clarke has published papers in a number of academic journals on archaeological themes. Subjects range Cold War nuclear bunkers in Wiltshire, Bronze Age metalwork, Roman building techniques, earthworks near Stonehenge and Saxon executions. Editorial output Clarke has held the position of Honorary Review Editor for the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, the Wiltshire County journal, since 2006. In 2011 he was invited onto the Editorial Board of Ex Historia, the post graduate historical journal of the University of Exeter.

The submarine's crew estimated the enemy's bearing, heading, and speed, remaining submerged until out of the enemy's visual range. The submarine then surfaced and proceeded at maximum speed to a position in front of the target, near the target's predicted course but remaining out of view. The submarine would then submerge, approach, and attack. The WWII submarine attack problem The location from which a submarine could attack varied mostly according to the relative top speeds of the attacker and its target. Diesel-electric-powered submarines in the Second World War were typically capable of 18-23 knots on the surface under diesel power and up to 9 knots underwater,Gato-class submarineType VII submarineJapanese submarine I-51 where they were restricted (if lacking a snorkel) to battery power. Battle fleets in World War II might have a top speed of up to 30 knots, making it difficult for submarines to achieve attack position. A convoy of freighters or tankers typically proceeded at up to 10 knots.World War 2: Convoy was the key to defeat of U-boats last time (a 2009 reprint of a 1939 article) Submarines, especially when submerged, were consequently sometimes slower than their prey. Attack opportunities would also be lost if the target detected the submarine and altered course to avoid attack. = Execution = To attack, a sub usually had to get ahead of its target: the end around was one solution to this problem. If a submarine couldn't attack due to unfavorable positioning, its crew would determine the target's course and speed, then calculate a potential torpedo firing point. The end around might then proceed as follows.A two- attack end around maneuver # The submarine attempts an initial attack. If spotted by the target or escorts, the sub then usually submerges. # The submarine moves away from the target (to get out of visual range), then surfaces. # The submarine proceeds at best speed to overtake and pass the target on a parallel course, using the curvature of the Earth, darkness, and weather events (such as rain, snow, and fog) to stay out of the target's view. # After gaining position ahead of the target, the submarine approaches, readies torpedoes and calculates an optimal attack. # The submarine executes the next attack, either while surfaced or submerged. The process can be repeated as long as the sub is able to do so. The end around tactic was useful largely because of submarines' low freeboard, which made them less visible than much-taller merchantmen and warships. Using the targets' upperworks and exhaust smoke to estimate and maintain proper distance, a skilled sub commander could maintain a close watch on enemy ships while keeping his own vessel unseen. = Other considerations = A modification to this tactic incorporated the night surface attack, where the submarine remained surfaced. This variation allowed the submarine to take advantage of its higher surface speed during the actual attack, but increased the likelihood of pre-attack detection, which in turn could result in a counterattack by any escorts, or the targets turning away to spoil the attack. Surface attacks could be executed in daylight or to facilitate an attack using the sub's deck gun, again with added risk. As a defense, ships in wartime can adopt zig-zag sailing patterns rather than practicing more-efficient great-circle navigation. Sailing in zig-zags made computing a target angle more difficult for the submarine crew, especially if the pattern was irregular. Instead of repetitively varying a 90¬∞ base course ten degrees either way (80¬∞, 100¬∞, 80¬∞, 100¬∞), a good commander practices irregular course changes: first 80¬∞, then 110¬∞, 95¬∞, 75¬∞, etc. Irregular zig-zagging obscures the target's base course, making interception harder to calculate and complicating the target solution. On the negative side, zig-zags slow a ship's progress to its destination, allowing the sub to overtake more quickly.

He is currently the head coach at Grand Canyon University. Previously he served as the head coach of the Vanderbilt Commodores and in the same capacity at his alma mater, Valparaiso, having succeeded his father, Homer Drew. Bryce's brother, Scott, also coached at Valpo before becoming the head coach of the Baylor Bears. As a player, Bryce Drew was known for his buzzer-beating shot in the first round of Valparaiso's run in the 1998 NCAA Tournament. He went on to play six seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a backup point guard for the Houston Rockets, Chicago Bulls, Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Hornets. High school career After having been exposed to basketball for years through his father's head coaching position, Bryce played basketball as the point guard for Valparaiso High School in Valparaiso, Indiana. As he progressed through high school though, Drew developed a rapid heartbeat, which required three surgeries to repair. Despite this difficulty, he led his team to the state final game, and was named Indiana's Mr. Basketball of 1994. He was also named the Gatorade Indiana Player of the Year his senior season in high school after guiding his team to a 28‚Äì1 season with the only loss coming in the state finals in overtime to the South Bend Clay High School Colonials.

Drew made a 23-foot 3-point shot, giving him his 22nd point of the night, and clinching the Crusaders' 70‚Äì69 upset and advancing them in the tournament. Drew proceeded to lead the defeat of 12-seeded Florida State 83‚Äì77 in overtime, with a 22-point game. Drew and the Crusaders fell to 8-seeded Rhode Island by a score of 74‚Äì68, with Drew scoring 18 points. Sports Illustrated would rank it the No. 5 sports moment of 1998,Drew drops in and Drew secured his place as a Valparaiso, Indiana, celebrity along with popcorn guru Orville Redenbacher. Professional career Following his rise to fame in the tournament, Drew was selected as Valpo's first ever first round pick as the 16th selection of the 1998 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. After playing with the Rockets for two years, Drew spent one season with the Chicago Bulls, and signed as a free agent for three seasons with the New Orleans Hornets (Charlotte Hornets during his first season with the team). Drew was then waived by the Hornets, and played professionally for the Valencia BC for a year. Coaching career In the summer of 2005, Drew was selected as the new assistant coach of the Valparaiso University men's basketball team. In 2006, Bryce was elevated to the position of associate coach, furthering speculation that he would eventually inherit the head coaching position upon his father's retirement. When Homer Drew retired in May 2011, Bryce Drew was hired as the head coach. Drew was also honored as one of Valparaiso University's 150 Most Influential Persons in the University's history. On April 6, 2016, after five seasons as Valparaiso's coach, Drew was hired by Vanderbilt to be their head coach. In his introductory press conference, he stated, \\"No Vanderbilt team has ever made it to the Final Four, and we would like to be that first Vanderbilt team.\\" The Commodores qualified for the NCAA tournament in his first year coaching at Vanderbilt in 2016-2017, narrowly losing to Northwestern in the first round.https://www.sbnation.com/college- basketball/2017/3/16/14947204/northwestern-vs-vanderbilt-foul-score-2017-ncaa- tournament The team struggled the 2017-18 season, however, posting the first 20-loss season in school history.https://www.anchorofgold.com/2018/3/3/17075554/game-31-vanderbilt- commodores-at-ole-miss-rebels-game-thread Recruiting for the 2018-19 season showed promise as Drew signed 5-stars Darius Garland and Simisola Shittu and 4-star Aaron Nesmith. However, success in recruiting did not translate to success on the court. Garland, the team's starting point guard, was injured during a loss to Kent State, ending his season, and the Commodores went on to lose the final 20 games of its 2018-19 schedule, including going 0-18 in SEC play, becoming the first SEC team in 65 years to go winless in conference play since Georgia Tech went 0-14 in SEC competition in 1953-54. The best showing of the year for Vanderbilt was narrowly losing in overtime to AP #1 Tennessee Volunteers basketball 88-83. On March 22, 2019, Vanderbilt fired Drew. On March 17, 2020, Drew was hired as the head coach of Grand Canyon, replacing Dan Majerle. Broadcasting career After his termination from Vanderbilt, Drew joined ESPN as an analyst for their college basketball coverage. He spent the 2019‚Äì20 season mostly covering conference games between teams from the American Athletic Conference before leaving to take the head coaching job at Grand Canyon. Personal life Drew is the brother-in-law of former University of Toledo and Philadelphia 76ers basketball player, Casey Shaw. Drew's sister Dana is Shaw's wife. Shaw worked as an assistant coach under Drew at Vanderbilt. Drew's wife, formerly Tara Thibodeaux, is a dancer and choreographer. She was a semi-finalist competing at the age of 15 in the V USA IBC International Ballet Competition held in 1994. In 2001 and 2002, she was a member of the Atlanta Hawks NBA dance team. She was awarded the prestigious Outstanding Choreographer Award at the 2017 Youth American Grand Prix in Chicago for her \\"Dying Swan\\" and has set choreography for Ballet Magnificat \\"The Arrival\\" and \\"Stratagem\\". She currently teaches and trains young dancers in Nashville. Tara is the daughter of Kathy Thibodeaux, an American ballet dancer and artistic director, and former child actor and musician Keith Thibodeaux, who portrayed Ricky Ricardo, Jr. (\\"Little Ricky\\") on the TV series I Love Lucy. His brother, Scott Drew, is the basketball coach at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.

He appears in Megadeth's music video for the song \\"Of Mice and Men\\", the Arsenal of Megadeth DVD, and (in cartoon form) the band's cameo in an episode of Duck Dodgers. He never recorded a studio album with Megadeth. On February 10, 2006 James posted a message on the Megadeth forums saying he was parting ways with Megadeth. The forum post MacDonough made was entitled \\"Hello Droogs\\" and contained the following: The next day Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine posted in the forums saying he had nothing bad to say about James and that he hopes they remain friends.

Description A personal chef will meet with a client and customize a meal plan by determining how often the service will be provided and the number of meals cooked each time. The client will typically choose various meals and sides from the chef's menu, then the chef will shop for all groceries, prepare the meal(s) on a designated \\"cook date\\" in the client's home, package the meals for the refrigerator or freezer, clean the kitchen and leave detailed reheating instructions. Some personal chefs also provide the same services for one-time events such as dinner parties, or special events. Many personal chefs also offer personalized cooking instruction in the privacy of the client's home, either one-on-one or in groups. According to health- department guidelines, all food must either be prepared in the home of the client or in a kitchen that has passed an official health inspection. Note that a personal chef is distinct from a private chef, which refers to a chef who is employed exclusively by one client, and in some cases lives in the client's home. When hiring a personal chef to provide either a packaged meal service or to cook for a dinner party, there is usually collaboration between the client and the chef to determine the menu, based on individual tastes and preferences as well as dietary restrictions. An estimate is then provided by the chef. Some chefs charge a fee based on the number of meals and servings prepared each time, and some charge an hourly fee plus the cost of food. Typically, the chef is given approval, a deposit, or (if familiar with the guest/frequent client) an expense account for the menu. The number of personal chef businesses in North America has rose from around 5,000 in 2007 to around 10,000 in 2017. In terms of experience, personal chefs tend to be chefs who have worked in restaurants, hotels, catering or all three, though many culinary students become personal chefs directly out of school. Some personal chefs don't have a culinary background, but are passionate home cooks with years of experience and knowledge. It is not uncommon for some personal chefs ‚Äî particularly those who cook for dinner parties and special occasions ‚Äî to be employed in a restaurant or catering job full-time and work as a personal chef in their spare time for extra income. Potential clients can research personal chefs in their area via online membership registries, or use a personal chef staffing agency. The hiring of a private chef has been popular for some time but was traditionally reserved for the wealthy and was therefore broadly inaccessible to most of the population. However, the rise of private chef companies in Europe has seen the booking of a private chef become a lot more accessible and affordable especially for customers renting self catered properties. It is also now seen in the UK and France as a genuine alternative to eating out.

It is located in the province of East Java and has a and caldera surrounded by a grayish rim. The difference in color of the rim and the flanks of the volcanoes is caused by the rim‚Äôs lack of vegetation compared with the healthy and extensive vegetation on the flanks. Raung, standing almost 3,332 metres (10,932 ft) above sea level, is the tallest volcano of this cluster. Although the valleys between the major volcanoes boast fertile, ash-enriched soil for agriculture, available land is very limited. Raung contains centres constructed along a NE to SW line, with Gunung Suket and Gunung Gadung stratovolcanoes being located to the northeast and west, respectively. Mount Raung can be seen from Lovina Beach, Singaraja, North Bali. The normal route climbing is through Bondowoso and Sumber Wringin. Its earliest recorded eruption was in 1586 which resulted in fatalities; between 1586 and 1817 five more deadly eruptions were recorded.  2015 Eruption  Raung eruption seen from Bali Strait The volcano started to display increased activity on 24 June 2015, and on 29 June 2015 began to eject material causing a dust cloud that resulted in warnings being issued to residents within radius of the caldera, and causing disruption to flights in and out of nearby Bali. According to Landsat images in early July 2015, there is a new lava pool on the mountain, giving the volcano two lava pools, including an older pool. This will likely delay the full eruption of the volcano for a short while. Currently the caldera is still sufficient to keep the lava inside. From July 9, 2015, several airports throughout Indonesia‚Äîincluding on the popular holiday island of Bali and in Surabaya during Idul Fitri‚Äîwere closed due to the ash being produced by the eruptions. The explosive ash emissions stopped during the afternoon of 14 August. It appears likely that the eruption has more or less come to an end.

United Bulgaria ‚Äî a lithograph by Nikolai Pavlovich (1835-1894) The Unification of Bulgaria (, Saedinenie na Balgariya) was the act of unification of the Principality of Bulgaria and the province of Eastern Rumelia in the autumn of 1885. It was co-ordinated by the Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee (BSCRC). Both had been parts of the Ottoman Empire, but the Principality had functioned de facto independently whilst the Rumelian province was autonomous and had an Ottoman presence. The Unification was accomplished after revolts in Eastern Rumelian towns, followed by a coup on supported by the Bulgarian Knyaz Alexander I. The BSCRC, formed by Zahari Stoyanov, began actively popularizing the idea of unification by means of the press and public demonstrations in the spring of 1885.  Background  The 10th Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) ended with the signing of the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano, which cut large territories off the Ottoman Empire. Bulgaria was resurrected after 482 years of foreign rule, albeit as an Principality under Ottoman suzerainty. The Russian diplomats knew that Bulgaria would not remain within these borders for very long ‚Äî the San Stefano peace was called \\"preliminary\\" by the Russians themselves. The Berlin Congress began on and ended on with the Berlin Treaty that created a vassal Bulgarian state in the lands between the Balkans and the Danube. The area between the Balkan Mountains and the Rila and Rhodope Mountains became an autonomous Ottoman province called Eastern Rumelia. The separation of southern Bulgaria into a different administrative region was a guarantee against the fears expressed by Great Britain and Austria-Hungary that Bulgaria would gain access to the Aegean Sea, which logically meant that Russia was getting closer to the Mediterranean. The third large portion of San Stefano Bulgaria ‚Äî Macedonia ‚Äî did not get even this slight taste of liberty, as it remained in the Ottoman borders like it had been before the war.  Organization  Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee In these conditions it was natural that Bulgarians in Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia and Macedonia all strived for unity. The first attempt was made in 1880. The new British prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone (who had strongly supported the Bulgarian cause in the past) made Bulgarian politicians hope that the British policy on the Eastern Question was about to change, and that it will support and look favourably upon an eventual Union. Unfortunately, the change of government did not bring a change in Great Britain's interests. Secondly, there was a possible conflict growing between the Ottoman Empire on one side and Greece and Montenegro on the other. The Union activists from Eastern Rumelia sent Stefan Panaretov, a lecturer in Robert College, to consult the British opinion on the planned Unification. Gladstone's government though, did not accept these plans. Disagreement came from Imperial Russia as well, which was strictly following the decisions taken during the Berlin Congress. Meanwhile, the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire had settled, which finally brought the first Unification attempt to a failure. By mid-1885 most of the active unionists in Eastern Rumelia shared the vision that the preparation of a revolution in Macedonia should be postponed and all efforts should be concentrated on the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. The Bulgarian Knyaz Alexander I was also drawn to this cause. His relations with Russia had worsened to such extent that the Russian Emperor and the pro-Russian circles in Bulgaria openly called for Alexander's abdication . The young knyaz saw that his support for the Unification is his only chance for political survival.  The act of Unification  The Unification was initially scheduled for the middle of September, while the Rumelian militia was mobilized for performing manoeuvres. The plan called for the Unification to be announced on , but on a riot began in Panagyurishte (then in Eastern Rumelia) that was brought under control the same day by the police. The demonstration demanded Unification with Bulgaria. A little later this example was followed in the village of Goliamo Konare. An armed squad was formed there, under the leadership of Prodan Tishkov (mostly known as Chardafon) ‚Äî the local leader of the BSCRC. BSCRC representatives were sent to different towns in the province, where they had to gather groups of rebels and send them to Plovdiv, the capital of Eastern Rumelia, where they were under the command of Major Danail Nikolaev. Telegram from the provisional government in Plovdiv to Knyaz Alexander I proclaiming the Unification of Bulgaria Meanwhile, military manoeuvres were being carried out in the outskirts of Plovdiv. Major Danail Nikolaev, who was in charge of the manoeuvres, was aware of and supported the unionists. On , Rumelian militia (Eastern Rumelia's armed forces) and armed unionist groups entered Plovdiv and took over the Governor's residence. The Governor was Gavril Krastevich, a Bulgarian patriot who, naturally, did not resist the unionists. A temporary government was formed immediately, with Georgi Stranski at its head. Major Danail Nikolaev was appointed commander of armed forces. With help from Russian officers, he created the strategical plan for defence against the expected Ottoman intervention. Mobilization was declared in Eastern Rumelia. As soon as it took power on , the temporary government sent a telegram, asking the knyaz to accept the Unification. On Alexander I answered with a special manifest. On the next day, accompanied by the prime minister Petko Karavelov and the head of Parliament Stefan Stambolov, Knyaz Alexander I entered the capital of the former Eastern Rumelia. This gesture confirmed the unionists' actions as a fait accompli. But the difficulties of the diplomatic and military defence of the Union lay ahead.  International response to the Unification  In the years after the signing of the Berlin Treaty, the St. Petersburg government had often expressed its view that the creation of Eastern Rumelia out of Southern Bulgaria was an unnatural division and would be short-lived. Russia knew that the Unification would undoubtedly come soon and took important measures for its preparation. First, Russia exerted successful diplomatic pressure upon the Ottoman Empire constraining it from sending forces into Eastern Rumelia. Also, in 1881, in a special protocol, created after the re-establishment of the League of the Three Emperors, it was noted that Austria-Hungary and Germany would show support for a possible union act of the Bulgarians. = Russia = Defying most expectations, Russia did not support the September 6 act due to its open conflict with Knyaz Alexander I. Russia wanted to preserve its influence in Bulgarian affairs and feared losing it as the new state grew stronger with Alexander I at its head. As a result, Russia commanded all its officers to leave Bulgaria and suggested that an official conference be held in Constantinople, where the violation of the Berlin status quo was to be sanctioned. = United Kingdom = The government circles in London initially thought that powerful support by St. Petersburg stood behind the bold Bulgarian act. They soon realised the reality of the situation, and after the Russian official position was announced, Great Britain gave its support for the Bulgarian cause, but not until Bulgarian-Ottoman negotiations began. = Austria-Hungary = Austria-Hungary's position was determined by its policy towards Serbia. In a secret treaty from 1881, Austria-Hungary accepted Serbia's \\"right\\" to expand in the direction of Macedonia. Austria-Hungary's aim was to win influence in Serbia, while at the same time directing Serbian territorial appetites towards the south instead of north and north-west. Also, Austria-Hungary had always opposed the creation of a large Slavonic state in the Balkans of the sort that a unified Bulgaria would become. =France and Germany= They supported the Russian proposal of an international conference in the Ottoman capital. = Ottoman Empire = The Balkans after the Unification of Bulgaria After the Unification was already a fact, it took three days for Constantinople to become aware of what had actually happened. A new problem then arose: according to the Berlin treaty the Sultan was only allowed to send troops to Eastern Rumelia at the request of Eastern Rumelia's governor. Gavril Krastevich, the governor at the time, made no such request. At the same time the Ottoman Empire was advised in harsh tone both by London and St. Petersburg not to take any such actions and instead to wait for the decision of the international conference. The Ottomans did not attack Bulgaria, neither intervened in the Serbo-Bulgarian War. On the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria signed the Tophane Agreement, which recognized the Prince of Bulgaria as Governor-General of the autonomous Ottoman Province Eastern Rumelia. In this way, the de facto Unification of Bulgaria which had taken place on 18 September [O.S. 6 September] 1885, was de jure recognized. = Greece = The Union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia made Bulgaria de facto the second-largest state in the Balkans at that time after Turkey in Europe, a fact that a number of neighbouring countries could not accept. Athens immediately asked for territorial compensations and even threatened it would begin military actions. There were civilian demonstrations throughout Greece that prompted the government to declare war on Bulgaria. However, Greece and Bulgaria did not have a common border at that time and were separated by Ottoman territory. Also, intervention on the part of the British government helped soothe this agitation. = Serbia = Serbia's position was similar to that of Greece. The Serbians asked for considerable territorial compensations along the whole western border with Bulgaria. Rebuffed by Bulgaria, but assured of support from Austria-Hungary, king Milan I declared war on Bulgaria on . However, after the decisive Battle of Slivnitsa, the Serbs suffered a quick defeat and the Bulgarians advanced into Serbian territory up to Pirot. Austria-Hungary demanded the ceasing of military actions, threatening that otherwise the Bulgarian forces would meet Austro-Hungarian troops. The ceasefire was signed on 28 November 1885. On 3 March 1886, the peace treaty was signed in Bucharest. According to its terms, no changes were made along the Bulgarian-Serbian border, preserving the Unification of Bulgaria.

He was the son of John C. Spencer, Secretary of War in U.S. President John Tyler's administration, and the grandson of Ambrose Spencer, a New York politician and lawyer. Background Spencer was born in Canandaigua, New York. He was described as handsome, despite a \\"wandering eye\\" (possibly strabismus) which surgery was unable to correct. As a youth at Geneva College (now Hobart College), he was considered wild and uncontrollable despite displaying signs of high intelligence. His favorite reading matter was pirate stories. After an abortive stay at Union College - where he was a founder of the Chi Psi Fraternity - Spencer ran away and signed on a whaler at Nantucket. His father located him and convinced him that if a life on the sea was what he wanted, to live it as \\"a gentleman\\"; i.e., as a commissioned officer. As Secretary of War, it was easy for Spencer's father to procure his son a midshipman's commission. Spencer proved to be just as intractable as ever, assaulting a superior officer aboard twice while under the influence of alcohol. Reassigned to , he was involved in a drunken brawl with a Royal Navy officer while on shore leave in Rio de Janeiro. He was allowed to resign rather than face court-martial, but due to his father's position in the Cabinet, his resignation was not accepted. Instead, he was posted to . Aboard Somers, Spencer gained favor with the ratings - many of whom were boys - through his privileged access to tobacco and rum. He also exhibited an irreverent attitude toward the navy and his captain, Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. In November 1842, during the return home from a voyage to Liberia, suspicion arose that Spencer had formed a plan to seize Somers and sail her as a pirate ship. His friendship with crew members Samuel Cromwell and Elisha Small was cited as evidence, as both these men were rumored to have sailed aboard slavers in the past. USS Somers, 1842 lithograph, with men hanging from yardarm. On November 26, Spencer was shackled and detained on Somers' foredeck after a list of names was found in his razor case. The names had been written using Greek letters. The following day, Cromwell and Small were also detained on the foredeck. After a meeting of the ship's officers, all three men were hanged on the yardarm on December 1 (at ). Spencer was nearly 20 years old. =Court of Inquiry= When the brig returned to New York, the Secretary of the Navy convened a court of flag officers to investigate the matter. Following a month of testimony, on January 23, 1843, the court of inquiry exonerated the captain and his officers, ruling the hangings fully justified. Although the commander was exonerated, public opinion was against him. Mackenzie requested that he be charged and tried by court martial. The court martial acquitted him on a split vote. =Court of public opinion= The government accepted the court's decision, but the acquittal did not satisfy public concerns with the case. Many commentators, including James Fenimore Cooper, denounced the hangings as murder and criticized the Navy's handling of the matter as an example of what today could be called a \\"whitewash.\\" The circumstance of Spencer, Cromwell and Small's deaths is one reason the U.S. Navy stopped training boys at sea and founded the United States Naval Academy. The event on USS Somers may be the only mutiny on a warship in US Navy history.
